<HD>The Heart of the Matter</HD>
<DH>GHOSTS OF TSAVO: Stalking the Mystery Lions of East Africa,
By Philip Caputo, Adventure Press , National Geographic, 273 pp., $27</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD>John Balzar is a columnist for The Times and was the
Nairobi bureau chief from 1994 to 1995.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long into this inquiry about the lions of Kenya's Tsavo National
Park, Philip Caputo concedes: " ... my heart hasn't been into it."
Readers will have beaten him to the conclusion.</LD>
<LD>   "Ghosts of Tsavo" reads like a collection of note cards for a
vacation slide show, prepared by a man who left behind most of his
slides, but never mind, because well, the trip was pretty OK, except
when I had a bad reaction to my medicine, but anyway, we took some
walks, and the lions mostly slept, except for sometimes, and I met
all kinds of people ....</LD>
<LD>   Caputo is a far better writer than he demonstrates here. When he
puts his heart into it--chiefly on matters of war--he has something
to say and the driving voice to say it. In fiction and in memoir, he
is also a man infected with "go-fever," as he once put it, for the
crackle of atmospheric places and adrenaline of danger. Perhaps the
oversized and mythicized lions of eastern Kenya's thorn brush just
weren't enough.</LD>
<TE>   Surely it was not enough to narrow the topic, as he does, into a
inconclusive investigation into the possible reasons why the male
lions of Tsavo have scruffy or nonexistent manes. That may make a
satisfactory installment for National Geographic magazine, but it
runs dry quickly when padded by miscellany into a book.</TE>
<TE>   Caputo was drawn by "The Man-Eaters of Tsavo," the story, now
legend, of two giant lions who killed 135 laborers and terrorized
hundreds more during the construction of the first rail line into
British East Africa in 1898. That classic travel-adventure journal
was of an age when the British were still trying to get their arms
around their exotic empire, when Africa's lions did not snooze away
their afternoons surrounded by circles of tourist-laden minivans.</TE>
<TE>   "Ghosts of Tsavo" assumes that the contemporary rampage of a lion
far removed in Zambia is enough reason to revisit this mother of all
lion stories back in Kenya in the company of sundry scientists and
photo-safari guides. After all, Caputo asserts in his opening
paragraph, to Americans "a predator that devoured humans was a threat
even more remote than famine or plague, pretty much on the same level
of possibility as an invasion of extraterrestrials."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the writer was busy and missed last summer's headlines
about shark attacks in Florida. Or the tragedy of the occasional
mountain lion to haunt a California suburb. Or the periodic grizzly
bear maulings in Alaska and Montana.</TE>
<TE>   With this book, the die-hard Caputo fan will find it a long slog
between watering holes for the chance to see him take on the panorama
and drama of Africa. The rest of us have little reason to bother this
time.</TE>

<DH>ELEAZAR, EXODUS TO THE WEST, A Novel, By Michel Tournier,
Translated from the French By Jonathan F. Krell, University of
Nebraska Press: 90 pp., $16.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELVIN JULES BUKIET</AU>
<BD>Melvin Jules Bukiet is the author of, most recently,
"Strange Fire" and "Nothing Makes You Free: Writings by Descendants
of Jewish Holocaust Survivors." He teaches at Sarah Lawrence College.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a contemporary fad for retelling stories of the Bible evident
in such books as Anita Diamant's "The Red Tent" and Jenny Diski's
"Only Human," few writers are able to approach this material with
anything like the purity and passion of the original. One such writer
is Michel Tournier.</LD>
<LD>   Renowned in France, Tournier has most frequently found literary
inspiration in earlier works and eras. He replayed the tale of
Robinson Crusoe in "Friday," examined the life of the Magi in "The
Four Wise Men"--yes, four--and gave his protagonist a job on the
hunting preserve of German Reichs- marschall Hermann Goring in his
most sinisterly accomplished book, "The Ogre."</LD>
<LD>   All of these novels look at what most would consider their central
stories--Crusoe, Jesus, the Holocaust--from the point of view of a
character to the side of the action. In his latest book, "Eleazar,
Exodus to the West," Tournier works by analogy rather than by
indirection, as he sets the story of Moses first in pre-potato-famine
Ireland and then in mid-19th century America.
Shepherd-turned-minister-turned Wild West pioneer, Eleazar O'Braid is
an echo of Moses.</LD>
<TE>   Events in O'Braid's life uncannily reiterate the story of Exodus.
For example, when O'Braid sees a young boy mistreated by a landlord's
steward, he lifts his snake-headed walking stick and strikes the man
dead as Moses slew an Egyptian slave master whom he caught abusing a
worker.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing capture for this crime, O'Braid leads his family into
exile. After a brutal sea voyage comparable to the Jews' journey
through Sinai, he aims for California, the name of which
echoes--O'Braid is quite conscious of this--Canaan.</TE>
<TE>   If all that "Eleazar, Exodus to the West" did was to formulaically
repeat the Bible, we might as well turn to the original, but Tournier
is at ease with odd, syncretic discrepancy. The boat's passage takes
40 days and 40 nights, harking back to the Noah story more than 40
years in the wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the wilderness portion of O'Braid's journey through the
West has yet to begin, and Tournier's sympathy wavers between figures
of the Old and New Testament. While Tournier tells O'Braid's story
fully of Mosaic episodes, he does so from the Gospel's perspective.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, Tournier is careful to avoid too absolute an
identification between O'Braid and Moses. The former, after all, is
"not a madman who thought he was Moses ... he felt his own story to
be powerfully attracted to, modeled on, and lent significance by the
radiance of the Prophet's destiny." Even when the coincidences mount,
the author simply speculates, "[C]ould not Eleazar thus believe
himself placed under [Moses'] spiritual guidance?" Note that he asks
a question rather than making a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, Tournier portrays O'Braid, his lame harp-playing wife
Esther and their two children, Benjamin and Coralie, as vivid and
unique individuals. Benjamin is a lively, curious boy who is bitten
by a rattlesnake that he pokes with a stick, though to symbol-seeking
Eleazar it seems as if the "aggression by the desert against his son
had an initiatory significance."</TE>
<TE>   Coralie is a natural skeptic who slyly comments in catechism
class, "The disciples drank the blood ... but did Jesus himself drink
his own blood?" Yet she also has a mystical streak. When the family
discovers an arrow in the side of its wagon one morning, she stops
Eleazar from removing it. Later, it turns out that the arrow was
fired at the moon by a native hunter. The Indians who subsequently
threaten the O'Braids see the arrow and, believing that it was sent
back from the heavens, grant the family safe passage.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Indians are portrayed with fully human idiosyncrasy when
the chief, who helps to heal Benjamin, explicates on the nature of
the snake, "Malignant inversion is his vocation."</TE>
<TE>   Most extraordinary about Tournier's metaphysical western is the
language that he and his characters speak. It's unafraid of authority
and grandeur whether it's describing a Cincinnati slaughterhouse or a
moment of bucolic rapture. Here is one example: "Green Ireland had
come between [Eleazar] and the Scriptures. Only the perfectly dry and
transparent desert air respected the brutal facts of biblical law."</TE>
<TE>   "Eleazar, Exodus to the West" is filled with similar images that
reflect dual aspects of nature and theology in a manner both
resolutely clear and mysteriously evocative. Water and fire serve as
elementally alternative modes of existence when Tournier compares the
"parched barrenness" of the New World to "the soft, wet soul of
Ireland." Indeed, he recognizes "a fundamental choice between the
Spring and the Bush" though he is far too cagey to affirm one
Testament over the other. Instead, he lets the symbols clash as they
may among the fields of different Lords.</TE>
<TE>   Often accused of perversity, Tournier has made mystical compulsion
nearly cauterizing as he simultaneously tells the ancient story of
Moses and the 19th century tale of O'Braid. In the meantime, the
overlap creates some of the suspense: Because Moses dies in Sinai
before he can enter the Promised Land, a reader is prepared for
Eleazar's death yet not certain it will occur.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the book continues to honor the desperate physical
privation of O'Braid's pilgrimage, as well as to respect the
intuition of something beyond. Call it spiritual if you dare. An
ocean and a continent are merely the geographical entities crossed in
"Eleazar, Exodus to the West." What's really crossed here is the
boundary between quotidian experience and genuine insight.</TE>

<HD>Streets With No Name</HD>
<DH>CITY, A Novel, By Alessandro Baricco , Translated from the
Italian by Ann Goldstein,  Alfred A. Knopf: 326 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE CIABATTARI</AU>
<BD>Jane Ciabattari is the author of the short-story
collection "Stealing the Fire" and a contributing editor to Parade
magazine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Silk," a pared-down fable of a love story, elegant and spare, with
the soulful undertones of an operatic aria, put the Italian novelist
Alessandro Baricco on the American literary map when it was published
here in 1997. Set in the 1860s, it tells the story of a Frenchman who
travels to Japan to purchase silkworm eggs and develops an unrequited
love for a warlord's concubine. "Silk" reads like an obsessive dream.</LD>
<LD>   Baricco's next novel, "Ocean Sea" (1999), was a dreamily lyrical
historical novel about a painter, a professor, a beautiful woman, a
young girl who is dying and a sailor driven mad by what he has seen.
As in "Silk," Baricco's knowledge of opera and philosophy added a
rich counterpoint to the work.</LD>
<LD>   "City," Baricco's new novel, is neither spare nor lyrical. The
first novel Baricco has set in America and in contemporary times is
an overstuffed and rapid-fire phantasmagoria of competing stories
that edge one another off the page. There's a western, a boxing story
about an underdog training to become a world champ, the story of a
barber who cuts hair free on Thursdays and of a kid who plays
basketball, all overridden by a cunning "Harold and Maude"-style love
story between an isolated boy genius and a loner named Shatzy Shell.</LD>
<TE>   "City" begins with a telephone call. Gould, the 13-year-old
genius, calls the hotline of CRB, the company that publishes a
cartoon about Ballon Mac, "a blind superhero who works as a dentist
by day and at night battles Evil using the special powers of his
saliva." Gould's call is answered by 30-year-old Shatzy from Pomona,
a temp whose job it is to find out how readers of the 22-year-old
series feel about the next twist in the plot. The question she asks
him: Should the mother of Ballon Mac die? Shatzy ends up being fired
for staying on the line too long and accepts Gould's offer to be his
governess.</TE>
<TE>   Gould is a virtual orphan: His father is in the Army, his mother
in a psychiatric institution in Topeka. His fate was cast at age 6,
when he was discovered to have an IQ of 180. At 11, he graduated from
college in theoretical physics. His father flew in by helicopter from
the military base for the ceremonies, at which the rector said, "You,
Gould, are a billiard ball, and you run between the cushions of
knowledge tracing the infallible trajectory that will let you, with
our joy and sympathy, roll gently into the pocket of fame and success
... the name of that pocket is the Nobel Prize." Alienated from
anyone else his age, Gould spends his time in graduate studies at the
university and with his imaginary companions, a giant named Diesel
and a bald mute named Poomerang. He watches the soccer games behind
his house with a professor who trains him not to touch the ball.
"Either you watch or you play," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Shatzy is a bizarre loner, too. In a yellow bag with a "Save the
Planet Earth From Painted Toenails" logo, she carries framed photos
of Walt Disney and Eva Braun and a tape recorder into which she is
dictating her life work, a western featuring twin 63-year-old sisters
who can shoot two holes through the jack of hearts when you throw a
deck of cards into the air.</TE>
<TE>   Shatzy moves right into Gould's fantasy world. She accommodates
Diesel and Poomerang, even buys a yellow trailer large enough for
Diesel to fit in so they can travel. "Let's go see the world, Gould,"
she says, and she gives him his first kiss, an innocent one. She
discovers Gould's secrets--like the fantasy boxing matches he
narrates, usually while in the bathroom. The boxing story pits Larry
"the Lawyer" Gorman against all comers, with a trainer whose motto is
"Boxing: Do It If You're Hungry."</TE>
<TE>   Most effective is Mondrian Kilroy, Baricco's caricature of a
professor. His specialty is a lecture on Monet's "Water Lilies,"
which sets out to prove that Monet's goal was to paint nothingness.
Kilroy's masterwork, "the definitive and redeeming refutation of
whatever I have written, write, or will write," has caused him to
vomit from time to time; it is a six-point "Essay on Intellectual
Honesty" scribbled on the back of a program from a porn-video booth.
Shatzy is the one who sees how lonely life is for Gould, "a genius
who wets his bed at night and is afraid if someone on the street asks
him what time it is, and hasn't seen his mother for years and listens
to his father Friday nights on the telephone and will never go up to
a girl ...." Her influence is what gives him the courage to pick up a
soccer ball for the first time and to take off on his own, instead of
accepting a fellowship to a European university where he would
continue his narrow life.</TE>
<TE>   Baricco has inventiveness in spades, and his freaks have the
capacity to chill the blood or warm the heart. He treats his stories
as neighborhoods and his characters as streets in his impressionistic
city. The stories intersect at seemingly random moments, sometimes
mid-chapter, but these quick shifts don't always work. It's too easy
to get lost. Perhaps another draft would have given "City" the
combination of poetry and philosophical depth that distinguished his
previous work, but this American experiment is too fragmented to be
fully satisfying.</TE>

<DH>YOU'RE AN ANIMAL, VISKOVITZ!, By Alessandro Boffa,
Translated from the Italian  by John Casey with Maria Sanminiatelli,
Alfred A. Knopf: 182 pp., $18</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA CIOLKOWSKI</AU>
<BD>Laura Ciolkowski is a freelance writer and teaches
literature at New York University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In one of Alessandro Boffa's gloriously wacky Ovidian meditations on
sex, death and identity, "You're an Animal, Viskovitz!," the
shape-changing creature Viskovitz has metamorphosed into a
multicellular organism who meets his Maker and is forced to confront
the best and the worst of animal life. In the shape of an unassuming
Archeozoic era plasmodium, Viskovitz comes face to face with the
"primordial Microbe" and discovers that life as an animal has much to
offer him: the opportunity to kill and devour others; the chance to
"[f]ind someone you like and exchange some DNA"; and the possibility
that one day you will be able to indulge in an entertaining game
called "survival of the fittest." If animal life also carries with it
the certainty of death, this is part of the fun.</LD>
<TE>   In "You're an Animal, Viskovitz!" first-time author Boffa revels
in the bawdy and grim details of the animal kingdom, following
Viskovitz as he takes the shape of a magnificent array of animals,
from a narcissistic snail and a power-hungry ant to a sex-starved
sponge and a heroin-addicted dog. Boffa finds humor and wisdom in
Viskovitz the mantis, who pursues his love by using his "erection as
a crutch" because his mistress has already eaten three of his four
legs, and Viskovitz the scorpion, whose "savage instincts" inevitably
lead him to plant his stinger in the skull of his lover, shattering
his chances at developing a meaningful, long-term romantic
relationship with her.</TE>
<TE>   The animals of "You're an Animal, Viskovitz!" are first and
foremost sexual creatures, pleasure-seeking organisms that live and
die for the gratifications of the flesh. Viskovitz the laboratory rat
is elevated by his people to the place of a modern-day Moses for his
miraculous ability to push a lever and part the waters of a toilet.
But he ultimately gives up his freedom and his place as "the most
intelligent rodent who ever lived" to return to the cage and procure
a life of reproductive bliss with a ravishing female rat who is as
dumb as a doornail.</TE>
<TE>   The animals of Boffa's salacious menagerie are not just beastly;
they are also unmistakably human in their lust for greatness and
their eagerness to aspire to higher things. Viskovitz the rodent, who
also has shades of Jean-Paul Sartre, is driven by his sense that
there is more to life than his laboratory cage and the "endless
cycle" of mazes and rewards. He confesses, "The big questions
continued to torture me. The whole universe seemed nothing but a
series of mazes that led only to other mazes: plumbing, hallways,
canals, streets. How far would I have to travel before I found a way
out?"</TE>
<TE>   Viskovitz the ant also fights the apparent meaninglessness of his
animal existence but in his own way. Seeking immortality, he
undertakes a doomed project of distinctly human proportions when he
commands his ant army to sculpt "an imperishable testimony to my
Myrmidonian greatness" out of a decomposing loaf of bread. The battle
between the animal impulses hard-wired into rat, dormouse, dung
beetle or bull-elk and the human desire for something better is at
the heart of "You're an Animal, Viskovitz!" Boffa takes us on a comic
and revelatory romp through the anthills, cages, sewers and dens of
the animal world, producing a hilarious portrait of Viskovitz and his
friends as they experience the pleasures and dangers of an animal
life that all too often resembles our own.</TE>

<DH>UNCIVIL WARS: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery,
By David Horowitz,  Encounter Books: 148 pp., $21.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ</AU>
<BD>Alan M. Dershowitz is the author of "Shouting Fire:
Civil Liberties in a Turbulent Age." He is a professor at Harvard Law
School.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Horowitz, whose provocative ad against reparations for slavery
generated a firestorm on college campuses during the spring of 2001,
assures the readers of "Uncivil Wars," his self-serving account of
that controversy, that the book's "subject is not me, nor is it the
advertisement that provoked such a reaction." He claims that the
subject of his book is an idea: the "dubious idea of reparations"
and, in a larger sense, "the intellectual vulgarities of American
universities in an age of 'political correctness.'"</LD>
<LD>   This is a misleading characterization of "Uncivil Wars," which is,
in fact, all about Horowitz and his in-your-face brand of
confrontation. Reparations are an important symbol of black
solidarity on college campuses, and his ad was calculated to stir raw
emotions. If it was accepted for publication, he knew it would create
a backlash against the editors who agreed to publish it. If it was
rejected, he knew he could cry "censorship." An editor at the Daily
Princetonian, whose column Horowitz quotes in "Uncivil Wars," got it
exactly right when he wrote:</LD>
<TE>   "Horowitz plays a clever game. He played it with several of our
peer college papers in the past few weeks. And he won. When Horowitz
submits an ad to a college paper, he hopes that one of two things
will happen: Either the paper refused to print the ad, so he can tell
the world that conservative ideas are being censored by the liberal
college press, or the paper prints the ad and campus activists
protest. Both ways, Horowitz gets what he wants.... "</TE>
<TE>   Although Horowitz disputes the accuracy of this description, he
acknowledges that he relished "the opportunity to bait the tiger in
its lair" when he was invited to Princeton. Baiting is exactly the
right word to describe his style. Although he devotes many pages of
his book to proving that he is not a racist and, indeed, his animus
is based not on the color of people's skin but on their attitudes
regarding race, he is a race-issue-baiter. It is a distinction likely
to be blurred in the emotionally charged atmosphere Horowitz enjoys
provoking.</TE>
<TE>   His repeated claims that the ad was not "intentionally
inflammatory" are unconvincing, and he fails to tell his readers that
his tactic was not original. Several years ago a man named Bradley
Smith used the same tactic when he submitted a Holocaust denial ad to
college newspapers around the country.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Horowitz omits this history from his account because he
does not want to be associated with Holocaust denial, which is
understandable. There is a considerable difference between what
Horowitz has written, which is largely a matter of opinion, and what
Smith wrote, which was demonstrably false. But their tactics are
similar.</TE>
<TE>   Horowitz is a master in the art of overstatement. He describes
professor Charles Ogletree as exhibiting "hostility to America
generally and to white Americans in particular." Now I may lack some
objectivity with regard to this accusation because Ogletree is my
colleague at Harvard Law School, but in all the years I have known
him, both as a student and as colleague, I have never heard him
express anti-American or anti-white sentiments. Nor does Horowitz
quote or cite a single word uttered by Ogletree, beyond his support
for reparations, that would justify such a defamatory
characterization.</TE>
<TE>   Horowitz's overstatements are not limited to his descriptions of
individuals. They extend as well to the central thesis of his book,
namely that there is a pervasive censorship of ideas in colleges all
over the country and that conservative views cannot be expressed on
most college campuses. He is certainly correct that there is a
problem of political correctness on many college campuses as
reflected in the childish speech codes that have been enacted in many
places. But conservative clubs are alive and well on numerous college
campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the conservative viewpoint is welcomed, indeed sought,
by the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, National Review, the Weekly
Standard, Fox Television and dozens of other media outlets. These
media sources are available on college campuses. The conservative
voice has a megaphone in Washington and is championed by many of the
most powerful forces in America.</TE>
<TE>   This is not to deny that some divisive ideas--particularly about
race and gender--are unwelcome by administrators, faculty members and
students in many colleges and universities. But Horowitz fails to
understand--or more likely understands but fails to acknowledge--that
his deliberately provocative ad was not well designed to test whether
certain ideas are acceptable on college campuses but rather to test
whether certain incendiary attacks on important racial symbols will
provoke an emotional response. Despite this failure, he makes an
important point.</TE>
<TE>   Horowitz tells us that he was called a racist for expressing the
idea that "white Americans died to free American slaves" and that he
was characterized as "anti-black" for praising Jefferson and Lincoln
as "heroes of liberty for all Americans." This may be the case, but
it is not representative of most college campuses, where many
professors of history express those views routinely without
criticism. It was most likely the manner by which Horowitz expressed
these views, and the divisive context in which he offered them, that
resulted in the emotional response he had surely anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   Horowitz understands that he has provoked raw emotions. He
repeatedly focuses on students bursting "into tears" or being unable
to "perform basic functions like walking or sleeping because of this
ad." In this respect Horowitz is something of a bully, since he is a
mature adult who knows how to take advantage of the sensitivities and
emotions of young students. He may not be completely deaf about
nuance and tone, but he is certainly "tone challenged" (to use a
politically correct term he would despise) or else he deliberately
turns off his tone aid when it comes to issues of race.</TE>
<TE>   Does this mean that Horowitz should be compelled to attend
"sensitivity training" on race dialogue? Or that he ought to be
called a racist? Or that his speech should be silenced? Of course
not. He should be criticized (or praised, depending on one's
perspective) in the marketplace of ideas both for the content of some
of his views and for the manner by which he often expresses them.</TE>
<TE>   Precisely because "Uncivil Wars" is a book about Horowitz and his
style of inciting divisive and emotional reactions, its implications
are somewhat limited. He does succeed in demonstrating that many
students have thin skins, many faculty members limited vision and
many administrators little courage when provoked by insensitive
speech--and that such speech must be fully protected. He is naive to
expect polite responses to his provocations. Provocateurs should not
expect--as he apparently does--civil libertarians to rush to defend
the substance of their views. Provocateurs shouldn't whine--as he
does--when they succeed in provoking irrational responses.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson of this controversy is to refuse to take the bait of
race issue baiters such as Horowitz. Always remember that they are
seeking "the opportunity to bait the tiger in his lair." Don't fall
for it. The answer to bad speech is not censorship. It is more and
better speech.</TE>

<DH>SUNDAY JEWS: A Novel, By Hortense Calisher, Harcourt: 694
pp., $28</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LAURIE GOODMAN</AU>
<BD>Jill Laurie Goodman is a New York lawyer and a book
reviewer for various newspapers, including the Chicago Tribune and
the Forward.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Are all upper middle-class academic families eccentric in the same
way? Are all assimilated Jewish and half-Jewish families neurotic in
their different ways? And can a novelist make of such families
something not just engaging but important? These are questions
suggested by "Sunday Jews" by nonagenarian and grande dame of New
York letters Hortense Calisher. Beginning in 1951, Calisher, a
quintessential New Yorker, has chronicled modern life in 14 novels, a
host of memorable short stories and not one but two autobiographies.</LD>
<LD>   At the emotional center of "Sunday Jews" is Zipporah Duffy, nee
Zangwell. A New York matriarch in her mid-60s when the book opens,
she is the woman who has had--and will continue to have throughout
the next 30 years and in the course of this long novel--everything
that life has to offer.</LD>
<LD>   When we meet her, she is lithe and slender, often mistaken for her
daughters' older sister. Zipporah presides with grace and ease over a
large household and an adoring family from her huge Central Park West
apartment. Money is never an object, and there is always plenty of
loyal help to keep the cookie jar full, track down loved ones who
have dropped out of sight or nurse the dying so they are spared
hospitals and even pain in their final illnesses.</LD>
<TE>   A social anthropologist without portfolio, Zipporah has been able
to travel far and wide on a string of grants, visiting huts and
hamlets in exotic locales and writing a study of images of God that
is respectfully received. Peter, her husband of 40 years, is a
professor of philosophy, adored by his students. He cheerfully allows
Zipporah's secular brand of Judaism to prevail over his own lapsed
Catholicism.</TE>
<TE>   Zipporah's progeny also are preternaturally fortunate, although
maybe a bit less so than the fabulous Zipporah. Zach, for example,
the youngest, a successful artist, has a wife and an ex-wife who
sweetly accept that he needs both of them in his life. These two
women are fond not only of him but also of each other and the male
twins each has borne him. Nell, the older daughter, described as "a
Sephardic queen ... but with gentile gams" and as "a Renaissance
madonna," is a lawyer with a brood of children by various fathers and
a string of admiring lovers and ex-lovers. When she is told she needs
a double mastectomy, she repairs to a "small, gnarled inn ... above
Lake Como" where the townspeople believe she is a saint with magical
powers. She apparently gets some treatment although, on her return to
New York, the family is never quite sure.</TE>
<TE>   "Sunday Jews" does have a plot, or at least the simulacrum of a
plot. There are a murder (or maybe two), diamonds, a long-lost
brother, a packet entrusted to Zipporah, then buried in a linen
closet for 10 years and a widow who turns out to never have been a
wife. Of course, there is the love angle. In fact, there are two: one
for Zipporah, who loses Peter in the first third of the book to find
a tall, courtly, mythically rich and endlessly accommodating consort
with whom she maintains an erotic life into her late 80s, and one for
her rabbi grandson Bert.</TE>
<TE>   But the plot of "Sunday Jews" teases and suggests where the story
should connect and satisfy. A murderer is never sought, let alone
unmasked; the lost brother appears briefly and, unrecognized, quietly
vanishes. Events that look as if they are meant to be momentous
neither reverberate nor transform, but simply fade.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, plot is submerged in the plump cushions of
leisurely digression. Luckily, Calisher's digressions are
entertaining. As she weaves back and forth in time over Zipporah's
long life, Calisher provides social commentary as dense as the Torah
commentary that Zipporah's family, centuries ago, must have studied.</TE>
<TE>   Zipporah finds hierarchies and telling distinction everywhere; in
shoes, in noses (fixed and unfixed) and in various modes of New York
City transport (subways versus cabs versus buses). Private schools
are such significant markers of status in this world that Calisher
suggests a childless couple is unreadable. "There's no way of
knowing," Calisher writes, about Zipporah's neighbor Norman and his
wife, "what schools they might have sent their children to--as yet
one of the surest ways of measuring how far a couple might be
straying from Judaism, and toward what."</TE>
<TE>   The most thoroughly cataloged and dissected phenomenon in "Sunday
Jews" is, of course, Jewish people. Calisher's cast of Jews and
Jewish types is immense. Besides Zipporah's half-Jewish, entirely
assimilated brood, there are a native-born Israeli army nurse and a
Scottish convert. There is Philippe, a French Jew from a family of
conversos, the converted Jews of Spain, whose family for several
centuries continued to marry only other conversos. There is cousin
Mord, "that recognizable Jew whose gloom is marketable, in the art
world taken to be talent, on Wall Street assumed to signify
foreknowledge and in a government job functions as prophecy."</TE>
<TE>   The number of breeds and the exotic plumage of the Jews that
Calisher collects are diverting but also misleading. Her Jews are
weighted toward the unsettled, the uncomfortable and the disaffected.
They tend to be Jews united "by a Talmud they have never read ... or
the kinship of having been forced to play the violin," and though
they may, like Zipporah, feel "Jewish to the core of birth, bone and
memory," they are forever navigating and negotiating their identity,
which isn't an easy task.</TE>
<TE>   Zipporah's aunt warned her early that "Jewish humor was
coarse--and part of what had got Jews into trouble historically."
Cousin Charlotte wishes she were Christian, and grandson James,
a.k.a. Jeremy, a.k.a. Jacob Ezekiel Duffy, "can't separate the
uneasiness he causes others from his own." When grandson Bert
announces that he intends to study for the rabbinate, his mother
says, "Some Jews are too Jewish." As he approaches middle age, Bert
still doesn't believe in God, and he remains "in his heart a refugee
from something." So too does the sabra he marries, who has fled her
land of milk and honey for gray London.</TE>
<TE>   With these characters, Calisher has created a colorful gallery of
Jewish portraits. It is also a limited and ungenerous one. Jews who
are comfortable in their skins and their faith are absent. When
Calisher states flatly that "in an ordinary converse ... the Jew has
trouble saying the word Jew," she reveals more about her own
prejudices and predilections than she may intend.</TE>
<TE>   Chatty, opinionated, "Sunday Jews" is a book full of judgments. It
may not matter how accurate a portrait it is of late-20th century
upper-middle-class life in New York City or how penetrating a picture
it may be of the various permutations of Jewish families. Gazing
affectionately at her own family during one of her famous Sunday
afternoon parties, Zipporah says, "May what I've engendered always
amuse." What Calisher has engendered in "Sunday Jews" does, for the
most part, amuse, and that may be enough.</TE>

<DH>SIN KILLER, A Novel, By Larry McMurtry, Simon &amp; Schuster:
300 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The indefatigable Larry McMurtry has rounded us up yet again, herding
us along a fictional trail that promises to be even longer in miles
and pages than the cattle drive in "Lonesome Dove."</LD>
<LD>   This time, however, McMurtry is going to let us rest now and then.
"Sin Killer," he says, is the first volume of a "four-decker, in
which we follow the adventures of a great English sporting family,
the Berrybenders, as they make their way through the American West in
the years 1832-36." The novels are set on or near the four rivers
they travel: the Missouri, the Yellowstone, the Rio Grande and the
Brazos.</LD>
<LD>   This is the Missouri segment. In 1832, Lord Albany Berrybender,
infatuated with the idea of shooting animals he has never shot
before, charters a steamboat in St. Louis and heads upriver with his
wife, his mistress, several of his 14 children, a small army of
servants and hired boatmen, three chiefs returning to their tribes
after a diplomatic mission to Washington and a few real people,
including frontier artist George Catlin.</LD>
<TE>   From the beginning, the vacuum of the empty prairies they pass
through tugs at the group's feudal hierarchy and Old World
certainties. No one is more affected than the oldest Berrybender
daughter, Tasmin, who jumps ship to marry Jim Snow, a mountain man
also known as the Sin Killer because of his religious convictions.</TE>
<TE>   Jim is a man of few words, Tasmin a woman of many. She is a
voracious reader; he can barely decipher a few Bible verses (his
conversion having come not in church but by having been struck by
lightning and survived). At bottom, she is as practical as he but, in
a wilderness she knows only through the novels of James Fenimore
Cooper, she is for the moment ignorant and foolish.</TE>
<TE>   Their romance and their quarrels proceed in a way that seems oddly
familiar until we realize that Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn
played these characters, under different names, in more than one
movie. "Sin Killer" is a comedy, though it can be downright grim--a
balance that McMurtry achieved in his last novel, "Boone's Lick," and
that no other writer of westerns has quite matched.</TE>
<TE>   On McMurtry's frontier, as on the real one, the penalty for
stupidity or bad luck is severe. Two women captured from the
steamboat and held for ransom in a Mandan village are beaten by the
tribe's women and raped by its men. McMurtry says so plainly; but
although the beatings are described in detail, we are spared the
rapes. They would have upset the balance, disturbed the tone.</TE>
<TE>   McMurtry has never been one to sentimentalize Native Americans.
The Mandans are doomed--smallpox nearly wiped them out in 1837--and
therefore pitiable; but the individual members of this tribe and
others in the novel are intelligent and dull, cruel and generous in
the same proportion as the white people.</TE>
<TE>   Lord Albany's foolishness is deeply ingrained, and he pays for it
with parts of his anatomy (though without losing his zest for the
chase). While buffalo hunting, he shoots off part of his foot. An
enraged chief with a knife lops off some of his fingers. Caught in a
blizzard, he is frostbitten and may lose a leg. The prospect is
unnervingly real that he will be limbless before two novels of the
four are done.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, by the point "Sin Killer" ends--with the steamboat stuck
in the ice, still 100 miles from the safety of Ft. Yellowstone--the
casualty list is extensive. Other members of the party, drawn by the
freedom of the West, have deserted. Just as Lord Albany has run out
of claret--a whole keelboat full of it, pilfered and drunk by the
boatmen--one could fear that McMurtry will run out of characters. But
new people turn up as the expedition moves west. Characters who have
minor roles in "Sin Killer"--such as Tasmin's sister Mary, a sinister
12-year-old who talks to snakes and smells out edible roots--are
surely destined for bigger things. And it's worth noting that no
fewer than three of the women, including Tasmin and Lord Albany's
mistress, are pregnant.</TE>

<DH>THE WEATHER IN BERLIN, A Novel, By Ward Just, Houghton
Mifflin: 320 pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH KANON</AU>
<BD>Joseph Kanon is the author of, most recently, "The Good
German," set in postwar Berlin.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ward Just writes the kind of books they say no one writes anymore:
smart, well-crafted narratives--wise to the ways of the world--that
use fiction to show us how we live. The kind of books, in fact, that
most novels tried to be before confession and dysfunction cut their
wide swath across the literary landscape.</LD>
<LD>   His books are conventional, perhaps, but still the gleam in the
eye of every journalist who, in the folklore and like Just himself,
traded in the city desk for a battered typewriter in a room somewhere
(Paris, preferably) to wrestle his prose into a semblance of real
life.</LD>
<LD>   Cynical on the outside, Bogart romantic on the inside, Just even
has the rumpled lived-in features that would look perfect in a trench
coat. But he gave the cliche new life by writing the books the others
just talked about writing. And he keeps getting better. "The Weather
in Berlin" is his 13th novel, after "A Dangerous Friend" and the
excellent "Echo House," and one of his finest. It has so many of the
pleasures of a conventional good read that you may not notice, at
least for a while, the ambition and mastery poking modestly between
the lines.</LD>
<TE>   Certainly the premise is conventional enough. A middle-aged film
director, Dixon Greenwood, fearful that he's lost his audience and
his inspiration, finds his life unraveling and, with nothing better
to do, accepts an invitation to spend the winter as
artist-in-residence at the Mommsen Institute in Berlin. (Just himself
spent the winter of 1999 at the American Academy there; rarely has a
foundation stay paid off so well.) For Greenwood, it proves a fateful
choice.</TE>
<TE>   His best film, "Summer, 1921," a lyrical account of three bohemian
artists and the girls they spend a summer with on a Franconian lake,
was shot there in 1972 and, predictably, a return to Germany brings
the past rushing back, something to pick over during the long
evenings in the institute's Wannsee villa. So far,
we've-been-here-before territory. But not quite.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of plot turns that ultimately bring Greenwood back to
professional life, we are taken on a series of fascinating detours: a
whole society (the former East Germany) that, like Greenwood, has
lost its audience and is left behind and resentful; the remembered
music at a country club dance; a walk through the Seelow countryside,
a battlefield in 1945 and now "a giant ossuary disguised as a simple
farm"; meditations on the nature of storytelling in all its forms,
from anecdotes over drinks to the framing of camera shots; and, not
least, the contradictory haunted world of contemporary Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   Great cities attract us in different ways. Berlin has never been
beautiful or graceful, and certainly no one goes for the food. The
legend of its Weimar heyday, all sexual license and cultural ferment,
owes much to the nostalgia of the intellectual diaspora that
followed. But what it has, uniquely, is the drama of its own
survival.</TE>
<TE>   "Berlin was a narrator's utopia," Greenwood thinks, "the story of
the world, ruin and rebirth." Just is so good at capturing the look
and feel of the city (his suburban Wannsee is pitch perfect) that I
wish Greenwood had left the villa more often. But when he does get
into town, Just gives it to us in knowing, precise strokes. The
esplanade down the middle of Karl Marx Allee has the aspect of "the
exercise yard in a penitentiary." Even the weather, famously gray,
becomes "a soft, gunmetal gray" or "a refugee gray," in each instance
just the right shade.</TE>
<TE>   More important, he makes the city work for his story. Berlin has
always drawn in its visitors: Some of its most famous literary
images, from Christopher Isherwood's seedy cabaret to John le Carre's
spy dropping from the wall, have been created by foreigners. This
city where "the old wind lingered, a part of every day" becomes, with
all its baggage and shadows, a plausible place for Greenwood to
recover a lost piece of his past that will lead him to his audience
again. The weather in Berlin, after all, is "motion picture weather,
you could make of it whatever you wished."</TE>
<TE>   Not everything here plays out so neatly. There is a political
protest that feels more worked up than real, bits of dialogue that
slip into pure exposition and moments when the pace goes, well, a
little slack: One way or another, a lot of time is spent looking out
windows at the lake. But it seems almost unfair to complain when
right afterward, there will be something so skillfully handled that
you can take delight simply in what's happening on the page.</TE>
<TE>   Just gives us not one but two stories-within-a-story ("Summer,
1921" and a German television costume drama)--a technique that can be
as boring as listening to someone's dream--and, improbably, gets away
with both. His novel has texture: characters with families and pasts,
meals eaten, the smell of a wounded animal, landscapes in sharp, deep
focus. It's not postmodern--irony here is wry disappointment--and
it's not in your face.</TE>
<TE>   It has the feel of spending an evening with someone who talks very
well and knows what he's talking about. That is not all fiction can
do, but sometimes it can count for a lot. If you haven't read a novel
in a while, try "The Weather in Berlin." You'd be surprised what
you've been missing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `The Weather in Berlin'</TE>
<TE>   The remains of a demonstration littered the streets converging on
Potsdamer Platz. The streets were mostly deserted, dust and bits of
paper flying here and there on the wind. Everywhere he looked were
construction sites, office buildings and hotels in various stages of
completion, and empty lots on which anything could be imagined--a
missile silo, Chartres Cathedral, or a Burger King the size of the
Reichstag. Dix thought of toys piled under a Christmas tree, the
children tearing into one package and discarding it at once for the
next, believing in tomorrow's newer, shinier gift. Meanwhile, the
wrappings accumulated. Sections of the Wall were visible now and
again, a reminder of how things were not so long ago. The wild
aspiration of the construction, cranes towering everywhere over the
ravaged earth, gave the district a kind of clamorous optimism, a
fresh Wagnerian Book of Fate, not the twilight of the gods but the
dawn. The city was emptying its treasury in the hope that a new world
of steel and glass was at hand, the world bearing a superficial
resemblance to Los Angeles. Surely the Rhinegold was in there
somewhere.</TE>

<DH>OFFBEAT: Collaborating With Kerouac, By David Amram,

Jean-Francois Duval, Translated from the French by Alison Ardron, Sun

<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch, a contributing writer to Book Review,
is the author of, most recently "The Woman Who Laughed at God: The
Untold History of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Kerouac opened a million coffee bars," quipped Beat novelist William
Burroughs about the so-called King of the Beat Generation, "and sold
a million pairs of Levis to both sexes." The first draft of Jack
Kerouac's "On the Road"--a 119-foot scroll of teletype paper--was
sold at auction in 2001 for $2.4 million. And yet, as Kerouac lay
dying in 1969, he was tormented by the fact that his books were being
remaindered by his American publishers.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm an author!" he raged. "By your works ye shall be known!"</LD>
<LD>   Ironically, Kerouac and the Beats are the subject of an
ever-growing library of history, memoir and biography that surely
surpasses in sheer quantity the poetry and prose that they actually
produced. Among the latest titles, the most sentimental effort is
"Offbeat," an autobiography by composer David Amram, who befriended
Kerouac during the mid-1950s, when the Beat myth was still in the
making.</LD>
<TE>   "Each day was a struggle for survival," Amram writes of the early
days, when he and Kerouac collaborated on the now-legendary
performances of improvisational jazz and poetry that were the purest
expression of the Beats. "Each day was a celebration of life, and a
new day in school as prize students in our own homemade University of
Hang-out-ology."</TE>
<TE>   "Offbeat" is filled with intimate anecdotes and reconstructed
conversations that feature some of the most famous Beats, principally
Kerouac but also Allen Ginsberg, Neal Cassady, Gregory Corso and
Lawrence Ferlinghetti. The death of Kerouac is the central point of
the narrative, and Amram devotes the second half of the book to a
memoir of his own career as a composer of movie scores ("The
Manchurian Candidate") and orchestral works ("Autobiography for
Strings") as well as, not incidentally, to his efforts to keep the
memory of the Beats alive.</TE>
<TE>   Amram decries "the plague of the Beatnik Myth [that] tarred and
feathered so many of us," and he seeks to reclaim the purity of
aspiration that he recalls from the dues-paying years with Kerouac.
"Don't let what we started die, Davey," a failing Kerouac says to
Amram shortly before his death, and Amram replies with a vow: "I
won't, Jack. No way."</TE>
<TE>   On the day of Kerouac's death, Amram reveals, he "prayed for his
soul and said a Kaddish and kissed an old Mass card that he had given
me in 1957." Much of the same piety can be discerned in "Offbeat,"
which is less about telling hard truths than a way of honoring his
promise to his dear old friend.</TE>
<TE>   To call Charles Bukowski a "post-Beat" is not only a matter of
strict chronology, according to Jean-Francois Duval in "Bukowski and
the Beats," but also a description of his poetic stance. The Beats
may have prepared a readership that was ready to embrace the
in-your-face poetry and gut-punching fiction of Bukowski in the late
1960s and after, but Buk, as Bukowski is called in this admiring and
well-informed appreciation of his life and work, insisted that he
"felt closer to the punks than the Beatniks."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care if you are a fake," Bukowski once told Ginsberg.
"Everybody knows that after 'Howl' you never wrote anything worth a
----."</TE>
<TE>   But Bukowski was a beneficiary of the Beats in more than one
sense, as Duval points out. Bukowski may have lampooned Ginsberg and
other Beats in "Notes of a Dirty Old Man," but the work came to be
published by Ferlinghetti, the original publisher of Ginsberg's
epochal poem and one of the last surviving Beats. And Bukowski basked
in the reflected light of the Beats when he joined a 1974 tour that
featured Ginsberg, Ferlinghetti and Gary Snyder; Bukowski marveled
that the Santa Cruz outing "drew 1,600 at 3 bucks."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Duval argues that Bukowski came from (and stayed in) a
darker place than the Beats and that stakes were higher for Bukowski
than for Ginsberg or Ferlinghetti: "While the Beats danced along the
road composing a hymn to their freedom from social proprieties,"
Duval explains, "Buk put in forty years to free himself from the
shackles which alcohol and poetry alone helped him to forget at
times."</TE>
<TE>   Kerouac's credo held that "the only people for me are the mad
ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk," and Bukowski's was
superficially similar: "Thank the gods that the first 50 years of my
life were spent with the Blue Collars and the truly mad, the truly
beaten." But Duval allows us to see that Kerouac was waxing poetic
while Bukowski was speaking literally: "Kerouac had his face
constantly turned toward God, toward an assumed paradise," insists
Duval. "Bukowski considered himself a painter of hell and the
grotesque."</TE>
<TE>   "Bukowski and the Beats" is full of affection and admiration for
Bukowski, but Duval brings a sharp edge and a smart take to his work,
which is composed of biography, literary criticism and cultural
history in equal measure, plus the transcript of a 1986 interview
with Bukowski titled "An Evening at Buk's Place." And the Who's Who
of Beat and post-Beat personalities that appears as an appendix to
Duval's book is a useful companion to all of the titles reviewed
here.</TE>
<TE>   For those who know the names of the Beats better than the works
that made them famous in the first place, an essential volume is
Carmela Ciuraru's "Beat Poets," a title in the Everyman's Library
Pocket Poets series.</TE>
<TE>   All of the Beats who figure so prominently in "Offbeat" and
"Bukowski and the Beats" appear in these pages--we get short excerpts
from Kerouac's "Mexico City Blues," Ginsberg's "Howl" and "Kaddish,"
Ferlinghetti's "#22" ("crazy to be alive in such a strange
world")--and many others besides, ranging from Ray Bremser's "City
Madness" to John Wieners' "A Poem for the Insane."</TE>
<TE>   "[A] rebellious, taunting cry against bourgeois intellectualism
and repression" is how Ciuraru sums up the Beat movement. But she
bluntly concedes that some of the poems in the collection are
"self-indulgent, sloppy and even at times incoherent." And she
reminds us that "Beat writings were often ridiculously misogynistic,"
a theme that interests Duval far more than Amram.</TE>
<TE>   As a kind of counterweight to the poetry itself, Ciuraru closes
out the collection with excerpts from the letters and other writings
of Donald Allen, Burroughs, Corso, Ferlinghetti, Ginsberg and
Kerouac, including their pronouncements on the subject of "poetics."
Kerouac, for example, validates much of what we read in Amram's and
Duval's books when he advises the aspiring poet to "be crazy
dumbsaint of the mind" and insists that "[m]y love of poetry is love
of joy."</TE>

<LD>To the editor:</LD>
<LD>   Richard Schickel, in reviewing "Radical Hollywood" by Paul Buhle
and Dave Wagner (Book Review, May 12), chooses to use the occasion
for a diatribe against the history of communists in Hollywood. Since
the issue of the role of dissent in a democratic society is very much
on the front burner in our country today, I believe it is important
to respond. My qualifications: I was one of the Hollywood communist
screenwriters; I was blacklisted because I refused to become an
informer for the House Un-American Activities Committee; and I was
hounded for more than 26 years by the FBI because, as a communist, I
was considered a threat to domestic security (along with more than
300 others from Hollywood).</LD>
<TE>   I agree with Schickel that neither I nor any of the comrades I
knew ever managed to sneak even a smidgen of communist propaganda
into any of our films. Had we done so, we felt sure that 200% of
American studio bosses like Louis B. Mayer, Jack Warner, Harry Cohn
and others would blue pencil us right out of a job. Nevertheless, we
did manage to slip some goodies into the character of the local
community. For example, Jean Lewin, a young woman who was a dear
friend of mine and also a member of the Communist Party, was the
executive secretary of the Hollywood Canteen, working with Bette
Davis, who was the president, and Jules Stein, who was the treasurer.
Literally thousands of servicemen bound for war in the Pacific were
entertained in a number of shifts of 500 each night for more than
three years. In those days there was strict segregation of blacks
from whites in the services, and even the Musicians Union had
separate black and white locals. But thanks to the efforts of Lewin,
a 5-foot, 100-pound communist, there was, after quite a battle with
the studio bosses, no discrimination or segregation at the Hollywood
Canteen. As a result, hundreds of thousands of men were exposed for
the first time to a social occasion where blacks and whites sat
together, ate together, danced with whomever they pleased. Was this
important? We thought so.</TE>
<TE>   As president of the Readers Guild (later the Story Analysts), I
negotiated the first contract for the group with the studios and was
active with the Conference of Studio Unions, the only truly
independent craft union movement seen in Hollywood to that time. The
communists, as has been acknowledged by current leaders of the
unions, were responsible for leading the battles that finally
organized honest independent unions of writers, directors and actors.
The first presidents of the Writers Guild were John Howard Lawson and
Lester Cole, both communists.</TE>
<TE>   In my first screenwriting job after having been fired from
Paramount when I was named as a "communist sympathizer" during the
infamous HUAC hearings in Washington in 1947, I tried to follow the
"party line" and get a job, any job at all, for a black actor. I
wrote in a taxi driver who was black. This was immediately crossed
out by the producer, who also had "line" to follow. He said it would
only make problems, exhibiting the film in the South.</TE>
<TE>   Lawson wrote the script for "Sahara," the only World War II film
to feature a courageous and heroic black soldier, played by Rex
Ingram. He also wrote "Action in the North Atlantic," which was the
first and only war film that emphasized the ordinary servicemen,
working men, who were under attack by the German submarines, not the
usual story focused on the officers. "Crossfire," produced by a
communist, Adrian Scott, was the first film to deal with
anti-Semitism in the U.S. Army. I could go on with dozens of examples
of films good and not so good, including some of mine, where
communists wrote or directed or produced films that made an earnest
effort to deal with serious social issues, not revolution.</TE>
<TE>   All this is not to say, as Schickel so sneeringly insists, that
the book under review insists that communists were the only ones
aiming to get worthwhile social content into films. But communists
were actively trying to use the medium to improve social conditions;
they did succeed on and off the screen in winning some battles. We
were not totally ineffectual, as Schickel would have it; nor were we
subversive, as J. Edgar Hoover had it. Actually, whatever our
mistakes and shortcomings, we were people who had a keen sense of
what was wrong in the world in terms of racism, poverty and war. We
quite naturally brought this kind of concern for the human condition
to our writing and filmmaking. Of course, speaking up for the rights
of the oppressed, for the right of workers to organize, against the
evils of unnecessary poverty and for peace and for a world not
organized solely in the interests of multinational corporations was
considered then and is considered now a threat to domestic security
(pace J. Edgar Hoover and John Ashcroft). This may be the role of
troublemaking dissenters. Buhle and Wagner set out to prove that the
communists in Hollywood made a contribution, not to list every
worthwhile film ever made by anyone. I think they succeeded.</TE>

<TE>   To the editor:</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-one years ago, in a book review published in Film Comment,
Richard Schickel clearly stated his animosity against "the
revisionist new left line in Cold War historiography" and the effort
by young historians to accord "something close to heroic status" to
blacklisted movie people. In his review of "Radical Hollywood," he
demonstrated fidelity to those two articles of his faith. But no such
consistency is evident in Schickel's style. Whereas in the Film
Comment review he treated the author (who was not a new leftist) and
his thesis with respect, in the recent review he filled eight of the
14 paragraphs with denigration, ridicule and polemics.</TE>
<TE>   He refers to the authors' thesis as a "central perversity," to
their book as a "huge lie." His evidence? He lists eight social issue
movies of the 1930s (seven of which were not products of the left
and, hence, not within the authors' purview), which the authors
failed to discuss. The three paragraphs devoted to this list
represent the sum total of the review's substantive discussion of the
authors' thesis.</TE>
<TE>   To set the record straight, Buhle and Wagner are asking their
readers to take another look at pre-blacklist movies, through lenses
crafted by an understanding of the Hollywood left's commitment to
melding popular culture, their politics and (for some of them) their
Jewishness. The authors do not argue that social issues were the
exclusive domain of the left. They do insist, and they present
examples from hundreds of movies to prove it, that a significant
number of films containing social commentary were written or directed
by the left. Their conclusion that the left influenced movie-making
in Hollywood, and that its members intended to do so, is factually
well-grounded.</TE>
<TE>   The nature of the left's influence is, of course debatable, but
Schickel sidesteps that debate. The role movies, or any form of
popular culture, play in determining political or social
consciousness is arguable, but Schickel avoids it with his anti-new
left cant. The left might have been utterly wrongheaded in its
theorizing, but Schickel refuses to engage the authors' efforts to
demonstrate otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the reviewer's belief that "[t]he communist left produced
almost nothing but gasbags" proves that no book offering any positive
commentary on the Hollywood left can expect to receive fair treatment
in a Schickel review.</TE>

<TE>   Co-author,</TE>
<TE>   "The Inquisition in Hollywood"</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Richard Schickel replies:</TE>
<TE>   The book was titled "Radical Hollywood." I was trying to say that
there are many ways of being a radical, in Hollywood or anywhere
else, that do not entail membership in totalitarian organizations and
that a book so titled has an obligation to consider the socially
conscientious work of people who had no allegiance whatsoever to any
ideology. This book makes no such attempt (may I note,
parenthetically, for Larry Ceplair's sake, that the list I compiled
of the movies Buhl and Wagner ignored was obviously intended to be
exemplary, not exhaustive). Beyond that, the world is as assiduous as
any of the reprehensible keepers of blacklists in sweeping "fellow
travelers" into the Stalinist orbit (whether they belong there or
not) and, worst of all, it falls for the biggest of the many
communist lies (repeated by Bernard Gordon)--that they were mere
"liberals" and "dissenters," American "innocents," taking the fall
for the rest of the American left, who would inevitably be the next
victims of native fascism. This, of course, was not true--though the
communist tactic of silence about their political allegiance was as
responsible for the evils of the blacklist as the HUAC hearings were.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, this book and its defenders leave out of their account
the fact that Hollywood communists were inevitably apologists for an
appalling evil--Stalinism--the crimes of which far exceeded, in the
sheer number of its victims, the crimes of Hitler. They also leave
out of the account the kind of popular front crud John Howard Lawson
perpetrated in the screenplays Gordon refers to. If his banal and
essentially anti-humane writing won no converts to his cause, it did
surely lower the tone of American political discussion in a crucial
period. That would be true of almost everything written by the
communists in the '30s and '40s.</TE>
<TE>   There has always been in this country an anti-communist left. I
have been an adherent of it all my adult life, during which time I
have grown increasingly outraged by the unexamined piety which has
raised Stalin's old party hacks to heroic status in Hollywood
history. It is communism's only lasting victory in the court of
public opinion, but it is one liberals, in particular, must begin to
question.</TE>

<HD>Starting Over</HD>
<DH>LOST NATION: A Novel, By Jeffrey Lent, Atlantic Monthly
Press: 370 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK OWCHAR</AU>
<BD>Nick Owchar is an assistant editor of Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In early 19th century America, there were plenty of places where a
person could start over or simply find a place to hide. The wide-open
prairies and deserts of the West beckoned, but for a New Englander
like Blood, the troubled main character in Jeffrey Lent's "Lost
Nation," the West is too far away and too much trouble to reach.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, he points his oxcart toward the deep woods of northern
New Hampshire and, as the axles and wheels crack and splinter on the
bad roads, the novel opens with the image of his escape:</LD>
<LD>   "They went on. The man Blood in hobnailed boots and rotting
leather breeches ... staggering at the canted shoulder of the near
ox, the girl behind barefoot in a rough shift of the same linen as
Blood's shirt ... her face swollen from the insect delirium that her
free hand swiped against, an unceasing ineffectual bat about her
head. Her other wrist cinched by a length of the same stripped
cowhide tethering her to the rear of the lurching groaning cart ...."</LD>
<TE>   The girl on a leash is Sally, a teenager Blood won in a card game;
his big ferocious dog, Luther, trots freely along; the cart is loaded
with rum and gunpowder he expects to trade--along with Sally's
services--when they arrive at Indian Stream, an unsettled region
inviting all manner of trappers, farmers and anti-government types
who've set up their own informal principality. There Blood hopes to
settle, to perhaps wrestle with the demons that drove him from his
family and respectable career so many years ago. And Sally, somehow,
is to play a role in this new life.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was a perverse god who had brought her to him," he thinks,
"he knew also that he was his own agent, he had some way sought her
...."</TE>
<TE>   Setting up a tavern and a one-woman brothel, Blood is one of two
centers of power in the small community. The other is the mill owner
Emil Chase, who holds debts to every settler there except Blood.
Sally's presence is welcome to the men but not to their wives. She
looks on their situation with an attitude that seems older than her
years.</TE>
<TE>   "I never had no father and ain't looking for one," she tells
Blood. "We're in business together is how I see it--even if there was
somewhere to go I wouldn't run off on you, you're the sort would hunt
me down and cut me up."</TE>
<TE>   How Sally moves from leash to partnership with Blood is the major
narrative focus of "Lost Nation." Having lived in a Maine brothel
before Blood's arrival, Sally enjoys a certain freedom with him. They
build a small fortune from the tavern, from fur trading and from
Sally, who's as privileged in her selection of clients as a
Renaissance courtesan. Blood softens toward her, alternating as
teacher and business partner, with obvious benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "That fearsome thing you got about you," she tells him, "it just
rolls right off up against me, don't it?"</TE>
<TE>   As Blood's tenderness for Sally grows, so do her shrewdness and
calculations. A first taste of freedom, after all, only whets her
appetite for more. Believing that Blood treats her better only to
make "amends for a fester tracked back to before she was even born,"
she waits to be free of him. She decides "to pay attention to what
was passing around her and watch for that opening, wherever, in
whatever form it might take." The trick, she thinks, is to be
patient.</TE>
<TE>   As Sally waits, Lent depicts the difficult violent circumstances
of life on the frontier and an ominous series of clashes with
Canadian and American magistrates, who vie for the disputed
territory. The author of the much-admired novel "In the Fall," Lent
is a skillful and confident storyteller, evoking the seasons, the
dampness of the bogs and the muck and the madness that sometimes
affects those living alone in the dark woods.</TE>
<TE>   As an adventure tale, "Lost Nation" is an enjoyable diversion,
like any historical movie in which Mel Gibson dons a costume. But the
secret history of Blood is less well-treated. Lent relates a
harrowing domestic tragedy that drove Blood into exile. Each time
these memories haunt him, however, Blood turns away to confront Chase
or a New Hampshire sheriff or to prepare for the coming winter. Blood
may not be inclined to reflection, but that hardly makes for a
satisfying story. Even when his two sons arrive, seeking explanations
(and challenging each other for the love of Sally, who sees them as
her chance), their necessary conversations seem wooden and forced.</TE>
<TE>   Near the novel's end, a final revelation that neatly answers some
questions about Blood's guilt feels like the deus ex machina of Greek
tragedy, adding to a sense that parts of the story are rather
contrived. In fact, "Lost Nation" has a Greek feel to it, from
Blood's role as an Oedipus-like outcast to a final conflagration. But
these aspects of the novel are ultimately less interesting than the
moments when people stop talking and rifles start firing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `Lost Nation'</TE>
<TE>   Much later. A tin pitcher of rum on the table now and a bucket of
water with the dipper tilted across the top. A pair of new logs on
the fire and the candle had consumed itself. Outside, Luther had
bayed once and that was all. She sat cross-legged on the table with
her skirt pulled down over her knees. Just room for their cups
between them.</TE>
<TE>   "They say you killed your wife."</TE>
<TE>   "Is that all they say?"</TE>
<TE>   "No."</TE>
<TE>   "I told you not to pester me with what you heard."</TE>
<TE>   "I know."</TE>
<TE>   They were quiet. Both drank. The firelight was grown liquid,
runnels lapping and receding as the logs settled and seethed.</TE>
<TE>   "She died," he said. "In an accident."</TE>
<TE>   "A long time ago."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," he said. "It would seem so to you."</TE>
<TE>   "Not to you."</TE>
<TE>   "No."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry."</TE>
<TE>   "Don't you be feeling sorry for me."</TE>

<LD>TRESPASS</LD>
<LD>   By Grace Dane Mazur</LD>
<LD>   Graywolf Press: 300 pp., $14.95</LD>
<TE>   I am reminded that the novel was originally a racy diversion for
ladies, based invariably on the many entanglements of love.
"Trespass" is a story of a stranger who wanders into a town and
captures the hearts of many of its women. He has walked away from his
marriage to find himself. He has become homeless, relying on the
kindness of strangers to feed and shelter him. He has wandered into
the home of Maggie and Hugh. Hugh is off sailing; Maggie is expecting
her cousin Jake for dinner. Jake has been in love with Maggie since
they were children but makes do with Sally. In his frustration over
his own unspoken love for Maggie, Jake sleeps with Maggie's grown
daughter, Gillian. Sally finds them. Maggie falls in love with the
stranger (who sleeps with all of the aforementioned women). With each
character, there is a back story, something that is impossible to
portray in a painting or a play or even a poem. There are depth,
description, context and landscape.</TE>
<TE>   The novel may be the only form that can do justice to the many
complexities of love as conundrum. Grace Dane Mazur picks her way
through the thicket of her own making with a remarkable lack of
superficiality or sentimentality. One would almost be tempted, if the
characters were not quite so unhinged, to take it all seriously.</TE>

<TE>   PLAIN STYLE</TE>
<TE>   A Guide to Written English</TE>
<TE>   By Christopher Lasch</TE>
<TE>   University of Pennsylvania Press:</TE>
<TE>   152 pp., $14.95</TE>
<TE>   The title alone--"Plain Style"--is intimidating. Puritanical but
also populist; simple but elegant. Christopher Lasch, who died in
1994 at 62, wrote this little guide in 1985 for his graduate students
at the University of Rochester in New York. The author of "The
Culture of Narcissism" and "The New Radicalism in America" could
hardly be expected to check his politics at the door. When a rule is
broken or a convolution renders meaning unintelligible, he insults
the writer, calls the error "bureaucratic," as if it were used by
bureaucrats to enhance their self-importance and therefore is unfit
for print. "In accordance with the principle that good writing must
always oppose the bureaucratic debasement of language, it is a good
idea, wherever possible, to refer to the names of governmental
agencies, voluntary associations, and other organizations by their
full names, not by their initials." Other criminal offenses in
Lasch's view are academic writing and the use of jargon: a
"'mischievous impulse' among eggheads," he writes, quoting Russell
Baker. But the real sins in Lasch's congregation are ambiguous
antecedents, split infinitives and dangling modifiers, as well as
such misused words as "affect," "an," "complement" and "enthuse."
Most helpful is the section on how to write an essay: dive right into
your subject in the very first paragraph. Explain what you mean in
the second. Avoid the "poverty of verbs" and the use of too many
adjectives and nouns. Respect the serial comma. "Try to arrange
sentences so that the most important words or ideas come at the end."
Avoid the passive voice: Its anonymity "endears it to bureaucrats,
who wish to avoid responsibility for their decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Lack of clarity, obfuscation, tangled syntax are political; this
is the subtext of "Plain Style." And Lasch's derision makes "Plain
Style" a pleasure to read, the true test of good grammar.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   OUT THERE</TE>
<TE>   Mavericks of Black Literature</TE>
<TE>   By Darryl Pinckney</TE>
<TE>   Basic Civitas Books: 176 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   "Out There" is a collection of three lectures given by Darryl
Pinckney at Harvard and covers three works of nonfiction by black
men: J.A. Rogers' "Sex and Race," Vincent O. Carter's "The Bern Book"
and Caryl Phillips' "The Atlantic Sound." They were chosen more for
the heft and vision of their ideas than for their writing. In his
three-volume work, "Sex and Race," Rogers writes that there is no
such thing as a pure white race; the West, he writes, is "all mongrel
societies." The book is, Pinckney says, "a survey of retribution, a
study in trying to beat the white man at his own ideological game."
Carter's "The Bern Book" is the "diary of an isolated soul," a
personal story of Carter's dream of cultural assimilation in Europe.
"The Atlantic Sound" by Phillips takes on what Pinckney calls "the
pieties of spiritual return to Africa." "Africa is not a cure," he
paraphrases Phillips. "Africa is not a psychiatrist."</TE>
<TE>   Taken together these three books do seem to form a triptych of
mirrors in black literature. The lectures make graceful essays, and
Pinckney's observant, elegant writing places Rogers', Carter's and
Phillips' works indelibly in the canon.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Beauty is sometimes thought to be skin-deep, but glamour is not even
that: It's applied to the surface of the body in the forms of makeup,
coiffure and clothing. It's a kind of sexual glow or haze, an aura
that surrounds an expensive and well-crafted presentation of the self
as a sex object. Rarely has anyone understood and presented glamour
as perfectly as the pinup artist Rolf Armstrong, whose calendars,
posters and product packaging were popular from the teens to the '50s
of the 20th century.</LD>
<LD>   Though the text of "Pin-Up Dreams: The Glamour Art of Rolf
Armstrong," by Janet Dobson and Michael Wooldridge, is fairly
pedestrian biography, the images are absorbing, especially the many
photographs of models posing in Armstrong's studio paired with the
resulting painting. This allows us to see a pretty girl--for example,
Armstrong's longtime muse, the aptly named Jewel Flowers--translated
into a perfect target of desire. Though most of the models are
clothed, the presentation of the breasts is always key: Armstrong's
art provides glowing altarpieces of the cult of breast.</LD>
<LD>   But perhaps the most important feature is something a bit more
elusive: In every single image we get the sense that the model is
enjoying, indeed reveling in, her sexual self-presentation. In our
post-feminist era, that may be politically problematic, but it
remains devastating in its erotic effectiveness.</LD>
<TE>   Surely pretty women, among other folks, know that it can be a
pleasure and a power to be looked at. And Armstrong was able to give
women this power: They seem to be enjoying themselves no less in the
studio photos than in the pinups themselves. Our absorption in the
image is in part a reaction to the model's absorption in her
self-provision.</TE>
<TE>   A motif in this book, classic at least since Velazquez, is the
image of a woman gazing at herself in a mirror. We are looking at her
looking at herself; we are meant to enjoy looking at her looking at
herself. Her glamour is something she makes for herself and that we
happen to see, as if it were by chance, though of course the whole
activity depends on the desire of the man who is stipulated as
watching. This embedded series of erotic experiences is enacted as
intensely in Armstrong's art as anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   The art of pinup as employed, for example, by soldiers during
World War II as an emblem of heterosexuality has gained in erotic
allure in the intervening years. An innocence surrounds this material
that, one suspects, was absent at the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   In a world saturated with pornography and with near-pornographic
images of the sort available in the latest Jennifer Lopez video, the
eroticism of Armstrong's work is saturated both in sweetness and in
nostalgia. And, Lord, the man could draw.</TE>

<DH>THE EMPEROR OF OCEAN PARK, A Novel, By Stephen L. Carter,
Alfred A. Knopf:  672 pp., $26.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN SHAPIRO</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Shapiro is a writer for the television drama
"The Practice." A former federal prosecutor, he is an adjunct law
professor at USC.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Law professor Talcott Garland is the privileged son of legendary
attorney and Republican stalwart Oliver Garland. Well papered and
connected, the Garlands are so established a family that when they
summer at their home on Martha's Vineyard, they try to avoid the
Kennedys.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the nation's aristocracy, important people given over
to public service and profitable private enterprise, they glide along
the "Cambridge-Washington axis" through prestigious universities, law
firms, investment banks and government posts. They seem fated to do
stimulating work and lead purposeful, perfect lives.</LD>
<LD>   But the Garlands are not what they appear. Much that is impressive
is facade. Much of the noble public service reflects a secret need to
compensate for private failings, and when Oliver dies under
mysterious circumstances, Talcott is no longer able to deny what he
has long feared: His family's power and prestige have come at an
awful price.</LD>
<TE>   Stephen L. Carter's "The Emperor of Ocean Park" is a remarkable
debut novel. A member of the Yale Law School faculty for more than 20
years, Carter has written a number of scholarly works, none of which
hinted at his gift for fiction. "The Emperor" is so rich in detail
about a particular segment of American society that it only could
have been written with unusual access to the subject and by someone
with extraordinary powers of observation and expression. Carter has
both.</TE>
<TE>   The maxim that every great family fortune is built on a great
crime fails to describe the Garlands. They are both victims and
perpetrators of many crimes. When Talcott's younger sister is killed
by a hit-and-run driver, the autocratic Oliver compounds the tragedy
by refusing to acknowledge embarrassing aspects of his daughter's
personal life or the family's potential culpability in her demise.
That obfuscation of justice protects the Garland name.</TE>
<TE>   Oliver goes on to be appointed to the federal bench, but his
stellar career is cut short when his nomination to the Supreme Court
unravels in unseemly controversy.</TE>
<TE>   For Talcott, the pressure to live up to his father's enormous
expectations and contradictions leaves him emotionally numb and
professionally impotent. He remains married to an unfaithful,
ambitious wife for the same reason he continues to slog along in an
unsatisfying academic career: He is afraid to do anything else.
Oliver's death, however, jolts Talcott into action.</TE>
<TE>   Now for the clincher: The Garlands are black. This might surprise
you. That I mention it might offend you. That race is relevant and
indeed fundamental to the book is undeniable.</TE>
<TE>   "Ours is an old family, which, among people of our color, is a
reference less to social than to legal status. Ancestors of ours were
free and earning a living when members of the darker nation were in
chains. Not all our ancestors were free, of course, but some, and the
family does not dwell on the others: we have buried that bit of
historical memory as effectively as the rest of America has buried
the larger crime. And, like good Americans, we not only forgive the
crime of chattel slavery but celebrate the criminals."</TE>
<TE>   In "The Emperor of Ocean Park," Carter, who is also black,
provides a rare look into the world of wealthy and established black
families, their attitudes toward their history and their feelings
about their fellow Americans. One is at a loss to name another book,
movie, television program or other work of popular culture that has
sought to convey, with such clarity, such depth of understanding or
such critical analysis, the uniqueness of this experience.</TE>
<TE>   Talcott Garland is revealed as the other Invisible Man, the
successful, accepted black man whose pain is more existential than
racial, though the two are never far apart. It is a pain not born of
poverty or racism but rather survivor's guilt over his achievement in
avoiding the harshest impact of both.</TE>
<TE>   This guilt, made acute as the Garlands rise to become part of the
American elite, carries with it an especially heavy burden, one that
smacks, to Talcott, of collaboration with the oppressors, self-hatred
and tokenism. Because of his success, not in spite of it, he is
isolated and uncomfortable in his own skin. He is a slave to the
demands placed on him by being a Garland, deprived of even the succor
of faith and shared suffering available to less successful blacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I pass a gaggle of beggars, all members of the darker nation, to
each of whom I give a dollar--paying guilt money, [my wife] calls
this habit of mine. I wonder, briefly, how many of them are hustlers,
but this is what my father used to call an 'unworthy thought': You
are better than such ideas, he would preach to his children, with
rare anger, commanding us to patrol our minds."</TE>
<TE>   Part mystery, part social commentary, Carter's book is full of wry
observation on matters ranging from the backbiting world of law
school faculties to the nature of family squabbles and the social
distinctions within the higher strata of black society. Some moments
are more successful than others. Talcott's wife and her pending
judicial nomination too often seem a distraction. Carter's reliance
on chess, specifically Oliver's obsession with it and Talcott's
application of its more obscure strategies to solve the mystery of
his father's death, seem obscure and forced.</TE>
<TE>   But as with all serious literature, "The Emperor of Ocean Park"
grounds its most important relationship in truths that transcend
matters of race. As father and son, Oliver and Talcott are men of
intellect and means, sharing all the competitive, repressed,
contradictory and fierce emotions that that relationship suggests.
Here, the color of skin is less significant than the American-ness
that defines their aspirations and disappointments. Theirs is a
relationship forged less in the welter of racism than in the mill of
the Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism.</TE>
<TE>   Like John Cheever and Philip Roth, Carter confirms that above a
certain tax bracket, race or religion does not make Americans crazy.
Money, advancement, prestige and power do--and the need to own and
possess in a society where nothing is free, not even ambition, not
even a father's love, and Carter is wise enough to define his book on
these terms, above all others.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `The Emperor of Ocean Park'</TE>
<TE>   When my father finally died, he left the Redskins tickets to my
brother, the house on Shepard Street to my sister, and the house on
the Vineyard to me. ...</TE>
<TE>   I was glad to have the Vineyard house, a tidy little Victorian on
Ocean Park in the town of Oak Bluffs, with lots of frilly carpenter's
Gothic along the sagging porch and a lovely morning view of the white
band shell set amidst a vast sea of smooth green grass and outlined
against a vaster sea of bright blue water. My parents like to tell
how they bought the house for a song back in the sixties, when
Martha's Vineyard, and the black middle-class colony that summers
there, were still smart and secret. Lately, in my father's
oft-repeated view, the Vineyard had tumbled downhill, for it was
crowded and noisy and, besides, they let everyone in now, by which he
meant black people less well off than we. ...</TE>
<TE>   And yet, amidst all the clamor, the Vineyard house is a small
marvel. I loved it as a child and love it more now. Every room, every
dark wooden stair, every window whispers its secret share of
memories. ...</TE>
<TE>   Ah, the Vineyard house! Addison was married in it, twice, once
more or less successfully, and I smashed the leaded glass in the
double front door, also twice, once more or less intentionally. Every
summer of my youth we went there to live, because that is what one
does with a summer home. Every winter my father griped about the
upkeep and threatened to sell it, because that is what one does when
happiness is a questionable investment. And when the cancer that
pursued her for six years finally won, my mother died in it, in the
smallest bedroom, with the nicest view of Nantucket Sound, because
that is what one does if one can choose one's end.</TE>
<TE>   My father died at his desk. And, at first, only my sister and a
few stoned callers to late-night radio shows believed he had been
murdered.</TE>

<HD>Three Questions for Hortense Calisher</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SALTER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: How did you research your novel?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: For a writer like me, and my ilk, you live your life,
listen to the world and look. For the novel "Mysteries of Motion"
about six civilians on a spaceship, I did read up on NASA and had a
line drawing of the vehicle and the names of its parts. The rest?
Imagination. The science editor of the New York Times said he
couldn't fault it. I trust to luck. Research would kill it.</LD>
<LD>   Q: Among New York's many status symbols, what are your personal
favorites?</LD>
<TE>   A: I collect shoes and have some marvels, but they are to admire
and wear. Most artists would locate their symbols of greatness in the
arts. New York has that in all directions. And "status" in general is
shifting here, always. It is laughed at too, if it is rigid. But if
you press me, well, I like the Hudson River on which I have often
lived. And the lions--at the New York Public Library.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Were you trying to paint an accurate portrait of
upper-middle-class Jews in New York?</TE>
<TE>   A: No. In "The New Yorkers," which has both rich and poor, I did
have a lot to say about the "middle." "Sunday Jews" portrays a sector
of the "assimilated." Though it is not about my family, I and mine
have been that, and in this nation, for a long time. Yet we still are
Jews, I altogether, some of us in part. My father used to read the
Hebrew lessons in a Virginian drawl. I used to wonder how he could be
so proudly Jewish and Southern at the same time. "Sunday Jews"
contains many reflections on just that: proud assimilation--without
orthodoxy (as E.M. Forster said: Only Connect).</TE>

<DH>MAN WALKS INTO A ROOM, A Novel, By Nicole Krauss, Nan A.
Talese / Doubleday: 256 pp., $23.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF TURRENTINE</AU>
<BD>Jeff Turrentine is a senior editor with Hemispheres
magazine and has written for the New York Times Magazine and
Slate.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the short story, "Funes, His Memory," Jorge Luis Borges creates a
character, Funes, who has somehow managed to inoculate himself
against the ravages of forgetfulness. Thrown from a horse, Funes is
knocked unconscious, and--in a sly inversion of the classic amnesia
story--awakens to discover not that he's suddenly "missing" weeks or
months or years of his life but that he has been granted total
recall. Whatever Funes perceives, he retains: from entire Latin texts
to the patterns of spray formed by an oar being lifted from the
water. What's more, he's able to swim confidently in the flood of
associations these memories inevitably release: Everything reminds
him of something else, which in turn reminds him of something else.
His body crippled from the fall, he is transformed into a being of
pure, perfect mind.</LD>
<LD>   Borges, the librarian-fabulist, was fascinated with our private
modes of cataloging information and the role memory plays in our
construction of reality. In Funes' story, we sense a sad
acknowledgment of memory's limitations, of its susceptibility to
decay. At the same time, Borges suggests that forgetfulness--which
Funes is doomed never to know--is also a supreme blessing: our only
means of calibrating the onslaught of our experience and managing its
terrible weight. His ultimate moral: We are all amnesiacs, and we
should all be grateful for it.</LD>
<TE>   High-diving gamely into the pool of amnesia literature is Nicole
Krauss, whose debut novel, "Man Walks Into a Room," is a startling
tale of a man so desperate for memories that he is willing to borrow
someone else's.</TE>
<TE>   The amnesiac owes his unique place in our fictions to our
curiosity about memory's relationship to identity and to tantalizing
questions about existential culpability: Are we anything more than
walking, talking accretions of empirical data? Are we morally
responsible for acts we don't remember committing? Playing around
with the tropes of amnesia allows a writer to remove a character's
overstuffed personal filing cabinet and see if there's anything like
an actual soul hiding behind it. It's a device that must tempt every
novelist, though the rules of verisimilitude (the condition is
actually extremely rare) have frightened many of them off and
effectively pushed these stories to the fringes of genre fiction.
Krauss, however, isn't intimidated, and her novel is as clever and
poignant as it is fearless.</TE>
<TE>   "Man Walks Into a Room" begins as noir, detours into an
Updike-like study of a doomed marriage, then veers off toward
paranoid sci-fi before entering the home stretch as a mournful
kaddish. Samson Greene, a professor of English at Columbia
University, is found wandering the deserts outside of Las Vegas,
unkempt, dehydrated and unable to explain who he is or how he got
there. When his wife, Anna, is summoned from New York to retrieve
him, she's greeted with the news that a cherry-sized tumor has
impinged on Samson's temporal lobe and resulted in an unusually
severe case of amnesia. An emergency operation to remove the tumor is
a qualified success: The patient's life is saved, but his memory from
the age of 12 to the time of the operation isn't. Suddenly the
36-year-old Samson is missing 24 years. He knows the names and faces
of his grade-school playmates, takes comfort in memories of his
childhood dog and his beloved mother, but he doesn't recognize his
wife.</TE>
<TE>   Upon returning to New York, Samson begins to fall apart despite
Anna's loving ministrations. His apartment and the surrounding city
are completely unfamiliar to him. He has no friends. He can't teach
anymore. He can't remember the thousands of books he has read, the
classes he has led, or--most disturbing--the life he has built over a
decade with Anna. As the gulf between them widens, Samson finds
himself drifting toward a former student, a young woman whose humor
and vitality make him feel temporarily normal but whose coyness about
their history together makes him wonder whether they were more than
just teacher and pupil.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after he and Anna separate, Samson receives a call from a
neurologist conducting mnemonic research in Nevada who's
understandably fascinated by this most unusual case. Unsettled and
unmoored, Samson is vulnerable to an offer by the neurologist to go
to the desert, where he would have another person's single digitized
memory implanted into the tabula rasa of his consciousness. Feeling
that he has nothing to lose and eager for the paycheck and the
opportunity to participate in envelope-pushing science, Samson agrees
to take part in the experiment and makes the journey out West.</TE>
<TE>   First novels rarely venture beyond the safety zones designated for
the supervised play of their young writers: gauzy coming-of-age
sagas, gothically tinged campus dramas, comic diaries of romantic
mishap in the big city. Instead of just another variation on a
cookie-cutter theme, Krauss has crafted a mysterious and compelling
tale that doesn't settle for easy insights or the usual rechauffe of
stock characters and predictable twists. "Man Walks Into a Room" has
the pleasantly puzzling abstruseness of a book like Paul Auster's
"Moon Palace" (a novel with which it shares much, including the
striking image of a lost man, reduced to a state of nature,
journeying through the Western desert in an attempt to connect with
his past). Krauss may still be several books away from matching
Auster's genius for metaphorical seamlessness--for making every
symbol seem urgent and necessary, like secret code--but you can see
her aiming for it, and her story is filled with plenty of strange and
wonderful moments.</TE>
<TE>   With poems published in the Paris Review, among other journals,
Krauss brings to her work a poet's gift for seizing upon small but
potent details. A senile character, Samson's uncle, who still refers
to his long-dead wife as though she were alive and well, is said to
be "lost in the twilight of the present tense." The chasm between the
estranged Samson and Anna is mapped in an awkward long-distance phone
call marked by the "vast, pin-dropping silence that only fiber optics
can achieve."</TE>
<TE>   When the experiment in the desert leaves Samson with a memory he'd
be more than happy to lose, he finds to his horror that he can't
forget. In his forlorn state he follows the one and only sense he
still trusts--instinct--which leads him to Northern California and
the final resting place of his mother, the last person he can
remember loving. By this point, Krauss has already unearthed--through
the story of Samson and Anna--love's deep and tangled roots in the
soil of memory, and she suggests that the forgetfulness of heartbreak
allows us to experience again and again the ecstasy of love,
affirming Borges' notion of amnesia as a merciful agent. "Man Walks
Into a Room" is swirling with curious ideas and enticing paradoxes.
Krauss has written a novel that, unto itself, is hard to forget.</TE>

<LD>And with it, comes the prospect of vacation and the promise of
tackling the books we had hoped to read (but never got around to) and
immersing ourselves in the titles now flooding bookstores. Why this
season is considered best for reading is more a Manhattan publishers'
conceit than a Southern California reader's reality. After all, the
sun shines on us all year, and people read everything--fiction,
nonfiction, poetry--without regard to season.</LD>

riches on offer this summer are a number of titles that stand out. We
begin with a quartet of novels: two by promising newcomers, Nicole
Krauss' "Man Walks Into a Room" and Stephen L. Carter's "The Emperor
of Ocean Park," and two by veteran writers, Hortense Calisher's
"Sunday Jews" and Ward Just's "The Weather in Berlin." We also have
tossed in the excitements of Rolf Armstrong's pinup art and
Alessandro Boffa's curiosity, "You're an Animal, Viskovitz!"</LD>
<LD>   Our approach is not comprehensive. We intend only to pique your
interest and to urge you to explore the numerous bookstores
throughout Southern California. For many of us, that's the best
vacation around.</LD>

<HD>Careers Rewritten in German</HD>
<DH>The ironies aren't lost on these Americans. Considered
dinosaurs at home, they've found new life coming up with scripts for
dramedies they can understand only with the help of subtitles.</DH>

<LD>Art's Deli in Studio City is where you can often find, at midmorning
on an otherwise unremarkable Tuesday or Wednesday, television comedy
writers with free time. They are middle-aged or older and still
funny, even if they have been forced into a particular kind of
Hollywood exile, their lives settled in the comfortable San Fernando
Valley hamlets of Encino, Sherman Oaks and Studio City.</LD>
<LD>   Lenny Ripps moved to Los Angeles in 1976 from Baltimore, after
breaking into the business selling jokes to Joan Rivers. In the
writers' rooms on sitcoms like "Bosom Buddies" and "Full House,"
Ripps, a friendly, roundish man you want to adopt as an uncle, earned
a reputation as a tummler: Yiddish for someone who makes a lot of
noise. And why not? He was, he reasoned, in the quantity
business--pitching 50, 100 jokes a day, bad one-liners after good
ones, all building what Ripps calls "the road" to the joke that would
end up in the script.</LD>
<LD>   Ripps did this, even though he stutters, an impairment that has
abated since he was a child. "I made myself faster than anyone else,"
he says of competing for laughs in the room. "So even with the
stutter I'd beat them."</LD>
<TE>   Because he can't stop himself, Ripps has jokes for the work he
does now, as a Jew writing for German television.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't pay taxes, because I list it as reparations," goes one.</TE>
<TE>   In a subterranean world that seems lifted from a Coen Brothers
movie, a loose collection of "older," and mostly Jewish, sitcom
writers is working for German television. The series are not called
"Will &amp; Grace" or "The Bernie Mac Show"; they are called "Ritas
Welt," "Nikola," "Alles Atze" and "Mein Leben &amp; Ich." The writers
speak by phone regularly with an excitable German TV producer whose
nickname in German is "Seni," which sounds like "Zany." He is 42, a
former musician and psychiatrist. His real name is Christian Munder.</TE>
<TE>   Script drafts fly back and forth over the Internet, the writers
e-mailing from their San Fernando Valley homes and Seni in Cologne,
where he oversees production of a Friday night block of sitcoms that
air on the commercial German television network RTL.</TE>
<TE>   A few times a year, Seni travels to Los Angeles for meetings with
writers. He stays at the Chateau Marmont on the Sunset Strip. He
could stay at a ritzier place, at a Four Seasons, but the Marmont,
with its old Hollywood elegance and new Hollywood crowd, better suits
the aesthetics of a Cologne sophisticate.</TE>
<TE>   In turn, the writers find Seni amusing, trustworthy and
smart--refreshingly unlike a network executive.</TE>
<TE>   This is, evidently, one of the unexpected byproducts of a global
electronic village: You can be 53-year-old Lenny Ripps or 58-year-old
Ed Scharlach or 58-year-old Paula Roth, and still matter, creatively,
by entertaining German television viewers.</TE>
<TE>   To call the shows sitcoms is a tad misleading, because it suggests
that Ripps and Roth have to know how to craft a joke, or a story, in
German. In fact, they don't speak the language, and the shows, shot
on film without laugh tracks, play less like sitcoms than dramedies,
the laughs more situational than joke-driven.</TE>
<TE>   "I do try to stay away from very quick patter, because the German
language does not lend itself to quick back-and-forth repartee," Roth
said. "Their nouns tend to be descriptive of what the object does."</TE>
<TE>   Roth helped create "Mein Leben &amp; Ich" (Me and My Life), a new
series about a cynical, brooding teenage girl named Alex. In a former
life, Roth wrote for "Laverne &amp; Shirley," "Happy Days" and "Perfect
Strangers." Then she turned 50, and things changed. "Suddenly there I
was, a 51-year-old writer who had not worked on a hit show for a
year, who had an unsold pilot, and I looked behind me and there were
a whole lot of other writers waiting to take my spot."</TE>
<TE>   Like Ripps, Roth recognizes that being unwanted in Hollywood but
wanted in Germany is a bizarre twist on a 20th century
phenomenon--Jews fleeing anti-Semitism in Europe and reinventing
themselves in Hollywood as purveyors of mass entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Ripps isn't a son of Holocaust victims, but he is the child of
Jewish parents who wouldn't, he remembers, buy anything made by
Krups, a German maker of small appliances. So there was a certain
unease about this new line of work. "I needed to acknowledge to them
that they're Germans and I know they're Germans," he said recently.
His colleagues in Cologne, Ripps said, expressed horror and guilt
about an event that occurred before they were born.</TE>
<TE>   He needed to hear the guilt expressed. "As long as they have
that," Ripps said, "I'm happy."</TE>
<TE>   "Nikola," set in a Cologne hospital, centers on the romantic and
professional tensions between a nurse and a high-handed surgeon. "
Welt" (Rita's World) stars comedian Gaby Koster as a supermarket
checkout clerk. "Alles Atze" (Always Atze) stars Atze Schroder as a
brazen store owner in the German city of Essen-Kray. He has a Turkish
sidekick.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Columbia TriStar International Television, the
Sony-owned entity that produces the German comedies airing on RTL,
threw a party at the Chateau Marmont for the 15 or so writers
involved in the shows. "Many of the writers, even though they live in
the same town and belong to the same union, hadn't seen each other in
15 years," said John Barber, a consultant at Columbia TriStar who has
been integral in establishing the link between writers here and
production abroad. "I think a lot of them were surprised to see who
else was there and who else was doing this."</TE>
<TE>   For Roth, it began with a call from her agent, suggesting she go
to the Chateau Marmont to meet with some German producers. It sounded
odd, but it had been a while since she'd last worked. And it was
breakfast at the Chateau Marmont.</TE>
<TE>   By that time, Roth was paying her own health insurance, her
coverage through the Writers Guild of America having lapsed from lack
of recent work. She had downsized, selling the boat and the
5,000-square-foot house, behind gates in Encino, for a smaller
version of a still-comfortable life.</TE>
<TE>   Roth, who is from the Bronx, speaks with the matter-of-fact tone
of a New Yorker. When she got her first sitcom job, on "Laverne &amp;
Shirley," Roth says, she became valuable in the room because she'd
been a childhood friend of Penny Marshall and understood how to voice
Laverne.</TE>
<TE>   Roth's work on "Mein Leben" is covered by the WGA through
Columbia. She is not getting rich (per-script payments are about
$15,000). But penning two episodes means surpassing the $18,659
yearly that writers must earn to keep their WGA benefits active. More
significant to Roth, however, "Mein Leben" represents an unexpected
afterlife, a way to do meaningful work at a time when Hollywood might
consider her career over.</TE>
<TE>   "It was certainly not about economic need. It was about emotional
need," she said of that initial meeting. "The thing about this town
is, you are what you do. And the first question anyone says to you,
after 'Hi, how are you? You look great' is 'What are you doing?'"</TE>
<TE>   The work that found Roth is not unprecedented. In addition to five
comedies on RTL, Columbia, which has been more aggressive than other
domestic studios, produces dramas overseas as well.</TE>
<TE>   Mainly, though, studios have gone hesitantly into foreign
television, which lacks the advertising and syndication markets that
can generate hundreds of millions of dollars in the U.S. More often,
companies have tried to adapt their hit series for other cultures.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, when Columbia and RTL signed their three-year production
deal, they initially took two Columbia sitcom properties "Who's the
Boss?" (which had done well adapted in England) and "Married ... With
Children," and adapted the scripts and reshot the episodes for German
TV, mimicking the sets of the original shows.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't work, says Christiane Ruff, who at the time was an RTL
executive, because German audiences rejected what they saw as
reconstituted American TV.</TE>
<TE>   According to Scott Siegler, then head of Columbia Pictures
Television, "Who's the Boss?" ran into a number of production
troubles peculiar to German culture. Producers had trouble, for
instance, finding an actor to play the male housekeeper popularized
by Tony Danza because, Siegler said, German actors "didn't want to be
laughed at."</TE>
<TE>   Around this time, Barber and Ruff took the deal in a new
direction: They began to look at doing original scripts for German
TV, giving up on American sitcom hits as source material. They were
immediately encouraged when a pilot called "Die Campers" (The
Campers), set in a campground, was well-received. But while Barber
had discovered that you could hire set decorators and cameramen,
finding writers well-versed in the tricky math of telling a logical
and amusing story in 22 sitcom minutes was another matter.</TE>
<TE>   Writers in Germany, Ruff says, tend to work "at home, in their
ivory towers. Whereas in the States it's considered a job."</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't care what their status was over here," Barber said of
the American writers he sought, some of whom he knew from his ABC
days, "other than the fact that they were available and they liked
what we were doing and they were enthusiastic when we sat down and
talked to them about the shows. That was the criteria. I would have
worked with an 18-year-old guy or a 70-year-old guy."</TE>
<TE>   At their Sherman Oaks home recently, Ken Cinnamon and Karen
Wengrod, a husband-and-wife writing team who spent seven seasons
rising through the ranks on ABC's "Who's the Boss?," screened an
episode of "Nikola."</TE>
<TE>   The show, which recently completed production on a sixth season,
stars Mariele Millowitsch and Walter Sittler as Nikola and Dr.
Schmidt, respectively. In a country with fewer than a third of the
estimated 105 million television households in the U.S., "Nikola,"
which airs Friday nights at 9:15, after the still popular "Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire," has been averaging 6.6 million viewers of late,
giving it an audience share that in the States would be almost
"ER"-like.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a long learning curve involved," Wengrod said. "It takes
some time to develop the relationship and learn the thing. The
problem they had with some American writers was this attitude of
'I'll give you what I want, and you'll be grateful.'"</TE>
<TE>   Cinnamon says they watch episodes on the Internet; they also get
tapes, which sometimes have subtitles. And sometimes they don't. "We
know the story, we wrote it, but we have no idea what is being said,"
Cinnamon said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, for Cinnamon and Wengrod, "Nikola" arrived as an unusual
lifeline at a time when the broadcast networks were moving away from
family sitcoms. Already under contract at Columbia, they were asked
to create a show set in a German hospital, centering on a nurse and
single mother. Pioneers of this German experiment, they came up with
a light romantic comedy, accented on the German end with undertones
of class and workplace politics.</TE>
<TE>   "The early reviews said, 'Finally, a show that matches the German
sensibility,'" marveled Cinnamon.</TE>
<TE>   This chapter in their careers has been a crash course not only in
the vagaries of international production, but also in cultural
differences. If you're writing for German TV, for instance, the
Chinese delivery guy becomes the Turkish delivery guy. Nudity is not
verboten. Nikola's best friend is a gay transvestite, further
suggesting Germany's more open attitudes toward sex.</TE>
<TE>   In turn, Cinnamon and Wengrod are providing German writers with an
education in how to develop a situation comedy over a long run of
episodes.</TE>
<TE>   The two both script and assign episodes to other writers here,
including Scharlach and Paul Wolff. "Basically the show we're doing
is classic battle of the sexes," Wolff said. "The couple that loves
to hate each other. It kind of cuts across all lines." The more
culturally specific "Die Campers" and "Atze," by contrast, rely more
heavily on German writers.</TE>
<TE>   According to Ruff, who today is managing director and head of
creative affairs for Columbia TriStar International Television, the
shows employ about a dozen in-house writers in all. These writers,
Ruff said recently over coffee in the Chateau Marmont garden, do more
than translate the Americans' final drafts.</TE>
<TE>   "A translation would never be enough," she said. "We still would
have a script with an American feel."</TE>
<TE>   It was clear that she knew what this meant, even if it was
somewhat difficult to articulate. It had to do with culture, with the
school system, with dating rituals. It had to do with taking
something no one can build better than Americans--the situation
comedy--and adding one's own imprint.</TE>
<TE>   Last March, the man Paula Roth and Lenny Ripps and Ken Cinnamon
call "Zany" arrived in Los Angeles for story meetings on "Ritas
Welt," "Mein Leben," "Atze" and "Nikola."</TE>
<TE>   Munder, or Seni, or Zany, made the rounds of the writers he
normally deals with via e-mail and over the phone. With him were Mark
Werner, another RTL writer-producer, and Barber, Columbia's
go-between for what they hope is a budding empire of German
television shows.</TE>
<TE>   As the creative point man, on the German side, for the shows in
the RTL-Columbia arrangement, Munder has opinions about American
shows, likes and dislikes. Like Ruff, he loves "Seinfeld." But he
could do without "Friends."</TE>
<TE>   In the lobby of the Marmont, Roth showed up to go over another
season of "Mein Leben," and soon Ripps appeared. He kibitzed about
his trip to Florida to visit his parents. Then he and Seni went off
to another part of the lobby to talk about "Ritas Welt."</TE>
<TE>   By then, the lobby was filling up with people-in-black having
afternoon drinks. A pianist started to play. It felt like Hollywood,
where all the world is on the verge of signing a movie deal. In
truth, of course, all of Hollywood is just looking for work, an angle
to play. In truth, show business is a German nicknamed Zany, telling
you that when he was younger, he "really loved 'The Golden Girls.'"</TE>

<HD>Album of a Native American Past</HD>
<DH>In 'Jump Kiss,' Diane Glancy conveys memories, enhanced
with family photos, of her family life in 1950s Kansas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCARLET CHENG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Diane Glancy's new play, "Jump Kiss: An Indian Legend," the
characters recall pivotal experiences, introduce Native American
myths and ruminate on the ineffable--sometimes intertwining,
sometimes overlapping--in an often stream-of-consciousness manner. So
it's not surprising that the first question people might ask her is:
"What is it?"</LD>
<LD>   Even Glancy admits "it's such a collage of unrelated, almost
unrealized moments."</LD>
<LD>   Based loosely on Glancy's life, the play conveys a girl's memories
of growing up in Kansas in the 1950s, the daughter of an
English-German mother and a Cherokee father, and of later becoming a
mother herself. The fragmentary way the play is presented--an attempt
to replicate the scattered and unpredictable way memory works--may
confound some audiences, but the playwright believes there is a
payoff.</LD>
<TE>   "When you let it flow over you, when you see it in its totality,
there is something concrete there, there's a unity," says Glancy,
speaking by phone from St. Paul, Minn., where she teaches Native
American literature and creative writing at Macalester College.
"Something concrete comes in a very abstract way."</TE>
<TE>   "Jump Kiss" is the first play to be staged as part of the Native
Voices theater project at the Autry Museum of Western Heritage. The
program, launched in 2000, is designed to develop and present plays
by or about Native Americans. Three plays were workshopped in March
2001. "Jump Kiss," the first of the plays to be fully produced, will
receive its world premiere at the Autry's Wells Fargo Theatre on
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Glancy originally wrote the play for one voice, but during the
workshop process the parts were separated.</TE>
<TE>   "Jump Kiss" lacks a traditional plot line, and the narrator serves
not only as a guide and commentator, but also as a character taking
part in the action. Often the action helps clarify what's going on.
For example, when Mother, Father, Sister and Brother go for a car
ride, the four actors crouch down in two rows, one behind the other.
When one character says, "I hear the low, wild whine of the car and
house as we hump the farmroad," the family members jog up and down as
if tossed by a bump on the road. The sets are minimal--four chairs
and a table to suggest a kitchen--but during the play, three screens
project about 300 photographs, which include images of Glancy's
family, taken by the playwright's mother, Edith Wood Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I think, jokingly, I'm in the Jackson Pollock school of
drama, where you just dribble words here and there," Glancy says,
"and somehow if you stand back far enough, they connect, a kind of
surreal gathering of scenes."</TE>
<TE>   The task facing cast members, says director Randy Reinholz, was to
help the audience visualize Glancy's expressionistic language. A man
with a calm manner and boyish face, Reinholz, an assistant professor
of theater at San Diego State University, is of Choctaw descent.
Along with his wife, Jean Bruce Scott, he founded the Native Voices
Theatre Company in 1993, and after directing "Urban Tattoo" at the
Autry in 1999, he and Scott were invited to set up the Native Voices
program at the museum.</TE>
<TE>   "The writing is gorgeous, it's so evocative," Reinholz says during
a break in rehearsals. "At first we didn't understand how it would be
staged--that was the challenge of this piece."</TE>
<TE>   Actress Tonantzin Carmelo, who plays Sister, and Gil Birmingham,
who plays Father, have been involved with "Jump Kiss" since workshops
last year, giving them more time to reflect on the play's framework.</TE>
<TE>   "I see the individual pieces like photographs, and we are bringing
these photographs to life," Carmelo says. "During the play, she's in
a plane, looking at photographs, letting her mind wander as it would
naturally. It's like when you see a photo album, you can put together
pieces of a person's life, although maybe not the whole picture."</TE>
<TE>   For Birmingham, the play addresses "how important it is to know
who you are--because there's an external world that's very lost; how
you hold your core to live a meaningful and purposeful life."</TE>
<TE>   Like the central character in the play, the 61-year-old Glancy
grew up in Kansas, the daughter of a domineering homemaker mother and
a quiet father, who worked in a slaughterhouse and learned to
assimilate into the mainstream culture.</TE>
<TE>   Although her Native American heritage was pushed into the
background during her youth, Glancy still sensed the importance of
her roots. She later did her own research and, for a time, moved to
Oklahoma and lived near her ancestral land.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up, she sensed a repression and a conflict that she
suggests in "Jump Kiss." In one scene, Father says, "How do you
forget your voice? How do you fit two worlds together that don't fit?
By ignoring the one you are, and going with the other. Forgetting
your voice. Forgetting your Indian past."</TE>
<TE>   Her mother, Glancy acknowledges, was repressed as well. "My mother
was a very intelligent woman, but she was very stifled as women were
in those days," she says. "She had a creative imagination and didn't
know what to do with it--it made her very angry sometimes. But her
photographs, that was her outlet I would say." Then she adds, "My
play is a supplement of her photo album. Now it's my turn, I get to
say what I want to say."</TE>
<TE>   While episodes in the play are largely based on real events,
Glancy says, "there's fiction in there also." For example, one scene
revolves around the family helping aging grandparents move from their
longtime homestead. "Some of it is very concrete--moving the
grandparents from the farm takes all day," Glancy says. "Then they're
digging up the house and moving it; it's very bizarre. Of course they
really didn't do that, but [it suggests] the uprooting of the past.
The interconnected imagery shows up again and again in different
ways."</TE>
<TE>   The fluidity of imagery has long been Glancy's calling card. She
is the author of several books of poetry and plays. Her 1996 novel,
"Pushing the Bear," told about the Trail of Tears of 1838-39, when
the federal government forced the Cherokees to abandon their
traditional lands in North Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee for the
Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). Coming out this fall is another book
of plays,  "American Gypsy," which will include "Jump Kiss."</TE>
<TE>   In her works, Glancy attempts to weave "the seen and the unseen
world," she says. "In the past, the ancestors can show up at anytime;
it's a living, fluid narrative. Tribes [and their narrative
traditions], of course, differ so much, but there are some
similarities--this relaxing of boundaries is pretty typical, as well
as the love of story, the importance of words."</TE>
<TE>   What does "jump kiss" mean? Everyone seems to have his own
definition.</TE>
<TE>   "There are moments in your life and time when you get a little
jolt--it's part passion and part danger--and it makes you feel alive;
it makes you think about things you normally don't think about,"
director Reinholz says.</TE>
<TE>   "It reminds me of that line from the Jimi Hendrix song 'excuse me
while I kiss the sky,'" Birmingham says. "'Jump Kiss' to me is the
exhilaration you have when you transcend human bounds, when we become
who we really are and understand the value of our relationship with
one another."</TE>
<TE>   Says Glancy, "It could be riding on a plane, it could be the

<HD>Who Is This Stranger I Married?</HD>
<DH>Several current movies argue that those closest to us are
harboring dark secrets</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN FARBER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many great writers have dramatized the profound misunderstandings
that so often sabotage honest communication. In his Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel, "American Pastoral," Philip Roth mused about our
futile interactions with other people: "You get them wrong before you
meet them, while you're anticipating meeting them; you get them wrong
while you're with them; and then you go home to tell somebody else
about the meeting and you get them all wrong again. Since the same
generally goes for them with you, the whole thing is really a
dazzling illusion empty of all perception, an astonishing farce of
misperception."</LD>
<LD>   But surely there's an exception to this bleak vision of human
separateness? When we finally find a life partner, don't we come to
know that one special person as intimately as we know ourselves?
That's certainly the comforting myth of love and marriage that our
culture has inculcated. Over the decades, movies have helped to
propagate this soothing view of marriage as the triumphant antidote
to human isolation.</LD>
<LD>   At least that used to be the popular cinematic wisdom. Now the
message is being turned on its head. Current films are warning us
that our spouses, the people in whom we place our deepest trust, can
be counted on to cheat, deceive, betray, and abuse us. Consider the
deeply cynical plots of these movies:</LD>
<TE>   * The current hit "Unfaithful," adapted from a Claude Chabrol film
about marital infidelity, focuses on a deceptive wife (Diane Lane)
who embarks on a furtive, torrid extramarital affair and blithely
misleads her husband (Richard Gere). As the story progresses, she
learns that her lover (Olivier Martinez) has his own complicated
marital and romantic history that he's concealed from her.</TE>
<TE>   * In the recent thriller "High Crimes," high-powered attorney
Ashley Judd learns that she doesn't even know the real name of her
loving husband, Jim Caviezel, who had a whole other identity in the
Marines before he married her. Suddenly she has to face the fact that
the man she thought she knew may have slaughtered innocent civilians
in El Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   * The acclaimed French film "Time Out" offers a somewhat different
slant on marital deception. A successful executive loses his job but
is ashamed to tell his wife and family, so he spins a web of lies,
embarks on a series of fictitious business trips, and keeps up the
charade for months.</TE>
<TE>   * In the just-released revenge drama "Enough," there's an even
darker tinge to the tale of marital betrayal. Jennifer Lopez marries
a wealthy construction tycoon (Billy Campbell) who seems to adore
her. It is only after several years of marriage that she realizes he
is not simply a philanderer but a homicidal maniac; he threatens her
with savage physical abuse if she dares to challenge his authority.</TE>
<TE>   * This same motif is part of the back story of the recent thriller
"Murder by Numbers," in which Sandra Bullock plays a tough cop still
trying to come to terms with her marriage to a man who abused her
brutally.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, audiences will see "The Good Girl," a hot ticket at
this year's Sundance Film Festival. Jennifer Aniston plays a bored
checkout clerk who commences an affair with a disturbed co-worker
(Jake Gyllenhaal). Even when her husband (John C. Reilly) discovers
the affair, Aniston continues to lie to him about the true identity
of the father of her child.</TE>
<TE>   In another Sundance hit, "One Hour Photo," also opening this
summer, Robin Williams plays a photo clerk who is mesmerized by the
apparently idyllic life of a family that brings in photographs for
him to develop. When he learns that the husband is cheating on the
wife, he becomes deranged; his illusions about an all-American
marriage are shattered.</TE>
<TE>   It's ironic that this batch of movies is reaching us in the months
after Sept. 11, during a period when we were told there was a boom in
marriages and a growing desire by Americans to cling to hearth and
home as the only reliable source of solace in a world that had turned
supremely hazardous.</TE>
<TE>   Now the movies are undercutting that last bit of comfort, warning
us that we shouldn't trust our spouses any more than we trust the
strangers who may be plotting our destruction. Of course these movies
were all in the works long before Sept. 11, but they may be even more
painful to behold at a time when we're trying to find some common
values that we can still embrace.</TE>
<TE>   I don't mean to suggest that all new movies highlight rotten
marriages. The G-rated hit "The Rookie" tells the story of a high
school coach (Dennis Quaid) who fulfills his dream of pitching in the
major leagues, while his wife (Rachel Griffiths) provides rock-solid
support.</TE>
<TE>   But such ringing tributes to marriage are definitely in the
minority these days.</TE>
<TE>   Good drama often grows from conflict and betrayal rather than
idyllic harmony, so it's understandable that thoughtful writers and
directors want to put marriage under a merciless microscope. Everyone
remembers Tolstoy's dictum that all happy families are alike, whereas
unhappy families contain the distinctive quirks that attract a gifted
writer's attention.</TE>
<TE>   While these new movies may not rise to Tolstoyan heights, they do
expose some painful truths worth heeding. They set out to puncture
complacency by forcing us to contemplate how little we may know about
the people who share our lives.</TE>
<TE>   This dark scrutiny of treacherous lovers is not new. Some
filmmakers have always recognized the haunting possibilities in
stories of poisoned marriages. This potent motif first emerged in
classic thrillers of the '40s like "Suspicion," in which Joan
Fontaine begins to suspect that her husband, Cary Grant, may be
plotting to kill her, and "Gaslight," in which a vulnerable Ingrid
Bergman marries a dapper Charles Boyer, who is scheming to drive her
crazy. Perhaps the most (literally) diabolical tale of marital
betrayal was "Rosemary's Baby," in which Mia Farrow's husband, John
Cassavetes, conspires with a coven of witches to allow his wife to be
impregnated by Satan.</TE>
<TE>   The untrustworthy spouse is a character who continues to intrigue
some of today's best writers and directors. Nicholas Kazan, who wrote
"Enough," has grappled with this theme before. One of his best-known
movies, "Reversal of Fortune," told the creepy story of the Von Bulow
marriage, and Kazan made his directorial debut with "Dream Lover," in
which James Spader discovers that his wife (Madchen Amick) has a
darker history than he imagined.</TE>
<TE>   "'Dream Lover' and 'Enough' are like matched pairs," Kazan admits,
and he adds, "These films interest me because they underscore the
unknowability of other people. Human beings always want to present
their most attractive and tantalizing side to others, but they may be
hiding demons. I've had relationships where stuff emerged over time
that was quite disturbing. In my marriage, there have been times when
I felt I completely understood my wife, and at other times, I felt I
didn't know her at all."</TE>
<TE>   As Kazan suggests, this theme of intimate strangers is a powerful
one. There's really nothing scarier than the prospect of sleeping
with the enemy, to recall the title of a Julia Roberts movie with
some striking similarities to "Enough." Unfortunately, most of these
new movies don't quite do justice to this primal theme. In "Enough,"
it's hard to accept that the abusive husband's true nature could go
unnoticed by his wife for so many years. What does it say about
Lopez's character that she is so oblivious to his psychosis? In its
desire to celebrate female empowerment, the movie glosses over the
heroine's myopia. "Enough" sacrifices psychological complexity to
spin a rousing revenge fantasy.</TE>
<TE>   Credibility is also a major problem in "Unfaithful." The marriage
of Gere and Lane is presented as so picture-perfect at the start that
we have trouble understanding why she falls so quickly into a steamy
affair with a charming stranger. At first it seems like an intriguing
ploy to focus on a happily married woman who is still capable of
being overpowered by anarchic sexual urges. But the movie turns so
moralistic in its later stages, as it belabors the wages of sin, that
the point of the story becomes muddled.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood generally opts for lurid thrills and crude moralizing in
place of psychological acuity. For a more probing dissection of the
unreliable spouse, you might turn to foreign films like the recent
"Time Out." In Laurent Cantet's movie, the husband's disorientation
on losing his job and his secret gratification on inventing a
fictitious existence for himself are rendered with astonishing
intensity. The film sweeps us inside the mind of a man who's almost
addicted to deceit.</TE>
<TE>   Whether they traffic in psychological realism or in melodramatic
terror, these movies have a powerful impact. They remind us to be on
guard, to beware the people closest to us. In this cinematic
landscape of paranoia, everyone is harboring secrets, and everyone is
potentially dangerous. Some of these pictures may be potboilers, but
they tap into some genuinely unsettling nightmares.</TE>

<HD>Barranquilla a Backwater? Not so Fast, Rolling Stone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I started reading the recent Rolling Stone cover story on Shakira but
couldn't get past the crude stereotype in the first paragraph. The
writer correctly identifies the Colombian singer's hometown as
Barranquilla, but then promptly labels it a "backwater."</LD>
<LD>   I'm not Colombian and I've never been to Barranquilla, but I knew
such a derogatory characterization couldn't be right. There's too
much great music coming out of this ancient port city to dismiss it
in passing as a stagnant or backward place.</LD>
<LD>   Reporters should always start with their homework, so here's a
little history/geography lesson. Barranquilla was founded almost 400
years ago, in 1629, and is now the capital of the province (or
departamento) named Atlantico. It happens to be Colombia's
fourth-largest city, with more than 1 million residents, and its
largest port on the Caribbean Sea.</LD>
<TE>   The city isn't actually on the coast, but rather 15 miles upstream
from the mouth of the Magdalena River, the waterway that served as
the setting for "Love in the Time of Cholera," the 1988 novel by
acclaimed Colombian author Gabriel Garcia Marquez.</TE>
<TE>   Barranquilla can claim the Nobel laureate as a native son. Gabo,
as the novelist is affectionately known, moved there with his family
when he was 8. He left home by steamboat at age 13, but always felt
the pull of the coastal culture, vibrant and passionate compared with
the cold formality of Bogota, the capital in the central highlands.</TE>
<TE>   The Colombians I spoke to nearly gagged when they heard
"Barranquilla" and "backwater" in the same sentence. They know the
city as Colombia's "Puerta de Oro," the Gateway of Gold, because it's
awash in goods--and cultural currents--from around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a city where music first arrives from many places," says
Barranquilla native Jose Garces, now a Miami-based concert promoter
who brings Colombia's top acts to the United States. "You hear salsa,
cumbia, vallenato. You get music from Haiti and from Africa. And next
to Brazil, the best carnival is in Barranquilla."</TE>
<TE>   The city's most important modern musical export is Andres Cabas, a
brilliant young singer-songwriter whose recent debut CD stands as one
of the best Latin albums of the year so far. It's an introduction
befitting his cosmopolitan hometown: a vibrant fusion of snarling
rock guitars with lilting tropical melodies and rich, folkloric
rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   For veteran Joe Arroyo, the respected salsa singer and bandleader,
Barranquilla served as a hothouse for his fresh and exotic rhythms,
absorbing all those beats and pulses from other places. Although born
in nearby Cartagena, the former lead singer for Fruko y sus Tesos
started his solo career in Barranquilla a quarter century ago. Arroyo
developed his brand of salsa with original rhythms, including the
narcissistically named Joeson.</TE>
<TE>   Although lesser-known than, say, Oscar D'Leon, another salsero
from neighboring Venezuela, Arroyo has been quite influential. Even
Juanes, Colombia's acclaimed singer-songwriter known for his rock
roots, included one of Arroyo's Caribbean classics on his latest pop
album. Juanes closes his new work with the celebratory "La Noche"
(The Night), which first appeared on Arroyo's 1988 album, "Fuego en
mi Mente" (Fire in my Mind).</TE>
<TE>   That album also includes Arroyo's fiery salsa ode to his adopted
hometown, "En Barranquilla Me Quedo" (I'll Stay in Barranquilla). The
exciting song still prompts L.A. salseros to swarm the dance floor as
Arroyo showers praise on the "enchanting" city, its "warm, welcoming
people" and their "grand society."</TE>
<TE>   That ain't just boosterism, says Rodrigo Obregon, a proud native
of Barranquilla who's now pursuing an acting career in Los Angeles.
He says his hometown is everything the song says it is, and more.</TE>
<TE>   "Barranquilla has always been an oasis of peace in Colombia," says
Obregon, who recently played a Colombian CIA operative in the Arnold
Schwarzenegger film "Collateral Damage" "It's a very civil place
where all social classes get along under the harmony of a single,
common culture."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody gets more enthusiastic or waxes more spontaneously poetic
about the place than Obregon, whose pioneering family built the
nation's first textile plant and first tourist hotel, the El Prado.
His mother, Sonia Osorio, is the director of the Ballet de Colombia
in Bogota. His father, the late Alejandro Obregon, was a renowned
painter and founder of La Cueva, a group of bohemian writers,
intellectuals and adventurers who gathered at a Barranquilla bar of
the same name to discuss Faulkner and Steinbeck.</TE>
<TE>   Obregon says he feels pity for those--including journalists who
should know better--whose ignorance prevents them from exploring
beyond the stereotypes of "banana republics" and "Third World
backwaters."</TE>
<TE>   But you can't really blame them too much. The World Book
Encyclopedia has no mention of Barranquilla. And even my own
newspaper mostly mentions the city in a negative context: Of the 97
Times stories that have cited the city since 1985, the vast majority
were about drugs, crime, guerrilla war or corruption.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet tells you more about Barranquilla as the site of
Colombia's first telephone and its first plane flight. The city's
wharf, once the longest in the world, was an engineering marvel in
its day, providing harbor to a stunning array of ships and people
from all over the world.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the Staten Island of Colombia," says Obregon, a member
of the L.A.-based civic group Unidos Por Colombia. "Progress itself
entered through Barranquilla."</TE>

<HD>Chilling Out -- for Him</HD>
<DH>After a tailspin he describes as temporary insanity, Eminem
got his act together--though his mom might not be too happy to hear
it</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The tension during Eminem's performance at an RFK Stadium concert is
escalating as thousands of young rock and rap fans slam against each
other with such force that you sense bones are about to snap.</LD>
<LD>   Police huddle anxiously during a 15-minute break in the music to
see if they should let the concert resume. This isn't Bono, the
friend of popes and presidents, performing on stage. It's Eminem, the
rapper who once wrote a song about killing his wife and who cusses
out the vice president's wife on his latest CD.</LD>
<LD>   Rebellion and outrage are Eminem's trademarks, so it's anybody's
guess what he might do if he returns to the stage. What if he tries
to fuel his angry image on stage by attacking the police for
interfering with the concert?</LD>
<TE>   Eminem finally picks up a microphone and addresses the crowd. "OK,
I'm going to count to three and then everybody take one step back.
One, two, three ... take one step back."</TE>
<TE>   The crowd begins to respond. He repeats the instruction two more
times and the tension eases. Eminem resumes his performance.</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit rapper came to this all-day, radio-sponsored concert
last weekend to promote his new album, "The Eminem Show," and to use
the capital setting to showcase "White America," a song on the album
that decries the FCC and others for threatening to censor his music.</TE>
<TE>   But he made another kind of statement. Ever since his arrival on
the pop scene in 1999, Eminem--Marshall Bruce Mathers III--has been
seen as a virtual madman by many anxious parents, a hero who
challenges authority by millions of young fans, and a complex but
major artist by critics and enough members of the recording academy
for "The Marshall Mathers LP" to be nominated for best album in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   It's as if there are three faces of Eminem.</TE>
<TE>   On this humid spring day, there was only one way Eminem
looked--responsible.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview here hours before taking the stage, Eminem--as
soft-spoken offstage as he is bratty and confrontational on
it--suggested he is emerging from a personal darkness that fueled not
only his lyrics, but also his private life.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel good about myself ... and there have been times in my
life, including not that long ago, that I didn't know if I'd ever be
able to say that again. I can't tell you that I had a clear head a
couple of years ago because of all the stuff that was going on around
me.</TE>
<TE>   "Ending up on probation was almost a blessing in disguise ... not
being able to do drugs and stuff. I needed to do that anyway because
I'm a father, and the worst thing I could ever do was come home off
tour and be [messed up], me going through withdrawals or something.
It's cool to go out and have fun every now and then, but I'd rather
be a father before anything."</TE>
<TE>   The most alarming thing about Eminem earlier in the day as he sits
in hotel room just around the corner from the Capitol building is the
mound of bacon and eggs on the plate in front of him. It's 2 p.m.,
but he's just starting his day.</TE>
<TE>   "Want some bacon?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   Instinctively, I say something about not wanting all that
cholesterol, and he smiles. "I try not to eat too much of this
either, but I just get a craving sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   Eminem, 29, is wearing the loose-fitting sports gear that rappers
have turned into a fashion statement for young America. It's pretty
much the same outfit he had on when I first met him two years ago.
The main difference is the pricey Rolex watch on his arm.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, that," he says, playfully. "That's my Jimmy Iovine watch"--a
gift from Interscope Records co-founder Jimmy Iovine for selling 30
million albums.</TE>
<TE>   Three things stood out in that 2000 interview with Eminem: He was
courteous, smart and oh-so-tightly wound. The first two qualities
were surprising given the startling, X-rated nature of his music.</TE>
<TE>   The tension made sense though, because his first album had sold
3.5 million copies in the U.S., and he was under a lot of pressure to
match that amount at a time in pop music when fan loyalty has been an
elusive quality.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it was hard to believe the polite young man in the studio
was the same one who was charged two weeks later with using a gun to
hit a man who had kissed Eminem's then-wife in a nightclub. Two days
later, he was arrested again and charged with wielding a gun in an
altercation with an associate of the rap group Insane Clown Posse.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in temporary insanity," he says now in the hotel room,
referring to the Michigan incidents. "I believe that somebody can do
something to you that can make you so mad that you literally can't
control yourself."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the insanity of the moment he saw the man kissing his wife
is mirrored on the album when he raps, "What I did was stupid, no
doubt it was dumb, but the smartest [thing] I did was take them
bullets out of that gun / Cause I'da killed 'em."</TE>
<TE>   "I was going crazy," he adds about that period. "Fame was hitting
me. I wasn't even two years into all this when we talked. I had just
bought a house. To show you how naive I was, I bought it on the main
road. I had no idea how famous I really was, especially in Detroit,
and people were coming by there day and night. Plus, I had the
pressure of my relationship with a certain female in my life [his
ex-wife] that was falling apart.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference now is that I came through all that and I've still
got the things I love. In this album, I spoke about a lot of that
journey. There are a lot of the same people in the songs, my mom, my
ex-wife, my daughter, but it's not just the same story. If you look
at the songs closely, you can see there's some closure there. I have
things in order."</TE>
<TE>   That closure is most obvious in "Cleaning Out My Closet," a savage
message to his father, who split when Eminem was just a few months
old, and his mother, whom he has blamed for his largely dysfunctional
childhood.</TE>
<TE>   Most of his rage is directed at his mother, "Remember when [my
uncle] Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?/Well guess
what, I am dead./Dead to you as can be."</TE>
<TE>   "I wrote that for my mother and people can see it for whatever it
is, mean or not, maybe just me venting," he says. "But I'm just
getting a lot of stuff off my chest. It's like closing a chapter in
my life. I'm not thinking of anyone else hearing this when I'm making
the record. I'm just writing it for her and thinking how she's going
to feel because of how she made me feel."</TE>
<TE>   Parents have been worried about the effect of pop and rock
rebellion on their youngsters ever since the sexual energy of Elvis
Presley in the '50s. But Eminem seems to evoke unusually deep fears.
The two things adults normally ask about Eminem is why does the music
have to be so violent and doesn't he feel any responsibility to young
people.</TE>
<TE>   Eminem admits he's trying to provoke in his music, because that's
what he liked about music when he was a teen. But he maintains his
young listeners get the humor and exaggeration in the songs, and that
they can draw strength from the darker moments.</TE>
<TE>   "If you listen to the album as a whole, you'll see a lot of
different mood swings," he says, pushing the breakfast tray away and
leaving half of the eggs untouched. "With each song, I try to make it
fall into three categories. Is it happy? Is it sad? Or is it anger?
If it's not one of those, then there's no feel to the song and I'll
throw it out."</TE>
<TE>   There are a lot of other possible emotions, but songwriters are
often drawn to particular themes again and again because it hits an
emotional nerve in them. When asked why he wrote so many sad love
songs, Leonard Cohen responded, "The question presumes I have a
choice in the matter."</TE>
<TE>   Eminem thinks his only responsibility to his audience is to make
the most honest and entertaining music he can.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a baby-sitter for anyone else's kids," he says
matter-of-factly, a line he's probably used before to explain
himself. "I have one seed and that's all I need and that's all I'm
responsible for raising. That's why there is an advisory sticker on
the albums. If you are a parent, you should watch what your kids are
listening to."</TE>
<TE>   There are plenty of moments on the new album that will give
parents pause, moments ugly and troubling. One reason Eminem is such
a complex artist is that he can be seductive musically when he's
simply trying to be a mainstream entertainer or when he's dealing
with topics that seem more suited for a therapist's couch.</TE>
<TE>   Most noticeably, Eminem continues to show a discouraging lack of
respect for women, which seems strange given his devotion to his
6-year-old daughter, Hailie. The youngster spends lots of time with
the rapper under a joint-custody agreement with his ex-wife.</TE>
<TE>   Eminem has one of the most dynamic, motormouth deliveries ever in
rap, but his talent goes deeper than his words. While Dr. Dre is the
executive producer on "The Eminem Show," Eminem did the production
work on most of the album's tracks himself.</TE>
<TE>   His most revolutionary contribution to rap, however, has been his
ability as a storyteller to step past the gangsta cliches of
hard-core rap to give us personalized stories of anguish and desire
that have a greater universality and depth.</TE>
<TE>   At one place on his album, Eminem taunts parents by saying he
doesn't blame them for getting upset about his music. "I wouldn't let
Hailie listen to me neither."</TE>
<TE>   Eminem laughs when the line is mentioned.</TE>
<TE>   "I was kidding with that line," he says. "The irony of it is she's
on that song with me. That's her going, 'I think my dad's gone
crazy.' I'm doing that just to push people's buttons ... to push the
envelope as far as it will go. I'm a pretty liberal parent, but if
there are too many cuss words in a row, I'll make sure Hailie hears
the clean version.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is an [expletive] here and there, that's fine. I would
rather her hear that this way than hear it at school or behind my
back. Me and Hailie have a little understanding. When she hears those
words, she knows they are bad and she knows not to repeat them. She's
pretty good at that. Believe it or not, she is a happy little girl.
She's always got a smile on her face, always upbeat. She's the most
important thing in my life, and I want to make sure she has
everything I never did in life."</TE>
<TE>   But he knows there's a world of fans trying to combat the same low
self-esteem and struggle that he went through.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone came to me and said nothing was working for him at
school or at home, I'd say, 'Find an outlet, something you're good at
and believe in and lock in on that.' For me, it was music. Early,
early on, it was comic books and drawing. I used to draw a lot. I
used to be able to escape into those things and I had certain
relatives that I could go visit and try to get away from that because
I hated school and I hated being at home. It was like I had nothing
to look forward to, but music changed that."</TE>
<TE>   It's not just his themes that are evolving in the new album, but
his sound too. There are traces of '70s rock guitars and even a
sample of Aerosmith's "Dream On" in one track.</TE>
<TE>   "I listened to a bit of rock in the late '70s," Eminem explains.
"There was some Aerosmith, some Queen, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin. If
hip-hop had never come along, I may have gone that way."</TE>
<TE>   Once he heard hip-hop, while still in grade school, he knew he
found his future. He loved the wordplay and the competition of rap
contests around Detroit. Although he struggled in school, he studied
the dictionary to improve his vocabulary.</TE>
<TE>   Interscope's Iovine played a key role in launching Eminem when he
was so impressed by the rapper's demo tape four years ago that he
passed it along to producer Dr. Dre, who also loved the clever
wordplay and machine-gun delivery on the tape. At the time, the idea
of a quality, best-selling white rapper in black hip-hop seemed
absurd.</TE>
<TE>   But Dre's endorsement and production work, along with the steady
support of manager Paul Rosenberg, helped establish Eminem as the
best-selling artist in rap history. His first two albums have sold
more than 30 million copies worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   The new one wasn't scheduled to be released until Tuesday, but it
was moved up to May 28 because of widespread downloading and piracy.
With Interscope's permission, some stores began selling it as soon as
it arrived May 24. Its three-day total of 285,000 copies was enough
to make it enter the sales chart Wednesday at No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   While Eminem hopes his success opens a door for other white
rappers, he seems humble about his place in the rap hierarchy.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I feel like people just couldn't believe there was a
white guy who was good at rap, so they made me seem like I was more
incredible than the next man, when the truth is I don't even put
myself in the same league as people like Jay-Z and Redman and
Biggie," Eminem says, his bleached blond hair covered by a Nike
skullcap.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of people also don't understand the skill that is involved
in rap. They'll just look at the last rhyme in a line. The challenge
in hip-hop is to do compound syllable rhymes so that you have a flow
to the sentence that carries the words along. That's the secret of
what makes rap so cool."</TE>
<TE>   Eminem may seem like he's always on television or in magazines,
but he does far fewer interviews than most stars of his stature. He
thinks mystique is important, plus one senses that he, like a lot of
performers who grew up with low self-esteem, wonders if he's really
all that interesting.</TE>
<TE>   His big gamble is starring in an upcoming film based loosely on
his life. Titled "8 Mile," a reference to the dividing line between
economic classes in Detroit, the film was directed by Curtis Hanson,
whose credits include "L.A. Confidential" and "Wonder Boys." It's due
in November.</TE>
<TE>   "The script was great," Eminem says, when asked why he would agree
to act in a film, given the history of so many pop acting
embarrassments. "I felt like even if I'm halfway decent in it, it's
going to be great. Besides, I enjoyed making videos. But this was a
lot different. One of the hardest things was stripping myself of
whatever ego and confidence I have to play this character, Jimmy.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to go back to when I was just Marshall and I was reserved
and shy and nobody cared much about me, and I didn't know if I could
ever reach my dreams. It's weird when you think I only had to go back
about four years to find that point in my life."</TE>
<TE>   Eminem will tour this summer, but don't expect him to be on the
road indefinitely. "There's part of me that loves being on stage, but
I don't want to be on the road 200 days a year or anything," he says
at the hotel. "That's no life for my little girl."</TE>
<TE>   After the RFK concert that evening, Eminem doesn't stick around
for the usual post-show parties. He's soon on the way to the airport
for the flight back to Detroit. You can guess who he's eager to see.</TE>

<HD>Who's Soaring Now?</HD>
<DH>In 'Spider-Man,' technique serves the story. In the frozen
'Attack of the Clones,' it is the story.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1962, movie critic Manny Farber looked at the work of European
art-house directors like Francois Truffaut, Michelangelo Antonioni
and Tony Richardson, and pronounced it sluggish and bloated with
pointless, pretentious technique. Yes, their films were made with
painterly precision and brimmed with elegant eye-candy. But the
characters? They were flat, emotionally over-controlled and locked
into the frame like figures on a Grecian temple.</LD>
<LD>   "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones" is no "Jules and
Jim," yet in an odd way Farber's description perfectly fits the new
George Lucas blockbuster, especially when you compare it with its
biggest summer rival, Sam Raimi's "Spider-Man." Lucas has said that
digital production and new special-effects technology have freed his
imagination to make the "Star Wars" movies he always wanted to make.
Maybe so.</LD>
<LD>   But the result, in the series' two most recent pictures, "The
Phantom Menace" and "Attack of the Clones," has been monumentally
static. "Attack of the Clones" has the same costly special effects,
kinetic action sequences and swooping, vertical-angled shots that
"Spider-Man" does. But while "Spider-Man" is visually alluring, witty
and exhilarating, "Attack of the Clones" is mostly just plain
exhausting.</LD>
<TE>   What brings Spidey to life while "Clones" dozes? Maybe it's that
while "Spider-Man's" look never loses touch with the movie's
comic-book roots, "Attack of the Clones" goes for an overblown,
operatic grandeur that reduces character and plot to an afterthought.
Without condescending to its pulpy source material, "Spider-Man"
elevates the action-adventure genre, while "Attack of the Clones"
merely overwhelms it with big, portentous digital set pieces.
"Clones" is a bore. "Spider-Man" keeps its feet on the ground,
conceptually, and it soars.</TE>
<TE>   Like its youthful hero, Peter Parker (played with understated
acuteness by Tobey Maguire), "Spider-Man's" design is deceptively
simple. The movie's opening credits unspool over a montage of
comic-book panels, invoking the eye-tickling graphic environment
created by series co-creator Stan Lee (one of the movie's executive
producers). But like the seemingly bland and innocuous Peter Parker,
"Spider-Man" has a few surprises up its spandex sleeve.</TE>
<TE>   Director Raimi, who earned his spurs with the low-budget yet
cunningly stylized "Evil Dead" series, and his production designer,
Neil Spisak, have synthesized two very different design sensibilities
here: a loud, humorous Pop art syntax, which animates "Spider-Man's"
superhero antics; and an affectionate, sepia-toned vision of New York
City, with all its gritty charms and architectural marvels viewed
from our hero's unique high-flying perspective.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Warhol would have loved "Spider-Man's" combination of
radiance and self-aware humor, which stops short of camp. Both Spidey
and his adversary, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), are as brightly
attired as Brillo boxes. From the moment early in the film when Peter
Parker is bitten by a genetically altered arachnid, "Spider-Man"
crackles with brash visual wit, like a New York tabloid front page.</TE>
<TE>   In one dazzling sight gag, we see a high school corridor through
Parker's DNA-altered vision: a paper airplane hanging in suspension,
a buzzing fly slowed to a snail's pace, a bully's fist inching toward
Parker's face. In another, the webs on Spider-Man's tunic morph into
Manhattan's tangled street grid, filled with yellow cabs scampering
like berserk insects. And in an image that neatly fuses comedy and
pathos, Spider-Man receives a grateful kiss from his unsuspecting
love interest, M.J., as he dangles upside-down in the rain.</TE>
<TE>   "Spider-Man" drops sly pop references to other movies, a
postmodern practice that "Star Wars" helped invent. Peter Parker's
bid to raise cash by going mano a mano with a goonish pro wrestler in
a cage recalls a similar Mel Gibson showdown in "Mad Max Beyond
Thunderdome" (1985). And when the Green Goblin launches his lethal
assault on Times Square, he blazes over the Manhattan skyline on a
kind of jet-propelled surfboard, bringing to mind the Wicked Witch of
the West skywriting "Surrender Dorothy" above Oz.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Gotham of the first "Batman" movie, brilliantly
realized by the late Anton Furst, or the Metropolis of the "Superman"
films, much of "Spider-Man" takes place in a recognizable New York of
elevated trains and grimy streets, of larger-than-life edifices like
the Chrysler Building (where Spider-Man goes to brood on an
ornamental eagle) and drab, look-alike outer borough residential
rows.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the sanitized, haute bourgeois fairy-tale New York of
Woody Allen films. In spirit, it may be closer to the explosive,
color-coded Brooklyn of Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing" (though
without Lee's hip-hop hyperbole). This New York is a dangerous city
where buildings topple and people die: The Times Square attack
conveys genuine horror and panic, as a high-rise crumbles and
terrified pedestrians dodge falling debris.</TE>
<TE>   Yet "Spider-Man" also takes a loving, even rapturous view of New
York. When Spider-Man alights on a wall or rooftop, we glimpse
Manhattan's Beaux Arts facades and upper-story exterior sculpture,
the architectural treasures that so often elude pedestrians. This
homey point of view flows naturally from the movie's conception of
its main character, a guy who leaps tall buildings but remains firmly
tethered to his human relationships. "Spider-Man's" contrasting but
complementary sensibilities, the Pop and the poetic, unite in the
sequence in which Parker first tests his webs. He tries several
times, a puzzled look on his face, before succeeding in firing a
gooey projectile at a rooftop target across the street.</TE>
<TE>   At the screening I attended, the audience broke into cheering and
applause, much as those lucky first-wave viewers did in 1977 when the
Millennium Falcon makes the jump to cyberspace in the original "Star
Wars."</TE>
<TE>   Compare this sequence to the airborne, emotionally stillborn chase
scene near the start of "Attack of the Clones." Anakin Skywalker
(Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), in pursuit
of an anonymous assassin, take off on a wild ride through the urban
canyons of Coruscant. The surrounding high-rise nightscape goes by in
an impressionistic blur, as Lucas' jumpy camera seldom stays with
anything long enough to bring it into focus or let us savor the
details. You might as well be watching a high-speed video game--with
your kid brother's hand gripping the joystick.</TE>
<TE>   Even when the chase finally crash-lands at a nightclub, there's
none of the throwaway levity or charm that Lucas put into the famous
cantina scene in the original "Star Wars." (You'd find freakier,
funnier patrons on Saturday night at Universal CityWalk.) Humorlessly
single-minded, the scene lumbers forward, seldom pausing to take in
the expensive props and scenery that Lucas and his top-rank design
team have assembled.</TE>
<TE>   What Raimi grasps, and Lucas appears to have forgotten, is that
gee-whiz visuals work best when they advance the story and
occasionally intersect with the characters' personality traits. It
was Harrison Ford's swashbuckling bravado as Han Solo that set up the
thrilling payoff to the Millennium Falcon jump-start scene.
Similarly, it's Maguire's subtle facial expressions, his bafflement
morphing into delight, that make his web-spewing trick more than just
an impressive stunt.</TE>
<TE>   The "Star Wars" aesthetic, of course, has always been a hodgepodge
of influences, just as its mythic themes are new riffs on age-old
stories like the Oedipus legend.</TE>
<TE>   Darth Vader's costume, for instance, is equal parts German storm
trooper and Japanese samurai, and the visual appeal of the first
three "Star Wars" films lay in their dexterous mixing and matching of
high-culture tropes and B-movie cheesiness. They took their cues from
comics like "Flash Gordon," perhaps the first "space opera" to
combine sci-fi technology with period costumes and archaic
architectural settings.</TE>
<TE>   But in "Phantom Menace" and "Clones," the series' stylish
retro-futurism has given way to arbitrary pastiche. In these movies,
the background echoes of Fritz Lang's "Metropolis" and Ridley Scott's
"Blade Runner" (Coruscant), William Wyler's "Ben-Hur" (the pod race
in "Phantom") and John Ford's Monument Valley westerns (Anakin's home
planet of Tatooine) lack interesting twists that would make them seem
fresh. Although impressive in sheer scale, they appear less like
newly minted fantasy worlds than like impersonations of old movie
sets--just as the robotic actors appear to be body doubles of
themselves rather than flesh-and-blood beings.</TE>
<TE>   A rare moment of Chaplinesque visual wit occurs in "Attack of the
Clones" when Anakin and friends are trapped on a massive
machine-assembly line and C-3PO's head is knocked off and stapled
onto a robot body. And there's a compelling cruelty to the three
genuinely scary monsters unleashed against Anakin, Obi-Wan and Padme
Amidala (Natalie Portman) when they've been taken prisoner, a touch
of the darker sensibility that is central to the "Star Wars" myth but
curiously underplayed in the last two films. Yet there's no single
image in "Attack of the Clones" as remotely lyrical or memorable as
the twin sunset in "Star Wars," or Han Solo frozen in carbonite in
"The Empire Strikes Back."</TE>
<TE>   Even in Hollywood, fantasy realms often work best when they bear
some connection to the universe the rest of us inhabit, so as to keep
from flying off into deep space. In "Attack of the Clones," the
beautiful queen-turned-senator Padme says as much when she tells her
bodyguard, Anakin Skywalker, to get a reality check. "We live in a
real world!" she rails at him. "Come back to it!" If only "Star Wars"
could heed that advice.</TE>

<HD>Touching Up 'Turandot'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So, after 76 years of Puccini's "Turandot," performed with a glorious
climax by Franco Alfano, Luciano Berio is commissioned to rewrite the
ending ("Bridge to the Future," by Jan Breslauer, May 26). Maybe
Alfano's contribution isn't perfect, but Berio's work is a totally
forgettable anticlimax that adds nothing of value to Puccini's
masterpiece while subtracting much splendor.</LD>
<LD>   Calendar's story says Berio's ending wasn't ready to premiere at
La Scala. Maybe so; however, his substitution was unlikely to be
tolerated by the demanding and musically astute Milanese, and that's
a much more likely reason that L.A. Opera was selected for this
premiere.</LD>
<LD>   As meager as Berio's talent is, however, the real travesty here is
Gian-Carlo del Monaco's staging of the final scene with a touch of
necrophilia and a homage to "Basic Instinct" (with dagger but,
unfortunately, without Sharon Stone).</LD>
<TE>   Poor Audrey Stottler's Turandot couldn't be heard above the
orchestra and, as shown on your cover page, she was burdened with the
ugliest costume of all time, even worse than the production's
Mandarin with the pink Mohawk. Hei-Kyung Hong's Liu was lovely, and
Franco Farina as Calaf hit all the right notes and was a good sport
about kissing the corpse.</TE>

<TE>   P.D. Inc., who brought to Los Angeles the Bach B-minor Mass as a
staged revenge of the mud people with elementary school reject art,
has delivered Los Angeles another turkey.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Puccini is responsible for the premature ejaculation in
Act 2, and perhaps Toscanini was dead right stopping the performance
where he did.</TE>
<TE>   Gee! I can hardly wait for "Gianni Schicchi" realized as the Marx
Brothers meet Mussolini--coming soon to an opera house in Los
Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Warhol Versus Picasso</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Being "no Picasso" is quite a compliment ("After the First 15
Minutes," by Christopher Knight, May 19). The Picasso tradition is a
selfish style, accessible to few. Such "explorations of form" are art
school preparations for creating true art. It took Warhol to expose
that style to scrutiny.</LD>
<LD>   While I disagree with Knight's contextualizing of Warhol's work, I
firmly believe that art should evoke thought as well as feeling.
Warhol's work still resonates on both of those levels today, while
Picasso's works, especially those based on African art he
"discovered" at the Trocadero, lack any sort of artistic maturity.</LD>

<HD>'Shaft' Transcended Race</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The original "Shaft" was not blaxploitation. John Shaft was the first
black hero image with an appeal to both black and white ("Creative
Soul Mates," by Anne Valdespino, May 26). Pictures that followed,
such as "Superfly," were definitely the kind of pictures described by
the adjective "blaxploitation."</LD>
<LD>   On behalf of Gordon Parks, the director, and myself, the producer
of the original "Shaft," we certainly don't agree that "Shaft" should
be mentioned in the same genre as those films that followed. "Shaft"
was filmed entirely in New York for a cost of $1.24 million, and it
was extremely successful because it appealed to both black and white
audiences.</LD>
<LD>   I concur that John Singleton didn't get the attitude right in his
interpretation of Shaft's nephew in the remake.</LD>
<TE>   Richard Roundtree as the original John Shaft was cool, and Samuel
L. Jackson in the remake was downright mean.</TE>
<TE>   JOEL FREEMAN</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Valdespino is a little fuzzy on her history. The studio system
began its decline in the early '50s when studios had to sell off
their theaters and lost direct feedback on audience response to their
product. They continued to make films aimed at the declining "adult"
audience while exhibitors' bread and butter came from steadfast 12-
to 24-year-olds, whose tastes ran to action and horror films.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, white flight to the suburbs in the '60s left
big-city downtown movie palaces to black audiences, whose tastes also
ran to the latter types of films.</TE>
<TE>   That it was economically viable to target films to this audience
was proved by the sleeper success of the now-forgotten 1968 film "If
He Hollers, Let Him Go." This paved the way for "Cotton Comes to
Harlem" (1970), then "Shaft" (1971), which led to the explosion of
blaxploitation films the following year.</TE>
<TE>   Valdespino is to be commended for acknowledging that these films
were as popular with other racial and ethnic groups as with blacks, a
point other writers on the genre tend to overlook.</TE>

<LD>I'm one of the founders of Triumvirate Pi Theatre. Part of our
mission in producing live theater in L.A. is to make the experience
accessible to all, so all shows are captioned ("Words Can Describe
It," by Lynn Smith, May 26).</LD>
<LD>   Co-artistic director Leslie K. Gray and I met with members of the
San Fernando Valley chapter of Self Help for the Hard of Hearing to
strategize and support them in their efforts to get real-time
captioning at selected live performances in L.A.'s major venues, much
as selected performances are now signed.</LD>
<LD>   As for our own 99-seat-plan productions, for "Collected Shadows,"
which ran at the Secret Rose Theatre in NoHo in November, we built a
scrim into the set design and projected the dialogue via LCD
projector.</LD>
<TE>   For "Reds, Whites, and Blues," opening Aug. 1 as a site-specific
play in a hotel suite at the Los Angeles Athletic Club, we've come up
with a system that will use the two TV sets in the suite.</TE>

<LD>I first saw Moby in 1998 in a small, run-down venue ("What Do You
See, Moby?" by Robert Hilburn, May 12). He came out late because he
was a bit under the weather. I was amazed at the way Moby got the
crowd moving. People were jumping, singing and worry-free for those
two hours.</LD>
<LD>   After that show, I saw him in Toronto at the Area:One show and I
became convinced he is a genius. After seeing such acts as U2 twice,
Chemical Brothers, Crystal Method, Paul Oakenfold and others, I can
safely say Moby is a top contender. The Chemical Brothers are my
favorite because they brought me into the music.</LD>

<HD>Before the Critics Have Their Say</HD>
<DH>In the nurturing environment of Fieldwork, professional
choreographers can get feedback from respected veterans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICTORIA LOOSELEAF</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A writer confronts the blank page, a painter an empty canvas, but how
does a dancer make a dance?</LD>
<LD>   Usually it starts with a body, the choreographer's own, and a
mirror. As it evolves, it's utterly ephemeral--there's no sketch to
show, no manuscript to pass around.</LD>
<LD>   Which is why L.A.'s Dance Resource Center has begun sponsoring
Fieldwork, a set of carefully formulated workshops meant to create a
nurturing but stringent environment in which performers can develop
ideas.</LD>
<TE>   Created by and named for the Field, a New York nonprofit group
that helps all kinds of artists develop ideas, the workshop format
requires a facilitator but also relies on other participants to guide
the process. The choreography sessions require participants to bring
in five minutes of movement--it may be a complete dance or just a
fragment, a movement idea--for critiques. Responses are focused by
the facilitator, but everyone can offer opinions.</TE>
<TE>   Arianne MacBean, artistic director of the modern-dance troupe the
Big Show Co., wanted to inaugurate Fieldwork in Los Angeles, based on
her experiences with the method as a freelance dancer in New York.
While serving on the Dance Resource Center's board last year, MacBean
suggested the organization sponsor the workshops.</TE>
<TE>   MacBean recruited a quartet of veteran choreographer-dancers:
Victoria Marks (her most recent work premieres at Los Angeles Theater
Center later this month), Dan Froot (recently seen in collaborations
with David Dorfman), Douglas Nielsen, (former dancer and now a
teacher at Cal State Long Beach) and 1960s improvisational guru
Simone Forti.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen dancers paid a nominal fee to participate; the resulting
works in progress will be performed tonight at Highways Performance
Space in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm producing it and also participating," says MacBean, who moved
to L.A. in 1996 to attend graduate school at CalArts "Often, as a
choreographer, you never get to hear how people are reading your
dance--except in the end with critics, when it's too late. It's not
healthy, and it's not a good process. I think we need to show our
work to each other and we need to communicate."</TE>
<TE>   The Fieldwork structure is simple. Each participant dances, and
then the feedback begins. The facilitator starts the critique. No
references to work outside the workshop are allowed, and there is no
dialogue, no side conversations or "cross-talk"--reactions are
addressed only to the dancer who isn't allowed, or required, to
respond.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very businesslike, yet incredibly efficient and supportive,"
explains MacBean. When others agree with a point that's been made,
"they knock on their chairs. You end up getting 14 perspectives on
your piece."</TE>
<TE>   During the third week of the L.A. workshop series, 10 participants
performed their five minutes. The facilitator was dance teacher
Nielsen, former principal dancer with Israel's Batsheva Dance Company
and onetime member of New York companies headed by Pearl Lang and Gus
Solomons. He began by telling the performers that "every dance should
work with no props, costumes or lighting."</TE>
<TE>   MacBean operated a tape deck as Mary Bender and Don Bondi
performed Bender's work, which involved the use of a walker. Rebecca
Keyser-Houck brought a guitarist and displayed a series of
aggressive, body-slapping moves. MacBean and Robin Conrad performed
next: Conrad sat on a chair while MacBean circled the floor in a work
about finding one's voice.</TE>
<TE>   As the performances unfolded, the other participants took notes.
Respectful applause followed each piece. Trailing white scarves,
Elizabeth Hoefner danced to the mournful Barber Adagio. Maria
Gillespie, her feet bandaged, nevertheless moved as if electrically
charged.</TE>
<TE>   When the choreographers were finished, the group assembled in a
circle. MacBean used a stopwatch to allocate seven minutes of
discussion per work. (The time varies according to the number of
participants each week.) Nielsen talked about perspective with
Keyser-Houck, questioning the rear placement of the musician and
Keyser-Houck's straight-ahead stance. "Why are you facing front?" he
asked. "I don't always believe in the diagonal, but in this case, it
might be less jarring.</TE>
<TE>   "Then there is the question of center stage being a safe
distance," he added, "where I watch the performance rather than enter
it." Her colleagues knocked their chairs in agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Nielsen moved on to notes for another choreographer, Miriam
Kramer, whose ending, he thought, seemed unresolved. "When the music
climaxed," he said, making a reference to choreographer Antony Tudor,
"he wouldn't dance to it. There's something to be said for
stillness."</TE>
<TE>   Gillespie spoke up as well, praising the way Kramer had pared down
the piece from a previous session.</TE>
<TE>   And so on around the circle. When it was Hoefner's turn, Nielsen
wondered if she knew the way Highways would be configured for the
performance, suggesting that her elongated moves might need to be
adjusted for the space. Another comment complimented a windmilling
arm movement, yet another suggested that the scarves were creating a
bridal theme.</TE>
<TE>   Hoefner teaches at Rio Hondo College, dances with the Big Show Co.
and has been making her own works for seven years. The workshops are
"really helpful" she says afterward. For one thing, there's the
matter of her props. "I had originally intended to use claws,
extensions off each finger," she says, "but the feedback was that the
piece was more about light, heavenly imagery. I came up with scarves.
Every week I show, I get a little bit clearer on what I'm doing."</TE>
<TE>   Nielsen wraps up the workshop with a reminder that creating dance
is about making choices, from the title to the costume. "We have to
wrestle forever with these things," he explained. "Viola Farber said
she stopped choreographing because she couldn't decide whether to
turn left or right. Eventually we make a choice and live with it."</TE>
<TE>   The workshops are meant to help all kinds of artists with that
sort of editing, says Diane Vivona, director of the Field.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, she says, Fieldwork generates more than 300 new works.
"It makes the work better. You become more articulate about your
work, you're able to see other peoples' process."</TE>
<TE>   "You get the information and you take it or you don't," MacBean
says. "From week to week, the pieces do change; they really do
progress."</TE>

<HD>The Storm at the Smithsonian</HD>
<DH>Its latest chief's belief in 'modernization and money' has
roiled an institution long in flux like never before</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Tempers were aflame in 1861 as the nation's capital prepared for war.
So officials gave the secretary of the Smithsonian guns and 240
rounds of ammunition "for the protection of the Institute, against
lawless attacks."</LD>
<LD>   The current secretary of the Smithsonian must sometimes wish for a
similar arsenal, even if the weaponry dates back more than 100 years.</LD>
<LD>   Brought in 21/2 years ago to improve the bottom line and the buzz
at the Smithsonian's 16 museums and galleries, eight research centers
and one National Zoo, Lawrence Small--a banker by profession and a
collector by avocation--has instead provoked his own civil war.</LD>
<TE>   Since Small's arrival, markers of an institution in turmoil have
popped up almost monthly: Directors of six museums submitted their
resignations. Congress had to step in to save pioneering scientific
research. A benefactor withdrew $38 million after her ideas were
ridiculed by staffers. And more than 200 academics protested the
"commercialization" of the Smithsonian--even faulting its decision to
award the cafeteria contract at the National Air and Space Museum to
McDonald's.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a turbulent time," said Paula DePriest, a scientist at the
National Museum of Natural History who is chairwoman of the
Smithsonian Congress of Scholars Council. "It's unlike anything in
our history."</TE>
<TE>   Small--who declined a request to be interviewed for this story--is
the only secretary in the Smithsonian's history who is neither a
scientist nor an academic. Formerly president of Fannie Mae, the
nation's largest mortgage lender, and before that a vice chairman at
Citibank in New York, Small, 60, said in a speech shortly after his
arrival that "modernization and money" were his twin goals.</TE>
<TE>   "In a nutshell, I want to modernize everything of consequence at
the Smithsonian," he told the 6,300 Smithsonian staff members via
videotape. Few would deny that the 156-year-old institution needs a
facelift and funds, but Small's business strategies and his brusque
demeanor jarred many on the staff.</TE>
<TE>   "His mistake was not building a coalition," said one former museum
director, who asked not to be identified. "Maybe imposing decisions
from the top works in a corporate setting, but not in academia. The
Smithsonian is like a university. You have to work with the faculty."</TE>
<TE>   A Natural History Museum scientist says research isn't Small's
priority. "The message we got was that he cared about bricks and
mortar and shiny buildings and lines around the block," said the
scientist, who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Discontent at the museums is now so great that his critics talk
with their doors open. "Dump Small" bumper stickers have been spotted
on the Mall, outside the Smithsonian's "Castle" headquarters.
Staffers gleefully log on to commercialalert.org, a Ralph Nader
production with a link to track the debate over Small's tenure.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the combatants argue, the battle for the heart, soul
and budget of the Smithsonian is all about mission. Does the
Smithsonian exist to educate or to entertain? Should it make
discoveries or profits?</TE>
<TE>   Or, perhaps, can it do it all?</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, James Smithson's $508,318.46 bequest was a
headache. The illegitimate son of a British duke, Smithson never
forgave his class-conscious country for its treatment of children
born out of wedlock. A scientist, he left his fortune to the people
of the United States, which he never actually visited, to fund "an
establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men."</TE>
<TE>   The first thing Congress did with the money was lose it. It
invested Smithson's bequest in bonds issued by the new states of
Michigan and Arkansas, which promptly defaulted. President Andrew
Jackson was inclined to write off the misfortune but Congressman John
Quincy Adams lobbied to make good the appropriation with taxpayer
funds. In 1846, the Smithsonian was born.</TE>
<TE>   The institution grew based on personal interests of the men at the
top--and major contributions. So many live animals were donated that
a zoo was started. A Detroit industrialist donated his American and
Oriental art, and presto, the Smithsonian had the Freer Gallery of
Art.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the only theme at the institution seems to have
been the marvel of eclectic discovery--its holdings add up to 142
million items and counting. It contains, for example, the world's
largest collection of primary source documents on the visual arts in
America. It owns Dolly Madison's dance slippers, the "cursed" Hope
diamond (which arrived by regular mail), and the Woolworth's lunch
counter where civil rights protesters demanded to be served in the
1960s. Among its science centers is the Smithsonian Environmental
Research Center, including 12 miles of undeveloped shoreline on the
Chesapeake Bay and a Tropical Research Center in Panama staffed by 30
scientists. All of which demonstrates that the question of mission
has long been thorny.</TE>
<TE>   S. Dillon Ripley, an ornithologist who served as secretary from
1964 to 1984, did more than any other to give the institution its
identity as a public attraction rather than an academic enclave. He
opened five new museums (including the Hirshorn Museum and Sculpture
Garden and the Air and Space Museum), put a carousel on the Mall and
opened the Smithsonian's doors to the public for free.</TE>
<TE>   To scientists and historians who had hitched their careers to the
Smithsonian's reputation for research, the trend was ominous.</TE>
<TE>   "Ripley's movement away from museums as repositories and toward
institutions of public education reduced support for the research
that makes possible the diffusion of knowledge," said Bill Fitzhugh,
a curator at the Natural History Museum and head of the Smithsonian's
Senate of Scientists.</TE>
<TE>   It also cost money. Since Ripley's tenure, the Smithsonian has
been searching for outside funds. For 2002, Congress will pay more
than 70% of the institution's $700-million-plus budget; the rest is
from interest on its endowment, profit from its restaurants,
bookstores and the like, and private and corporate donations and
deals.</TE>
<TE>   Well before Small's tenure, the trend toward commercialization
kicked in. In 1991, to up the corporate ante at the institution,
companies underwriting exhibits got their logos on brochures and text
panels. In 1992, for a gift of $500,000 from Orkin Pest Control, the
National Museum of Natural History named a permanent exhibit the O.
Orkin Insect Zoo.</TE>
<TE>   While such practices have become more and more common at museums
(not to mention ballparks), they earned special notice applied to the
Smithsonian. A group called the Center for the Study of Commercialism
protested: "With exhibits plugging products, parents ought to be
warned that the Smithsonian is looking more like Disney World."</TE>
<TE>   Still, in 1997, the Smithsonian announced it was curtailing the
schedule of its popular 150th anniversary touring show because of a
lack of funds. That very public embarrassment convinced the
Smithsonian's 17-member Board of Regents--headed by Supreme Court
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, and made up of senators,
congressmen, the vice president and several private citizens--that
they needed a businessman at the helm. They found Small.</TE>
<TE>   An amateur player of flamenco guitar and a collector of South
American tribal artifacts, as well as a high-level player in
financial institutions in Wall Street and Washington, Small wowed the
regents.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite amazing how strongly the search committee recommended
him," recalled Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), a member of the board.
"He was so sure this was a job he could do, and he could explain why.
It was very impressive."</TE>
<TE>   Within his first year at the Smithsonian, Small was aware that his
new colleagues weren't exactly thrilled with his goals.</TE>
<TE>   "People are not getting it," he lamented to one staffer. For
Small, said this source, "it was all a failure of communications.
That's his frame of mind."</TE>
<TE>   Small told associates he would just have to change the place
without them. He started with pandas. Hsing Hsing, the second of the
pair that China gave to President Nixon, had recently died, in
November 1999. Small said that everywhere he went, people asked him
when the zoo was going to get new pandas. To Small, spending money on
such a popular attraction was a no-brainer.</TE>
<TE>   But zoo director Mike Robinson thought it a dreadful waste to
spend millions on pandas instead of providing better facilities for
the animals already there.</TE>
<TE>   So Robinson, according to a source, told Small, "Over my dead
body." Small reportedly told associates, "We'll wait."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson retired in May 2000, telling associates he disagreed with
Small's priorities. At that point, the Smithsonian raised $13
million--mostly from Fuji Film--to pay the Chinese for new pandas. In
return, Fuji got a lot of positive publicity--plus the right to sell
film at Smithsonian shops. Attendance and purchases at the zoo's
restaurants and shops increased, according to zoo officials.</TE>
<TE>   Within the cluster of Smithsonian museums on the Mall, Small's
efforts to modernize were not unappreciated. "We know the roofs
leaked," one staffer said. Accounting and computer systems are
antiquated, and almost everyone agrees that static exhibits--objects
in glass cases, some unchanged in 40 years--are hardly the way to
attract today's audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Small quickly commissioned a report that found the Smithsonian's
400 buildings needed $1.5 billion in repairs. He also pressed for a
$40-million investment to update the management of the books. In both
cases, Congress told him to find the money elsewhere. That's when he
started looking for places to cut.</TE>
<TE>   He made a few that lasted: 200 people were fired from various
offices. He disbanded the Smithsonian film unit and its in-house
duplicating center, saying it would be cheaper to hire outside
printers.</TE>
<TE>   But he also went after research projects that he decided
duplicated efforts elsewhere. When he proposed closing the
institution's animal biodiversity facility, biologists and
environmentalists howled until Congress intervened, setting up a
panel of scientists to decide the issue. It is expected to complete
its report by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   Small also proposed cutting a unit in Suitland, Md., that helps
keep curators current on the latest research into preservation
methods for the collections. That talk stopped after Sept. 11, when
Wall Street firms called the unit to ask how to repair artwork
damaged at ground zero.</TE>
<TE>   As his cutbacks met with protests, Small moved to beef up the
profit side of the ledger--the Imax theaters, the gift shops, the
restaurants and Smithsonian magazine--hiring new managers to run
what's called Smithsonian Business Ventures. So far, with attendance
at all the Smithsonian's attractions plummeting after Sept. 11, these
ventures have made $16 million instead of the hoped-for $25 million
in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Small has pushed further than any other secretary when it comes to
courting private donors and corporate sponsors, raising nearly $400
million in his first two years. His biggest catch so far is Kenneth
Behring. The Northern California real estate developer had already
donated $20 million to the institution's National Museum of Natural
History when Small approached him late in 2000. Behring responded by
giving $80 million more to renovate the museum that now bears his
name--the National Museum of American History, Behring Center.</TE>
<TE>   If Behring was the high point in Small's fund-raising efforts,
Catherine Reynolds marked the low. Reynolds is a Washington
philanthropist whose foundation dispenses profits from a student loan
business she sold in 2000. She offered Small $38 million for an
exhibit at the American History Museum, a Hall of American Achievers
devoted to "life stories of eminent Americans," and she wanted to
choose 10 of the 15 committee members who would select the stories to
be celebrated. Pressed by a reporter to make some suggestions, she
did--Rosa Parks, Oprah Winfrey, Sam Donaldson, Martha Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   The history museum curators were outraged. Scholarship should
drive exhibits, not contributors. In editorials, they accused Small
of unethical relationships with large contributors. Scholars called
for his dismissal.  Critics said he should have steered Reynolds
toward funding Smithsonian priorities or stipulated that her proposal
would be referred to a panel of scholars for vetting.</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds withdrew her offer. In a letter to Small, Reynolds--who
has peaceably contributed to such institutions as the Kennedy Center
for the Performing Arts--cast the clash in ideological terms. She
wanted to honor "the power of the individual to make a difference,"
while the museum's staff believed that "only movements and
institutions make a difference." Small issued no response.</TE>
<TE>   The latest flap over the quid pro quo of big money donations and
tie-ins came in March. Steven F. Udar-Hazy, an L.A. airplane leasing
executive, has already donated $65 million for a new annex for the
Air and Space Museum that will bear his name. By all accounts, he is
what curators call a dream donor, eager to contribute to the funding
and planning, but happy to leave the decisions to the professionals.
Still, the museum is $96 million short for the annex; if a donor
comes forward, it has said, it is willing to change the name of the
Albert Einstein Planetarium.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Maurice Hinchey (D-N.Y.) scolded Small in a budget hearing
after the news broke. "You shouldn't be selling," Hinchey told him,
"and certainly not so cheaply."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the salvos at the Smithsonian, the Board of Regents has
maintained steadfast support of Small.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been working hard to manage the institution--and it has so
many disparate parts," said Sen. Cochran, a board member. "Somebody
has to be tough enough to do all these things and deal with the
necessary controversies. The so-called scholars have all decided he
needs to go. They are entitled to their opinion, but I expect he's
not gonna go."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, in their latest meeting, in early May, the board once
again showed no sign of wavering in its commitment to "modernization
and money." But it did offer some comfort to Small's critics.</TE>
<TE>   The regents endorsed a yearlong blue-ribbon study on how to
reorganize the American History Museum, prompted by Behring's
generosity. The report chided Small for allowing corporate and
private donors to dictate content or brand the exhibits. "There are
lines beyond which gifts said to be charitable in their motivation
look more ... like promotion and advertising," it said, urging the
Smithsonian to resist this tendency, not just to preserve its
credibility, but also to "increase the prestige value of sponsors'
discrete association with the museum."</TE>
<TE>   But the report also reminded the staff that "the museum does not
have a monopoly on good ideas." It called for more diversity in
content and presentation, more coherence in its overall organization
and an overhaul of the building's design.</TE>
<TE>   "The curators will prevail on content," Cochran said, insisting
the regents won't let the Smithsonian to become Disney World--the
carousel on the Mall, he said, "is as far as we're going to go."</TE>
<TE>   The curators worry still. "In 20 years," prophesies Barney Finn,
one of 35 curators at the American History Museum, "they will place
the curators with showmen. Some more jaundiced than I think it will
be sooner than that."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the war continues.</TE>

<DH>Unlike giants of the theater, these playwrights deserve
praise simply for working year in and year out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVEN OXMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are annual plants and perennial plants. Annual plants blossom
beautifully ... once. Then they need to be replaced. Perennial plants
might not bloom as spectacularly, but they return season after
season.</LD>
<LD>   As it is with botany, so it can be with playwrights.</LD>
<LD>   The perfect playwriting example of the annual variety is Margaret
Edson, who wrote the stunning "Wit," took home the Pulitzer Prize,
and decided that she would write another play only when she felt it
was in her, when there was something she was driven to write. Until
then, she happily returned to teaching kindergarten in Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   Then there are the stalwarts, the playwrights who, against all
odds, keep delivering plays over the course of decades, but because
of their ubiquity can often be taken for granted. It's time to stop
and smell the roses of a few representatives of this variety, who've
been around an awfully long time, have gone in and out of fashion,
and, if one cares to notice, have been populating the local theater
scene of late: Horton Foote, A.R. Gurney Jr. and Terrence McNally.</TE>
<TE>   Let's call them the perennial American playwrights.</TE>
<TE>   International perennials--the Athol Fugards, the David Hares--are
plentiful; domestic ones rarer. It's not really hard to understand,
given the big-time temptations (or, depending on one's point of view,
opportunities) that face playwrights who achieve fame in America.</TE>
<TE>   Arguably, America's two leading playwrights of the '70s and '80s
are busy now primarily with other endeavors. Sam Shepard, the
off-Broadway artiste, has become a film actor, appearing frequently
in TV movies, turning out a short play every five years or so--if
we're lucky. David Mamet has become a Hollywood auteur
writer-director and screenplay surgeon. He most recently wrote and
directed the films "State and Main" and "The Heist." Before his play
"Boston Marriage," which premiered in Cambridge, Mass., in 1999, his
last stage work was ... could it have been "The Cryptogram," a
one-act from way back in 1994?</TE>
<TE>   Now, I'm an admirer of both writers, and they can hardly be blamed
for being drawn to forms with larger audiences, or in Shepard's case,
less wearing occupations. But they serve to demonstrate how rare the
perennial really is.</TE>
<TE>   The writers who've never stopped regularly, almost rhythmically,
writing plays, even if--especially if--they never achieved quite the
same degree of fame as Mamet or other perennials like Neil Simon,
August Wilson or Edward Albee, deserve serious credit. For not being
distracted more than momentarily by film and television. For not even
being distracted by a need to direct their own plays. For being
playwrights in a culture that treats the profession most often as a
steppingstone to something else. For defining their careers--and
their lives--by the fact that they write plays.</TE>
<TE>   That's what they do--that's who they are. That's why they define
the perennial playwright in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Foote, Gurney and McNally have all been around a long time, but
they're hardly household names. They're the playwriting equivalent of
the character actor one sees in the supermarket--they seem familiar,
but what did they write?</TE>
<TE>   So one might be surprised that each has been produced at least
twice at prominent institutions in Southern California in the last
year. "Pete" Gurney's "Far East" was just staged at Laguna Playhouse,
and his "Ancestral Voices" was recorded by L.A. Theatre Works about
18 months after it was performed by a name cast at the Falcon Theatre
in Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   McNally has been represented by his librettos for "The Full Monty"
at the Ahmanson and for the opera version of "Dead Man Walking" in
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Foote's recently staged work in Southern California includes the
South Coast Repertory world premiere run of "Getting Frankie
Married--and Afterwards," as well as a revival at El Portal of his
1995 Pulitzer-winning "The Young Man From Atlanta."</TE>
<TE>   Taken together, these three writers have composed well over 100
plays--if you count their early, short plays, probably more than 150.
They've had hits ... and misses. They didn't arrive at theatrical
prominence from Day One, but came to be known after writing many
plays.</TE>
<TE>   Gurney wrote his first full-length, "Scenes From American Life,"
in 1970, but assured a career with "The Dining Room" in 1982, which
ran off-Broadway for a year and a half. (In the middle of that time,
his 1977 play "The Middle Ages" received its premiere at the Taper
Lab.) McNally had been writing plays for more than 20 years before
"Frankie and Johnnie at the Claire de Lune" in 1987 made him a known
quantity.</TE>
<TE>   Foote is the standard bearer of the perennials. A native of
Wharton, Texas--the inspiration for the fictional town of Harrison
where he sets most of his work--Foote was an aspiring actor who
studied at the Pasadena Playhouse in its Depression-era heyday before
turning his attention to writing. He won an Oscar for his 1962
adaptation of "To Kill a Mockingbird," and he's returned on occasion
to screenwriting--he won another Oscar for "Tender Mercies" in 1983,
and in 1997, adapted Faulkner's "Old Man" for Hallmark and CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Foote's a man whose plays emanate a simple wisdom, and when he's
interviewed, he never makes broad, abstract comments, but
straightforward ones that seem overly obvious but really aren't.
"Keeping an unpublished manuscript in a drawer," Foote has said, "and
not sharing it with an audience, even if it is a small audience of
friends and acquaintances, is a mistake." He seems to enjoy spreading
his seeds around the American theater, allowing obscure houses like
the Bay Street Theatre in Sag Harbor, N.Y., or the Silver Spring
Stage in Maryland, to mount premiere productions of "A Coffin in
Egypt" and "The Day Emily Married," respectively.</TE>
<TE>   At 86, he's only a year younger than Arthur Miller, who stopped
sprouting plays a long time ago--and still, South Coast Rep's
artistic director, Martin Benson, admitted that he had "overlooked"
Foote until he got a copy of "Getting Frankie Married."</TE>
<TE>   Why are these writers sometimes overlooked? Because, to be frank,
they're not "important" playwrights. Let's face it: These are not the
first writers chosen for college curricula on 20th century drama, or
even American drama. They are unafraid of the sentimental and
ill-disposed to the cynical--a combination that makes them highly
un-hip. They tend not to write about "big ideas." They generally
aren't formally innovative. They don't redefine what the theater is
or can be, or experiment with lingual gymnastics.</TE>
<TE>   Gurney is the most playful of them, looking for different types of
theatricality in which to express his stories. For "Far East," he
incorporates Asian theatrical devices into his tale; in "The Dining
Room," a small cast plays a host of characters; "Sweet Sue" uses two
actors for each role. Still, though, there's often something
self-conscious about the effort. It's the simplicity of his
storytelling that saves the day from his labored formal premises.</TE>
<TE>   Foote and McNally are almost always straightforward--realistic,
with touches, rather than flourishes, of theatricality. McNally likes
to create visual tableaux, at the beginning and end of "Lips
Together, Teeth Apart," for example, that create an emotional chord
in lieu of a traditional climax. Foote's language is so basic it's
beautiful; his characters reminisce abundantly, and his most
theatrical tool is the long monologue.</TE>
<TE>   Such writers deserve praise not because they're visionary
architects, but because they are skilled, intricate bricklayers.
They're craftsmen, first and foremost. They plug away at their work
with good days and bad days, good plays and bad plays. And when a
craftsman does that over a period of years, something happens. Even
his least inspired work develops a refined polish that the flashiest
of annual playwrights can't touch.</TE>
<TE>   We can see the elegant ease of the craftsman in the way "Far East"
and "Getting Frankie Married" move from scene to scene. "Ancestral
Voices" provides a smooth example of this skill in the subtle way
Gurney keeps track of time: World War II, at the start of the play a
far-away conflict in Europe, gradually intrudes more and more into
the conversation even though it has little direct effect on the plot.</TE>
<TE>   And notice what McNally has done with "The Full Monty." He took a
screenplay that was the essence of English independent film
sensibility and transformed it into pure American musical comedy.
It's broad and brash--the tone and the style are wholly different
from the film, and yet the story remains fundamentally intact. That's
a difficult type of craft--to change something utterly while also
leaving it the same.</TE>
<TE>   As skilled craftsmen, these writers also know it's not enough to
write characters--one must write roles. Great roles make for great
performances. Robert Duvall won an Oscar for "Tender Mercies" (1983),
and Geraldine Page won one for Foote's 1985 film adaptation of his
play "The Trip to Bountiful."</TE>
<TE>   Neither of these characters could match the sheer bravado of
McNally's bold Maria Callas in 1995's "Master Class," played to the
Tony-winning hilt by Zoe Caldwell in a production that broke box
office records at the Mark Taper Forum on its way to Broadway. With
Gurney's "Sylvia," what actress worth her salt wouldn't jump at the
opportunity to give voice to a friendly canine? In 1995, a vintage
year for the perennials, Sarah Jessica Parker played the role in New
York. There wouldn't be room to list the famous thespians who've
played in Gurney's epistolary "Love Letters," which allowed for
rotating celebrity casts.</TE>
<TE>   Even roles, though, are insufficient. Characters can't operate in
a vacuum. They need relationships, and so many of the perennials'
plays derive their plots not from big events, but from small changes
in relationships</TE>
<TE>   The biggest challenge of being a perennial playwright: finding
material. For the first dozen plays, that might be easy enough, but
how about the third dozen? While all of these writers have done
literary adaptations at one time or another, they have mostly mined
highly personal territory for their work.</TE>
<TE>   Taking all of Foote's plays about Harrison together, we have a
complete picture of small-town Texas, from the influenza epidemic to
the age of Ronald Reagan. Gurney has given voice to the fading WASP
culture of Buffalo throughout his career, writing small romantic
comedies or light family sagas all set in this milieu. Even "Far
East," which takes place in 1950s Japan, is really about the values
of the WASP culture, particularly its racial bigotry.</TE>
<TE>   McNally's passion for opera has inspired plenty of material. In
"The Lisbon Traviata," he crafted a character defined by his
adoration of Maria Callas, later portraying Callas herself in "Master
Class." His way with show-biz types infuses "The Full Monty" too: He
added the jokey pianist, played by Carol Woods at the Ahmanson, a
character who becomes an instant audience favorite.</TE>
<TE>   It's the way they are able to explore their lives, their
upbringing, their ancestors and contemporaries from endless angles
that makes the perennials' prolific writing possible. They don't
write about themselves so much as they write from themselves.</TE>
<TE>   One could select a play or two from each of these writers to get a
sense of his talent, but it's not talent that truly sets them apart.
In the end, what makes these playwrights so invaluable is the very
fact that they perennate despite the commercial climate or the often
rocky condition of the theatrical soil.</TE>

<HD>A Tale of Two Tryouts</HD>
<DH>Tony nominees 'Millie' and 'Sweet Smell of Success' have
been changed--not always for the better</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL PHILLIPS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The phrase "out-of-town tryout" evokes images of a train chugging
into Philly, Boston or Baltimore, loaded with show folk, most of them
smoking. Over here, the writers rewrite like maniacs; over there, in
the bar car, the composer engages in frantic discourse with the
piano--did bar cars really have pianos?--while the dance director
hammers out a new step surrounded by performers wondering if this
musical's going to fly after all.</LD>
<LD>   Tryouts no longer work that way, if, in fact, they ever resembled
the Broadway mythology reinforced by movies like "42nd Street" and
"The Band Wagon." Air travel lacks the glamour of train travel. The
phrase "not-for-profit regional theater" doesn't sing like
"out-of-town tryout." More and more Broadway-minded musicals begin
their lives at a nonprofit stage a time zone or two away from Shubert
Alley.</LD>
<LD>   Even now, however, seeing a musical in its embryonic form remains
one of show-going's great privileges. A tryout represents the start
of something potentially big, perhaps even as large as last year's
Chicago premiere of "The Producers."</LD>
<TE>   We must remember, however, that "The Producers" does not happen
every year. That much has been made clear by the current, dispiriting
Broadway season.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, the 56th annual Tony Awards will put as happy a face as
it can on the 2001-02 Broadway lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the most heavily nominated musicals--"Thoroughly Modern
Millie," tonight's likely big winner (it has 11 nominations), and
"Sweet Smell of Success" (seven nominations)--illustrate two markedly
contrasting tryout tales. The moral of "Thoroughly Modern Millie": Do
not throw the baby out with the rewrites. The moral of "Sweet Smell
of Success": Don't be afraid to start over, or nearly.</TE>
<TE>   "Thoroughly Modern Millie," based on the 1967 film, tried out in
the fall of 2000 at the La Jolla Playhouse. I saw it there, then I
saw the heavily revised edition last month in New York. And I have
never seen a promising show go south so badly from tryout to
Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   In La Jolla, "Millie" had a relaxed comic spirit. Its silliness
didn't feel leaden; it was buoyant. True, the show didn't yet have an
ending, and the score was all over the place, veering from new
material (by composer Jeanine Tesori and lyricist Dick Scanlan) to
songs from the film to period artifacts revised. But its problems
were fixable.</TE>
<TE>   Encouraged by the La Jolla reception, the creative team went to
work and apparently couldn't stop from futzing with every single
element, even the elements that worked. The Broadway "Millie"
features eight new songs, as well as a greatly expanded, spanking new
and plug-ugly design scheme, selling fantasy Futurist images of
Manhattan. In the title tune, and the most fetching new ditty,
"Forget About the Boy," the new orchestrations and arrangements sound
labored, fussy and restless. The key changes come willy-nilly, and
neither tune lands as well as it did in the tryout.</TE>
<TE>   In story terms, the flapper Millie bends over backward to clarify
what show people love to call the heroine's "journey." Now, Millie
has a big moment in a new song ("Not for the Life of Me") early on,
in which she gambles everything on little ol' New York by defiantly
tearing up her one-way ticket back to Palookaville. The way Sutton
Foster delivers it, it's the eat-'em-alive 11 o'clock number--and
look at the time! It's only 8:13!</TE>
<TE>   Right away you know something has happened to Foster's
performance. By the time she tackles the actual 11 o'clock star solo,
"Gimme Gimme," it's as if the song were called "Gimme Gimme Gimme
That Tony." And if Foster wins one tonight, the Tony committee may
have to consider changing "best actress" to "most actress."</TE>
<TE>   What happened? Director Michael Mayer and company, I suspect,
decided that in the wake of Sept. 11, the show really was about New
York as fantasy island, the isle of dreams and reinvention--Oz,
though an utterly charmless one.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with "Millie," the saga of "Sweet Smell of Success" is
more modest. In the wake of its indifferently received Chicago
tryout, the show has improved somewhat. The musical, based on the
incomparable 1957 film about a vicious gossip columnist and a
barnacle of a press agent, now has a sharper opening number, one less
egregious ballad for the overexposed young lovers, a less messy and
more satisfying ending. These changes, by director Nicholas Hytner
and his team, are all to the betterment of the show.</TE>
<TE>   But the changes are more cosmetic than organic, and they're not
enough. The overriding problem of tone hasn't been solved. "Sweet
Smell" plays nice and easy when it should play rough. It's not nasty
enough to please the aficionados of truly dangerous musicals, and
it's not exhilarating enough in its showbizziness to wallop the
Wednesday matinee crowd. The shifts in storytelling emphasis make
little sense. Why does Hunsecker, valiantly portrayed by John
Lithgow, take the weaselly Falco (Brian d'Arcy James) under his wing?
Who knows? What are we supposed to make of Falco's "I-want" biggie,
"At the Fountain"? Who can say? Why wasn't Jack Noseworthy (as the
hipster jazz pianist Steve Dallas) replaced by somebody better?</TE>
<TE>   The wrapping looks better, but the candy underneath remains as it
was in Chicago: soft.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with tonal uncertainties such as "Sweet Smell" and the
half-spoofy, half-sincere "Millie," another best musical Tony
nominee, "Urinetown"--10 nominations in all--stands out as a triumph
of deadpan certainty. (The fourth Tony-nominated new musical, "Mamma
Mia!," stands out primarily as a triumph of ABBA.)</TE>
<TE>   A Brecht-and-Weill goof set in a metropolis where you have to pay
to pee, "Urinetown" was written by Mark Hollmann (music and lyrics)
and Greg Kotis (book and lyrics). It had its tryout of sorts at the
1999 N.Y. International Fringe Festival. The Broadway version
represents an entirely new staging, a wholesale recasting and a merry
instance of a one-joke show being told so brilliantly, one's quite
enough.</TE>
<TE>   Tony-wise, "Urinetown" has slimmish chances up against the
aggressive I Love New York campaign that is "Millie." I missed
"Urinetown" in its earlier incarnation. But judging from the Broadway
edition, director John Rando and his partners in parodic crime have
made some exceptionally shrewd decisions in assessing the material's
comic strengths.</TE>
<TE>   In Chicago, the next year's worth of out-of-town tryouts include
two tantalizing prospects. Later this month, the Twyla Tharp/Billy
Joel dance musical "Movin' Out" begins a commercial pre-Broadway
engagement. Already the show's New York opening has been set for Oct.
24. And next June, the Stephen Sondheim/John Weidman musical comedy
"Gold!" opens at the Goodman Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle, meanwhile, is reportedly about to open its first official
commercial Broadway-bound tryout. Now in previews, "Hairspray," at
$10 million, is squarely in the "Millie" range, and staged by Jack
O'Brien, San Diego's Globe Theatres artistic director. New York is
already buzzing with promising word of mouth about the stage version
of the 1988 John Waters film, featuring music by Marc Shaiman (the
movie "South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut"). That's how New York is:
The vultures are always circling, but you can spy the occasional
bluebird of optimism.</TE>
<TE>   From there, who knows?</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, a once-in-a-decade hit such as "The Producers"
probably could have opened cold in New York, thereby saving $1.5
million in tryout costs. But that's why you take a show out of
town-so you can later say, "Well, in retrospect...."</TE>
<TE>   And then the real work begins.</TE>

<HD>Beck Readies an Artistic Statement of an Album</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beck doesn't have a title for his next album yet, but to hear the
people working with him talk, it might as well be called "Career
Record." That was the phrase used a lot when the mercurial musician
recently played the album, tentatively due Sept. 24, for a small
group of Interscope Records executives, other business associates,
musicians, friends and family members.</LD>
<LD>   Reteaming him with Nigel Godrich, producer of 1998's "Mutations,"
the record is a fairly somber set of songs. At times it recalls such
models as early Neil Young and Jimmy Webb, several of the tracks
featuring colorfully swirling, almost psychedelic orchestral settings
overseen by the singer's father, arranger David Campbell.</LD>
<LD>   It's miles away from the wry pop-culture explosions of such Beck
hits as "Where It's At" and "New Pollution." Although "Mutations" had
a somewhat similar aesthetic, that album was presented as a side
trip. This one is being positioned as an artistic statement,
affirming Beck as someone who should be measured by his long-term
creative output, not by sales of individual albums or singles.</LD>
<TE>   That's a key strategy, considering that after U.S. sales of more
than 2 million for 1996's "Odelay," the lightly promoted "Mutations"
and 1999's more heavily pushed "Midnite Vultures" fell far short of
that bar, selling 530,000 and 660,000, respectively. Neither Beck nor
Interscope expects the new album to take him back to "Odelay" levels.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm no dummy," he says. "I listen to the radio all the time and
know what's on there. There was no attempt to fit in and do something
within the context of what's there. But I think it's obvious that
I've never catered to radio or anything, never catered to the
commercial aspects of the music business."</TE>
<TE>   Interscope President Mark Williams is thrilled with the album.
"This shows that Beck's a significant artist and will be for many
years," he says. "We'll just have to be creative [in promoting the
album]. It's a good kind of challenge."</TE>
<TE>   For some time following "Midnite Vultures," though, it was
uncertain what kind of album Beck would do next.</TE>
<TE>   He regularly remarked that he had as many as seven albums
gestating, with styles ranging from acoustic country to rock to
hip-hop. He also spent time in the last two years on a variety of
collaborations, including work with hip-hop auteur Timbaland (on a
version of David Bowie's "Diamond Dogs" for the "Moulin Rouge"
soundtrack) and singer Marianne Faithfull (two songs on her upcoming
album).</TE>
<TE>   But more and more he found himself wanting to work again with
Godrich, famed for producing Radiohead's "OK Computer," "Kid A" and
"Amnesiac," although finding a time when their schedules aligned
proved difficult. They finally blocked out a stretch earlier this
year, and Beck focused on a side of his creativity he felt he'd
somewhat neglected.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a lover of songwriting and song craft," he says. "And I'm
always honing that in my spare time, so to speak--which is funny.
It's almost as if songwriting is my hobby, the thing that comes last,
and when I get to do it, I love exploring and simplifying and
becoming more articulate with what I express. This record would be a
fruition of a good amount of work.</TE>
<TE>   "The aesthetic on this record is deliberate," he says. "It's half
Nigel and half me. It's different from what people probably expect or
are accustomed to hearing. The material goes into that
singer-songwriter area where it could almost go middle of the road,
but keeps its edge.</TE>
<TE>   "Those records are so great that have that certain mood and take
you into a terrain, great early-'70s albums, [Joni Mitchell's] 'Blue'
and [Neil Young's] 'Harvest.' You know you can put them on and go
into that space."</TE>
<TE>   ZIGGY ZAGS: Ziggy Marley has rarely stuck to a strict reggae
formula in his work with the Melody Makers, the group that also
features his brother Stephen and sisters Cedella and Sharon. But for
his next album, this son of Bob Marley is taking a radical turn.</TE>
<TE>   Working without his siblings for the first time, he enlisted rock
producer Scott Litt and is exploring some new territory, with Flea of
the Red Hot Chili Peppers playing bass on most songs and guitarist
Mike Einziger and DJ Kilmore of Incubus contributing to recent
sessions at a Beverly Hills studio.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more rock, not refined--pretty raw," Ziggy Marley says.
"This album will be surprising to a lot of people, especially those
who still think of me as sounding like Bob Marley. There's a song on
the album called 'I Get Out,' and that's what the song is saying--I
will get out of the boxes people put me in. I want to mess with
people's minds sometimes.</TE>
<TE>   "Even my own people, Jamaicans, sometimes they don't like when I
do different things. The roots of my stuff is reggae, my tradition.
But I remember when that was new music, it was different stuff."</TE>
<TE>   The album is due Aug. 27, the first for Marley under a new
contract with RCA/Victor. He'll be previewing some of the new
material while on tour as part of a package that includes Sheryl Crow
and Train in July and August. The tour stops July 27 at the Verizon
Wireless Amphitheater in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: "Higher Ground," the Blind Boys of Alabama follow-up
to the gospel Grammy-winning "Spirit of the Century," is now set for
a Sept. 3 release, and features versions of Prince's "The Cross," Ben
Harper's "I Shall Not Walk Alone," the Aretha Franklin song "Spirit
in the Dark" and, of course, Stevie Wonder's "Higher Ground." ...
Punk Rock Aerobics (the name explains it all) is trying something a
little bit different with its June 29 class in New York--the Blue Man
Group will be guest DJs. The venture is exploring expansion and
developing plans for a DVD home workout program.... Pulp's "We Love
Life," released late last year in England, is getting a belated U.S.
issue from Sanctuary Records in late July.... Julee Cruise, the
haunting musical voice of "Twin Peaks," is back with a new album,
"The Art of Being a Girl." ... Kathy Mattea has veered from country
to favor folk styles with some Celtic filigree on "Roses," her first
for the Narada label, due July 30. Kim Richey and Beth Neilsen
Chapman each wrote songs specifically for the album.</TE>

<HD>Up Against a Wall of Sorrows, Los Lobos Seeks Their Roots</HD>

<LD>   LOS LOBOS</LD>
<LD>   "Good Morning Aztlan"</LD>
<TE>   Mammoth</TE>
<TE>   There's a darkness around the edges of Los Lobos' eighth
major-label album, a sometimes elusive but always unmistakable
presence, in an overtone of David Hidalgo's soulful vocals, or in a
discord among the guitars. It even lurks in the record's many bright,
upbeat moments. That's what can happen when you're committed to
charting the human condition with an unflinching eye.</TE>
<TE>   Los Lobos has never failed in that mission and in "Good Morning
Aztlan," the quintet from East Los Angeles comes up against a
potentially dispiriting wall of sorrows. When you listen to the lyric
of "Luz de Mi Vida"--"Light of my life / You are the voice of my son
/ You are forever"--it's impossible not to think of the murder of
singer-guitarist Cesar Rosas' wife last year and to partake in his
grief.</TE>
<TE>   A lover isn't the only loss. There's an immigrant's dreams,
nature, and the old ways that comforted and sustained a community in
a hostile world. The album's detailed depictions of that life--the
banter of ranch workers, the sights and smells of a
neighborhood--carry a palpable warmth and affection</TE>
<TE>   As if gearing up to cope with the uncertainty in the air, Los
Lobos (which plays Amoeba Music in Hollywood on Tuesday, the day of
the album's release, and the House of Blues in West Hollywood on
Saturday) shelves the sonic experimentation and studio abstraction of
their last few English-language albums and returns to its role as an
earthy, live band, one steeped in classic soul and rock signatures
ranging from Curtis Mayfield to Santana to the Band.</TE>
<TE>   The five players form an offhandedly virtuosic unit, manipulating
massive musical shapes with the exhilarating ease of an orchestra,
yet in essence never seeming like anything but a bar band.</TE>
<TE>   This is music armed for battle, gathering all its strength and
spirit to resist the drag of a heavy heart.</TE>
<TE>   --Richard Cromelin</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   MESHELL NDEGEOCELLO</TE>
<TE>   "Cookie:</TE>
<TE>   The Anthropological Mixtape"</TE>
<TE>   Maverick</TE>
<TE>   "Just cuz civil rights is law doesn't mean that we all abide /
Tell me are you free?" Ndegeocello asks in the opening track of her
fourth album (in stores Tuesday)--a striking return to her early role
of revolutionary soul singer after focusing chiefly on the ups and
downs of romantic relationships in her last album, 1999's "Bitter."</TE>
<TE>   The singer-songwriter-bassist even employs the term "revolutionary
soul singer" in the album's second track, "Hot Night," whose
aggressive R&amp;B/funk tone also recalls her early work, which was a
pioneering step in the neo-soul movement that has given us Lauryn
Hill and Alicia Keys.</TE>
<TE>   At her best, in fact, Ndegeocello (pronounced N-day-gay-O-chello)
is the most political of the '90s crop of neo-soul singers, someone
who speaks passionately about politics on various levels--sexual,
social, racial and economic.</TE>
<TE>   There is much to admire in these tracks, whether Ndegeocello
assumes the role of political orator, questions her own faith (the
spiritually charged "Jabril") or takes us into a sensual world of
private passions ("Barry Farms" and "Trust"). There is a tension and
urgency in these moments that is as gripping as pop music gets.</TE>
<TE>   If Ndegeocello, who will be at the Roxy in West Hollywood on
Tuesday and Wednesday, had limited the album to, say, 50 minutes, she
would have had her fourth straight four-star collection. But the
consistency of the 70-odd minute album is broken by tracks--including
the cosmic, new age "Earth" and "Better by the Pound"--that lack the
absorbing edge that makes Ndegeocello such a rare and valuable
talent.</TE>
<TE>   --Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   ***1/2</TE>
<TE>   DOVES</TE>
<TE>   "The Last Broadcast"</TE>
<TE>   Capitol</TE>
<TE>   With their 2000 debut, "Lost Souls," Doves ranked among the most
accomplished and promising of the new British pop acts, and brothers
Jez and Andy Williams and Jimi Goodwin (sharing writing, instrumental
and vocal duties) make good on that promise here. "The Last
Broadcast" (in stores Tuesday) is as readily appealing as it is
unabashedly ambitious, taking broad cues from other British Isles
acts that have managed that balance, yet rarely sounding derivative.</TE>
<TE>   Themes of faith and perseverance against the darkness are set in
music of grandeur and invention with an artistic scope reminiscent of
U2--"Satellites" elevates with a gospel tone somewhere between the
Irish band and England's Spiritualized. Other comparisons can be made
to Radiohead (with more warmth), Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, and even King
Crimson and the Moody Blues in some of the distinctively lush touches
("M62 Song" is actually an adaptation of the early Crimson ballad
"Moonchild").</TE>
<TE>   There's majesty in the textural shifts of "Where We're Calling
From," and the rueful tone of "Friday's Dust" is given depth and
dimension by a captivatingly original orchestration.</TE>
<TE>   The most immediate songs, "Words" and "There Goes the Fear," are
pop gems of deceptive directness, the latter pitting its optimistic
lyrics, tinkling keyboards and hum-along choruses against an
underlying sense that fear never goes.</TE>
<TE>   The group plays L.A.'s Mayan Theatre on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Hochman.</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   **1/2 Thalia, "Thalia," EMI Latin. You know her as the pretty face
of the new Dr. Pepper commercial, or as the current Mrs. Tommy
Mottola, wife of Sony Music's chairman. To Latin fans, she's the cute
teenybopper-turned-soap opera star. As a pop vocalist, however,
Thalia has struggled to find an identity. Her last banda album was a
commercial disappointment. This upbeat effort, produced by hot
songwriter Estefano, projects a polished, snappy self-confidence that
could boost her English crossover aspirations. It's urban and
contemporary, filled with snazzy studio sound effects, tempting dance
rhythms and playful, even clever lyrics. Not profound or memorable,
but fun for the moment--like a Dr. Pepper commercial.</TE>
<TE>   --Agustin Gurza</TE>
<TE>   **1/2 Phil Lesh &amp; Friends, "There and Back Again," Columbia. The
Grateful Dead bassist's first album with his own group is colored by
his 1998 liver transplant as well as by Jerry Garcia's 1995 death.
The best songs, all written or co-written by Lesh with Dead lyricist
Robert Hunter, extol simple pleasures ("Celebration"), living life to
the fullest (the ebullient "Night of a Thousand Stars") and mortality
("No More Do I"). But Lesh, neither a prolific writer nor notable
singer, relies too much on his friends, most prominently
singer-guitarist Warren Haynes of Gov't Mule. And "Liberty," a 1988
Garcia-Hunter number, is among their most banal.</TE>
<TE>   --S.H.</TE>
<TE>   ** Cam'ron, "Come Home With Me," Roc-A-Fella/Def Jam. The smash
single "Oh Boy" has resurrected the career of this talented Harlem
rapper, whose hip-hop status had slipped recently. But that thumping
song stands as the only superior moment on Cam'ron's third album. The
collection's 14 other tracks are bogged down by unimaginative
variations of such street-life staples as guns, drugs and flashy
accouterments, as well as by middle-of-the-road beats.</TE>

three stars (good) and four stars (excellent). The albums are already

<HD>China's Latest Greatest-Hits Collection</HD>
<DH>The Bowers Museum builds on its Far East link with a show
of over 250 treasures from the Nanjing Museum</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One blockbuster success deserves another, and the Bowers Museum of
Cultural Art in Santa Ana is hoping that its newest exhibition from
China will rival that of "The Secret World of the Forbidden City"
mounted two years ago. That show pulled in 250,000 visitors during
its seven-month stay--twice the usual number of visitors to the
Bowers in a year.</LD>
<LD>   "We found a tremendous amount of interest sparked by the Forbidden
City exhibit," museum President Peter Keller says, "and that was just
a small window of the Qing Dynasty [1644-1911]. The Chinese have such
a tremendously rich history going back to the Neolithic."</LD>
<LD>   So now there's "Symbols of Power: Masterpieces From the Nanjing
Museum," culled from 440,000 objects in China's second largest
museum. This is the Nanjing Museum's first foray in the Americas--it
has sent a limited number of shows to parts of Asia and Europe. It is
also its largest loan--more than 250 objects--inside or outside
China.</LD>
<TE>   Like the Forbidden City exhibition, "Symbols of Power" offers a
capsule version of Chinese cultural history, a greatest-hits sampler.
It encompasses 5,000 years of artifacts and artworks--from terra
cotta figurines to embroideries, jade to bronze, lacquerware to
porcelain, paintings to crafted curiosities.</TE>
<TE>   Nanjing is a city of 5.3 million that lies inland from Shanghai on
the Yangtze River. Its name means "southern capital" (Beijing means
"northern capital"). The museum, founded in 1933, is best known for
its strong archeology department, with objects excavated from areas
in Jiangsu, Shandong and Zhejiang provinces that are especially rich
in tomb sites. About half of the material in the Bowers exhibition
comes from such excavations.</TE>
<TE>   The rest represents another important Nanjing holding, the
contents of 2,200 crates of treasures accumulated by the imperial
court, primarily during the Qing Dynasty. The crates were among
20,000 packed up at the National Palace Museum in Beijing in the
1930s, at the start of the Sino-Japanese War.</TE>
<TE>   Moved around the country to avoid damage or confiscation during
that war and the civil war that followed, some of the crates ended up
in Taiwan in 1949 with Chiang Kai-shek and his followers. Among the
crates left behind, 15,000 went to Beijing, and 2,200 remained in
Nanjing.</TE>
<TE>   In December, The Times reported that the Palace Museum in Beijing
claimed ownership of the Nanjing crates and their contents. Officials
there were demanding that the material be returned to them. According
to Li Minchang, one of three Nanjing curators who have come to Santa
Ana to install the "Symbols of Power" exhibition, that controversy
was recently settled. The central government, he said, had asserted
control over the material; some pieces may be moved to the Palace
Museum in Beijing, but most of the objects will remain in Nanjing.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, Xu Huping, director of the Nanjing Museum, is curator
of the Bowers show, but Anne Shih, a member of the Bowers' board,
traveled to China to work with Xu, taking an active hand in
suggesting works to be lent."Mrs. Shih was very persuasive," says Li,
as he leads a visitor on a tour through the galleries where the show
is being installed.</TE>
<TE>   Among the palace material, a map and a set of devotional Buddhist
figurines have pride of place in the exhibition. The map is a copy of
an original made by Matteo Ricci, an Italian Jesuit priest who lived
in China from 1583 to 1610. The map must have been a revelation to
the Chinese, who, unlike contemporary European powers, were not known
for maritime exploration. Only two copies of this map remain (the
other is in a museum in Liaoning Province), and this one, in color on
six paper panels, was made by Imperial Palace eunuchs in 1608.</TE>
<TE>   "To flatter the emperor," Li says, "Ricci put China in the center
of the map."</TE>
<TE>   In the first gallery, one Buddha and 49 bodhisattvas and other
figures are arranged by size and type. Made of gilt bronze, they date
to the Qing Dynasty, the last imperial occupants of the Forbidden
City. The Qings were Manchus, an ethnic group from northwest China,
and they favored Buddhism with a Tibetan turn, which is apparent in
the specific deities represented and in details of poses and facial
features.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not really a set," says Li, an archeologist by training.</TE>
<TE>   "They were from different altars in the Imperial Palace" in
Beijing, says Ling Bo, Nanjing Museum's director of collections who's
also in Santa Ana to set up the exhibition. In Nanjing, the figures
have never been on public display.</TE>
<TE>   One section of the exhibition is devoted to archeological finds,
chief among them a complete jade shroud from a royal or noble tomb
that dates to the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220).  One of only a dozen
or so in existence, the shroud is made of more than 200 jade tiles,
perforated on the corners and held together by silver wire.</TE>
<TE>   Several objects in the exhibition were found at one major tomb
excavation in Lianshui, Jiangsu Province, in 1965. In the past, the
wealthy and powerful were buried with everything they would require
in the afterlife. The exhibition includes, for example, a bronze
model of a chariot, with two horses and a driver, from the Warring
States period (481-221 BC), meant to provide transport in the
hereafter.</TE>
<TE>   More than half of the Bowers exhibition features objects from
imperial and noble households--embroidered emperors' dragon robes and
empresses' tunics, ceramic bowls and vessels from the Song to the
Qing periods; intricately carved red lacquerware, and a number of art
objects that reflect the Qing taste for the highly decorative. For
example, a solid-gold cicada on a leaf carved out of translucent
white jade--just over 2 inches long.</TE>
<TE>   Also here are several scrolls that look to have been painted but
on closer examination are revealed to be laboriously embroidered or
woven. An embroidered portrait of Guanyin, the Buddhist goddess of
mercy, by Lady Guan Zhongji dates from the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368).
It is said the artist wove some of her own hair into the subject's
flying mane.</TE>
<TE>   Another treasure Li points out is a set of porcelain folios meant
to encourage and describe cotton cultivation and weaving in text and
line illustrations. It was made during the reign of Emperor Qianlong,
who ruled from 1736 to 1793 and was considered the most cultivated of
the Qing rulers, a poet, a calligrapher and a voracious collector of
Chinese art and antiques.</TE>
<TE>   Li slowly navigates the folios, linked so that they collapse into
neat accordion folds. Text on the left, illustrations on the right,
the folios follow the cultivation of cotton from farmers' planting
seeds to the appearance of the first sprouts and cotton balls popping
open. There are folios that show cleaning, spinning, weaving and
finally, commercial trade. The last panel in the second volume shows
a fabric shop on the right and merchants doing business in a teahouse
on the left.</TE>
<TE>   The Bowers Museum is so convinced of the draw of the Chinese
objects that it plans to keep "Symbols of Power" on display for 11
months.</TE>
<TE>   Keller notes his appreciation for the generosity of the Nanjing
Museum: "We've been frankly shocked at their willingness to let us
borrow their historic pieces."</TE>
<TE>   As Li points out, however, his museum can only display a fraction
of its holdings at any one time. The same is true in other parts of
China, which is partly why the Bowers has more imported exhibitions
planned.</TE>
<TE>   After the Nanjing show ends next year, Keller and Shih have
arranged for a show from the Yunan Museum, known for its bronzes from
the Western Han Dynasty. That will be followed by a separate show of
objects from the Potala Palace, the Dalai Lama's ancestral home.</TE>
<TE>   And in 2004, the Bowers is planning an exhibition from the
Shanghai Museum, which, like the Nanjing Museum and the National
Palace Museum, has a wide-ranging collection of Chinese art and
artifacts.</TE>

<HD>Piano Spoken Here: Bud Powell and His Descendants</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bud Powell was one of the two piano giants of the bebop era. (The
other was Thelonious Monk.) But there's more than bop to Powell's
story because, vital as he was to the revolutionary jazz sounds of
the '40s, his influence ultimately reached well beyond the music's
relatively hermetic world.</LD>
<LD>   Aspects of Powell's loping melodic lines, roving freely across
harmonic borders, can be heard--in one form or another--in pianists
ranging from Horace Silver, Oscar Peterson and Bill Evans to Keith
Jarrett, McCoy Tyner and Chick Corea. And most of those stunningly
innovative qualities are present in a splendid, newly released
recording.</LD>
<LD>   Bud Powell, "Live in Lausanne, 1962" (***1/2, Stretch Records
Archives). This collection, never before available, was reportedly
brought to the attention of Corea (who is the founder of Stretch
Records) by Powell's daughter Celia. Chronicling a radio broadcast in
June 1962, it was a time when the pianist, intermittently suffering
from mental breakdowns, was living in Paris and generally functioning
at a high productive level. That was a particularly fruitful year for
Powell, yielding a fine recording with French bassist Pierre Michelot
and Kenny Clarke, as well as a booking at Stockholm's Golden Circle
Club that produced material for an impressive five-CD set eventually
released in the mid-'90s.</LD>
<TE>   In the Lausanne set, recorded a few months after the Golden Circle
gig, Powell is accompanied by a little-known pair of European
players, bassist Bob Jacquillard and drummer Mike Stevenot. Unfazed
by their relatively modest skills, he simply picks up the music and
punches everything into high gear. Perhaps because of his unfamiliar
companions, however, Powell plays a program almost completely devoted
to bop standards--"Anthropology," "Billie's Bounce," "Woody 'n' You"
and "Ornithology" among them--rather than his first-rate originals.</TE>
<TE>   The results are nonetheless superlative--less so in terms of the
sort of sheer invention of Powell's earlier years than in his
capacity to generate a relentless sense of swing. Usually praised for
his harmonic vision and bebop chops, Powell was too infrequently
acknowledged for the masterful propulsion and upbeat rhythmic lift
that brought his music to life. Here's a good opportunity--despite
the less than optimal recorded sound--to check out both those
qualities.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Weston, "Ancient Future/Blue" (***, Mutable Music). Weston,
76, started out from the inside of piano bebop, so to speak. Wynton
Kelly was a cousin, and Monk was one of his earliest mentors. That
association was highly visible in Weston's early work, enhanced by a
gift for melodic hooks that resulted in a pair of well-known jazz
standards, "Little Niles" and "Hi-Fly."</TE>
<TE>   Weston's musical vision was transformed when he visited Nigeria in
the early '60s and lived in Morocco from that time into the early
'70s. That immersion in the continent's rich cultural currents has
remained a constant factor in his musical thinking.</TE>
<TE>   This new release consists of a reissue of a 1984 LP, "Blue," and
the recent collection "Ancient Future (recorded in June 2001). Both
are richly inventive solo piano meditations, largely exploring
Weston's own material, with the addition of "Mystery of Love" on the
"Blue" CD, and "It Don't Mean a Thing," "Come Sunday," "Body and
Soul" and "Out of the Past" on the "Ancient Future" disc.</TE>
<TE>   Traces of his association with Monk surface on "Ballad for T"
(presumably for "Thelonious"), and on many of the tracks Weston
manages to invest his piano work with echoes of African percussion
and the plangent sounds of the kora and mbira.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Williams, "This Side Up," (***, MAXJAZZ). Williams' bebop
roots reach through the playing of Bill Evans, as they do for so many
other pianists in her age group (she is 54). But the real key to her
playing lies in the logo on the inside of her album's cover:
"Improvisation Transforms Feeling Into Music."</TE>
<TE>   Working with bassist Ray Drummond and drummer Victor Lewis--two of
jazz's finest accompanists--Williams offers a program devoted almost
exclusively to originals.</TE>
<TE>   Three pieces celebrate individuals she considers primary mentors.
"Miles to Go" recalls the grooving Miles Davis lines of the mid-'50s;
interestingly, in her solo, Williams somehow manages--it's not quite
clear how--to slide the pitches on some of the notes within her piano
melodies in blues-accented fashion.</TE>
<TE>   "The Judge," a tribute to bass great Milt Hinton, recalls the
blend of lyricism and swing that was always present in his playing.
And "I Remember Dexter"--honoring Dexter Gordon--captures the tenor
saxophonist's gutsy drive via a blues that switch suddenly back and
forth between 6/4 and 4/4 time.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' playing throughout is filled with the crisply
articulated accents and catchy melodic phrasing that have long been
characteristic of her appealing improvisational style. Sadly, after
decades of fine playing, she still hasn't received the recognition
her talent deserves.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Charlap, "Stardust" (***, Blue Note). Charlap may only be in
his mid-30s, but he has the mature musical touch of someone who has
been playing the book of standards for decades. Unlike many of his
keyboard contemporaries, however, his connection to bebop traces not
through Bill Evans, but via such elegantly styled individualists as
Hank Jones, Tommy Flanagan and Kenny Barron.</TE>
<TE>   Following current thinking among jazz producers, the album has a
thematic underpinning--a look at Hoagy Carmichael's music. Not a bad
idea, given the composer's long association with jazz, as well as the
affection accorded many of his songs by jazz artists.</TE>
<TE>   The selection included here is first-rate, among others, "The
Nearness of You," "Georgia on My Mind" and "Skylark"-- all of which
display Charlap's unerring sense of tone and phrasing, and his
capacity to add subtle harmonic connections without interrupting a
song's emotional flow.</TE>
<TE>   The album also reflects current production ideas in a not always
successful fashion: the inclusion of guest stars, especially
vocalists. When the guest stars are saxophonist Frank Wess and
guitarist Jim Hall, the idea works very well--especially in a
delightful rendering of "Two Sleepy People" with the ever-wonderful
Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The vocal offerings are more uneven. Shirley Horn, backed by
Charlap's evocative piano, finds precisely the right touch for the
title track, especially during her exquisite rendering of its
marvelous verse. But the usually dependable Tony Bennett, whose
presence will probably have a lot to do with the album's sales,
sounds foggy, out of sorts (and, occasionally, out of tune) on one of
the most dramatic songs in the Carmichael lexicon, "I Get Along
Without You Very Well." It's the only misstep in an otherwise
attractive showcase for a gifted pianist.</TE>

<HD>A Skewed Energy Policy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The president agrees to buy up oil leases offshore from brother Jeb's
Florida but shows no sign of doing the same thing with leases off the
California coast that date back to the 1960s. The oil lease buyback
was quite a show of brotherly love in this election year--but it's
only a sideshow in a schizophrenic federal energy policy. If only
Washington would listen to California.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, seeking to counter Vice President Dick Cheney's
denigration of conservation as a way to save energy, President Bush
made a show of adding conservation rhetoric to his energy plan. But
it turns out to be mostly rhetoric. In late May, the administration
scaled back the new energy-efficiency standards for air conditioners
set late in the Clinton administration. The administration already
had rejected any increase in auto mileage standards, the best way to
stretch U.S. petroleum supplies.</LD>
<TE>   Bush says he seeks balance between energy and the environment. But
there's little balance in the Interior Department's plan to allow the
drilling of 51,000 coal-bed methane gas wells in northeastern
Wyoming. The wells will bring to the surface an estimated 4.4 million
acre-feet of water that is so salty it cannot be used for farming,
ranching or in the home. That's enough water--if it were any good--to
supply Los Angeles for seven years. The Environmental Protection
Agency called the resulting water pollution and runoff unacceptable.
Interior officials said, in effect, hey, let's talk it over and find
a way around this little water problem.</TE>
<TE>   There was little balance to the zeal with which the administration
sought to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Fortunately,
the U.S. Senate said no.</TE>
<TE>   The nation could benefit from a lot more weight on the
conservation side of the equation. Look at what the state of
California did to combat the 2000-01 electric power crisis. Bush
aides claimed California brought the crisis on itself by not building
enough power plants. There was some truth to this, but the other side
of the story was how much the state was able to save through
conservation achieved without discomfort or hardship.</TE>
<TE>   The state Energy Commission says that by June 2001, users had cut
demand by 5,570 megawatts, about one-seventh the total power use on a
warm summer day in California. The savings was the equivalent of
building five giant power plants costing about $2.5 billion. More
remarkable, this was in addition to more than 8,000 megawatts
conserved over previous years.</TE>
<TE>   Conservation programs proved relatively inexpensive in terms of
the amount of electricity they saved. Much of the effort cost nothing
at all--just switching off lights and running the washing machine
after 7 p.m. Considerable conservation just keeps on working at no
additional cost, like the Energizer bunny.</TE>
<TE>   But we can't have more efficient air conditioners because the
manufacturers say it will cost too much? How do we balance
that--drill more gas wells in Wyoming?</TE>

<HD>Enlisting in Reality</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two big enlistments occurred recently, both very American and maybe
even revealing about the cultural cacophony that survives in this
country, war or no war.</LD>
<LD>   Rocker Ozzy Osbourne's bizarre family grandly enlisted for 20 more
MTV episodes of the alleged reality within its Beverly Hills mansion.
And Pat Tillman, a 25-year-old hard-hitting, independent-minded
safety for the Arizona Cardinals, quietly enlisted in the reality of
becoming an Army Ranger. One party takes millions of viewers (and a
few million dollars) into its private world, while the other forsakes
millions of dollars for the privacy of not being viewed by millions
of spectators.</LD>
<LD>   This year the unscripted profane family "comedy" drew the largest
number of viewers ever to MTV, which isn't saying a whole lot. But it
sure boosts the cable ad rates to have more people willing to
eavesdrop on the tattooed Ozzy arguing with his (bleep) wife and
shouting at his (bleep) kids. And the exposure probably won't hurt
other Ozzy products, including a traveling rock fest for the singer,
who, so the story goes, once bit off the head of a bat on stage.</LD>
<TE>   Tillman could earn more than a million a year for knocking down
other large men on six months of Sundays for millions of football
fans. Now, he'll have to wear a beret and will gross a little over a
grand a month to get shot at. Hello, Tillman, who's your accountant?</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't know how to play the publicity game either. To ensure
privacy, Tillman asked his employers for a day's head start before
releasing word of his decision. He's always been
different--graduating magna cum laude, shunning the loud clothes,
cars and lifestyle of some pro athletes. Now, he and his brother
Kevin have opted for three years of national service where TV cameras
don't usually go.</TE>
<TE>   Cameras seem to follow "The Osbournes" everywhere, which seemed to
grab the attention of a cult following Tuesday nights. This success
prompted E! Entertainment to sign up Anna Nicole Smith as a "reality
TV" subject. Better known for posing and suing, the ex-Playboy model
and current oil heiress says she's excited about being followed all
over by cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, MTV promises three Osbourne specials this summer,
including "a very special dinner" with the family. But probably no
reality coverage of the camouflaged Tillmans downing field rations
somewhere.</TE>

<HD>Scandal May Open New Doors in Energy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid daily revelations of possible dishonesty and apparent
foolishness in energy trading, what is really going on is a great
shakeout that will lead to bargain electricity prices for the next
few years.</LD>
<LD>   In the boom that ended last year, many firms in the nationwide
electricity industry--including Enron Corp.--fostered the illusion
that they could increase sales and profits 20% to 30% a year, even
though electricity usage advanced only by 2% to 3% a year.</LD>
<LD>   Now Enron is in Chapter 11, and other companies are dropping out
of energy trading or trying to sell assets and shares to pay their
debts.</LD>
<TE>   Opportunity may be the next phase as newcomers enter the business.
Oil and gas companies may step into electricity because they have the
deep pockets needed for owning generating plants and marketing their
output. ChevronTexaco Corp. is backing Dynegy Inc.; BP is rumored to
be looking at a relationship with Calpine Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street firms may see opportunity in trading electricity once
current outcries and investigations of shady practices pass. UBS
Warburg purchased Enron's trading business. The New York Mercantile
Exchange's energy-trading operation, which includes credit guarantees
and federal regulation, is gaining participants.</TE>
<TE>   Ailing companies such as PG&amp;E Corp., whose utility unit is under
bankruptcy protection, and Edison International probably will make a
comeback in the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   But in the present turmoil, such a peaceful, rational future is
not easy to foresee. Instead, credit-rating firms are forcing
Calpine, Williams Cos., Dynegy and others to sell assets in a soft
market and sell stock when their share prices are in the basement.</TE>
<TE>   Other companies with stronger finances--Constellation Energy Group
Inc., American Electric Power Co., Sempra Energy, Exelon Corp. and
others--are carrying on trading as part of their main electricity
business in an evolving time for the industry.</TE>
<TE>   This is an ideal time for electricity buyers to make long-term
contracts--and for the state of California to renegotiate the
expensive deals it signed under duress more than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   But investors and everyone with a stake in the future of the
$300-billion electricity industry should understand how this
situation came to be. Electric utilities, which have traded power
with neighboring utilities for decades, were enabled by the federal
Energy Supply Act of 1992 to move power to industrial users
nationwide, using improved transmission grids.</TE>
<TE>   Electricity-trading markets grew up to facilitate such power sales
and energy moved around the country more efficiently. But it should
be noted that the new system did not increase demand for power or add
to total supply. Even so, Enron and other companies made energy
trading sound like a growth industry.</TE>
<TE>   Many firms seemed to get very large--Enron grew to more than $40
billion in sales, for example. But that was only because they took
the ostensible value of everything they traded into their annual
accounts--a contract for millions of dollars over 10 years would be
recorded as a single year's sales.</TE>
<TE>   Some firms engaged in exchanges of the same amount of energy at
the same price--so-called wash sales--just to swell their trading
volumes and make them look like players.</TE>
<TE>   Credit was abundant from lenders and bond markets that accorded
risk-bearing, unregulated companies the credit status of traditional
regulated utilities.</TE>
<TE>   But illusions ended with Enron's collapse last fall and demand in
recent weeks from credit-rating firms that energy traders bolster
their balance sheets. El Paso Corp. and Reliant Resources Inc. are
retreating from the trading business because it demands too much
capital.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's Investors Service, a credit-rating firm, issued a white
paper last week saying, in effect, that energy trading may not be
investment creditworthy unless it is attached to a "more stable core
business."</TE>
<TE>   However, the original reason for energy trading--to facilitate
power sales and efficient supply--remain.</TE>
<TE>   "We customize energy supply for industrial customers, delivering
electricity or natural gas to chemical plants or fertilizer makers on
a schedule and with pricing flexibility that suits their production
plans," explains David Messer, president of Sempra Energy Trading,
the Stamford, Conn.-based wholesale trading division of Sempra, the
San Diego-based holding company for San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and
Southern California Gas.</TE>
<TE>   Sempra has a solid A2 investment-grade credit rating to support
its wholesale business, which is in Europe, Latin America and Asia as
well as the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Other companies with well-backed energy trading include
Constellation Energy Group Inc., a company combining the Baltimore
Gas &amp; Electric utility with a merchant energy marketer and trader
that was created by investment firm Goldman Sachs.</TE>
<TE>   American Electric Power, a Columbus, Ohio-based utility, sells
electricity wholesale in the Southwest and elsewhere. AEP is
separating its regulated and unregulated business because tensions
arise between employees and managers in the two types of operations.</TE>
<TE>   The unregulated business emphasizes marketing and profit, with
incentive pay for higher sales; the traditional regulated utility
stresses reliability of power supply and puts a premium on employees
who think first of customer service.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the Enron debacle, investors probably will
favor traditional utility companies, which pay dividends rather than
chase after promises of growth, says analyst Brian Youngberg of
Edward Jones &amp; Co. He cites the example of Southern Co., an
Atlanta-based utility that got out of trading by spinning off its
Mirant Corp. division to shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Companies such as Williams, which has pipelines, refineries and
oil and gas production as well as energy trading, and Aquila Inc., a
Kansas City, Mo.-based utility firm, are trying to improve their
balance sheets so they can remain in trading.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose-based Calpine is negotiating alliances with large
companies, says analyst Michael Worms of the Gerard Klauer Mattison
investment firm. BP issued a statement last week saying that it is
not preparing to acquire Calpine, after market rumors in London and
New York suggested it was.</TE>
<TE>   "The energy industry is evolving," says Edward Muller, an investor
in energy ventures and former president of Irvine-based Edison
Mission Energy. "Ultimately, electricity will become like oil and gas
and other commodity businesses, with specialized firms and big major
players. Trading, with some rules imposed, will be an ordinary part
of the business."</TE>
<TE>   With numerous power plants built in recent years, the availability
of electricity looks ample for this summer and next, although
transmission lines will continue to need reinforcement and expansion,
says analyst Steven Fleishman of Merrill Lynch.</TE>
<TE>   That promises stability in the electricity markets in California
and other Western states, a good time to work out intelligent energy
policies.</TE>

Spears and Eminem would have no music careers.</TE>
<TE>   Record companies invest millions in producing and promoting the
artists in their rosters, and if they don't get their songs played on
radio, none of us would go out and buy their records.</TE>
<TE>   If it's to their advantage to slip the radio station, either
directly or through an "independent" promoter, a little something as
an incentive, why shouldn't they do it? Why should Congress even care
about this?</TE>
<TE>   Commercial radio hasn't been a viable method for an unsigned
artist to get exposure since the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Those who don't have that level of clout rely on public/college
radio or small independent stations (whose signals can barely cross
the street).</TE>
<TE>   A growing number is even starting to find the Internet a great
medium for broadcast as well.</TE>
<TE>   If Congress wants to help, it should spend more money on public
radio stations and make the airwaves more in the public interest and
less in the interests of the record companies.</TE>

<KH>EXECUTIVE PAY REPORT: Working to Retire Overcompensation</KH>
<HD>Shareholders join others in calling for reductions in CEO
packages</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shareholders and corporate activists have been complaining for years
about runaway executive pay. But in 2002--the year of Enron, E-Trade
and Ebbers--the voices for change finally are finding an audience.</LD>
<LD>   Across corporate America this spring, company managers have been
fighting shareholder resolutions seeking to put limits on how much
the top bosses can be paid.</LD>
<LD>   Financial leaders such as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
are calling for accounting changes to staunch the flood of stock
option giveaways to executives. And big institutional investors
increasingly are asking tough questions when a company's stock price
fails to keep up with its chief executive's paycheck.</LD>
<TE>   Why the sudden outburst? Call it the "Enron effect."</TE>
<TE>   The collapse late last year of energy trader Enron Corp. and the
subsequent allegations of self-dealing, questionable accounting and
self-enrichment--including the roughly $150 million that CEO Kenneth
L. Lay raked in during 2000--provided a catalyst for critics of the
state of corporate governance and its effect on the way America's top
executives are compensated.</TE>
<TE>   "Something fundamentally changed with Enron," said Scott Klinger,
co-director of responsible wealth at Boston-based United for a Fair
Economy, a group dedicated to narrowing the gap between the upper and
lower classes.</TE>
<TE>   "People are becoming skeptical about what's behind the numbers."</TE>
<TE>   But Enron wasn't the only case that drew fire from compensation
critics. News this spring that regulators are looking into millions
of dollars in personal loans that Bernard J. Ebbers received while
CEO of WorldCom Inc. drew a sharp response from investors, who have
watched WorldCom's stock plunge 90% over the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Menlo Park, Calif.-based E-Trade Group Inc. also created a furor a
month ago when it revealed CEO Christos Cotsakos' $71million pay
package for 2001--a year in which the online brokerage lost
$24million. The criticism was so intense that Cotsakos agreed to
return part of the pay package.</TE>
<TE>   More broadly, critics such as Klinger contend that in the United
States, CEO compensation outstrips the paycheck of the average worker
by a much greater degree than in other industrialized nations such as
Japan and Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the clamor over compensation comes amid a rare slump
in executive pay.</TE>
<TE>   In a study of 350 large U.S. companies, Mercer Human Resource
Consulting found that the average chief executive's pay package fell
almost 1% last year. The average salary increased 4.7%, but bonuses
fell 13.5% and the plummeting stock market drastically reduced the
value of many executives' stock option packages.</TE>
<TE>   That provided ammunition for those who contend that executive pay
reflects corporate performance, and that companies that hope to keep
top-notch executive talent must pay the market rate.</TE>
<TE>   "We are hitting an interesting tension," said Blair Jones, senior
vice president at Sibson Consulting, an executive- pay advice arm of
benefit-consulting firm Segal Co. "We have talked about
pay-for-performance being really important, and it is. But you have
to balance that against the driver of attracting top talent. That
makes it tough for companies to toe the true pay-for-performance
line."</TE>
<TE>   Responded Klinger: "The people who have the skills to run a
company deserve to be compensated. But there are limits."</TE>
<TE>   But what are they? Trillium Asset Management Corp., a money
management firm whose investments are determined in part by a set of
social principles, has developed a straightforward yardstick for the
companies whose shares it owns: The firm votes against any CEO
compensation plan that exceeds a combined $5 million a year in cash
and stock.</TE>
<TE>   "These numbers are arbitrary," acknowledged Simon Billenness,
senior analyst with Trillium in Boston. "But you have to ask
yourself, how much more do you need?"</TE>
<TE>   There's no right answer, of course.</TE>
<TE>   "If you get the right leadership, it can be worth a lot of money,"
said Jones of Sibson Consulting. "I think where we have gone wrong is
in thinking that everybody is worth that."</TE>
<TE>   Changing that thinking won't be easy, as even critics of executive
pay trends acknowledge.</TE>
<TE>   "Because the problem is very gross doesn't mean it has an easy
solution," said Charles T. Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire
Hathaway Corp. and CEO of Pasadena-based Wesco Financial Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "Every sign I see indicates that the situation is getting worse,
and I think it's going to be very difficult to fix."</TE>
<TE>   Shareholder activism has been the weapon of choice recently.
Corporate annual meetings have produced a wave of shareholder
resolutions, including initiatives at EMC Corp, Jones Apparel Group
Inc. and Bank of America Corp., seeking to rein in executive pay.</TE>
<TE>   Resolutions to force changes in corporate governance--almost
always opposed by management--usually are easily defeated. But a
proxy advisory service that tracks shareholder resolutions said last
week that 39% have received a majority of shareholder votes this
year--well ahead of the previous record of 25%.</TE>
<TE>   "This year is shaping up to be quite extraordinary," Ann Yerger,
research director of the Council of Institutional Investors, said of
the findings by the Investor Responsibility Research Center.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts noted that shareholders typically become restive
when the stock market is slumping, as it has been for the last two
years. But others stress the role played by shareholders
disillusioned by corporate scandals and massive executive pay
packages.</TE>
<TE>   "The lesson of this is that shareholders have to be active and
involved in electing directors, who are supposed to be their
representatives at the company," said Bill Patterson, director of the
AFL/CIO office of investment.</TE>
<TE>   "Runaway executive pay is a symptom of how boards are captives of
CEOs. The price of having a captive board is enormous when you are
investing in a company like Enron or [telecom firm] Global Crossing,"
which now are in bankruptcy proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the noise about executive pay and corporate governance in
general is coming from big institutional investors--the mutual fund
companies, pension funds and other big money managers that can own
big chunks of a company's stock and thereby wield a lot of clout at
voting time.</TE>
<TE>   Mutual fund and pension giant TIAA-CREF has long been active in
corporate governance issues. But it was joined this spring by a
potentially formidable group of investment managers that includes
Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard Group, the nation's second-largest
mutual fund company, and Bill Miller, the well-known fund manager for
Legg Mason Inc.</TE>
<TE>   But even among institutional investors, there is a lack of
consensus on how to proceed. Many fund managers said their duty when
confronted with profligate corporate management is to sell the
stock--not to try to change the company.</TE>
<TE>   Another forum for change could be Congress.</TE>
<TE>   One bill introduced last year would cap executive paychecks at 25
times the wage of the company's lowest-paid worker. That would mean
that if a company employed workers who were paid the national minimum
wage of $5.15 an hour, it couldn't pay the CEO more than about
$250,000 a year without running afoul of the law.</TE>
<TE>   Though that cap may be too draconian, imposing one would both
limit executive pay and put a spotlight on a living wage for
everyone, Klinger said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what the right ratio is, whether it should be 25
times or 100 times," he said. "But I'd guess it would be somewhere in
between."</TE>
<TE>   Given the lackluster record of Enron-related reform legislation,
it's unlikely such a cap would ever become law.</TE>
<TE>   A more effective strategy may be the push to change accounting
standards to reveal the cost of issuing stock options.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan backs this approach, as do pay critics such as Munger.
But it has generated intense opposition among
corporations--especially tech companies, some of which could see
their reported profits turn into huge losses.</TE>
<TE>   Companies aren't required to list the cost of stock options as an
expense on their income statement. That allows boards to grant
millions of options to managers each year without fully disclosing
the effect on both the company's bottom line and on shareholders,
whose ownership interest becomes increasingly diluted as more shares
are issued to satisfy the option grants.</TE>
<TE>   How bad can it get? TIAA-CREF just successfully fought a company's
incentive stock option plan that would have diluted public
shareholders' ownership stake by 40%, said Peter Clapman, TIAA-CREF's
senior vice president and chief counsel.</TE>
<TE>   "If that's happening year after year, your stock position is
constantly being eroded," Clapman said. "Meanwhile, the CEO would get
an extraordinary amount of money if the stock price went up [just] 5%
per year. These are great payoffs without any performance."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, though, the case for pay reform involves more than
fair play for shareholders or fairness for rank-and file-workers,
compensation critics contend.</TE>
<TE>   "If the existing system keeps going on and on in its present
direction, large American businesses are going to be widely hated and
distrusted by the citizens of America," Munger said.</TE>
<TE>   "That is not a good outcome."</TE>

<HD>Lower-Income Savers Catch a Break With Retirement Credit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: My local newspaper had a brief mention of a new IRS tax
break that pays for half of an IRA contribution. The article did not
say whether this credit applied only to traditional IRAs or to Roth
IRAs as well. Apparently, this is a new item effective for the 2002
tax year.</LD>
<LD>   This seems too good to be true. Most of the other additions to the
tax code have been, in my opinion, a form of welfare, such as giving
wage earners who owe no taxes sizable refunds for the earned income
credit and the child tax credit. I'm wondering whether this is more
of the same.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Well, that's a little harsh. Tax breaks aimed at
lower-income working families are designed to help people out of
poverty and reward them for working, rather than being on welfare.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, these tax breaks can be mind-numbingly complicated.
Even tax professionals have trouble explaining how the earned income
credit works, for example.</TE>
<TE>   Your question, however, was about the new retirement contribution
credit. This credit is available when adjusted gross income is less
than $25,000 for single people, $37,500 for heads of household or
$50,000 for married couples. (If you're not sure what your adjusted
gross income is, take out your latest tax return. It's on line 4 of
the 1040EZ, line 19 of the 1040A and line 33 of the regular 1040.)</TE>
<TE>   Those who make contributions to retirement plans, such as 401(k)s,
403(b)s, IRAs and Roth IRAs, are allowed to take a credit that varies
from 10% to 50% of their contribution. The maximum contribution
considered for the credit is $2,000, so taxpayers can get $200 to
$1,000 knocked off their tax bill depending on their income.</TE>
<TE>   This break comes on top of any deduction you already get from
making these contributions. In other words, you can get the credit in
addition to being able to deduct contributions to workplace
retirement plans and traditional IRAs. Roth IRA contributions aren't
deductible, but you can claim the credit if you qualify.</TE>
<TE>   This credit is available only to taxpayers 18 and older and is
scheduled to be in effect for five years--from 2002 to 2006. Unlike
the earned income credit, however, this credit is nonrefundable. That
means that you can only use it to offset the taxes you owe, not to
boost your refund if you don't owe any tax.</TE>
<TE>   Another hitch is that contributing to deductible retirement plans
could interfere with some lower-income families' ability to get the
earned income credit.</TE>
<TE>   The reasons are as complex as the tax code, but if you qualify for
the earned income credit, you'll probably want to consult with a tax
pro before contributing to a tax-deductible retirement plan.</TE>
<TE>   Social Security Number</TE>
<TE>   Not an All-Purpose ID</TE>
<TE>   Q: In a recent column, you said people should try to avoid giving
out their Social Security numbers except when required for tax or
credit purposes. For seniors on Medicare, however, Social Security
numbers are printed in bold on their Medicare cards and are
photocopied every time we visit a new doctor. Unfortunately, that
cannot be avoided unless the government is encouraged to change the
ID numbers on the cards.</TE>
<TE>   A: Most people with health insurance have the same problem. We're
all told not to keep our Social Security cards in our wallets as a
way to discourage identity theft. Yet health insurers blithely print
these numbers on our ID cards, and most of us like to keep those
cards with us in case of emergency.</TE>
<TE>   It may be an uphill battle to change the government's system, but
other agencies have been forced to adapt to modern realities. Some
states that printed Social Security numbers on drivers' licenses have
stopped because of identity theft concerns, as have many colleges and
universities that once used the numbers on student ID cards.</TE>
<TE>   California passed a law, which goes into effect July 1, that
restricts how Social Security numbers can be used. The law eventually
will force insurers to use a different number on consumers' ID cards,
and stop businesses from requiring a Social Security number to access
their services, unless a password is used.</TE>
<TE>   These changes happened because of public pressure. So if you don't
like what Medicare is doing, send them a letter to politely express
your concerns, and contact your congressional representatives as
well.</TE>
<TE>   It's also a good idea to check your credit report once a year to
make sure you haven't become a victim of identity theft. Look for
unauthorized accounts or inquiries that could indicate you've been
scammed.</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayer, CPA Team Up on Preparing Return</TE>
<TE>   Q: I thought you might be interested in a "middle ground" solution
to the issue of whether to do your own taxes or use a professional.</TE>
<TE>   For years I had an accountant complete my return, but the price
increased each year. Meanwhile, the quality of the tax software kept
improving. I talked with my CPA and we came to an agreement: I
prepare my return with Turbo Tax, then fax or mail him the completed
return. He checks the work for errors and missing items and makes
fixes. His fee is about one-third the cost of doing the complete
return. We both come out on the winning side.</TE>
<TE>   A: Yours is an excellent suggestion--if the tax preparer is
willing. Some tax pros prefer not to cut their fees, and others find
they spend so much time correcting the do-it-yourselfer's errors that
they would rather not do the return if they can't prepare it from
scratch.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if your return is relatively simple and you feel confident
in your ability to do most of the work yourself, approach your tax
preparer to see whether he or she is willing to meet you halfway.</TE>

<KH>EXECUTIVE PAY REPORT</KH>
<HD>Directors Determine CEO's Worth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wonder how KB Home Chief Executive Bruce Karatz got to be one of
Southern California's highest-paid executives last year? It's no
secret.</LD>
<LD>   The alchemy behind Karatz's pay--as well as the pay of the
most-highly compensated officers at any public company--is spelled
out in company proxy statements, which are filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission and sent to shareholders each year.</LD>
<LD>   KB Home aims to pay its executives more than the average big real
estate firm, the proxy said. And it links executive pay to
shareholder returns with several incentive compensation plans.</LD>
<TE>   Karatz, 56, received a $895,833 salary, plus a performance bonus
of $6.6 million in 2001. That big bonus was part of an incentive plan
that promises to pay Karatz 1.25% of the pretax profit of the
L.A.-based home builder, provided the company hits certain earnings
goals. Karatz also is entitled to a stock bonus equal to one-half of
1% of the company's pretax profit exceeding $50 million, according to
his employment agreement, which is included in the company's proxy
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Because he signed a new seven-year employment agreement, Karatz
also received 350,000 shares of restricted stock as a retention
bonus. Restricted shares are a gift with strings attached--executives
can keep the shares only if they meet certain conditions.</TE>
<TE>   In Karatz's case, he must stay at KB Home through 2008. The market
value of those restricted shares: $12.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Karatz exercised $23.4 million in incentive stock
options during the year, and he also received $1.3 million in
long-term incentive pay. Total direct compensation: $44.4
million--roughly one-fifth of KB Home's 2001 net income of $214
million. That secured Karatz the top spot in a survey by Mercer Human
Resource Consulting of CEO pay at 100 of the largest Southland public
companies in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "There were some special circumstances this year that affected
Karatz's pay," said Debra Hotaling, director of public relations at
KB Home.</TE>
<TE>   Take out the one-time signing bonus and the $23 million in stock
options and the package "becomes more in keeping with how
compensation really works here."</TE>
<TE>   While Karatz's cash pay soared 46%, the company reported that the
average KB Home employee received a 4.3% merit increase in 2001,
according to the proxy.</TE>
<TE>   The decision on how much to pay Karatz--and most other top
executives at U.S. public companies--is made by the board of
directors.</TE>
<TE>   This year, with outsize executive pay packages coming under
mounting criticism from shareholders, directors and their pay-setting
rationales are drawing increasing scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "Pay is the symptom, not the disease. The focus is on the board of
directors," said Nell Minow, editor of the Web site Corporate
Library, which tracks executive pay. "They are writing a check on
somebody else's bank account."</TE>
<TE>   Corporate governance reformers say a significant percentage of a
company's board should be made up of independent directors--people
who don't work for the company, consult for the company or have some
other economic tie to management. Within the board, there should a
compensation committee, which looks at pay policies and determines
what the company's top execs will earn. Ideally, every member of the
compensation committee should be an independent director and
experienced in executive-pay matters.</TE>
<TE>   KB Home has 11 directors, only two of whom work for the company.
The compensation committee is made up of four directors, none of whom
works for KB Home.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate directors may determine their executives' pay by looking
at pay packages offered to executives at similar companies, and
couple that knowledge with incentive plans designed to reward the
executive for hitting particular performance targets.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, companies say they want to pay top executives more than
the average company as a means of attracting top-level talent.</TE>
<TE>   But when everyone's trying to pay more than average, the average
tends to move up at a rapid clip.</TE>
<TE>   Certain types of compensation--such as stock options--are not easy
to value and don't need to be accounted for on company income
statements. That can cause boards to give stock options willy-nilly
without considering the long-term effect on shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   And that's in the best cases. In the worst cases, directors are so
close to the executives they are supposed to oversee that they simply
rubber stamp the CEO's suggestions for his own pay, leading to top
managers earning more than the companies they operate.</TE>
<TE>   Unrealistic executive paychecks are a symptom of a board that's
not doing its job of representing shareholder interests, Minow said.
If the board is not vigilant, shareholders must rise up and oust the
directors, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Shareholders are a key component in holding companies
accountable," said Simon Billenness, senior analyst with Trillium
Asset Management in Boston. "Since this money is coming out of the
pockets of shareholders, I think it's important that they support a
movement for greater sanity in executive pay."</TE>

<HD>Wall Street Grapples With a New Set of Fears</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stock market is supposed to be a "discounting mechanism"--that
is, it's supposed to be a place where well-informed, rational people
weigh future prospects against current events and value stocks
accordingly.</LD>
<LD>   Theoretically, then, the sum of all fears at any given moment
should be reflected in share prices.</LD>
<LD>   But that assumes that investors know what they're supposed to be
afraid of and can fairly judge the likelihood of the worst-case
scenario (say, for the economy), the best-case scenario and the
points in between.</LD>
<TE>   As key stock indexes have stumbled this year after the fourth
quarter's surge, analysts frequently have cited the generic fear
factor. Investors are "uncomfortable, uneasy, nervous," a market
strategist said in describing one day's action last week. That's
classic Wall Street--explain everything by explaining nothing in
particular.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there is more to that quote than meets the eye. A core reason
for the market's struggle this year is that many investors are trying
to weigh, and to appropriately discount, very different fears from
what they faced in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The things that frightened the stock market in the last decade
amounted to the usual suspects, in some cases left over from the
1970s and 1980s. Would inflation revive? Would the Federal Reserve
raise interest rates? Would Japan's economy collapse and take the
rest of the world with it? Would U.S. consumer debt levels become so
burdensome that spending would fizzle?</TE>
<TE>   The events of Sept. 11, of course, have made the 1990s' worries
seem almost pedestrian. When the stock market reopened after the
attacks, prices plummeted, reflecting the sum of all new fears at
that moment. But within one week the market was rebounding, which
proved to be a correct bet that the war in Afghanistan would largely
succeed and that the U.S. economy wouldn't plunge into depression.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorist Acts Are</TE>
<TE>   New-Style Uncertainty</TE>
<TE>   Even as shares recovered in the fourth quarter, it was generally
accepted that terrorists would strike on U.S. soil again. The stock
market appeared to be intelligently discounting that
probability--that is, investors accepted it, but believed that new
attacks would lack the total surprise factor of Sept. 11 and that the
market therefore quickly would overcome the shock of any new strikes.</TE>
<TE>   That still may turn out to be true. Yet in the absence of new
attacks since Sept. 11, many people (including those with money to
invest) may feel as much apprehensiveness as relief. Nobody wishes
for another strike, but the terrorists' inaction makes for greater
uncertainty: We're still guessing what they're capable of doing, and
when.</TE>
<TE>   One of Wall Street's favorite say-nothing explanations is that
"the market hates uncertainty." It's a silly line because, after all,
there is always plenty of uncertainty. But it's meant to be a
relative term--that certain kinds of uncertainty are worse than
others when investors are trying to discount the future and judge
risk versus potential return.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the Fed is going to raise interest rates two times or
three times by year's end is old-style uncertainty for the stock
market. Whether terrorists might be capable of electronically
invading and sabotaging the U.S. banking system is new-style
uncertainty that presents a far bigger challenge for the market as a
discounting mechanism.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two weeks, a new fear element has been introduced into
the discounting equation: the threat of nuclear war between India and
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   How is Wall Street supposed to discount that possibility? It
doesn't appear to know, but the idea clearly can't be of any comfort
to a stock market that has plenty of other worries.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, share prices rallied early on surprisingly bullish
economic news, including a surge in manufactured-goods orders in
April and a report basically affirming previous data showing that
worker productivity rocketed in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average was up as much as 130 points by
midday. But an afternoon sell-off took back nearly all of that gain.
Many traders blamed the reversal on concerns that an India-Pakistan
conflict might erupt this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   At the close the Dow was up 13.56 points at 9,925.25. For the week
the index was down 1.8%, putting it back in the red (by 1%) year to
date. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.8% last week to end at
1,615.73. Nasdaq has fallen in 10 of the last 12 weeks, and is down
17.2% year to date.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors may argue that fear of nuclear war was a much
bigger issue for Americans, and financial markets, in the 1950s and
early 1960s--yet stocks posted dramatic gains in that period.</TE>
<TE>   But the nuclear threat during the Cold War was so massive as to be
almost surreal. A war between the United States and the Soviet Union
seemed likely to quickly escalate into mutually assured destruction.
Whether the New York Stock Exchange would be left standing was the
least of anyone's worries.</TE>
<TE>   A "limited" nuclear war is a new concept. Despite the obvious
horror at the thought of any nuclear device going off anywhere on the
planet, and the millions of lives that a limited nuclear conflict in
South Asia could take, the cold reality is that the world probably
would survive such a war.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, a single nuclear bomb attack on the United States--the
plot line of the current film "The Sum of All Fears"--wouldn't end
civilization.</TE>
<TE>   Investors Are Being</TE>
<TE>   Particularly Careful</TE>
<TE>   But it could change the way many people live their lives and their
assessment of the future. In that context, it could change people's
view of money and how they save and invest it, or perhaps whether
they should save it at all.</TE>
<TE>   For many investors, little or none of this disaster-discounting is
methodical. Much of it doesn't even occur on the conscious level.
It's too unpleasant.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, such discounting occurs in the gut: For many, it's a
general feeling that things just aren't quite right, that it's too
risky to make significant new commitments to financial assets such as
stocks. Better to wait than chance a loss, especially given the red
ink most portfolios have suffered over the last two years, investors
may figure.</TE>
<TE>   At a minimum, the new fears that have confronted investors since
Sept. 11 leave many with the sense that they must be particularly
careful not to overpay for stocks. That would explain a lot about the
market's trends this year--for example, the ongoing aversion to the
technology sector, and the continuing hunger for "value" stocks.</TE>
<TE>   But the discounting mechanism still is adjusting for this new era.
The market may not yet know how to calculate the sum of its new
fears.</TE>

<LD>Adelphia Moves to Stave Off Bankruptcy Filing</LD>
<LD>   For Adelphia Communications Corp., the chances of a bankruptcy
filing increased when Nasdaq announced plans to delist the stock this
week. Adelphia had missed several deadlines to file an annual
financial report.</LD>
<LD>   The delisting would give bondholders the right to force Adelphia
to buy back $1.4 billion in convertible debt, which could cause the
company to file for bankruptcy protection, analysts have said.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, in an attempt to stave off a bankruptcy filing,
Adelphia was in negotiations with billionaire Paul Allen to secure a
loan of as much as $2 billion, sources said. In exchange, Allen would
buy cable systems from Adelphia, including its lucrative franchises
in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   But Adelphia shareholder Leonard Tow, who joined the company's
board Tuesday, is attempting to block any quick sale.</TE>

<TE>   Memo Points to Earlier Warning for Enron</TE>
<TE>   Enron Corp. was aware of possible criminal liability for its
trading ploys in the deregulated California energy market in late
October 2000, more than a month earlier than previously disclosed,
according to a newly obtained memo.</TE>
<TE>   The document, written by outside lawyers for Enron, is far more
specific than previously released memos about the kinds of state and
federal laws Enron could have violated. Enron apparently continued to
use some of the questionable practices for several weeks after
receiving the legal advice.</TE>
<TE>   The previously undisclosed Oct. 30, 2000, memo explored concerns
that Enron's trading strategies could result in charges of wire
fraud, markets fraud and racketeering.</TE>
<TE>   Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the Oct. 30 memo, which was
turned over to federal and state investigators, was a broad
discussion of legal issues and not a commentary on specific trading
practices.</TE>
<TE>   The revelations about how Enron and possibly others conducted
themselves in the shadowy and lucrative world that was California's
power market during the depths of its energy crisis have intensified
since May 6, when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission released
memos that discussed how Enron's traders boosted profit in
California.</TE>

<TE>   Dynegy CEO Resigns</TE>
<TE>   as Probe Intensifies</TE>
<TE>   Amid increasing questions about Dynegy Inc.'s finances, Chief
Executive Chuck Watson resigned.</TE>
<TE>   No reason was cited, but analysts said it probably was related to
disclosures of sham transactions in energy trading and to the fact
that Dynegy faces downgrading of its credit rating unless it can
reduce its large debt.</TE>
<TE>   Watson, who was replaced on an interim basis by two directors, is
set to receive at least $33million more in severance payments than he
would have earned had he served out his contract.</TE>
<TE>   Houston-based Dynegy, which owns power plants in California and
other states plus natural-gas pipelines and processing facilities,
was once considered a leading player in energy trading and marketing.</TE>
<TE>   The company is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Justice Department for its reporting of a
natural-gas transaction.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ICN Board Majority</TE>
<TE>   Goes to Dissidents</TE>
<TE>   A record first quarter for ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. apparently was
not enough to preserve the influence of mercurial Chief Executive
Milan Panic as dissident shareholders gave Panic's opponents a clear
majority on the company's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   The ICN board, which is being downsized from 12 to nine members,
will include six members who have strongly questioned Panic's
stewardship of the Costa Mesa company he founded 42 years ago. The
new board is expected to move quickly to oust Panic as CEO.</TE>
<TE>   Although ICN will not release the results of the proxy fight until
they have been certified, the company all but conceded at a
shareholder meeting that Panic had lost what probably was his last
battle to maintain control of the company.</TE>
<TE>   Oversight Committee</TE>
<TE>   to Monitor Vivendi CEO</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Universal's board of directors appointed key shareholder
and Vice Chairman Edgar Bronfman Jr. to a corporate governance
committee that will oversee Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier.</TE>
<TE>   The Bronfman family owns 5.3% of Vivendi and has been unhappy
about a significant falloff in its holdings as Vivendi's stock has
dropped 45% this year amid investor concerns about the company's
strategy and high debt load.</TE>
<TE>   Bronfman's heightened role comes six months after he cut his
day-to-day ties to Vivendi Universal. Bronfman headed Universal when
it was owned by his family's Seagram Co.</TE>
<TE>   A source close to the board said a key task of the committee will
be to monitor Messier's management of the company as it attempts to
regain investor confidence.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders Use</TE>
<TE>   Resolutions to Sound Off</TE>
<TE>   Angered by two years of bear market losses in stocks and a surge
in corporate scandals, investors are voting in favor of
shareholder-sponsored resolutions at a record pace this year.</TE>
<TE>   The nonbinding resolutions, which give shareholders a chance to
sound off on such issues as stock option plans, executive severance
packages and the separation of auditing and consulting contracts,
have gotten a majority of votes in 39% of this year's elections at
annual meetings, according to a proxy advisory service that tracks
the measures.</TE>
<TE>   The results so far exceed the previous record 25% approval rate of
two years ago, according to the Investor Responsibility Research
Center in Washington, which covers resolutions related to corporate
governance issues at 2,000 of the largest U.S. companies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Global Execs Offer</TE>
<TE>   Plan to Save Firm</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing Ltd. said it will propose a bankruptcy
reorganization plan that would revive the company without selling it.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement came just days after two key bidders for the
telecommunications company balked at substantially raising their
initial bid of $750 million for a 79% ownership stake. Other bidders
are expected to file offers by a June 20 deadline, with an auction
set for early July.</TE>
<TE>   John Legere, Global Crossing's chief executive, said the company's
creditors will consider the stand-alone proposal from Global Crossing
executives. Under that plan, the company's reemergence from
bankruptcy would be funded by a small equity investment and the
proceeds from the expected sale of three operations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Supreme Court Bolsters</TE>
<TE>   Protections for Patents</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court gave inventors wider latitude to sue makers
of competing products that don't exactly copy the original.</TE>
<TE>   The unanimous decision overturned an appeals court ruling and was
heralded by inventors and lawyers as the most important concerning
patents in decades.</TE>
<TE>   The decision affects about 1 million of the 1.2 million patents in
effect.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that allowing the appeals court
ruling to stand would "risk destroying the legitimate expectations of
inventors in their property."</TE>
<TE>   Several technology and biotech firms, including Sun Microsystems
Inc., Verizon Communications Inc., Pfizer Inc. and Dow Chemical Co.,
had urged the reversal of the appeals court decision.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   State Seeks to Fine</TE>
<TE>   Online Pharmacy</TE>
<TE>   California regulators have proposed an $88.7-million fine against
a Los Angeles pharmacy for selling medications directly to consumers
over the Internet without requiring a doctor's examination.</TE>
<TE>   The state Board of Pharmacy's sanction against Los Angeles-based
Total Remedy &amp; Prescription Center II, pharmacist-in-charge and
co-owner Barry Irvin and pharmacist William Packer must be approved
by the 11-member state medical board. The fine amounts to the maximum
$25,000 for each of about 3,500 prescriptions allegedly filled
illegally.</TE>
<TE>   The case represents the first use of a law passed in 2000 that
requires a "good faith prior medical examination" by a doctor
licensed in California before a prescription can be filled.</TE>
<TE>   Irvin, who called the charges "crazy," has 30 days to appeal.</TE>

<KH>EXECUTIVE PAY REPORT: Working to Retire Overcompensation</KH>
<HD>Some firms in Southland are tying CEO pay to performance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years of layoffs, sagging profits and falling stock prices took a
toll on executive pay at big Southland companies last year, a sign
that at some firms pay-for-performance plans finally are doing what
they're designed to do--cut executive compensation when times are
bad.</LD>
<LD>   More than a third of the chief executives included in a
compensation study of 100 large Southern California-based companies
took a cut in their cash pay last year; 10 received no increase in
salary or bonus. Almost half saw their overall pay package shrink as
the tumbling stock market prevented executives from exercising
lucrative stock options.</LD>
<LD>   "We are seeing less pay for less performance," said Don Sagolla,
compensation consultant with Mercer Human Resource Consulting in Los
Angeles, whose firm compiled the compensation study. "There were a
lot of pay cuts and a lot of shutouts where the executive got no
increase in salary or bonus."</LD>
<TE>   The Southland survey tracked what Mercer found in a recent
national study that examined executive pay at 350 large companies.
The median salary increase nationally last year was 4.7%, compared
with 5.3% in 2000. The median bonus was down 13% and total direct
compensation--which includes realized stock option gains--was down
0.9%.</TE>
<TE>   But the average pay cut wasn't exactly draconian. In Mercer's
Southern California study, the median cash compensation--meaning half
of the CEOs in the study were paid more and half less--actually rose
0.2% to $987,500. Total direct compensation--which was weighed down
by worthless stock options--declined 2%.</TE>
<TE>   By some measures, corporate performance was far worse. More than
half of the companies--52--in this year's survey either saw a decline
in net profits or an increase in net losses during 2001. One-third of
the companies also saw a decline in net sales. Dozens laid off
workers.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, executive pay remains generous. The median pay for these
100 executives was $1.36 million. That includes salary, bonus, the
value of restricted stock awards received during the year, plus the
net value of stock options exercised in 2001. Fifteen executives
earned more than $5 million for the year. Thirty-two earned more than
$2million.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Karatz, chief executive of L.A.-based home builder KB Home,
was at the top of the pay ranking. Karatz got $895,833 in salary and
a $6.6-million bonus, but that wasn't what made him No. 1. Like many
executives on the list, the key for Karatz was stock. He exercised
stock options, which had a market value that was $23.4 million more
than his exercise price, and he received restricted stock and stock
grants worth an additional $13.4 million, Mercer said.</TE>
<TE>   Karatz's total pay: $44.4 million. Assuming a grueling 80-hour
workweek, that comes to almost $11,000 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   With KB Home's stock up 19% in 2001--and almost 105% over the last
12 months--KB Home maintains Karatz has provided great value to
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcom Corp. CEO Henry T. Nicholas III was the
second-most-highly paid executive in the survey because he exercised
$25 million in Broadcom stock options. Although his cash pay was just
$111,000, he went home with a total package worth $25.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   By at least one measure, Nicholas counts as one of the region's
shutouts. He received no raise or bonus during 2001, possibly because
his company's sales declined 12.3%. The Irvine-based firm lost $2.7
billion during the year, and the company's stock plummeted 51%.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc. Chief Executive Henry C. Yuen
was third-best paid, earning $19.2 million, which included $4.6
million in salary and more than $14 million in stock options, plus
other compensation. But his pay really reflects 2000 data because the
Pasadena-based company holds mid-summer annual meetings and has not
yet published a proxy for 2001. In 2000, Yuen's firm lost
$213.1million versus a loss of $599.6 million in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Louis R. Tomasetta, chief executive of Camarillo-based Vitesse
Semiconductor Corp., was fourth-highest paid, with total direct
compensation of $15.9 million. Included in that figure was $955,000
in cash compensation--a 40% increase from the year before--and $14
million in stock gains.</TE>
<TE>   However, the company indicates in its proxy statement that the pay
was affected by a lag factor. The $638,663 bonus Tomasetta was paid
last year actually was earned in 2000, when the company reported a
profit of $27.9 million, contrasted with a net loss of $111.9million
in 2001. None of Vitesse's top executives earned a bonus for their
fiscal 2001 performance.</TE>
<TE>   Although Vitesse and other companies in the 2001 pay survey
provide evidence of moderation, the fairly modest decrease in total
compensation did little to cool industry and investor furor over what
many believe is runaway executive pay.</TE>
<TE>   "Ignoring these little statistical blips, the trend is up, up and
away," said Charles T. Munger, co-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway
Corp., CEO of Pasadena-based Wesco Financial Corp. and the
lowest-paid executive on The Times listing. "Executive pay is way out
of whack on the upside and desperately needs reining in."</TE>
<TE>   Critics say companies are finding increasingly hard-to-track ways
to pay their executives--putting millions into their supplemental
pensions, paying the interest on their loans and paying their
barbers, financial planners and pilots, for example.</TE>
<TE>   "There are these surreptitious forms of executive
compensation--like company loans and massive contributions to pension
plans--that we think are even worse than excessive pay because they
add even more to investor skepticism," said Bill Patterson, director
of the AFL/CIO office of investment.</TE>
<TE>   Companies concerned that stock options are falling victim to the
bear market are finding ways to cushion executives from dramatic
drops in the share price.</TE>
<TE>   At Broadcom, executives who received stock options when the
company's shares were trading at $118 suffered with shareholders when
Broadcom's stock plunged to less than $40, rendering their options
worthless.</TE>
<TE>   At least, they did until April 2001, when the company's board of
directors decided that the old options no longer provided a
sufficient incentive for managers, according to documents Broadcom
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The board canceled the old options and issued new ones--at the
lower market price--six months and a day later. (By using this
formula rather than "repricing" the options, as is often the
practice, Broadcom avoided running afoul of new accounting rules that
would require the firm to recognize the expense of this deal on the
company's income statement.)</TE>
<TE>   In a news release on the eve of the exchange to explain the
company's motives, Broadcom CEO Nicholas said, "With the current
economic slowdown and the recent drop in the market price of many
technology stocks, including Broadcom's, we believe that this is the
best way to continue to retain and motivate our most important asset,
our employees."</TE>
<TE>   That may be, but such deals also are motivating critics of
corporate pay packages.</TE>
<TE>   "The tolerance for runaway executive pay is diminishing,"
Patterson said.</TE>

<LD>Students at Barton Elementary in Long Beach offered these comments
and suggestions.</LD>
<LD>   * My uncle tells me there is something on my shirt, and when I
look, he flicks me in the face. He still teases me, but now I just
ignore him. (Madeleine, 8)</LD>
<LD>   * My brother teases me every day. He says stuff to trick me all
the time. I just tease him back. (Ali, 8)</LD>
<TE>   * My sister used to call me chicken. She didn't stop so I told my
dad and she doesn't tease me anymore. (Anthony, 7)</TE>
<TE>   * One day I was walking and my friend started teasing me. She said
I was stupid and lazy. I told her to stop but she kept on doing it. I
kept walking, but she followed me and teased me more. She didn't know
that I was going straight to her mom. I told on her and then I found
a new friend. It's OK because I didn't like her all that much.
(Nohelia, 7)</TE>
<TE>   * I was teased one day at recess by my friend. She said that I had
four eyes in my head. Then I said, "Don't call me four eyes!" She
didn't tease me again. (Khanh, 7)</TE>
<TE>   * My friend told me I had a spider on my head. I told him that it
was not right to tease people who are scared of things. He kept doing
it for a while, but then he stopped. (Sha-sha, 7)</TE>
<TE>   * Sometimes my brother calls me a whiny baby. I tell him, "I know
you are, but what am I?" (Misha, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * My big sister teases me by copying everything I say. I just
ignore her or walk away and she usually stops after a while. (Andrew,
8)</TE>
<TE>   * My brother teased me. He called me
"knuckle-head-glasses-duffas." I solved it by telling my mom. Now if
he teases me he gets into trouble. (Michael, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * My friend teased me after I got a new haircut. I said, "Well, I
like it and I think it is great!" Then she stopped teasing me because
she thought I was crazy. (Jennycel, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * My brother teased me. He said I couldn't kick. I told him that
wasn't true because I can kick better than he can and he is older
than me. (Krista, 8)</TE>

<DH>Protocol chief makes foreign guests, dignitaries feel at
home in Los Angeles</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Elga Sharpe knows how to eat the herring. And it is important to know
how to eat the herring. You pick it up by the tail with two fingers
and swoop it into the air just above your mouth, quickly so the sour
cream and chopped onions don't slide off. You tip your head back and
then lower the fish in whole, exactly as if you were a seal.</LD>
<LD>   It is a bit shocking to watch Sharpe do this, swiftly, expertly.
It is not a series of actions immediately associated with a
well-heeled cocktail soiree, and certainly not with Sharpe, who is a
woman of notable poise. But if she is eating like a seal, then that
must be the way it is done because she is the new chief of the
mayor's office of protocol, and knowing how to do things properly is
her job.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, all around the room men and women in dark suits and
cashmere twin sets are raising fish above their heads. A hundred or
so have gathered in a banquet room of the Petersen Automotive Museum
in honor of the birthday of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, which
explains the proficient consumption of the herring.</LD>
<TE>   The consul general of the Netherlands who put together the event
is not there (a sudden illness in his family), but many of his
colleagues are--diplomats from Austria, Indonesia, the Czech
Republic, Belgium, Liberia, Honduras, as well as many members of the
Dutch community in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   One of Sharpe's main duties is to aid the foreign missions in the
city, to help coordinate visits of dignitaries and represent the
mayor at functions such as this. She is relatively new to the
job--Mayor James K. Hahn appointed her in January--but she seems to
know most of the people here. She moves through the room fluidly,
chatting, plucking the occasional hors d'oeuvre from the endlessly
circulating platters but turning up a hand at the generous portions
of Danish vodka that are filling glasses in many guises. "Ooooh, no,"
she says, laughing, "dangerous, dangerous. I'm working."</TE>
<TE>   An hour into the after-work event, the deputy consul general of
the Netherlands is dutifully presented with a series of certificates,
from the L.A. County Board of Commissioners, from the city of Beverly
Hills and from the mayor's office. Stepping behind the lectern,
Sharpe, 52, quietly offers the mayor's congratulations on the
birthday of the queen and reads a bit from the document. Then, as she
hands it over, she repeats these things, and a few more good wishes,
only this time in Dutch. Not halting, just-memorized-from-the-Berlitz
tape Dutch. Fluid, flawless Dutch.</TE>
<TE>   If Madonna had just walked into the room, the crowd could not have
been more electrified. After the obligatory singing of the Dutch and
then the American national anthems, Sharpe was swarmed by people all
wanting to know the same thing: Where had she learned to speak their
language so well?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm from Aruba," she said again and again, the accent of the
Caribbean rolling out the R and U like breaking waves. "So I speak
the Dutch."</TE>
<TE>   And four other languages in addition to English--Spanish, French,
German and Papiamento, a Spanish creole with Dutch and Portuguese
influences. "In Aruba," she said, "children speak four languages by
the age of 5. And my parents always, always entertained all sorts of
interesting people. So I learned early the importance of manners, and
of understanding other people's ways."</TE>
<TE>   Much of Sharpe's background is sort of standard issue for the
diplomatic corps--after graduating college in Suriname, she studied
linguistics at schools in the Netherlands, France and Switzerland.
She worked for the Belgian Consulate in Toronto for several years and
then for Air Canada for 15 years, often coordinating the visits of
foreign dignitaries. There she met and married musician Bill Sharpe.
"We met at a dinner party, found out we shared the same birthday, and
the rest is history," she said. "People find out we've been married
22 years, they say, 'What? To a musician?'"</TE>
<TE>   The two moved to Los Angeles in 1986 when Sharpe headed language
and translation services for Warner Bros., the 1994 World Cup USA
Organizing Committee and, most recently, DreamWorks. After taking
several years off to be home with her son, who is now 10, Sharpe
began watching Hahn's campaign. She had closely followed the career
of his father, longtime county Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, she said,
"and I decided I wanted to work for this man."</TE>
<TE>   So she submitted her resume and waited. After a month or two, she
got the call.</TE>
<TE>   "Elga is a key part of our team," Mayor Hahn said. "She is the
perfect liaison between my office and our large international
community."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Sharpe has been out and about virtually every day and
every night attending consulate functions and meeting the 86 career
and honorary consul generals in L.A., overseeing the reception of
dignitaries, including an unofficial visit from Jordan's King
Abdullah II and Queen Rania al Abdullah, and filling her new office
and database with names, numbers and resources that range from
private lines to the State Department to dictionaries in every
language to etiquette guides. Her first call, she said, was to Ginger
Barnard, who has worked with the diplomatic community for more than
20 years. She soon became assistant deputy of protocol for Los
Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever I have a question, and I have many, I ask Ginger,"
Sharpe said. "She knows everyone and everything."</TE>
<TE>   In dress-down Los Angeles, it's hard to imagine a definition of
protocol beyond VIP parking passes. But when you consider that more
than 36% of county residents were born in other countries, well, then
it becomes less an issue of not enough protocol than of too many
protocols. Barnard has a half-dozen etiquette books in her office, as
well as guides to every country imaginable.</TE>
<TE>   "Letitia Baldrige is usually pretty good," she said, "but mostly
we use 'The Modern Guide to Business Etiquette.'"</TE>
<TE>   Which makes perfect sense, since everyone, including Sharpe and
Barnard, agrees that modern diplomacy, especially in L.A., is much
more about business than image or manners. The diplomatic
uniform--blue blazer, gray trousers for the men, dark suit for the
women--these days is reserved for visits from heads of state. West
Coast business is more Banana Republic than Brooks Bros. Still, there
is protocol that must be adhered to, and Sharpe and Barnard are there
to make certain that no faux pas are made.</TE>
<TE>   "Here we are a little more casual," Sharpe said, "but still you
have to follow the rules."</TE>
<TE>   Such rules as when to sit and when to stand, and not to shake the
hand of a head of state before it is fully extended, rules like who
gets gifts and what sort (never give a Chinese diplomat a clock,
Sharpe said, because to them it is a symbol of death), when a curtsey
is appropriate and when it is not.</TE>
<TE>   "I would always tend to overdo than underdo," she said. "But that
is just me."</TE>
<TE>   Before a visit from a foreign dignitary, Sharpe briefs the mayor
on phrases and customs and what to expect in terms of ritual. She
also is in charge of arranging meetings between the mayor and the
diplomatic community, of deciding what countries the mayor will
visit, which international events he will attend, and when he will
meet with each consul general.</TE>
<TE>   She spends a lot of her time saying no, in the nicest way
possible.</TE>
<TE>   "There are almost 90 national day celebrations alone every year,"
she said. "There are worthy events going on every single day. But
this is just one part of the mayor's duties. An important part, but
just one."</TE>
<TE>   When the mayor does attend an event, Sharpe goes with him; when he
does not, she often goes in his place, making presentations or simply
mingling among the guests.</TE>
<TE>   As glamorous as it might sound to be out one night at the Vienna
Philharmonic and at a Jamaican barbecue the next, it is not the
easiest job in the world for a working mother. After putting together
the mayor's annual reception of the entire consular corps recently,
Sharpe was so exhausted at the end of the evening she could barely
drive herself home. "And then I was so wired I couldn't sleep until
1." But she was up five hours later looking for her son's science
book.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still a full-time job, motherhood," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But motherhood is perhaps one of the best preparations for a life
dedicated to public service and good manners. In addition to aiding
the various foreign missions and visitors, Sharpe works with
representatives of the 20 cities L.A. calls "sister," including
Athens; Bordeaux, France; Giza, Egypt; St. Petersburg, Russia; and
Taipei, Taiwan, putting together delegations and scheduling events
and talking to officials from cities interested in joining the
family.</TE>
<TE>   In between, Sharpe and Barnard field questions from a wide array
of sources--a diplomat's spouse who wants to know where a good
hairstylist is, the owner of an apartment building who needs to know
what order the flags should be in ("We get a lot of calls about
flags," said Barnard), the Chinese relations committee looking for
young people in creative fields to attend a conference in Santa
Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't know, you find the answers," Sharpe said. "In
America, protocol always seems foreign, but we need to have our own.
Part of my hope is not only to educate people about how those in
other countries behave, but also to develop a very specific set of
our own, of Los Angeles protocol."</TE>
<TE>   Forget the herring; let's see a group of well-dressed diplomats
eat a grunion or two.</TE>

California Living about Elga Sharpe, the chief of protocol for Los
Angeles, an incorrect title was given for Sharpe's assistant. Ginger
Barnard is deputy chief of protocol. The same story mentioned a board
of commissioners, which should have been a reference to the L.A.

<DH>Survivors' stories, some hundreds of years old, are helping
scientists understand earthquakes</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RENEE TAWA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Live here long enough, and you'll hear the stories
unfold--compulsively, reflexively--as part of the local lore, as part
of the way we wrap earthquakes into the culture of California. The
trip wires are everywhere, 10 seconds after a quake when neighbors
circle each others' driveways, or 10 years later, as was the case on
a May weekend in the Mojave Desert.</LD>
<LD>   Under a broiling sun, on a daylong field trip, 60-year-old Paul
Smith and other locals listened to the science of what happened in
the 7.3-magnitude Landers earthquake--and then layered the
information with their memories of that morning in June 1992: "My
wife ran outside in front of the yard, stark naked, her 10-year-old
son wrapped in her arms like this ... " began Smith, an attorney.</LD>
<LD>   The way we think about earthquakes, sociologists say, is shaped by
influences such as science and popular culture, and by the stories
that are passed on to help make sense of the literal and figurative
shifting of the world beneath our feet. Now, the stories that people
tell about earthquakes, in centuries-old villages and in wired
California cities, are taking on new significance. In a wide-ranging
field of study, from seismology to sociology, earth scientists and
other researchers, who once ignored or overlooked local lore and
myths, now are using the stories in their work.</LD>
<TE>   In one project, stories told by Native Americans from far Northern
California to British Columbia played a part in leading scientists to
a blockbuster finding--evidence of a devastating earthquake in 1700.
Scientists had not previously known about the quake, one of the
world's largest at an estimated magnitude of 9, in the Pacific Coast
region.</TE>
<TE>   In another project, university researchers are reviewing
narratives filed online by California residents in the past 10 years,
some of whom provide striking accounts of big earthquakes. The
stories are giving researchers an idea of how people think and react
when the shaking begins--potentially valuable information in
retooling disaster information campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Whether told by Northridge residents or by Hoh tribal
storytellers, the stories can sound strikingly similar. Some rely on
enduring literary devices such as simple words, vivid images and
cultural metaphor:</TE>
<TE>   * Three hundred years ago or so, a battle between the mighty
thunderbird and an evil whale shook the land, a Hoh tribal tale
begins, said University of Washington research scientist Ruth Ludwin.
Her research suggests that the medicine man who told the story to an
ethnographer in the early 1900s added an oral history account: "There
was ... great and crashing thunder-noise everywhere ... there was
also a great shaking, jumping up and trembling of the earth beneath,
and a rolling up of the great waters."</TE>
<TE>   * In a written observation, a Hollywood resident compared the
6.7-magnitude Northridge quake in 1994 to "having your house
drop-kicked like a football with the most violent and deep force you
can think of, then imagine how you clean salad in a colander; after
rinsing it, you shake it back and forth, up and down to get rid of
the water. Add to that almost instant total darkness, the most
bizarre and frightening, screeching, groaning, cracking and exploding
sounds ... "</TE>
<TE>   Emergency managers in Washington and Oregon are thinking about how
to use the thunderbird stories--featuring a supernatural figure who
fires off thunder and lightning--in public education campaigns on the
area's susceptibility to another deadly, tsunami-causing quake, said
Ludwin, a seismologist who has published a paper on using the Native
American oral traditions in scientific applications. In the past six
months, she has spoken to more than a dozen groups of the topic.</TE>
<TE>   "Eyewitness testimony helps people believe that these events are
real," Ludwin said. "I think stories are innately appealing to the
human imagination.... We love a good story."</TE>
<TE>   The drumbeat sounds throughout California: The Big One is coming.
(According to U.S. Geological Survey scientists, there's a 60%
probability that a major quake will strike Southern California in the
next 30 years). In the town of Parkfield, which sits on the San
Andreas fault in Central California, a faux water tower is painted
with the slogan: "Earthquake Capitol of the World ... Be Here When It
Happens." In downtown Los Angeles, Epicentre restaurant, which
promotes a "playful earthquake motif," offers a "San Andreas Soup,"
or two kinds of bean puree separated by a jagged line of sour cream.</TE>
<TE>   And throughout California, you hear the lore: hot and dry days
known as "shake-and-bake time," or "earthquake weather"; or barking
dogs who tip off their owners to impending ground motion.</TE>
<TE>   Worldwide, communities that live through a major disaster
typically produce some kind of cultural representation of the event,
through means including the exchange of myths and urban legends, said
Gary R. Webb, an assistant professor of sociology at Oklahoma State
University. Since the late 1990s, a small group of sociologists has
been focusing on "the popular culture of disaster," in areas
including black humor and stories that are passed down through the
generations.</TE>
<TE>   Their work is part of an emerging field of study focusing on how,
for instance, the public and politicians absorb the threat of
potential disaster. If the threat is not taken seriously, Webb said,
"then we won't feel compelled to get ready for them," and the need to
strengthen building codes or take other preparedness measures will
not top the public agenda. "Scientific and technological innovation
alone will not prevent future disasters from occurring," he said. "We
have to understand the worldviews of people who live in
disaster-prone areas in order to understand how they perceive the
problem and what they believe should be done about it." Part of the
reason that myths endure is that people still can think of
earthquakes as a mysterious force and look around them to fill in the
blanks, said Kimberley Shoaf, director of research at the UCLA Center
for Public Health and Disasters. "If you see something happening, you
make that association in your brain: 'My dog barked [as a tip-off]
before the last earthquake' ... and some of that might be that
science isn't in the control of human beings. 'I can't stop the Earth
from moving. I can't look inside the Earth. I can hear dogs
barking.... There's the science, and my brain can get around that,
but there has got to be something more.'"</TE>
<TE>   Before--and, sometimes, after--science stepped in to explain the
bewildering force of colliding tectonic plates, people told stories
to make sense of their world.</TE>
<TE>   "The great thunderbird finally carried the [whale] to its nest in
the lofty mountains, and there was the final and terrible contest
fought. Here in this death struggle, they uprooted all the trees for
many miles around the nest and also pulled the rocks down the great
Hoh valley ... "</TE>
<TE>   --Hoh and Quileute story cited in Ludwin's seismology research ;
the story was recorded by an ethnographer in 1934</TE>
<TE>   Caltech's Thomas Heaton had not planned to cull from Native
American legends when he began investigating the seismic history of
the Pacific Northwest. "The story of discovering the giant earthquake
of the winter of 1700 ... is pretty amazing," Heaton said.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of the discovery, which entailed a massive collaborative
effort, first was announced in 1995. Scientists pointed out that such
a "megathrust subduction quake"--in which a tectonic plate slides
under the continent--tends to recur every few hundred years. Since
then, under the threat of a comparable disaster along the undersea
Cascadia thrust fault, officials in the Pacific Northwest have posted
new tsunami warning signs, upgraded building codes and taken other
preparedness measures.</TE>
<TE>   Ludwin still is perusing the Native American stories for possible
leads on earthquakes, catastrophic landslides or tsunamis that
scientists have not yet documented. Some of the stories indicate a
time frame by mentioning a season, moon phase or tide level and give
specific locations that can be searched for paleoseismic evidence,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Heaton, a professor of engineering seismology, took on the
original research in 1982 as part of a license application review for
a nuclear power plant. The applicants argued that the Pacific
Northwest was not prone to such a massive quake. But though Heaton's
initial research on geologic features of the land suggested that the
Pacific coast, from British Columbia to far Northern California,
could be at risk, traditional research sources, he found, had not
recorded such a disaster. So he turned to another possible source,
referred to him by a colleague--in a 1868 book by James Swan, a
schoolteacher who wrote about his life with the Makah tribe at Neah
Bay on Washington's northwestern peninsula. Swan wrote that the
Makahs had spoken of a big flood, not as a mythological event
involving the thunderbird or other familiar figures, but as an event
that was part of their oral history. Before the flood, the Makahs
told Swan that Cape Flattery, which is on the tip of the peninsula,
had been an island. "The implication," Heaton said, "was that the
ground had been uplifted as a result of this flood event."</TE>
<TE>   With the Makah story in mind, U.S. Geological Survey scientist
Brian Atwater headed to Neah Bay to analyze geologic deposits for
evidence of seismic activity. For the next 10 years, Atwater and a
team of researchers studied the deposits and eventually determined
that the area's sea level changes had been caused by earthquakes, the
most recent of which had struck in 1700. Meanwhile, another
researcher in Japan had discovered that a mysterious tsunami had hit
Japan in the same year; scientists later linked the tsunami to the
earthquake cited by the Makahs.</TE>
<TE>   In another piece of the puzzle, researcher Deborah Carver and her
husband, Gary, a professor emeritus of geology at Humboldt State,
investigated stories told by the Yurok people and others in far
Northern California and unearthed descriptions of an earthquake and
tsunami that wiped out a village. With the permission of Yurok
elders, the Carvers explored a site on sacred Indian land in Redwood
National Park. Tsunami sand deposits there dated back to the 1700
earthquake, Gary Carver said.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, for the past three months, officials have been
meeting with Makah representatives about how to wrap their oral
histories into preparedness campaigns, said George Crawford,
earthquake program manager for the state's Division of Emergency
Management. The Makahs suggested that their tribal storytellers could
help, perhaps by relating the lessons of their ancestors at public
events.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford, who loves the idea, said the Makah elders would be able
to tell the story of the historic disaster in a way that, perhaps,
science cannot. "You can tell me that we had an earthquake in 1700
and a big tsunami," he said. "It's a different story when you get
someone to say, 'My forebears were there, and this is what happened,
and this is what we tell our children.'"</TE>
<TE>   "I heard a loud boom and then my bed was thrown into the air,
almost to the ceiling...Then the sound of a million chains or trains
followed by shaking, which became more and more intense. At first it
felt like it was south-north, then west-east, then almost like a
giant had the building and shook it.... "</TE>
<TE>   --Mission Hills resident's take on the Northridge quake, which
left 57 dead, more than 11,000 injured and damage exceeding $40
billion</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Geological Survey scientists weren't sure what to do with the
100,000-plus unofficial observations on earthquakes--from conspiracy
theorists, who insisted that Caltech was lowballing magnitude
estimates, and from the ultra-precise, written four years after the
Northridge quake: "The baby grand piano, which was sitting on a
padded, carpeted concrete slab floor, rotated on one leg, by about
41/2 degrees, in a counter-clockwise direction (i.e., from east
toward north). This was determined by observing and measuring the
final position of the piano legs from the previous indentations which
they had left in the carpet."</TE>
<TE>   The firsthand reports have been filed since 1998 through a USGS
Web site, earthquake.usgs.gov, under "Report an Earthquake," as part
of a system that gives scientists and emergency response officials
another tool to help pinpoint where a quake was felt and how strongly
it shook. Based on voluntary questionnaires filed by residents after
significant quakes, the online system produces color-coded maps every
few minutes, depicting the areas hardest hit. The system, titled "Did
You Feel It," also invites brief submissions about past earthquakes.
(The responses are not posted publicly.)</TE>
<TE>   Most submissions appear to be from earnest residents who are eager
to "be part of the process," said USGS seismologist David Wald. "It
offers the opportunity to write down and share your [stories] .... I
find it amazing. I didn't expect that to be a part of it. People want
to give you more than [the questionnaire data]."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists, who suspected that the stories had research potential,
turned the submissions over last year to a team at Cal State Long
Beach that had been interviewing people for a study on how the public
factors the threat of an earthquake into their lives. (Earthquake
preparedness information sources include the Southern California
Earthquake Center, www.scec.org.</TE>
<TE>   Professor Richard Celsi and a colleague now are reviewing more
than 7,000 first-person accounts of the quakes in Northridge,
Landers, Big Bear in 1992 and Napa Valley's Yountville in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Their analysis could help emergency planners figure out what kind
of public education is needed and look for patterns of behavior that
might need to be addressed, Celsi said. "Maybe give them ideas on how
to bridge these questions everyone has: to scare or not to scare. How
much do you say?" (The same question is being weighed by public
officials, such as Gov. Gray Davis, in the face of heightened
sensitivity to terrorist threats; last fall, Davis was criticized for
issuing vague alerts about potential threats to four major bridges,
Celsi pointed out.)</TE>
<TE>   In preliminary observations of the earthquake filings, Celsi has
noted that people tend to overestimate the intensity of the shaking,
compared with scientific data and maps that indicate what the ground
motion was in the ZIP codes that the volunteers provide. Part of the
reason has to do with a "kind of California coolness" that longtime
residents adopt after living through a series of quakes without harm,
he said. "We anchor from our own experiences; we anchor to what we
felt before." The ennui is fed by calls from friends and relatives
back East who check in after an earthquake makes news. "[Residents]
experienced this, and other people haven't, and that puts them as
part of a community and gives them a sense of hubris or esprit in
describing these things," Celsi said. "You don't want to sound like a
tourist--you start to take in these experiences that make you a
Californian."</TE>
<TE>   But the complacency can turn into terror when a person rides out a
quake near the epicenter. "People are surprised sometimes by the
sheer force when they're close to [even] a small earthquake," Celsi
said. "Their narratives and stories will tell you, their perspectives
of earthquakes have changed forever. The coolness has left."</TE>
<TE>   The stories are told, passed on, weighed in with a groaning mental
file of earthquake information. In the Mojave Desert, scientist Bob
Reynolds gave a sobering talk on the Landers quake on a Saturday in
May during the $50 tour offered through the Desert Institute at
Joshua Tree National Park. Then the 11 participants took the lead:</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking that all the buildings are just going to be
leveled..." "When you looked at the San Bernardino Mountains, it
looked like they were on fire, with all that dust that came up...."</TE>

<HD>Black Grad Night Is About Pride, Not Separatism</HD>

<LD>The young man across the banquet table looked to be about 13, eyes
serious behind wire-rimmed glasses as he sat stiffly in suit and tie
on an evening when most boys his age were probably kicking back,
watching the Laker game on TV.</LD>
<LD>   Flanked by his grandparents, he watched an unlikely procession of
graduating college students strutting across the stage collecting
accolades.</LD>
<LD>   There was the young woman who thanked her mother and infant son,
the baby born during her senior year. The young man whose journey
through college was interrupted by a prison term but who returned to
graduate cum laude.  The middle-aged woman who squeezed her classes
in around the needs of her kids, and stuck it out for 15 years.</LD>
<TE>   They were honored for grades, leadership, community service. But
the real stars of the evening were not on the dais at the Black Grad
Dinner preceding the Cal State Long Beach commencement, but in the
seats around me at the banquet tables.</TE>
<TE>   "Your family, your community is at the center of this night," said
our host, Maulana Karenga, head of the university's black studies
department and creator of the holiday Kwanzaa. "Your accomplishments
are wonderful, and we are very proud of you. But you must be grateful
to them, as well."</TE>
<TE>   And as the boy across from me rose to applaud, he studied the face
of his grandfather, whose eyes glowed with pride, or maybe tears.</TE>
<TE>   Some might say that these special-interest ceremonies have
proliferated to the point that they cease to be special.</TE>
<TE>   Although most students also participate in campus-wide ceremonies,
some argue that the number of private celebrations--for example, to
honor graduates who are black, gay, Iranian or in ROTC--are taking
away the sense of unity that used to accompany graduation.</TE>
<TE>   They promote separatism, critics say; they encourage
Balkanization. Some bristle at the sight of African kente cloth and
Mexican flags, at the sound of the Filipino national anthem, at gay
students' declarations of affection.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand that people doubt the necessity of events such as
these," says USC junior Kelechi Okoro, who coordinated USC's black
graduation ceremony this year. "But they're welcome to come to see
for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   The cultural ceremonies, said Karenga, "are not exclusive events,
but inclusive events that honor the families, the friends and
community that have supported these young people. A lot of these
students are the first in their families to graduate and have
persevered despite overwhelming obstacles."</TE>
<TE>   It is easy to feel lost in a crowd of thousands--which is the size
of graduating classes at large universities.</TE>
<TE>   At private schools such as USC, there is "the struggle of going
through four or five years being the only African American in your
classes," Okoro says. "Every student has that experience, and it can
be tough. Our fellow graduates, and our families and friends, have a
better understanding of what it's taken for us to reach graduation."</TE>
<TE>   And for every round of applause for a graduate, there is a chorus
of "thank you" for a family.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how intelligent you may think you are, how hard you
work, how diligent you are, how creative you may be, none of us would
be here had it not been for the sacrifices and struggles of our
families. This event is as much a time to acknowledge and thank them
as it is to congratulate ourselves for our achievements."</TE>
<TE>   Those words are from the speech my brother gave at his own black
grad dinner 15 years ago at Stanford University. My father, then
terminally ill, had checked out of the hospital in Ohio and traveled
3,000 miles for what he would later say was the proudest moment of
his life.</TE>
<TE>   I wish that all those who have complained about the divisiveness
of special celebrations could have felt the pride and power in that
room, as men and women who cleaned toilets and picked cotton and
hauled garbage celebrated with sons and daughters who would become
doctors and lawyers and university professors.</TE>
<TE>   And I wonder why no one calls it balkanization when we separate
inmates in jail by race, or stack honors classes with smart, white
kids while bright but unmotivated black kids fail.</TE>
<TE>   Is it balkanization to remind young people that their success is
built on the sacrifices of previous generations? Whom does it
threaten when we encourage them to reach back and mentor others, like
the young man sitting at my dinner table with his grandparents? Is it
disruptive to demonstrate that a mistake need not derail a dream,
that your past need not limit your future, that perseverance is your
legacy?</TE>
<TE>   There were no mortarboards tossed toward the sky at last weekend's
black graduation. But there were countless dreams unleashed, as hope
marched forward on strong black shoulders.</TE>

<LD>It was a room full of lawyers--but nobody was arguing. Nearly 800
attendees, many from the city's top law firms, gathered to honor real
estate executive Steve Soboroff and Judge William P. Hogoboom for
their civic involvement at the Constitutional Rights Foundation's
annual spring dinner.</LD>
<LD>   The event raised more than $850,000 for the foundation, which has
been sponsoring hands-on educational programs on the Constitution and
the Bill of Rights in area schools for 40 years. Students were among
the guests at the dinner, which included a display of their school
projects ranging from the Boston Tea Party to the Nuremberg trials to
Beatlemania.</LD>
<LD>   Among those impressed: writer Michael Beschloss, the keynote
speaker at the dinner. Beschloss, who is currently working on a
history of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, admitted he was
bowled over by their knowledge. "A couple of those kids knew more
than I did about the assassination," he said. "I actually got some
research done here!"</LD>
<TE>   Soboroff received the foundation's Bill of Rights Award, presented
by Getty Museum executive Harold M. Williams. Soboroff, president of
Playa Vista and a candidate for mayor in the last election, is former
president of the L.A. Recreation and Parks Commission and chairman
emeritus of Big Brothers. Hogoboom received the Lloyd M. Smith Award,
presented by Judge Raymond C. Fisher. Hogoboom is the retired
presiding judge of the Los Angeles County Court and a former
president of the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation also recognized the contributions of teachers by
honoring the dedication of four: Helen Doherty of Bridges Community
Day School in Charter Oak; Lee Rosenthal of Jefferson Middle School
in San Gabriel; Glenn West of Belmont High School in L.A.; and Cheryl
Greer-Davis of Chavez-Tubman High School in Compton.</TE>
<TE>   Jess Marlow, host of KCET's "Life and Times," emceed the event at
the Century Plaza Hotel May 22; Joseph A. Calabrese, John A.
Kronstadt and Lester W. Olson were co-chairs.</TE>

<TE>   Quite Relevant</TE>
<TE>   Paul T. Salata, the man whose idea it was to celebrate the last
player selected in the NFL draft each year--an idea that has become
part of football tradition--was the honoree at a gala dinner that
raised $100,000 for the Orange County chapters of Goodwill Industries
and the American Red Cross.</TE>
<TE>   Salata, a former football player, created "Irrelevant Week" in
1976. "The underdog didn't get much action--and the last guy is as
good as the first--so we decided to honor him," explained Salata, who
also founded the Orange County Youth Sports Foundation, a nonprofit
that has raised millions for scholarships and athletic programs.</TE>
<TE>   Salata received the American Tribute Award at the benefit, which
began with a "Pre-Game Warm-Up" reception and entertainment by the
USC Trojan Marching Band and featured a portrayal of the "four
quarters" of Salata's life--from his years at Franklin High in Los
Angeles to the mid-'70s, when he created Irrelevant Week.</TE>
<TE>   Guests attending the May 23 event at the Grove of Anaheim dined on
filet mignon at tables crowned with T-shaped pipes-- a nod to
Salata's career as a pipeline contractor--filled with sprays of
orchids. Table favors were packaged trading cards featuring
photographs from Salata's life.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul is an inspiration because of the generous way he has lived,"
said Dan Rogers, president and chief executive officer of Goodwill
Industries of Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Seventy-five percent of the proceeds will go toward Goodwill's
programs for the disabled; the remainder will be used for the Red
Cross' emergency disaster relief services.</TE>

<TE>   Listening to Fugard</TE>
<TE>   The cast of "Sorrows and Rejoicings," Athol Fugard's play about a
South African expatriate poet, joined with theater supporters in
celebrating the show's Los Angeles opening at the Mark Taper Forum.</TE>
<TE>   Actor John Glover, who portrays the play's lead character, Dawid,
had high praise for Fugard. "Athol creates a spirit that is quite
unique. It's not just the actors, it infects everybody in the
rehearsal room," he said. "Some people believe that Dawid is more
personal to him than any other role he has created. It could be
intimidating if it weren't for Athol. But, he's so generous, I just
shut up and listen."</TE>
<TE>   Fugard didn't join the party, but Glover's co-stars, Judith Light,
Brienin Nequa Bryant and Cynthia Martells, were there on May 23 to
mix it up at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion's Impresario Room. Light,
who participated in a 100-mile AIDS trek in South Africa just before
starting rehearsals, said she feels that she will be "connected to
South Africa forever."</TE>
<TE>   Among the first-nighters spotted were Gina Hecht and Jason
Alexander, Judith and Rene Auberjonois, Angela Bassett, Joan Van Ark
and John Marshall, Mary Jo Catlett, Yvette Freeman, Richard
Libertini, Ric Salinas and Herbert Siguenza of Culture Clash,
Christina Pickles, Lawrence Pressman and Jane Wyatt.</TE>

<TE>   'Turandot' Turnout</TE>
<TE>   The buzz at the party following the premiere of "Turandot"
revolved around composer Luciano Berio's new ending to Puccini's
warhorse. Some liked it; some didn't. But with or without the new
spin, "Turandot" is regarded as a benchmark for L.A. Opera. "It was
in 1984, the year of the Olympics, when I appeared in the Covent
Garden production of 'Turandot' in Los Angeles," recalled artistic
director Placido Domingo. "The opera was so well received that Peter
Hemmings became general director, and that marked the real beginning
of this company."</TE>
<TE>   Joining the cast at the party in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion's
Impresario Room following the May 25 opener were Berio's daughter,
Christina; conductor Kent Nagano; and Rosemary and Milton Okun,
sponsors of the production with Cherry Lane Music and the Opera
League of Los Angeles. Other partygoers included Marta Domingo, Kara
Fox, Leonard Green, Tara Colburn, Cat and Elisabeth Pollon, Richard
Colburn, Melody and Warren Schubert, Alyce Williamson, Alicia and Ed
Clark, Lenore and Bernie Greenberg, Robyn and Mel Gibson, and Noriko
and Masaharu Kohno, consul general of Japan in Los Angeles.</TE>

<TE>   Design Matters</TE>
<TE>   The plan Richard Koshalek, president of Art Center College of
Design, shared is grand enough to reshape a city: "Pasadena is going
to be our Oxford," he told luncheon guests. "We're going to define it
as the 'education city,' and Art Center is going to be pivotal
because it will become an international institution with a
cross-disciplinary curriculum."</TE>
<TE>   Koshalek was addressing members of Art Center 100, a group of
leading supporters of the college, gathered for their annual luncheon
May 22.</TE>
<TE>   His blueprint includes the implementation of a new program called
Design Matters, which will encourage students to seek solutions to
problems surrounding water, housing and medical care. The plan calls
for collaboration with the city of Pasadena, Caltech and the
Huntington Library and includes two new satellite campuses for public
education: the 87,000-square-foot Dacor building on Raymond Avenue
and the abandoned five-acre Pasadena power plant.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayors of Rio de Janeiro and Barcelona are architects,"
Koshalek said. "We intend to attract the most gifted students in the
world and develop them into the creative leaders of the future."</TE>

<LD>When Donnie came to the breakfast table on Thursday morning, his mom
and dad sang "Happy Birthday." His bowl of cereal had a candle
standing in it.</LD>
<LD>   "We'll put all 10 candles on your cake tonight," Mom said. "But I
thought it would be fun to start the day with at least one."</LD>
<LD>   "This is a very special birthday for you, Donnie," Dad said.</LD>
<TE>   "What's so special about it?" asked Charlie, Donnie's younger
brother.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to guess." Donnie wondered if Charlie would get it.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it because you're 10 years old today and not some other
number?" Charlie asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes."</TE>
<TE>   Charlie thought hard for a moment. Then he asked, "Will it happen
to me when I'm 10?"</TE>
<TE>   Donnie thought Charlie had it. "Yes."</TE>
<TE>   Charlie grinned. "I know. You're really an alien and aliens always
melt on 10th birthdays."</TE>
<TE>   Charlie had a weird sense of humor. "Guess again," Donnie said.</TE>
<TE>   "I give up," Charlie said. "Tell me."</TE>
<TE>   "Well ... ," Donnie teased.</TE>
<TE>   "Come on, Donnie, tell me. Now."</TE>
<TE>   "OK." Donnie waited until he thought Charlie would burst. Then he
said, "Today is my first double-digit birthday. Today I am two
numbers instead of one."</TE>
<TE>   "So?" Charlie shrugged. "Anybody knows 10 is a double-digit
number."</TE>
<TE>   "But I'll always be a double digit from now on," Donnie answered.
"Until ... until I'm a triple digit."</TE>
<TE>   "Wow." Charlie was silent for a moment. "I have to wait two years
until I'm a double digit," he said. "How long do you have to wait
until you're a triple digit?"</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety years," Donnie said.</TE>
<TE>   "Double wow," Charlie said. "That's a long time to wait."</TE>
<TE>   "Time flies when you're having fun."</TE>

<HD>The Jarvis Effect</HD>
<DH>The kind of populism that gave birth to Prop. 13 is
apparent in the Valley secession movement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL BOYARSKY</AU>
<BD>Bill Boyarsky, former city editor and columnist for The
Times, is senior consultant for the Center for Governmental Studies
and a lecturer at the University of Southern California's Annenberg
School for Communications. He is writing a biography of the late
California political leader, Jesse M. Unruh.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On San Fernando Valley nights lately, if you have a long memory, you
can almost sense Howard Jarvis' ghost prowling the shopping centers
and suburban neighborhoods where he found recruits for his
Proposition 13, the state constitutional amendment that has forever
limited the growth of government in California.</LD>
<LD>   Jarvis was the prototype neighborhood character, a loud,
unmannerly, cantankerous former pro boxer who loved a stiff drink
almost as much as he loved bending his neighbors' ears about crooked
politicians and spendthrift bureaucrats.</LD>
<LD>   He was out of place among the political, business and journalistic
elite, who dismissed him as one of the crazy gadflies who turn out to
rant at Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors meetings. But he
would have been the life of the party on a recent warm spring night
when the Old Granada Hills Residents' Group hosted a debate on Valley
secession at a 1950s-style shopping center busy with people rushing
to the local Trader Joe's before closing time.</LD>
<TE>   More than 225 people gathered that night in the shopping center's
community room to listen to lawyer Bill Powers, from the
pro-secession group Valley VOTE, argue with political consultant
Larry Levine of the anti-secession One Los Angeles organization.</TE>
<TE>   It was just the kind of populist gathering Jarvis would have
loved. Questions from the floor reflected a feeling that downtown had
no respect for the issues driving the secession movement and
threatening the residents' group goal "to maintain, improve and
preserve our unique neighborhood." One man objected to the "alimony"
payments that a new city would have to pay to Los Angeles. Another
complained about the Sunshine Canyon garbage dump, east of Granada
Hills, another about a Chatsworth development proposed by City Hall
political power Ted Stein. A retired school principal conceded that,
while secession itself would not break up the Los Angeles Unified
School District, it could be a step in that direction. "Once the vote
is held here, and it will be overwhelming," he said, "we can tell the
Legislature we can have a school district like L.A. once was."</TE>
<TE>   The spare room in the northern reaches of the Valley and the
casually clad crowd seated in folding chairs seemed so remote from
City Hall that they could well have been in another city already.</TE>
<TE>   That feeling of separateness has made the Valley a prime
recruiting ground for the grass-roots protest movements that
periodically sweep through California. "There's something about
Valley people when they are organized," said Cal State Northridge
professor Tom Hogen-Esch, who studies secession movements. "These are
people who feel disrespected. They are fighting for respect, in a
sense."</TE>
<TE>   Personally, I'd like L.A. to stay together. I've reported from
each community in the Valley, and they all contribute to the city's
greatness. But as I listened at the Granada Hills meeting, I
sympathized. This was politics as it's supposed to be--people
expressing themselves with a clarity and force that has been drained
from the television commercials and speeches of today's campaigns. I
felt the same when I walked into a crowded Jarvis headquarters in
1977 and met the Valleyites leading one of the nation's great tax
revolts--people who'd never made it into the address books of
political journalists. Jarvis and his crew proved that you didn't
need to be on the political inside if you worked hard enough for a
cause you believed in.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyer Richard Close, chairman of Valley VOTE and president of the
Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., remembers those days too. Property
taxes were skyrocketing. The state had a huge and growing budget
surplus. Neither the Legislature nor Gov. Jerry Brown could or would
offer help. The Sherman Oaks group joined with other neighborhood
organizations, collecting 200,000 protest letters in "Brown Bags."
They took them from the Valley to Sacramento in a caravan of cars and
pickup trucks and tried to meet with Brown, getting as far as his
chief of staff, Gray Davis, the current governor. "Nothing happened,"
Close said.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Jarvis. He attended a Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn.
meeting and urged members to sign his petitions. "We had no other
options," Close said.</TE>
<TE>   If Valley secession has a Jarvis, Close is the man. I doubt if he
mixes strong Bloody Marys for a reporter during an afternoon
interview, as Jarvis did. And his background is different--law
school, the Wharton School, years of legal practice. But, like
Jarvis, he never concedes a point in a debate or a discussion. Nor
does he give his opponent a chance to make a point. It's attack,
attack, attack, just as the old anti-tax crusader did a quarter of a
century ago.</TE>
<TE>   The secession movement is further blessed with opponents who feed
Close's image of them as elitists and insiders. Most of them would
need MapQuest or a Thomas Bros. Guide to find their way to Granada
Hills--much less to the Granada Hills Pavilion. There's Eli Broad,
the rich and influential Westsider who dreams of a great cultural
center along downtown's Grand Avenue but remains silent on issues
that Valley residents most care about. And there's Mayor James K.
Hahn, cheerleader for a proposed downtown football stadium built with
the assistance of taxpayer redevelopment funds. He should have been
there a few years ago when I spoke to the Studio City Homeowners
Assn. on the Staples Center controversy. The large meeting room was
packed and it crackled with anger at the possibility that taxpayer
funds would be used for the arena. Try the football stadium out on
these people.</TE>
<TE>   But if today's secession movement has many elements in common with
the Jarvis campaign--the populist fervor, the clueless opponents--it
also has some crucial differences that could, in the end, cause its
defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Political and governmental consultant Joel Fox, who became a
Jarvis aide and later headed the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., noted
that Proposition 13 had an easily grasped payoff for voters: It froze
runaway property taxes. "The hard-dollar aspect is the difference,"
he said. "You are not going to have the direct-cost issue" in the
secession fight.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Carrick, a chief strategist for the "no" campaign, agrees
that while the Valley has "real grievances that have to be
recognized," it also has some obstacles to overcome. He believes that
support for secession is "fairly shallow." For example, he said,
participants in focus groups said they supported secession because
they thought it would break up the Los Angeles Unified School
District. Told it would have no impact on the district, Carrick said,
"they turned on a dime" against secession. And, most important, the
vote on secession is citywide, meaning the majority of potential
voters don't share the Valley's emotional commitment to the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 13 was also boosted by some unanticipated last-minute
occurrences. As Robert Kuttner wrote in his book on Proposition 13,
"Revolt of the Haves," the "hard-core faithful gave extremist
initiatives an early lead until the wider electorate appreciated the
fine print, gradually eroding the lead, and a 'crossover' was reached
a few weeks before the election. It began to look as though
Proposition 13 might just follow the pattern. By late April, the 'no'
campaign was within a few points of Jarvis and gaining." Then the new
Los Angeles County property tax assessments came out. The average
assessment would increase 125%, Kuttner recalled. Some would triple.
Finally, in the weeks leading up to the election, the state surplus
was revealed to be $5billion. The anti-13 campaign collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   This time out, there are no property taxes or surpluses to come to
the aid of the secessionists, nothing they can promise that would put
sure money in voters' pockets.</TE>
<TE>   So does secession have a chance? Who knows. We do know that
populism is a powerful and unpredictable force. Oddball politicians
and simplistic solutions have often transfixed Southern California.
Howard Jarvis knew this. Too bad he's not around to enjoy the fight.</TE>

<LD>Minnesota can be considered a veritable mecca for insurgent third
parties. It's governor is maverick independent Jesse Ventura. Its own
Democratic Party is an outgrowth of the Farmer-Labor Party. No
surprise, then, that its Green Party is one of the best organized in
the country.</LD>
<LD>   After winning more than 5% of the state vote in the 2000
presidential election, the Minnesota Greens now qualify for major
ballot status. Taking advantage of the public financing provisions
available as a result, the party could snag as much as $250,000 to
run its gubernatorial candidate this fall. Other Greens will compete
for other statewide offices and for state legislative seats. Already
Greens sit on the Minneapolis and Duluth city councils. For those
seeking alternatives to a two-party system ever more beholden to
special interests, the news coming from the northern plains this
elections cycle could have been welcome.</LD>
<LD>   Could have been. But unfortunately, when hundreds of Minnesota
Greens met for their state nominating convention two weeks ago, they
took a precipitous lunge toward political suicide. By more than a
two-thirds margin, the Minnesota Green Party endorsed a candidate to
run against incumbent Democratic Sen. Paul Wellstone--arguably the
most liberal, themost "Green-ish" member of the U.S. Senate.</LD>
<TE>   Wellstone is already engaged in a touch-and-go fight for his
political survival. The White House is pouring in support for his
conservative rival, Norm Coleman, as the Bushies hunger to retire the
obstreperously liberal Wellstone and to simultaneously win back the
Senate for the GOP. It is an election in which every vote counts, and
even a relatively small Green vote could tip the scales in favor of
Coleman.</TE>
<TE>   A Green running against Wellstone has little in common with Ralph
Nader's presidential run in the 2000 elections. Greens and other
progressives opposed Al Gore because he was too timid on core issues
of social justice. By running Nader in the 2000 elections, the Greens
had a chance to qualify for millions of dollars in public matching
funds, build up their state and local party organizations andinflict
some well-deserved and corrective pain on a national Democratic Party
that continued to drift rightward.</TE>
<TE>   But what's this got to do with Wellstone? The former college
professor is about as liberal as you can get within the Democratic
Party. In the 2000 primary Wellstone also opposed Gore, stumping for
(and often outshining) candidate Bill Bradley. Unlike Gore (but like
the Greens), Wellstone has fought for single-payer health care. He
has opposed his own party on the drug war and intervention in
Colombia. He faced tear gas and rubber bullets as he marched
alongside the Greens against the World Trade Organization's blueprint
for corporate globalization in the 1999 "Battle in Seattle." His
labor record is impeccable. His environmental record is, well, a lush
green.</TE>
<TE>   With all this in mind, the Greens' 2000 vice presidential
candidate, Winona LaDuke, sent an open letter to the Minnesota party
convention passionately urging it not to endorse a candidate against
Wellstone. But LaDuke's plea was pushed aside and her fellow Greens
chose a Native American, writer Ed "Eagle Man" McGaa, to run against
Wellstone.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently Wellstone's unpardonable sin was to have supported the
U.S. military action after Sept. 11 and to have voted, along with 98
other senators, for the USA Patriot Act.</TE>
<TE>   But here comes the really troubling part of this story. Green
candidate McGaa, a veteran of both Korea and Vietnam, says he also
supported a military response to last year's attacks and that he
opposes the Green Party's plank on the war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the Greens--in the name of principle--are risking
the defeat of the greenest member of the Senate by running a
candidate who agrees with Wellstone on what the party evidently
thinks is the make-or-break issue. Talk about not being ready for
prime time.</TE>
<TE>   As a backlash against this silly move builds, the Greens are now
scrambling to explain away the mess. Some say they "had" to endorse
McGaa, otherwise anyone off the street could have paid the filing
fees and wound up on the Green primary ballot--and ultimately running
as the Green candidate in the final election. But McGaa himself, with
little prior visibility among the Greens, seems to have been chosen
on the spot and with virtually no serious scrutiny. Within hours of
his endorsement by the Greens, McGaa made a series of confusing and
intemperate public statements that revealed him to be anything but a
reflective student of political strategy. When asked by the
Progressive magazine if he was concerned about being a spoiler
against Wellstone, McGaa said: "I'm an American Indian. We're not as
analytical as you folks are. We observe and go forth with our
life.... We're less materialistic."</TE>
<TE>   Among those Minnesota Greens who wanted to stay out of the
Wellstone race was Brian Kaller, co-editor of his party's state
newspaper. But even Kaller said McGaa's politically correct
credentials proved irresistible. "McGaa was not familiar to a
majority [of the delegates]," he said. "But there were at least some
people from the Native American community there who ... vouched for
him. And while we are all pro-union, McGaa [was] a union worker. We
are all in favor of peace, but he's a Korean and Vietnam war veteran
who has also spoken out for peace. He is a member of a historically
disenfranchised people. He's a feminist. And an environmentalist."
For many Greens, Kaller said, McGaa is simply a "dream candidate."</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota situation is not, unfortunately, an anomaly in Green
politics. Since their emergence in Germany 30 years ago, the party
has always had a strain of fundamentalists, known as "fundis,"who are
allergic to political compromise and seek a politically pure party,
despite the electoral consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Opposing them have been the "realos," the more pragmatic faction
that argues that politics is the art of building coalitions. The
success of this approach can be seen in the current "red-green"
alliance of Social Democrats and Greens that governs the German
Federal Republic.</TE>
<TE>   In a place like Germany, both factions can easily coexist within
the Greens. In a proportional representation system, where even small
minor parties can win parliamentary seats, a viable argument can be
made to keep the party small but pure.</TE>
<TE>   But how can the "fundi" strategy--as symbolized by the selection
of McGaa to go against Wellstone--sustain itself in the
winner-take-all American electoral system? A Green Party that refuses
to build bridges with allies outside of its own confines is destined
to doom--as so many previous third-party upstarts learned. The
Minnesota Greens should have gone ahead and run their own candidates
for governor and the Legislature and then have joined in the
grass-roots effort to keep their natural ally, Wellstone, in the U.S.
Senate. They would have maintained their own identity and maybe even
have built up the party by winning grateful converts among
pro-Wellstone Democrats. Now, instead, they must campaign for McGaa.</TE>
<TE>   When asked whether he's worried that spoiling Wellstone's
reelection could backfire on the Minnesota Greens and wind up
spoiling their own future, Kaller said: "The short answer is yes.
It's a tough question, one we are going to have to grapple with."</TE>
<TE>   Kaller is only half right. A tough question it is. But it's one
that should have been grappled with thoughtfully and fully before Ed
"Eagle Man" McGaa was flung into the race. The Minnesota Greens had a
good chance to build a model third party. If they don't reverse their
recent action, they will be opting instead for a circus.</TE>

<HD>A Corn-Fed Farm Policy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG CRITSER</AU>
<BD>Greg Critser is the author of "Fat Land," to be
published by Houghton Mifflin in January.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not just the Farm Belt--and its faithful Republican voters--who
were handed a victory with the farm bill that President Bush pushed
through last month. It's also the snack-food industry, the beef
industry and, in all likelihood, the makers of plus-size pants. Their
victory comes via what many consider the quintessential American
crop: corn.</LD>
<LD>   Not since the 1970s, when then-Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz
exhorted the Midwest to plant corn from "fence row to fence row,"
have corn farmers been handed such a plum. It was that policy that
created today's huge corn surpluses, which in turn created today's
very profitable high-fructose corn syrup, or HFCS, industry. Today's
farm-bill subsidies--$190billion for all crops over 10 years--will
give us more of the same: more cheap corn, more HFCS, all
underwritten by urban taxpayers.  But before we celebrate, a
question: Do we really want all that cheap sweetener?</LD>
<TE>   Let's look at what it's done. Coca-Cola and Pepsi were among the
first to see the future. In the 1980s, the companies, wanting out
from under long-standing import tariffs that kept the price of sugar
high, reformulated their drinks, shifting them from 25% HFCS and 75%
cane sugar to 100% HFCS. The cost savings were immediate and
enormous--more than 20%--causing Coke's president of the period,
Roberto Goizueta, to claim the reformulation as one of his principal
executive victories.</TE>
<TE>   The inexpensive sweetener had another effect on the soft-drink
industry as well: bigger servings. As soda became cheaper to
manufacture, its purveyors didn't charge us less: They simply gave us
more. With HFCS, the Big Gulp was both possible and profitable.</TE>
<TE>   If plentiful corn syrup revolutionized the soft-drink industry, so
it also revolutionized the snack-food market, pushing food product
development in the direction of cheap snacks and bakery products. Not
only was the sweetener cheap, but its unique molecular structure, as
its principal manufacturer, the A.E. Staley Co., points out, allows
convenience foods to last longer on the shelf, imbues them with a
tantalizing brown color when baked and confers a "highly desirable
mouth-feel" that regular sugar lacks. It was--and is--a perfect
industrial food.</TE>
<TE>   The number and variety of high-calorie snack foods have
consequently soared. Where all through the 1960s and 1970s the number
of new candy and snack products each year remained stable--at about
250--it jumped to about 1,000 by the mid-1980s and to about 2,000 by
the late 1980s. The rate of new, high-calorie bakery foods also
jumped substantially. A revealing graphic of this trend, charted
against the rise in obesity rates, was published by a group of
nutrition scholars from Tufts University in 1999; the two lines rise
in remarkable tandem.</TE>
<TE>   But the "cornification" of our diet has come with a price. Corn
overproduction has become a major poison in trade politics. Ever
since Mexican authorities complained in 1998 that U.S. firms were
dumping corn syrup there and decimating that nation's indigenous
sugar industry, there has been tension between the two countries over
corn. There is currently a low-level trade war over the issue, with
Mexico having recently slapped a hefty tax on soft drinks sweetened
with anything other than cane sugar, and the U.S. having erected its
own barriers.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, the Europeans have still not forgiven our corn
industry for its widespread use of genetically modified varieties,
one result of which is a de facto boycott of U.S. corn products on
the Continent and the loss of $800million in exports. They are even
angrier about the new subsidies, which just skirt World Trade
Organization limits on price supports.</TE>
<TE>   Still, commodities being the life blood of trade relationships,
one might be inclined to live with such frictions were it not for the
growing scientific concern about the impact of HFCS on our bodies.
Since the mid-1970s, use of the sweetener has soared; it now accounts
for about 9% of the average American's daily caloric intake, with
about one out of 10 Americans--many of them children--getting up to
20% of their daily calories from it.</TE>
<TE>   A big part of the problem, of course, is that sweet things tend to
be filled with empty calories that provide little nutrition. But
scientists are also concerned about properties unique to HFCS. Unlike
sugar, which undergoes an intermediary absorption process in the
small intestine, the fructose in HFCS proceeds directly to the
bloodstream and to the liver, where, an increasing body of evidence
suggests, it may cause potentially harmful metabolic changes. Some
studies have suggested it may increase cholesterol and triglycerides
in the blood and increase the risk of coronary artery disease.</TE>
<TE>   For years, the corn and sweeteners industries have dismissed
concerns, insisting that fructose, which we traditionally got from
fresh fruits, is "the same as all other sweeteners." This defense is
now being questioned by mainstream science. Two years ago, clinical
nutritionist John Bantle at the University of Minnesota at
Minneapolis fed two dozen healthy volunteers a diet that derived 17%
of total calories from fructose--the percentage that Bantle believes
about 27 million Americans eat regularly (particularly all of those
fast-food "heavy users"). Bantle measured the volunteers' blood fats
and sugars and then switched them to a diet sweetened mainly with
glucose. The results were dramatic. The fructose diet produced
significantly higher triglycerides in the blood--in men about 42%
higher--than the glucose-sweetened diet. The fructose diets also made
triglyceride levels peak faster--just after the meal, when such fats
can do the most damage to artery walls. Other studies indict HFCS for
inducing premature aging in skin and suggest it has a role in
skyrocketing rates of irritable bowel syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   Commenting on such findings, researchers in the conservative
American Journal of Clinical Nutrition have noted that "these
deleterious changes [by dietary fructose] occur in the absence of any
beneficial effect ... and these abnormalities ... appear to be
greater in those individuals already at an increased risk for
coronary artery disease."</TE>
<TE>   The point is not that we should stop growing corn--or even stop
making HFCS. The former would be silly and we don't know enough about
the latter yet to make that kind of decision. But we do know enough
from 25 years of corn politics to realize that giant corn subsidies
push us even further down the path of big corn. And while that may
play well with President Bush's swing state voters, it won't play
well with the rest of us.</TE>
<TE>   That isn't to say that most urbanites are outraged by the notion
of industrial agriculture. They aren't. But they do want a farm
policy that balances business concerns with modern nutritional
concerns. If we institute policies that lead to vast increases in
production of a commodity, we have to look at where that product
leads us. Most urbanites are not outraged by the notion of industrial
agriculture. They just want it to be part of a coherent domestic
policy.</TE>
<TE>   They do not want to be brushed aside with remarks like: "What are
you worried about? HFCS is the same as sugar." They want
someone--Department of Agriculture scientists, industry leaders, food
makers--to take up such issues and study them thoroughly. They want
to know whether more HFCS is something truly worth a trade war with a
neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   Or whether it is only worth its weight in trouble.</TE>

<HD>Mr. Businessman Goes to Washington</HD>
<DH>An odd off/on love affair blooms again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NEAL GABLER</AU>
<BD>Neal Gabler, a senior fellow at the Norman Lear Center
at USC Annenberg, is the author of "Life the Movie: How Entertainment
Conquered Reality."</BD>
<DL>AMAGANSETT, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Perhaps not since the 1920s, when the U.S. economy was booming and
the country giddy, have businessmen rushed the political gates the
way they are this election year. In 1924, Democrats, of all people,
nominated John W. Davis, a conservative Wall Street lawyer, for the
presidency. Republicans chose Charles G. Dawes, a banker and
financial advisor, to serve as Calvin Coolidge's vice president.
Faith in business was so strong that, the next year, Bruce Barton's
best-seller "The Man Nobody Knows" was extolling Jesus as the world's
best businessman, able to turn 12 employees into an efficient
organization. The Depression soon dampened pro-business sentiments,
and it wasn't until 1940, when utilities lawyer Wendell Willkie was
the GOP nominee, that businessmen resurfaced as political contenders.
Even then their rehabilitation was short-lived.</LD>
<LD>   But this year, the businessman is back. Candidates with business,
but no electoral, experience are running in one-quarter of the 36
state gubernatorial races, among them Bill Simon Jr. in California
and Winter Olympics organizer Mitt Romney in Massachusetts. Six
sitting governors fit the same description, as do four U.S. senators.
Even that venerable liberal enclave, New York City, has elected a
multimillionaire businessman as its mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg. That
surely proves the hostility is over.</LD>
<TE>   Still, in the wake of the Enron and other business scandals and
the demise of the dot-coms, and with the new focus on international
terrorism requiring some mastery of foreign policy, it seems a bit
strange that politically inexperienced businessmen should be vying
for and occupying pubic office. From the parties' point of view,
there are certainly good reasons to recruit businessmen: They can
finance their own campaigns. Almost as important is that the
"celebritization" of wealth in America has turned businessmen from
objects of vilification into icons of glamour. How else can one
explain billionaire Donald Trump's presidential flirtation in 2000?</TE>
<TE>   But the rise of the businessman-politician has also been the
direct consequence of another permanent feature of our culture that
runs much deeper than electoral logistics. Businessmen are among the
chief beneficiaries of a continuing war against government.</TE>
<TE>   Americans have never much liked government. The Jeffersonian
tradition, our dominant political tradition, is largely built on
suspicion of government authority. Thomas Jefferson has been invoked
both by liberals who fear infringement of their civil rights and by
conservatives who fear infringement of their property rights. It is
only when you need government, as in times of crisis, that the
antagonism subsides. Otherwise, Americans seem to believe that the
government which governs best is that which governs least.</TE>
<TE>   It follows that if Americans distrust government, they also
distrust professional politicians who want to run it. In the early
days of the republic, politicians were drawn from the ranks of
aristocrats who were thought to be concerned only with the public
weal. As the 19th century wore on, the country developed a
professional political class that functioned basically as a service
organization providing for the needs of constituents in return for
votes. But these professional pols were always under siege from
good-government types, and the pols were always at pains to
demonstrate that professionalism in politics was like professionalism
in anything else--a virtue, not a fault.</TE>
<TE>   Over the past 25 years or so of general prosperity and
middle-class complacency, however, anti-government sentiment has
become so powerful that it has overtaken government itself,
especially after the election of Ronald Reagan to the presidency in
1980. As Reagan presented himself, he was a political mole,
undermining the bureaucracy from within by pushing for huge tax cuts
that made it much more difficult to fund government programs. Except
for defense, he essentially promised to dismantle government, and
many Americans seemed happy to acquiesce, subscribing to the words of
Coolidge that "if the federal government should go out of existence,
the common run of people would not detect the difference in the
affairs of their daily life for a considerable length of time."</TE>
<TE>   In selling this idea to the American people, Reagan was not only
playing upon the public's natural antipathy toward government but
upon two myths that continue to frame the debate over government
because they seem self-evident. The first is that government is
hopelessly inefficient, bloated and wasteful and that politicians are
only too happy to spend Americans' hard-earned tax dollars. The
second is that government, which was designed to serve the public
interest, has, over the years, developed interests of its own, and
they diverge from the larger national interest. As far as politicians
are concerned, what this means is that they are seen as having a far
greater investment in their own perpetuation than in the good of the
nation.Since the rise of Reaganism, both these ideas have become part
of conventional wisdom, and that has boosted the prospects of
businessmen-politicians. Government is profligate; business, subject
as it theoretically is to the pure forces of the market, is
efficient, sleek and productive. That is why, adherents say,
businessmen make good leaders of government. They understand how to
manage, how to focus on the bottom line, how to get results. "I've
run a company," businessmen candidates proudly declare in what has
become a political mantra. It is an enormously appealing, if somewhat
fatuous idea: You just run government the way you would run any
company.</TE>
<TE>   Businessmen also seem to be the antidote to the idea that
politicians have only their self-interest at heart. Supporters will
tell you that businessmen haven't been indoctrinated by the political
culture. They don't need to feed at the public trough. They don't see
their interests as identical to the government's. If anything, having
fought federal regulation, businessmen have often been adversaries of
the government. This reputedly makes them purer of heart and truer of
purpose than the run-of-the-mill politician. They are America's great
noblemen.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, if you subject these myths to even the slightest scrutiny,
you realize that neither of them is true. Government can be
tremendously efficient--witness Medicare--and business, as we have
seen recently, can be deceptive, dishonest, profligate and
incompetent, even when you consider that the biggest company in the
U.S. is minuscule next to the government. Similarly, professional
politicians can be public-spirited, even sacrificial, while
businessmen can be selfish and self-serving. When government
interests diverge from the public interest, it is usually because
government is serving the interests of business, as in the Bush
administration's recent decision to impose tariffs on steel imports,
even though that is likely to push up the price of steel products to
consumers. In fact, the real difference between the two major parties
has never been between one that wants more government and one that
wants less but, rather, between one that believes government should
protect the people from business and one that believes government
should protect business from the people.</TE>
<TE>   But true or not, these myths draw on a deep well of
dissatisfaction not only with government but also with the democratic
political process itself, and that dissatisfaction may be the
ultimate appeal of the businessman as politician.
Businessmen-politicians purport to be above politics. They represent
themselves as not having to contend with the messy balancing of wants
and needs, the negotiations among constituents, that is the essence
of politics in a democracy but which has always seemed unwieldy and
tainted. Businessmen don't have to compromise. They command. That was
businessman H. Ross Perot's shtick when he was harassing the major
parties. No political dickering for him. He was just going to go in
there and get things done by fiat. It is one of the most alluring of
political fantasies: that just as President Reagan could use
government to destroy government, the businessman can promise to use
politics to destroy politics.</TE>
<TE>   That is why, even at a time when business itself is being
discredited by one case of malfeasance after another, the businessman
still has political credibility. As much as Americans hate the idea
of business corruption, they hate the idea of government more, and
they hate the idea of politics even more than government. Americans
yearn for a selfless hero who doesn't need politics at all, someone
who arrives, makes decisions without compromise and instantly
achieves results. That is what the businessman entering the political
sphere seems to offer. He tells us that what politics cannot produce,
business can. It is a message many Americans want desperately to
believe.</TE>

<KH>THE DISABLED</KH>
<HD>Supreme Court Upsetting a Rights Movement</HD>
<DH>The Supreme Court's ADA employment rulings read as if they
were drawn from the pages of "Catch-22."</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES LINDNER</AU>
<BD>Charles Lindner is past president of the Los Angeles
Criminal Bar Assn.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During the last 50 years, the U.S. Supreme Court has played a
significant role in three major civil rights movements. In outlawing
school segregation in 1954 (Brown vs. the Board of Education), it
helped ignite the campaign to give African Americans full equality.
In giving women the right to an abortion in 1973 (Roe vs. Wade), it
greatly bolstered the women's movement. And in a series of rulings on
the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), the court seems determined
to reverse the disabled-rights movement.</LD>
<LD>   Because of a fear of "cripples," ignorance or outright bigotry,
the task of gaining mainstream acceptance for the disabled has proved
even more daunting than for blacks and women. For example, a state
refused to hire cancer victims for at least five years after the
patients' last treatments because a government official mistakenly
believed cancer was contagious. A public school refused to hire a
deaf instructor to teach at a state's school for the deaf because she
lacked "listening skills." A zoo turned away children suffering from
Down syndrome because the zookeeper "feared they would upset the
chimpanzees." These were among the more than 100 cases presented to
Congress before it passed the ADA in 1990.</LD>
<TE>   For the disabled, the ADA was the equivalent of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964: It promised to change forever their status in the nation
and open up numerous employment opportunities. The act outlaws state
and private discrimination against the disabled in employment and
mandates that employers treat disabled applicants and employees with
basic human dignity. But unlike the Warren court, which forced a
resistant country onto the path of racial integration, or the
reluctant Berger court that recognized a woman's place in the working
world, the Rehnquist court has stepped off the civil rights path
completely, siding with employers in the first five ADA cases to
reach it.</TE>
<TE>   The current majority apparently isn't shy about distorting the
record to achieve its desired result. In University of Alabama vs.
Garrett last year, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote that
Congress had failed to adequately investigate whether state
governments have a history of discriminating against the disabled. To
anyone familiar with the ADA, this was brazen nonsense. Congressional
committees have investigated disability discrimination for years. The
Garrett dissenters, in fact, published a 39-page list of
state-by-state examples of official acts of discrimination compiled
by a congressional task force.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Rehnquist wrote that it would be "entirely rational
and therefore constitutional for a state employer to conserve scarce
financial resources by hiring employees who are able to use existing
facilities" without the accommodations the ADA requires for those who
need them.</TE>
<TE>   In Sutton vs. United Airlines, the plaintiffs, twin sisters, had
applied for jobs as UAL pilots. They already held jobs as commercial
jet pilots. They had uncorrected vision of 20/200 and corrected
vision of 20/20. United required uncorrected vision of 20/100,
although it did not discharge pilots whose uncorrected vision later
deteriorated, as long as it corrected to 20/20.</TE>
<TE>   The court held that the sisters were not "substantially limited"
in a "major life activity" because there were many other jobs they
could do (just not fly for United). The same reasoning was applied in
Murphy vs. United Parcel Service. In that case, the plaintiff was a
UPS mechanic who was required to drive heavy vehicles as part of his
job. He was terminated because of hypertension, although he
controlled his condition with medication.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, even though the Sutton sisters were not hired because of a
correctable vision deficiency, and Murphy was fired because of his
medicinally corrected blood pressure, the court found that none of
them were disabled for the purpose of employment under the ADA.</TE>
<TE>   Confused? The Supreme Court's ADA employment rulings read as if
they were drawn from the pages of "Catch-22." If you are able to do
the job with glasses or medication, you are not disabled under the
ADA. On the other hand, if you cannot do the job because of your bad
vision or high blood pressure, you are not protected under the ADA.
The only disabled people protected under the ADA are people who do
not need protection.</TE>
<TE>   For the high court, then, some people are not disabled enough;
some people are too disabled; but, so far, nobody has been disabled
"just right."</TE>
<TE>   Ella Williams, an automobile assembly line worker at a Toyota
plant in Kentucky, developed crippling carpal tunnel syndrome on the
job. She was transferred to a job of inspecting paint on cars, but
that job was later expanded to include wiping the cars as they passed
on the assembly line. Toyota fired her when her disability prevented
her from performing the new duties. Williams contended that her
inability to raise her arms above shoulder level was an impairment of
a "major life activity" covered by the ADA.</TE>
<TE>   Writing for the majority, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the ADA
was not meant to cover Williams because she could not do the job.
Once again, the legal precedent appears to have been "Catch-22."</TE>
<TE>   You might think that the obvious remedy for a large corporation is
to find a less physically demanding job for a worker who becomes
disabled.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Barnett, a US Airways employee, injured his back while
working as a cargo handler at the airline. He was reassigned to the
mail room at his doctor's suggestion, but the company later told him
he would have to give up the job to make room for another employee
with more seniority, as required by company policy. Barnett sued.</TE>
<TE>   In late April, the court ruled, 5 to 4, that an employer's
seniority system cannot ordinarily be trumped by a disabled worker
seeking an accommodation under the ADA.</TE>
<TE>   If the court did to the 1964 Civil Rights Act what it has done to
the 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act, blacks would be living
again in pre-1954 America: separate and unequal, undereducated and
underemployed.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, the disabled cannot use "white" restrooms, eat in
"white" restaurants or hold down "white" jobs because the restroom is
unusable, the restaurant inaccessible and the job unobtainable. They
are the last hired and first fired, if they are hired at all. Worst
of all, the U.S. Supreme Court shows no inclination, so far, to right
the scales of "equal justice under the law" for the disabled.</TE>

<HD>The Talk of Small Politics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY RODRIGUEZ</AU>
<BD>Gregory Rodriguez, a contributing editor to Opinion, is
a senior fellow at the New America Foundation.</BD>
<DL>HERMON</DL>
<LD>Angelenos used to be proud of living in the biggest city in America's
biggest state. But Valley secessionists have successfully exploited
our growing tendency to fetishize smallness in matters political.
Small is more manageable. Small is more responsive. Small is simply
more comprehensible. The Valley's secessionist threat led to the
inclusion of neighborhood councils in our new City Charter. More
recently, it has prompted talk of splitting the city into boroughs.
Small is the order of the day.</LD>
<LD>   But small isn't as beautiful as it's cracked up to be. Small can
be petty. Small can be intolerant. In fact, my recent encounter with
smallness made me long for the anonymity and freedom of the big city.</LD>
<LD>   Last Tuesday, in a rare fit of civic activism, I attended a
Department of Neighborhood Empowerment (DONE) commission meeting at
Franklin High School in Highland Park. Full of noble aspirations, I
lured the pastor who lives down the street from me to come along.
Together, we were going to help preserve the identity and autonomy of
Hermon, our roughly 5,000-strong neighborhood in northeast Los
Angeles. We weren't going to stand by and allow big, old Mt.
Washington to swallow us up in their proposed neighborhood council.</LD>
<TE>   So eager was I to say my piece that I arrived at the meeting half
an hour early. But as the night droned on, I became increasingly
disillusioned with neighborhood politics. After 9 o'clock, I sent the
tired pastor home to his wife. I began to pace about. A man
complained about his neighborhood being slighted. Another wanted to
join the council across the ridge. A middle-aged women enumerated all
the communities she didn't want to be a part of. It was identity
politics writ small.</TE>
<TE>   Six hours had elapsed when I finally got my turn to address what
was by then a board of sleepy-eyed commissioners. When I left,
shortly after midnight, I had had my fill of downsized turf battles,
tantrums and infighting. Small is ugly.</TE>
<TE>   A leader from the proposed Arroyo Seco Neighborhood Council
refused to shake hands with the president of the Highland Park group.
Well-organized activists from Mt. Washington made me nervous with
their imperious claims that neighboring Cypress Park belonged to
them. Two angry neighbors accosted me and verbally beat the pulp out
of me for my impudence in addressing the commission.</TE>
<TE>   My friend Don, who understands such things, tells me I'm naive;
that a neighborhood meeting in the home of New England-style
democracy, small New Hampshire, would have been just as nasty. "There
are probably families with undying grudges over someone's grandfather
sapping the other's maple trees," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But I don't believe him. In small New Hampshire, kids grow up
knowing the folkways of local democracy. In small New Hampshire,
people don't make their neighbors' acquaintance at a neighborhood
empowerment meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Three hours into Tuesday's marathon--it ended at 1:30 in the
morning, I later learned--a man did an Al Pacino impression to
denounce the absurdity of the system, and walked out. Today, he is my
hero.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that I'm against neighborhood councils. I just don't
think we realize how foreign small-town culture can be to
hyperindividualist, anarchic L.A. Nor do I think we acknowledge to
ourselves how hard it's going to be to make our city work better or
to get Angelenos to participate. Leaders of the Arroyo Seco
Neighborhood Council, the one that has imperial designs on poor,
little Hermon, boasted about their heroic outreach efforts. But in
their application for official certification from the city, they
reported that an average of "one-half of 1%" of the area's 36,000
residents showed up at their meetings.</TE>
<TE>   As the only big city in the world founded on the promise of the
suburban dream, we still delude ourselves into thinking that we can
magically make our urban reality disappear. Now that we have run out
of open space, there's nowhere else to run. Whether reorganized by
secession, a borough system or neighborhood councils, we're all stuck
with each other. In search of paradise and higher property values,
however, L.A. continues to seek utopia in smallness. Even in my
two-square-mile neighborhood, some folks on the hill decided to give
their piece of land a bit of panache by calling themselves "Mt.
Hermon."</TE>
<TE>   My error, I soon learned, was that I had bypassed the Mt. Hermon
czarina and spoke as an individual resident of Hermon before the
commission.</TE>
<TE>   I asked that my neighborhood, which is identified by blue city
signs and surrounded by natural borders, be excluded from the
proposed Arroyo Seco council. I contended that Hermon does not share
a City Council district, a police division nor common interests with
tonier Mt. Washington, which lies three miles away on the other side
of the Pasadena Freeway. The czarina called me a pompous liar. After
all, she had lived there for 40 years, and I for merely two. What
made me think that my opinion was worth anything? she implied. (For
this I missed the Lakers-Kings game?)</TE>
<TE>   The city attorney and my councilman snickered when I told them
about my comeuppance at the commission meeting. "Now you see how hard
our jobs are," they both proclaimed. And I confess that I have a
newfound appreciation for professional politicians. As Homer Simpson
once said, "The whole reason we have elected officials is so we don't
have to think all the time."</TE>
<TE>   The Riordan administration, which wrote DONE's rules, didn't trust
small-time activists, either, and required that no neighborhood
council represent fewer than 20,000 residents. This standard has had
the effect of encouraging puny, mostly working-class neighborhoods
like mine to align themselves with more solidly middle-class and
influential places like Mt. Washington.</TE>
<TE>   To his credit, Greg Nelson, who now runs DONE, agrees that the
councils would be more effective if they were smaller than 20,000
residents. He encouraged me not to surrender in my fight for
neighborhood self-determination.</TE>
<TE>   I'm going to call up Thomas Bros. to get Hermon on the map. I'm
going to ask the city to stop hosting the Highland Park arts festival
in Hermon's park. I'm going to try my best to keep my neighborhood
out of the czarina's clutches. If all else fails, I'm going to lead a
movement for Hermon to secede from Los Angeles. Small is better.</TE>

<BD>Julia E. Sweig, a senior fellow and deputy director of
the Latin America Program at the Council on Foreign Relations, is the
author of "Inside the Cuban Revolution: Fidel Castro and the Urban
Underground." Michael Marx McCarthy is a research associate at the
council.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Starvation in Guatemala. War in Colombia. Economic collapse in
Argentina. Political paralysis in Peru. Instability in Ecuador, Haiti
and Paraguay. With Latin America vulnerable to upheaval, the Bush
administration's latest hemispheric Achilles' heel, Venezuela, is
ready to blow again. And the consequences would jeopardize the
already precarious democracies in the region and further damage U.S.
credibility.</LD>
<LD>   Since the failed April 11 coup against President Hugo Chavez,
intransigence within and between the opposition and government has
polarized Venezuela. The risk of a second coup, and possibly of a
full-blown civil war, grows daily. While Washington blames Chavez for
the nation's deep divide, his departure from the scene, whether
through constitutional referendum, coup, resignation or
assassination, would only strengthen the Chavista forces.</LD>
<TE>   Chavez is already becoming a living martyr for his unwavering
defense of the poor. In the eyes of approximately 45% of Venezuelans,
Chavez has tried to benefit las clases populares with promises of
spoils from oil revenue. He has begun to distribute resources to poor
communities and, more provocatively, to look the other way as social
networks, "Bolivarian circles," accumulate arms. Though critics note
that his Bolivarian revolution has yet to bear economic fruit, his
supporters are unwilling to relinquish their new powers to the old
guard. Chavismo, with or without Chavez, is now a permanent part of
the Venezuelan political landscape.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-Chavez civilian opposition is an eclectic mix of
Venezuelan society, including labor, business and the media, as well
as new and old political parties. It realizes that its support for
the failed coup produced the passionate, sometimes violent, reaction
of Chavez's supporters. Chavez's subsequent 10-point surge in opinion
polls is evidence that future battles are inevitable. The
opposition's legal strategy is to shave off the president's five-vote
majority in the National Assembly to set the stage for a vote on a
two-stage referendum to end his term before its 2006 expiration.</TE>
<TE>   Of more significance are the near-daily promotions and demotions
in the armed forces, now deeply divided among pro- and anti-Chavez
officers and those eager to stay out of politics altogether. Chavez's
commitment to give up his fatigues and red beret, coupled with the
appointment of Gen. Lucas Romero Rincon as defense minister, the man
who helped briefly end Chavez's rule, in the early morning hours of
April 12, testifies to the military's political muscle. While dozens
of officers are under investigation for complicity in the April coup,
some junior officers have threatened to move against their pro-Chavez
superiors if loyalty to the president, rather than professional
merit, guides the annual promotions slated for next month.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the coalition that drove the coup continue to believe that
removing Chavez, by force or civil war, is the only option. Some even
hope to gain Washington's and the Organization of American States'
support for such a move if a second crisis leads to a bloodbath and
an intolerable humanitarian toll. Mindful of this perverse logic,
veteran Chavista insider Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel recently
described Venezuela's choice as one of "civil war or national
dialogue."</TE>
<TE>   Neither the U.S. nor the OAS has sufficient credibility to help
Venezuela avert a civil war or sponsor a dialogue within it. After
the initial sigh of relief at Chavez's apparent departure, with some
notable exceptions, the OAS, in a special session, condemned the
"alteration of constitutional order in Venezuela" but did not demand
the return of the democratically elected leader. After a fact-finding
mission in Venezuela, Secretary-General Cesar Gaviria noted the grave
polarization in the country, and the OAS passed a resolution calling
for Venezuela to invite outside mediators to participate in a
national dialogue. But Venezuela's foreign minister rejected the
idea, citing sovereignty concerns. As important, he was acutely aware
that the United States and other member states had been all too eager
to accept as fait accompli the ouster of Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration, in also pressing the Venezuelan
government to accept outside mediation, is continuing, for the most
part, to send Chavez's foes the wrong message. Rather than act the
part of the loyal opposition in the government-convened national
dialogue, most anti-Chavistas hope that OAS mediation, or the
government's refusal to accept it, will further isolate Chavez,
hobble his ability to govern and accelerate his departure.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's antipathy toward Chavez may be more ideological than
substantive. Under Chavez, Venezuela has moved forward in ways one
would expect Washington to welcome. He has never directly threatened
cutting off Venezuelan oil, which accounts for about 14% of U.S. oil
imports. He has privatized the state telephone company and devalued
the currency. His government wants to work with the International
Monetary Fund and other multilateral lending institutions and
continues to cooperate on drug-war strategies and other intelligence
matters. And the head of the U.S. Southern Command recently noted
that there is no evidence of Venezuelan support for Colombia's
largest rebel group.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, if Chavez's provocations boil down to ideology and rhetoric,
why do Washington and his neighbors hate him so much?</TE>
<TE>   One reason is that Chavez stirs up class conflict, which causes a
visceral reaction in establishment circles and fear that his appeal
will spread among the poor in the region. Moreover, his in-your-face
style plays right into the Bush administration's preoccupation with
Chavez as the sole reason for Venezuela's current crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Justly or not, the U.S. will take the blame if Chavez falls for
good. With so much of Latin America on the brink of social and
political upheaval, the Bush administration must continue to back off
its policy of diplomatically isolating the Chavez government and to
convince all Venezuelan players to play with the constitutional deck
of cards each has been dealt. Neither the U.S. nor the governments of
Latin America can afford otherwise.</TE>

<LD>Some years back, my bosses tried to reduce common sense to a decree.
The subject was workplace harassment. Their thinking was progressive.
Employees shouldn't have to endure come-ons and put-downs. Naturally,
there was self-protection involved too. The Firm didn't want to be
party to lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   After this policy memo was circulated I assumed that vulnerable
employees felt slightly more secure, having right officially on their
side.</LD>
<LD>   But I also detected a drop-off in what used to be known as
compliments. As in, "That is a lovely outfit." Or, "Blue is
definitely your color."</LD>
<TE>   Here and there, a few people tried to make light of the trend. One
editor and I began calling each other "honey" and "sweetie" by way of
being witty. Generally, though, suspicions were heightened and
distance was widened between those who did not know each other.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it was a more secure workplace, but it was also drearier.</TE>
<TE>   The flaw was not the aim, it was the assumption. It boiled down to
this: Harassment is anything that anyone says it is. That is, if you
feel harassed, you are.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us to this matter of sports teams and their
nicknames, in particular references to Indians such as Chiefs and
Redskins.</TE>
<TE>   Some earnest folks would impose the same standard to athletic
mascots that business has tried to apply to workplace harassment: If
someone or some segment of society is offended, then the nickname is
offensive. You cannot argue the point without displaying
insensitivity to someone's sensitivity. The charge becomes proof of a
crime.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, there are so many things out of whack with organized
sports in our culture that team logos hardly bear concern. But the
power we leverage out of language in the name of social fairness is a
bigger matter--and has been intertwined with team names for some time
now.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest flare-up, the California state Assembly defeated a
bill that would have banned Indian mascots from public schools. But
we all know that we haven't heard the last of it. Once activists bear
down on matters of symbolism, the stakes rise and people start to
feel they cannot lose without losing big.</TE>
<TE>   For the last 40 years or so, we have argued vigorously over the
power of words in our culture, and the damage they inflict and the
stereotypes they preserve. There is no question that oppression has
been diminished and awareness heightened by those who police our
language. Ours is a better society for the way we speak of each other
now.</TE>
<TE>   We are also a society wound very tight on these matters, too
tight, actually. I don't think we'd find ourselves backsliding on
social progress if we agreed that part of enlightenment is the
ability to relax too. We are in danger of draining away not just
bigotry and offensiveness in our language but things worth
celebrating. Whether it is a simple workplace compliment or a
ballpark cheer for our mixed ancestry, maybe we could dare to trust
our good sense now.</TE>
<TE>   So let's gripe about "Redskins."</TE>
<TE>   Here's a word that in any context except football and apples is a
pejorative, always has been. In the United States in the year 2002,
surrendering the word would be a victory for our ideals.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, "Chiefs" has far more going for it than against
it. When I travel the West and interview Native American "chiefs,"
I'm looking up, not down.</TE>
<TE>   To the extent that sports mascots are to suggest strength, unity,
leadership, perhaps even integrity, I can think of few words more apt
than "chief." Surely, it's a metaphor as worthy as "the 49ers," who
were a rag-tag bunch of Gold Rush get-rich-quick schemers.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, "chief" was once a commonplace term used by non- Indians to
describe Indians. When I was in boot camp, all Indians were "chief."
Yet we shouldn't forget that everybody was typecast and slurred as
something. And "chief" carried less stigma than any of the epithets I
recall.</TE>
<TE>   "Words," said the French writer Antoine de Saint-Exupery, "are the
source of misunderstandings." Fortunately, they are also the source
of understanding.</TE>
<TE>   Native American culture is part of our shared national heritage.
Even accounting for all the grudges of history and the contemporary
gaps in justice, there are things we can honor and celebrate, and
sports happens to be an outlet for doing it.</TE>
<TE>   I know--and, boy, do I--that it's possible to offend without
intending so. But I also know it's possible to be offended when you
shouldn't be.</TE>

<HD>Tokofsky's Exemplary Playbook</HD>
<DH>The LAUSD veteran could show other politicians how to
serve Latino voters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD>Frank del Olmo is the associate editor of The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Tokofsky, who since 1995 has represented northeast Los Angeles
on the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education, is
becoming an unwitting trailblazer for other non-Latino politicians in
this increasingly Latino city.</LD>
<LD>   Tokofsky is a refreshing contrast to L.A.'s often slick,
media-driven politicians. After seven years in office, he still
resembles the rumpled social studies teacher he used to be.</LD>
<LD>   And his unlikeness to other pols is only accentuated by his
willingness to be a maverick on some controversial issues the school
board has faced during his tenure.</LD>
<TE>   A few years ago, when a cadre of would-be education reformers was
elected with the support of then-Mayor Richard Riordan, one of its
chief goals was to oust a weak but popular schools superintendent,
Ruben Zacarias. It did, but Tokofsky stood by Zacarias to the end.</TE>
<TE>   When it became clear earlier this year that Latino parents and
community activists had the support to force the resumption of work
on the Belmont Learning Complex near downtown, Tokofsky didn't just
bend to the popular will but stuck by his belief that the site was
still not safe.</TE>
<TE>   -- Last week, he was the lone school board member who defended
standardized tests that California now requires its school districts
to administer. Other board members opted to join other urban school
districts in pushing to have the tests dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Tokofsky's independent streak probably also got him
into the political conundrum he's facing now.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the City Council is scheduled to approve new district
boundaries for the seven school board seats. And no matter how the
lines are drawn, it looks as if Tokofsky will wind up with more new
Latino voters in his district, which already has 51% Latino voter
registration.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of different maps for new districts is under discussion,
but all would push Tokofsky further into the city's Eastside and
adjacent suburbs, like Huntington Park.</TE>
<TE>   Tokofsky is lobbying against the plans, without much success.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not running from Latino voters," he says. "But I'd prefer
Latino voters who know me, in places like Eagle Rock, rather than
voters who don't, in places like South Gate."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the few political activists who care enough to pay
close attention to school board reapportionment have other
priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan and his rich buddies want to protect school board member
Caprice Young, one of the reformers they helped elect.</TE>
<TE>   Young's district adjoins Tokofsky's, as does the San Fernando
Valley district of Julie Korenstein. She is the most reliable school
board vote for the local teachers union, which is helping Korenstein
lobby for a "safe" district.</TE>
<TE>   Latino activists, meanwhile, want at least three school board
districts where Latino voters can wield political influence. They
believe that, given the city's demographics, one of those districts
must be Tokofsky's.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund lawyers say
their goal is not to get more Latinos onto the school board but to
make more elected officials responsive to Latino voters.</TE>
<TE>   The conventional wisdom has it that Tokofsky is politically doomed
the first time he faces a viable Latino opponent.</TE>
<TE>   But, as the old song says, it ain't necessarily so.</TE>
<TE>   Tokofsky has twice beaten Latino opponents, and he could do so
again.</TE>
<TE>   It is almost forgotten now, but all through the 1970s a non-Latino
politician, Arthur K. Snyder, was able to hold a City Council seat
representing the Eastside by paying close attention to his largely
Latino constituents. He not only won regular city elections but beat
back two recall attempts.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, a troubled personal life forced Snyder to leave public
office, but Latinos never voted him out.</TE>
<TE>   Tokofsky is a far better role model than Snyder ever was. He
speaks better Spanish and is not constantly striving for higher
office the way Snyder did.</TE>
<TE>   Tokofsky's example of "not running from Latino voters" might even
help buck up the courage of scared pols like Rep. Howard Berman
(D-Mission Hills), whose new congressional district was so blatantly
gerrymandered to rid him of Latino voters that it led to a
still-unresolved MALDEF lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Berman is a far more polished and experienced politician than
Tokofsky and could retain his congressional seat with ease if he were
willing to put out half the effort Tokofsky does.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's beneath a member of Congress to look to a mere school
board member as a model. But, as noted earlier, Berman could do
worse.</TE>
<TE>   So could the many other local pols--including Tokofsky's fellow
school board members Young and Korenstein--who will inevitably face a
day when a majority of their constituents are Latino.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Should Press India as Well as Pakistan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT G. WIRSING</AU>
<BD>Robert G. Wirsing is a South Asia specialist at the
Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu. The views
expressed here are his own.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>India and Pakistan already have fought three wars with each other.
Now they're hurtling toward another--and potentially horrible--armed
clash. The only undecided issue seems to be whether this conflict is
days, weeks or months ahead.</LD>
<LD>   Yet in the face of this palpable menace, the Bush administration
has been making seemingly endless one-sided appeals that focus on
Pakistan and only compound President Pervez Musharraf's dilemma. This
has forced Musharraf further into a corner from which he can
extricate himself only by belligerent military gestures.</LD>
<LD>   Not surprisingly, the Bush administration's appeals for restraint
have been met not with compliance but with defiance. Witness, for
example, Pakistan's provocative recent testing of the Ghauri and
Ghaznavi ballistic missiles.</LD>
<TE>   What President Bush must do instead is commit the U.S. to a
sustained diplomatic initiative that takes as its core principle the
application of pressure equally to both sides. This means recognizing
that India also is responsible for the escalating crisis. It's not
just Musharraf failing to stop infiltration across the Line of
Control in Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, India has been playing the U.S. like a violin throughout
this crisis. It is getting from Washington the carte blanche it
seeks, which is to advance the agenda in regard to Kashmir that India
has sought for years. The war on terrorism has provided New Delhi
with a bus, and it has clambered on board.</TE>
<TE>   How can it be that the world's sole superpower--the acknowledged
leader of a global counter-terrorist coalition that includes both
India and Pakistan--can't bring enough pressure to bear on them to
head off potential catastrophe? This despite the Bush
administration's remarkable achievement of having developed, in the
space of less than a year, simultaneous and collaborative
government-to-government and military-to-military relationships with
both of these states?</TE>
<TE>   There are three reasons for this frustrating and dangerous
predicament, two of which arise from the subcontinent's own internal
dynamics.</TE>
<TE>   One of these pertains to India. Militarily much mightier than
Pakistan, it is currently ruled by a weak and increasingly unpopular
coalition government. Its public has been outraged by terrorist
atrocities committed on Indian soil by so-called jihadists, who New
Delhi insists are supported and guided by Islamabad.</TE>
<TE>   An enthusiastic supporter of Washington's war on terrorism, New
Delhi is understandably disappointed that the Bush administration has
held back from applying the same standard of terrorist sponsorship to
Pakistan's support of insurgent activity in Kashmir as was applied to
Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. As a result, appeals by right-wing Hindu
nationalists that India should "crush" Pakistan are getting an
increasingly receptive audience in India.</TE>
<TE>   The second reason pertains to Pakistan. Its government, the result
of a 1999 coup, has lost much of the public support it initially
possessed. Now faced with widespread public resentment over the
government's apparent kowtowing to Washington--about whose long-range
intentions in the subcontinent there is massive public
distrust--Islamabad is extremely reluctant to make concessions
demanded by New Delhi as a quid pro quo for India's backing off
militarily.</TE>
<TE>   Most Pakistanis are likely to view any such concessions not only
as an abject surrender to India's months-long campaign of coercive
diplomacy but also as a serious blow to the nation's long-standing
Kashmir cause.</TE>
<TE>   The third reason for the Bush administration's current frustration
is a byproduct of Washington's own policy shortcomings. One major
mistake has been to pin U.S. hopes for preventing the war on the
naive belief that, whether by bullying or the offer to help extricate
Pakistan from its economic straits, Washington could eventually
extract enough concessions from Musharraf to pacify India.</TE>
<TE>   This belief, unfortunately, runs up against the wall of
Musharraf's determination neither to commit political suicide with
his own people nor to jeopardize his nation's long-term interests.</TE>
<TE>   Most mistaken, however, has been the Bush administration's
unwillingness to break loose from Washington's refusal--except in the
extremely unlikely event that both sides demand it--to take an active
role in efforts to reduce tensions and work toward peace in the
region.</TE>
<TE>   What is needed is more evenhanded U.S. pressure on both sides to
come to their senses about the gravity of the situation they now
face.</TE>
<TE>   Call it mediation, facilitation or whatever, there is no
substitute for Washington's engagement in a meaningful peace process
in the subcontinent. Bush's announcement Thursday that he is
dispatching Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld to the region
this week to try to defuse tensions is a first step. It is unlikely
to achieve very much, however, unless followed by a major and
sustained diplomatic undertaking, such as the naming of a special
envoy entrusted with the long-range task of moving India and Pakistan
toward permanent settlement.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, what is needed in Washington at this critical
moment in India-Pakistan relations is a much greater sense of
urgency, a willingness to take bold action and, most important, a
recognition that the conflict cannot be dealt with as a mere subtext
of the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   If the current crisis is not to result in massive and
destabilizing tragedy for the world, the Bush administration must
fully jettison its halfhearted, myopic and one-sided approach. It
should by all means turn up the heat in South Asia--but on both sides
of the border.</TE>

<HD>It's Not About Downtown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The City Council will decide this week whether to split downtown Los
Angeles between two council districts or leave it in one. The people
who live and work downtown overwhelmingly support staying together.
It's hard enough, contends Carol Schatz, president of the Central
City Assn., to nurture a fledgling downtown revival without having to
deal with multiple elected representatives who have competing visions
and agendas.</LD>
<LD>   But this decision is about more than downtown. It's about whether
city government can change--for the better--the way it does business.
What the City Council decides could well influence the other big
decision that this one so eerily resembles.</LD>
<LD>   The downtown core is in the 9th Council District, represented by
the recently elected Jan Perry. That is where an independent
redistricting commission recommended it stay. Councilman Nick Pacheco
disagrees and wants a chunk of it for himself on the thin argument
that much of downtown was in his mainly Eastside 14th District until
the 1970s.</LD>
<TE>   Governments redraw electoral boundaries every 10 years to reflect
population changes recorded in the U.S. census. Too often politicians
use the exercise to jiggle lines in ways that strengthen their power
bases and ensure their reelections. The independent redistricting
commission was born of City Charter reform. The 1999 charter made Los
Angeles' government one of the few to clear the smoke and move the
process from back rooms to open hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than kowtowing to politicians' interests, the commission
emphasized preserving, as much as possible, clusters of neighborhoods
that had recognizable geographic boundaries or shared concerns. Like
downtown.</TE>
<TE>   It is unrealistic to expect that the commission would please
everyone; interests sometimes overlap or conflict with population and
federal voting rights requirements. Especially controversial was its
proposal to pick up a Westside district and drop it into the
fast-growing East Valley. But the 21-member commission made the
city's political map correspond to something other than political
egos, and did it publicly with the public's guidance.</TE>
<TE>   This month, a council subcommittee voted 3 to 2 to ignore its
advice and give Pacheco, if not all he requested, at least an
important part of downtown that would include City Hall, the old
Criminal Courts Building, the California Department of Transportation
building, other Civic Center offices and, we should point out, the
Los Angeles Times building. This is the kind of political deal-making
that charter reform was meant to thwart.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the redistricting commission is advisory. The City Council
can ignore it. That doesn't mean it should. Valley secession
advocates say the only way to fix Los Angeles is to break it apart,
and they have landed a measure that would do so on the November
ballot. Council members have a chance to show voters that it doesn't
take such a drastic step to get government to change.</TE>

<LD>Since I can see no practical difference between a Valley city of well
over 1 million and L.A. as it now exists, I can only speculate that
the people driving this issue intend to make personal gains if the
split is voted in. If it's reasonable for the Valley to pull out of
L.A., then it's equally reasonable for the West Valley to remove
itself from the proposed Valley city.</LD>
<LD>   I suggest that those of us in the more affluent west--bounded by
Mulholland Drive on the south, the mountains on the north and the 405
Freeway on the east--form our own ridiculous, separate city. We can
manufacture more ego-satisfying political jobs and duplication of
municipal services and can assure ourselves of more conflicting
problems with services and transportation than ever before.</LD>

had any difficulty with the Police Department or, God bless them, the
great Fire Department and paramedics who have taken care of me, I'm
sorry to say, too many times. All this propaganda about secession is
a bunch of hogwash that's being fed to us by a group of wealthy
individuals who are egotistical and power-hungry.</TE>
<TE>   What would we, as an independent city, have done on May 24, the
day of the apartment-building explosion and fire in Encino? Would we
be able to muster 40 units of equipment and 200 firefighters in such
quick time? I don't think so. Forget secession and be thankful for
what we have in this city. Be careful what you wish for.</TE>

<LD>Re "Afghanistan Aims to Revive Pipeline Plans," May 30: I wonder if
average Americans understand that oil is the real reason we are in
Afghanistan and that our sons and daughters are fighting for that
cause. Breaking up the Taliban and Al Qaeda was necessary for
stabilization in installing an oil pipeline through Afghanistan to
the oil-rich Caspian Sea Basin. There's so much more to this story,
and I hope newspapers start printing what a lot of us have been
talking about for the last year.</LD>

oil-rich countries, or the countries needed to get oil to market.
They need our marketplace just as much--if not more--as we need their
oil. There is enough oil on the market, with enough variety in
countries that produce oil, that we can always find a supply.</TE>

<LD>Re "Panel Frowns on Efforts to Buy Sudan Slaves' Freedom," May 28:
The Times has circulated old, discredited allegations against the
only program that has liberated black jihad-slaves in Sudan.</LD>
<LD>   The American Anti-Slavery Group has traveled to Sudan to
investigate slavery and slave redemption. We have interviewed
redeemed slaves, Arab slave retrievers, local chiefs and church
leaders. Our investigations, together with those of other independent
researchers, have confirmed that Christian Solidarity International
is indeed liberating slaves whom the United Nations agencies and most
of the human rights community have betrayed for nearly two decades.
CSI merits honor for bringing freedom to so many enslaved women and
children.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Schools Challenge Mandatory Testing," May 29: The worst fault of
the Stanford 9 is the way in which it is used to reward and punish
schools as their scores rise or fall in a grim parody of "The Weakest
Link." Critics of the test would not be charging it with racial bias
if it were being used, instead, to identify schools in most need of
increased financial support, schools whose students need the most
help but receive the least. Put more resources into schools with the
lowest scores, supply students with enough textbooks, attract
qualified teachers through additional incentives and make buildings
as usable as those in affluent neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   Education in the U.S. has not uniformly declined over the past 50
years. My 13-year-old son, in two middle-class public schools, has
been receiving an education far superior to the one I received in the
1940s and 1950s (and mine got me a scholarship to Harvard). He has a
backpack full of textbooks to carry home, fine teachers, interesting
and challenging honors courses. Parents in his elementary school
contributed and raised $80,000 a year for teacher aides, a librarian
and supplies. That school had one of the top Stanford 9 scores in the
LAUSD. If we are going to administer standardized tests, let's change
other laws and procedures so that we use their results fairly and
productively.</LD>

<TE>   Reading your article, I found myself in a rare agreement with Roy
Romer and Delaine Eastin. The issue is not a "racist test" but rather
the racism of the LAUSD board members trying to get rid of testing.
The article says, "School leaders ... argued that standardized tests
perpetuate discrimination against poor and minority children." It is
not the test that perpetuates discrimination but the discriminatory
education provided by those leaders. And now they want to get rid of
objective testing, so the parents and children they discriminate
against will never realize or rebel against the ersatz education they
are getting.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the poorest and most disadvantaged school districts in the
state, like Azusa or Inglewood, show us that poverty and race do not
have to doom children to a sham education.</TE>

<LD>Re "Graduation Speakers Opting for Safe, Unoffensive Topics," May 29:
The trend toward feel-good fluff and away from controversy in
commencement addresses is disturbing but not surprising. The same
trend can be seen on TV, in news magazines and in politics.</LD>
<LD>   Most Americans do not want to be bothered with the burdens of
knowledge and responsibility; we would much rather enjoy our blissful
ignorance and the indulgences of conspicuous consumption, leaving the
problems of the world to supposed experts who periodically regale us
with patriotic rhetoric or lull us to sleep with bland humor and all
forms of pap.</LD>
<LD>   Universities are among the last bastions of true intellectual
discourse; hopefully, the dumbing down begins and ends on graduation
day and does not find its way into the classrooms.</LD>

<LD>Re "Taco Bell Heir Serves Up More Convenient, Easier Way to Vote,"
May 27: In the context of the last election cycle, when some polling
places went unattended, others had staff but no paperwork and the
typical staffer was a distracted part-timer, not a regular county
official, the notion that voter registration should be added to
election day duties is laughable.</LD>
<LD>   There is no way to test, in advance, how many "sudden impulse"
voters this new option might add to the ranks of those who care, but
you can estimate how many millions it will cost to make this into
law. If Rob McKay really wants to help the election process, perhaps
he could use the $10 million or more that he may spend on this
initiative for voter education or even voting equipment.</LD>

<HD>Temporary Loophole Came With Prop. 34</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Huge Campaign Loophole" (editorial, May 29) asked for an explanation
of the Fair Political Practices Commission's ruling that Proposition
34's contribution and expenditure limits do not apply to committees
set up for elections that took place in 2000 and earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Proposition 34 inadvertently created this distinction between old
and new committees. To close this so-called "loophole" by regulation
would have required us to choose an inconsistent reading of one
provision in this complex statutory scheme. We chose instead to abide
by the plain language of the provision--and, at the same time, we
stated loudly and clearly that unlimited money raised through those
old committees cannot be used for current elections. Moreover, we
insisted that the old committees be closed when the officeholders end
their current terms of office.</LD>
<TE>   We made this ruling last summer after four months of heated,
public debate. Our legal staff sent a letter to Assembly Speaker Herb
Wesson's campaign treasurer reiterating what we have said all
along--that the money being raised in old campaign committees cannot
be given to a candidate running for office this year except in the
limited amount ($3,000) provided for by Proposition 34. Like The
Times, we dislike the short-term result. The commission did not want
to see unlimited fund-raising continue in these old committees, and
many officeholders are voluntarily abiding by the Proposition 34
limits now. These are problems of transitioning from the Wild West of
our old campaign finance system into the structures and limits of
Proposition 34. Every state election since Jan. 1, 2001, has been
conducted completely under the Proposition 34 limits.</TE>

<TE>   Re George Skelton's May 30 column on campaign finance: Everyone
keeps focusing on attempts to limit the supply of campaign
contributions and their influence. But let's not forget why the
demand is there--it's because voters respond to the TV ads the
campaign funding buys.</TE>
<TE>   Those concerned by this could focus on getting more objective
information out to the public by other means. The demand for campaign
cash will continue until the publicity it purchases becomes
ineffective. An informed, interested electorate is the best defense.</TE>

say that campaign finance reform is needed to stop the bad
Republicans. Then the Democrats write the measure "unintentionally"
with a loophole. All of the indoctrinated liberal voters pass it.
Then the Democrats are the ones making off with huge donations, and

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Alatorre Looks Forward to End of House Detention" (May 27), I was
shocked to read about L.A. Councilman Nick Pacheco's successful bid
to have former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa's home removed
from his council district. The purpose was to keep Villaraigosa from
running against him in a possible future City Council race. If this
is true, I think it is outrageous.</LD>
<LD>   This power-hungry Pacheco also has been trying to get himself a
piece of Councilwoman Jan Perry's downtown district.</LD>
<LD>   I hope Villaraigosa runs anyway against Pacheco in the near
future. It was Pacheco who helped Mayor James Hahn's campaign with
some dubious political acts last year. Generally, the Latino
community wants Villaraigosa in some public office soon and also
wants Pacheco out of office as soon as possible.</LD>

<HD>Birds Do It</HD>
<DH>If warblers, robins and other models of monogamy are doing
it, must we then conclude that extra-pair copulation--or adultery--is
natural?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLENE ZUK</AU>
<BD>Marlene Zuk is a professor of biology at UC Riverside
and the author of "Sexual Selections: What We Can and Can't Learn
About Sex from Animals."</BD>
<DL>RIVERSIDE</DL>
<LD>In the animal behavior class I teach, students seem interested in one
thing above all others: infidelity. As one student put it recently:
"Last night on TV they said that cheating on your spouse is natural,
because animals do it, so you expect people to do it too. Are we
going to talk about that in class?"</LD>
<LD>   In fact, it is something we talk about in class--although not in
the way it's discussed on late-night television. Since the advent of
DNA-based paternity analysis, scientists have begun intensely
studying infidelity in animals, particularly in birds. It is now
relatively easy to sample the DNA from a set of chicks in a nest and
compare it with the DNA of the male and female associated with the
young. As it turns out, so-called extra-pair paternity is quite
common among birds. The percentage of offspring sired by males other
than the one attending a female and her nest varies widely from
species to species, from 0% in snow geese to a whopping 90% in a
species of brilliantly colored Australian fairy wren.</LD>
<TE>   This discovery was quite a shock to scientists because outwardly
it appeared that most birds were monogamous. Birds have always looked
so admirable, so industrious. The way the male and female rush back
and forth to their demanding brood of chicks seems like nature's
model of good parenting. And now we find that they're actually in the
same situation as millions of modern-day husbands and wives, eyeing a
child warily and making uneasy jokes about the milkman.</TE>
<TE>   My students are no less shocked than the scientists. In fact, they
are horrified. If warblers, robins and other models of monogamy are
doing it, they worry, do we then have to conclude that extra-pair
copulation--or adultery--is natural and expected, part of our
evolutionary heritage and therefore nothing to make a fuss about?</TE>
<TE>   But the truth is, the birds aren't "cheating"; they are just doing
what they do. They don't have rules about the pair bond between a
male and female, and it isn't cheating if there are no rules to
break. If we try to use their behavior as a model or justification
for our own, we might find ourselves making decisions about morals on
very shaky grounds. Because chimpanzees masturbate publicly, does
that mean humans should?</TE>
<TE>   We can make lists of things humans do that animals don't--pay
taxes, watch television, wear socks--or things they do that we
don't--lay eggs, change the color of our skin to match our
surroundings, store sperm in the uterus for years. We are
understandably fascinated with the attributes we share with some
animals, like mate choice, parenting and craving sugar. But trying to
model our behavior on the traits of other species is pointless. It
brings to mind a new version of an old parental admonition: "If all
the lemmings jumped off a bridge, would you jump too?"</TE>
<TE>   In the end, modeling human behavior on animal behavior is absurd
because for each species that exhibits an "admirable" behavior by
human standards, you can probably find one that's "contemptible." And
it's equally silly to be disturbed by what the animals do. Yes, we've
discovered some philandering finches, but real, true,
till-death-do-us-part monogamy is still seen among many animals,
including snow geese and some sea birds.</TE>
<TE>   Still, humans of all ideological stripes seem to feel compelled to
assert that their viewpoints are supported by nature itself.
Traditionalists note that, with few exceptions, males in nature are
physically larger and behaviorally dominant--at least in many
vertebrates--and that females tend to play the dominant role in
nurturing infants. Feminists respond by noting nature's
exceptions--bonobos have lesbian sex, females in most species are the
sex that does the choosing during mating. And of course feminists can
usually end the discussion by bringing up the example of praying
mantids, whose females eat the males after mating.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, though, these arguments are pointless. Humans live in
societies of their own making, and we have shaped society's rules not
so much to conform to nature but in pursuit of the common good.
Murder is illegal because it destabilizes society. So what if
intra-species killing is common in certain parts of the animal
kingdom? I like to think we are perfectly capable of choosing our own
visions of an ideal society without the help of snow geese or wrens.</TE>
<TE>   As a scientist studying animals, not humans, I am also concerned
about how our preconceptions of what constitutes acceptable human
behavior affects our views of animal behavior. Some of the early
papers on extra-pair paternity in birds were positively Victorian in
their assignments of blame. Initially, there seemed to be two
approaches, neither one particularly favorable to females. Either the
males were roaming around taking advantage of hapless females waiting
innocently in their own territories for the breadwinner males to come
home with the worms or else females were brazen hussies, seducing
blameless males who otherwise would not have strayed from the path of
moral righteousness into turpitude. One scientist referred rather
peevishly to "female promiscuity" in blackbirds. Another article,
published in the prestigious journal Nature, dubbed young warblers
fathered by males not paired with the mother "illegitimate," as if
their parents were supposed to have acquired tiny avian marriage
licenses and chirped their vows.</TE>
<TE>   Such prejudices are amusing, but I worry about how they spill over
and influence our interpretation of what we see animals doing. A
paper on Tasmanian native hens, birds with a complex set of
relationships between the sexes, discussed what appears to be
polyandry, multiple males associated with a single female. The paper
refers to this behavior as "wife-sharing." I have never seen the
phenomenon of multiple females associated with a single male labeled
"husband-sharing." Making the males the active parties (they "share"
the female, as if she were a six-pack of beer) may reduce the
likelihood of noticing what the females do, of seeing things from
their point of view.</TE>
<TE>   What, then, is the lesson from so-called infidelity in animals?
The naturalistic fallacy holds that what is natural is good, but what
is natural can't be inherently "good" any more than it can be
inherently amusing, inherently painful or more likely to keep your
hair shiny. That some animals eat their young should no more suggest
an ethic of infanticide than the fact that some animals are yellow
should suggest a fashion trend. And using animal behavior to further
a social agenda--whether by claiming that cheating is justifiable
because it occurs in wrens or by arguing that it is clearly a
debasing act that occurs only in lower organisms--is doomed to fail.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that a male blackbird did not sire some of the chicks in
his nest is fascinating for what it tells us about evolution, about
variation, about what benefits birds in different environmental
circumstances. But it says nothing about appropriate behavior in a
marriage.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I live in a 14-unit apartment building in North Hollywood.
For about 1 1/2 years I was being paid to assist the management with
such things as changing light bulbs and keeping an eye on the laundry
room. They paid me hourly rather than bringing in an on-site manager.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the building has been sold. The new owners released me and
will not bring in an on-site or assistant manager. They have been
completely ignoring my requests to change light bulbs, and several
stairways are dark. I have offered to assist three times but they say
it isn't in the budget. Is it legal not to have an on-site manager?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: It is legal for them not to have an on-site manager at
your building. California Code of Regulations, Title 25, section 42,
requires property owners of apartment buildings with 16 or more units
to have on-site resident managers living on their properties. There
is no such requirement for apartment buildings with less than 16
units.</LD>
<TE>   If the new owners say your services are not in the budget, there
is not much that you can do about it.</TE>
<TE>   The real problem here is the dark stairways. The new owners must
be in the dark about landlord liability if they are knowingly leaving
stairways dark for extended periods of time. If someone slips and
falls, or worse, gets mugged in one of them, the owners are facing
major liability for having knowledge of a potential danger and not
doing anything to correct it.</TE>
<TE>   You might make the new owners aware of their potential liability
and at least persuade them to pay you to change light bulbs for your
safety and theirs.</TE>

<TE>   Use of Security Deposit Isn't Renter's 'Right'</TE>
<TE>   Q: I am moving out of my Los Angeles apartment and need
clarification of my right to use the deposit to pay the last month's
rent. My deposit is equal to the amount of the rent. I want to tell
the landlord to apply the deposit to the last month's rent so that I
do not have to send another rent check and can use that cash toward
the deposit on my next apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Because she would normally deduct cleaning fees from the deposit,
I probably would end up owning her money. If my approach is legal,
could she report something negative on my credit report if I wound up
owing her money and paid her within a couple of days of the receipt
of her bill?</TE>
<TE>   A: You do not necessarily have the "right" to use security deposit
money to pay the last month's rent on your apartment. You may do so
only if the lease or rental agreement authorizes you to do so. As for
your credit report, although the landlord technically could report
you for paying the amount late, it is unlikely she would unless you
wound up owing her money and did not pay in a timely fashion.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Landlord Can't Raise Rent Beyond 3% a Year</TE>
<TE>   Q: I'm an apartment owner in Los Angeles. Seven years ago, I
rented an apartment in a single-family home in L.A. for $450--$50
less than the $500 rent I was getting at the time--to help out an
acquaintance. I never raised the rent, but now I want to raise it to
$475 or back to the original $500.</TE>
<TE>   I know the current rent-control increase allowed is 3% in Los
Angeles. Can I make the rent higher than that rate on the grounds
that I never raised the rent in seven years?</TE>
<TE>   A: No. When you pass up a rent increase under the L.A.
rent-control law for one year, or 20 years, it is gone forever. Also
forbidden under the law is the ability to rent-bank (decrease the
rent from $500 to $450 today and then go back up to the $500 rate
with a 30-day notice at some later time).</TE>
<TE>   You are correct that 3%, or $13.50, is the maximum rent increase
allowed under the law. Therefore, you can increase the rent only up
to $463.50 with a 30-day notice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Swimming Pool Fixes Aren't Mandated by Law</TE>
<TE>   Q: I live in a single-family home in L.A. Does the swimming pool
fall under the warranty of habitability? In other words, is the
landlord responsible for any repair costs to the swimming pool the
same as any other item in the house?</TE>
<TE>   A: Swimming pools are not covered by California's habitability
law. It does cover some waterproofing: "Effective waterproofing and
weather protection of roof and exterior walls, including unbroken
windows and doors."</TE>
<TE>   The habitability law (Civil Code section 1941.1) also covers
plumbing and gas fixtures; heating facilities; electrical; trash,
rubbish, rodents and vermin; and floors, railings and stairways.</TE>
<TE>   You also ask if the landlord is responsible for "any repair costs
to the swimming pool the same as any other item in the house?" If you
believe that the landlord is always responsible for all repair costs,
regardless of the cause of damages, you are misinformed.</TE>
<TE>   The landlord may be responsible for getting habitability and other
problems fixed, but if the cause of damage is negligence or misuse on
the part of a tenant, the tenant is responsible for the repair costs.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I want to try some solar-powered lights for landscaping and
walkways. Do the newer ones provide more hours of light than the old
ones? Are they brighter?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Although most solar-powered kits are not as bright as
low-voltage lights, the newer solar ones provide adequate light for
highlighting plants, marking a path or security. The major advantage
is you just stick them in the ground with no wiring and you can move
them at anytime.</LD>
<LD>   The advances in solar cell and battery technology allow more of
the sun's energy to be converted to electricity and stored in the
batteries until nighttime. At the beginning of summer, when the days
are longest, the new solar-powered lights will stay lighted brightly
throughout the entire night.</LD>
<TE>   Although the size of the solar cells built into the light is
important for charging the batteries daily, don't just compare the
cell sizes when shopping. The newer technologies of solar cells
produce more electricity with smaller size.</TE>
<TE>   There is a variety of lighting styles from various manufacturers
available. Some new decorative models are made of die-cast metal for
durability and styling detail. Several lantern styles can either hang
from a 27-inch riser or mount on a post.</TE>
<TE>   Not only are the solar cells and batteries better, but the newer
designs use more efficient and brighter bulbs. LEDs (light-emitting
diodes) are the most efficient light source, and the bulbs last a
long time. They are available in white or amber light. Amber light
attracts fewer insects.</TE>
<TE>   Fluorescent bulbs are also efficient and brighter than the LEDs.
They are typically about five watts. Halogen bulbs are the brightest
and produce a very white light. They are often used in motion-sensing
lights, which are not on continuously.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Air-Conditioner Tuneup Can Increase Cooling</TE>
<TE>   Q: My house has central air-conditioning, but I also use a window
unit in my bedroom. Neither cools as well as it used to, and my
electric bills were high last summer. How can I maintain and tune
them?</TE>
<TE>   A: Although a central air-conditioner should be professionally
serviced about every three years, there is some annual maintenance
you can do. A springtime checkup should cut an air-conditioner's
operating cost by 10% or more and provide more cooling capacity.</TE>
<TE>   You will find a greater improvement in performance and efficiency
by servicing your window unit. These systems are sensitive to dirty
air filters and debris inside the housing.</TE>
<TE>   The key to keeping your central air-conditioner operating
efficiently and producing its maximum cooling output is to make sure
the air flow through the outdoor coils is not impeded. If the coils
cannot easily transfer heat to the outdoor air, the unit must run
longer and uses more electricity.</TE>
<TE>   First, check the clearance around the outdoor unit. Shrubs can
grow quickly and the foliage can get too close. A 3-foot clearance is
usually adequate. Some outdoor units are side-discharge and others
are top-discharge, so check the clearance in the proper direction.</TE>
<TE>   Switch off the electric power at the indoor breaker box or at the
unit itself. Remove the sheet-metal screws and lift off the housing.
You may find leaves, sticks, toys, etc. in the unit. Clean out the
debris.</TE>
<TE>   If you find coil fins bent over, straighten them as well as you
can with the tip of a sharp knife. Replace the housing, carefully
tighten all the screws, and make sure all the sheet-metal parts fit
tightly. It is important for the fan to draw air through the coils
and not through gaps and cracks.</TE>
<TE>   Planting some shrubs reasonably close to the unit provides shade
and cools the air around the unit. This improves efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Then, go indoors to your air-conditioner blower. Clean or change
the filter because maximum air flow is important there too.</TE>
<TE>   While the filter is out, use your vacuum cleaner brush attachment
to reach cooling coils.</TE>
<TE>   Pop off the front of your window air-conditioner to remove and
clean the cooling air filter. Remove a few sheet-metal screws, and
you should be able to remove the housing. Remove debris and wipe off
the blower and condenser fan blades.</TE>

<HD>Three Sides to Every Kitchen Story? Consider the 'Work
Triangle'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARROL GELLNER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the years, I've learned it's very difficult to design a great
kitchen but fairly easy to design a good one. In fact, a basic
kitchen will just about design itself.</LD>
<LD>   First, big kitchens aren't necessarily better. I've seen plenty of
palatial, 400-square-foot kitchens that are perfectly awful, with
convoluted counter shapes and appliances separated by marathon
stretches. The size of these kitchens serves merely to impress but it
isn't efficient.</LD>
<LD>   Functionally, a well-designed small kitchen can be in every way
equal to a large one, except for the extra storage space.</LD>
<TE>   Regarding appliance locations, the old rule of the "work triangle"
remains useful. If you draw lines connecting the three major work
centers in your kitchen--sink, stove and refrigerator--the sum of the
sides of the resulting triangle should equal at least 13 feet, but
not exceed 22 feet. Ideally, circulation paths should not cross this
triangle, though it's often unavoidable.</TE>
<TE>   There are four basic kitchen arrangements: U-shaped, corridor,
L-shaped and single wall. Your choice is dictated mainly by the
number of doors or other circulation paths that enter the kitchen
space. More openings usually mean less uninterrupted counter space,
though not necessarily a less usable kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Because the U-shaped kitchen is entirely removed from through
traffic, it ensures the maximum continuous counter space and the
least disruption for the cook. One arm of the U can also serve to
divide the kitchen from an adjoining room in place of a solid wall.</TE>
<TE>   Many older kitchens have multiple doors entering the room, which
demands a different arrangement. When the room is long and narrow and
has a door at either end, the corridor (or Pullman) kitchen is the
ticket. It's extremely efficient in narrow confines--hence its use on
railroad cars--and also simple to plan: The sink goes on the outside
wall beneath a window, the range is placed more or less at the center
of the counter opposite and the refrigerator can go at either end.</TE>
<TE>   If the existing room is interrupted by doors entering on two
adjoining walls, an L-shaped kitchen usually fills the bill. In this
case, the sink once again goes on an outside wall under a window, and
the range takes the approximate center of the counter space on the
adjoining side. Depending on space constraints, the refrigerator can
be located at the extreme ends of the L on either wall.</TE>
<TE>   The humble single-wall kitchen, which is most often found in
efficiency apartments, doesn't really have a work triangle because
the work centers are all in a row. As long as there's enough counter
space between the sink, stove and refrigerator, this arrangement will
serve perfectly well.</TE>

<HD>Poor Attic Ventilation Creating Quite the Crackup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MORRIS CAREY and JAMES CAREY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: The drywall in my house separates from the ceiling and
opens a gap of a quarter-inch in the winter. In early spring the gap
closes completely and stays that way until late fall. The drywall
tape comes loose from the wall, and the gap is most significant on
the walls toward the interior of the home.</LD>
<LD>   There is negligible or no separation of the tape along the walls
around the perimeter. The problem is severe on the second floor but
nonexistent on the first floor.</LD>
<LD>   At first I thought it had something to do with settling, as I had
noticed considerable settling of the soil outside. A specialist
inspected my home and told me that the foundation slab was in perfect
condition and settlement was not a factor.</LD>
<TE>   I have had contractors look at the problem and received two
standard responses. One is that the workmanship of the original
builder was poor and the tape used was of poor quality. The other
answer is that this is related to humidity. During the winter the air
inside the house is dry and it causes the wood in the joists to
buckle.</TE>
<TE>   But most contractors are perplexed that this happens only upstairs
and not downstairs. They also seem surprised that the gap is as wide
as a quarter-inch.</TE>
<TE>   Do you know what is going on? More important, do you know how I
can fix it?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: What you describe is a classic case of seasonal expansion
and contraction. The problem stems from excessive dampness, due to
poor attic ventilation or a poorly insulated attic. The moisture
content of the framing members (rafters and ceiling joist) in the
attic above the second floor increases during the damp season and,
thus, they expand.</TE>
<TE>   This expansion causes the roof-ceiling framing to pull away from
the wall framing, resulting in the gap between walls and ceilings.</TE>
<TE>   The problem will disappear when the weather warms and the framing
dries out. The reason that it is occurring on the second floor and
not on the ground floor is because the attic area is subject to
moisture and condensation more readily than the area between floors.</TE>
<TE>   The condition is happening at the interior walls rather than the
perimeter for a couple of reasons: Attic ventilation is usually
better at the perimeter, which would prevent condensation and
expansion. Another possible reason is that interior walls usually are
not insulated. The heat in your home is, therefore, allowed to escape
through the walls into the cool attic. Consequently, condensation
occurs at the ceiling joist, causing expansion.</TE>
<TE>   You can solve the problem by taking the following steps:</TE>
<TE>   * Make sure your attic is well-ventilated. Add eave vents, gable
venting, a ridge vent or turbine ventilator.</TE>
<TE>   * Be certain that household exhaust fans (range top, bathroom and
laundry) do not discharge into the attic.</TE>
<TE>   * Check to make sure that the attic is well insulated--R-38
minimum, and more if you live in a cold climate.</TE>
<TE>   * Control air infiltration by installing gaskets at electrical
outlets and switches.</TE>
<TE>   Keep in mind that you will only minimize expansion by taking these
steps. Some cracking at the wall-to-ceiling connection might
continue. You can further prevent cracking by making sure the ceiling
joists are securely anchored to the top of the wall framing with
nails, screws or L-brackets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Repaint Door, but First Do the Proper Prep Work</TE>
<TE>   Q: I painted my formerly stained front door with gloss exterior
latex, but the paint sticks to the door's rubber weather stripping.
In fact, it pulls the paint off of the door. It also seems like it
never dries. I sanded the door before I painted it until the surface
was dull. What is the solution?</TE>
<TE>   A: It sounds as if the latex paint is not compatible with the
previously stained finish, or the door wasn't properly prepared for
the fresh coat of paint.</TE>
<TE>   For a long-lasting "nonstick" finish, we suggest you start from
scratch. Sand off the gloss exterior latex-paint finish down to the
previously stained surface. Apply a coat of high-quality oil-base
primer and touch-sand it smooth when it dries. Vacuum the dust and
apply two thin coats of high-quality oil-base enamel.</TE>
<TE>   Although you could again use latex paint, we suggest that you use
an oil-base finish. Oil-base paint is more abrasion-resistant, is
easier to keep clean and will cling to your entry door. While we
prefer oil-base paint for interior doors and trim, you can get away
with using latex, provided the surface is properly prepared and you
use high-quality paint. That it is sticking leads us to believe that
the paint might be inferior or was applied too thickly. In either
case, a light sanding and application of a thin coat of finish should
do the trick.</TE>
<TE>   Be certain the door is not closed until the paint has had an
opportunity to fully dry--usually at least a week. This might mean
removing the weather stripping until the paint has dried.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In the wake of a decision by a federal appellate court, home buyers
and refinancers in five states can now have their settlement charges
marked up--padded without limit--by lenders, title companies and
others looking to squeeze more money out of real estate transactions.</LD>
<LD>   Home buyers in Maryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina and
West Virginia recently lost their former federal protections against
undisclosed settlement-cost surcharges on everything from appraisals
to credit reports, courier fees, recordation fees and others. That
means, for example, that a lender or settlement agent in those states
can now charge:</LD>
<LD>   * $350 for an appraisal that was performed electronically at a
cost of a few dollars.</LD>
<TE>   * $65 for a credit file that cost $9.</TE>
<TE>   * $75 for document delivery charges that cost a fraction of that
amount.</TE>
<TE>   * Hundreds of dollars of other, under-the-table add-ons that were
illegal just a few weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   In a stunning rebuke to federal housing officials and the
Department of Justice, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
that a mortgage company that marked up credit report charges to a
consumer violated no federal law.</TE>
<TE>   Absent a successful appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court or
congressional action, the court's decision is now law in the states
covered by the 4th Circuit. A similar situation exists in Illinois,
Wisconsin and Indiana, where an appellate court sanctioned unlimited
settlement-cost markups last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Similar cases are underway around the country, opening up the
possibility of rapid-fire reversals of home buyers' traditional legal
protections as federal district courts cite the two appellate court
decisions as precedents.</TE>
<TE>   The 4th Circuit decision in Boulware vs. Crossland Mortgage Corp.
involved a challenge by a Maryland homeowner to a $65 credit report
fee at settlement. Tyna L. Boulware disputed the fee, alleging that
Crossland Mortgage paid its credit information vendor $15 or less.
The $50 markup was a violation of a long-standing federal
prohibition, Boulware said.</TE>
<TE>   Crossland Mortgage never denied the markup in court. But its
lawyers argued that federal law does not specifically ban surcharges
unless they are split with a third party.</TE>
<TE>   In a terse ruling written by Chief Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III,
the appellate court agreed with that defense, rejecting what it said
was Boulware's contention that federal real estate settlement law is
"a broad price-control statute prohibiting any overcharges for real
estate settlement services."</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer representing Boulware, James E. Felman of Tampa, said
he may request a rehearing of the case, and possibly an appeal to the
U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   For years, the U.S. Department of Housing has prohibited
"upcharges" or markups of settlement-related fees that are not
accompanied by additional services that justify the add-ons.</TE>
<TE>   The Boulware decision came down the same week that a bill was
introduced in Congress to clarify and bolster federal prohibitions
against markups.</TE>
<TE>   That bill, the Mortgage Loan Consumer Protection Act, was authored
by Rep. John J. LaFalce (D-N.Y.), ranking minority member of the
House Financial Services Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal expressly bans "markups of the cost of services
performed or goods provided by another service provider, and fees
charged or collected by one settlement service provider where no,
nominal or duplicative work is done."</TE>
<TE>   It also requires that all fees collected by a lender be disclosed
clearly on the settlement sheet as being collected by the lender.</TE>
<TE>   According to LaFalce, "This provides additional protections
against the practice of disguising markups by rolling them into one
single disclosure item."</TE>
<TE>   Though generally enthusiastic about the Boulware decision, lenders
and title industry experts are worried about LaFalce's bill.</TE>
<TE>   Washington attorney Sheldon Hochberg, who represents title
insurance companies, said the bill could open lenders and others to
new legal attacks on the fairness of their fees.</TE>
<TE>   "No one can be on the side of abusive markups," said Hochberg, but
some fees, such as courier charges and certain title expenses, "are
not known precisely on the date of settlement," forcing settlement
agents to make estimates that may prove high or low.</TE>
<TE>   The upshot for consumers? Whether you live in the eight states
where markups are legal, be aware that the federal protections you
once assumed you had may be evaporating in federal court.</TE>

<LD>Herb Stewart--a classical guitarist who became a book publisher and
then a general contractor--created this house from a small
post-and-beam one built in the '50s.</LD>
<LD>   About this house: Stewart and his wife, Susan Jllien, purchased
the property 16 years ago. The house as it looks today was seven
years in the making. "I had a couple of architects help me initially,
but then I took it from there," he said. "I do all my own work."</LD>
<LD>   Focusing on finishes, he mixed the color of the plaster to
complement the limestone, a golden beige with a hint of grayish
green, and he handpicked all the woods in the house, from the maple
floors to the redwood hallway, 40 feet long and 22 feet high.</LD>
<TE>   He also oversaw design of the limestone pool and its redwood deck.
The irregularly shaped pool has a waterfall that spills into the spa
and overlooks a canyon 100 feet deep.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $3.95 million</TE>
<TE>   Size: Four bedrooms and five bathrooms in 5,800 square feet, on
nearly an acre</TE>
<TE>   Features: The home has walls of glass looking into oak groves, and
a master suite with a terrace and a sitting room. There are also
canyon and greenbelt views.</TE>
<TE>   Where: A gated street in the Beverly Hills area</TE>

<LD>Miguel Ferrer, who plays medical examiner Dr. Garret Macy on the NBC
series "Crossing Jordan," and his actress-wife, Leilani Sarelle, have
settled into a Hollywood Hills home they bought for about $1.7
million.</LD>
<LD>   The couple and their two children were living in New York when
"Crossing Jordan" started airing. But after Ferrer commuted for a
while to L.A., where the series is filmed, they decided to buy.
"Crossing Jordan" was recently picked up for 24 episodes.</LD>
<LD>   The Hollywood Hills home has three bedrooms plus a guest house in
about 5,000 square feet. It was built in 1969 by the late
designer-builder Fred Smathers.</LD>
<TE>   "I saw an ad for the house, one of Fred Smathers' first, and I
went crazy, because I knew him and his work," Ferrer said. "As my
wife and I drove into the driveway, she said she had a feeling that I
belonged there."</TE>
<TE>   Since they bought the home a few months ago, they have been
restoring it with a contractor who knew Smathers. "We ripped out some
fake beams and replaced every doorknob," Ferrer said. Now they're
redoing a bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to get it back to the beautiful Spanish
Mediterranean it was originally. All the brickwork, fixtures around
the pool--like the built-in fountains--the sconces and many of the
chandeliers are still there."</TE>
<TE>   When in New York, Ferrer and his family had been leasing an
apartment on the second floor of a 170-year-old house in Gramercy
Park.</TE>
<TE>   When commuting to L.A., Ferrer stayed in the guest house of his
mother, singer-actress Rosemary Clooney, who has lived in her Beverly
Hills home, he estimated, for 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   After moving from L.A. to New York about four years ago, Ferrer
and his family stayed in Clooney's guest house when visiting L.A. He
remodeled the guest house "from the ground up," he said, "putting in
central heat and air-conditioning." It also has a kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrer, who plays drums with the six-piece rock band the
Jenerators and has written for Marvel Comics, played a drug informant
in the movie "Traffic" (2000) and was a lead in the movie "The
Harvest" (1993), on the set of which he met his wife, who also
appeared in the movie "Basic Instinct" (1992).</TE>
<TE>   The actor, who played a greedy businessman in "Robocop" (1987) and
an FBI forensics expert on the ABC series "Twin Peaks" (1990-91),
plays an unscrupulous land developer in the John Sayles film
"Sunshine State," due out in July.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrer, in his 40s, is the eldest son of Clooney and the late
Oscar-winning actor Jose Ferrer. Actor George Clooney is a cousin.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alex Yemenidjian,  chairman and chief executive of MGM, and his
wife, Arda, have purchased a Beverly Hills-area home on a knoll with
city views for close to its asking price of just under $13 million.</TE>
<TE>   The seller was a European businessman who spent five years
building the French chateau-style home.</TE>
<TE>   The Yemenidjians have interviewed a number of interior designers
to decorate the 22,000-plus-square-foot home on five acres.</TE>
<TE>   The home has a two-story entry with a sweeping staircase; eight
bedrooms overlooking rolling lawns; 12 bathrooms; and a
5,000-square-foot basement.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, there was speculation that MGM would be sold to
a bigger conglomerate, but in April, the MGM CEO signed contract
extensions running through April 2007.</TE>
<TE>   In May, he denied reports that the company was for sale but
expressed a desire to diversify company assets.</TE>
<TE>   The home was listed with Kurt Rappaport of Westside Estate Agency,
Beverly Hills, design sources said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Anna Nicole Smith has leased a $1.3-million home in the Studio
City Hills area for a year with an option to buy.</TE>
<TE>   The house has five bedrooms and 51/2 bathrooms in 4,700 square
feet. It is newly built, on almost half an acre with city views.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the actress-model, now 34, filed court motions in
California and in Texas seeking half of the estate of her late
husband, oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall II, who died at age 90 in
1995. They were married in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   A Texas probate court awarded her $450 million, but Smith's
stepson, E. Pierce Marshall, appealed. In March, Smith was awarded
$88 million by a U.S. District Court judge. Marshall has indicated
that he also would appeal that award.</TE>
<TE>   The 1994 Playmate of the Year appeared in the 1994 movies "Naked
Gun 331/3," "The Final Insult" and "The Hudsucker Proxy." She has
been a model for Guess jeans.</TE>
<TE>   Janice Cohen of Prudential John Aaroe Realtors, Studio City,
represented Smith in her lease option.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Samantha Kluge, the designer daughter of billionaire Metromedia
founder John Kluge, has sold her Beverly Hills-area home and studio
for about $1.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   The heiress, 32, describes the house as her "first modern
project." "I've never designed two things alike," she said. Every two
years, she buys a house, refurbishes it and sells it.</TE>
<TE>   This home has three bedrooms and three bathrooms in 2,300 square
feet. The house was built in 1957 but was completely remodeled and
has new plumbing, air-conditioning, a newly paved motor court and a
gated entry.</TE>
<TE>   There is a guest house and a two-story main house, which has walls
of glass--with city-to-ocean views--and a chef's kitchen with
top-of-the-line appliances. The buyer is a restaurateur.</TE>
<TE>   Kluge will continue to maintain New York and L.A. studios. She
recently bought a condo in an architectural building in West
Hollywood that she will use as a residence/studio.</TE>
<TE>   She founded such companies as SK Designs, for interiors and home
furnishings, and Family Jewels Inc., with such clients as actress
Gwyneth Paltrow.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Ehrlich of Westside Estate Agency had the listing; Jonah
Wilson of Prudential John Aaroe represented the buyer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dianne Bennett, owner of a Beverly Hills-based matchmaking
service, has purchased a Carthay Circle-area home, built in 1922, for
$535,000.</TE>
<TE>   The 3,300-square-foot house, now undergoing a major renovation,
sat empty for more than 40 years. The seller was born in the house
but moved with his family to Palm Springs. The family owned a date
farm in the Coachella Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett, who plans to entertain friends and clients in her new
home, sold her West Hollywood Craftsman-style bungalow, built in
1914, to Chris Olsen, producer and writer of the series "7th Heaven,"
and his wife, Marah Yampolski, a segment producer of "Ripley's
Believe It or Not," for $470,000.</TE>
<TE>   Galina Blackman of Prudential John Aaroe, Beverly Hills,
represented both sides of that deal. Bob Hopkins of Re/Max, Beverly
Hills, represented Bennett in her purchase.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   David Murdock Jr., son of Lake Sherwood developer and Dole Foods
Chief Executive David Murdock, has listed a Bel-Air home, which he
built on spec, at $22 million.</TE>
<TE>   The house has seven bedrooms, 12 bathrooms, a theater, office and
gym in 18,000 square feet. The Mediterranean-style house overlooks
the Bel-Air Country Club and is on a cul-de-sac.</TE>
<TE>   On nearly two acres, the house also has formal gardens, a pool, a
pool house and a large, covered patio.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Hyland and Rick Hilton of Hilton &amp; Hyland, Beverly Hills,
have the listing.</TE>

<DH>From her patio, Esther Williams takes in city-to-ocean
views and dreams up new water adventures</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUTH RYON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Esther Williams got a lucky break in some respects last year when she
fell down a dozen stairs in her Beverly Hills home and shattered her
right ankle.</LD>
<LD>   As she lay injured on a landing, looking up at a painting of
herself in a swimsuit as the star of one of 26 movies she made from
the early '40s to the late '50s, she said, "Well, MGM, you got all
you could out of those legs."</LD>
<LD>   The injury forced her to stay home for months and think, not so
much about her heyday as MGM's "Million Dollar Mermaid," but about
what she wanted to do once she healed.</LD>
<TE>   The answer surprised her. More than 40 years since her last movie,
at a time in life when most people take it easy, Williams has a new
career.</TE>
<TE>   She will work as co-producer with entrepreneur Daniel Flannery of
"Aquaria," a $30-million Las Vegas water spectacle opening in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who will be honored Thursday by the California Design
College as a trendsetter in film fashion, also will work with a
fashion designer to create costumes for "Aquaria."</TE>
<TE>   Williams says she was "a test pilot for swimsuits" when making
movies. Her first starring movie, "Bathing Beauty" in 1944, launched
a genre of film known as aqua musicals. MGM came up with the idea to
compete with the successful 20th Century Fox films featuring ice
skater Sonja Henie.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Williams is enthusiastic about her input on "Aquaria"
swimwear. "It's a different world than you dry people live in. There
are fabrics I can't wait to try."</TE>
<TE>   When she tries them, chances are it will be in her pool, although
she calls it "a skinny-dipping pool, one in which you needn't wear a
stitch."</TE>
<TE>   Designing for "Aquaria," Williams will strive to get a nearly nude
look in a suit for the swimmers, who will portray gods and goddesses
in an adaptation of a Greek myth, which will also feature gymnasts
and ice skaters as characters.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the story will focus on water ballet and synchronized
swimming, which Williams popularized almost as much as stylish
swimsuits and backyard pools. After the war and a few of Williams'
aqua musicals, there was a boom in the building of pools along with
new housing, especially in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' pool in her Beverly Hills home of 28 years is not nearly
the size of the one that was built for her in the '40s by MGM. That
pool, which had a pedestal on a hydraulic lift used to raise the
actress 50 feet out of the water in preparation for a dive, was 90
feet wide, 90 feet long and 25 feet deep.</TE>
<TE>   "My pool is small, because you don't mess with topography," she
said. Her house and pool are on a half-acre knoll.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I still swim," she said. It's a question she is asked so
much that she had business cards made up with that phrase. A daily
swim has been, in fact, part of her physical therapy after her ankle
injury.</TE>
<TE>   Williams bought the house in 1973 with her then-husband, actor
Fernando Lamas. They were married for about 20 years until he died in
1982.</TE>
<TE>   Williams calls Lamas her only leading man who could swim. He was a
swimming champion in Argentina before coming to Hollywood. He once
said to her, "You don't realize that I am one of the five fastest men
in the world." She replied, "I know that, but can you swim?"</TE>
<TE>   The couple had lived together for several years before he
suggested getting married. Williams agreed if Lamas would give up
other women. He agreed if she would give up being Esther Williams,
the star. "Fernando became synonymous with the word 'hiatus,' " she
said.</TE>
<TE>   They lived in Bel-Air before buying in Beverly Hills. "I told
Fernando, in Bel-Air we had an Olympic-sized pool. Now we have an
Olympic-sized view."</TE>
<TE>   The house, which she describes as a villa, focuses on the pool,
the large patio around it and the city-to-ocean view. On a clear day
you can see Catalina Island, Baldwin Hills, Park La Brea and the
Beverly Center.</TE>
<TE>   On the patio are several chaise longues and patio tables with
umbrellas as well as pots filled with geraniums, bougainvillea, roses
and impatiens. The windows are covered with awnings.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a wonderful house," Williams said, "especially
considering that we bought it for $140,000." She figures the home,
built in 1963, is worth $2.5 million today.</TE>
<TE>   When she moved there, actor Rock Hudson lived next door. Later,
Hudson's house was purchased by director John Landis and then
billionaire Paul Allen, who spent nearly three years building a
tennis pavilion and recording studio on the neighboring property.</TE>
<TE>   Williams frowns at the thought of the massive project but is
philosophical. "There was nothing I could do about it."</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who loves to cook dishes that are "good hot or cold like
Chinese noodles," has remodeled her kitchen and turned a dog run into
a 60-foot-long porch.</TE>
<TE>   When adding a porch above the kitchen and laundry room, she
cantilevered the addition because the ground was covered with
decomposed granite. "I had visions of the house sliding down the
hill, so I also had I-beams put under the living room," she
explained.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' house has three bedrooms, three bathrooms and an office
in slightly more than 3,000 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   There is a two-car garage. In it: a 1969 Rolls Royce and a 1970
Mercedes convertible. The cars, both gold, date back to Williams'
days with Lamas.</TE>
<TE>   She has a number of mementos of her movie days: a porthole from
the old MGM pool, through which the cameramen shot; a small, crystal
MGM lion, which all the female MGM stars received; a mammoth memory
book of her movie career filled with clippings and photos collected
by her father, Louis Stanton Williams; and a photo from her first MGM
screen test, taken by the late director George Sidney, who also
directed "Bathing Beauty." It aired in May on Turner Classic Movies,
which has introduced Williams and other MGM stars to a new generation
of film buffs.</TE>
<TE>   The old days at MGM were a time that Williams cherishes. Another
was motherhood. "I like children," said Williams. A painting in her
living room is of her daughter as a child. Another depicts little
girls at the beach. Williams, the youngest of five, grew up in
southwest L.A.</TE>
<TE>   She has three children from a marriage prior to Lamas and three
stepchildren, including actor Lorenzo Lamas. Williams has five
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   She is now married to Edward Bell, a former actor and producer
whom she met in 1984. He was coordinating special events for the
Summer Olympics in L.A. and asked her to be the hostess for a reunion
of the athletes from the 1932 Olympics. In her 1999 autobiography,
"The Million Dollar Mermaid," after the title of one of her MGM
movies, Williams writes that she reminded Bell that she was not an
Olympic champion, but he countered: "You qualified [for the
Olympics]. That's close enough for me."</TE>
<TE>   At age 17, Williams qualified for the 100-meter freestyle in the
1940 Summer Olympics, but due to World War II, the games were
canceled until 1948. By then she was a star at the box office.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, with Bell as her partner, she has been known as a
businesswoman with her Esther Williams Swimsuit Collection and Esther
Williams backyard pools.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with "Aquaria," she is returning to the entertainment world
through a production that makes her think back to her first
experience in show business as Johnny Weismuller's co-star in Billy
Rose's San Francisco Aquacade, which was part of the 1939 San
Francisco World's Fair.</TE>
<TE>   Williams represents what "Aquaria" co-producer Flannery describes
as "the legacy of what we are doing."</TE>
<TE>   He expects to break ground in 60 days on a 2,000-seat theater to
house the extravaganza. The theater, to be built on the Las Vegas
Strip, will have a swimming pool as a stage. Williams will help pick
the headliners from a worldwide competition that will be televised.</TE>
<TE>   "We went to the master," Flannery said. "[Actor] Donald O'Connor
said it best--'There have been actresses, singers and dancers, but
there has been only one Esther Williams who made her kind of movies.'
That genre of entertainment stopped when she did, but she has the
passion and has been waiting for this."</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine me doing this at this stage of life," Williams said. "The
party's supposed to be over."</TE>
<TE>   It's far from over, judging from Williams' ongoing recognition at
such events as the California Design College's evening to benefit the
Actors' Fund and the Mannequins of the Assistance League of Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   In a flier for the college's 11th annual graduation fashion show
and dinner at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, Williams is
lauded as "the goddess of modern American swimwear." Among nearly 20
stars in the college's "Tribute to Hollywood Icons of the Silver
Screen," Williams will be singled out for designing film fashions,
not just wearing them.</TE>
<TE>   "This award is particularly appealing to me," she said, "because I
am being honored for being part of history."</TE>
<TE>   While making "Bathing Beauty," Williams realized that swimsuits
needed to stretch to be attractive, but the only stretchable material
at that time was not available due to World War II. Williams and an
MGM costume designer persuaded a textile firm to incorporate latex
into fabric.</TE>
<TE>   The result was the hot-pink, satin suit that she wore in the
movie. Women across the country soon wanted swimsuits like it, and
the look of swimwear changed dramatically, even in the military.
WAVES (Women Accepted in Volunteer Emergency Services) didn't wear
hot pink, but Williams talked the U.S. Navy into using the more
practical and flattering swimsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The ones issued by the government were like "old sweaters you'd
paint the house in," she said. "It was enough to quit the Navy if you
had to wear one."</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Newly Built, but Not Worry Free" by Diane Wedner, May 12:
Builders need to place themselves in the shoes of their customers.</LD>
<LD>   Homeowners trust builders to provide them with well-constructed
homes. In return, builders receive hundreds of thousands of dollars
from each homeowner.</LD>
<LD>   Why should anyone be surprised when homeowners demand properly
built homes? Their home usually represents the largest and most
important investment they will ever make.</LD>
<TE>   The Aas decision, which prevents homeowners from suing builders to
recover damages to repair building-code violations before a hazard
occurs, is a bad decision. The legislation, sponsored by state Sen.
Martha Escutia (D-Whittier), returns the right to sue and is
necessary because builders are simply not doing their job. Instead of
fighting their customers and dragging out litigation, builders
should, instead, take extra care in making sure projects are built
correctly.</TE>
<TE>   That's how their insurance premiums will decline--not by trying to
manipulate the state Legislature so it is harder for homeowners to
obtain restitution for shoddily built homes.</TE>

<TE>   I have been an expert on many of these [construction defect]
cases. Many of the "claims" on defective electrical work are the
result of people not realizing their obligations. For example, a
favorite claim is that the ground fault circuit interrupter in the
bathroom is defective, yet very seldom do people realize that this
item is supposed to be tested yearly by pressing the test switch.
These units are guaranteed by the manufacturer, but not for a period
of more than a year. They do wear out and must be replaced.</TE>
<TE>   My observation is that, once settled, many of the repairs of these
"life threatening" defects are never performed. In other cases, the
funds are used for deferred maintenance that should have been done as
part of the homeowner's responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   The only folks who gain are the attorneys and the experts, like
me. Everyone else in the equation gets it in the neck, one way or the
other.</TE>

<LD>Film composer--James L. Venable wrote the score for "Iron Monkey" for
its release last year in the United States. He did not write the
music for the movie when it first came out in China in 1993 as was
indicated in Hot Property, May 26. Before the movie was released in
the U.S., it was purchased by Miramax and was re-edited with new
music written by Venable.</LD>

<LD>To see better and save money at the same time, try fluorescent
lighting.</LD>
<LD>   Fluorescent lights now are made to fit right where your old
incandescent lighting is located. Just unscrew the old bulb and screw
in the new one.</LD>
<LD>   Fluorescent bulbs use about 20% less energy and give about 15%
more light. And, although they are about six times more expensive
than the old-fashioned kind, they last about 10 times longer. You'll
have more light--and more evenly distributed light--that is longer
lasting and less costly.</LD>

<HD>The Price Is Right for TV Tapings</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For some Americans, seeing the taping of a favorite TV show is quite
a thrill. Celebrity spotting is almost guaranteed, as is an insider's
peek at all of the technical wizardry that goes into the production
of even the most basic show. Best of all, seeing television live
costs no more than seeing it from the sofa in your living room.</LD>
<LD>   In Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, tickets are free, making
these tapings the least costly activities those big-wallet cities
have to offer.</LD>
<LD>   Distribution methods vary from show to show. For popular talk
shows, such as Oprah, Letterman, "The Tonight Show" and "Live With
Regis and Kelly," apply well in advance by mail, phone or Internet.</LD>
<TE>   For those who just wish to see a show--any show--large ticket
distributors serve as clearinghouses for sitcoms and game shows.</TE>
<TE>   Except for "Friends" and "Judge Judy" (no general admission
tickets have been available since Sept. 11), it's not difficult to
get your laughter and applause immortalized at tapings. For those who
want to get their face on the tube, there are such audience
participation shows as Jerry Springer and Ricki Lake.</TE>
<TE>   If getting on TV is important to you, dress up a bit for the
taping. Just as producers cast guests carefully, they will often put
better-looking audience members within camera range.</TE>
<TE>   Some details you should know: Most sitcoms and some game shows go
on hiatus from late March through late July, meaning there are few of
these types of tapings during this period. With the exception of
"Jeopardy" and "Wheel of Fortune" (which accept audience members as
young as 10), the minimum age for most audiences is 16, sometimes 18.
As tickets do not guarantee admission, smart audience members arrive
at least an hour before the taping.</TE>
<TE>   Following is an abbreviated list of ticket sources:</TE>
<TE>   * Audience Associates, (323) 653-4105, www.tvtix.com: The biggie
in game and talk shows, it often has tickets for "The Tonight Show,"

films (14,000 for "Spider-Man").</TE>
<TE>   * Paramount Studios, (323) 956-1777, www.paramountshowtickets.com:

<LD>A decade ago foliage cruises from New York were an autumn staple for
such sedate and luxurious lines as Royal Viking and Royal Cruise,
both now defunct. But the popularity of these cool-weather sailings
has grown, particularly this year, because many Americans want to
vacation close to home and cruise lines are responding to the demand
by adding more sailings in Canada and New England.</LD>
<LD>   Once known only for Caribbean cruises, Carnival Cruise Line has
expanded to many other areas of the world, including Canada and New
England. After its summer debut in Europe, Carnival Legend, the
line's newest ship, will sail two 11-day cruises, departing New York
on Sept. 22 and Oct. 6. The ship will call in Boston; Portland or Bar
Harbor, Maine (depending on sailing date); and Quebec City, Sydney
and Halifax, Canada. Fares start at $1,299 per person, double
occupancy.</LD>
<LD>   The 2,124-passenger, 88,500-ton ship is the third in a series that
began with the Carnival Spirit's introduction last year. Lavishly
decorated and furnished with every seagoing attraction short of an
ice rink and rock-climbing wall, this ship is for passengers who want
to be amused and entertained day and evening at sea as well as
ashore.</LD>
<TE>   Holland America Line's flagship Rotterdam will offer seven- and
10-day cruises from New York, Boston or Montreal until Oct. 22. Its
seven-day sailings will visit Bar Harbor, and Halifax, Sydney, Prince
Edward Island and Quebec City, Canada. Some 10-day sailings will stop
at St. Pierre and Miquelon, French islands off Newfoundland, Canada,
a rare port of call for cruise ships. The Rotterdam is a classic and
beautiful ship offering the best of traditional cruising; fares begin
at $1,199 per person, double.</TE>
<TE>   Norwegian Cruise Line's Norwegian Dream and Norwegian Sea are
scheduled to sail Canada/New England itineraries from Boston, New
York and Montreal this summer and fall. Despite the similarity of
names, the ships are quite different in size and decor; both are
moderately priced when early booking discounts are factored in. The
1,054-passenger Norwegian Sea is a vintage NCL ship built as the
Seaward in 1988 and extensively refurbished several times since then,
although its cabins are still on the small side. Prices that start at
$749 per person, double, for a seven-day cruise between New York and
Montreal make it a bargain. Ports of call include Quebec City and
Sydney in Canada, Boston and Newport, R.I. Cruises leave Sept. 1 to
Oct. 13 and will be followed by a 14-day Colonial America sailing
from Montreal to Miami on Oct. 20; fares begin at $1,899 with the
early booking discount.</TE>
<TE>   The Norwegian Dream, built as the 1,246-passenger Dreamward in
1992, was "stretched" by being cut in half and having a midsection of
cabins added to increase the passenger count to 1,748. The ship's
design gives it the look and feel of a smaller vessel despite its
size.</TE>
<TE>   With an early booking discount, 10-day round-trip sailings from
Boston start at $1,299 per person, double. Sailings are scheduled
Sept. 25 and Oct. 5 and 15. Ports of call include Sydney, Corner
Brook, Quebec City and Halifax in Canada, and Bar Harbor. Both ships
provide the line's "freestyle cruising," which allows passengers to
dine whenever and wherever they wish without assigned times or
tables.</TE>
<TE>   Princess Cruises also offers a distinctly different pair of ships
on its Canada-New England run, the classic beauty Royal Princess and
the gigantic new Golden Princess. The 1,200-passenger Royal Princess
made its debut in 1984 with what was then a revolutionary concept,
all outside cabins, many of them with private verandas. Today this
ship is still preferred by older couples and singles who have time
for leisurely 10-day cruises and who enjoy the ship's moderate size
and traditional amenities.</TE>
<TE>   Early booking prices start at $2,145 per person, double occupancy;
sailings are scheduled Sept. 17 and 27 and Oct. 7 between New York
and Montreal, visiting Newport, Boston and Bar Harbor, and Quebec
City, Halifax and St. John, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The 2,600-passenger Golden Princess is the sister ship to the
Grand Princess and the new Star Princess, with splashy extras such as
four pools, three dining rooms, three show lounges, a virtual reality
center, a top-deck nightclub, miniature golf course, huge spa and two
alternative restaurants. It appeals more to young cruisers and
families.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Princess has seven-day round-trip sailings from New
York scheduled to depart on Sept. 14 and Oct. 11, and a five-day
sailing on Oct. 19. Ports of call include Halifax, Bar Harbor and
Newport. Calls in Boston and St. John are added on the seven-day
itinerary. Fares start at $935 for the five-day sailing with early
booking discount.</TE>
<TE>   The budget pick of the lot is Regal Cruises' vintage Regal Empress
(built in 1953), a small (by today's standards) and graceful vessel
carrying 914 passengers at modest prices. Brochure fares for fall
foliage sailings begin at $599 for the seven-night round-trip New
England-Canada itinerary that departs Oct. 5 from Baltimore. The same
ports of call--Portland; Bar Harbor; New Bedford, Mass.; and St.
John--are featured on an Oct. 12 round-trip seven-night sailing from
Norfolk, Va. Other summer and fall five-night departures sail round
trip from New York at slightly higher fares.</TE>
<TE>   Although the ship is not as glamorous as the new ones, a peek into
the Empress' lovely library or the etched glass trim in the Mermaid
lounge will take you back to the days of ocean liners. While
upper-end cabins can be spacious, cheaper ones are small, oddly
shaped and sometimes on a you-can't-get-there-from-here deck chopped
up on earlier remodelings.</TE>
<TE>   Award-winning small-ship luxury lines Seabourn and Silversea will
make autumn sailings as well. Seabourn Pride departs Sept. 27 and
Oct. 11 round trip from New York for 14 days, stopping at Boothbay
Harbor, Maine; Halifax, Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Quebec
City and Lunenburg, Canada; and Boston and Newport. Brochure fares
start at $7,999 per person, double, including gratuities, beverages
and air fare.</TE>
<TE>   Silversea's Silver Shadow offers two New England-Canada
itineraries: a New York-to-Montreal sailing Sept. 18, visiting
Newport, Boston, Bar Harbor, Charlottetown, the Gaspe Peninsula and
Quebec City in Canada; and a return from Montreal to New York Sept.
29 with calls in Quebec City, Sydney, Halifax, Boston and Martha's
Vineyard, Mass. Brochure fares begin at $8,695 per person, double,
with gratuities, all beverages, port charges and air fare included.</TE>
<TE>   If you prefer a small, casual vessel, consider cruising the coast
of Maine aboard the little 49-passenger American Eagle from American
Cruise Lines, a comfortable and elegant new U.S.-flag vessel with all
outside cabins and daily ports of call. Every Saturday in August, the
ship sails round trip from Portland along the coast of Maine with
fares beginning at $2,520 per person, double occupancy.</TE>
<TE>   The 100-passenger Nantucket Clipper from Clipper Cruises has
scheduled two Nova Scotia and coastal Maine sailings, a June 1
seven-day sailing from New York to Halifax, and an Aug. 31 itinerary
from Halifax to New York that lasts 14 days. On June 8 and Aug. 17, a
14-day St. Lawrence and Thousand Islands itinerary is offered between
Halifax and Rochester, N.Y. Fares start at $2,030 per person, double,
for the seven-day programs.</TE>
<TE>   Canada's St. Lawrence and Ottawa rivers are the destination for
the 66-passenger Canadian Empress from St. Lawrence Cruise Lines.
Five- and six-night sailings are scheduled this year between mid-May
and late October at fares beginning at $1,171 per person, double
occupancy, including shore tours and nightly entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   American Canadian Caribbean Line's 100-passenger Grande Caribe
cruises the New England islands on five-day itineraries from July 26
through Aug. 16 at fares beginning at $1,145 for a small, lower-deck
cabin with two lower beds but without windows. Attracting mostly
older couples and singles who like to dress casually day and night,
the Grande Caribe also lacks a bar, instead suggesting that
passengers bring their own alcoholic beverages aboard. Islands
visited include Cuttyhunk, Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard off
Massachusetts, and Block Island in Rhode Island. Meals are served
family style at one open seating.</TE>

<HD>Sacramento River History Rolls Along in a New Museum</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Turtle Bay Museum opens this week as the focal point of a 300-acre
park being developed along the Sacramento River in the heart of
Redding in Northern California.</LD>
<LD>   The museum presents the art, history and natural environment of
the region. It includes a 22,000-gallon re-creation of the river with
local fish; a simulated limestone cave with stalactites; a replica
bark-house used by the native Wintu; hands-on exhibits that let
visitors build landforms from sand, among other activities; an art
museum; and a cafe. Opening exhibits include "Journey to Justice" (on
the Wintu, through Oct. 19, 2003) and Ansel Adams photos (through
Oct. 6).</LD>
<LD>   The park was formed by the merger of several local institutions,
including the Redding Museum of Art and History and the Carter House
Natural Science Museum. It already includes a butterfly house, an
arboretum and Paul Bunyan's Forest Camp, with displays on the logging
industry. A futuristic 720-foot-long bridge by Spanish architect
Santiago Calatrava is also planned.</LD>
<TE>   Starting Saturday, entrance to the park, including the museum,
will be $11 adults (up from $4) and $6 ages 4 to 16 (up from $2.50).
The museum is open daily through summer; closed Mondays after Oct. 1.

Oakland on Sept. 6, and, starting Oct. 10, six flights a day to Las
Vegas, a daily flight to Salt Lake City and a fifth daily flight to
New York's JFK airport. The low-fare carrier now flies from Long
Beach to JFK and Dulles airport in suburban Washington. The new
flights went on sale last week.... Internet travel seller
www.expedia.com last week began allowing site visitors to "build"
their own custom trips, choosing flights, hotel, car rental, tours
and attraction tickets to combine into a single package to buy
online.... Visiting London this week? Don't expect it to be business
as usual. The yearlong Golden Jubilee celebration for Queen Elizabeth
II peaks Tuesday, which was declared a national holiday, with a
ceremonial procession to St. Paul's Cathedral followed by a festival.
Some subway stations may be closed and buses rerouted, transit
officials say. For information, visit www.thetube.com.</LD>

<HD>Getting Credit for Flights Booked on Internet Site</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Airline-owned Internet travel seller www.orbitz.com is offering a
credit card that earns points redeemable for airline tickets.</LD>
<LD>   The MasterCard, issued by Juniper Bank, awards two points for
every dollar cardholders charge on Orbitz and one point for every
dollar spent elsewhere. It takes 20,000 points to earn a round-trip
domestic coach ticket worth up to $400. The points are not redeemable
for other products Orbitz sells, such as international travel,
packages, car rentals and hotel stays. Customers sign up on the Web
site.</LD>
<LD>   Although the program may sound similar to airlines' frequent-flier
awards, it can be harder to earn a ticket with Orbitz. To earn one
round-trip ticket you would need to buy 25 round trips if each costs
$400--more if the trips cost less, fewer if they cost more. You would
need a little more than seven Chicago-LAX round trips on American
Airlines, at 3,490 miles each, to reach the 25,000 miles needed for a
free round-trip domestic ticket under that airline's frequent-flier
program.</LD>

<HD>Americans Are Warned to Avoid India, Pakistan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans should not travel to India and Pakistan, the State
Department said May 24. Its warning on India urged travelers
especially to avoid the state of Jammu and Kashmir and all other
areas near the heavily armed border with Pakistan.</LD>
<LD>   It cited "the risk of intensified military hostilities between
India and Pakistan," which have a long-running dispute over the
region that has recently heated up.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first time the State Department warned against travel
to India during the current crisis. Pakistan was already under a
travel warning. The latest one cited tensions with India and also the
March 17 attack on an Islamabad church in which two Americans died
and the kidnapping and slaying of U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl
earlier this year in Karachi.</LD>
<TE>   In other announcements in the last two weeks, the State Department
cited the "potential" for terrorist actions against U.S. citizens in
the Middle East and North Africa and renewed warnings against travel
to Liberia and Macedonia. In Liberia it cited spreading fighting
between the government and rebels. In Macedonia, the department said
the security situation has improved but remains "unsettled."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, it alerted Americans of "possible heightened risks" in
Nepal. The announcement, effective through Sept. 15, cited
anti-American statements by Maoist rebels and reports of robberies of
American trekkers. For more warnings and updates, call (888) 407-4747

<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Somewhere between the 500-pound baby rhinoceros, the 5-foot-tall baby
giraffe and the litter of red river hogs, I became very grateful that
I am a human mommy. Neither my Danny Mac nor my Fiona came into the
world placidly, but at least no hoofs were involved.</LD>
<LD>   My friend Suzann was a bit more sanguine. "Well," she said, gazing
across the Wild Animal Park's African veld at a family of slumbering
rhinos, "if your head weighs 800 pounds, how bad could it be to have
a 500-pound baby?"</LD>
<LD>   Glance at the infant in question--which lacks a horn but otherwise
looks like an adult rhino, only smaller--and you know the answer.
Pretty bad. The gestation periods alone--14 months for a rhino, 12
for a giraffe--do not bear contemplating.</LD>
<TE>   As far as I could see, only the monkeys have it as easy as we do,
and they carry their children around for the first year or so. After
just three days trekking through the wilds of San Diego with
2-year-old Fiona on my hip, I was ready to concede that the greatest
evolutionary development was not the opposable thumb but the
invention of the stroller.</TE>
<TE>   We did not go to San Diego in search of gratitude or lessons in
comparative maternity. My husband, Richard, and I just wanted to get
out of our house, our city and our clamoring heads for a few days in
March. We wanted to spend time with friends and their daughter,
preferably in a place where someone else would make the beds.</TE>
<TE>   Unwilling to face the Friday evening traffic, we left Saturday
morning and drove straight to the zoo, in Balboa Park. Literally a
Hundred Acre Wood (and veld and new rain forest), the San Diego Zoo
has earned a reputation as one of the best on the planet. And with
tickets as much as $32, it ought to be.</TE>
<TE>   The deluxe package we bought ($32 adults, $19.75 children 3 to 11,
free for ages 2 and younger) included tickets for the Skyfari aerial
tram, which aren't necessary unless you have a 4-year-old who wants
to ride "the buckets in the sky" first thing. It also included a
narrated tour on a double-decker bus and access to the zoo's shuttle
bus service, which isn't narrated but is convenient for footsore kids
and arm-weary parents.</TE>
<TE>   It was spring, so we went off in search of babies, and we found
plenty, especially in the Iturri Forest, completed since the last
time we visited. At the Iturri hippo tank, a sign tried to convince
us that a 1-year-old--almost as big as its mother--was still
technically a baby. Little okapi hugged the flanks of their parents,
and those red river piglets were unbelievably adorable. The baby
Schmidt's spot-nosed guenon stole hearts as it climbed up its
mama-monkey's tail and stared at children in the crowd with a
wide-eyed wonderment that mirrored the kids'.</TE>
<TE>   "The rhinos are cool, but I like the babies the best, " Danny Mac
announced as we left the park to meet our friends and to check in at
the Park Manor Suites Hotel, three blocks from the entrance to Balboa
Park. We have stayed there many times and love it so much that my
husband didn't want to mention it in print because, he said, "We'll
never be able to get a room."</TE>
<TE>   The hotel is fabulous. Once an apartment building that was a
summer pied-a-terre for L.A. visitors, it has a wildly baroque lobby
and period charm in every room. (Ours still had its
turn-of-the-century built-in icebox.) The beds and bathrooms, though,
are all modern and, fortunately for those of us with kids, seemingly
indestructible. Most important, almost all rooms have lovely
kitchenettes with a microwave, coffee maker, full-size refrigerator,
dishes and cutlery. A nice continental breakfast, served on the top
floor of the building amid views of the park and San Diego Bay, was
included in our rate, $149 plus tax per night.</TE>
<TE>   Park Manor Suites is also within walking distance of the Hillcrest
district, chock-full of restaurants, cafes and good used bookstores.
We went to City Delicatessen, a diner on University Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   The staff was patient with our rather unruly party. The menu is
huge, and our food ran the gamut--a great cheese-steak sub and
omelets, fine pastrami sandwiches and a vegetarian sandwich that was
a bit greasy and heavy on eggplant. (That's what you get for ordering
vegetarian in a deli.)</TE>
<TE>   The next day we had breakfast and admired the hotel's view before
heading out to Balboa Park, which on a Sunday is kid paradise. We saw
a show at the Marie Hitchcock Puppet Theater and played on the
playground, splashed in fountains and listened to a bagpipe
player--all before lunch.</TE>
<TE>   We ate at Prado, which, according to its sign, is the best new
restaurant in town. This may be true. Our food was great. The shrimp
quesadilla, chicken sandwich and huge chopped salad were all fresh
and sophisticated.</TE>
<TE>   The kids' meals were just as good. For $6, they included a mound
of tasty taro chips, some of the meatiest chicken fingers I have seen
and a colorful reusable plastic cup with a cool bendy straw. (I
personally cannot get enough colorful reusable plastic cups with cool
bendy straws.)</TE>
<TE>   After staring down ducks in the pond outside the arboretum and
watching a street performer make spectacular soap bubbles, we went to
the Natural History Museum's dinosaur exhibit. A movie narrated by
John Goodman relied too heavily on computer animation, but the
exhibit of robotic dinosaurs, complete with babies, was amazing. The
T. rex was frighteningly lifelike, and there was something poignant
about watching the dads, former dino boys themselves, gaze with
wonder.</TE>
<TE>   Then we hit the Reuben H. Fleet Science Center, also in the park.
Except for a fun virtual reality exhibit and a space simulator, the
place was a bit over our kids' heads. Our friend Brian tried to talk
us into the Imax movie "The Human Body," but the mommies were already
excruciatingly familiar with the human digestive system. Brian went
on his own.</TE>
<TE>   We tore ourselves away only when the light began to fade,
returning to Hillcrest for a good dinner at Pizza Nova on Fifth
Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   After breakfast the next morning, we checked out and left for the
San Diego Wild Animal Park in Escondido, about 30 miles north. To get
a sense of the place, we took the narrated tram ride that goes around
the park. We learned that the term for a herd of rhinoceroses is a
"crash"; that giraffes give birth standing up and the babies fall out
on their heads, a drop of almost six feet that prompts them to start
breathing; that looking a gorilla straight in the face is almost
always a bad idea; and that a 2-year-old won't sit still for a
45-minute tram ride even if lions and tigers are involved.</TE>
<TE>   (To my chagrin, I later realized that the $84 couple's membership
in the San Diego Zoological Society, www.sandiegozoo.org, would have
saved us money. As members, two adults get unlimited admission to the
Wild Animal Park and the San Diego Zoo for a year plus two guest
passes.)</TE>
<TE>   Back in the park's central Nairobi Village, we ate lunch. The good
kids' meals included hot dogs, chips, raisins, cookies and another
colorful reusable plastic cup. It all came in a colorful reusable
plastic bucket that kept the kids occupied almost long enough for the
adults to finish eating.</TE>
<TE>   We spent the rest of the day wandering the park, petting the baby
deer and goats, gazing at herds of giraffe, watching the lionesses
stretch and roll over like kitty cats in the sun, marveling at how
far an elephant could stretch its trunk to reach a sweet potato
chucked by an attendant.</TE>
<TE>   We wandered through aviaries and up into treehouses, watched
gorillas watch us (but didn't look them in the face) and peered into
a greenhouse with butterflies as round as hummingbirds. The best
moment came toward the end, when dinner beckoned for many of the
park's denizens. Mesmerized, we watched the water buffaloes and
gazelles, the mountain goats and giraffes turn the California hills
into a shimmering African tapestry.</TE>
<TE>   As we dragged ourselves toward the exit, a group was setting up
for an overnight camp-out in the park. Roar and Snore, the park calls
it. We raced to the ranger station to sign up for the next available
night, only to find that children younger than 8 are not allowed. So
we all made a blood oath that in four years, when Danny Mac is old
enough, we would return with our sleeping bags. Poor Fiona will just
have to hang with Nana and wait another two years.</TE>

<HD>Stirring Views of Coast and Redwoods From Muir Beach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just a half-hour's drive north of the Golden Gate Bridge, Muir Beach
is tucked into an often blustery, foggy cove that escapes the
attention of tour buses making a beeline for nearby Muir Woods
National Monument.</LD>
<LD>   Although you can follow Pacific Coast Highway to Muir Beach, a
more dramatic approach can be made on foot along a spectacular length
of the California Coastal Trail that extends north from Tennessee
Beach. The bluff-top path has lupine-framed, soul-stirring views of
the craggy coast and redwood-cloaked Mt. Tamalpais.</LD>
<LD>   You'll start the hike in the Tennessee Valley, walled in by high
ridges and seemingly isolated from the world, though San Francisco is
only a few miles away. A walk through the valley to the beach is a
fine family adventure and a memorable link to the California Coastal
Trail.</LD>
<TE>   Directions to the trail head: From U.S. 101 north of the Golden
Gate Bridge, take the California 1 offramp. Follow the highway half a
mile, turn left on Tennessee Valley Road and drive to a large parking
lot and the trail head.</TE>
<TE>   The hike: Tennessee Valley Trail begins as a paved road and then
turns to dirt, descending alongside a creek lined with willow and
eucalyptus. A mile out, leave the road and take the left-forking
trail (mountain bikes forbidden), which is a more engaging way to
Tennessee Beach.</TE>
<TE>   About half a mile from the beach, the trail passes a junction with
the California Coastal Trail. Continue on the path through Tennessee
Valley, rejoin the dirt road of the Tennessee Valley Trail and
descend past a small lagoon to the beach. Look for a rock window
above the north end of Tennessee Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Return inland on the same dirt road to a signed junction with the
California Coastal Trail, which you will follow northwest. While
pausing to catch your breath, look behind you to enjoy the views of
Tennessee Valley and the Marin Headlands.</TE>
<TE>   The coastal trail flattens a bit, then descends to Pirates Cove.
The trail marches up and down bluffs and passes a junction with
Coyote Ridge Trail. You'll have a prime panorama of Muir Beach and
Green Gulch as you walk down the steep path toward Muir Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Follow the unsigned sandy trail over low dunes to the beach. Cross
Redwood Creek on a footbridge to reach a parking lot with portable
restrooms.</TE>
<TE>   To return to your starting point, backtrack on the California
Coastal and Tennessee Valley trails. Or, if you have arranged to be
picked up at Muir Beach, drive 11/2 miles north on California 1 to
the Muir Beach Overlook. Follow a cliff-top trail past World War II
gun emplacements to the vista point.</TE>

<HD>National Parks May Not Be as Crowded as Usual</HD>
<DH>Recurrent cancellations and fewer foreign visitors mean
reservations are not impossible this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Our national parks are more crowded than ever. You have to make
arrangements a year in advance to stay at a park lodge. The Internet
is the only way to book because you can't get through by phone.</LD>
<LD>   These popular notions about national parks are questionable, if
not outright mythical, depending on the park. If any of these ideas
is keeping you from visiting a park this summer, this column is for
you. Foreigners, who constitute a fourth or more of summer visitors
at some U.S. national parks, appear to be staying away in droves,
park officials say.</LD>
<LD>   The recession in Japan has long been one cause, and, more
recently, skittishness after the Sept. 11 attacks has driven down the
numbers even more.</LD>
<TE>   At Grand Canyon National Park, which typically depends on
foreigners for nearly half of its visitors, 42% fewer people arrived
at the south entrance station on bus tours through April versus last
year, while arrivals by private vehicles were up 5%, says spokeswoman
Maureen Oltrogge. The net result: 3% fewer park visitors in that
period.</TE>
<TE>   The drop-off in foreign travel is freeing up rooms that wouldn't
have been available in previous years, especially off-rim, says Judi
Lages, vice president of sales and marketing for Xanterra Parks &amp;
Resorts (formerly Amfac), concessionaire for nine national park
sites. When I checked the concessionaire's Internet site,
www.xanterra.com, on May 22, it showed rooms available every night at
the Yavapai Lodge, a quarter-mile from the South Rim, through the end
of the year, except Dec. 1 to 19.</TE>
<TE>   This doesn't mean you can easily reserve a room at the park's
top-of-the-line El Tovar Hotel on the South Rim in the peak summer
season. As of May 22 it was booked every night except two from June
through September, according to the Web site. And forget about
Phantom Ranch in the canyon's bottom. It sells out within hours of
going on sale 23 months out, Lages says.</TE>
<TE>   To take advantage of cancellations for otherwise booked-up lodges,
Lages suggests you call Xanterra, (303) 297-2757, a few days in
advance of when you want to go or 30 days in advance; the latter is
when the lodges release rooms that tour operators can't use. When I
called on a recent Friday, I got through after six minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Summer reservations for Yellowstone National Park lodges are down
8% or 9% from last year, but Bryce and Zion national parks, which
have only one lodge each and depend less on foreign visitors, are
harder to book, Lages says. In a recent check of the Xanterra Web
site, Bryce Canyon Lodge was sold out June through August, except for
one night.</TE>
<TE>   As of May 22, Yosemite National Park still had many rooms with
shared baths available, especially for summer midweek stays, at Curry
Village and the Wawona Hotel, says Linda Stolling, reservations
manager for Yosemite Concession Services.</TE>
<TE>   Not so for the top-drawer Ahwahnee, where all weekend summer dates
but two were booked, a reservations agent told me.</TE>
<TE>   Stolling suggests contacting sold-out lodges seven to 14 days in
advance, when most cancellations occur at Yosemite. You can call the
concessionaire, (559) 252-4848 (I got through after nine minutes on
hold when I called May 22), or book on the Web, www.yosemitepark.com,
a "real-time" site that is updated instantaneously. (You can link to
all the park system's lodge concessionaires through the National Park
Service Web site, www.nps.gov.)</TE>
<TE>   Getting a tent or RV site can be more difficult. As in most
summers, campgrounds tend to get fully booked the day reservations
open, which is five months out, but here, too, cancellations may
occur, Yosemite spokeswoman Deb Schweizer says. Ranger Mike O'Neil
said last month that Grand Canyon campgrounds were not entirely sold
out but that bookings were heavier than average; the park also has 50
first-come, first-served campsites.</TE>
<TE>   You can reserve National Park campsites at reservations.nps.gov,
or at (800) 436-7275 for Yosemite and (800) 365-2267 for more than 20
other parks, including the Grand Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Also in high demand are RV spaces and houseboats at Lake Mead on
the Arizona-Nevada border, California's Shasta Lake and Lake Mohave
near Laughlin, Nev., says Karen Lippe, director of marketing for
Seven Crown Resorts, an Irvine-based concessionaire. By late May the
company had booked 24% more RV spaces and about 5% more houseboats
than the same period last year; many weekends are sold out.</TE>
<TE>   Your toughest ticket this summer may be parks that appeal to
American patriotism. Visits were already up 22% at Gettysburg
National Military Park in Pennsylvania and 33.5% at Mt. Rushmore in
South Dakota through April compared with last year, park officials
report.</TE>
<TE>   By the time this column is printed, however, the picture could
change considerably at the national parks.</TE>
<TE>   The wild card is you. Americans are booking trips later than they
used to, sometimes just two or three weeks ahead, sometimes the same
day, making it difficult to predict how crowded the parks will be,
concessionaires and hoteliers say.</TE>
<TE>   At Thunderbird Lodge at Canyon de Chelly National Monument in
northeastern Arizona, about 90% of guests typically reserve their
rooms in advance, says general manager Mary Jones. And with good
reason: The 73-room hotel, the only one in the park, is in a remote
area nearly 100 miles southeast of Monument Valley and five hours
east of the Grand Canyon, she says. But this year only about half the
guests are booking in advance.</TE>
<TE>   "People just walk in and say, 'Hi. We're here. You got any
rooms?'" Jones says. "We just can't believe it."</TE>
<TE>   So far the lodge has generally, but not always, been able to
accommodate them. (It was sold out for Memorial Day weekend.) As for
the rest of the summer, "I don't even have a clue," Jones says.</TE>

<LD>For their 10th anniversary, Warren Clem decided to surprise his wife,
Carole Ann, with a tropical resort vacation, complete with white sand
beach and frozen drinks garnished with fresh pineapple at the swim-up
pool bar. But romance wasn't on their agenda. The couple didn't even
manage one candlelight dinner.</LD>
<LD>   The Clems spent their week playing in the pool and on the beach
with their 5-year-old son, Graydon, and 4-year-old daughter, Allison,
eating their meals as a family. They weren't interested in using the
resort's morning-till-night children's program to get some time
alone. "We both work," said Carole Ann as the suntanned group
prepared for their flight home to Maryland. "We came on vacation to
be with the kids."</LD>
<LD>   That sentiment is being heard loud and clear at big family resorts
throughout the United States and the Caribbean.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly 40% of travelers say they are likely to take a vacation
with their children, the Yesawich, Pepperdine &amp; Brown/Yankelovich
2002 Leisure Travel Monitor reports. More than one-third of
grandparents who travel have vacationed with grandchildren in the
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Jordan, the senior vice president of marketing for Wyndham
Resorts, says that's why Wyndham's leisure reservations are up 25%
this year. "People want to maximize their time for leisure, to get to
know their families better," Jordan says. "They know how precious
that time is."</TE>
<TE>   Even when they're assigned a personal nanny, as they are at the
Franklyn D. Resort in Jamaica, families keep their babies close.
"They go to the beach together--mom, dad, the kids and the nanny,"
says Freddie DePass, general manager of the Franklyn D. Resort. "If
the baby needs changing, the nanny can do it. She just makes it
easier." Kids stay and eat free at the Franklyn D. Resort; call (888)
FDR-KIDS (337-5437) or visit www.fdrholidays.com.</TE>
<TE>   Some resorts are downplaying their kids' camps and touting family
activities. Wyndham's Jordan, a dad with "overprogrammed kids," has
spearheaded the chain's family retreat program, which offers family
deals and programs such as cooking lessons, parent-child golf clinics
and the chance to watch a movie after dinner while floating in giant
rubber tubes at the Wyndham Rose Hall's water playground, the
centerpiece of the chain's Montego Bay, Jamaica, resort. Programs
vary at each resort and are designed to show off local culture.
All-inclusive rates at Wyndham's Rose Hall start at $345 per room;
call (800) WYNDHAM (996-3426) or visit www.wyndham.com.</TE>
<TE>   If you're vacationing in Hawaii and have $600 to spare, your
family can meet and greet the resident dolphin family at the Hilton
Waikoloa Village as part of the hotel's new Dolphin Families Program.
Call (808) 886-1234 or visit www.hiltonwaikoloavillage.com.</TE>
<TE>   Vacationing in Miami? Join the Family Fitness Camp at Eden Roc
Renaissance Resort, which has kickboxing and family nutrition
sessions. Call (800) 468-3571 or visit www.edenrocresort.com.</TE>
<TE>   Even Hyatt Resorts, which pioneered the kids' club concept, has
jumped on the bandwagon. At the new Tamaya Resort in New Mexico, for
example, there are family yoga classes, or an evening of Native
American storytelling under the stars. Kids can golf for free at many
Hyatt resorts; there are also packages that allow kids to stay and
eat free. Call (800) 55-HYATT (554-9288) or visit www.hyatt.com.</TE>
<TE>   Be forewarned that all of this togetherness may not be very
relaxing--especially for those with young children. Theresa and Marty
DeMonte of New Jersey, who recently spent a week at the Wyndham in
Jamaica with their three kids, were initially disappointed by the
lack of emphasis on the kids' camp activities.</TE>
<TE>   But the disappointment didn't last. "At the end of the day," Marty
says, "what counts is we all had a great time."</TE>

<LD>I hope Peter Hong and his family were occupying first-class seats
when they ate their box lunches of broiled mackerel, black-bean pork
ribs and string beans wrapped in beef teriyaki ("Before Silicon
Valley, There Was San Jose," Weekend Escape, May 19). Even then it
would seem that the other passengers in that section would have to
endure the smell but not the flavor of the box lunches. In coach it
would be unbearable to be seated next to people eating food like
that, not to mention the odor that would cling to their clothing. How
about a little consideration for fellow passengers?</LD>

<TE>   I enjoy Peter Hong's travel articles. I cut out his Berkeley
article ("Berkeley Now--and Then," Weekend Escape, March 3) with the
intent of simulating his trip (especially since it's my husband's and
my alma mater), and now I'm doing the same thing with the San Jose
article. I share Hong's interest in history and was inspired to learn
more--and even try new types of sushi.</TE>

<LD>I have been to Norwich several times, so I read the article about the
city ("An Air of Antiquity in Norwich," May 19) with great interest.</LD>
<LD>   As someone who loves English history and has studied Julian of
Norwich, I disagree with the description of her as a hermit. She was
an anchoress [one who lives apart from society for religious
meditation] who lived in a small room attached to a church. One
window of her room opened to the street, and Julian would have
provided the medieval version of spiritual counseling to anyone who
came to see her. She was hardly a hermit. Also, the church was not
named for her. In all likelihood, she was named for the church.</LD>

<LD>The article "How to Get a Passport" (May 12) stated that an adult
passport is $60 and a passport for children younger than 16 is $40.
These fees include a $15 execution fee, which is payable to the
facility that accepts the application. If your application is
accepted at a courthouse or post office the $15 is payable to that
agency. The fee to Passport Services is then $45 for an adult and $25
for children younger than 16. A separate check or money order would
be needed for the execution fees.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, adults renewing by mail may do so only if they can
submit their most recent unmutilated and undamaged passport, issued
within the last 12 years. The passport must have been issued in the
applicant's current name, and the applicant must have been 16 or
older at the time of issue. Children 16 and younger are not eligible
to renew and must reapply every five years.</LD>

<HD>In Patriotic Times, Rushmore Calls</HD>

<DL>CUSTER STATE PARK, S.D.</DL>
<LD>From the fire tower here, the visages of four American presidents on
Mt. Rushmore, 20 miles north, look about the size of those on nickels
and pennies. A bit to the west, you can see the face of the Sioux
warrior Crazy Horse emerging from another granite cliff, and
7,242-foot Harney Peak, where Native American holy men sought visions
to give them direction. The Black Hills surround the sights, man-made
and natural, like a wagon train circled for the night. Beyond them in
all directions stretch the Great Plains, where buffalo grazed and
battles for America's destiny were waged.</LD>
<LD>   After that, there's just sky.</LD>
<LD>   Some places are better than history books for telling our stories.
The Black Hills of South Dakota, out of the way and undiscovered by
the trendy set, would be such a place even if an obsessed Danish
American sculptor hadn't carved the faces of George Washington,
Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln on the
southeast-facing flank of Mt. Rushmore.</LD>
<TE>   Appropriately, perhaps, it takes a little effort to get to the
Black Hills. Unless you drive to South Dakota, you have to fly to
Rapid City, a town of about 61,000 that doesn't seem to have a
building taller than 10 stories except for grain elevators. Its
motels and attractions--petting zoos, go-cart tracks and the
like--look as though they haven't changed since the '50s, reassuring
to those of us who recall bygone family vacations in old-fashioned
touristy places like this. When you scan a restaurant menu, you can
expect plenty of meat, including venison and buffalo, served by
people who seem so genuine that you start to wonder if they're
putting you on.</TE>
<TE>   For all those reasons, the next time a foreigner asks me what to
see in the U.S., I'll say L.A.; New York; Concord, Mass.; the Grand
Canyon--and South Dakota's Black Hills.</TE>
<TE>   I thought I would never be able to look at Mt. Rushmore without
Alfred Hitchcock sitting on my shoulder, reminding me of how Cary
Grant and Eva Marie Saint dangle from the noses and cheeks of the
presidents during the climax of the 1959 thriller "North by
Northwest." I thought there was something vaguely kitschy about the
massive sculpture. How could anyone improve on the sheer granite
cliffs of the Black Hills, shot through with quartz and glinting with
mica?</TE>
<TE>   I was wrong on all counts. Visitors are bound to be impressed, no
matter how they come upon Mt. Rushmore--whether on the grand
ceremonial approach provided by U.S. Highway 16A from the ticky-tacky
tourist town of Keystone; or from behind, where a hairpin bend in
South Dakota Highway 244 presents a surprise profile of George
Washington; or from the south on dauntlessly switchbacking Iron
Mountain Road, which has tunnels that perfectly frame the cliff
carving in the distance.</TE>
<TE>   Close up, Mt. Rushmore National Memorial grounds don't look quite
as they did in the Hitchcock movie, thanks to a $56-million
renovation completed in 1998. A paved walkway lined with the flags of
the 56 U.S. states, districts, territories and commonwealths takes
visitors from the parking garage toward the monument, passing a
cafeteria and large gift store along the way. The walkway ends at a
broad stone terrace directly overlooking an amphitheater where
nightly presentations are held, ending with the illumination of the
monument by high-powered quartz and halogen lamps. Beyond it are
ponderosa pines, 450,000 tons of rock blasted off the cliff during
construction and now tumbled against the mountain's lower flank and,
finally, the four presidents' faces.</TE>
<TE>   They are silver in bright sunlight, at other times dappled by the
shadows of clouds or all but obscured when the Black Hills are
shrouded with fog. The visages are 60 feet high, eyes 11 feet wide,
noses 20 feet tall, created on 5,724-foot Mt. Rushmore in about 14
years, ending in 1941, by 400 workmen, sculptor Gutzon Borglum and
his son Lincoln.</TE>
<TE>   The four were meant to represent the founding, growth and
preservation of the United States. Washington, to the left, is the
most prominent; Jefferson is to his right as you face them, though he
was moved there only when a fault was discovered in the rock on
Washington's other side, where the Jefferson carving was started.
Next comes Theodore Roosevelt. He was a friend of sculptor Borglum,
who included the 26th president despite critics who said T.R. didn't
belong in such august company. Bookending the monument on the far
right is a bearded Abraham Lincoln, a shoo-in, though Borglum
deliberated about whether to sculpt the author of the Gettysburg
Address with facial hair.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors spend their time snapping pictures or simply gazing at
the monument from the terrace. Some venture down to the visitor
center, dug into the hill that faces Mt. Rushmore. It has exhibits on
the ways Borglum met the technical challenges of carving the
monument, on its place in American popular culture (the famous
mountain appears on mugs, license plates, key chains and even "Sesame
Street") and on how the National Park Service maintains the sculpture
by filling newly discovered fissures with silicone sealant.</TE>
<TE>   I walked the three-fifths-mile circular trail that winds through
the forest past Borglum's high-ceilinged studio, which has his
plaster model of the sculpture and one of the jackhammers used to
carve it. The path yields to a series of steps and decks that take
you to the lower edge of the talus slope below the monument, so close
to the presidents that it seemed as though I could tickle them under
their chins.</TE>
<TE>   As I made my way back to the visitor center, I rested on a bench,
where I heard someone above me launch into a creditable rendition of
"God Bless America." She showed up on the deck where I was sitting a
few minutes later, unembarrassed to admit she had been too inspired
to stop herself from breaking into song.</TE>
<TE>   The most easterly upthrust of the Rocky Mountains, the Black Hills
are an oval dome of billion-year-old granite that covers the
southwestern corner of South Dakota like an island in the prairie.
This place was sacred to the Sioux, the most powerful tribe in the
West when white explorers and trappers arrived. George Armstrong
Custer, already an experienced Indian-fighter when he led an
expedition into the area in 1874, reported that the hills were full
of gold "from the grass roots down."</TE>
<TE>   These days, one of the things that makes the hill country precious
is 73,000-acre Custer State Park, about 20 miles south of Keystone,
which I liked even more than Mt. Rushmore. It was founded in 1919 by
U.S. Sen. Peter Norbeck of South Dakota, who also helped lay out Iron
Mountain Road, which twists and turns to the park's eastern entrance,
and the Needles Highway, another scenic byway in the park that loops
around the bases of huge granite spires like yarn around a knitter's
fingers.</TE>
<TE>   Along these roads and the park's 18-mile wildlife drive, visitors
encounter buffalo, deer, pronghorn antelope, elk, bighorn sheep,
burros and wild turkeys but no bears, which were eradicated from the
area around the turn of the last century.</TE>
<TE>   Even without the bears, Custer State Park is a little Yellowstone,
over which conservationist Teddy Roosevelt can look from Mt. Rushmore
with contentment.</TE>
<TE>   I entered the park on Iron Mountain Road, where I saw my first
bison of the trip ambling across the pavement in front of me, and
scars on the hillsides left by the fire of 1988, which was started by
lightning and burned nearly 17,000 acres. I was headed for the State
Game Lodge on U.S. Highway 16A, one of four rustic resorts inside the
park, with hotel rooms and cabins, restaurants, grocery stores and
swimming, boating, horseback riding, hayrides and four-wheel-drive
tours.</TE>
<TE>   The State Game Lodge was the summer White House of President
Calvin Coolidge in 1927. (Silent Cal slept in a four-poster bed,
which is still in a guest room on the second floor, and did some
fishing, unaware that the creek and pond nearby had been stocked with
trout to ensure his success.) The lodge is a grand old stone and wood
building set in a meadow, with rockers on a wide front porch, modern
motel wings on either side and umbrella tables on the lawn below,
beside which a bison was bedding down just as I drove up. I got a
room with a sleigh bed across the hall from Cal's.</TE>
<TE>   I was dismayed to learn that the restaurant wasn't serving dinner
the night I arrived. Taking pity on me, the front desk clerk poured
me a glass of white wine from the bar and took me to the walk-in
refrigerator in the kitchen, where I loaded up on cheese and
crackers. That's the way of things at the park lodges, not
perfect--the Cornish game hen comes to the table pink; rooms are
cold, at least in early May, when I visited; and you have to be
careful not to step in a buffalo pie when you walk across the parking
lot. But all is forgotten because staff members try so hard to right
the wrongs.</TE>
<TE>   From the State Game Lodge I took a buffalo safari in a 10-year-old
Jeep Wagoneer driven by Kathy Funk, who spends the summers
introducing tourists to bison in the park and the rest of the year
operating a tow truck. We took the wildlife loop south from the lodge
and saw pronghorn antelope right away, but the buffalo herds, with
spring calves, kept eluding us. Kathy drove off-road in search of
them, to hilltop aeries pierced by the song of the meadowlark and
canyons where 19th century homesteaders tried to settle. But it
wasn't until we turned back toward the lodge that we ran into a
little herd of mothers with babies, their coats still orange.</TE>
<TE>   Later I drove west to Legion Lake Lodge to visit the cabin of
South Dakota cowboy poet Badger Clark, who lived from 1883 to 1957.
He wrote such memorable lines as "Who kin envy kings and czars/When
the coyotes down in the valley/Are a-singin' to the stars."</TE>
<TE>   Then I climbed the fire tower atop 6,023-foot Mt. Coolidge, built
in 1941 by the Civilian Conservation Corps. There the unpredictable
path of past forest fires is apparent, taking one tree but not its
neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   About five miles west, I saw the stockade built in 1874 by a party
of gold hunters who sneaked into the region Custer surveyed, despite
the 1868 Treaty of Ft. Laramie, which had given the Plains Indians
sole custody of the Black Hills. As miners started flooding in, the
government couldn't enforce the treaty. The result was battles
between the U.S. Cavalry and Indian warriors like Sitting Bull and
Crazy Horse at the Rosebud and Little Bighorn rivers, where Custer
died and the Sioux star blazed briefly.</TE>
<TE>   Crazy Horse was killed in 1877 by a soldier at Ft. Robinson in
Nebraska. The buffalo, on which his people subsisted, were near
extinction. By the time Sitting Bull submitted to life on a
reservation in 1881, the fight had gone out of the Plains Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Near the stockade in the town of Custer, I stopped at Ken's
Minerals, where I found a 12-pound block of Black Hills rose quartz I
bought to use as a doorstop. Then I drove about 20 miles farther west
on U.S. Highway 16 to tour Jewel Cave National Monument, which has
pristine formations of calcite crystals, 127.1 miles of passageway
charted thus far, and a huge room I didn't get to see called the "Big
Duh."</TE>
<TE>   Back in the state park, I had dinner at Blue Bell Lodge, just
south of the watchtower: trout caught in nearby French Creek,
accompanied by the ubiquitous baked potato and side salad.</TE>
<TE>   After three nights at the State Game Lodge, I moved to Sylvan Lake
Resort, another Custer State Park hostelry set above a man-made lake
surrounded by granite pinnacles. Frank Lloyd Wright suggested the
setting but didn't actually design the building. It's still a beauty,
especially the bar, where stuffed bighorn sheep and elk look down on
guests.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of staying in the lodge, I took one of the resort cabins
built of log and stone high above Sylvan Lake. It had two double
beds, durable carpeting, curtained windows and a rock fireplace. On
my first day there, I followed the trail to Harney Peak, thinking of
Sioux shamans on their vision quests. It rained the next day, so I
stayed in my cabin, reading and feeding the fire.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 miles west of Mt. Rushmore, another monumental cliff
carving is taking shape. It will depict the Sioux warrior Crazy Horse
and is the work of sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski, who died in 1982
after carefully planning the monument but seeing little of it done.
His wife, Ruth, and 10 children have continued on. Now a private
foundation manages the monument, and a crew of eight workmen labors
over it, including two Ziolkowskis. At the rate things are going,
some say it could take 50 more years to finish.</TE>
<TE>   Sioux Chief Henry Standing Bear wrote to Ziolkowski in 1939,
asking the sculptor to give the Black Hills a carving of a Native
American hero to go along with those of the presidents. When
Ziolkowski arrived, he had to start a dairy farm to finance work on
the sculpture, which began in 1948 with the first of what would be
many dynamite blasts.</TE>
<TE>   I arrived at the Crazy Horse Memorial, just east of U.S. Highway
385, in the late afternoon, in time to tour the museum, which has an
excellent collection of Native American art, vintage photos of Sioux
leaders and memorabilia like a saddle used at the 1876 Battle of the
Little Bighorn. Then I took the last bus trip of the day to the base
of 6,740-foot Thunderhead Mountain, where the face of Crazy Horse,
871/2 feet from chin to forehead, was completed in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   It's like something out of a vision quest, altogether stirring,
partly because visitors get to see the blasting and carving, and
partly because the sculpture is so dynamic, judging from the model in
the museum. No one knows exactly what Crazy Horse looked like because
he spent his life avoiding white men and their cameras. But already
the sculpture does him credit. When finished, it will show him on an
Indian pony riding south, his hair flowing behind him, arm
outstretched, index finger pointing south, toward the heart of the
beautiful and eloquent Black Hills.</TE>

<TE>   Getting there: From LAX, connecting service (change of planes) to
Rapid City, S.D., the closest airport to this area, is available on
Delta, United and Northwest. Restricted round-trip fares begin at
$222.</TE>
<TE>   Most major car rental companies are represented at the Rapid City
Regional Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Where to stay: There are motels and cabin compounds in Keystone,
Custer and Hill City. But my favorite places to stay in the Mt.
Rushmore area are the four lodges in Custer State Park. The State
Game Lodge &amp; Resort is near the east entrance to the park. It has 21
cabins, two motel wings and seven rooms in the historic main
building; rates for lodge or motel doubles $75-$225, cabins $80-$350.</TE>
<TE>   Legion Lake Resort has 25 cabins beside a lake, a general store
and a deli-style restaurant; $85-$135.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Bell Lodge &amp; Resort is in the ponderosa pines south of Legion
Lake and has 29 cabins around a log lodge, where there's a restaurant
and bar; $99-$175.</TE>
<TE>   Sylvan Lake Resort overlooks the granite needles that surround
Sylvan Lake in the park's northwestern sector. It has hotel rooms and
rustic cabins; lodge doubles $75-$225, cabins $80-$300 (for a
16-person cabin).</TE>

<DL>LAIRG, Scotland</DL>
<LD>I was driving alone north out of Lairg in the Scottish Highlands,
thankful it was daylight and the sun was shining. At 1 p.m., I still
had time to grab a late lunch (if I was lucky enough to find
someplace that served food in this remote landscape), get to my
destination and return to the cottage my husband, Don, and I had
rented.</LD>
<LD>   At night or in a typical howling Highlands storm, I would have
been terrified on this lonely one-lane road about 30 miles from the
north coast of Scotland. But in bright sunshine the exquisite
tapestry of textures and colors was eye candy. This is Britain's
answer to Big Sky country.</LD>
<LD>   In the distance clouds framed dark shadows of craggy mountains on
the west coast. The nearby landscape was gold, purple and brown,
thick with peat bogs, grasses and heather that parted gurgling
streams, staining their rocky paths a rusty orange. Small blue lakes
appeared now and then, and trees, when they appeared at all, were in
clusters. The effect was of a huge expanse that never ended, an
exhilarating and wildly beautiful space that left me feeling as if I
were one of the last people on Earth.</LD>
<TE>   The Highlands, one of Europe's last great wildernesses, covers the
northern part of Scotland, an area of about 20,000 square miles,
roughly two-thirds the size of Maine. Don and I had hoped to visit
the northern Highlands years earlier on a loosely planned trip, but
an early snow in late August spooked us, and we turned west to the
coast instead.</TE>
<TE>   For this trip, hoping to experience the wilderness without
sacrificing comfort, I leafed through a book of rental cottages I had
picked up in an Edinburgh bookstore on a previous visit. The
Gatehouse at Strathkyle Lodge sounded appealing--it was far away from
cities and set in beautiful scenery. I phoned the owners, Gus and
Tricia Head, to see if the place was still open, and after a lengthy
conversation I booked a week in September. My plan was to see as much
as possible on Scotland's far northeastern coast, particularly the
ruins left by the country's Bronze Age inhabitants from about 100 BC.
This coast doesn't have the rugged landscapes and steep coves that
the west coast does, but it is beautiful in a gentler way, with
approachable beaches and sandy coves.</TE>
<TE>   Several days before my drive, my husband and I had taken the train
from Edinburgh to Inverness, the capital of the Highlands, where we
picked up a rental car. Behind the railroad station was a large
supermarket. We loaded up the car with enough groceries for a week.</TE>
<TE>   The two-hour drive from Inverness to Ardgay was easy, taking us to
an impressive viewpoint overlooking Dornoch Firth, a long inlet from
the North Sea, past farm fields, moors and the 19th century
Carbisdale Castle (now a youth hostel), and finally through winding,
wooded hills overlooking the Kyle of Sutherland, a river-like body of
water that narrows from Dornoch Firth.</TE>
<TE>   The cottage was about 10 miles west of Ardgay (pronounced
ard-GUY), a village with two small markets, a cafe, post office and
gas station. Our home for the week was the reconstructed gatehouse of
Strathkyle Lodge, a Victorian hunting lodge built by the Earl of
Elgin in the 19th century. The estate comprises more than 4,000
acres, 200 of them wooded. Our hosts lived in the lodge; large but
not pretentious, it was built of white-painted stone with black trim.</TE>
<TE>   Rooms in the front of the lodge looked across a beautiful private
lake, Strathkyle Loch, toward the mountains of the west coast, with
forest on either side. Pine martens, wildcats, otters, deer and many
bird species inhabit the forest. This is superb walking and hiking
country.</TE>
<TE>   Our cottage, built of native stone, had been restored to a
miniature replica of a typical rustic Highlands hunting lodge. To one
side of a center hall was a cozy winter sitting room with comfortable
furniture and a fireplace; behind it was the kitchen. Across the hall
was a paneled dining room, a summer sitting room, a half bath and, at
the rear, a utility/mudroom with a washer, dryer and the only shower.
Upstairs were two bedrooms and a bath with a large tub to soak in.</TE>
<TE>   On our first night, Saturday, we scraped together a simple dinner
with the groceries we had brought with us. But on our second day we
decided to try dinner at one of the two nearby hunting lodges that
our hosts had recommended. Gus warned us that the lodges required
reservations at least 24 hours in advance. But we ignored his warning
and took a chance on getting a table for that night. It was
lunchtime, and we decided on a dry run during daylight.</TE>
<TE>   We arrived first at the Achness Hotel, in a little community of
scattered houses. After ringing the desk bell, we were greeted by a
teenage girl, who, with a great deal of gravity, informed us that
"dinner would be out of the question."</TE>
<TE>   So we backtracked to the Oykel Bridge Hotel, located on a lonely
road that leads to the west coast. When we asked about lunch, they
set up a typical but delicious Scottish buffet of Scotch eggs,
various salads, cold cuts, breads, cheeses, liver pate and desserts.
When we asked if we could come back for dinner that night we were
politely told that they required 24 hours' notice. Back to the
cottage we went for scrambled eggs, ham and salad.</TE>
<TE>   Later we learned the policy is not as arbitrary as it seems.
Because the hotels plan meals and provisions carefully for their
weekly guests, they couldn't accommodate drop-ins. Also, because it
was September and the end of hunting season, the hotels were about to
close for the winter and were winding down their services. We made
reservations at the Oykel Bridge for the next night by phone.</TE>
<TE>   The next day we explored the quiet town of Dornoch. The venerable
13th century Dornoch Cathedral, built of yellow sandstone and looking
like a castle, dominates its center. The town bookstore, around the
corner from the Tourist Information Center, had helpful owners and a
great selection of books on the area. But the town's main claim to
fame is the Royal Dornoch Golf Links on Dornoch Firth.</TE>
<TE>   Just outside Dornoch is Skibo Castle, which achieved its most
recent fame as the site of Madonna's wedding, although it has a more
notable history. Originally the home of a distinguished Scots family,
it was purchased by Andrew Carnegie, the American steel tycoon, in
1898. An impoverished 13-year-old when he left his native Scotland,
he returned as one of the wealthiest men of his generation. He spent
a fortune rebuilding the castle and used it as a retreat. It has been
converted into a genteel and pricey hotel, private club and golf
course. It is not visible from the road, but it is worth a detour
just to see the luxurious public rooms on the ground floor.</TE>
<TE>   While Skibo Castle exudes the gentility of an English gentlemen's
club, Dunrobin Castle, still a private residence of the descendants
of the dukes of Sutherland, has the opulence of the Victorian age. It
is the largest house in the northern Highlands and one of Britain's
oldest continuously inhabited homes.</TE>
<TE>   The Sutherlands at one time were among the largest landowners in
Western Europe and played a part in the infamous "Highland
Clearances" of the early 19th century, forcing peasants off the land
to make way for sheep. Thousands of crofters emigrated or perished.</TE>
<TE>   Only 10% of the castle is open to the public, but the views of the
North Sea from some of the rooms make it worth a visit. It looks like
something torn from the pages of an old children's storybook, with
its round turrets, conical spires and gray granite exterior. Although
it has 13th century origins, it was rebuilt in the 19th century to
replicate a French chateau. With its fairy-tale appearance and its
formal Italianate gardens that march to the sea, Dunrobin seems out
of place in this wild country.</TE>
<TE>   At the Oykel Bridge Hotel that night, we were surprised to
discover that, in spite of the hotel's casual air and rustic
furnishings, guests dressed for dinner, which was served promptly
after the 8:10 p.m. gong. Men wore sport coats or suits, and women
wore anything from long skirts to cocktail dresses. We overheard
affable conversations around us, mostly about fishing.</TE>
<TE>   Fishing is taken very seriously here in Scotland. In the reception
hall I leafed through a leather-bound ledger in which fishermen
recorded their catch of the day, listing the date, type of fish,
weight and where it was caught.</TE>
<TE>   As we waited in the lounge for drinks to be served, I chuckled to
hear one man with a very English accent order a martini "with just a
teardrop of vermouth, if you please!"</TE>
<TE>   The weekly guests sat at the tables apparently assigned to them
for the duration of their stay, while we were seated at a rather
inconspicuous table beside the kitchen door. For two people who had
been dining on scrambled eggs, the table and the buffet meal--of
lentil soup, deep-fried prawns, roast beef, potatoes, green beans,
carrots, rolls and three desserts in addition to fruit and
cheeses--were more than satisfactory.</TE>
<TE>   I had set aside the next day to hunt for ruins. Since Don is not a
sightseer, he stayed at the cottage and took walks on the days I went
exploring by car. I had become intrigued with prehistoric ruins,
known as brochs and cairns, after reading about them in guidebooks
and seeing a BBC film. In certain regions, primarily in remote areas
of western Scotland, the ruins are the only evidence of human
occupation during the Bronze Age.</TE>
<TE>   The Ferrycroft Countryside Centre outside Lairg, about a 45-minute
drive from the cottage, had an archeological walking trail on Ord
Hill that led to several cairns. Some were 5,000 years old, but only
one--at the top of the hill--was still standing. As I reached the
crest and the cairn came into view, a Highlands wind hit me in the
face and gave me a taste of the rugged weather here.</TE>
<TE>   The cairn, which resembled a massive pile of rocks, looked no
worse for wear. About 6 feet high and 50 feet in diameter, it had an
entryway to underground chambers that was visible, although collapsed
inside. The chambers were used to bury the dead, the brochure said,
but some experts believe they may also have been used for ceremonies.</TE>
<TE>   My walk took longer than I had expected, and I turned back,
putting off my visit to another relic for another day.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday I drove north, 30 miles past Lairg on a one-lane road,
with only the company of the BBC, which was talking about bird life
in the Orkney Islands and the history of barbed wire. In the meantime
I enjoyed the spectacular scenery, since speed was not an option on
the narrow, winding blacktop. I had seen no cars in my rearview
mirror. Only a handful had passed me going in the opposite direction,
a maneuver that involved either me or the other car pulling off into
a signed "passing place" to allow the other to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   According to my detailed British Ordnance Survey map, a road
turned left outside the village of Altnaharra, and Dun Dornadilla
broch was about 10 miles farther. Just before Altnaharra, which was
hardly a town, I spotted a white frame building with "Altnaharra
Hotel" on the front in large letters.</TE>
<TE>   There were a few cars in the parking lot, but when I entered the
hotel, not a soul was in sight. In the bar I found a bell on the
counter and jangled it. A smiling young woman bustled in from the
kitchen, wiping her hands.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I get some lunch?" I inquired with trepidation, remembering
the reception at the other hotels when we showed up unplanned.</TE>
<TE>   I could, but there were no choices--only celery soup and a dinner
roll, but it was enough to sustain me for my trip to the broch.</TE>
<TE>   After another 30 minutes' drive, Dun Dornadilla broch appeared
beside the road overlooking the picturesque Strathmore River Valley.
Ben Hope, at 3,000 feet one of the country's highest mountains,
loomed to the north. Part of the broch's tower was still standing,
but much of it has been destroyed over the ages. A large plaque
described its purpose and history. Brochs, built by people of the
Bronze Age, are above-ground, circular stacked stone structures 30 to
40 feet in diameter and about 30 feet high, with hollow walls 15 feet
thick and a turf or thatched roof. The outer walls were built with an
inward slant, so they resemble the cooling towers of an atomic
generator. Archeologists are not sure of their purpose, but brochs
may have served as short-term defenses during intertribal battles.
Dun Dornadilla was impressive, a sentinel in the wilderness, and
while it lacked the visual impact of a castle, to my mind it was more
amazing, given its age.</TE>
<TE>   Consulting the map again, I saw the northern coast was only
another 12 or so miles up the road. But if I went that far I would
feel compelled to continue exploring, and I just didn't have the
time. I had to head back to the cottage because our host had invited
us for a drink at 7 p.m. I turned back, more confident on my return
trip now that I knew I faced nothing more formidable than wandering
sheep.</TE>
<TE>   I made it back in time to enjoy a glass of wine just as darkness
started to close in on the view of the loch outside the lodge's
drawing room window. As I stood there watching the colors of the
sunset, I realized that anywhere you go in the Highlands is a feast.
A feast for the eyes.</TE>

<DL>SEGOVIA, Spain</DL>
<LD>Looking back on it, I'm sure it was just confusion over English
grammar, but it was one of the best pieces of advice I got in
Segovia: the Plaza Mayor, a Segovian told me, is the place "to get
down."</LD>
<LD>   Segovia is northwest of Madrid, only about an hour and a half by
train, so it's often recommended as a nice day trip from the capital.
Segovia's lofty position--it rises above the surrounding terrain--may
be why many Spanish monarchs chose to live here. It appeals to that
instinct to repair to the high ground, where you can keep a close eye
on anyone who might approach.</LD>
<LD>   The city rests on an arrow-shaped hill whose steep-sided point is
framed by the confluence of the Eresma and Clamores rivers. From some
angles it looks like a ship, with the Alcazar at its bow, the raised
Plaza Mayor as its bridge and the towering cathedral as its mainmast.</LD>
<TE>   With my wife, Janice, and son, Paul, I stopped in Segovia earlier
this year, intending to use it merely as a place to recover from jet
lag before moving on. But we found ourselves returning repeatedly to
the hotel desk, asking, "Would it be all right if we stayed another
night?"</TE>
<TE>   With its spires, storks and spirit, Segovia held us, even after
the jet lag evaporated.</TE>
<TE>   The first portents had not been promising. On the train trip to
Segovia from Madrid, during which I repeatedly nodded off, I kept
waking with a start and seeing increasingly threatening weather in
the Sierra de Guadarrama, the diagonal slash of mountains through the
region northwest of Madrid. The skies were the color of slate, and
the wind blew icy snowflakes parallel to the ground, so that they
came at the train like vengeful bees.</TE>
<TE>   As the train entered Segovia, however, the sinister clouds
relented and allowed a few natural spotlights on the landscape. Then
more good luck at the Segovia station. It is well outside the city
center and beyond the edge of our guidebook's map, and we had no idea
how to get downtown. But we boarded the bus that everyone else seemed
to be taking.</TE>
<TE>   Sensing our confusion, a fellow rider told us we should "get down
in the Plaza Mayor," a syntactical snarl rather than a '70s sentiment
that made us smile. But, indeed, the Plaza Mayor is the place to get
down. The plaza, or main square, is the highest point in this town of
54,000, so it makes a useful reference point for all travel within
the city.</TE>
<TE>   But it also is of historical interest, particularly for Americans:
This is where the "Infanta Isabel" was crowned Queen Isabella of
Castile in 1474. A few years later she and her husband, Ferdinand V
of Aragon, would finance the explorations of Christopher Columbus.</TE>
<TE>   The Plaza Mayor makes the logistics of Segovia easy for visitors.
Need a hotel? You'll find one at the edge of the plaza. Hungry? There
are restaurants, cafes and bars at the other edge. Want to shop? Just
down that alley. Want to tour the cathedral? Not a problem.</TE>
<TE>   So we chose the Hotel Infanta Isabel, right on the square. City
officials try to keep the square's appearance authentically historic,
but fortunately this requirement does not extend to hotel interiors,
and we found our accommodations comfortable, modern and convenient.</TE>
<TE>   As we stepped out of the hotel each morning, we were greeted by
the formidable presence of the Cathedral of St. Mary across the
plaza. Although some guidebooks characterize it as "ladylike," that
would be true only if the lady in question were inordinately fond of
hat pins: Its fair-complexioned stone exterior bristles with pointy
spires. Not consecrated until 1768, it is one of the Continent's last
Gothic constructions.</TE>
<TE>   The interior was cool and subdued under a 100-foot ceiling, a
reverent setting for an ornate choir and organ reposing within a
fancy grillwork, and a marble altar holding the relics of St. Frutos
(also called Fructus), an 8th century hermit and one of the city's
patron saints. (His brother and sister, Valentine and Engratia, also
are patron saints of Segovia.) Stepping out through a side door, we
found a peaceful cloister garden framed by walls of Moorish-style
windows.</TE>
<TE>   The church also serves another purpose, as a resting place for
storks. During the day we would see a few of them here and there
nesting on towers and chimneys, but as night fell, squadrons of them
would return from wherever they had spent the day.</TE>
<TE>   Watching them perch was fascinating; one of these large, almost
pterodactyl-looking creatures would soar in and, through some kind of
aerodynamic braking maneuver, settle onto the tip of a cathedral
spire. They apparently stayed there, balancing like that in their
sleep, all night long.</TE>
<TE>   From the cathedral, after a walk of a few blocks down the Marques
del Arco, we were at the Alcazar, and we could see why some swear
that it's the inspiration for the Sleeping Beauty castle at
Disneyland. (It's not; that honor goes to Neuschwanstein, "Mad" King
Ludwig's castle near Fussen, Germany.) With its witch's-hat towers
and multiple turrets, it looks like something Walt Disney could have
filled with imprisoned princesses, gallant heroes and talking mice.</TE>
<TE>   Replacing earlier fortifications, the Alcazar took its present
form, more or less, in the early 15th century. It was nearly
destroyed by fire in 1862 and ultimately reconstructed, but not until
1940. Its imposing walls were built out of the milky butterscotch
stone that typifies much of Segovia's construction.</TE>
<TE>   It's also the kind of place that lends itself to legends. Royal
marriages took place here; royal families lived here; on her
coronation day young Isabella began her stately procession to the
Plaza Mayor from here.</TE>
<TE>   We crossed over the drawbridge and entered the royal quarters.
Although the furnishings, stained glass and assembled memorabilia are
interesting, the best parts of the interior were over our heads:
ornamented beamed ceilings, ceilings of gilded hexagons, elegant
arches. We needed a good neck massage when the tour was over.</TE>
<TE>   Then we climbed the 140 steps of the castle's twisting staircase
to the platform at the top of its Tower of Juan II. The view back
toward the city, with the cloud-enshrouded mountains and the
spectacular cathedral forming a backdrop, made it seem as though the
castle had been designed not for city defense but for photography.</TE>
<TE>   Equally photogenic is the city's Roman aqueduct, trailing from the
other end of town--what would be the stern of Segovia's "ship." The
aqueduct is almost 2,000 years old and about half a mile long, a row
of stone arches stacked on another row of stone arches, to a height
of 95 feet. Scholars think it was started in the late 1st or early
2nd century. It appears to be in perfect shape, although it was built
without mortar.</TE>
<TE>   Like some kind of early, oversize Lego set, the heavy stone blocks
are held in place by carefully placed hooks and grooves. It once was
a section of a system that channeled the snowmelt from the Frio
River, about 10 miles away, across the valleys to the city. Built-in
cisterns were used to settle the sediment out of the water before its
distribution. The Moors destroyed some of the arches in 1072 as
Toledo-based Muslim armies conquered the city. The aqueduct remained
in disrepair until 1483, when Isabella ordered its restoration.</TE>
<TE>   The aqueduct is one of the oldest artifacts in Segovia, whose
origins are uncertain because the Romans left little documentation of
their possession of the area. As in much of Spain, Romans were
followed by Visigoths who, in turn, gave way to Moors. Before the
Inquisition and the expulsion of the Moors from Spain in the 15th
century, Jews, Muslims and Christians shared the city, apparently
with little discord. Thus some of Segovia's buildings display
intricate geometric designs characteristic of the work of the Muslim
stonemasons and construction tradesmen who lived here in the 14th and
15th centuries.</TE>
<TE>   Segovia's version of Versailles is about seven miles out of town
at the village of La Granja, which we reached easily by bus. The
palace of San Ildefonso began as a hunting lodge in about 1400. In
the 18th century it was expanded by King Felipe V into a grand
country retreat. The mountains alone would have been a dramatic
setting, but the palace's architects embellished that with trees
imported from throughout the world, and fountains and waterfalls.</TE>
<TE>   The interior creates a "hall of mirrors" effect--long avenues of
rooms filled with statuary, crystal and furniture you can't sit on
(and one wonders if anyone ever did). One wing has been taken over as
a tapestry museum and displays floor-to-ceiling woven depictions of
religious themes.</TE>
<TE>   Though the tapestries were executed in the 16th century, their
colors remain intense. The horrific scenes from the Book of
Revelation are appropriately vivid, and the horsemen of the
Apocalypse clearly remind the sinner to shape up while there is still
time.</TE>
<TE>   La Granja is known also for something slightly less regal: beans,
big beans. When I first saw judiones, I thought perhaps Europe had
overcome its resistance to genetically engineered foods. But they are
natural, even though they look like lima beans grown too close to a
nuclear plant. They are about the size of chicken livers, and they
taste almost meaty. They often are served with the spicy local
sausages, but I found them tasty by themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Any virtue I can claim from eating such a healthy dish probably
was offset by another Segovian favorite, roast suckling pig. As in
other Spanish cities, Segovian dinners start late by American
standards. We arrived at Restaurante Jose on the Plaza Mayor at 7:30.
We were seated, but for the next half-hour we sat awkwardly watching
the waiters fold napkins and polish silverware.</TE>
<TE>   We were still the only customers when the waiters started serving
at 8:15. But the pig was worth the wait. Served whole with excellent
little French fries, its skin was crispy and its fatty flesh
succulent. I stifled my conscience, which kept recalling children's
book images of playful piglets frolicking in meadows. And the tab for
suckling pig for three was about $35, with wine.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday was market day--and rainy. We moved from awning to awning
between the vendors' booths along the streets off the Plaza Mayor. I
like open markets because they put me among the people of my host
country. The rain put me even closer to them as all of us tried to
find shelter around the tables of fresh produce. Segovia's Thursday
markets have been taking place like this for centuries, albeit with a
few twists. Thus, when Janice bought some fresh oranges, even though
the vendors rang up her purchases on electronic registers with
digital read-outs displaying her change in both euros and pesetas,
she was participating in a centuries-old tradition.</TE>
<TE>   We saved the Church of Vera Cruz for a sunny day, our last here.
Consecrated in 1208 by the Knights Templar, a religious military
order, the church lies exposed on a bare knoll outside the city walls
on the low-lying north bank of the Eresma River. It is an oddly
shaped building--a low-rise 12-sided polygon with a four-story bell
tower at one corner. Inside it was dark and still, with heraldic
banners draped beneath an arched ceiling. We climbed to a central
balcony and looked down into the small chapel. Seven centuries ago we
would have seen young men in prayer about to be accepted into the
knighthood to embark on their careers of chivalry and violence.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later we took a cab to the bus station and embarked
on further adventures of our own in Iberia. We would see more castles
and monuments and, of course, more churches. But I retain a special
fondness for Segovia. I can see myself there again, exploring old
neighborhoods, learning their history, eating beans--and getting down
in the Plaza Mayor.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: Charlie Jakab of North Hollywood was vacationing on
the South Pacific islands of Moorea and Tahiti a year ago when he
encountered a traveler's worst enemy: rain. One day he took cover in
this market in the Tahitian city of Papeete, the capital of French
Polynesia. Enough sun filtered through dark clouds and the building's
skylights to illuminate row upon row of fresh fruit. "I was surprised
to see the picture turn out so well," says Jakab, who spent most of
his eight days on Moorea. "Although it rained quite a few times, I
still had a blast."</CP>

<HD>New Air Security Could Bring Surprise Benefits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SPANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Get to the airport early. Be ready to take off your shoes as you go
through security. Don't pack a corkscrew or a cricket bat in your
carry-on luggage.</LD>
<LD>   Although I seldom carry on a cricket bat, my air travel habits
have changed because of heightened airport security. I used to carry
on as much as possible so I could zip out of my destination airport
without having to stop to retrieve bags. Now I carry on very little
to avoid trouble at security. I've also started using curbside
baggage check-in because I can go directly to security without
standing in line at the ticket counter.</LD>
<LD>   The new security measures have made me a better, happier traveler
now that I no longer stagger down airport concourses burdened with
baggage. And it also seems that the heightened security has had some
strikingly positive effects on the way the airlines handle checked
luggage. The Department of Transportation says the incidence of
mishandled baggage--luggage that is damaged, delayed, pilfered or
lost--has declined since Sept. 11. In February, major American
carriers reported 3.85 cases of mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers,
compared with 4.88 in February 2001. Of course, that may, in part, be
a result of decreased passenger loads.</LD>
<TE>   Since the DOT instituted a security procedure known as "positive
bag matching" on Jan. 18, it has become impossible--at least
theoretically--for the airlines to lose or misdirect checked bags.
The procedure makes it necessary for flight crews to determine that
everybody who is supposed to be on a plane is there. If the manifest
reflects a no-show, that passenger's luggage is removed before
takeoff. It's a fairly rudimentary precaution that keeps terrorists
from planting explosives in checked luggage and disappearing. But it
has loopholes: It doesn't deter suicide bombers, and positive bag
matching has not been mandated for luggage that is transferred when
passengers make connections.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, positive bag matching hasn't gridlocked air travel.
Airport security experts like Houston-based Charlie LeBlanc, managing
director of Air Security International, say that positive bag
matching slows down the system only when a no-show forces the airline
to retrieve bags before departure. But with computerized baggage
locator systems, removing suspect bags rarely takes more than 10
minutes, LeBlanc says.</TE>
<TE>   The near elimination of lost bags could be an unintended benefit.
"Hopefully it will lessen bag loss, though that's not the first
concern of the Transportation Security Administration," says Deirdre
O'Sullivan, a spokesperson for the TSA, a branch of the DOT that
handles transportation security.</TE>
<TE>   There is a downside to positive bag matching, as far as I'm
concerned: People who get to the airport well ahead of time and check
their bags can't take an earlier flight if they find one because they
must fly on the same plane as their checked bags.</TE>
<TE>   The bag matching probably will continue after Dec. 31, the date
Congress set for the addition of thousands of high-tech checked
baggage screening systems at airports, the DOT says.</TE>
<TE>   These include an explosive trace detector, or ETD, a system that
requires operators to pass a wand around baggage in search of bomb
material residue, and a computerized explosives detecting system, or
EDS, which finds explosives in the same way medical CT scans locate
tumors.</TE>
<TE>   These machines will bring more changes to air travel. They are
"going to slow down the system," says Jerome Greer Chandler, safety
and security editor for the online magazine
www.frequentflyer.oag.com. "How much, we just don't know."</TE>
<TE>   The explosives detecting system is faster than the explosive trace
detector. It can scan bags in 10 seconds. If it sees something
suspicious, it does a further assessment, which takes about 30
seconds. Don Mattson, chief operating officer of InVision
Technologies Inc., a Bay Area company that makes the EDS (each costs
$700,000 to $1.5 million), says that 80% of checked bags will go
through the machines without a hitch but that 20% will require the
30-second resolution procedure.</TE>
<TE>   If the EDS can't resolve the problem, airport security officials
will bring in explosive-sniffing dogs. In a worst-case scenario, the
owner will be tracked down for questioning and the bag isolated, then
destroyed. (This occurred in April at San Francisco International
Airport, where a pair of loafers equipped with battery-operated foot
warmers was found in a salesman's bag. Bomb experts took the shoes to
a shooting range, where they were riddled with bullets.)</TE>
<TE>   EDS scanners have drawbacks. The machines are the size of a
minivan, and no one--from airport officials to security experts to
the DOT--knows yet where they will be installed. There are two
options: in departure lobbies or behind the scenes, integrated into
the baggage handling system.</TE>
<TE>   LAX, which could get as many as 17 EDS scanners in each of its
nine terminals, is studying the problem. "We can't picture having
that many machines in ticket counter areas. There would be no room
for people," says Nancy Castles, an LAX spokesperson.</TE>
<TE>   So air travelers must get ready for more changes and adjustments.
But I'm trying to remain optimistic. Besides making it safer to fly,
maybe the new scanning machines, like positive bag matching, will
have benefits no one has thought of yet.</TE>

<HD>Things Are Looking Festive</HD>
<DH>And still, the awards shows continue. On this week's
schedule: the Tony, Essence and MTV Movie celebrations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is no such thing as an awards season on television anymore
because there seems to be no end to the glitzy specials honoring
movies, music, theater, television, sports figures, the fashion
industry, teachers, racial diversity--you name it.</LD>
<LD>   This week alone, three vastly different awards shows will be
telecast: CBS and PBS are home to the Tony Awards, which honor the
best of Broadway theater; Fox has the Essence Awards, a
noncompetitive ceremony that pays tribute to the accomplishments of
African Americans; and MTV presents its irreverent anti-awards show,
"The MTV Movie Awards."</LD>
<LD>   The Tony Awards, now in their 25th year on CBS, are considered
among the classiest due to their presentation of colorful musical
numbers from nominated shows and the top Broadway talent they tap for
hosts and presenters. This year, former Tony winners Bernadette
Peters and Gregory Hines share emcee duty. The first hour airs on
PBS, then CBS takes over for the final two.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike the other two awards shows this week, the Tony Awards are
done live, though broadcast-delayed on the West Coast. "This is the
tightest of all the major awards shows," says veteran executive
producer Gary Smith. "The rule is, you're off at 11." Having PBS
carry the first 10 awards has been a big help in keeping to the
strict 11 p.m. sign-off.</TE>
<TE>   The two telecasts differ, Smith says, with PBS including
mini-documentaries on such technical nominees as costume and lighting
designers. "They give you the whole feeling of what the season has
been like," he says, "so by the time we get to the Tonys on CBS, we
have a nice hour insight into all that went on and it is not just the
awards."</TE>
<TE>   Smith acknowledges that the Tonys are never a ratings blockbuster.
"I really believe the Tonys rating is the Tonys rating. It tends
basically to be the same kind of rating every year. The ratings
variation has less to do with the show and maybe more to do with
what's up against it. If the Lakers happen to be against us, it will
hurt the L.A. market."</TE>
<TE>   Suzanne de Passe, an Emmy Award-winning and Oscar-nominated
producer-writer, is taking her first stab at producing the Essence
Awards, which air Thursday on Fox. For the past two years, she's been
executive producer of the NAACP Image Awards.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the ceremony has moved from New York to the Universal
Amphitheatre, although Steve Harvey is returning as host. The
honorees, chosen by the editors of Essence, include Halle Berry,
Terry McMillan, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and Alicia Keyes.</TE>
<TE>   De Passe believes an awards show should never wear out its
welcome. "I consider the shelf life of an awards show slightly longer
than a fish," she says, laughing. "After that, it starts stinking up
the joint. It's s very tough to keep it exciting."</TE>
<TE>   Going into his 10th year as producer and creator of the MTV Movie
Awards, which also airs Thursday, Joel Gallen admits he has a
love-hate relationship with the outrageous show that spoofs current
hit movies and features such off-the-wall categories as best kiss and
best villain. This year, actor-singer Jack Black and "Buffy the
Vampire Slayer" star Sarah Michelle Gellar are the co-hosts.</TE>
<TE>   "I did it the first two years and then I swore I'd never come
back," Gallen says. "I do a lot of other shows and projects and
films, and I still feel every year I do the show it's my biggest
challenge. I have over the years, though, stopped trying to put the
pressure on myself that we have to top what we did last year."</TE>
<TE>   The MTV awards are taped before an audience at the Shrine
Auditorium five days before they're telecast. Gallen doesn't feel the
show has suffered because it's never been telecast live.</TE>
<TE>   "When I created the show, I always said this show should not be
live because this is not really an awards show. It's an entertainment
show, a comedy show. I think awards are important, and the fact that
the celebrities come out to pick up their awards--that's all great.
But to make it the whole package of what this show really represents,
it's good to have a few extra days to add extra layers of comedy and

<HD>The Shark Makes His Presence Felt</HD>

<AU>THOMAS BOSWELL</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the golf fans at the Kemper Open couldn't get the Tiger they
wanted, they were happy to settle for the Shark they've enjoyed for
so long. At least for one day, anyway.</LD>
<LD>   Greg Norman always has been the most charismatic, romantic and
controversial player in the 22-year history of the Kemper. He's done
it all here--good, bad and zany.</LD>
<LD>   Now, at 47, and without a Tour victory in five years, the aging
Norman--part-time golfer, full-time professional celebrity and
world-class businessman--is back in town.</LD>
<TE>   Wouldn't you know it, he started the tournament right where the
Kemper needs him--in the middle of a leader board dominated by names
such as Watts, Williamson and Wood.</TE>
<TE>   The Chairman of Great White Shark Enterprises--a multinational
corporation involved in golf course design, residential development,
apparel sales, an interactive Web site (www.shark.com), golf
equipment distribution, restaurants, a vineyard and a line of
yachts--shot 67 in his first round. This guy even makes money off
grass. The Super Bowl once used Greg Norman Turf.</TE>
<TE>   If nobody calls on Norman's cell phone in the next three days to
set up some international merger in Sydney, he might have a chance
for one last moment of twilight golf glory.</TE>
<TE>   Please, don't anybody suggest that Norman hop in his private
helicopter to go to his private jet so that he can swing some big
Asian acquisition. He might be tempted. Corporate titan-ship holds
his love these days, but for a week, he can definitely squeeze golf
back into his heart.</TE>
<TE>   For a man who's only had four top-10 finishes since 1997, but
endured two major surgeries, this is a fine chance to show the golf
world he's not washed up. All that rehab was worth the trouble. And
his hip surgery--with video on the Internet--wasn't just to provide,
shall we say, "unique" programming for his Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "A win would mean a lot to me," said Norman, who has had only one
contending chance this season, starting the final round of the
Houston Open in sixth place, but fading to 23rd with a 76. "It would
be a reinforcement of the belief in myself that I can do it."</TE>
<TE>   No golfer has ever needed that resilient "belief in myself" more
than Norman, with his six heart-breaking runner-up finishes in major
championships--some self-inflicted, but most the result of miracle
shots against him.</TE>
<TE>   And no golfer has ever lost on the world stage, rebounded and
tried again with more good grace than Norman.</TE>
<TE>   He even had the grit to put his hand back in the fire at the
Masters in '99, finishing third, after his seven-shot blown lead with
a final-round 78 in '96.</TE>
<TE>   "If I didn't think I could put myself in position to win this golf
tournament, I wouldn't be here, trust me," Norman said.</TE>
<TE>   Logic, history, precedent? Why bow to that? Even Jack Nicklaus
never won again after his Masters at 46. But Norman thinks he will.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got too many other things I love to do in life to come out
here and feel like I'm just walking around the golf course," said
Norman, who ran off three straight birdies at the 14th, 15th and 16th
holes with birdie putts of 12, 24 and 12 feet. "So it really would be
the fulfillment of how I feel inside that, yes, you can still do it.</TE>
<TE>   "And today was a good indication of that, even though it was only
one round."</TE>
<TE>   If the rocks and creeks at Avenel know what's good for them, they
will give Norman every good bounce the next three days. Because if
they don't, he may just replace the whole darn course and move the
Kemper to a track of his own in a few years.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Norman discussed his plans for a $20 million elite
course at the Lansdowne Resort near Leesburg, Va. There's already
talk that, after the current Kemper-Avenel contract runs out in 2006,
Norman's layout might eventually get some of the Kemper action.</TE>
<TE>   That's a long way down the road, but if Norman rattles a few into
the woods, the oaks and pines might keep it in mind. Someday,
Chairman Shark might hold this course's fate in his fins.</TE>
<TE>   If Norman somehow beat the long odds and capped his Tour career
with one last victory, it would certainly feel appropriate if he did
it here in the Kemper. His first PGA Tour victory came in 1984 at
Congressional, where he repeated in '86. Since the Kemper moved to
the TPC at Avenel, he's often excited the crowds with near misses,
finishing third once and fourth on three occasions.</TE>
<TE>   At other choice Kemper moments, he's gently suggested course
changes ("blow up the ninth hole"), given the finger to the crowd,
annoyed promoters by pulling out belatedly and even berated the
first-tee announcer for making a joke at his expense.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, this is Norman's first trip back to the Kemper since that
famous first-tee dustup when the announcer made a remark about
President Bill Clinton falling down the stairs at Norman's house in
Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "It's water over the dam," Norman said earlier this week. "I
thought what he said was in bad taste. Whenever you have a situation
like that, that's very personal to you, it's hard for someone else to
make a flippant remark like that. And that's what I told him. But
that didn't stop me from coming back here."</TE>
<TE>   Norman, a prodigious driver, was once almost a prohibitive
over-dog when he arrived here. From his wealth to his glamour to a
fame disproportionate to his two major championships, Norman was an
easy target for Tour resentment.</TE>
<TE>   But, in sports, where the normal life cycle is accelerated, age
changes all. At a point when he's still a corporate up-and-comer,
Norman is now a golf old man, an underdog routinely outdistanced by
young pups.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because you get out-driven doesn't mean to say you (have to)
get outplayed. Length is a huge advantage. I was a testament to
that," Norman said.</TE>
<TE>   "So (as) you get older, you lose some of that ability ... (but)
you just work with what your game is."</TE>
<TE>   Such as that golf game is and as long as it lasts, the Kemper Open
will gladly take it.</TE>
<TE>   You never know when a Shark sighting on the leader board--once so
common here -- could be the last.</TE>

<HD>They're More Than Football Fans</HD>
<DH>Women's league has many serious players trying to make
their mark while balancing lives away from the field.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL NEWBERRY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>DECATUR, Ga.</DL>
<LD>The idea of playing football--the real kind, with tackling and
blocking and everything else--first came to Jennifer Frederick in
sixth grade. She approached the principal about getting a permission
slip for her parents to sign.</LD>
<LD>   He refused. She was a girl. Everyone knew that girls don't play
football.</LD>
<LD>   Frederick didn't fare much better when she got home. She told her
mom and dad, only to learn they were in the principal's corner. No
way they were going to let their daughter put on a helmet and pads,
and take the field with a bunch of boys.</LD>
<TE>   "I tried to argue it out at home and wound up getting grounded,"
Frederick recalled. "I got two weeks of washing dishes and cleaning
the house because I wanted to play football."</TE>
<TE>   All grown up now, she's finally getting a chance to fulfill her
dream with the Atlanta Leopards, an expansion team in the fledgling
National Women's Football League. Never mind that she had to buy her
own equipment. Who cares that practices and games have to be juggled
around a real job.</TE>
<TE>   No payday at the end of the week? No problem. This is football for
the true love of the sport--even if some of the players didn't know
the difference between a goal line and a goalpost.</TE>
<TE>   "I never even watched a full game on television until the Super
Bowl this year," admitted Benita Booker, who plays offensive and
defensive line for the Leopards. "But I've been out here for 10
weeks, and I'm still here--even with all the bumps and bruises. It
takes a lot of commitment."</TE>
<TE>   The NWFL is hardly big-time football.</TE>
<TE>   The Leopards practice on a ramshackle high school field east of
Atlanta, and only when the prep band and team have finished their
drills.</TE>
<TE>   Massages are given on a folding table. Practice ends when it's
impossible to see the ball on the unlighted field.</TE>
<TE>   The season opener drew about 1,200 fans, and only half that number
turned out for the second game. The team's owner, LaTonya Watters,
has to worry about more than fan support, though--you see, she's also
a starter on the offensive line.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite intensive being a player-owner," said Watters, who
somehow finds time for her 9-to-5 job as a therapist dealing with
troubled children. "I look forward to traveling to games out of
state. The responsibility is off me and I can be a player only."</TE>
<TE>   Before the first game, Watters didn't have time to go over the
playbook. She had to make sure the referees were there and the
concession stands were staffed. She had to make sure there was water
for both teams and all the bills were paid. Hmm, kind of makes George
Steinbrenner's life seem rather idyllic.</TE>
<TE>   "I was writing checks during the game," Watters said.</TE>
<TE>   Her teammates realize that all their aches and pains won't be
soothed by a million-dollar contract somewhere down the line. They
are students and police officers and accountants by trade, merely
hoping this adventure will make things easier for the next generation
of female players.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone had to pay $35 just to try out for the Leopards. Those
who made the team had to fork over more than $300 to buy their
helmet, uniform and pads. There's a chance they'll get paid something
if the team is profitable, but that seems unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   "Being pioneers, we have to pay out of our pocket for everything,"
Booker said. "It gets a little expensive, but I don't regret it a
bit."</TE>
<TE>   Neither does Randi Terry, a 155-pound defensive end with an
18-month-old son. She grew up playing basketball, soccer and
volleyball, but remembers the desperate search for someone to
emulate.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to stay up till 2 in the morning to watch women's
basketball on TV. That was about the only time it was on," said
Terry, 28. "My hope is this is one more step for women in sports."</TE>
<TE>   Frederick, a mechanic for Delta Air Lines, had more primal reasons
for trying out.</TE>
<TE>   "The other sports I played, you couldn't hit anybody without
getting in trouble," she said, grinning mischievously. "Here, if you
want to hit 'em, you can hit 'em hard."</TE>
<TE>   Make no mistake: These women will hit each other. If nothing else,
they have struck a blow against those--Frederick's former principal,
are you listening?--who don't believe females have the physical
strength or aggressive nature to send another woman crashing into the
turf.</TE>
<TE>   "These girls are out here because they want to play real
football," Terry said. "They're not afraid to hit anybody."</TE>
<TE>   M.G. Dawson heard about the league on the radio, thought it
sounded intriguing and came out to watch the tryouts. Next thing he
knew, he had a whistle around his neck and was coaching the team.</TE>
<TE>   "At least you don't have to un-teach them things," Dawson said.
"They don't have any bad habits because the game is so new to them.
They're extremely coachable, too."</TE>
<TE>   Dawson, whose day job is selling computer software, coached
briefly at North Carolina, his alma mater, but had to draw on earlier
experiences for his first practice with the Leopards.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a football field, these are goalposts, this is a
sideline," Dawson told his players. Then they went from there.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, we have to keep it simple," Dawson said. "But we have
a system, with various reverses and blitzes. It works well."</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are trying times.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent practice, the coach had to point out the goal line to
one of his players. He also went through a rudimentary session of
calling out the various special team units--kickoffs, punts, field
goals--and having the players trot out beside him if they're supposed
to be on the field.</TE>
<TE>   Several were confused by all the terminology, taking hesitant
steps in and out of line. Most of their teammates chuckled, but
quarterback Cheryl Glover didn't find it amusing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to be funny on Saturday when she's walking around
like a goober!" Glover yelled, stifling the laughter. "It's not going
to be funny on Saturday when we need her on the field."</TE>
<TE>   All right, now we're talking football. Then again, kicker Sara Ann
Hudson seemed a bit out of place when she acknowledged the kudos of
her coach after booting one through the uprights.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you," she replied kindly.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some of the women are struggling to adapt to football's
violent mindset.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to be aggressive here, but nice out there in the real
world," Booker said. "One of my friends told me, 'You're changing. I
think you're more aggressive.' We're still supposed to be different
from men. They're expected to be aggressive all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Perry, who once protected John Elway as a lineman for the
Denver Broncos, runs the Leopard offense. Nothing irritates him more
than a player who goes easy on an opponent for fear of causing an
injury. "This ain't a nice game! Don't be nice!" he screamed during
practice.</TE>
<TE>   "They've still got a little ways to go as far as being a little
mean, a little nasty," Perry said afterward. "Once you step into this
world, you've got to pay homage to it. This is my world. Don't think
you're just going to step into it."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Thirst for Energy Lures Explorers, Speculators</HD>
<DH>Canada: Talk of building a pipeline in the Northwest
Territories to transport natural gas south fuels an economic boom in
the area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM COHEN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>INUVIK, Northwest Territories--Brian Desjardins headed up to Canada's
western Arctic in 1999 to escape the pressure and hassle of urban
life down south. It hasn't quite worked out that way.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of hunting caribou across the frozen tundra, the tourism
and fund-raising coordinator for the town of Inuvik finds himself
planning conferences and dealing with newcomers lured by the region's
latest energy boom.</LD>
<LD>   Almost daily, people throughout North America send Desjardins
e-mails asking about work and lodging in this town of 3,500--and
growing--at one of the northernmost points of mainland Canada, where
the MacKenzie River approaches the Beaufort Sea.</LD>
<TE>   The frontier environment he first encountered has become a
mini-metropolis, with diesel trucks cramming MacKenzie Road and a
months-long wait for housing. Desjardins, 30, laughs at the irony.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the reasons I came up here was to kind of slow down, get
out of the rat race," he said. "If anything, the pace has gotten
faster."</TE>
<TE>   The excitement comes from renewed talk about building a pipeline
to transport natural gas from the MacKenzie Delta region to points
south.</TE>
<TE>   Increasing U.S. demand, now backed by the Bush administration's
desire for North American energy sources to reduce dependency on
overseas supplies, is the main catalyst for Inuvik's growth spurt.</TE>
<TE>   The heated debate in the U.S. over a proposal to drill for oil in
the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge--recently rejected by the Senate
while supported by the House--also has invigorated the idea of
pipelines to carry gas from Alaska and Canada to the lower 48 states.</TE>
<TE>   Pipeline talk began three decades ago with the discovery of Arctic
gas deposits, setting off an initial exploration boom in the Inuvik
area. But unsettled land and economic rights of the region's
indigenous peoples derailed the idea.</TE>
<TE>   With that issue resolved in recent years, confidence about rising
U.S. demand for energy has brought back the explorers and
speculators.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the primary motivating factors is the anticipated
increased growth and the anticipated increased demand from the Lower
48," said Hart Searle, spokesman for a consortium of energy producers
studying a possible pipeline along the MacKenzie River valley. "The
market makes it all go 'round. You've got to have confidence in the
market."</TE>
<TE>   A pipeline is seen by some as the railroad of Canada's north,
opening the Arctic to increasing development and changing forever how
its people live--particularly the Inuit and Indians of the endless
tundra. Some see that as a negative, bringing pollution and other
environmental stresses. Others see it as a boon for a region facing
the shift from a traditional economy of hunting and trapping to the
job-based economy of the south.</TE>
<TE>   A 1977 government report by Thomas Berger that opposed building
the pipeline warned of roads, airstrips, river wharves and other
permanent transportation links that would bring thousands of
tractors, earthmovers, trucks and barges to a region accessible only
by air, water and winter ice roads.</TE>
<TE>   Although Searle says a decision on whether to build a pipeline
remains years away, change in the MacKenzie Delta is already evident.
More than 1,000 workers fill exploration camps dotting the frozen
Beaufort Sea and delta region; the myriad ice roads dotted with
signposts pointing the way to various projects even have stop signs
at some intersections.</TE>
<TE>   In Inuvik, construction workers are building new housing and
renovating dormant camps and dwellings left over from the boom in the
1970s. Offices for companies with names like Tundra Tech and Arctic
Digital have opened, and old-timers talk of new faces crowding the
eateries where they get their caribou and musk ox burgers.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole character of the place has changed quite significantly:
A lot of people. A lot of activity. Everybody's busy. Prices have
gone up," said John Nagy, an environmental researcher for the
Northwest Territories government who first came north in the previous
boom.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the region, the main question is whether the
development and accompanying dollars will continue this time or
disappear again, as they did when the first boom fizzled in the late
'70s.</TE>
<TE>   "We all talk about the things we really care about, but when you
really come down to the harsh reality, the economics of the pipeline
is what's going to drive it," said Nellie Cournoyea, an Inuit leader
who heads Inuvialuit Regional Corp., which controls her people's
traditional lands.</TE>
<TE>   Various pipeline plans exist, with two getting the most serious
consideration. One would carry gas from Alaska across Canada's Yukon
Territory to hook up with a broader distribution network in Alberta.</TE>
<TE>   The other, at an estimated cost of more than $1.3 billion, would
follow the MacKenzie River from near the Beaufort Sea to Alberta,
running for more than 780 miles through the Northwest Territories.</TE>
<TE>   An alternative would include a connecting arm beneath the Beaufort
Sea to Alaska, but the extra construction and bureaucratic demands of
dealing with U.S. and Canadian politics and regulators make the
Canadian-only plan the front-runner for now.</TE>
<TE>   Searle's MacKenzie Delta Producers Group comprises four
companies--Imperial Oil Ltd., Conoco Canada Resources Ltd., Shell
Canada Ltd. and ExxonMobil Canada--with Cournoyea's MacKenzie Valley
Aboriginal Pipeline Corp. as a partner.</TE>
<TE>   That partnership is the kind of deal envisaged by Berger in his
1977 report, considered a milestone in government-aboriginal
relations. He said then that the Inuit and Indian communities needed
the protection of land claims treaties and partnership agreements to
deal with the irrevocable change of Arctic development.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Berger said in a telephone interview, aboriginal communities
"have the opportunity to have an ownership interest in the pipeline
and to participate in whatever spinoffs there are."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Inuvialuit treaty gives Cournoyea's people control
over their traditional lands, she said they also needed the
partnership deal with the producer group to guarantee a role in
building the pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, they didn't have to deal with us," Cournoyea said of the
energy companies. "But even though there's a [land] claim, we really
have to work hard to be dealt with in a meaningful way, you know?"</TE>
<TE>   Inuvik Mayor Peter Clarkson, overseeing growth expected to
increase the town's population by more than 50%, said the indigenous
land rights "mean a lot more money is staying in the north now. I
think that's a big step."</TE>
<TE>   He sees the impact in Inuvik, where building permits were issued
for construction worth $17.5 million last year, compared to $1.3
million in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Clarkson anticipates a similar figure for 2002, due in part to
construction of territorial projects including a hospital and female
youth offenders facility, along with badly needed housing. In one new
subdivision, 18 of the 24 houses going up already have been sold.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone knew that the second boom was going to come
with such a big impact," Clarkson said.</TE>
<TE>   The effect ripples throughout the region of roughly 14,000 square
miles, which has a population of less than 10,000, the overwhelming
majority aboriginal.</TE>
<TE>   Staff Sgt. Mark Wharton of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said
the present Inuvik detachment of 17 officers could increase to 28 by
2006, with a new headquarters planned. "I'm having a hard time
maintaining my guards and janitors because [those jobs] don't pay as
well" as jobs in the energy company camps, he said. More money also
brings problems, such as the cocaine that has turned up in the last
year, Wharton said.</TE>
<TE>   He believes that the changes are only beginning, because while it
may take years for the pipeline to be built, "eventually it will
happen."</TE>
<TE>   Lucy Jackson, an interpreter for tribal elders during the Berger
commission hearings three decades ago, said she worries that the
aboriginal communities lack sufficient understanding of what the
pipeline will mean. In any case, she believes that "the spinoff isn't
going to be that great."</TE>
<TE>   Searle, of the producers group, acknowledged that a pipeline would
provide only a few hundred permanent jobs after the two- or
three-year construction.</TE>
<TE>   He said the main benefit for communities would be spinoff
businesses, such as more exploration and services.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Inuvik, Cournoyea said the pipeline is needed because
aboriginal communities no longer can survive on the hunting and
trapping that sustained their ancestors. Her corporation's role is to
"lock in" as many economic benefits as possible for her people.</TE>

<HD>Taxi Driver Takes New Route After Visit to South Africa</HD>
<DH>Philanthropy: Austrian man establishes an aid organization
for poor people in a number of developing countries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VANESSA GERA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>VIENNA, Austria</DL>
<LD>Taxi driver Hannes Urban didn't start out to be anyone's savior when
he went to South Africa, but his life took a turn.</LD>
<LD>   Urban's plan was to visit one of the many pen pals he'd exchanged
letters with over the years when he flew off from Vienna in 1998.
That friendship didn't last, however.</LD>
<LD>   "My pen pal wanted to marry me, so I fled," says Urban, 45. But by
the time his vacation ended, he had discovered a deeper calling:
Shocked by the poverty he witnessed on the streets of Cape Town, he
left determined to help some of the beggars he had met there.</LD>
<TE>   "I met a homeless woman there with a sick baby," Urban says. "So I
went to the supermarket and bought her milk, yogurt, bananas. I told
her I would come back to South Africa and make sure her child goes to
kindergarten."</TE>
<TE>   Since making that promise, Urban has founded his own aid
organization, which has built a kindergarten attended by about 30
South African children a year.</TE>
<TE>   He has also launched projects in several developing countries
aimed at bringing food and medicine to poor people. Current projects
include providing medical treatment to the rural poor in Mexico and
delivering food packages to hundreds in the slums of Nairobi, Kenya.</TE>
<TE>   Urban spends half the year in those various countries. The rest of
the year he spends back in Vienna driving his taxi and raising money
for his projects.</TE>
<TE>   A Roman Catholic driven by the desire to do God's work, Urban says
he never set out to establish his own charity. "My target was simply
to help the poor and the sick."</TE>
<TE>   He describes how a string of chance events led him to found his
group, "Wir Helfen" (We Help).</TE>
<TE>   After his first visit to South Africa, Urban told his hairdresser
about the homeless woman with the baby. She wanted to send some of
her clothing to the woman. "But I told her I didn't have room in my
backpack," he recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Then, at a bar frequented by many of Vienna's taxi drivers, word
spread among the regulars that Urban planned another trip to South
Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "Before I knew it, they had collected 130 kilograms [290 pounds]
of clothing," Urban says. "I didn't know what to do, so I went to a
travel agency and asked if they could carry it as missionary goods."</TE>
<TE>   British Airways agreed to transport the material for free, and
Urban soon returned to South Africa carrying seven large cardboard
boxes of used clothes. During that two-month visit, he met Thobeka
Beatrice Sidlayi, a kindergarten teacher struggling to support her
family.</TE>
<TE>   "At my last supper there, I had the inspiration to go home, raise
money and build a kindergarten for Thobeka," he says. "I returned to
Vienna euphoric, thinking I would go from parish to parish [to raise
money], but that didn't work out because the churches already had
their own projects."</TE>
<TE>   So as he drove his taxi through Vienna, he told his customers he
was building a kindergarten in South Africa. The response was
overwhelming. "A lot of people said they wanted to donate money."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, he founded the charity to give it "an official
character." He since has had to overcome various obstacles, such as
importing into Mexico medicines donated by pharmacies in Austria.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he says, he raised $200,000. Because he lives
simply--in South Africa he lives in a hut alongside those to whom he
brings both charity and prayers--95% of what he raises goes directly
to his projects.</TE>
<TE>   Urban was recently in Mexico to bring a team of medical
professionals to poor Indian farmers at Santiago Tuxtla, in the
Mexican state of Veracruz.</TE>
<TE>   The team saw about 500 patients over six days, treating them
mainly for conditions such as diabetes, osteoporosis, high blood
pressure and skin disorders, says Angeles Garcia Brana, one of the
volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, a 43-year-old native of Spain, says the team hoped in
particular to treat women and girls, since they often receive no
medical care in impoverished Mexican communities. "The girls are also
ashamed to talk about certain parts of their body and would not say
anything about their problems, even if they're dying," she says.</TE>
<TE>   The women and girls responded with overwhelming gratitude, Garcia
says.</TE>

<HD>Trying to Engineer Solutions to Refugee Problems</HD>
<DH>Science: Existing equipment such as a water pump with bike
pedals might be used to improve living conditions in camps.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The United Nations estimates that 23 million refugees live in
virtually medieval conditions throughout Asia, Africa and the
Americas. With every civil war or natural disaster, aid groups offer
the same response: an airlift of tents and sacks of grain.</LD>
<LD>   Western scientists and engineers watching the misery say it's time
they got involved. They are offering their skills to improve living
conditions and to reduce the environmental damage left by refugee
camps.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the scientists' ideas are simple. A water pump with bike
pedals. A solar stove made of foil. Other ideas are more complex,
like a solar-powered satellite phone.</LD>
<TE>   Much of the equipment exists but has never been tried in a refugee
setting. Soon these technologies may be field-tested in barrios along
the U.S.-Mexico border as part of an ambitious "sustainable camp"
experiment sponsored by the United Nations and the Pentagon, among
others.</TE>
<TE>   The tools that are successful would be introduced in real refugee
camps from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. Perhaps refugees might carry the
equipment home where it would improve village life as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Refugees are all in one place, and they don't particularly have
anything to do," said Steve Troy, one of the program's engineering
consultants. His online clearinghouse based in Boulder, Colo.,
distributes 8,000 portable and environmentally friendly tools.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great educational opportunity," Troy said. "It makes it so
easy to demonstrate things."</TE>
<TE>   But refugee aid veterans are wary. This wouldn't be the first time
that Western scientists have arrived in a crisis bearing new gear
that is too complicated, delicate or irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   Outsiders must tread carefully and enlist the aid of both camp
administrators and tribal elders, aid workers warn. Otherwise, the
scientists risk being accused of spreading witchcraft. Or worse.</TE>
<TE>   "Refugees are very conservative people who generally are not
thinking much beyond getting their next meal," said Larry Thompson of
Refugees International, a Washington nonprofit group that is advising
the technology trials. "Nobody has very much time to experiment with
anything new, and they're not in a terribly receptive mood."</TE>
<TE>   Refugee camps are established according to a formula explained in
the United Nations' 400-page "Handbook for Emergencies."</TE>
<TE>   It's a bitter calculus. Each refugee gets 483 square feet of total
space, including footpaths. Water spigots: One every 100 meters.
Latrines: One 26-gallon pit for every 10 families. A daily ration:
2,100 calories of food and 7 to 15 liters of "reasonably clean"
water.</TE>
<TE>   In real life, camps operate less precisely.</TE>
<TE>   "One agency provides water tanks with 3-inch spigots," said Bill
Browning of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a Colorado think tank
coordinating the technology trials. "Another supplies containers with
2-inch openings. You wind up spilling water, which runs into a ditch
and breeds mosquitoes. And people get malaria.</TE>
<TE>   "All for the want of a funnel," Browning said.</TE>
<TE>   But scientists say modernizing camp life is not impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Administration would be improved by data and telecommunications
systems similar to the military's tough portable units, complete with
microwave receivers and solar power arrays.</TE>
<TE>   Refugees would get personal swipe cards. Such a database could be
instrumental in reuniting families, monitoring disease, tracking
criminals and reducing waste and fraud, especially in food rations.</TE>
<TE>   Farfetched? In southern Sudan, German aid workers already are
issuing laminated photo IDs.</TE>
<TE>   Refugees in some countries also might use long-distance phone
service and e-mail. Any system must be self-contained and impervious
to mud and bad weather.</TE>
<TE>   "When you pull it out of the box, it had better have the right
adapter to plug in," warned U.N. telecommunications consultant Mark
Prutsalis, who has worked in the Balkans and Rwanda.</TE>
<TE>   All those computers would need electricity. In Golden, Colo., the
National Renewable Energy Laboratory is testing small solar and wind
power plants in 25 developing nations. They were intended for rural
villages, schools and clinics but could be adapted to camps.</TE>
<TE>   One model was successfully used in a hurricane-relief effort in
Central America.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike with disaster-relief efforts, refugee camps last for
years and become frontier towns. Host countries resist extending
power lines and other infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   "As the camps drag on, renewable energy can play a large role
because it is low-cost and low-maintenance," said Ian Baring-Gould, a
senior engineer for the laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   Cooking and heating are another problem. The United Nations
encourages families to prepare family meals to reinforce cultural
ties and boost morale.</TE>
<TE>   To reduce environmental destruction, the U.N. often delivers
firewood. Scientists suggest switching to small stoves that burn
natural gas, which is easier to come by and cleaner.</TE>
<TE>   To replace charcoal, the Seattle-based Christian relief group
World Concern has developed a lever-operated press to make fuel
briquettes from composted agricultural waste, scrap paper and wood
fibers. The $300 machine is being tested in Haiti, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Solar ovens require no fuel at all. At $229 plus shipping, they
cost less than the briquette maker, but a refugee camp would need one
for every family. That makes them too expensive for agencies that
typically spend $55 a year per refugee.</TE>
<TE>   A crude version made of folded cardboard and aluminum foil is
being tested at the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya. Sacramento-based
Solar Cookers International is distributing the $10 kit to cook stew
in a few hours.</TE>
<TE>   What to cook isn't much of an issue. Refugees survive on starchy
rations. Agriculture experts are experimenting with cardboard boxes
infused with vegetable seeds and fertilizer.</TE>
<TE>   When the supplies are emptied, plant the box and water it. Days
later, veggies sprout.</TE>
<TE>   Some humanitarian experts shake their heads in disbelief at what
they call "James Bond stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Refugees just want to go home, they explain. "And that means
cash," said famine expert Karen Jacobsen of Tufts University in
Boston. "Not fancy technology."</TE>
<TE>   Jacobsen is spearheading a loan program in southern Sudan that
lends Ugandan refugees as little as $50. They might build a fishing
boat or start a crafts trade or buy a foot-powered pump to provide
irrigation. Anything to earn money to buy their passage.</TE>
<TE>   "They're doing whatever they have to do," she said. "How little
people can live on is astounding."</TE>

<HD>Stories of Old N.Y. Told, Bone-by-Bone</HD>
<DH>History: Archeologists piece together portrait of rugged
lives that ended at a turn-of-the-century almshouse. Scurvy and
syphilis were common.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALICIA CHANG</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ALBANY, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>For 100 years, thousands of poor, sick and mentally ill people,
mostly Irish immigrants, sought refuge at one of New York's first
almshouses.</LD>
<LD>   When they died, they were buried in unmarked wooden coffins in a
cemetery on the 216-acre property.</LD>
<LD>   More than 75 years after the Albany County Almshouse shut down,
archeologists are unearthing the history of its people as
construction gets underway on a $60-million biomedical research
laboratory.</LD>
<TE>   Already, a picture has emerged: The majority suffered from dental
disease and infections ranging from scurvy to syphilis. Most of the
men had broken legs, likely from injuries suffered in falls. Women
suffered weakened bones associated with osteoporosis.</TE>
<TE>   "Just about every person had something wrong with them. These
people had a lifetime of stress on them," said assistant project
director Martin Solano of the New York State Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Since February, a team of a dozen archeologists has worked on the
clay-mud site of the original farmhouse and cemetery, located less
than two miles from the governor's mansion and the state Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the site is dotted with the red and blue flags that
indicate where a corpse was found and archeologists carefully remove
soil using wooden trowels, paintbrushes, plastic spoons, even
chopsticks.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to make sure you don't scratch the bones," archeologist
Andrea Lain explained. "Archeology is destructive, so anything we dig
up can never be replicated the same way again."</TE>
<TE>   They have uncovered personal items including fabric, shoes, a
rosary, a hat, a smoking pipe, a religious medal, even a wedding
ring. A cast-iron coffin was also unearthed.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, workers uncovered an adult male skeleton
with several missing ribs and teeth. Who he was, where he came from
and how he died remain a mystery pending further tests.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a fair number of people who were abandoned by whatever
society they were part of," said Mark LoRusso, a historian and
scientist at the State Museum. "What we're seeing is a forgotten
group."</TE>
<TE>   About 271 bodies and 155 body parts have been exhumed so far,
including remains of seven infants. Experts say the chances of
matching individual remains to almshouse records are slim because
graves were unmarked.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't given up the possibility of identifying individuals,"
said archeologist Chuck Fisher. "We're hopeful that there may be some
cases where we can identify the remains."</TE>
<TE>   At least 167 bodies have been taken to a funeral home where they
will be placed in new caskets and buried in marked graves at Albany
Rural Cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   When the Almshouse opened in 1826, it was a safe haven for the
city's beggars, orphans, lunatics and others who took up residence in
the 10-room, two-story brick building, one of a half-dozen structures
that included a farm, hospital and asylum.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists from the State Museum are examining the bones for clues
to the kind of life the poor endured in the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. Historical records show the majority immigrated from
Ireland and other parts of Europe. Blacks also made up the Almshouse
population.</TE>
<TE>   "You can tell these people worked really hard," judging by their
bone structure, Lain said.</TE>
<TE>   The excavation site is behind a World War II-era armory that sits
diagonally across the street from Albany Medical Center. The site is
surrounded by the Albany College of Pharmacy, Albany Law School and
Wadsworth Center, a premier public health laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   The biomedical research lab is being built by the Charitable
Leadership Foundation, a private group based in Clifton Park that is
paying for the reburials. When completed in 2003, the
150,000-square-foot lab will house 350 scientists conducting research
in genomics, pharmacology and regenerative medicine.</TE>
<TE>   The excavation is expected to last until this month. .</TE>
<TE>   From 1880 to 1926, Almshouse records show at least 1,655 people
were buried on the site. The figures don't include the number of
stillborn deaths, bodies that were never buried or the cadavers used
by doctors at Albany Medical College in the 1890s for research
autopsies. They don't include the drowning victims, orphans and
inmates, or railroad and canal workers who died of malaria and other
diseases.</TE>
<TE>   On a typical day, archeologists excavate five skeletal remains.
The bones are cleaned in an on-site lab, then transferred to another
lab for analysis. A full skeleton takes two days to decipher; partial
remains take less time.</TE>
<TE>   Census records show 123 people, including 38 children between 4
months and 8 years, were among the first Almshouse residents. By
1857, the number tripled and living conditions deteriorated. Six to
40 people lived in a single room with poor ventilation.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors were allowed every day except Sunday. Protestants
worshipped in the chapel each Sunday morning; Catholics prayed in the
afternoon. Children were taught reading, writing and arithmetic. Men
tended the fruit and vegetable farm; women were trained in needlework
and knitting.</TE>
<TE>   "There are references that the Almshouse was a desirable place to
go because you could get a couple of nights' rest and food," LoRusso
said. "But in terms of a long-term place to be, I really can't say it
was a great place to live."</TE>
<TE>   Only 100 residents were left when the Almshouse closed in 1926.</TE>

<HD>Wronged by Legal System, He's Making Law a Career</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FOSTER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imprisoned for 10 years for a rape he didn't commit, Anthony Robinson
is uniquely qualified for a career in law.</LD>
<LD>   He enrolled last August at the Thurgood Marshall School of Law at
Texas Southern University, where he quickly became "our celeb
first-year law student," says the dean, John Brittain.</LD>
<LD>   Robinson is surprisingly committed to a legal system that wronged
him, and he has insights that few law students can match, the dean
says.</LD>
<TE>   "They say a person who's been in the joint can tell a guilty
person real quick," Brittain says.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, Robinson was picking up a car for a friend at the
University of Houston when police arrested him, saying he matched the
description that a rape victim had given of her attacker: a black man
with a mustache, wearing a plaid shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson had a plaid shirt but no mustache, but the victim's
identification of him was enough for the jury. He was convicted of
rape in 1987 and sentenced to 27 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Proclaiming his innocence from the start, Robinson could not prove
it until he was paroled in 1997, after a decade behind bars. Then, he
worked day-labor jobs to save up for a lawyer and a $1,800 DNA test.</TE>
<TE>   The test showed his semen did not match evidence collected from
the crime scene, which led the state to conduct its own test, with
the same results. He was pardoned in November 2000 by then-Gov.
George W. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson received $250,000 in compensation from the state, but it
could not restore the lost years. At age 40, the college graduate and
former Army lieutenant is keenly aware of the opportunities that have
passed him by.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of my college classmates have gone on to have children and
careers," he says. "They acquired those things that you do when
you're young and ambitious."</TE>
<TE>   He hopes that a legal career will help him address a disturbing
gap between the theory and practice of law.</TE>
<TE>   "If justice were truly the objective of the prosecution, then how
do things like this occur?" Robinson asks. "The old maxim that 10
guilties should go free rather than one innocent be convicted, does
not drive the prosecutorial mind-set.</TE>
<TE>   "How can it serve the ends of justice when the innocent are
punished and the guilty are allowed to go free? There are some
inconsistencies between what we believe and what we actually do."</TE>

<DH>DNA: Exonerated by new evidence, prisoners find they still
aren't living on easy street.</DH>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Their time in prison surpassed 1,000 years, and all were wrongly
convicted. Then they returned to lives that had passed them by.</LD>
<LD>   An Associated Press examination of what happened to 110 inmates
after their convictions were overturned by DNA tests found that, for
many of the men, vindication brought neither a happy ending nor a
happy beginning.</LD>
<LD>   "It destroyed my family," says Vincent Moto, unjustly convicted of
rape and imprisoned for 10 years in Pennsylvania. "It cost me over
$100,000 to get exonerated. That was my mom and dad's money to
retire. They're struggling. I'm struggling."</LD>
<TE>   Moto, a 39-year-old father of four, says his kids suffered
psychologically and he still has nightmares of prison. He survives on
odd jobs, welfare and food stamps.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to live with these scars all my life," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Danziger is even less fortunate.</TE>
<TE>   Wrongly convicted of rape and sentenced to life in prison, he
suffered permanent brain damage when another inmate bashed in his
head. Danziger was released in 2001 after he served 11 years in
Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Now, at age 31, he lives with his sister, Barbara Oakley.</TE>
<TE>   "He basically gets up, watches TV, goes to the park, and that's
the extent of his day," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Lesly Jean, a 42-year-old former Marine imprisoned in North
Carolina for a rape he did not commit, struggles to rebuild his life.</TE>
<TE>   "You know that old saying, 'When someone knocks you down, you need
to get back up'? Well," he says, "sometimes it's not that simple to
get back up."</TE>
<TE>   That's especially true when the released men find themselves in a
new world where they possess few up-to-date job skills, limited
education, and heavy, if not bitter, hearts. For many, being set free
doesn't mean freedom.</TE>
<TE>   In reviewing the cases of the 110, all men, AP found:</TE>
<TE>   * About half had no prior adult convictions, according to legal
records and the inmates' attorneys. While some were picked up for
questioning because they were known to police, many had never been in
trouble before.</TE>
<TE>   * Eleven of the men served time on death row; two came within days
of execution.</TE>
<TE>   * Slightly more than a third have received compensation, mainly
through state claims. Some have received settlements from civil
lawsuits or special legislation. . For others, claims or suits are
pending; and some had lawsuits thrown out or haven't decided whether
to seek money.</TE>
<TE>   * The men spent 10 years behind bars, on average. The shortest
wrongful incarceration was one year; the longest, 22 years.
Altogether, the 110 men spent 1,149 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   * Their imprisonment came during critical wage-earning years when
careers and families are built. The average age when they entered
prison was 28. At release, it was 38.</TE>
<TE>   * Their convictions follow certain patterns. Nearly two-thirds
were convicted with mistaken testimony from victims and eyewitnesses.
About 14% were imprisoned after mistakes or alleged misconduct by
forensics experts. Nine were mentally retarded or borderline retarded
and confessed, they said, after being tricked or coerced by
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Finally freed--by determined lawyers or their own
perseverance--the men were dumped back into society as abruptly as
they were plucked out. Often, they were not entitled to the help,
such as parole officers, given to those rightfully convicted.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who come out of this are often very, very severely
damaged human beings who often don't ever fully recover," says Rob
Warden, executive director of Northwestern University School of Law's
Center on Wrongful Convictions.</TE>
<TE>   "Lightning strikes, they come out," he says, "and they're in bad,
bad shape."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mostly Black, Latino</TE>
<TE>   They represent many walks of life--a homeless panhandler, a
therapist, a junkie, a mushroom picker, a handyman, a crab fisherman
-- but almost all were working-class or poor.</TE>
<TE>   Of the cases reviewed by AP, about two-thirds involved black or
Latino inmates, roughly reflecting state prison populations' racial
makeup.</TE>
<TE>   "All of these people have a certain vulnerability. It may be race,
class, mental health issues or personality problems," says Peter
Neufeld, who co-founded the Innocence Project with attorney Barry
Scheck at the Cardozo School of Law in New York. About 60% of the men
were helped by the 10-year-old legal assistance program, the rest by
other groups or private lawyers. The first DNA releases came in 1989,
according to the Innocence Project.</TE>
<TE>   "They sort of get caught in this Kafkaesque vortex," Neufeld adds,
"and the rest is history."</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Todd Pierce, for example.</TE>
<TE>   He had never been convicted of a crime when, at age 24, he was
found guilty of rape. Oklahoma City Police Department chemist Joyce
Gilchrist testified that hair found at the scene matched Pierce's, an
analysis the FBI would conclude--15 years later--was just plain
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce's wife divorced him and his twin sons, now 16, grew up
without him. After Pierce was released last year, he reunited with
his family in Michigan, though he can't bring himself to remarry.</TE>
<TE>   "Prison made me look after myself, and I don't want to commit to
anything that can be taken away from me at an instant," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Or consider David Vasquez of Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   The 55-year-old man was mistakenly identified by a witness who
said he was lurking outside the home of a woman later found raped and
murdered.</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez, who is borderline retarded, confessed. Four years after
his conviction, DNA testing identified the real killer, a serial
rapist.</TE>
<TE>   "They destroyed his life and mine," says Vasquez's mother, Imelda
Shapiro. "My life stopped in 1984. My son and I just sit in this
house."</TE>
<TE>   Shapiro begins to weep. "We can't afford to go out, and I'm afraid
to go out." Her son bags groceries part time.</TE>
<TE>   "That's about as much as he can handle," she says. They live on
his wages and $825 a month she secured through a special dispensation
from the state.</TE>
<TE>   For many exonerated men, reentering society is baffling. There are
so many changes--PIN codes, the Internet, wireless communication.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything was a lot faster than it was when I went in," says
Ronnie Bullock, 46, who spent a decade in an Illinois prison before
being cleared of rape in 1994. "Pagers, cell phones, camcorders--even
going to the grocery stores was different."</TE>
<TE>   So, too, was freedom.</TE>
<TE>   After Kevin Green was released, he bought a cell phone and a pager
so his family could keep track of him at every moment--just to allay
their fears.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Fain struggled to stop pacing five steps forward, then
five steps back--the dimensions of his cell.</TE>
<TE>   A team of AP reporters identified 110 cases through late May in
which convictions were overturned because of DNA testing. Many other
cases were pending.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the 110 men had been convicted of rape, 24 were found
guilty of rape and murder, six of murder only. In criminal cases, the
evidence most often tested for genetic identification is bodily
fluids, which explains the high number of rape convictions
overturned.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts differ on who these men represent.</TE>
<TE>   Tip of the Iceberg</TE>
<TE>   Neufeld says they're the tip of the iceberg.</TE>
<TE>   From the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, before state and local
police had their own labs for DNA testing, they sent the evidence to
the FBI for analysis, he says. The results? The prime suspect turned
out not to be a match in about 2,000 of 8,000 cases where there was
enough material for testing, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Errors that lead to wrongful convictions also occur in cases where
there's no DNA to test, he says. "Is there any reason that a witness
would be less likely to be mistaken in a robbery than a rape?</TE>
<TE>   "What this does tell you is we're not talking about a handful of
innocent people" in prison, he adds. "We're clearly talking about
thousands."</TE>
<TE>   Historically, of course, convictions have been overturned for many
reasons, not just genetic testing. In fact, 11 people exonerated
through the Innocence Project Northwest in Seattle had cases that did
not turn on DNA results.</TE>
<TE>   Errors Less Likely</TE>
<TE>   But John Wilson, who heads a state crime lab in Missouri and has
testified as a DNA expert in criminal trials, doubts Neufeld's point.
He also says more widely available DNA testing has made wrongful
convictions less likely in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is, the majority of the time, the cops are right. It is
the right guy," Wilson says.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the men whose cases AP looked into had criminal pasts--no
fewer than seven had prior convictions for sex crimes. In addition,
11 who were freed have been convicted of new crimes and nine of those
have been sentenced to prison.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry Kotler was exonerated of rape in 1992 in New York. Five
years later, he was convicted of sexual assault. This time, DNA
helped convict him.</TE>
<TE>   Though genetic testing helped Albert Wesley Brown win release from
an Oklahoma prison last year, he now admits he was guilty of the
murder of a 67-year-old man.</TE>
<TE>   A crime-scene hair sample that had been used as evidence against
him at trial wasn't his, a DNA test later showed. But as prosecutors
prepared to retry him without this mistaken evidence, he pleaded
guilty.</TE>
<TE>   "I took him to the lake and drowned him and left him," Brown said
in court last month. The plea was in exchange for a sentence of time
served, 18 years.</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the spectrum, some of the freed men have been
remarkably successful.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Bravo recently graduated with honors from a California law
school and plans to start a foundation for people who get caught up
in similar predicaments. Anthony Robinson just finished his first
year as a law student in Texas. Timothy Durham helps run his family's
electronics store in Oklahoma. Edward Honaker has published two
novels--both written in a Virginia prison.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about it is, you can't let your incarceration defeat
you," Honaker says. "And you can't let it dictate the rest of your
life."</TE>
<TE>   Death has claimed four of the men. Two died of cancer, one while
in prison, and the other six months after his release.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Callace of New York died from a heroin overdose four years
after he was freed. "When he got out, he was never able to put it in
back of him," said his brother, Pierre Callace.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Waters enjoyed freedom for just a matter of months.</TE>
<TE>   His sister, Betty Anne, had only a high school equivalency diploma
but put herself through law school to help win his release. In March
2001, after 18 years behind bars for a murder and armed robbery he
hadn't committed, Waters was released. He had contracted hepatitis C
in prison, apparently from dental work. But that did not kill him.</TE>
<TE>   Last September while taking a shortcut to his brother's
Massachusetts home, Waters fell from a 15-foot wall. He fractured his
skull and died.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard," Betty Anne Waters said at the time. "But we look at
it as six months of freedom is better than 20 years in jail."</TE>
<TE>   The pace of exonerations is quickening, keeping up with the
availability of genetic testing. The Innocence Project reported 23
men were cleared last year by DNA, compared with six in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   That increase has prompted much legislation giving inmates access
to DNA testing to challenge their convictions. Twenty-five states now
have such laws, all but two passed in the last three years, says Nina
Morrison, the Innocence Project's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   But some new laws have restrictions that she considers
unreasonable--such as a one-year period for inmates to seek DNA
testing. That's not enough time to assemble a case, she says.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the number of inmates begging for genetic analysis
grows. The Innocence Project says it has 4,000 cases at some stage of
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest problem, Neufeld says, is the race against time.</TE>
<TE>   In three-quarters of the Innocence Project's cases, physical
evidence such as hair or blood has been lost, misplaced or destroyed.
During a criminal trial, the disappearance of evidence can mean
acquittal. After conviction, it can mean losing all chances to prove
one's innocence.</TE>
<TE>   When lawyers for Marvin Anderson wanted DNA analysis in 1993, they
were told the evidence had been destroyed. But a swab of genetic
material was later found, taped to a lab technician's notebook.</TE>
<TE>   It proved Anderson was not guilty--though not everyone was
convinced.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people look at me like I'm guilty," he says. "It's hard
finding a job. No one hires a person convicted of rape."</TE>
<TE>   Five years after his exoneration, Anderson is a trucker, scraping
by on $200 to $400 a week.</TE>
<TE>   He faces the hardest task of the men able to work--earning a
living wage. Others say they cannot work because of post-traumatic
stress syndrome, depression or physical handicaps.</TE>
<TE>   If "all that's on your resume is a blank, or state prison for the
last 10, 15 years, there's not exactly a bunch of people out there
willing to hire you for other than minimum-wage jobs," says Randy
Schaffer, a Houston lawyer who represented three exonerated men.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Toney, a shuttle bus driver in Missouri, earns slightly
more than minimum wage. He says he has struggled to get beyond menial
jobs, but suspects his past has been held against him by prospective
employers.</TE>
<TE>   "How many are going to come out and say, 'I'm not hiring you
because you were incarcerated'?" he asks. "But I don't get the call."</TE>
<TE>   When Eduardo Velazquez, 35, looks for work, he carries a newspaper
photo of himself taken the day of his release. After 13 years in a
Massachusetts prison, he wants to prove he did nothing wrong. Still,
he says, no one will hire him.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Williamson came within five days of being executed for a
murder and rape. After 11 years in prison, his bipolar disease
degenerated to hearing voices and psychotic episodes. Today, the
former minor-league ballplayer's best chance for a job is an
application he submitted to a cafeteria.</TE>
<TE>   The families of these men also suffer.</TE>
<TE>   Moto, the Pennsylvania man, recalls how his children would grab
his legs as they ended their prison visits and plead to the guards,
'''Let my daddy go!'''</TE>
<TE>   Some families remain together; others are ripped apart.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Linscott was convicted of murdering a young woman in
suburban Chicago. Then a college Bible student managing a Christian
halfway house with his wife, he told police about a strange dream he
had, which in some ways was similar to the attack.</TE>
<TE>   The police considered it a confession. He ended up going to prison
for more than three years.</TE>
<TE>   Linscott's wife and children moved to southern Illinois, near the
penitentiary, and waited for him. Now a therapist for emotionally
disturbed children, he is working on his second master's degree.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Salazar was married to his childhood sweetheart, Christina.
After four years of bringing their three children to a Texas prison
visiting room, she couldn't cope anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar couldn't stand to see her suffer. "I told her, 'You do
what you have to do.' And she went on with her life. She filed for
divorce. It was hard for me to say that.... We grew up together."</TE>
<TE>   Now 36, he is engaged to someone else.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Wardell, 37, has a wife, a 2-year-old daughter, a house and
a job as a machinist--every single thing he dreamed of during 11
years in an Illinois prison. And yet something is missing.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a big gap that makes me wonder ... all the things I could
have been and could have done," he said. "Now there's just a big
piece of time that's gone."</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Cotton Jr. faces the future by looking, unflinchingly, at
his past.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Thompson is the rape victim whose mistaken identification
put him in prison for 10 years. He has become her friend. Together,
they give speeches.</TE>
<TE>   She lobbied to change laws so Cotton would be entitled to more
than the $5,000 North Carolina originally offered as compensation. He
received nearly $110,000.</TE>
<TE>   After becoming a free man in 1995, Cotton bought some land, got
married, fathered a child and found work as a machine operator.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he is haunted.</TE>
<TE>   "I know if it happened once," he says, "it can happen again."</TE>

<HD>Hiroshima's Legacy: A Game to Play for Peace</HD>
<DH>Culture: Kaoru Iwamoto began a campaign to foster better
relations after the World War II bombing interrupted his title match
in the ancient game of Go.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LUIS CABRERA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Kaoru Iwamoto, one of the greatest professional players of the
ancient board game Go, lost the most important match of his career.</LD>
<LD>   The title match, being played seven miles outside Hiroshima on
Aug. 6, 1945, was halted amid shattered windows in the blast of the
atomic bomb.</LD>
<LD>   Unaware of the chaos nearby, players resumed their game and
Iwamoto went on to lose, even as streams of horrifically injured
refugees filed out of the city. What he saw later that evening
affected the Go master so deeply that he eventually gave up his
professional career and became a unique ambassador for the
3,000-year-old game, using it to try to bring together people of
different cultures.</LD>
<TE>   "He dedicated his life to promoting peace in the way that made
sense for him, which was to teach people to play Go," said Chris
Kirschner, vice president of the board of the Seattle Go Center. The
Seattle facility, and another center in New York, were founded by the
late Go master.</TE>
<TE>   "The last time I saw him, he was here in 1996 for our third
anniversary, and he was 96 then," Kirschner said. "He was very happy
to see what we had here, because he saw all people playing together:
Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Caucasians."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Tuesday night--beginner's night--a rotating but steady
crowd of about 15 players of various ethnicities matched wits at the
center's dozen Go boards while Kirschner, center manager Jon Boley
and other advanced players offered advice.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw people play this in China, and I never tried it," said Roo
Lee-Wright, a native of Shanghai who works as a medical records
clerk.</TE>
<TE>   This was her first visit to the center, which serves as an
occasional meeting place for the mostly on-again, off-again Go clubs
in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "I really like it," she said of the game. "It's like a practice of
wisdom. You have to think to get better. It's really good practice
for your brain."</TE>
<TE>   Go originated in China and is wildly popular in Japan, where
tournament games are broadcast on weekend TV. In South Korea, a
24-hour Go channel offers games, news and tutorials.</TE>
<TE>   The full-sized Go board, or playing field, has 19 vertical and 19
horizontal lines. Polished black or white stones are placed on the
intersections of lines, called points. The aim of the game is to
capture territory, or surround more points of territory than your
opponent, and in the process capture your opponent's stones.</TE>
<TE>   The stones are placed on the points, and a stone is captured when
all the points around it are taken by the opponent's stones.</TE>
<TE>   Akira Sato, 68, an architect who moved to the United States from
Japan in 1963, said he recently began playing Go after a hiatus of
nearly 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a fascinating exercise," he said. "At the beginning of
the game, it's kind of a design process. You come up with a strategy,
a scheme--sometimes successful, sometimes not. You try to maintain
that original design scheme."</TE>
<TE>   Players of any age and skill level can enjoy the game, but skill
and strategy will determine the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   At a corner table, Cheng Choi, 70, sat studying advanced Go
strategy in an instruction book. Luke Allen, 8, who is in elementary
school, floated around the room, facing off with various adult
players.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Deborah Niedermeyer, said she was drawn to the center
by its vibrant cultural mix as well as its mission.</TE>
<TE>   Luke likes the fight for position that takes place on the board.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Go's martial connections are much more subtle than those
of chess.</TE>
<TE>   "Chess is a really good game, but this is larger scale and more
interesting," said Rick Hubbell, a volunteer instructor at the
center. "There's more strategic potential in Go."</TE>
<TE>   Boley does regular outreach to elementary schools, teaching basic
Go strategies to classes.</TE>
<TE>   "What we really try to do to make it work is find an individual in
the school who is willing to run a Go club," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Go Center has had difficulty attracting younger
players because of a relative lack of schools around it, manager Tom
Tracey said.</TE>
<TE>   For that center, Iwamoto bought a four-story brownstone on East
52nd Street. Tracey said the center's proximity to the thousands of
workers at the United Nations building has helped it attract adult
players. Even so, the center struggles to draw a diverse group of
regulars.</TE>
<TE>   "About half are Japanese and maybe a quarter are Jewish," he said.
"We're trying, but that's the way it's been for 30 years" in area
clubs.</TE>
<TE>   The Seattle Go Center also owns its own building, an unassuming
two-story structure on a busy street about a mile from the University
of Washington in north Seattle. A bronze bust of Iwamoto greets
visitors as they ascend the inside stairs.</TE>
<TE>   Outside is a more subtle tribute: an oversized Go board that
serves as the center's sign. On it, black and white stones are placed
in the exact pattern that had emerged in Iwamoto's title game, just
before the Hiroshima blast.</TE>

<HD>Head of Hispanic Center Wants It on Everybody's Must-See
List</HD>
<DH>New Mexico: Tom Chavez is determined to raise the profile
of the $55-million complex and make it the place for Latino arts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE MAJOR HOLMES</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.</DL>
<LD>Tom Chavez is ready to be chief lobbyist, fund-raiser and promoter of
the National Hispanic Cultural Center to make it the place you've got
to see.</LD>
<LD>   In six weeks as director, he has brought his not-inconsiderable
experience with the Museum of New Mexico system to the $55-million
center in Albuquerque, which has had fewer visitors than projected
since opening in October 2000.</LD>
<LD>   "Right now if you drive by you wouldn't know there's anything
here," Chavez said.</LD>
<TE>   Chavez wants everyone to come--not just Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   "You guys are Hispanic whether it's in your blood or you just eat
burritos for breakfast.... This institute is everyone's," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez had been with the state history museum, the Palace of the
Governors in Santa Fe, for more than two decades when he announced
his retirement last year. Offers started coming in, but figuring it
was too early to decide, Chavez went off to Spain.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to a full campaign to recruit him, led by the state
cultural affairs secretary and by Ed Lujan, chairman of the center's
board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   "I had been wishing we could get Tom for a long time," Lujan said.
"I'm just so excited that he's there; it's a dream come true."</TE>
<TE>   Latino influence in New Mexico dates from the arrival of Spanish
conquistadors in 1598. Forty percent of today's population, 650,000
people, are Latino. Chavez, who traces his family here back to 1601,
was a good fit, said Tom Livesay, who headed New Mexico's museum
system for 14 years before leaving in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "He's dynamic, he works well with people and should see the
cultural center moving into a really new place in the hearts and
minds of people of New Mexico," Livesay said. "If anybody can do it,
Tom can."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, who took over April 1, said New Mexicans don't get to see
what's going on in Latino arts elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   He jumps up from the four-seat conference table in his office to
point out steel girders rising outside his second-story window. The
performing arts center will open in September 2003 with a 300-seat
film and video theater and a 730-seat arts theater, able to stage
everything from lectures to music to plays.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez would like to bring theater performances and festivals from
throughout the Latino world--a major one each year.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no limit.... We can do almost anything," Chavez said.</TE>
<TE>   The performing arts center will have a television station to
record performances and produce Latino-related programsHe also wants
tourism groups to put the center and Albuquerque on the must-see
list. Although plays, movies and other events in the center's 93-seat
lecture hall regularly draw overflow crowds, its art galleries see
only scattered visitors on weekdays.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some kind of mental makeup in Albuquerque that you've got
to go to Santa Fe to see art and if it's in Albuquerque it's not up
to snuff," Chavez said. "Well, I disagree with that one.... If you're
here for art and culture, we've got some things in Albuquerque that
Santa Fe doesn't have."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the 22-acre property will have an education building
with classrooms and a kitchen to teach preparation of traditional
dishes. Chavez also wants trails on the center's property along the
adjacent Rio Grande bosque.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, Chavez said, about half the budget comes from the state,
up to 10% from ticket sales and the rest from an endowment or
fund-raising for specific programs. Right now, the center turns to
the Hispanic Culture Foundation for needs outside the basic budget.</TE>
<TE>   He jokes about the fund-raising aspects of his job--"It's called
groveling"--before turning serious.</TE>
<TE>   "If the director isn't going to be the chief fund-raiser, then
you're not going have the staff engaged, and if they see the staff's
not engaged you're not going to get the funds.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no problem going out and begging for this place at all."</TE>

<HD>Kidney Patient Renews Life With a Newspaper Ad</HD>
<DH>Health: Desperate man searches for his own donor and finds
a perfect match. Altruistic person says he wasn't using the organ, so
he gave it away.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN DOBBIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS Writer</BD>
<DL>ROCHESTER, N.Y.(AP)</DL>
<LD>ROCHESTER, N.Y.--Steve Aman believes that if you have something you
aren't using, you should give it away.</LD>
<LD>   So he gave a complete stranger one of his kidneys.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't need two," Aman said. "He needed one."</LD>
<TE>   His kidney went to Pete Dobrovitz. The two of them attended the
same Catholic high school in the 1960s, but they never knew each
other.</TE>
<TE>   Dobrovitz, 49, a former television news announcer, had waited 19
years for a successful transplant. Twice, kidneys from cadavers had
failed him.</TE>
<TE>   A kidney from a living donor seemed his only salvation. With a
healthy donor, doctors could schedule the operation. Dobrovitz could
take anti-rejection medicine ahead of time and make sure he was in
the best physical shape for the transplant.</TE>
<TE>   The organ itself would be vital and healthy. During his previous
transplants, both donor kidneys went into shock and took more than a
day to start working.</TE>
<TE>   In desperation, he placed a $60 classified ad in June: "WANTED:
Your Spare Kidney."</TE>
<TE>   Within a week, a dozen people came forward. One wanted $10,000.
Another talked giddily of daily church visits to "pray for this
miracle." Some just hadn't thought their offer through. Dobrovitz's
own screening narrowed the donors to four.</TE>
<TE>   During testing, the first man discovered he had early signs of
cancer. The second was Aman. Even while advances in anti-rejection
drugs make genetic matching less relevant, he was an ideal match.
"One in 10 million," the doctor said.</TE>
<TE>   More important, though, Aman was acting on what seemed like the
right impulses.</TE>
<TE>   A recovering alcoholic, he had joined a self-help group after
getting sober a decade ago and became friends with a Tuscarora Indian
who helped transform his views on life.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the Native [American] nations have this philosophy that
if you don't use something, you should give it away," said Aman,
whose wife, Mary, is part Mohawk.</TE>
<TE>   Taking a break from springtime chores at his tree nursery east of
Rochester, Aman said he regarded kidney donation as merely the "next
step," and not a very risky one, in a journey of personal discovery.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really proud of him," Mary Aman said. "I think what he did
was the most generous thing one human being can do for another."</TE>
<TE>   More than 52,000 Americans are signed up for a kidney transplant.
Every day, eight of them die waiting.</TE>
<TE>   While the number of kidneys from dead donors has leveled off at
around 8,000 a year, more sophisticated drugs and less invasive
surgical methods doubled annual transplants involving living donors
between 1994 and 2001, when 5,944 were performed, according to the
United Network for Organ Sharing. Of those, 1,368 donors are not
blood relatives of the organ recipients. That figure is a six-fold
increase from 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 26 people donated kidneys anonymously, with no
recipient specified.</TE>
<TE>   A rarer cluster that also shows promise of expanding is random
donors steering a kidney to someone soliciting help through media
channels, notably the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Transplantation regulators who use medical and psychiatric tests
to screen donors find the job trickier in the absence of a genetic or
emotional link. They also worry that unorthodox methods for getting
off the waiting list might give some an unfair advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "Our knee-jerk reaction is, is this person a saint or a
psychopath?" said Dr. Mark Fox of the University of Rochester, who is
chairman of the ethics committee of the kidney-sharing network in
Richmond, Va. "Motivation is very hard to really get at, so the best
we can do is identify those things we consider unacceptable and
exclude those people.</TE>
<TE>   "Very often we get a sense from prospective donors that somehow
this is going to atone for their sins. On the other hand, we've had
people that said, 'I've volunteered all my life. I've given 25
gallons of blood. I work for Meals on Wheels,' and this is just an
extension of the behavior pattern they've established all along."</TE>
<TE>   While it's illegal in the United States to sell or pay for an
organ, Fox fears that people with more money, media savvy or even
better looks might jump the queue by launching a marketing campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few medical centers accept anonymous organ donations. The
Washington Regional Transplant Consortium in Falls Church, Va., has
had more than 100 inquiries from people willing to donate a kidney.
So far, 11 have resulted in transplants.</TE>
<TE>   "We're always looking at ways to find more organs and this is just
one," spokeswoman Toni Webb said. "Most people say it was an easy
thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Born with kidney ailments, Dobrovitz had his first transplant in
1983. The kidney stopped functioning 18 months later; dialysis three
times a week kept him alive. Another kidney transplanted in 1987 gave
out in 1995. Back to dialysis. Doctors told him a third cadaver
kidney held little promise.</TE>
<TE>   Aman, 50, had been thinking of donating a kidney for a year before
reading a news article about Dobrovitz's ad. One detail caught his
eye--Dobrovitz runs Rochester's Big Brothers-Big Sisters chapter, a
child-mentoring program where Aman had once volunteered.</TE>
<TE>   Aman's medical costs for the surgery were paid for by Medicare and
Dobrovitz's health insurance. Four tiny incisions in Aman's abdomen
are the only traces from the January operation. His sole kidney has
grown bigger to make up for the other's absence. Anesthesia left him
nauseous for a few days, but he was back lugging saplings within a
month.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had to distill it down to one single reason, it's so that
somebody else could have a better life," he said. "If I was going to
be debilitated 10 years down the road because of this, then I
wouldn't have done it. I'm not a martyr."</TE>
<TE>   He and Dobrovitz are pushing to create a blind national registry
of living donors. Recent studies show the median survival rate of
living-kidney recipients is more than 20 years versus 13 years for
cadaver-kidney recipients, according to the National Kidney
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Dobrovitz is free of dialysis' quiet hell and its awful
side effects: a heart attack, hearing loss, gall bladder surgery,
aching joints, yellowing skin. For seven years, it kept him from
traveling very far from home.</TE>
<TE>   "Every place I go now, Steve gets a postcard," he said. His energy
level has soared. He walks more upright, his shoulders squared, his
complexion less peaked. This transplant has given him "the best
chance of long-term survival."</TE>
<TE>   What Aman did cannot be measured.</TE>
<TE>   "It's changed my life, no question," Dobrovitz said. "Thank you
just doesn't cut it."</TE>

<HD>Bowling Alley Strikes Out</HD>
<DH>Education: The L.A. school district will build 26
classrooms on the site occupied by Hollywood Star Lanes, which will
close in August.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was another busy night at the Hollywood Star Lanes and try as he
might, 69-year-old Johann Schuessler couldn't keep up with his wife,
Aldona, 57. She's the bowler in the family.</LD>
<LD>   In the next lane, Bill Kingsbury, Lee Denton and Cletus Young were
enjoying yet another Saturday outing, knocking over the pins and
laughing at one another's jokes.</LD>
<LD>   Also in the crowd was 26-year-old Ben Cutter, who suddenly became
a center of attention for bowling an almost unheard-of--at least in
this crowd--game of 200.</LD>
<TE>   "If I could ever do this again," Cutter muttered, admitting he
usually shoots half that score.</TE>
<TE>   But overriding the scene was the knowledge that the fun at the
Hollywood Star Lanes is coming to an end.</TE>
<TE>   The landmark bowling alley, established in 1960, is scheduled to
close Aug. 7, the result of an eminent domain proceeding by the Los
Angeles Unified School District to take over the 3-acre parcel where
the bowling alley sits along Santa Monica Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with an expanding enrollment that threatens to surpass
748,000 students next fall, the administrators of the nation's
second-largest school district have started a new facilities program
to relieve overcrowded conditions at many of their campuses. They
believe the new building program, especially focused in the densely
congested area in the city's central district stretching north from
Wilshire Boulevard to east Hollywood, can relieve the overcrowding.</TE>
<TE>   District officials say that as many as 158 separate construction
projects are scheduled to deal with the growing enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   At Ramona Elementary School, about three blocks from Star Lanes,
1,200 students are enrolled at the small campus; about 300 others
take buses to as far away as the San Fernando Valley because there is
no room for more.</TE>
<TE>   Officials plan to tear down the bowling alley and build 26 new
classrooms to augment the space at Ramona.</TE>
<TE>   For several years, district officials have talked with Sam
Barnese, Star Lanes' owner, about acquiring the property, but no
agreement has been reached. District officials and Barnese wouldn't
say how much money was offered during the negotiations. In a recent
interview at the bowling alley, Barnese acknowledged that the
district made a "seven-figure" offer but refused to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   At the 32-lane bowling alley, none of the regulars was against
education or the idea of new classrooms at Ramona. Nevertheless, they
were upset that a favorite hangout, where a movie star is
occasionally sighted, must close.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's reprehensible," said Young, 67, a regular who admits
to an average of 165. "I taught my daughter how to bowl here. I
didn't even know it was closing. My daughter sent me an e-mail [about
it] from the East Coast."</TE>
<TE>   "I think it stinks," chimed in Aldona Schuessler. "They don't need
this place for a school."</TE>
<TE>   The Star Lanes, where numerous movies, including "The Big
Lebowsky," were filmed, is a throwback to an era when bowling alleys
were plentiful and games were scored with pencils. Only in recent
years was electronic scoring introduced at Star Lanes, thanks in part
to profits from the Coen brothers film.</TE>
<TE>   What peeves many at Star Lanes is the apparent contradiction of
abolishing a popular gathering place for families and young
people--especially since the number of bowling alleys in Greater Los
Angeles is dwindling--in order to build more classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "This just isn't another bowling alley," said Star Lanes waitress
Antonella  Cannalire , who hails from northern Italy. "There are very
few places like this, where actors, young people, families, people
from Australia [and] New Zealand can get together."</TE>
<TE>   While Barnese seems resigned that the bowling alley will close,
other employees are fighting to keep it open.</TE>
<TE>   Waitress Ziggy Kruse, who is from Hamburg, Germany, says her
petition drive to save Star Lanes has so far netted more than 3,000
signatures. She and others have set up an e-mail address,
savehsl@aol.com, to garner support.</TE>
<TE>   Kruse said she and other supporters recently met with Los Angeles
City Councilman Eric Garcetti, who represents the area, to press
their case. Their persistence has paid off--they'll have a
face-to-face meeting, scheduled for Monday, in Garcetti's office with
Los Angeles School Board President Caprice Young.</TE>
<TE>   According to district officials, however, the effort to save the
bowling alley might be too little, too late.</TE>
<TE>   Young, who represents the area, says school district officials
used a site-selection process that included representatives from
community-based organizations and parents who have children at
Ramona. "There was a consensus about this site," she said, noting
that there were few complaints about the decision to acquire the
property.</TE>
<TE>   Only now, she says, has opposition surfaced because the district
has initiated eminent domain proceedings--the procedure by which a
government agency can take over private property if an owner refuses
to sell.</TE>
<TE>   "I've gotten 30 to 40 calls about this and I completely understand
because I'm a bowling widow," says Young, whose husband has a 200
average. "I would rather not take the bowling alley, but that area is
that squeezed in [by surging enrollment]."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the price, another area of disagreement between the
district officials and Barnese is their refusal to buy additional
property he owns next door to the bowling alley.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need it," explained Mort Bernstein, a real-estate
consultant who is handling the district's acquisition of the
property. Bernstein said the bowling alley and the large parking lot
behind it will serve the district's needs.</TE>
<TE>   On the recent Saturday night, patrons mostly growled their
displeasure at the school district's plans.</TE>
<TE>   Only Cutter, the young hipster who bowled a 200 game earlier,
seemed to understand the dilemma facing the district.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a liberal Democrat and I believe in education," he said. "I
would hate to see this place go, but I didn't sign the petition. My
friends signed, but I didn't."</TE>

<HD>Day the Earth Shook Violently in Tehachapi</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CECILIA RASMUSSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clocks stopped at 4:52 a.m. on Monday, July 21, 1952, in the small
railroad town of Tehachapi, nestled in the mountain range separating
two Californias. The earth shivered an hour before dawn, when the
summer sun would rise over Walker Pass like a burning ball to sear
the Mojave.</LD>
<LD>   The epicenter of the rolling temblor measured 7.7 on the Richter
scale and centered on White Wolf Fault southwest of Bakersfield. It
was the most powerful  earthquake to hit Southern California in the
20th century and the largest in the nation since San Francisco's in
1906.</LD>
<LD>   Pat Gracey, then 23, was living with her mother in a
70-year-old-home when six subsequent jolts, some as big as magnitude
5, followed within moments and hours.</LD>
<TE>   "The aftershocks felt and sounded like galloping horses right
there in the house," Gracey, now 73, said in a recent interview. She
still lives in town, and her niece lives in that very house.</TE>
<TE>   Screams and children's cries came from a toppled two-story
unreinforced brick building across the street from Gracey's home. One
adult and eight children died there, tearing at the heart of the
town. The earth shook so convulsively that a nearby yellow school bus
bounced in the air like a rubber ball.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the Red Cross and other rescue workers, more than a
dozen long-robed members of the WKFL Fountain of the World--the
Wisdom, Knowledge, Faith and Love cult in Ventura County--braved the
aftershocks to bandage the injured and feed the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Awakened by the temblor and plaster falling from his bedroom
ceiling, Police Chief Hugh Ernst dressed and went into the streets to
assess the damage. In a town with fewer than 2,000 residents, the
toll was frightening: 12 people dead and 35 injured, some critically.</TE>
<TE>   Ernst's fear--along with that of most townsfolk--was what might
have happened at the California Institution for Women, south of town.
At the time, it was the state's only prison for female felons, with
more than 417 inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Seventy guards ushered the sleepy convicts out of the wreckage
without incident. The women spent a day on the lawns in front of the
warden's Tudor-style mansion as members of the military pitched tents
to shelter them for several weeks. Eventually, they were moved to a
newly constructed prison at Frontera, near Chino. Gov. Earl Warren
issued each woman a "good conduct" reward, entitling her to subtract
one month from her sentence.</TE>
<TE>   The railroad, the town's reason for existence and once one of its
largest employers, didn't get off as easily.</TE>
<TE>   Two tunnels with 18-inch-thick walls collapsed east of town,
blocking all train travel for days. Railroad inspectors said that an
eight-mile section of the tracks was "twisted like a licorice stick"
and a 30-foot chasm yawned in the right-of-way. The Southern Pacific
Railroad's water tank bounced off its 15-foot perch, crushing and
flooding the home of railroad worker Woodrow Newton and his family,
who barely escaped.</TE>
<TE>   Police officer Kirby Bezzo was putting up a pedestrian crosswalk
sign near Gracey's house when he saw his patrol car slide more than
70 feet across the intersection.</TE>
<TE>   Then he heard the blood-curdling screams of Louis G. Martin: "Help
me, help me!" Martin's red-brick, two-story furniture store had
collapsed atop his one-story attached apartment, where his family
slept. Another one-story house, where 16 people lived, also was
crushed. For four hours, neighbors, friends and rescue workers dug
through the three collapsed structures with shovels, hammers,
pocketknives and bare hands. All the while, they listened to the
anguished cries of the buried children. Three of Martin's children,
along with one of his children's friends, were found dead in the
rubble.</TE>
<TE>   Martin's neighbor, Pete Quintana, 40, and his oldest daughter,
Ruth, 17, managed to crawl out. They huddled together near the
wreckage, looking for a sign that the rest of the family would
somehow emerge from the mountain of brick and timber. Quintana's
wife, Blanche, 36, and their nine children had just arrived the day
before from New Mexico, ready to begin a new life in Tehachapi.</TE>
<TE>   One of the children pinned in the rubble worried more about the
rescuers than herself. "Watch out, men, don't get hurt. Because I'm
hurt, don't get hurt yourself," she cautioned.</TE>
<TE>   Four of Quintana's children and two other relatives finally were
freed. But before rescuers could reach his wife, who was crushed to
death under a wooden beam, the last faint cries of one of the
children faded into nothing. Soon, the four remaining children, some
still breathing, were found together in the same bed. Those who were
still alive then died soon after from injuries and dust-filled
lungs.Quintana's brother-in-law escaped injury by leaving the house
moments earlier to get a cup of coffee at a nearby cafe. But another
brother-in-law wasn't so lucky. He was injured when a flying brick
hit him in the head as he slept under a nearby tree.</TE>
<TE>   In Cummings Valley, about 12 miles west of Tehachapi, 16-year-old
Florence Fillmore, a student at Immaculate Heart High School in Los
Angeles, was crushed to death when the walls and roof of a
100-year-old guest house crumbled. Florence, a descendant of Millard
Fillmore, the 13th president of the United States, had served as maid
of honor at the wedding of her sister, Sophia, before the quake
wreaked havoc on the family and wedding guests. Others sleeping in
the same room escaped harm. A plaque in Florence's memory is attached
to the Sacred Heart of Jesus statue at St. Malachy Church in
Tehachapi.</TE>
<TE>   The 45-second temblor claimed two other victims: Walter Nolan, who
was scheduled to open his new shoe-repair shop that morning, was hit
by a falling beam in the Summit Hotel. And Ramon Tescador, who lived
over the hill in the town of Arvin, died when he opened his
gas-powered refrigerator, which exploded.</TE>
<TE>   The road into town, California 58, buckled, cracked and wrinkled,
making transportation difficult. The quake triggered landslides in
the canyons and set oil refineries ablaze near Bakersfield, Newhall
and even Long Beach, about 100 miles south of the epicenter.</TE>
<TE>   Brick and adobe buildings were hit hard by the temblor, which
damaged or destroyed 75 homes and 25 businesses. The Tehachapi
Hospital was badly damaged and later torn down. Landmarks such as the
1907 Masonic Temple, the Juanita and Summit hotels and the Tehachapi
Inn all collapsed. In all, the quake inflicted $60 million in damages
in today's dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "The thrust of the Tehachapi earthquake was equal to 1,000
billion-horsepower engines running for one hour," Caltech
seismologist John M. Norquist said.</TE>
<TE>   Within two months after the quake, Caltech had recorded 188
aftershocks of magnitude 4.0 and higher.</TE>
<TE>   Shock waves were felt throughout the state and in western parts of
Arizona and Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Structural engineers and university researchers learned  little
from the Tehachapi earthquake because there were no seismic measuring
instruments that far out. There are now.Tehachapi set about
rebuilding, christening itself the land of four seasons to highlight
its snowy winters and mild summers. Now, the town has a population of
more than 11,000 and the Tehachapi Museum, where visitors can view
photographs and a film of the 1952 earthquake.</TE>

<HD>Ignoring a Simple Fact in Utah: Deserts Are Supposed to Be
Dry</HD>
<DH>Environment: The wisdom of farming arid land is under
scrutiny, where much of the state gets less than 10 inches of water a
year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATTY HENETZ</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Farmers and politicians call Utah's fourth straight year of
below-average snowpack a disaster. But a University of Utah political
science professor who writes on Western water issues says that
ignores a simple fact: Deserts are supposed to be dry.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a mistake to talk about the drought as a crisis," said Dan
McCool. "We are always in a drought. That's the definition of a
desert. It's ignoring that Utah is a desert that's causing the
problem."</LD>
<LD>   McCool isn't alone in his thinking. Volumes have been written
criticizing the West's water subsidies that began with the 1902
creation of the Reclamation Act, which guaranteed water for Western
farmers and ranchers no matter the cost. But the practice continues:
82% of Utah's water goes to an industry that accounts for 1% of the
state's economy.</LD>
<TE>   This year's water shortages are focusing new attention on those
figures and the wisdom of farming in the desert. The drought means
farm water cutbacks of 50% in northern Utah, and as much as 100% in
the southern desert.</TE>
<TE>   Although Salt Lake City, with an average annual rainfall of 16
inches, isn't considered desert, much of the rest of the state meets
the criteria: an empty, arid region with fewer than 10 inches of rain
per year, where evaporation exceeds rainfall.</TE>
<TE>   And drought, said National Weather Service hydrologist Brian
McInerney, is in the eye of the beholder.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to stay away from that word, because it means different
things to different people," McInerney said.</TE>
<TE>   There are three kinds of drought: climatic, hydrologic and
agricultural.</TE>
<TE>   The first two rely on 100 years of statistics but evaluate
snowpack levels only for the preceding 30 years when deciding what is
average--a tiny time span in general weather patterns, but practical
for agricultural and municipal water managers.</TE>
<TE>   An agricultural drought means farmers and ranchers are getting
less water than they need to function--a subjective measurement that
McCool finds irrational, especially for southern and eastern Utah.</TE>
<TE>   "That's like saying Canada is short of palm trees," he said. "We
don't have a water problem in the West. We have an
agricultural-subsidy problem."</TE>
<TE>   An acre-foot of residential water--about 326,000 gallons, roughly
enough to serve the needs of an average family of five for one
year--costs Utah households about $320, said Larry Anderson, the
state's director of water resources.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the efficiency of the irrigation system, an acre of
alfalfa needs from 2.7 to 6.5 acre-feet of water per crop. Center
pivot sprinkler irrigation uses the least water, flood irrigation the
most.</TE>
<TE>   Because most urban water is used on landscaping, water officials
are urging conservation methods such as limited sprinkling and
landscaping with drought-tolerant plants. Sometimes their suggestions
imply that saving water in Salt Lake will help drought-stricken
farmers to the south, but that's not possible. The water systems
aren't connected.</TE>
<TE>   Northern Utah water users rely on stream flow from the mountains
to the east; they pay about $5 per acre-foot for their irrigation
water, Anderson said. Southern Utah farmers get their water from the
Colorado River for about $10 per acre-foot. "That's probably the most
a farmer can pay and still make a profit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Because farmers hold rights to a certain amount of water, there's
no incentive to conserve, even in the desert. If reservoirs are full,
farmers grow extra crops. Utah doesn't even use all of its Colorado
River allotment, because there aren't enough dams to capture it.</TE>
<TE>   Agriculture's contribution to the state's economy hovers at 1%,
according to Neil Ashdown of the governor's management and budget
office.</TE>
<TE>   Subsidizing such a small industry "is doing a great disservice to
the taxpayers of America," McCool said. "I am not suggesting that we
pull the rug out from under all [farmers and ranchers], but it's time
for them to become self-sufficient."</TE>
<TE>   Cary Peterson, Utah agriculture commissioner, defends farming as
crucial to the state's economy and well-being, especially in rural
areas.</TE>
<TE>   "If desert is all you have for the families in a community,
farming makes the difference between whether you eat or not," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   To farmers, drought or not, getting the water they need is a
fundamental guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   "Water in Utah is a property right," Peterson said. "Those rights
were established very early in the West."</TE>
<TE>   Desert farmers grow high-value fruits and vegetables for export,
as well as high-protein alfalfa--the foundation of the livestock
industry, which makes up 76% of Utah's agriculture economy. Alfalfa
also serves to stabilize the soil in the fragile desert environment.</TE>
<TE>   McCool, however, singled out alfalfa as a Utah crop that would be
extinct without water subsidies because the cost to grow it is
greater than its market value.</TE>
<TE>   "There's this ideal of farmers who work hard--and they do, they
are the hardest-working people and the least economically viable--and
that's why we keep subsidizing them," McCool said.</TE>
<TE>   In Utah, where pioneer farmers are a source of pride, tradition
likely always would trump practical economics.</TE>
<TE>   "We know [desert farmers] are going to grow crops 'til the day
they die," said National Soil Conservation Service representative
Kresha Eastman.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Barton, whose irrigation district in the southeastern Utah
town of Ferron is taking advantage of federal subsidies to build a
more efficient sprinkling system, said that of the 300 farmers in his
district, only one relies entirely on farming to survive.</TE>
<TE>   The rest have jobs on the side. "That's still hurtful, to have to
admit I'm not a full-time farmer," Barton said.</TE>
<TE>   In the face of this drought and the certainty of more to come,
Barton acknowledged that farming in the desert can seem crazy.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so many of us who have that passion. If only we could
just make it," he said. "There's always hope for next year."</TE>

<HD>Tree-Sitters, Timber Sellers Still at Odds</HD>
<DH>Oregon: Begun 4 years ago, a protest continues against
old-growth logging in the Northwest as activists remain in the
Willamette National Forest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MABEN</AU>
<BD>THE (EUGENE) REGISTER GUARD</BD>
<DL>LOWELL, Ore.</DL>
<LD>They're still here, on plywood platforms and under blue tarps,
watching the forest from the treetops and waiting for word that their
efforts have paid off.</LD>
<LD>   Four years ago two young men climbed 180 feet up an old-growth
Douglas fir in the Willamette National Forest to block plans to log
96 acres of timber. Protesters say they've been there every day
since, making it the longest continuous tree-sit against old-growth
logging in the Northwest.</LD>
<LD>   "It really tells you something about the commitment of these guys
to protect what's left of mature and old-growth forests on public
lands," said James Johnston of the Cascadia Wildlands Project, a
Eugene-based environmental group. "I know they'll be out here another
four years, if that's what it takes."</LD>
<TE>   The battle, already marked by blockades, arrests and lawsuits, is
expected to rage on.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Forest Service has set aside 70% of the Clark sale area
to protect habitat for the red tree vole--a nocturnal, fir
needle-munching rodent that lives in the upper reaches of old Douglas
fir trees and is a staple of the northern spotted owl's diet.</TE>
<TE>   Still, activists say they're nowhere near ready to abandon their
perches and roadblocks.</TE>
<TE>   "We want of course to defend this until the sale is canceled," one
of the tree-sitters said.</TE>
<TE>   Timber industry leaders say they hope to see just the opposite at
Clark and other delayed timber sales in the Northwest.</TE>
<TE>   They're waiting to see if Bush administration officials will
loosen the grip on logging in public forests and restore the original
timber volume promised under President Clinton's much-criticized
Northwest Forest Plan.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the region, the forest plan was to provide 20% of the
historic harvest levels, but instead it has resulted in just 4% while
the Forest Service surveys for wildlife and the courts consider
ongoing legal battles.</TE>
<TE>   The Clark sale is "exactly the kind of timber sale that scientists
thought should go ahead under the Northwest Forest Plan," said Chris
West, vice president of the American Forest Resource Council, a
Portland-based industry group.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an isolated block of mature forest, and because of its small
size, it doesn't have as much importance as other stands that they
protected in the plan. That's why it was proposed for harvest," West
said.</TE>
<TE>   The timber was sold to Zip-O-Log Mills Inc. of Eugene in early
1998, but the company hasn't been able to start cutting. It's now
negotiating with Willamette forest officials over the logging
cutbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "The sale has changed substantially because of the numbers of red
tree vole nests," said Rick Scott, the Middle Fork District ranger.
"The question is, is it still an economically viable sale?"</TE>
<TE>   If Zip-O-Log accepts the modified sale, the company could log 29
acres as soon as this year, Scott said. Or the sale could be
canceled, if the company and the agency agree it has changed too
much.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think this was what they intended when they passed the
Northwest Forest Plan back in 1994," said Jim Hallstrom, president of
Zip-O-Log. "It was supposed to smooth things out and speed things up
and give the industry some kind of volume that they could count on.
And it just hasn't done that."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, timber harvested on the Willamette totaled 17 million
board-feet--far less than the 138 million board-feet promised under
the regional forest plan or the revised target of 111 million
board-feet adopted after the Willamette mapped creekside setbacks and
special habitat reserves.</TE>
<TE>   Forest Service officials in Washington, D.C., are now reviewing
which plants and animals they should continue to survey and protect
before allowing ground-disturbing projects to move forward on agency
lands.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists say they worry that industry pressure could lead
the Forest Service to drop the tree vole from the required survey
list, possibly returning the Clark timber sale to its original size.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole process is taking place behind closed doors," said
Leeanne Siart, a biologist in the Eugene office of the Oregon Natural
Resources Council, which is at the forefront of environmental
challenges in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Unsure what will happen--or when--the protesters plan to hold
their ground in the Fall Creek watershed about 25 miles east of
Eugene.</TE>
<TE>   In the first year, the Clark sale and the protest it spawned led
to repeated confrontations between activists and Forest Service
officers. In the last couple of years, officials mostly have left
them alone. But the activists are still ready for a showdown.</TE>
<TE>   Approaching the area, visitors encounter crude roadblocks along
the twisting spur roads leading to the stands marked for logging.
Activists built them from rocks and branches, hoping to slow down
anyone who drives in to try to remove them or dismantle their camps.</TE>
<TE>   Up one tree in a dense stand of old growth, a woman played the
flute. On a steep slope in a younger stand of trees, a young man
calling himself "Ta" offered to share some of the food he prepared
more than 100 feet up the trunk of a fir.</TE>
<TE>   Fruit Fly, a soft-spoken man with a thick, dark beard, pointed to
a tree in the stand that supports a tree vole nest.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service labeled the nest inactive, which doesn't prompt
a protective buffer, but he believes otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, it shows that much is left to be learned about where
the animal lives and what it needs to survive, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Every inactive nest could very well become active, so what's the
reason to cut it?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fruit Fly, in the base camp this day, also has taken his turn on
the doughnut-shaped platforms suspended by ropes high up in the
trees. It's lonely duty, and the wind and rain and cold can make it
bleak.</TE>
<TE>   But he also finds it refreshing and rewarding.</TE>
<TE>   "Things move a lot slower and you're kind of living in accordance
with the trees and nature and the animals and observing that rather
than observing traffic lights and horns and cars and lights and
stuff," he said. "In the upper canopy itself, there's a whole
different type of ecosystem."</TE>
<TE>   On the platforms, movement is limited.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why it's probably not good to spend forever in the tree,"
Fruit Fly said.</TE>
<TE>   "For human beings, we're not necessarily meant to live in trees
like that. Our habitat is different I guess. But it's a fun habitat
to hang out in," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It's also dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   A 22-year-old Portland woman died April 12 after falling 150 feet
from a platform at the Eagle Creek timber sale protest in the Mount
Hood National Forest near Estacada.</TE>
<TE>   That timber sale had been canceled three days before the
protester's death.</TE>
<TE>   Siart said the accident has hit the activist community hard and is
still sinking in. Tree-sitters know and accept the risks, but they
also are taught to follow strict safety guidelines, such as making
sure people use safety lines when they move from one platform to
another.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the Clark protest's recent four-year anniversary,
activists offered training in skills, such as tree-scaling basics and
safety protocols.</TE>
<TE>   For now, there appears to be no quick conclusion to the standoff.</TE>
<TE>   The timber industry has filed suit in federal court in Eugene
challenging the legality of the Forest Service's wildlife survey and
management program.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists have filed their own lawsuit in Seattle, where
decisions have tended to favor their causes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed that our political leaders haven't fixed this
problem," said Johnston of the Cascadia Wildlands Project, "but I'm
not surprised the public is still willing to clearly put their lives
on the line to protect places like this."</TE>

equipment distribution, restaurants, a vineyard and a line of
yachts--shot 67 in his first round. This guy even makes money off
grass. The Super Bowl once used Greg Norman Turf.</TE>
<TE>   If nobody calls on Norman's cell phone in the next three days to
set up some international merger in Sydney, he might have a chance
for one last moment of twilight golf glory.</TE>
<TE>   Please, don't anybody suggest that Norman hop in his private
helicopter to go to his private jet so that he can swing some big
Asian acquisition. He might be tempted. Corporate titan-ship holds
his love these days, but for a week, he can definitely squeeze golf
back into his heart.</TE>
<TE>   For a man who's only had four top-10 finishes since 1997, but
endured two major surgeries, this is a fine chance to show the golf
world he's not washed up. All that rehab was worth the trouble. And
his hip surgery--with video on the Internet--wasn't just to provide,
shall we say, "unique" programming for his Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "A win would mean a lot to me," said Norman, who has had only one
contending chance this season, starting the final round of the
Houston Open in sixth place, but fading to 23rd with a 76. "It would
be a reinforcement of the belief in myself that I can do it."</TE>
<TE>   No golfer has ever needed that resilient "belief in myself" more
than Norman, with his six heart-breaking runner-up finishes in major
championships--some self-inflicted, but most the result of miracle
shots against him.</TE>
<TE>   And no golfer has ever lost on the world stage, rebounded and
tried again with more good grace than Norman.</TE>
<TE>   He even had the grit to put his hand back in the fire at the
Masters in '99, finishing third, after his seven-shot blown lead with
a final-round 78 in '96.</TE>
<TE>   "If I didn't think I could put myself in position to win this golf
tournament, I wouldn't be here, trust me," Norman said.</TE>
<TE>   Logic, history, precedent? Why bow to that? Even Jack Nicklaus
never won again after his Masters at 46. But Norman thinks he will.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got too many other things I love to do in life to come out
here and feel like I'm just walking around the golf course," said
Norman, who ran off three straight birdies at the 14th, 15th and 16th
holes with birdie putts of 12, 24 and 12 feet. "So it really would be
the fulfillment of how I feel inside that, yes, you can still do it.</TE>
<TE>   "And today was a good indication of that, even though it was only
one round."</TE>
<TE>   If the rocks and creeks at Avenel know what's good for them, they
will give Norman every good bounce the next three days. Because if
they don't, he may just replace the whole darn course and move the
Kemper to a track of his own in a few years.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Norman discussed his plans for a $20 million elite
course at the Lansdowne Resort near Leesburg, Va. There's already
talk that, after the current Kemper-Avenel contract runs out in 2006,
Norman's layout might eventually get some of the Kemper action.</TE>
<TE>   That's a long way down the road, but if Norman rattles a few into
the woods, the oaks and pines might keep it in mind. Someday,
Chairman Shark might hold this course's fate in his fins.</TE>
<TE>   If Norman somehow beat the long odds and capped his Tour career
with one last victory, it would certainly feel appropriate if he did
it here in the Kemper. His first PGA Tour victory came in 1984 at
Congressional, where he repeated in '86. Since the Kemper moved to
the TPC at Avenel, he's often excited the crowds with near misses,
finishing third once and fourth on three occasions.</TE>
<TE>   At other choice Kemper moments, he's gently suggested course
changes ("blow up the ninth hole"), given the finger to the crowd,
annoyed promoters by pulling out belatedly and even berated the
first-tee announcer for making a joke at his expense.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, this is Norman's first trip back to the Kemper since that
famous first-tee dustup when the announcer made a remark about
President Bill Clinton falling down the stairs at Norman's house in
Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "It's water over the dam," Norman said earlier this week. "I
thought what he said was in bad taste. Whenever you have a situation
like that, that's very personal to you, it's hard for someone else to
make a flippant remark like that. And that's what I told him. But
that didn't stop me from coming back here."</TE>
<TE>   Norman, a prodigious driver, was once almost a prohibitive
over-dog when he arrived here. From his wealth to his glamour to a
fame disproportionate to his two major championships, Norman was an
easy target for Tour resentment.</TE>
<TE>   But, in sports, where the normal life cycle is accelerated, age
changes all. At a point when he's still a corporate up-and-comer,
Norman is now a golf old man, an underdog routinely outdistanced by
young pups.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because you get out-driven doesn't mean to say you (have to)
get outplayed. Length is a huge advantage. I was a testament to
that," Norman said.</TE>
<TE>   "So (as) you get older, you lose some of that ability ... (but)
you just work with what your game is."</TE>
<TE>   Such as that golf game is and as long as it lasts, the Kemper Open
will gladly take it.</TE>
<TE>   You never know when a Shark sighting on the leader board--once so
common here -- could be the last.</TE>

<LD>I read James Ricci's column "Memories of a 'Collapsed Catholic' "
(Metropolis, May 5) after coming back from church. The first thing I felt
was anger, then disgust, then pity. I pity all of the people who think
the way Ricci does. People like him allow the misdeeds of a couple of
priests who broke their oath to corrupt their faith. It is sad that
people who are so empty inside allow themselves to be persuaded by the
actions of a couple of priests. Catholicism and religion should not be
left behind because of the misdeeds of a follower. It is sad to see that
so many people have become followers and not leaders when it comes to
religion. Perhaps it is good that Ricci is no longer Catholic, because
the church needs true believers and leaders with their own thoughts and
opinions.</LD>

<LD>I had a nice, ironic chuckle reading about David Rosenthal ("The
Loneliness of the Long-Distance Ranter," by Janet Reitman, May 5). As the
neo-New Yorker walked around in idealized wonder at his new town, having
escaped the evils of Hollywood, I remembered my time in the financial
industry (New York City's Hollywood) before I started to work in the
entertainment business. The vile and unapologetic misogyny, racism,
homophobia and ruthlessness--to say nothing of the nepotism and sickening
snobbery--I witnessed on my trading floor made the behavior I've seen in
Hollywood seem like amateur hour. Any managing director on Wall Street
would make an agent seem like a Teletubby. Perhaps I've been lucky, but
the people I've worked with in Hollywood have been generally enlightened
and ethical. Tough at times? Sure, but guess what? It's big business.</LD>

<LD>As a former West Virginian, I was thrilled to read Peter Slavin's
excellent article about Massey Energy Co.'s continuing devastation of
West Virginia's mountains and its harassment of the citizens of the Big
Coal River Valley ("Razing Appalachia," May 5). I am especially proud of
Judy Bonds and other Coal River Mountain Watch folks who are fighting
Massey's destruction of people's health and homes. The plight of West
Virginia is no different from that of a Third World country that is
exploited and polluted by outside interests.</LD>

<LD>For those of us who have a family member with bipolar disorder, the
vivid descriptions of Marie Elise West's delusions have an uncanny
similarity to things we have heard ("Prelude to a Death," by Paul Teetor,
May 5). The constant episodes of relapse also ring true. This is a very
dangerous and little understood disease that often destroys the patient
and the family. The LPS Act must be modified so that families have the
power and authority to mandate treatment, including involuntary
commitment to inpatient facilities and the administration of psychotropic
medication. California should not be the place where you have the right
to act crazy and destroy your life and the lives of innocent people. How
many people have to suffer the fate of Jesus Plascencia before we change
this outdated and ill-conceived law?</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Around the quadrangle of tables, a dozen young women are coaching
each other, many talking simultaneously, about how to stay financially
afoot on the unaccustomed landscape of adulthood.</LD>
<LD>   "Don't work at a place where you can buy stuff."</LD>
<LD>   "They'll give you a check card, and you can swipe it anywhere. Don't
do it, girl!"</LD>
<TE>   "Use coupons. They add up. Cut them things out."</TE>
<TE>   When Tiynesha Coleman begins to speak, the others fall silent. The
gravity of her tone and the seriousness of her mien command attention.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't do something you can't afford," she warns. "I'm paying on three
credit cards that are maxed out. I'm paying on a car, an apartment. I
don't have time for anything. All I do is work, work, work, and take care
of my daughter. It's lonely, and it's hard."</TE>
<TE>   It would be difficult to assemble a group facing a more harrowing
passage into adult life than these young women. Participants in the Los
Angeles Florence Crittenton Center's after-care program, they are in
their late teens and early 20s. All "emancipated" at 18 from a childhood
of multiple foster homes, many having ended their years as a minor living
at the Crittenton center, a luckless girls' home of last resort. Most
already are mothers and alone. Emerging from the unsteadiest of
childhoods, they commonly require instruction in everything from job
interviewing to food shopping to having a normal conversation with a
stranger. The young women are under a kind of curse laid by irresponsible
parents and other adults. Dispelling it will require the sort of
unstinting resolve rarely demanded of those whose upbringings were more
blessed.</TE>
<TE>   A case in point, Tiynesha Coleman. She is 22. At 6, she was taken from
her drug-addled parents in West Covina. She was 12 and in her second
foster home when her mother died of a heroin overdose. "They found her in
an alley," Tiynesha says.</TE>
<TE>   As a teenager, she shied from social life, embarrassed by not living
with her parents and having none of the fashionable possessions by which
adolescents calibrate each other's worth. She became attached to a boy of
similar unmoorings.</TE>
<TE>   She was 16 and in her third foster home when she found out she was
pregnant with his child. Her condition required her to move to a fourth
home. At 19, she graduated from John Muir High School in Pasadena and
entered county-financed transitional housing with her daughter,
Bridgette. A year later, her erstwhile boyfriend broke into the dwelling
and beat Tiynesha up, drawing a prison term as a consequence.</TE>
<TE>   Tiynesha completed, after high school, an eight-month course to become
a medical assistant, and she took a full-time job, Monday through Friday,
at a Covina doctor's office. It pays $8.50 an hour. She got an additional
job as a patient "sitter" at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena,
working 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays. Her monthly income is
$2,036. With a small, temporary rent subsidy from Crittenton for her
two-bedroom apartment in Rowland Heights and a $40 monthly gasoline
allowance, she makes ends meet.</TE>
<TE>   Five-year-old Bridgette, meanwhile, shuttles between day care and Head
Start and typically falls asleep at night alongside her mother. Tiynesha
insists on evenings with her daughter, her 56-hour workweek
notwithstanding (she hopes a recently completed nurse's assistant course
will soon enable her to make do with one better-paying job).</TE>
<TE>   Of course, she has no time for a social life. "I never had a childhood
and am not having a young adulthood," she says. "I get depressed. I'd
like to have a companion, but I'm not looking for anyone. I'm putting all
my energy into Bridgette and into getting my education and getting on
with my career. I have a picture cut out of the house I want someday, of
the car I want. And I know what I want for my daughter--to send her to
the best colleges, no matter what it costs. I want to travel with her to
Europe on vacation, instead of just taking her to the park."</TE>
<TE>   To those ends, Tiynesha has a plan. In August she'll begin preparatory
courses for entering the licensed vocational nurse program at Citrus
Community College in Glendora. "So, not later than February 2004, I
should be working as an LVN." Doing that 12 hours a day, five days a
week, she estimates, she can earn plenty. "Then I'd have weekends with my
daughter."</TE>
<TE>   She'll cut her workweek to four days, however, when she enters Mt. San
Antonio College in fall 2004, with plans to graduate as a registered
nurse no later than 2006. After that, she'll study for a bachelor's
degree at UCLA or USC or Cal State Dominguez Hills, which, she projects,
will take an additional two or three years.</TE>
<TE>   Then--tallest self-set obstacle of all--medical school. Getting her
M.D. will require about 6 1/2 more years, according to her calculations.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time I'm 35 or 40," she says, "I should be OK."</TE>
<TE>   Tiynesha's journey is bound to include barricades and detours she
can't currently envision, but it's remarkable how the very misfortune
that framed her young life seems to have given her a reliable sense of
direction. She may prove an anomaly among the young women chattering
around the Crittenton tables. I hope not. Wish them all well.</TE>

<LD>Mumsey Nemiroff's job is to help you get lucky. During her 40 years
in the decorative arts business, the independent art consultant and
historian has crisscrossed the globe hunting pedigreed pieces for a
clientele that includes the state of California, Raffles L'Ermitage hotel
and countless law firms. Nemiroff recently offered pointers in a lecture
at the seventh annual Los Angeles Antiques Show in Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   So what's the key to making the big score?</LD>
<LD>   First and foremost, take the time to learn your area. For example, if
you're buying pre-Columbian art on a street corner in Guatemala, spit on
it. If it's really old, your saliva should be absorbed, because it will
be very porous. Train your fingers to feel cracks and [evidence of]
restoration that aren't detectable by the naked eye. Make friends in the
collecting community. You never know who will let you in on an exclusive
tip.</LD>
<TE>   How does a novice gain expertise?</TE>
<TE>   Start by haunting the finest antique stores and galleries. Even if you
think you can't afford anything, go in, ask questions and look around.
Estate sales are good resources, too. You need to look at the best
examples of what you want to collect. Once you become an expert, then you
can go to the yard sales and flea markets.</TE>
<TE>   What are some common mistakes made by collectors?</TE>
<TE>   Collectors either buy too quickly or not fast enough. In London once I
spotted an absolutely wonderful Ashanti stool. I left without it because
I didn't want to pack it. Then I began obsessing over it. When I went
back, someone was carrying it right past me. But other times we talk
ourselves into something. We want it so badly that we overlook obvious
flaws.</TE>
<TE>   How do you spot a fake?</TE>
<TE>   I can't stress this enough: do your research. Use reference books to
make comparisons. There is no such thing as he or she has a "good eye."
You only have a good eye if you have an educated eye.</TE>
<TE>   What's your own best discovery?</TE>
<TE>   One of my favorites is a 16th century clepsydra, which is an early
water clock. You pour water into a receptacle and it drips down into
another receptacle. As the water drips out, a weight is lowered and that
moves the hands of the clock. My husband and I found it in the Paris flea
market.</TE>
<TE>   Why is the "Antiques Roadshow" such a phenomenon?</TE>
<TE>   It's all about profit. Everybody wants to win the lottery, and
antiques are essentially a way to do that. It plays into the consumerism
of today. But don't get me wrong, I think the show's great because it's
popularizing something that can become the most enriching thing in your
life.</TE>
<TE>   What's the first thing to do after you've struck gold?</TE>
<TE>   Assuming that you can afford it--our aesthetic usually leaps beyond
our wallet--remember that we live in earthquake country. I'm a big
believer that you never own an antique. You are only its temporary
custodian. Fine-art insurance is extremely reasonable, and in case of
damage, you'll have the funds to find a reliable restorer.</TE>

<HD>What's So Funny About Peace, Love and Qiana?</HD>

<LD>Invited to: "Peace and Love to Erase MS" benefit gala at the
Century Plaza Hotel, hosted by Sela Ward and Jay Mohr, with performances
by Don Henley, Stevie Nicks, Smokey Robinson and Donna Summer.</LD>
<LD>   The theme police: "I thought about where we are in the world right now
and what could be a better theme than peace and love?" asks Nancy Davis
of this groovy twist on her ninth annual celebrity-filled fund-raiser.
(Davis, scion of the billion-dollar Marvin Davis empire, was diagnosed
with multiple sclerosis in 1991.) In a room lousy with Davises, Tisches
and Spellings (given his status as the sultan of '70s TV, Aaron's
wide-collar Qiana shirt seems superfluous), Angela Bassett redefines the
word "bigwig" by sporting a galaxy-sized 'fro. Others miss the mark on
the '70s dress code. "I got confused, I got conservative and I got it
wrong," worries "Friend" Lisa Kudrow in charcoal-with-white-pinstripe
Armani, her closest sartorial hint at the '70s being the heart-shaped
peace sign dangling from her neck. Ironically, "That '70s Show's" Ashton
Kutcher and Kiss' Paul Stanley show up in civvies. Still, it's not like
everyone doesn't know why we're here. Along with the $1,000-a-plate
buy-in, the crowd bids its way through a silent auction that has
everything from the sublime (jewelry and vacation packages) to the
ridiculous (autographed pair of Tom Arnold's jeans, anyone?), ultimately
raising $2.5 mil for the cause.</LD>
<TE>   Love, American style: "We can come up with $3,000 in hairpieces
alone," announces actor-comedian Jay Mohr, explaining that this is the
portion of the show where he's "supposed to ad-lib and be funny."
Following a Tommy Hilfiger fashion show (featuring Montel Williams,
actress Holly Robinson Peete and a few ex-"Charlie's Angels"), comes a
live auction presided over by "the Three Stooges," as Tony Danza calls
the trio composed of himself, Bill Maher and Tom Arnold. Comedian Jon
Lovitz walks away with a $21,000 LeRoy Neiman, Montel Williams buys a
trip to Olympic luge camp for $16K, while Ray Romano coughs up $21,000 to
throw "The Ultimate Hollywood Party" at home for himself and 49 of his
nearest and dearest with everything from Wolfgang Puck catering to
Chuck's parking service included.</TE>
<TE>   Next comes the real entertainment. "We were competitors in the '70s,
but now we're good friends," says Don Henley, introducing the next act,
Stevie Nicks. But Smokey smokes 'em all with a velvety "Tracks of my
Tears" and an unpretentious, low-key call to arms against MS. The stage
is left to Donna Summer, who gets the crowd discoing to "Hot Stuff."
Others can't resist the hot stuff outside, and with duffel-sized goody
bags slung over their shoulders, they gamely try to beat the valet
bottleneck.</TE>

<LD>Can't stand the music in the car next to yours? Picture this: the
teenage Buddy Collette and Charles Mingus jamming together while riding
downtown from Watts during the '30s on L.A.'s bygone Red Car trolley
line. Along with serving as a rhythm section for budding jazz legends,
the Red Car's woody squeaks, bells and clacking steel embodied
on-the-move Los Angeles for decades--and now there are signs of a Red Car
revival.</LD>
<LD>   The nonprofit Los Angeles Red Car Concept hopes to reconnect
downtown's entertainment, business and government centers for tourists
and downtowners with a nine-mile loop line from USC/Exposition Park to
Chinatown using replicas of the Pacific Electric Red Cars that ran
throughout Los Angeles from 1903 until the last cars were discontinued in
1961.</LD>
<LD>   For better or worse, the MTA is not involved at this point, but
through the efforts of Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles),
$100,000 in federal funds has been earmarked for a feasibility study.
(LARC, which has a mailing list of nearly 500, hopes to raise $250,000 to
$300,000 in additional funds from downtown businesses and other sources.)
Roybal-Allard recalls flushing with pride while riding Red Cars on dates
during her Boyle Heights girlhood. Then and now, she says, "people need a
fun way to get from one end of downtown to the other."</LD>
<TE>   The Red Car group's chief conductor-in-waiting is George Eslinger, 63,
a retired city engineer formerly in charge of L.A.'s street lamp
department. A LARC co-founder in 1997, Eslinger has been volunteering for
the group since his retirement in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Would a trolley attract patrons other than tourists-- Mr. Wingtip and
Ms. Stiletto en route to the opera,  dare say? It's an open question,
though a Red Car  renaissance is also afoot in San Pedro, where a
1.5-mile line linking Port of Los Angeles tourist  spots is scheduled to
launch in September.</TE>
<TE>   Revived lines have flourished in New Orleans, Seattle  and
SanFrancisco, but success has been mixed in  smaller cities. Planners
agree that success would  take collaboration between government agencies
and neighborhood groups, and regular use by  downtown workers and
residents. Says Rick Laubscher, president of the support group for San
Francisco's  popular Market Street F Line: "If it's a toy, my  advice is
don't do it, because it's going to be a real  expensive toy."</TE>

<LD>"You're not looking to purchase something; you're just out
somewhere, like the auto shop. And somebody comes up to you and says,
'Wanna buy some chicken?' " That's how 22-year-old Dallas Clayton
explains the serendipitous method by which he peddles his self-produced
chapbooks. Bypassing conventional publishing channels, he hawks the
homespun 'zines outside of nightclubs, at farmers markets or in movie
lines by simply asking Angelenos if they want to buy a book for a dollar.
"I just go wherever there are lines of people," he says.</LD>
<LD>   A buck buys a postcard-sized, photocopied booklet of diary-like
musings written by Dallas, who publishes using only his first name. A
bimonthly series, the chapbooks are roughly the same size each time, but
each issue has a different title. "Been Meaning to Keep a Journal,"
"Playing Stickball on Company Time" and "The Used Car Collection" are
representative examples. Dallas photocopies and hand-assembles the books,
which he produces in runs of 1,000. Covers are becoming increasingly
elaborate, integrating flotsam such as postcards, board game trivia
cards, stamps and other odd items. On a good day, Dallas vends more than
100 at a given location, and he usually sells out each issue's run.</LD>
<TE>   "I get a ridiculously positive response," says the one-man publishing
enterprise, who was raised in North Carolina and moved to Los Angeles in
1999. "It's something you can only do in big cities, since there's enough
circulating people." While Dallas agrees that "it would be pretty sweet
to be able to write for a living," the series is primarily about literary
expression. "It's a pure outlet," he says. "With other [writing] jobs,
there's different criteria, and formats and backers that make you change
things."</TE>
<TE>   A buyer at the Hollywood farmers market turned out to be an employee
at MOCA, whose gift shop now stocks the books, as does Book Soup on the
Sunset Strip. The series has developed a small following, despite the
fact that much of its readership got hooked by accidentally bumping into
the author. "I don't want to make it an obligation, like I need to move
this amount of product," says Dallas. "I go places where I'll probably be
going anyway."</TE>

<DH>USC's Craig Stanford Believes That Chimpanzees Are as Intelligent
as 2-Year-Old Children. If He's Right, Zoos and Research Laboratories
Have a Lot of Explaining to Do.</DH>

<LD>Adam Stanford teeters atop a log, studying Jerrard. They gaze at
each other through a glass divider--a flaxen-haired 5-year-old boy and
his 12-year-old counterpart--as if assessing a possible playmate. Adam is
wearing a modish blue shirt, pressed khaki shorts and sneakers. Jerrard
is wearing no clothes at all, because that's not required of chimpanzees
living in the Mahale Mountain enclosure at the Los Angeles Zoo.</LD>
<LD>   Jerrard turns, showing off his broad shoulders, lanky arms and a
resplendent, hairy, heavily muscled back. Adam turns too, shaking his
arms as if working out kinks or comparing physiques, aping the
chimpanzee. "You know, we are an ape," he murmurs. Adam's father cracks
up. "I didn't put him up to that," he says.</LD>
<LD>   Craig Stanford, 44, is chair of the anthropology department at USC and
an emerging star in a new generation of great ape field researchers. He
regularly commutes from Los Angeles, where he teaches at USC and
co-directs the university's Jane Goodall Research Center, to the rolling
hills of the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda, where he's
engaged in a long-term study of gorillas and chimpanzees.</LD>
<TE>   It feels a bit surreal to stand outside this enclosure with Stanford.
Mahale Mountain, after all, is the name of an actual wild chimpanzee
study site in Tanzania. Next to the zoo's faux mountain is a faux Gombe,
a kitsch representation of Jane Goodall's storied study site in the same
country. A tent much like the one she lived in during her early field
studies opens over a concrete walkway, and copies of her early notes are
on display under glass. Stanford conducted research at the real Gombe,
and he only heightens the dissonance by turning away from the captive
chimpanzees to say they're quite unlike the wild creatures he's studied
over the years. "They're just different animals," he says. "The
chimpanzees I work with evolved in an African forest in response to
pressures of an African forest."</TE>
<TE>   The implication is that you can't learn what you need to know about
chimpanzees by observing them in captive circumstances. This notion has
not endeared Stanford to the nation's zookeepers and their in-house
primatologists. But what really rankles some of his colleagues is
Stanford's belief that captive apes are akin to young human children.
"Keeping great apes in zoos is morally questionable, and in laboratories
reprehensible," he writes in his latest book, "Significant Others." "The
intellect of a chimpanzee is similar to that of a small child or a
cognitively impaired adult."</TE>
<TE>     In addition to the estimated 200,000 chimpanzees still alive in
Africa, there are 1,700 or so chimps in zoos around the world and
hundreds in primate research centers for use in everything from
behavioral studies to biomedical research. Stanford is challenging not
only the most invasive sort of medical research--say, injecting
chimpanzees with viral strains and caging them in close quarters to see
what happens--he's also taking aim at behavioral experiments in
laboratory settings and even the practice of keeping apes in the
country's best zoos, like this one.</TE>
<TE>   Taking his invocation literally would mean shutting down most great
ape research in this country. Monkeys still would be kept in captivity
for HIV, malaria and tuberculosis research as well as studies on juvenile
aggression. But the four kinds of primates that are most closely related
to human beings from an evolutionary point of view--chimpanzees, bonobos,
gorillas and orangutans--would be placed off limits, as they are in New
Zealand. The debate over the ethics of "imprisoning" great apes has
bubbled away among primate specialists for years, often beneath the
surface. They've fussed with one another about whether likening apes to
human children is accurate or fair, about whether brainpower should be
the trump factor for figuring out which animals deserve special
protection, and whether genetic relatedness to human beings should carry
special weight in bioethical considerations.</TE>
<TE>   "Look," says Stanford, gesturing at the group of chimpanzees gamboling
near the enclosure's waterfall. "From a neurological point of view, these
animals are the most complex creatures on earth, maybe in the universe,
besides dolphins, whales and us. The only thing that separates them from
2-year-old children is that we're human, they're not. Eventually, you
have to make a decision about where to draw the line."</TE>
<TE>   During her first few years at Gombe in the early 1960s, Jane Goodall,
an unknown researcher without a college degree, knocked a rather large
hole in the idea of the traditional dividing line--tool use--between
human beings and apes. Since then, painstaking incremental progress has
followed from both field studies of wild apes and experiments with
captive animals around the world. These studies have demonstrated that
great apes use tools, recognize themselves in mirrors, have diverse
"traditions," manage complicated social lives, engage in sophisticated
politics and have the ability to count and use symbolic language.
Brilliant apes such as Washoe, the chimpanzee whose expertise in sign
language was made famous by Roger Fouts, and Kanzi, the bonobo who
communicates complicated messages to Sue Savage-Rumbaugh by pointing at
symbols on a board, reinforced the popular expectation that primate
research would simply continue to flesh out the similarities.</TE>
<TE>   Stories about these breakthroughs have filled gee-whiz columns in
newspapers and fueled decades of National Geographic broadcasts. Less
visible from a general reader's point of view are the often fierce
critiques by contrarian scholars who feel their colleagues downplay deep
differences between humans and other primate species. "They're trying to
make chimps into human beings, trying to mold them in our image!" one
scholar has complained to me.</TE>
<TE>   It's a minor irony that Stanford wound up in the midst of this debate
after backing into chimpanzee research in the first place. In 1988, as a
graduate student in anthropology studying a monkey called the capped
langur in Bangladesh, he wrote to Jane Goodall, asking if he could come
to Gombe. He was curious not so much about the chimpanzees but about the
colobus monkeys that were hunted by the chimps.</TE>
<TE>   For six years in the early 1990s, Stanford followed both the hunted
colobus monkeys and the hunting chimps through a series of bloody
encounters. He documented 120 of these chimpanzee hunts in a novel way,
recording them from the point of view of both predator and prey.
"Everybody told me I wouldn't be able to do this," Stanford remembers.
"What I did is comparable to standing in the middle of a herd of zebras
and watching the lion attack--from the prey's perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Stanford made his mark with the hunting study. In a series of
scholarly journal articles and two books ("The Hunting Apes" and
"Chimpanzee and Red Colobus"), he fleshed out his view that the
acquisition and sharing of meat is a kind of proxy for power in chimp
society. He also drew a fair share of critics, particularly those who
thought his theory was sexist for placing too much emphasis on the males,
who do most of the hunting. One noted scholar, Adrienne Zihlman, calls
Stanford's research "a throwback" to anthropological studies that
overemphasized the dominance and status of men.</TE>
<TE>   Once hooked on great ape research through his exposure to chimpanzee
hunting, Stanford didn't let go. For the past dozen years he's been
shuttling regularly from a quiet academic life in this country to field
work in Africa. In his office at USC on the day before our visit to the
zoo, we screen videotapes of wild chimpanzees from the early years at
Gombe. These aren't images for the squeamish.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, my gosh, that's the one of Frodo killing Apricot," Stanford calls
out as we watch an adult male chimpanzee snatch a tiny monkey infant from
its mother's arms, swiftly bite the baby in the brain and rend its flesh.
A few reels on, we view a scene more amenable to a soft heart. A group of
chimps stumbles across a dead bushbuck, its carcass already hollowed out.
The chimps hoot, screaming as if in protest. They run their hands along
the antelope's skin. Then Gigi, an adult female, caresses the antelope's
head, draping its legs over her shoulders as if wearing a stole.</TE>
<TE>   "She's not treating it like food, that's for sure," Stanford says.
Perhaps Gigi was putting herself in the other animal's place for a
moment. Many cognitive psychologists don't believe that great apes have
what they call "theory of mind," the ability to put oneself in another's
shoes. Stanford is quick to point out that Gigi's play provides only
anecdotal evidence, the suggestion of a possibility. But who's to say for
sure whether great apes in the wild can place themselves in another's
skin?</TE>
<TE>   Stanford also pulls out pictures of his study site in the Bwindi
Impenetrable National Park. He's excited about several new discoveries.
On a trip in the spring of 2001, he came across a group of chimpanzees
spending long periods of time standing upright in the trees. Since
"bipedality" is among the key differences between early human beings and
the great apes, such observations could help flesh out an understanding
of how early hominids developed the ability to stand on two feet for
extended periods.</TE>
<TE>   During that visit, Stanford and John Bosco Nkurunungi, a Ugandan
researcher who works with him, also chanced upon a group of chimpanzees
and gorillas feeding peacefully side by side in the park. The encounter
was surprising; wouldn't the two species compete for scarce food
resources or seek different foods to avoid conflict?</TE>
<TE>   "I'd just finished identifying most of this community of chimpanzees,
when all of a sudden there was this much blacker face in the middle of
all the chimps," Stanford recalls. They watched as a large male gorilla
joined the lone gorilla in a group of chimpanzees; the gorillas sat a few
feet away, ignoring the chimps. Field assistants working with Nkurunungi
and Stanford also have reported that they've seen an infant gorilla
trying to play with an infant chimp.</TE>
<TE>   These fresh discoveries reinforce Stanford's feeling for what he calls
a "custodial obligation" toward the apes and his deepening belief that
chimpanzees, as living links between a primate "common ancestor" and
ourselves, deserve special protection. Differences in behavior and
cognition, he says, will prove to be matters of degree, not kind. He
predicts that human brains will turn out to be "exploded versions of the
chimpanzee mind."</TE>
<TE>   We don't pen 2-year-old children in outdoor enclosures to educate us,
or cage them in laboratories for biomedical experiments to help save us
from disease, or train them to act ferocious in feature films such as Tim
Burton's "Planet of the Apes" to entertain us. Why, then, Stanford asks,
do our close primate cousins deserve this treatment?</TE>
<TE>   For years animal-rights activists, notably the organizers of the
Portland-based Great Ape Project, have campaigned for the preservation of
apes' liberty and their "protection from torture." And plenty of purists
have complained all along that great ape researchers fight only for the
improvement of conditions for chimpanzees, not for other animals as well.
What is new is the intensity of the argument among primatologists
themselves. A wedge has opened between field researchers and laboratory
experimenters in a debate now put in increasingly fervent, and personal,
terms.</TE>
<TE>   In a panel discussion about ethics at the national convention of the
American Society of Primatologists in Savannah, Ga., last summer, this
split was on display when a questioner suddenly set off an agitated
flurry. "Why do we hold these animals in captivity at all?" she asked.
One of the presenters, Joseph Bielitzki, former chief veterinary officer
at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research
Center in California, reacted as if he'd been slapped. He launched an
impassioned attack on the idea that great apes have inherent rights.
Critics were "granting moral authority to the great apes," Bielitzki
said. "I can't do that. I just don't think they have the same moral
agency as the people in this room!" One zoo primatologist replied flatly
that without apes and other exotic animals on display, the drawing power
of zoos would disappear. A biomedical specialist pointed out that testing
thalidomide and other chemicals on nonhuman primates had protected untold
numbers of human beings in this country from illness, birth defects and
deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford doubts whether anyone can show that invasive biomedical
research on great apes is necessary. He points to the calamitous history
of HIV research on chimpanzees. For years federal researchers bred
chimpanzees in the search for AIDS treatments. More than 100 chimps were
injected with the human version of the virus. But these infected chimps
proved to be poor study subjects largely because the disease incubates
slowly in chimpanzee bodies. Now the primate research centers have been
left to care for 100 infected, and dying, young chimps.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody asks whether I would feel the same if cancer could be cured
through research on chimpanzees," Stanford says. "But the key word is
'if.' How many cases do we have where great apes were actually the
critical testing ground in curing disease? The idea that this kind of
invasive biomedical experimentation will lead to a breakthrough is just a
fallacy. I don't see any evidence that there is a real prospect for some
breakthrough in chimps as opposed to research using rats and rabbits."</TE>
<TE>   This is all hotly contested territory, including Stanford's claim that
chimpanzees deserve a hold on our collective conscience because they have
the intelligence of 2-year-old children. I quickly discovered how tricky
the issue is during a presentation by Daniel Povinelli at last summer's
annual convention of the American Psychological Assn. in San Francisco.
Povinelli, a psychologist from the University of Louisiana, is the young
bete noire of researchers who stress the similarities between great apes
and human beings. Introduced by an elderly researcher from Stanford
University as "the best scientist in the world on chimpanzee cognition,"
Povinelli showed a beautiful shot of an exuberant chimpanzee grinning, a
photo you might expect to gin up a lecture about how apes are
Just-Like-Us. But for any psychologist in the audience expecting such a
presentation, he threw a quick curve. Chimpanzees do not have, he said in
a deadpan tone, "a watered-down version of the human mind."</TE>
<TE>   During the past decade, Povinelli has devoted much of his time to
unraveling the core arguments of researchers like Stanford who think that
the differences between human beings and great apes are matters of
degree. "Cut through all the BS. The more you work with chimpanzees and
with human children, the more you start to see that there's this profound
mixture of similarity and difference at every age from birth forward," he
said after his talk. He repeated the phrase a few times, perhaps fearful
that I'd miss it: "Similar and different from birth forward."</TE>
<TE>   Chimpanzees and humans naturally share basic neural circuitry and
cognitive patterns, thanks to a common ancestor, Povinelli says. But he
thinks there's a qualitatively different overlay--a sort of parallel
system--operating in humans. This system, which Povinelli believes
distinguishes us from all other animals, allows human beings to speculate
about the internal lives of other beings and to track the effects of
unseen forces. The basis for the difference, Povinelli suspects, is an
impulse to construct narrative, to link past, present and future in a
story.</TE>
<TE>   Povinelli argues that great ape conservationists are making a big
strategic mistake when they liken chimpanzee minds to the cognition of
2-year-old human children. That could boomerang, he says, making the
great apes more vulnerable instead. He supports conservation efforts in
Africa and improved conditions for captive apes at home. "We should treat
chimps with respect and take into consideration their real interests and
needs. But all of those things can be taken care of without saying they
are the same as humans--that's one thing I know they're not."</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, friction over such disparate theories is rooted in
decades-old rivalry between laboratory experimenters and field
researchers. Experimenters focused on the intricate workings of cognition
tend to dismiss wild ape researchers as irrelevant romantics too enamored
of their own anecdotes. "You could do that kind of work for a thousand
years, observing natural behavior, spontaneous behavior, and you'd never,
ever come closer to understanding whether great apes have a theory of
mind!" Povinelli says. Scholars who observe apes in the wild tend to
think of those who work with captive animals as narrow-minded dopes
focused on neat lab tricks, sophisticated data manipulation and arcane
theory that only obscures a deep understanding of real animals. Animals
held in captivity, especially highly intelligent and social apes, are
invariably impoverished, they argue. If they behave quite unlike animals
in the wild, what's the value of research? "It's like looking through a
cracked window," Stanford says softly. Like many other prominent great
ape researchers, he opposes a proposed Povinelli study in which orphaned
baby chimpanzees would be raised in human homes for several years to
observe whether they develop more human-like ways of thinking. "What
Povinelli does, holding out these animals as normal, it's absurd,"
Stanford says. "Think it through. What would you learn about normal
children by studying Bosnian war orphans?"</TE>
<TE>   At stake is the future direction of primate research, which hangs in
the balance in the midst of potentially divisive bids for public support.
So too does an altered view of human nature, for how we end up thinking
about the great apes shapes how we see ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   The two Stanfords and I take seats on a platform overlooking the
Mahale Mountain enclosure at the L.A. Zoo to watch the chimps and their
primate cousins. Adam's attention is now fixed on dozens of teenage Homo
sapiens held back by a railing. Stanford scuffs his sandals on the ground
and shifts uncomfortably as I press him about zoo exhibits like this one.
Perhaps he's torn between increasingly firm opinions and his friendships
with the keeper here and a network of researchers who study captive apes
in centers around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "So what do you mean to suggest?" I ask, pointing past a crowd of
people calling out to the chimps. The 38,000-square-foot enclosure is
surrounded by ficus, magnolia and banana trees. Palms and rock
promontories shadow a grassy expanse. Faux logs are stuffed with nuts and
leaves to keep the chimps active. "Are you saying this enclosure
shouldn't exist?"</TE>
<TE>   Judeo, a formidable senior male in the group, shows off his impressive
pectorals, throwing his arms wide. "A few might still exist for education
purposes maybe," Stanford says. But he adds that no more great apes
should be bred in captivity, and most of those already held should be
released into large sanctuaries where they can live more normal lives.
When I reach Cathleen Cox, research director at the Los Angeles Zoo, she
listens when I read her the conclusion of Stanford's book. She asks me to
back up and read the paragraphs again in which Stanford calls keeping
great apes in zoos "ethically questionable."</TE>
<TE>   Cox was instrumental in designing the Mahale Mountain enclosure,
pressing hard to build and maintain an exhibit that provides naturalistic
stimulation for the apes. Recent studies of their social behavior
informed its architecture. The chimps are kept in a fairly large group
and they've been allowed to raise several infants, which Cox thinks will
prove key to their ability to "experience a joyful, fulfilling life."</TE>
<TE>   She explains the prime reasons for keeping well-designed enclosures
like hers open. There's tremendous education potential, she says, and as
a result of seeing great apes in the zoo, people may learn and act on a
new sense of connection with chimpanzees.</TE>
<TE>   Her argument draws support from a somewhat surprising source: Jane
Goodall. "There's always the gray area," Goodall says when I track her
down between speaking engagements in Washington, D.C. "And here the gray
area is the terrible plight of chimpanzees in Africa." Goodall agrees
with Stanford's comments about the immorality of biomedical research on
great apes and shares his qualms about Povinelli's proposed project. But
she bristles at the notion that these positions should be based on his
underlying assumption. "What I particularly hate is comparing chimpanzee
intellect to a small human child or a mentally impaired adult. They're
way above a 2-year-old child--in the way they can plan for the immediate
future, in the way they quickly adjust to the arrival of a new guy in the
group who happens to be higher ranking than they are. No 2-year-old child
could do anything like that, nor could a mentally disturbed adult."</TE>
<TE>   Cox offers no opinion about the difference between chimp and human
cognition, relying instead on reports of the plight of wild great apes.
Since they're threatened in the wild all over the world, Cox suggests,
perhaps captive animals should be valued as the keepers of precious
"genetic material." If they're wiped out in Africa, future generations of
Jerrard's offspring one day might be used to repopulate the wild.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like that argument. It's too fatalistic," Stanford replies.
"It's like saying, 'If I put you in a cell, you're not going to get hit
by an automobile.' "</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he says, a new international campaign to protect great ape
home ranges is needed. As for the argument that zoos contribute, directly
and indirectly, to conservation efforts, the Los Angeles Zoo makes little
direct contribution to conservation efforts aimed at great apes in the
wild. The Mahale Mountain exhibit, in other words, isn't used as a
vehicle for keeping the real Mahale Mountain chimpanzees alive.</TE>
<TE>   Cox is searching for common ground. "Craig is right on in a way. It is
morally questionable to do this work. As you confront the [ethical]
question, it ought to move you in the direction of really being sure that
you're protecting them and ensuring the most satisfying life they can
possibly have."</TE>
<TE>   Judeo, the wizened older male at the Mahale Mountain enclosure, sports
a white goatee, a broad chest and a domineering manner that dares you to
question who's in charge. Galloping across the grass on all fours, he
clambers up the rocks and then rises fully upright, looking as if he
intends to spoof that timeworn illustration about evolution that begins
with a monkey and gives rise to a man.</TE>
<TE>   Even if you didn't know that Judeo is a close genetic match for me,
our DNA overlapping by more than 98%, going to the railing for a closer
look is like observing oneself in a fun-house mirror. There's the initial
shock of recognition that primate researchers always mention. But
sometimes, too, there's a powerful crosscurrent, a kind of visceral
shock, even revulsion. Judeo's eyes are bright, his brow furled in a
familiar way, his mouth upturned in what looks like a malevolent grin.
Get a load of that gaping mouth, pink gums and sharp canines. His chest
is a fireplug of muscles, like the torso of a dwarf bodybuilder. His long
arms stretch down past stumpy legs.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps such push-pull reactions explain why apes and monkeys were
used for centuries as symbols of the impulsive or demonic side of human
nature. Maybe this deep ambiguity even underpins the tendency of some to
see the connection between apes and humans as a lightly graded continuum
and others, studying the same animals, to highlight vast differences.</TE>
<TE>   The two Stanfords, one a lively miniature of the other, wander off to
look at hippos and giraffes. Along wide concrete walkways on our way back
to the zoo entrance, volunteers have brought various other animals out to
allow visitors a closer look. We stop to check them out. An attendant
offers a bulbous boa constrictor as thick as your wrist for patrons to
touch. When it moves, rippling its muscles, the snake's body shimmers.
Adam hesitates, but only for a beat before running his open hand along
the leathery snakeskin.</TE>
<TE>   I watch over his shoulder, studying Adam as he scopes out the boa
constrictor. He looks up shyly. But he doesn't try shimmying his own
body, doesn't stroke his own skin, aping the snake as he'd done an hour
before with Jerrard. Adam doesn't lie down on the ground to mimic the
snake's slithering. Neither does he turn back, to me or to his father, to
say with quiet authority: "You know, we are a snake."</TE>

<HD>The Disaffection of Tammy Bruce</HD>
<DH>Once a Leader in the National Organization for Women and a Voice
for Gay-Lesbian Rights, Today the Former Talk-Show Host Is Politically
Homeless--Though You Wouldn't Know It From the Hugs She's Giving David
Horowitz, Larry Elder and Other Conservatives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED DICKEY</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Had Tammy Bruce been with Sherman on his march, it would have been
Georgians, not the general, who would have said, "War is hell." As former
head of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Organization for Women,
Bruce was a true believer who spent the first half of the '90s raising
hell locally and nationally. She organized the marches, licked the stamps
and harangued the politicians for women's and gay rights. She was a media
personality whose outspoken views were broadcast widely on a talk show on
L.A. station KFI, one of the few radio commentators representing the
progressive movement.</LD>
<LD>   Her most notable undertaking was in trying to make life miserable for
O.J. Simpson following his 1995 acquittal. Bruce and her followers kicked
up clouds of media dust with condemnations that loudly named Simpson the
archvillain of domestic violence because he had abused his murdered
ex-wife, Nicole.</LD>
<LD>   Today, Bruce stands on the outside, fired from her radio job, a
non-person to the NOW power structure and in some gay-lesbian activist
circles, close to being labeled a racist, even--this is the cruelest
cut--a conservative. What changed? Not her, she says.</LD>
<TE>   Tammy Bruce blends into the smart-set camouflage of the mid-Wilshire
neighborhood where she shares a two-bedroom apartment with a roommate.
She is 39, slim and mod, and she worries about her weight. She is also a
penny-pinching May graduate from USC, where she was on full scholarship
while earning her B.A. in political science.</TE>
<TE>   Seems strange that this well-known activist is just getting her degree
at a time when some of her peers are starting to check 401(k)s and
thinking of early retirement. That's because she entered life's race from
a standing start--she grew up poor, a "Northridge street kid," a girl who
never knew her father and seldom saw her mom. Her mother, now deceased,
worked as a store  clerk, and dad was . . . somewhere. She never saw his
face and doesn't even know his name. If she had gotten into drugs at 15
and become a wasted life at 18, no social worker would have blinked.
However, what saved her was a quick mind and strong constitution. So, in
1990, as a proud lesbian in her late 20s, she emerged from a series of
minor public relations jobs to become perhaps the highest-profile woman
in L.A., if only for a brief time.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Saturday evening, Bruce drives north on the Pacific Coast
Highway, headed to the Malibu home of neoconservative activist and writer
David Horowitz. He is a man just as flinty-eyed for his cause as she ever
was for hers. Nestled in her bag is a gift-wrapped Waterford pen for
Horowitz, who is celebrating his 63rd birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Horowitz has met her only twice, but he greets her as though she were
the only surviving Goldwater voter. He accepts the gift and hugs her. In
years past, these two would have frisked each other before shaking hands,
but it's different tonight. The reason is Bruce's recently published
book, which gives calamitous voice to her smoldering grievances with the
"New Left," as she characterizes the feminist, gay and black civil rights
organizations with which she is now feuding.</TE>
<TE>   Her conflicts arose from her vociferous opinion about Simpson, then
culminated with her defense of talk-show host Dr. Laura Schlessinger when
the psychologist was attacked for allegedly being a homophobe. Bruce's
book, "The New Thought Police," has left many of her former liberal
cohorts gasping and fuming. Bruce is at Horowitz's tonight to check out
the other side, to test the truth of the old saying: The enemy of my
enemy is my friend. She's also trying to fill a void. "Because I never
had a father, I guess I'm always looking for family, wanting to find
where I belong. Is that a weakness? I believe I'm destined to be alone
politically, but I keep hoping there's someplace where there can be
differences without it being dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   Horowitz's airy living room is windowed for the ocean view, and it's
starting to fill up with what will become a group of about 40. Bruce soon
encounters KABC talk-show host Larry Elder, a libertarian black man known
to have his own group-identity spats. He is friendly, bright and at ease
here. When he sees Bruce, whom he has met before, he smiles. He busses
her on the cheek, then says impishly, "Girl, give me one night--just one
night--and I'll turn you around."</TE>
<TE>   Bruce smiles and blushes. "What do I tell my girlfriend?" she asks, a
little at a loss for words.</TE>
<TE>   This is a heaven-sent response for the quick-witted Elder. "Bring her
along!" he says, with a booming laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Two or three people are idly listening. Joking or not, if this were
most feminist or gay groups, Elder would have just committed a gross
impropriety. These listeners, however, chuckle without taking offense and
meander toward the food table.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce and Elder argue lightly about a political point of little
consequence. She finally moves toward other people, doing the party
thing. These are political junkies. There is no aimless chatter about how
the Dodgers will do this year and isn't the sunset pretty?
Psychotherapist Palma Morgan approaches. "I'm a conservative, but I just
want you to know how much I admire you as a strong, open woman," she
says, then asks, "Can I get a hug?"</TE>
<TE>   Later, Bruce is looking over her napkin-wrapped glass at David Dreier,
a conservative Republican congressman from San Dimas. Their conversation
morphs into an easy discussion of American attitudes on the gay movement.
Then Bruce bluntly offers an observation that makes Dreier blanch: "A
majority of gays, I believe, have their first sexual experience as a
minor with a gay adult, and almost every gay and lesbian knows that's
true. We need to be willing to address that."</TE>
<TE>   I am holding a tape recorder in front of Bruce, and I'm thinking: "Do
you have any idea how this will look in print?"</TE>
<TE>   Dreier, an unflappable politician, switches the topic smoothly, as if
Bruce hasn't just revealed the topography of her public career. Her
landscape is marred by one obstruction, and it bears the name Candor.
This is a woman who does not seek to shock, outrage, or even convert. She
simply has a visceral need to speak her mind. Not rudely, but plainly,
and the trouble it has caused her is a reminder of why more cautious
public figures trust plain talk about as much as a grouchy Rottweiler. It
also explains why she ardently believes that oppressive "political
correctness" of the left threatens the goals of feminists and gays.</TE>
<TE>   What happened to so disillusion one of Los Angeles' most strident
left-wingers that she is flirting with her erstwhile opposites? The
reason may  lie in changes in American politics. It used to be the
differences between conservative and liberal were determined by
definitive policy issues: minimum  wage, the size of government, welfare,
foreign aid. Today, the parties still clash, but they fight mainly to see
who can best straddle the middle. Most political  street brawling is done
by pressure groups and single-cause activists. And it  can get rough.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce's first problem roiled up in 1995, during her sixth year as
president of the Los Angeles chapter of NOW. When the Simpson trial ended
that October, she saw a chance to redirect the anger against him to
awareness about domestic violence. Her press releases, vigils and marches
generated national attention, but also indignant resistance from an
unexpected source--her own organization. It led to her being denounced
and ostracized by the national NOW leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Ireland sighs wearily over the telephone at the mention of
Bruce's name. Ireland, a Washington, D.C., lawyer and former national NOW
president, says the organization became angry with Bruce after black
women and civil rights groups had objected to a feminist leader focusing
on violence against women while minimizing the issue of race. NOW's
national board censured Bruce in December, 1995, citing her for making
racially insensitive statements.</TE>
<TE>   "People were upset because they had worked to rid themselves of the
image of being a white women's group who cared only about white women's
issues," Ireland says. In a resolution that December, the group said,
"NOW recognizes that women of color are often put in the unfair position
of being told to choose between their allegiance to their communities of
color or to the feminist community."</TE>
<TE>   The discomfort over race at NOW made sense to Elaine Lafferty, who
covered the dispute for Time magazine. "For a white organization, the
charge of racism is paralyzing," Lafferty says. "They will do almost
anything to avoid that. Also, NOW at that time had the mentality--'All in
favor, say "aye;" all opposed, say "goodbye." ' "</TE>
<TE>   It didn't help that the problem, from NOW's perspective, was a family
fight that became public. "That makes it worse because of the
embarrassment," says Libertarian lesbian columnist Norah Vincent. "Then
it becomes betrayal, because she was both a feminist and a lesbian. When
your opponent is from within, that's an incredible threat."</TE>
<TE>   Bruce doesn't deny that she brushed aside racial factors during the
O.J. fight. "Race issues are not at the very top of my list. What I worry
about are women. That's what makes me a feminist. There are a number of
organizations worrying about black men, and there should be. However, I'm
not going to apologize for my focus, any more than the NAACP is going to
apologize for not being more feminist."</TE>
<TE>   She rolls her eyes when asked about the clashing allegiances felt by
black women at the time. "What part of feminism clashes with 'communities
of color'? That is just so patronizing. I'm sure the typical black or
Latino woman on the street would agree that she needs control over her
body, to earn a fair living and not to be physically abused."</TE>
<TE>   Even if Bruce and NOW saw those issues the same way, however, friction
would be inevitable, because the differences in style are vast. If Bruce
were in the Mafia, she'd be assigned all the hits. When she commits to a
cause, she rides it full speed over rough ground. But the hierarchy of
NOW prides itself on harnessed and strategic pacing. "Tammy takes it to
the extreme," says longtime Los Angeles feminist and lesbian activist
Robin Tyler. "Whenever there's a problem, she looks for an extreme
solution."</TE>
<TE>   It's a trait that her former colleague at KFI, Bill Handel, himself an
on-air tongue-lashing ready to happen, says is "probably why she was such
a good radio personality." But it's also one that makes the comfort index
plunge, along with job security. As Vincent says, Bruce is not one "to
tiptoe around, and that can always bite you in the butt, as it did her."</TE>
<TE>   Ireland says simply that Bruce "is not constituted to work in an
organization. She's a lone ranger. I think she is, at the core, a good
person, but I also think she's a wild woman."</TE>
<TE>   To which Bruce snorts and answers, "What NOW needs is more wild women
and fewer lawyers."</TE>
<TE>   Other differences in style were at work, too, ones that were more
subtle if equally important. Richard Dekmejian, a professor of political
science at USC who knows Bruce well and finds her brilliant--"PhD
quality"--says she doesn't fit the stylistic mold of many refined
activists. "Have you noticed? She's always wearing blue jeans," he says.
"The elite in her organization are far more fashionably dressed.</TE>
<TE>   "She fits the 'marginal man' theory: a person who is not of the
mainstream of whatever culture he's a part of," Dekmejian continues. "In
a lot of ways--social background, family, schooling--for a white person,
she's as declasse as you can think of. That made her vulnerable, and 'not
really one of us.' "</TE>
<TE>   Bruce parted with the left again when she defended radio talk-show
host Dr. Laura Schlessinger against attack by feminists and activist
gays, especially the national Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation. They accused Schlessinger of making homophobic statements on
her popular show and launched a successful campaign to force cancellation
of her new television program. Bruce rallied behind Schlessinger, despite
their vastly different political views. She accused Schlessinger's
opponents of taking protest beyond acceptable limits by trying to inhibit
her ability to make a living.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce's own radio career exploded in 1998 following another accusation
of racial insensitivity. After Ennis Cosby, the son of entertainer Bill
Cosby, was murdered by a Ukrainian immigrant in a Westside neighborhood
while standing alongside his Mercedes, his mother, Camille Cosby, wrote
an opinion piece in USA Today headlined, "America taught my son's killer
to hate blacks." Bruce was offended that a woman of great wealth would
accuse the whole nation of racism, and she upbraided Cosby on her
program. Bruce's point was that "she was tired of black America crying
racism every time something goes wrong," says Jill Stewart, a columnist
for the New Times in Los Angeles. "But to say that is completely against
leftist orthodoxy."</TE>
<TE>   But Bruce couldn't stop there. She also threw in gratuitous remarks
about Bill Cosby's alleged infidelity. The station made an apology on air
that was not delivered by Bruce. In fact, she never went on the air again
at the station.</TE>
<TE>   When discussing the public issues that have dominated her life,
Bruce's mind becomes a high-torque engine. When it's in gear, she hears
only the chugging of pistons and pushes all else aside. So late on a day
when she's in a car, heavy into conversation, and it becomes time to eat,
her idea is, "Fine. Here's  a Shakey's." Once settled into the wooden
booth, she barely glances at a slice  of pepperoni next to her salad. She
resents implications that she is a traitor and insists that her
progressive credentials are quite in order. She lists  the things she
believes in--and they are virtually identical to the positions of the
progressive feminists and gays she is on the outs with. So why isn't a
reconciliation possible?</TE>
<TE>   "Because they've turned our revolution into their own posh jobs. NOW,
especially, has become a bureaucracy with hardening of the arteries. When
you occupy a suite of offices in Washington for year after year, you lose
sight of the grass roots. You find local activism threatening because
it's so different from your own protected world."</TE>
<TE>   Bruce finishes the pizza slice and eyes a second, but keeps talking.
"The status quo becomes important because you are the status. It's all
about who you associate with, because that sends the message of who you
are or are not. It's a matter of who you have cocktails with." She grins.
"I don't drink very often, which probably explains why I'm in trouble so
much."</TE>
<TE>   She believes that progressive groups underestimate the willingness of
most people to support the aims of women and gays. "Americans are
sensitive to fairness, but they want to be sold by someone who reaches
out to them. NOW uses the right words of inclusion, but the body language
is one of distrust for 'outsiders.' Many of them think traditional white
males are eye-level to an earthworm."</TE>
<TE>   Bruce believes gays need to communicate that they are mainly
"two-car-garage folks." As clear as she is about her politics, romance
has played hide-and-seek with her, and she is currently unattached. One
relationship years ago ended with the suicide of her partner, and when
she was fired by KFI, she was also dumped by the woman with whom she was
living. (My fault, she says with a rueful laugh, "for choosing badly.")</TE>
<TE>   She surrenders to the second piece of pizza, then turns the subject to
her favorite demon. Those who remember her radio show would recognize how
her voice cracks slightly as it rises. "The left is in control of our
political culture. They have thoroughly intimidated the media. As a gay
woman, I'm pleased that Ellen had a TV show, but you'll absolutely never
see a TV show about a woman who's an anti-abortion Christian. It will not
happen, even though there are more of those people in the country than
gay people."</TE>
<TE>   She pauses and chuckles. "Of course, I wouldn't watch it." The smile
abruptly disappears. "Political correctness is just another form of
fundamentalism. NOW and some of the New Left have become intolerant and
bullying enough to drive Jerry Falwell back to bigotry school."</TE>
<TE>   Bruce has been largely ignored by the left since losing her platforms
at KFI and with NOW, but mention her beliefs in those political circles
and it's clear she remains an irritant. Liberal columnist Robert Scheer
says of Bruce's complaints: "The PC charge is the neoconservatives' way
of intimidating people from making fair and legitimate criticisms. "What
is this 'New Left,' anyway?" Scheer continues. "Do they meet on
Thursdays? I can't remember the last time I met someone on the left who
wanted to curtail debate. If her original argument was that there was a
double standard about O.J., then that's valid for her. But to extrapolate
from that to this whole, broad, sweeping critique, I think is silly."</TE>
<TE>   Bruce realizes she is persona non grata to liberal groups, and every
time she looks at her checkbook, she realizes she has paid a price. She's
starting a second book about moral relativism, and she wants to get back
into talk radio or  TV commentary. But what if that doesn't work? She's
just graduated from college, she's nearing middle age, she's still
searching for her place in the world. But  she's adamant that she's not
interested in signing up for any special interest  group or political
party. "The last thing a pressure group needs is an independent thinker,"
she says, her soprano voice rising. "They wouldn't want me, and I no
longer need them."</TE>
<TE>   What she does know, she says, is what she believes: "I am what
feminism set out to achieve. I'm an independent gay woman who acts and
thinks for herself, and--Lord knows--speaks her mind. I believe that what
I am is OK, even though it may be different from you. All I want is for
us to be free to talk about it, and maybe even argue about it."</TE>

<HD>The Importance of Seeming Human</HD>
<DH>Maybe Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel Really Are Sorry That Their
Dog Killed Their Neighbor. But 'Maybe' Wasn't Enough to Keep a Jury From
Going for Murder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 3 a.m. on Feb. 8, 2001, Marjorie Knoller and her husband, Robert
Noel, got out of bed so they'd be on time for their scheduled appearance
on "Good Morning America." They wanted to correct what they considered
the "grotesque and negative" image they'd developed in the media since
Jan. 26, when their large Presa Canario dogs, Bane and Hera, got away
from Knoller in the hallway of their San Francisco apartment building and
one of them mauled neighbor Diane Whipple to death.</LD>
<LD>   In this TV interview, the importance of seeming human was never more
evident. As Knoller and Noel would learn a year later, their icy
performance in front of an estimated 4.7 million viewers would play a
pivotal role in their fates.</LD>
<LD>   The interview offered the couple an opportunity to show remorse, to
extend heartfelt condolences to Whipple's loved ones and to explain how
emotionally wrecked they were by thoughts that their dog Bane had killed
Whipple in the most savage way imaginable. It also offered them the
chance to emotionally connect with the millions of American dog owners
who might empathize with two people whose pet inexplicably became a
killer.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, Knoller and Noel, both attorneys, "got into their fight
mode," says Karen Fleming, a Sacramento jury consultant who would later
help the couple select jurors. They smirked, denied, rolled their eyes,
evaded and, by implication, accused Whipple of playing a role in her own
mauling death. They came off as, at best, arrogant, unapologetic and
seemingly unmoved by the tragedy. Perhaps the most damning exchange came
when the increasingly incredulous interviewer, Elizabeth Vargas, asked
Knoller, "Do you think you bear any responsibility at all for this
attack?"</TE>
<TE>   Knoller: "Responsibility? No, not at all."</TE>
<TE>   Vargas: "Why not?. . . You were unable to control them. Why aren't you
at all responsible?"</TE>
<TE>   Knoller: "I wouldn't say I was unable to control them."</TE>
<TE>   Vargas: "You couldn't stop the dog from attacking Diane Whipple."</TE>
<TE>   Knoller: "I wouldn't say that it was an attack, and I did everything
humanly possible to avoid the incident. Ms. Whipple had ample opportunity
to move into her apartment. . . . She was in her apartment. She could
have just slammed the door shut. I would have."</TE>
<TE>   Knoller depicted Bane's initial charge at Whipple as "showing
interest," not  an aggressive act. When the 120-pound dog pinned the
110-pound Whipple against the wall and Knoller climbed on top of Whipple
to protect her, she still insisted Bane was just "showing interest."
Knoller said it only became an attack after Whipple struck her in the eye
during the incident, provoking Bane into a protective frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   Noel, his downturned mustache creating an indelible scowl, insisted
that Bane and Hera were not dangerous. Asked to explain reports from
dozens of people about frightening encounters with the two dogs, Noel
reacted with a scoff. Knoller, who seldom made eye contact with the
camera, defiantly dismissed the reports as a "total fabrication" by
people wanting "their 15 minutes of fame."</TE>
<TE>   Even when that videotape was played for jurors at their March trial,
effectively assuring Knoller's conviction on the harshest possible
charge, it still seemed unclear to Knoller why she might better have
stayed in bed on that unforgettable February morning.</TE>
<TE>   The "Good Morning America" interview had created enough public
distaste for the couple in the Bay Area that their trial was moved to Los
Angeles. Here, prosecutors introduced the ABC videotape as evidence that
helped undermine the couple's credibility and crystallize their images as
insincere, selfish and emotionally ignorant.</TE>
<TE>   It worked. The jurors--10 of whom owned or once owned dogs, including
one who said he was fond of pit bulls, Dobermans and
Rottweilers--considered four weeks of testimony involving five charges
against the two defendants. But despite being asked to untangle the
case's confusing and nuanced legal issues, they took only 11 hours to
deliberate and convict the couple on all counts. Clearly, the jurors
didn't much like these people.</TE>
<TE>   They convicted Knoller of not one, but two homicide counts:
second-degree murder--"implied malice murder"--and involuntary
manslaughter. They also convicted her of keeping a dangerous dog. Noel
wasn't even present during the attack, but was found guilty of the two
lesser offenses. The couple will be sentenced June 7, and San Francisco
County Superior Court Judge James Warren could send Knoller away for 15
years to life. Noel faces as many as four years.</TE>
<TE>   As they take the public stage again, Knoller and Noel are preceded by
an image as dour and unrepentant as any comic-book villain. The public
regards them with the contempt it normally reserves for the likes of
Osama bin Laden or the corporate hucksters at Enron. That passionate
reaction seems to affirm the theory that, at least in this case,
so-called "emotional intelligence" is no less important than being
genetically blessed with a high IQ.</TE>
<TE>   One of the theory's leading proponents, Dr. Daniel Goleman, the
Harvard-educated author of a 1995 bestseller on the subject, contends
that being emotionally savvy is critical in human relationships. To
acquire this "flair for living," Goleman says individuals must first
figure out what makes them tick, and then sharpen their feel for how
their words, mannerisms and emotions will affect others. They have to
tune in to how people respond to them, and, if necessary, adjust. People
without these emotional and social skills--or people who are oblivious to
their importance--come off as insensitive, arrogant and obnoxious.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors, of course, are only human. Dog-mauling murder cases are rare;
murder convictions even more rare. They are reserved for the worst of the
worst.</TE>
<TE>   By calling Knoller a second-degree murderer, the jury, in effect,
ranked her with the Ohio man who was convicted of murder because he
knocked his wife unconscious and sicced a pit bull on her.</TE>
<TE>   The "Good Morning America" interview was not the first time Knoller
and Noel seemed callous. They had been similarly defensive and accusatory
toward Whipple five days earlier in a press conference. Two weeks after
the ABC interview, they took their story to a grand jury with disastrous
results. Although prosecutors had asked the panel only for involuntary
manslaughter and mischievous dog indictments, the panel added the murder
count against Knoller.</TE>
<TE>   Even a hearing officer who had to decide whether Hera should be
destroyed found the defendants' testimony not credible and ordered the
dog killed--even though Hera did not initiate the attack and the dog's
participation was not definitively proven. Several months later, a poll
found 71% of Bay Area residents believed Knoller and Noel guilty. Letters
to the editor in the local papers were merciless. One correspondent
called them "rock-bottom pond scum."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the couple's most provocative statements eventually found
their way into the Los Angeles courtroom. The most damaging, jurors said
after trial, was the ABC interview. They replayed the tape several times
in the jury room.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no kind of sympathy, no kind of apologies," one juror
observed. "It helped us a lot." He added: "We didn't go into this
deciding we would hate these people." Still, the videotape was the
backdrop when Knoller testified. By then, she seemed to understand what
people needed to hear. She told how Bane, her "gentle and loving" pet,
turned into an unrecognizable monster when he spied Whipple. Bane
charged, pulling Knoller off her feet and dragging her flat on her
stomach as she clung to his leash. He leaped up in front of Whipple,
putting his paws on either side of her against the wall. When the dog got
down, Knoller pushed Whipple into her apartment, and Bane either jumped
on or pushed the two women to the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller said she pulled the leash with all her strength. She
repeatedly commanded the dog to stop, but Bane ignored her and began
ripping away Whipple's clothing and tearing into her body from the neck
down to her feet. She said Whipple was mostly silent as Knoller screamed
at Bane and pounded on him. She threw her body over Whipple, drenching
herself from head to toe in the dying woman's blood. Knoller said she
fought to exhaustion, but nothing worked.</TE>
<TE>   Sobbing hysterically and at one point screaming out her testimony,
Knoller said: "Every time I think it would be over and I could get him
away from her and get him the hell out of there, it would get worse and
it would start all over, and it just got worse and worse and worse and
worse. . . . Anything I was trying to do, he just wouldn't stop. He
wouldn't listen. He just wouldn't respond. He just wouldn't stop what he
was doing."</TE>
<TE>   Knoller's courtroom story, now carefully guided by her lawyer, was
shorn of defiance and implications that Whipple's actions had somehow
aggravated the attack. She offered tearful condolences to the family and
told how sorry she was about the horrible way Whipple died. But her words
came too late. For the jury, there was no way to reconcile this
emotional, remorseful woman with the cold, defiant and defensive woman
they saw on the tape. Which was the real Marjorie Knoller?</TE>
<TE>   On verdict day, Knoller sat at the defense table wearing what appeared
to be the same light-blue coat she wore on ABC. She closed her eyes,
furrowed her brow and clinched her mouth as the clerk read the verdict:
"We the jury, in the above entitled action, find the defendant, Marjorie
Knoller, guilty of the crime of second-degree murder." Knoller opened her
eyes as if in utter disbelief. She gasped for breath and began to cry.
Her mouth became a grimace. Moments later, Knoller scanned the audience
to find her parents. She mouthed a single word.</TE>
<TE>   "Help."</TE>

<HD>How a Similar Attack Led to a Different Verdict</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Marjorie Knoller's second-degree murder conviction is the first for
a dog mauling  in California. A few other dog owners have been charged
with murder, but the juries in those cases opted for lesser offenses even
when some defendants' handling of their dogs appeared no worse than
Knoller's.</LD>
<LD>   In a Barstow case last year, a man who admitted to police that he was
afraid of the pit bull under his care unchained the dog and took a nap.
While he snoozed, the dog attacked and killed an 11-year-old boy.</LD>
<LD>   The defense attorney, Robert O'Connor of Hesperia, says the boy had a
history of torturing animals, but unlike Knoller and Noel, O'Connor
sensed how the public and a jury would react if he started slamming the
victim. So he didn't do it.</LD>
<TE>   "Jurors don't want to see the victim victimized again," he says,
adding that his client was emotionally crushed by what happened to the
boy. In interviews with police, O'Connor says his client presented
himself well, and in court, "He was connecting with the jury." That jury
deliberated three days before opting to convict his client of involuntary
manslaughter instead of second-degree murder. He was sentenced last
spring to three years and is expected to be free by year's end.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When I discovered that i was pregnant last year, my friend Joy gave
me a copy of "The Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy," Vicki Iovine's
mega-selling dish on what to really expect when you're expecting. Since I
hadn't had any morning sickness, bouts of exhaustion or constipation--or
married a knuckle-dragger who could barely grunt out any understanding of
my miraculous growing body (apparently a common problem in the Malibu
author's circle)--I skipped ahead to the chapter that addressed my
immediate concern: Looking the Best You Can. It offered practical
information about maternity clothes, but when I got to the part about
stirrup pants being her big "fashion secret" for covering up fat ankles,
I experienced my first wave of nausea. This from a woman who's married to
the record producer who signed Marilyn Manson? Obviously I'd have to
crack the code myself.</LD>
<TE>   My first discovery: Anyone who's anyone who's pregnant in L.A. does
prenatal yoga at Golden Bridge with the luminescent Gurmukh. Not only is
the energy generated by 50 chanting mamas incredible, it's also the best
place in town to see what pregnant women really look like. Some women
come to class in labor and they're barely showing; others are so big at
six months that they simply cannot get any bigger--then they do. Even
among women at the same stage of pregnancy, the variety is impressive.
But here's one thing they have in common: Nobody's trying to hide their
fat ankles under an '80s fashion nightmare. The studio is often full of
women of all sizes wearing snug baby-Ts and regular drawstring yoga pants
slung low below a belly decorated with a swirl of crystal appliques. The
style is about celebrating the voluptuousness of motherhood.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it's one thing to let it all hang out and wear your
too-tight pre-pregnancy clothes to yoga, and another thing to wear them
to lunch at The Grill. But that's the beauty of being with child in Los
Angeles: Short, tight and belly-baring is the city's latest look in
maternity fashion. What a relief to find out that I could waddle around
with my shirt hiked up and my pants pulled down and be at fashion's
cutting edge. It's like the newest version of the "I'm Not Fat, I'm
Pregnant" T-shirt.</TE>
<TE>   These days, maternity clothes are contemporary and fitted, thanks in
large part to the availability of stretch-cotton fabrics. Pants with a
front elastic panel sewn into an otherwise inelastic fabric are pretty
much history, as are the dopey tents with neck and arm holes designed to
conceal a pregnancy. The styles at mainstream outlets such as Motherhood
Maternity and Gap Maternity (available online only) and Target's In Due
Time line are cute, affordable and cut to highlight the ever-growing
mystical pod. But there's nothing risky about these collections, which
still feature tops that hit below the hip and cover the belly.</TE>
<TE>   But boutiques such as Naissance on Melrose (NOM) tell a different L.A.
story. Their motto: Stylish. Sexy. Pregnant. A maternity boutique that
also offers nursery furniture and custom bedding upstairs, it has
original designs on par with the whole groovy Melrose scene, and prices
to match. Until recently, they had an outlet in Calabasas where I picked
up some of the same pieces at a deep discount. It's where I bought the
prized items of my maternity wardrobe: a fuzzy, cleavage-accentuating
pink sweater with red ribbon ties at the elbows and a scoop neckline, and
a stretch-corduroy pencil skirt with silver studs down the sides and a
fringe hem. Unfortunately, I had no idea how roasting hot I would be
throughout my pregnancy, making it nearly impossible to wear the sweater
even in the dead of a Los Angeles winter.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese Weekend--recently opened at the Paseo Colorado in
Pasadena--is another favorite, offering a complete line of fitted
maternity and nursing wear, including the basics, evening wear, swimwear
and a great selection of underwear and lingerie. Pants, skirts and shorts
are cut in their signature hip-hugger style; a wide elastic-fabric band
shows off the belly and helps support the lower back. Beautiful
stretch-knit fabrics highlight the new curves, and they're also doing
some really cool stuff with faux suede.</TE>
<TE>   As with any kind of radical chic, there are a few things to keep in
mind.</TE>
<TE>   One: Not everyone will approve. Strangers often gave me critical looks
whenever I exposed my still-an-innie navel. When my 75-year-old mother
came to visit from Chicago, she kept trying to pull my shirt down and was
in a serious panic over my outfit for the baby shower. "You're not going
to have a bare belly are you? Are you?" she asked repeatedly. After all
the crazy, unconventional and downright deviant things I've done in my
life, this is what she decides to pick as her big morality crusade? Chalk
it up to a different generation. After all, in the decades when my mother
was pregnant, you couldn't even say the word in an American feature film
or on television, much less show a visibly pregnant woman on screen, even
if she was wearing Balenciaga.</TE>
<TE>   Two: Expect annoying comments on your size. Though I was carrying the
baby "all in front," as they say, I believe I received so many
unsolicited observations because I wore fitted clothes--and most people
think that when your clothes are that tight you must be ready to pop.</TE>
<TE>   Three: In the third trimester, you may want to wear a tent. Really.
The truth is, all of the great clothes are made for the second
trimester--when you're far enough along to visibly celebrate your
pregnancy, but not so far along that you need a bib when you're eating
because you can't get within three feet of the table and food keeps
falling on your shirt because your lap has disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   In the final weeks of my pregnancy, I had outgrown nearly all of my
funky maternity clothes, and I couldn't stand the idea of wearing
anything tight, especially polyester. I wanted the loose cotton, billowy
goddess look and was ready to pay top dollar for it. Inside the high-end
A Pea in the Pod in Beverly Hills, the walls are decorated with glamorous
photos of semi-celebrities doing the sexy, belly-baring thing: Eddie
Murphy's wife; Vanna White; Mrs. Larry King, etc. Not a good sign. "Do
you have any of those old-fashioned pregnancy tents?" I asked the
salesperson. She burst out laughing, but I wasn't kidding. With Miss
Manners etiquette, she suggested that I might want something below the
knee because, well, at a certain point it becomes impossible to sit with
your legs closed, making short hemlines impractical. I graciously tried
on every item she brought into the dressing room, though nothing was
billowy and nothing fit. I repeated the experience next door at the very
posh Liz Lange Maternity, where I was informed that "everything's very
fitted these days."</TE>
<TE>   I, who had always embraced my rapidly ripening body, was now on the
verge of tears. I'd never been shopping where everything in the store was
too small. It wasn't just the tight clothes that made me look so
gigantic: In the end, I weighed 194 pounds. I have a miracle happening
inside of me, I reminded myself. How dare I be so vain, so superficial,
so L.A.? Yet the reality is that it's hard to gain almost 60 pounds, and
even harder to do it in a city with the greatest concentration in the
world of hot babes in low-rise jeans.</TE>
<TE>   My salvation finally arrived in the form of an ugly purple size 20
muumuu from a Hollywood thrift store that cost me exactly $1--and even
that was hard to find. It was a hideous yet practical purchase: the
weather was hot, I was huge. But the more I thought about it, the more I
felt that a muumuu could actually be kind of cool, in a retro way, an
interpretation of geek chic for hip mamas. Accessorize with some jeweled
flip-flops, a tiki-hut bag and a pair of oversize pink sunglasses with
white plastic frames, and there you go: the next trend. See? This is the
beauty of being with child in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   On March 4, at 8:09 in the morning, I gave birth to a healthy and
perfectly average-size baby boy, Marson Peach Casimir Von Wilder Palac
Rice. It was, without question, the most amazing moment of my entire
life. So far, not a day has gone by without my looking into his blueberry
eyes and shedding tears of awe and gratitude over his very existence.</TE>
<TE>   These days, who needs street clothes? I spend most days hanging around
the house wearing the latest in fetish wear: a nursing bra that could fit
Divine underneath a "Daddy's Girl" T-shirt and, because of the Caesarean
birth, comfy granny panties that come up to my armpits. But it's a look I
wouldn't trade for anything in the world.</TE>

<DH>Stylist Dusty Atkins Decorates His Palm Springs Carriage House With
Graphic Juxtapositions and Flea Market Finds</DH>

<LD>For the past two decades, display designer Dusty Atkins has
delighted in creating striking visual images for windows at Gumps, Macy's
and Emporio Armani in San Francisco. "It's all about the juxtaposition of
objects," Atkins says. "It has to be graphic and eye-catching. You only
have a split second to capture someone's attention." For one store window
with the theme "Avant-Gardener," he used a rusted metal obelisk filled
with plastic watering cans, pink flamingos stuffed in a giant parrot cage
and antique urns holding children's pinwheels. "You know when you've hit
it when there is a marriage between the objects that makes each element
stronger." The same concept applies to his Palm Springs residence. Opting
to relocate to a warmer climate two years ago, Atkins bought a
Spanish-style 1930s carriage house in the Vista Santa Rosa district just
south of downtown Palm Springs. The tiny, 1,200-square-foot space is a
showcase for his creative display talents and graphic pairings. On a
glass table next to the bed in the guest bedroom, a pair of cactuses grow
out of a friend's old work boots. Sitting on a vintage tray near the
landing window, a glass laboratory bowl holds silver spheres topped with
a crown of thorns he fashioned from tree branches outside his window. The
whitewashed interior is decorated almost entirely with secondhand and
flea market furnishings. "I like old and crusty," says Atkins, who often
reworks the discarded pieces he finds. A case in point is a $5 secondhand
restaurant-supply table that sits on the tiny landing he uses as a
combined living and dining room at the top of the stairs. He wrapped the
table's pitted base in a stretchy white bathing suit material, then
painted and carved the Formica top to resemble wood. Two Queen Anne
chairs that he purchased for less than $100 for the pair at a San
Francisco estate sale accompany the table. In the guest bedroom, an
abandoned wing chair he found along a desert road takes on a sculptural
quality with its new coat of white shellac. "You can sit in it but I
prefer to look at it," says Atkins. "It's a piece with a past."</LD>
<TE>   Added to the interior's mix are the designer's quirky collections:
weathered tool chests, brooms  worn to the quick and old circus
mallets--"the kind the musclemen used." He explains, "Tools of manual
labor have always interested me as objects. They have an aura that speaks
to me and that I find very comforting. They have their own beauty."</TE>
<TE>   Though the designer occasionally misses San Francisco, ultimately he's
happier in his new digs. "I left good friends and great Chinese food, but
the quality of life in Palm Springs is so much better," he says. "And
it's warm here. I'm getting too old to be cold."</TE>

<HD>Quail Eggs--Gourmet Treat or Culinary Punch Line?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN HEROLD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One glimpse of the elegantly speckled shells at the Santa Monica
farmers market and I was 12 again, standing over a cast-iron pan, spatula
in hand to lift Lilliputian-size eggs onto a plate in front of an
unsuspecting friend, whose eyes popped out at what appeared to be
breakfast for leprechauns. My mother remembers, too, how I would hardboil
the tiny quail eggs from my backyard aviary and pull them out at school
at noon, delighted at the reaction from the other adolescent lunchers.</LD>
<LD>   But the eggs I was looking at now were from Lily's, a Santa
Barbara/Fillmore operation that has a stand at the Wednesday Santa Monica
farmers market. Quail eggs can also be found at specialty markets such as
Gelson's and in the gourmet food sections of chain markets such as
Ralphs. To anyone unacquainted with these diminutive ovoids (which taste
like a subtler version of chicken eggs), they probably appear charming
but puzzling. Just how long do you cook something that looks like it was
invented for Thumbelina?</LD>
<LD>   Alex Scrimgeour, the British-born chef at Alex in West Hollywood,
knows exactly how long. He, too, developed an affection for quail eggs as
a child, but in his case it was at London restaurants. They were a
delicacy to be taken seriously, like caviar and truffles, which probably
had something to do with the difficulty of finding them in the English
countryside.</LD>
<TE>   I had no difficulty procuring my eggs. They were laid with regularity
by a pair of quails I kept in a large outdoor aviary with two golden
pheasants, which did not lay eggs but shed incredibly beautiful feathers,
which I put into vases. As to the quail eggs, I hadn't a clue what to do
with them other than fry or hardboil them.</TE>
<TE>   Scrimgeour, however, uses them with alacrity. Lightly hardboiled, "a
minute or two, you don't want that layer of gray between the yolk and the
white," they are the stars of a salad Nicoise that is a particular
favorite with his diners. He poaches them for a mere 30 seconds in
appropriately small (3 1/2-ounce) copper pans and pairs them to great
effect with veal sweetbreads in another dish. Carefully fried in
clarified butter--"my staff hates when we do this, you have to get so
close to the grease when you break the eggs"--they are the signature
ingredient in an asparagus salad and also for an amuse bouche of potato
leek cake resting on a dab of creme fra'che and topped with smoked
salmon, the egg and a chervil dressing.</TE>
<TE>   While Scrimgeour gets his quail eggs from a vendor, he is entranced by
the idea of finding a source of free-range eggs. Perhaps the thought
takes him back to the verdant English countryside of his childhood. Me,
I'm back on a splintery bench at school, carefully peeling a
brown-speckled shell with a rapt young audience in attendance.</TE>
<TE>Quail Eggs Florentine</TE>
<TE>   Adapted by Santa Monica chef Evelyn Silvey</TE>
<TE>   Serves 4</TE>
<TE>   8 quail eggs</TE>
<TE>   2 6-ounce bags baby spinach, washed and stems removed</TE>
<TE>   4 slices white bread, crusts removed</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 tablespoons butter</TE>
<TE>   1/2 tablespoon olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon shallots, chopped fine</TE>
<TE>   Pinch of nutmeg</TE>
<TE>   Salt to taste</TE>
<TE>   White pepper to taste</TE>
<TE>Tomato and maui onion salsa</TE>
<TE>   1 tomato, diced</TE>
<TE>   1 small Maui onion or sweet onion, diced</TE>
<TE>   Salt and pepper to taste</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toast the 4 slices of bread in a toaster and butter them. Keep warm in
350-degree oven. In a 5-quart pan over medium heat, melt 1/2 tablespoon
butter with the olive oil. Add the shallots and cook until translucent,
about 1-2 minutes. Add the spinach and seasonings. Saute, stirring until
all of the spinach is cooked. Drain the spinach of any excess juices. Put
the spinach on the toast, forming a nest. Reserve in the oven. In a
nonstick saute pan over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter, add the
quail eggs and fry until done, about 30 seconds. Remove the nests from
the oven and place 2 eggs in each nest. Garnish with tomato and onion
salsa.</TE>

<HD>Puck's New Brasserie Is Strong on Enthusiasm but the Menu Is Still
Green</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Does Wolfgang Puck ever sleep? What with his Food Network show,
appearances on "Good Morning America," a new line of wood-fired pizzas
and a posse of restaurants from Los Angeles to Chicago and back, it's a
wonder that the ebullient Austrian-born chef ever gets in forty winks. A
friend once saw him at Spago on a Saturday night, then flew up to San
Francisco and decided to have breakfast at Postrio, Puck's San Francisco
restaurant. He arrived a few minutes too early. Guess who opened the
door? Wolfgang. It makes you wonder if he has cloned himself.</LD>
<LD>   You might wonder even more if you dropped into his latest restaurant:
Vert, billed as "a brasserie by Wolfgang Puck." There he is again,
remarkably youthful and fit. Look again. It's not Wolfgang at all, but
his younger brother, Klaus, who moved from Spago Chicago to manage the
new Hollywood restaurant in the Hollywood &amp; Highland complex.</LD>
<LD>   Next door is the Kodak Theatre, the new home of the Academy Awards.
Since Puck is the reigning chef for the event, the developers built him
an Olympic-size kitchen and gave him the option for even more space,
which, of course, he used for a restaurant. Instead of creating another
Spago or Wolfgang Puck Cafe, he turned to Spago executive chef Lee Hefter
and longtime chef de cuisine Matt Bencivenga and asked them to come up
with a concept.</LD>
<TE>   Vert--green in French--is it, giving them a chance to cook their
version of the casual French fare featured in the bustling brasseries of
Paris. They've mixed in some Italian and California-inspired dishes, all
at prices between those of Spago's and Wolfgang Puck's.</TE>
<TE>   The Puck machine knows how to make a space inviting. Part of it is the
openness and clarity of the design. Vert has a huge bar, back lit in red
and green lights, with a plasma television screen tuned to sports and a
bartender who can turn out cocktails double time.</TE>
<TE>   Vert looks onto the open courtyard, which is a big help in making this
restaurant-in-a-mall welcoming. At the back is the requisite open kitchen
and its wood-burning pizza oven. Curved quilted booths in a deep
turquoise are set off by ochre walls and Hockney-esque wall paintings.
Bread arrives in filigreed wire baskets. Shellfish and pizzas are served
on tall racks that elevate them above the table. All in all, Vert looks
the part of the Hollywood brasserie.</TE>
<TE>   Vert's signature drink is a pretty green Bellini made with prosecco
(Italian sparkling wine) and freshly pressed green apple juice. It trumps
a sour apple martini any day. If you're at Hollywood &amp; Highland to see a
performance or a movie, Vert is a great spot for a nosh and a drink. It
needn't be only a cocktail. The wine list is eclectic and interesting,
and the younger Puck often pours little-known wines by the glass, such as
a Huet Vouvray dry from the Loire Valley or a Gruner Veltliner from
Austria's Kamptal region.</TE>
<TE>   The bread basket is a nice touch: olive bread, focaccia, long
lasagna-wide ribbons of crisp bread with zigzag edges sprinkled with
seeds. You also get soft white goat cheese topped with tapenade and
Provencal herbs. The waiter pours olive oil over it to form a pool for
dipping. It's a delicious way to start.</TE>
<TE>   But the menu itself is very much a work in progress. First, the good
news. Fritto misto is terrific--deep-fried squid tentacles, tiny pink
shrimp, scallops, zucchini "fries," other vegetables and olives served
with a crock of aooli. Another good starter is steak tartare, which comes
already seasoned and with, inexplicably, a dab of aooli on the side. An
unconventional Caesar of radicchio and romaine benefits from a spunky
dressing and handmade croutons. Served in a bowl, it eschews the preened
restaurant look for a homemade aesthetic. Soupe au pistou is mostly beans
with a slew of minced vegetables, and the pistou (French for pesto) seems
to consist of basil oil swirled over a crouton smeared with ricotta.</TE>
<TE>   The chefs take the same liberties with pissaladiere and tarte flambee.
Instead of the usual Nicoise flatbread spread with tomato, caramelized
onions, olives and anchovies, theirs is ruined with a thick layer of
soft, slippery onions and a heavy crust. Tarte flambee is basically hold
the tomato, load on the onions and bacon. Whatever model they're working
from, it's not correct, and it just isn't very good.</TE>
<TE>   Pizza with potato, burrata and pancetta doesn't fare much better.
Large areas of the billowing dough have no topping at all, and where the
dough is garnished, it's sparse on the potatoes, and salty to boot.</TE>
<TE>   While several of the main courses are fine, the menu--and often the
cooking--is uneven. I enjoyed a veal New York steak heavily encrusted
with black peppercorns. The baby leeks on the side, however, were heavy
with oil. Irresistible shoestring fries showered with parsley come with a
dish of both ketchup and a silky bearnaise. Dover sole grenobloise,
sauced with brown butter and capers, is an ideal brasserie dish,
especially when the fish is as fresh as this one and the kitchen keeps
the preparation simple.</TE>
<TE>   But it's hard to fathom the idea behind the seared tuna, sliced and
still standing vertically, with some checcha and basil butter strewn over
the top. I like the idea of tuna and beans. However, the cannellini beans
are underdone and have little flavor. The tuna is delicious, though,
making the dish a near miss.</TE>
<TE>   Two large T-bone lamb chops arrive precariously vertical, and one of
my guests, busy talking, tries to cut into them until we remind her to
turn them on their side. What is the point? Though they're tender and
nicely cooked, you'd never be able to identify these chops as lamb if you
were blindfolded. It's generic meat.</TE>
<TE>   The kitchen's heavy hand with olive oil shows up again in the sauteed
escarole, something I normally love. More oil doesn't make a dish more
Italian or Provencal. Understated or graceful doesn't seem to be in the
cooks' vocabulary.</TE>
<TE>   The pork chop, for example is three fingers high, pink and juicy at
the center, but presentation is overwrought with buttery cabbage on the
bottom, sweet red onion marmalade on top and, if that's not enough, it
also has a mustard sauce. They do make a respectable steak frites using a
New York cut instead of the traditional hanger steak. Sometimes there's a
fine charcoal-grilled Porterhouse steak for two.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody can complain about the portions at Vert. Even the desserts are
humongous--a bracing tangerine sorbet is piled into a tuile cookie the
size of a coffee filter, for example. What more fitting end to a French
brasserie meal than a swirl of apple tart with vert apple ice cream
melting in the middle?</TE>
<TE>   While Vert may not yet be the brasserie it hopes to be, it has an
appealing energy and an enthusiastic staff. The kitchen keeps redefining
the menu, and little by little it's coming into focus. Think of it. You
could go to a movie or the theater and repair to Vert for something to
eat--without getting into your car again. That's a first for Hollywood.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dallas Desperados got some payback Saturday night, defeating the
Avengers, 62-55 in front of 12,309 at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   In the teams' last meeting May 4, Los Angeles eked out a 52-51
victory.</LD>
<LD>   After Dallas took the lead on Patrise Alexander's six-yard run
with 48 seconds left, the Avengers had two chances to tie it up, each
time with Chris Jackson just missing the catch.</LD>
<TE>   With 31 seconds left, quarterback Tony Graziani passed to an open
Jackson in the end zone, but Jackson had the ball go through his
hands. Then, with 16 seconds left, Jackson wasn't able to make the
grab again.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that it was Jackson's second game back after sitting out
because of a broken wrist wasn't the reason he missed.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very not like him," Avenger Coach Ed Hodgkiss said of
Jackson, who had two touchdown catches. "We have a lot of confidence
in him, and he's been our go-to guy. It's unfortunate that it
happened in that kind of situation."</TE>
<TE>   Greg Hopkins had four touchdown catches for the Avengers (4-3).
Dallas improved to 3-4.</TE>
<TE>   Graziani finished with 20 completions in 34 attempts and two
interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other games, San Jose defeated Buffalo, 63-35, to improve to
7-0; Georgia ended a five-game losing streak with a 49-34 victory
over Detroit; and Toronto defeated New York, 63-38.</TE>

<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Trainer Bobby Frankel, who had been undecided about Medaglia d'Oro
running in next Saturday's Belmont Stakes, said Saturday after a
five-furlong workout that the colt will be entered in the Triple
Crown finale.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Migliore, who rode Medaglia d'Oro at Belmont Park as he
finished the work in 1:002/5, is committed to Magic Weisner, the
Preakness runner-up, in the Belmont. Frankel suggested that he might
hire either Kent Desormeaux or Pat Valenzuela to ride in the Belmont.</LD>
<LD>   As the second choice in the Kentucky Derby, Medaglia d'Oro was
bumped leaving the gate and lost his chance at a forward position.
After finishing fourth, he went off the second choice in the
Preakness and finished a non-contending eighth.</LD>
<TE>   If 13 horses start in the 134th Belmont, it will be the biggest
field since Editor's Note beat 13 rivals in 1996. Besides War Emblem
and Medaglia d'Oro, others expected to run Saturday are Artax Too,
Essence Of Dubai, Like A Hero, Magic Weisner, Perfect Drift, Proud
Citizen, Puzzlement, Sarava, Sunday Break, Tracemark and Wiseman's
Ferry.</TE>
<TE>   Perfect Drift worked five furlongs Saturday in 1:001/5 at a
training center near Churchill Downs. The gelding will join War
Emblem and Proud Citizen on a plane from Louisville Wednesday that
will take the horses to New York. War Emblem, who galloped 11/2 miles
here Saturday, is scheduled for a three-furlong workout at Churchill
on Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>War Emblem Is Not a Nice Little Horse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>An instinctive trainer, Bob Baffert likes to take a horse by a lead
shank and walk it around the shedrow of the barn.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a way that I can tell where I am with a horse," Baffert
said. "I can gauge how a horse is feeling. When a horse is feeling
good, you can sense that, a lot like the tension a fisherman feels on
his line when he hooks something."</LD>
<LD>   In 1996, Baffert's baptismal year at the Kentucky Derby, he almost
won the race with Cavonnier, who was nosed out at the wire by
Grindstone. The week after the Derby, an injured Grindstone was
retired, leaving the Preakness, two weeks later, wide open for
Cavonnier, who went off favored at Pimlico.</LD>
<TE>   But a few days before the Preakness, Baffert grabbed Cavonnier by
the shank and felt all the wrong vibes.</TE>
<TE>   "He was walking around like a borrowed dog," Baffert said Friday
at Churchill Downs, where he's in the final stages of training War
Emblem for Saturday's Belmont Stakes and a possible sweep of the
Triple Crown.</TE>
<TE>   Cavonnier dropped into the Preakness with a thud, finishing
fourth. The winner, Louis Quatorze, beat him by more than eighth
lengths. Unfortunately, Baffert's lead-shank theory had held up.</TE>
<TE>   When Baffert takes hold of the fiery War Emblem's shank, he needs
a flak jacket and industrial-strength sunglasses. He doesn't call his
Kentucky Derby-Preakness winner Hannibal Lecter just to get a laugh.
War Emblem likes to bite other horses, people and any object that he
feels might get in his way.</TE>
<TE>   The morning after his Preakness victory two weeks ago, War Emblem
spotted a bale of hay in a corner of the barn. With several ominous
snorts, he lunged in front of Baffert, who was walking in front, and
sank his teeth into the bale and threw it to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a security guard nearby and he didn't know what to do,"
Baffert said. "He had probably never seen a horse act like that, and
he was totally shocked. You can never lower your guard with this
horse. And if he knows you're scared, he'll really take a shot."</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Springer, War Emblem's original trainer, told Baffert about
the colt's bellicose behavior shortly after the horse was sold, but
it was easy to believe that Springer might have been exaggerating. He
wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   Going into the Preakness, War Emblem was even sending a message to
rival horses that he was not to be messed with. Circling the shedrow
with Baffert one morning, the colt spotted Harlan's Holiday's hay net
hanging from the stall, and dived into the feed of the Florida
Derby-Blue Grass winner.</TE>
<TE>   "He moved so quickly that he knocked my glasses off and bent them
pretty good," Baffert said.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert is scheduled to marry Jill Moss, a former Louisville TV
newscaster, in August. Early on, Moss volunteered to see if she could
soften up War Emblem.</TE>
<TE>   "Jill's gotten him to like people a little bit more than when we
started," Baffert said.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after she was introduced to War Emblem, Moss turned to her
fiance and said, "Why is he so hateful?"</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," Baffert said. "Some really good horses can be that
way. Sunday Silence reared up one day and almost knocked out
[trainer] Charlie Whittingham."</TE>
<TE>   Moss tries to settle War Emblem with a steady ration of carrots
and peppermints.</TE>
<TE>   "When we first got him, he'd go to the track [in the morning] and
try to run off," Baffert said. "Getting him to relax has been the
toughest part. We keep trying to keep him from running off."</TE>
<TE>   In an equipment change, Baffert switched to a ring bit, which
gives War Emblem's rider more control when the horse threatens to
scamper. A tongue tie--a piece of cloth that keeps the tongue in
place--also has been added, and War Emblem is now outfitted with a
lip cord, a leather-protected chain that runs across his upper lip.</TE>
<TE>   "The cord has a tendency to keep him focused," Baffert said. "What
we're really trying to do is trick him. We don't want him running too
fast in the morning, that's how horses can get hurt. The cord puts
pressure on the lip. That's a very sensitive area and the cord
paralyzes him up there a little bit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like a mother grabbing one of her kids by the ear.
It gets their attention, and if he's worrying about that, he might
forget about doing something else."</TE>
<TE>   Before War Emblem was in his barn, Baffert was told that the horse
had problem ankles and at least one suspect knee. Baffert never
vetted the colt--he was visually satisfied with the horse--even
though an earlier exam by Elliott Walden, another trainer, had showed
bone chips in both of War Emblem's front ankles and another chip in a
knee.</TE>
<TE>   Other horsemen are surprised that War Emblem wasn't more
thoroughly inspected before Ahmed Salman, the Saudi Arabian prince,
spent $900,000 to buy him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been years since I bought a horse for any such price without
vetting him," trainer Wayne Lukas said. "But having said that, it's
not an exact science, and a lot of horses have had long careers after
vets have said they've only got one more race left in them. Charlie
Whittingham used to say, 'Don't take pictures, you might find
something.' [Wayne's son Jeff Lukas] had a great saying. He'd say
that chips bother horsemen, not horses."</TE>
<TE>   For War Emblem's iffy ankles, Baffert regularly injects the colt
with Legend, a relatively new anti-inflammatory medication.</TE>
<TE>   "It's expensive," Baffert said, "but I give it to a lot of my good
horses. It creates fluid, and helps lubricate the joints."</TE>
<TE>   Another win Saturday and War Emblem will become a legend and a
living advertisement for Legend, all in one swoop.</TE>

<LD>The popularity of steroids among athletes is not difficult to
understand, writes Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post.</LD>
<LD>   "The world we live in seduces us every day with: 'You don't like
something about yourself? Here, take this pill. Make it better,'"
Kornheiser writes. "We crave easy, immediate self-improvement, and we
consider it a right and privilege of lifestyle.</LD>
<LD>   "That goes for allergy medicines, electro-shock ab machines,
plastic surgery and so on.</LD>
<TE>   "You don't like your face? Got too many wrinkles? Your skin
sagging? Change it. Joan Rivers, of course, is the extreme example of
plastic surgery. Her face is so taut now you could play 'Wipeout' on
it. Have you seen Wayne Newton lately? If his face was lifted any
higher, he'd need a ladder to comb his hair."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who are the only six players in NHL history with 500
goals and 1,000 assists?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Let's hope not: Rickey Henderson of the Boston Red Sox, taking
exception to Ken Caminiti's estimate that 50% of major leaguers use
steroids, told the Boston Globe: "Well, I'm not one of them, so
that's 49% right there."</TE>
<TE>   Responded Mike McMulty of San Francisco, to the San Francisco
Chronicle: "I'm guessing that Rickey won't become a math teacher when
he retires."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On the money: Observes Hubert Mizell of the St. Petersburg Times:
"If a bobblehead doll of Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone were
produced, it could be the most accurate portrayal yet, cloning a chap
whose noggin rocks incessantly on the Atlanta bench."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dutch treat: Guus Hiddink, the once-derided Dutch coach of the
South Korea soccer team, experienced an unexpected surge in
popularity after the team improved its play recently, the Washington
Post reported.</TE>
<TE>   Criticized for public displays of affection toward his girlfriend,
Hiddink, 55, was voted "Most Suitable Husband" on the Korean soccer
delegation in a poll of Miss Korea contestants. Proclaimed the local
Daily Sports: "He Is Good Husband Material!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Good Husband Material? "Have you noticed the scarred, ravaged,
hideous faces of hockey players this time of year?" writes Dan
LeBatard of the Miami Herald. "Why do women like Anna Kournikova fall
for hockey players when they all look like something between the
Elephant Man and that kid who played opposite Cher in 'Mask'?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oh, say, can you see? Jon Saraceno of USA Today, on the Dodgers:
"The organization always stood for community and class but, to borrow
a phrase a colleague used to describe the decline of the Boston
Celtics dynasty, the only thing the Dodgers stand for now is the
national anthem."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What are they hiding? "When the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Assn.
(BCBSA) called on Major League Baseball's 60 top sluggers to take a
drug-free pledge in 2000," the BCBSA revealed in a statement released
last week, "two signed the pledge."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Wayne Gretzky, Gordie Howe, Mark Messier, Marcel
Dionne, Steve Yzerman and Ron Francis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle wonders:
"Isn't it time someone exposed the deception in the resumes of Julius
Erving and Dwight Gooden? And what about Dr. Demento?"</TE>

<LD>Giving its isolated populace a rare glimpse of rival South Korea,
North Korea on Saturday broadcast the World Cup match played by
Senegal and France in Seoul.</LD>
<LD>   The delayed showing of the Friday match, which Senegal won, 1-0,
was one of the first known broadcasts of scenes from the South in
North Korea, possibly the world's most closed society.</LD>
<LD>   The North's reclusive communist regime has had no diplomatic ties
with the South since the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended without a
peace treaty. North Koreans can't watch South Korean television,
though the North's broadcasts can be seen in the South.</LD>

<LD>World Cup time usually bristles with all the energy of an off-season
carnival. Entire streets are covered with garish murals and streets
swathed in colorful ribbons.</LD>
<LD>   But this year, the samba drums are mostly silent and many
Brazilians are singing the blues.</LD>
<LD>   "It just doesn't feel the same this year. I just hope we're not a
total disaster," said 17-year-old student Wesley da Silva.</LD>
<TE>   Ronaldo Helal, a sociology professor, says Brazilians suffer from
heightened expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "There's this feeling we don't just have to win, we have to win
Brazilian-style, playing art soccer," Helal said.</TE>

<LD>Nigeria's notoriously unreliable electricity company appealed to the
public not to embark on "an orgy of destruction" if power failures
interrupt televised World Cup games.</LD>
<LD>   The National Electric and Power Authority, whose acronym NEPA is
referred to by Nigerians as "Never Enough Power Anywhere," placed
full-page advertisements in newspapers pleading: "Please don't take
the law into your own hands. We plan to deliver."</LD>

<LD>Things went better at home than they did on the road for trainer
Wally Dollase.</LD>
<LD>   A few hours after Dollase saddled Sumati to a sixth-place finish
in the $100,000 Louisville Handicap at Churchill Downs, Doc Holiday
saved the day with a gritty wire-to-wire win in the $106,500 Will
Rogers Stakes at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   Ridden by David Flores and owned by a partnership that includes
the Jess Miller Trust, Doc Holiday, the 3-1 third choice, withstood
2-1 Johar in the length of the stretch to win by a neck. He completed
the mile on turf in 1:343/5.</LD>
<TE>   A son of Dr Devious, Doc Holiday won for the first time in four
starts in this country. He had won two of seven in England and
France.</TE>
<TE>   Golden Arrow, a maiden and the longest shot in the field at 8-1,
was third, four lengths behind Johar, then came 8-5 favorite True
Phenomenon and Line Rider. Six Hitter was scratched earlier in the
day.</TE>
<TE>   "I waited as long as I could and when [Johar] showed up alongside
in the stretch, I just asked him and he responded," Flores said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Able to find running room in the final eighth of a mile, Macho
Uno, the 2-1 favorite, took off late to win the $500,000
Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Frank Stronach and trained by Joe Orseno, the 4-year-old
Holy Bull colt whose biggest previous win came in the 2000 Breeders'
Cup Juvenile, completed 11/8 miles in 1:502/5 under Gary Stevens.</TE>
<TE>   Evening Attire, the 5-1 fourth choice, was second, a neck in front
of defending champion and 3-2 favorite Include. Shaun Bridgmohan,
Evening Attire's rider, claimed a foul against the winner, but it was
disallowed by the stewards.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trainers Ben Cecil and Howard Zucker were fined for medication
violations last year at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Cecil was fined $5,000 after Queenie Belle, who had finished
second in the Piedra Foundation Handicap Aug. 24, tested positive for
an excessive level of promazine, a sedative. There was also a
redistribution of the purse.</TE>
<TE>   Zucker was fined $6,000 after Crafty C.T., who was unplaced in an
allowance race Aug. 23, tested positive for an excessive level of
albuterol, a breathing aid.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the best sprinters in the country for a number of years, Kona
Gold hasn't done much work at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, he has run only once before in Inglewood, finishing
second in his career debut on May 31, 1998.</LD>
<LD>   The seven-length winner of the race was Regal Thunder, who went on
to become a stakes winner for trainer Julio Canani.</LD>
<TE>   More than four years later, Kona Gold returns to Hollywood Park
and he will be the favorite as he makes his first start of 2002 in
the $100,000 Los Angeles Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   A Grade III at six furlongs, the Los Angeles is the fifth leg of a
pick six that has a carryover of $166,639.73.</TE>
<TE>   Trained by Bruce Headley for a partnership that includes himself
and Andrew and Irwin Molasky, Kona Gold, the 125-pound highweight,
has trained well at Santa Anita for his first race since he was
fourth as the 2-1 favorite in the Frank J. DeFrancis Memorial on Nov.
17 at Laurel.</TE>
<TE>   A winner of 12 of 23 in his career and with more than $2 million
in earnings, Kona Gold has often run well fresh, and he has won seven
of 15 at the Los Angeles distance.</TE>
<TE>   The second choice could be No Armistice, a lightly raced son of
Unbridled who has had success at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Bradley Hughes and trained by Ron Ellis, No Armistice has
won two of three locally and was second in his lone loss.</TE>
<TE>   In his first start in almost a year, the 5-year-old won an
allowance race by seven lengths at Keeneland on April 17.</TE>
<TE>   Kent Desormeaux will ride.</TE>
<TE>   Radiata, Hombre Rapido, Rapidough and Komax round out the field
for the Los Angeles, which was won a year ago by Caller One.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Global Finance will try for her second stakes win
of the meet for co-owner and trainer Jerry Dutton in the $75,000
Cinderella Stakes, the fifth on the Hollywood Park card.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Bluesthestandard and Fit For A King.</TE>
<TE>   The veteran geldings, ages 5 and 9, respectively, won again on
Friday night and are a combined 23 for 40.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Howard Belvoir. The trainer lost with his first 36
starters at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Fin Entertainment, Dixie
Thrill and Moving's Gold in the fourth, Little Bit A Swiss, Global
Finance and Ela Ela in the fifth and singling Fair Bianca in the
sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/81. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $17.80/$459.60. Total money bet: $500.</TE>

<LD>Anyone who saw the fourth race on May 17 at Los Alamitos knows who
the winner should have been.</LD>
<LD>   Wynhurst, the 7-10 favorite, had an absolutely brutal trip in the
$5,000 claimer and it was remarkable he was able to finish as close
as he did.</LD>
<LD>   A 6-year-old gelded son of Mt. Livermore, Wynhurst had to settle
for third, beaten only a head in a three-way blanket finish with
longshot winner Mister Really and Factorability.</LD>
<TE>   If Wynhurst had been able to avoid even some of the trouble he
encountered, he would be entering tonight's fourth race on a
five-race win streak.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight he steps up to the $8,000 level and tries a shorter trip,
870 yards against a field mostly of quarter horses. The field that
includes Kammies Shadow, Cielo Canosa, Gabriels Thunder, Rally Man,
Nashua's Asset and Sir Elton.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. La Yahualiea. 2. Gw Fancy Noble Chick. 3. Stel
Corona. 4. Wynhurst. 5. BDR Bug On The Dash. 6. Five Wishes. 7.
Toasting My Dad. 8. Miami Cartel. 9. Applicator.</TE>
<TE>   Four! In the first, use La Yahualiea, and IB Snow, GW Fancy Noble
Chick and Brisco County Bell in the second, single Stel Corona in the
third and use Wynhurst, Nashua's Asset, Gabriels Thunder, Kammies
Shadow and Sir Elton in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Let It Snow Cash steps into allowance company
in the seventh for trainer Donna McArthur after beating $16,000
maidens May 12.</TE>

<KH>Mark Heisler ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>Is It Too Late to Take Away East's Berth in Finals?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Meanwhile, back in the junior circuit....</LD>
<LD>   It has been a terrific postseason, with some of the most exciting
series in years. Both conference finals have been epics with TV
ratings up more than 10%.</LD>
<LD>   What could go wrong now?</LD>
<TE>   Oh yeah, the usual.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for the "renewal" David Stern keeps pushing, his
league doesn't have parity but parities. Two of them. One in the
powerful West, another in the deflated East.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone watching the Nets and Celtics, outside of New Jersey and
Boston, had to be thinking: One of these teams is actually going to
the NBA Finals?</TE>
<TE>   Since Michael Jordan left the Chicago Bulls, the East has fallen,
4-1, 4-2 and 4-1. Last spring, Philadelphia at least looked
respectable, having led the league most of the season with explosive
Allen Iverson, 7-foot Dikembe Mutombo and a hard-nosed defense, but
the Lakers took them out in five.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets don't look that imposing. If they had played in the West,
they would have had a hard time just getting into the playoffs as the
seventh- or eighth-seeded team.</TE>
<TE>   Against common opponents in the East, the Nets had a .648 winning
percentage, compared to .643 for Seattle and Utah, well below
Portland's .750.</TE>
<TE>   And who took all their big guys?</TE>
<TE>   The West has the greatest concentration of big men the league has
seen since the 1960s, when the East had most of them and Bill Russell
ran over the Lakers' Ray Felix, Jim Krebs, Leroy Ellis and Darrall
Imhoff annually in the finals.</TE>
<TE>   At center the Celtics had willowy Tony Battie, of whom Celtic
great Bob Cousy noted, "He's a power forward and power may not be the
word. His game is basically finesse." The Nets start Todd MacCulloch,
the Krebs of his day.</TE>
<TE>   And is there anything else good on TV?</TE>
<TE>   To get a good rating, the NBA needs a series that goes at least
six games, and not the way it did in 2000, when Indiana won Game 5
after the Lakers had taken a 3-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the East welcomes the challenge, it says.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq [O'Neal] distorts the difference," Indiana President Donnie
Walsh says. "If you take Shaq out of it, then I don't think
Sacramento is just going to knock over anybody in the East."</TE>
<TE>   My solution is to reseed the final four.</TE>
<TE>   This season, that might have matched the Kings and Lakers in the
finals, rather than the annual Western-finals-everyone-calls-the-
real-finals.</TE>
<TE>   Today's game may get a better TV number than anything in the real
NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   Stern keeps explaining patiently this is cyclical. Of course, he
has been saying this for three years and the end of the cycle is
nowhere in sight.</TE>
<TE>   The most promising East teams, in terms of talent, size, youth and
cap space, are actually No. 8 Indiana and No. 15 Chicago, which is
about to draft Duke's Jay Williams and rejoin the living.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Nets could lose Jason Kidd, a 2003 free agent, who
recently repeated he wouldn't sign an extension now.</TE>
<TE>   "This year completely--finals, winning the championship--has
nothing to do with me re-signing here or not," he said. "I have the
luxury to wait and play it out. You never know what happens next
year."</TE>
<TE>   The 76ers are old and creaky, and then there are Iverson and Larry
Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Riley is back to square one with the Miami Heat.</TE>
<TE>   The Orlando Magic has to get Grant Hill back and find a big man.</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit Pistons must prove they're for real and lure a premium
free agent to the Motor City.</TE>
<TE>   Baron Davis, another '03 free agent, may leave the Hornet hive,
wherever it's situated.</TE>
<TE>   The Toronto Raptors are built around Vince Carter, still wowing
them in Nike commercials, if not the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, some East teams are doing short-term rebuilding on such
dubious assumptions as "This is the East, where you don't need to be
so big," and "Let's just try to get to the finals, where anything can
happen."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile in the West, everyone gears up annually, trying to get
bigger to deal with O'Neal and importing athletes to guard Kobe
Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Take the Celtics ... please.</TE>
<TE>   Young and promising, they have a problem: This is their team. They
have no size, no cap space and no No. 1 pick in this draft, having
traded it to Phoenix with still-promising Joe Johnson for journeymen
Rodney Rogers and Tony Delk.</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics' rationale? After years of desperation, they wanted to
take their shot, while it was here.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers is huge, around the middle anyway, but he's still only 6
feet 6 inches high and about half as productive as he was as sixth
man of the year for the Suns in 2000. He averaged 8.9 points against
the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and he and Delk will be free agents so they'll have to give
them $50 million or so.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the East finals weren't interesting, in a minor league
way.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Pierce made three of 20 from the field in Game 3, after the
Boston Globe's Bob Ryan wrote that when he talked, "I could have
sworn I was listening to No. 33."</TE>
<TE>   Ryan presumably meant Steve Kuberski, not Larry Bird, since he
coauthored Bird's first book and understands there are many good
players but only a few who are transcendent.</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics hit on a new strategy: Let's let the Nets get 20
points up and see if we can make them choke. This worked in Game 3,
but fell short in Games 4 and 5.</TE>
<TE>   In Game 3 in the FleetCenter, two lowlifes painted "wife" and
"beater" on their bodies and taunted Jason Kidd's wife Joumana,
watching with their son, T.J. The Kidds were moved to a quieter row
for Game 4 and stayed home for Game 6.</TE>
<TE>   Celtic Coach Jim O'Brien, impressed at the way the Nets handled
his great team, said he thinks they'll win in the finals. "They have
as good a point guard as I've ever seen," he said. "They have
tremendous starters and a deep bench. They are very tough to prepare
for. I think the West is in for a surprise."</TE>
<TE>   Good, we could use a surprise.</TE>
<TE>   The Celtic rallies were fun but the series reminds me of when I
was in Thomas Jefferson Junior High in Springfield, Ill., and the
local paper ran a picture of our point guard, Dick Hinkle, fighting
for the ball during a city tournament game, under the caption: "Big
Doings for Small Fry."</TE>
<TE>   Now, it's time to meet the Big Fry.</TE>
<TE>   It's true, anything can happen in the finals, although it hasn't
lately.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks David, We Needed That</TE>
<TE>   I don't like writing about referees or conspiracies, since I
respect the former and regard the latter as fit conversation for
asylums and talk radio. But when the marquee team, playing at home,
shoots 27 free throws in the fourth quarter of Game 6, extending the
series to a Game 7 on a day when NBC has no other NBA programming, it
doesn't look good.</TE>
<TE>   The referees' task, once thankless, is even harder now, with both
sides flopping and coaches trying to steal an edge for the next game.</TE>
<TE>   The league should crack down further on such discussion because
these days, that's all there is.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the veteran crew of Dick Bavetta, Bob Delaney and Ted
Bernhardt called a great game. There could have been more no-calls.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA way, as opposed to the NCAA, is to let the players decide
games, not the officials, so let 'em play, which is what today's crew
will probably do.</TE>
<TE>   Inconsistency is inevitable when all the calls are subjective, as
they are in basketball. If the games themselves aren't consistent,
why would anyone else expect the officials to be?</TE>
<TE>   In Game 5, the Laker defense let a lot of drivers get O'Neal in
foul trouble. In Game 6, they didn't allow the penetration and Shaq
kept himself out of trouble at the other end, turning and shooting
rather than backing his man in.</TE>
<TE>   A conspiracy, however, would be something else. Not that the refs
couldn't affect the outcome or some NBA exec under pressure couldn't
get demented enough to tell them to.</TE>
<TE>   The problem would be keeping it secret afterward.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the Mafia, but a highly visible and media-penetrated
sub-culture. If a league exec ever made an improper hint to a
referee, it would leak. One day, in a bar, or a labor dispute, or a
lawsuit, someone would talk and there would be a scandal they'd
remember the rest of the century.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how you know it isn't happening. The Lakers are two-point
underdogs today.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the books offshore and in Las Vegas are still
taking action. If this thing didn't look kosher, it would he whisked
off the board. If you think you're suspicious, you're an innocent,
compared to a gambler.</TE>
<TE>   "If anything fishy was going on, like the college basketball
scandals, the lines in Las Vegas would move dramatically," Gary
Oldshan of the Gold Sheet says. "There's been nothing like that."</TE>
<TE>   Many coaches and players go beyond suspicion into paranoia, but
they're the ones who can acknowledge only two outcomes: "We won," or
"We were cheated."</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the stand-up guys like Charlotte Coach Paul Silas.</TE>
<TE>   During his second-round loss to the Nets, Deputy Commissioner Russ
Granik acknowledged the league wouldn't be comfortable with the
Hornets in the finals, and everyone in Carolina ran around reviewing
every call against them.</TE>
<TE>   Silas, nobly refusing to play along, said complaining about the
referees "is for losers."</TE>
<TE>   However, if you losers, er skeptics, are convinced this isn't on
the level, you should just watch something else. It's still a free
country.</TE>
<TE>   Unless, of course, you think everything's fixed.</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   Just asking: Why wouldn't the Clippers offer Houston Lamar Odom,
either or both of their lottery picks, and anyone else it takes
except Michael Olowokandi and Elton Brand, for the No. 1 pick and
Williams? Williams would become their point guard, giving them a
cheap starter for five seasons. The deal would slice $5 million off
their cap, make it easier to sign Olowokandi and Brand and clean up
their logjam at small forward, giving Darius Miles a chance to
play....</TE>
<TE>   On the bright side, he gets to leave: The Cleveland Cavaliers
rejected Andre Miller's request for a maximum extension, suggesting
they think they can help themselves more by trading him for help at
several positions. "I would like to get it out of the way and go
ahead and play the season," he told the Akron Beacon Journal, "but
that might not happen." ... The Touchables: A Denver Nugget official
said they have "no untouchable players," meaning Antonio McDyess is
officially for sale.... How much is that Big Dog in the Window?
Milwaukee's Glenn Robinson is back on the market, too, or as Buck GM
Ernie Grunfeld put it: "Kareem [Abdul-Jabbar] got traded and Oscar
Robertson got traded, so for the right deal, the right situation, if
it will make you a better team, I don't think there's an untouchable
player in this league. But it would have to be the right deal." ...
He's a walking anachronism, partly fact and partly fiction: Celtic
assistant Dick Harter on Red Auerbach's visits to practice: "He
lights up that cigar [and] it drives the guys crazy."</TE>

<LD>Let the second-guessing begin.</LD>
<LD>   Lakewood High pitched to Camarillo slugger Delmon Young in the
third inning of the Southern Section Division I championship Saturday
night at Edison Field instead of intentionally walking him to load
the bases and suffered devastating consequences.</LD>
<LD>   Young drilled a double to left-center field to score top-seeded
Camarillo's first two runs in an 8-1 victory over second-seeded
Lakewood that gave the Scorpions (29-4) their first title. Camarillo
lost to Fountain Valley in 1985 in its only other championship game.</LD>
<TE>   Travis Sutton (14-0) pitched almost flawlessly after surrendering
a run and three first-inning singles. The senior right-hander, who
struck out four, issued two walks after the first to shut down
Lakewood (28-6).</TE>
<TE>   Young, a junior center fielder, went one for two with three walks.
He's 11 for 12 against Lakewood in two seasons. "I was expecting them
to pitch to me," Young said. "They had their ace and they were coming
right after me."</TE>
<TE>   Young wouldn't have batted in the third inning if Lakewood catcher
Arnold Iribarren had caught Garrett Barlow's foul pop-up with two
outs.</TE>
<TE>   "We considered [walking Young]," Lakewood Coach Spud O'Neil said,
"but we had a plan to throw a pitch high and in. It was right over
the plate."</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo scored two more runs in the inning on Brad Boyer's
double to right.</TE>
<TE>   Villa Park 3, Canyon Country Canyon 2--Villa Park, which is known
for taking advantage of second chances, needed a third opportunity
Saturday to win the Division II title with two seventh-inning runs.</TE>
<TE>   Villa Park, which failed to capitalize on scoring chances in the
fourth and sixth innings, scored the winning run when Mike Thompson,
who had three of the Spartans' 10 hits, came home from third base on
Dane Ferguson's flare into shallow right field.</TE>
<TE>   The title was the second in three seasons for the unseeded
Spartans (24-7), who won the Division III championship in 2000 after
being defeated by Tustin in the quarterfinals. The Tillers had to
forfeit the victory for using an ineligible player.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the Spartans couldn't score despite loading the bases
with none out in the fourth and putting runners on first and third
with one out in the sixth. Canyon starter Jake Coash (9-4) took a 2-1
lead into the seventh inning but had to leave after surrendering
consecutive singles and recording one out because he had reached his
10-inning limit for the week.</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Sergio Almanzar gave up a run-scoring single to Kirk
McConchie that tied the score and intentionally walked A.J. Smith to
load the bases. Ferguson, who drove in a run in the second on a bloop
single, then picked up his winning hit.</TE>
<TE>   Canyon (24-6) scored its runs in the fourth when Clay Britton came
home on a wild pitch and Ryan Pipho drove in Cody Leavitt on a
single.</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Steve Johns (5-0) pitched two perfect innings to get the
victory for Villa Park.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside Arlington 1, Santa Margarita 0--Joe Reyes pitched a
three-hit shutout and scored in the top of the seventh inning for the
unseeded Lions (25-6) in the Division III championship.</TE>
<TE>   Reyes led off the seventh with a double, moved to third on a wild
pitch and scored on Larry Mendoza's sacrifice fly to give Arlington
its second section title. The other came in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Unseeded Santa Margarita (17-11) mounted a threat in the bottom of
the inning when Andrew Nieves drew a one-out walk and pinch-runner
Doug Reinhardt went to second on Chris Iseley's single to left.</TE>
<TE>   But Reyes (10-2) retired the final two batters to record his third
victory and second shutout of the postseason for Arlington. Reyes, a
junior left-hander, gave up four walks but struck out nine and
allowed only one runner to reach third base.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita right-hander Brendan Judge (4-3) threw a
three-hitter with seven strikeouts and a walk.</TE>

<LD>Adam Simon pitched a four-hitter and scored the winning run in the
bottom of the eighth inning on an error to help top-seeded La Puente
Bishop Amat win its second consecutive Southern Section Division IV
title with a 2-1 victory over second-seeded Westminster La Quinta at
Edison Field on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The UCLA-bound Simon scored on a routine grounder by pinch-hitter
Andrew Soto. Third baseman Ian Stewart of La Quinta (29-3) fielded
the ball cleanly, but Brian Wason missed the catchable throw to
first, allowing Simon to score from third with two outs.</LD>
<LD>   "It's what everyone dreams of," said Simon, who helped Bishop Amat
finish 28-2. "I had this in my mind since I was a little kid."</LD>
<TE>   Simon (13-0) struck out five and walked one but hit three batters.
He allowed an unearned run in the second when Ed Arreola walked, took
second on a ground out and scored on Brandon Laird's single off right
fielder Matthew Lawhorn's glove.</TE>
<TE>   La Quinta starter Ian Kennedy was equally effective, striking out
eight over six innings. He escaped two jams but contributed to Bishop
Amat's first run when his pickoff throw to first base in the third
inning was wide and allowed Mark Esparza to take third base. Esparza
then scored on David Pierson's ground out. Mike McKernan relieved
Kennedy in the seventh.</TE>

<HD>Bruno Sweeps 100 and 200</HD>

<AU>Dan Arritt</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Matt Bruno desperately wanted to prove he was the fastest high school
runner in the state this season, so he did it twice Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Bruno, a senior at Mission Viejo Trabuco Hills High, won the 100
and 200 meters in front of 10,751 at the state championships at
Cerritos College, becoming the first white athlete to capture both
events since Forrest Beaty of Glendale Hoover in 1961. The last white
runner to win either the 100 or 200 was Chuck Bommarito of San Bruno
Crestmoor when he won the 200 in 1971.</LD>
<LD>   Bruno won the 100 in 10.55 seconds, despite a headwind of 1.5
meters per second, then came back less than an hour later to win the
200 in 20.82, the fourth-fastest time in the nation this season.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm especially happy I won both races," said Bruno, who has
signed with UCLA. "I haven't had as much confidence in the 200 as
I've had in the 100."</TE>
<TE>   Bruno single-handedly earned 20 points and helped Trabuco Hills
finish third in the team standings. Bakersfield won the team title
with 32 points and Long Beach Poly was second with 30. Bakersfield
began the final event, the 1,600 relay, needing a top six finish to
clinch the team title. The Drillers finished fifth, while Poly won
the relay in 3:12.90.</TE>
<TE>   Poly had a clean run in the opening 400 relay, winning in 40.63,
the second-fastest time in the nation this season, but Bakersfield
took the lead for good with back-to-back victories by Thomas Mack in
the 110 hurdles (14.34) and Blake Mackey in the 400 (47.93). Mack
also won the 300 hurdles in 37.45.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Woodbridge sophomore Michael Haddan upset Duane Solomon of
Lompoc Cabrillo in the 800. Haddan won in 1:51.41, the only
underclassman to win a boys' state title.</TE>
<TE>   Other winners from the region were:</TE>
<TE>   * Ronald Hill of Walnut in the long jump (23-91/2).</TE>
<TE>   * Nathan Atkins of Cerritos in the triple jump (49-73/4).</TE>
<TE>   * Noah Bryant of Carpinteria in the shotput (65-73/4).</TE>
<TE>   * Jarered Morgan of La Quinta in the discus (194-1).</TE>
<TE>   Among the notable winners: David Moore of Orinda Miramonte upset
defending state champion Mike Landers of Merced Golden Valley in the
pole vault, clearing 16-6; Matt Johnsrud of Roseville Woodcreek
passed Oxnard Rio Mesa's Phillip Reid with about 30 meters remaining
in the 1,600 and won in 4:11.89. Reid, the Southern Section Division
I and Masters Meet champion, was second in 4:12.38.</TE>

<KH>GIRLS' STATE TRACK MEET</KH>
<HD>Brown Helps North Win</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Riverside J.W. North High clinched the girls' team title in the state
track and field championships at Cerritos College on Saturday when
the Huskies' fourth-place finish in the 1,600-meter relay gave them a
57-53 victory over favorite and defending champion Long Beach Poly.</LD>
<LD>   But for all intents and purposes, North won the meet before 10,751
about 70 minutes earlier when junior Ashlee Brown posted an upset
victory in the 300 low hurdles while running in the tight confines of
lane two. Brown won the 300 hurdles in a then-career best of 41.81
seconds in last year's state meet, but she had failed to run under 43
seconds this season after an early-season hamstring injury.</LD>
<LD>   She was the seventh of nine qualifiers from Friday's
preliminaries, but pulled away from Julia Pitts of North Torrance and
Tunisia Johnson of Long Beach Poly in the final 50 meters to clock
41.67, the fastest time in the state this year and second-fastest in
the nation.</LD>
<TE>   "I was hoping for first place," said Brown, who ran the first leg
on North's 1,600 relay team that clocked 3:48.65. "I just wanted to
run my race. That was something I hadn't done very well this season."</TE>
<TE>   Brown's victory was worth 10 points to the Huskies and gave them a
45-27 lead over Long Beach Poly.</TE>
<TE>   The Jackrabbits cut their deficit to 45-43 when sophomore Shalonda
Solomon led them to a 2-3-5 finish in the 200, but North extended its
lead to 53-43 when senior Chaunte Howard finished second in the
triple jump with a 40-feet 41/4-inch effort.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Poly won the 1,600 relay in 3:35.99, the second-fastest
time ever by a U.S. high school team. But when North crossed the
finish line in fourth, the Huskies won their third state title in
four years.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most satisfying one because of everything we went
through this year," said Coach Charles Leathers. "The season-ending
injury of sprinter Tracee Thomas. The [injury] problems with Ashlee.
This hasn't been an easy season."</TE>
<TE>   The long jump and 100 high hurdles were also key events for North.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Lena Bettis and Howard finished first and second in the
long jump at 19-81/4 and 19-5, and sophomore teammate Dominique
Manning placed third in the 100 hurdles in 14.15. Just as important,
Poly's Deshante Harris and Johnson finished a non-scoring eighth and
ninth after qualifying third and fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Allyson Felix of North Hills L.A. Baptist was the lone
double winner in the girls' meet, winning her second consecutive 100
title with a time of 11.55 and posting her first victory in the 200
with a nation-leading 22.83. The 200 time moved her to third on the
all-time national list behind Marion Jones (22.58 for Thousand Oaks
in 1992) and Chandra Cheeseborough (22.77 for Jacksonville, Fla.,
Ribault in 1975).</TE>

<HD>Etiwanda Collects Its First Title, 2-0</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Etiwanda lost five of its first seven games this season, but the
Eagles won five in a row in the playoffs and claimed the Southern
Section Division I softball championship on Saturday at Barber
Memorial Park in Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   In winning their first title in the program's 18 years, the Eagles
defeated second-seeded Dana Hills, 2-0, knocking off a team that had
not won a league title since 1981 and had not gone past the second
round of the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   "It means a lot for us personally, and for our school," said
pitcher Jackie Rogers, who improved to 15-2. "To hang that banner in
the gym is unbelievable--there are only three hanging in there."</LD>
<TE>   Etiwanda (24-7) may be light in the banner department, but
Saturday they were heavy on composure.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles didn't commit an error--they made only three in five
playoff victories and defeated top-seeded Valencia in the
quarterfinals--and always made the right play.</TE>
<TE>   Dana Hills (25-8-1) made two errors in the decisive fifth inning,
when Amber Spaulding's two-out single--her third hit of the
game--drove home Sarah Kuramata with the first run. Rogers scored on
an errant throw by center fielder Jessica Van Houten. Kuramata had
reached on a fielder's choice and Rogers had walked.</TE>
<TE>   Dana Hills Coach Margo Watkins said that when Spaulding stepped to
the plate, "I thought about walking her momentarily, and maybe if the
cleanup hitter wasn't coming up behind her, that might have been an
option."</TE>
<TE>   Orange Lutheran 2, Oak Park 0--Third-seeded Orange Lutheran didn't
waste any time in winning its second consecutive section title,
needing 66 minutes to add a Division IV championship to the Division
V title it won last year. Sophomore Maggie Davidson (18-4) pitched a
three-hitter for Orange Lutheran (27-6). She didn't walk a batter and
struck out four.</TE>
<TE>   She was backed by the clutch hitting of junior Shelly Meardy in
the bottom of the fourth inning. After Jamie Adams drew a two-out
walk and junior Lindsay Larson singled to right field, Meardy's
chopper over third base scored Adams.</TE>
<TE>   Orange Lutheran added an insurance run in the sixth inning as
pinch-runner Karla Baer scored when pitcher Melissa Johnson dropped a
pop-up by Larson. Kimmy Miklos--one of two senior starters--reached
base on a fielder's choice.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson (18-6) gave up four hits and struck out six for Oak Park,
which began the season 10-10 but defeated top-seeded El Segundo in
the second round en route to its first title game in 21 years.</TE>
<TE>   Canoga Park Faith Baptist 2, Westlake Village Oaks Christian
0--Ivette Hernandez doubled in two runs in the bottom of the sixth
inning off Ashlee Freeman, who hadn't pitched more than four innings
in a game in two months because of arm problems, to give the
second-seeded Contenders the Division VI title in their first trip to
a final.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman (12-2) allowed two hits through five innings but gave up
four in the sixth. Jessica Velasquez and Amy Rudolph started the
rally for Faith Baptist (24-5) with back-to-back singles.</TE>
<TE>   Those runs were more than enough for the Utah-bound Hernandez
(18-2), who gave up five hits, walked two and struck out seven,
including Sara Radabaugh to end the game with runners at second and
third. The top-seeded Lions finished 29-5.</TE>

<HD>El Dorado Beats Kennedy for Division II Title</HD>
<DH>Prep softball: Watkins outpitches Turner and Golden Hawks
score go-ahead run in sixth, then survive scare in seventh to win,
2-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Placentia El Dorado on Saturday became one of the Southern Section's
most unlikely softball champions.</LD>
<LD>   Twice beaten in the Empire League by rival La Palma Kennedy,
facing a pitcher who had shut them out twice and had allowed only one
run in her previous 129 innings, the Golden Hawks found a way to
defeat Kennedy, 2-1, for the Division II title at Barber Memorial
Park in Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   It is El Dorado's first championship since 1977, which was also
its last appearance in a section final.</LD>
<TE>   The victory was hard-earned for El Dorado (21-9). The Golden Hawks
got out of a bases-loaded jam in the top of the sixth inning with a
1-2-3 double play, scored the winning run in the bottom of the sixth
on a two-out double by Heather Martin, and clinched the title when
third baseman Kristi Durant speared a drive that would have scored
the tying run.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy (24-6-1), ranked fifth in the state, had UCLA-bound
Michelle Turner pitching, but sophomore Amanda Watkins (12-4) got the
best of the pitching duel, including retiring Turner (23-5) for the
last out with a runner on second base in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Turner's smash down the third-base line was caught off the dirt by
Durant, who threw the ball to first base. Umpires didn't rule whether
Durant caught it or not--she said she did--but it was moot when
Martin grabbed Durant's off-line throw and stepped on the bag ahead
of Turner.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy beat El Dorado in league, 4-0 and 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a different team than when we played them before, and we're
becoming somewhat of a powerhouse," said Watkins, who gave up six
hits, hit a batter and struck out one. "The mystique surrounding
Michelle sometimes freezes teams."</TE>
<TE>   Turner gave up seven hits and struck out five.</TE>

<LD>I was trying to talk the other night to Ed Rush, the NBA's referee
boss, and hadn't even gotten around to mentioning anything about
fixing games, when I noticed Stu Jackson, the league's senior vice
president of basketball operations, eavesdropping.</LD>
<LD>   I'm told Rush speaks English, but I sure couldn't make any sense
of what he was saying, and all I had said to him was "hello."</LD>
<LD>   At one point I heard Rush mutter something like, "No one is
perfect," and I guess Jackson heard the same thing, because that's
when he put a stop to our chat.</LD>
<TE>   I would have liked the chance to strongly disagree with Rush,
because I think if you put the two best Lakers together with the
three best referees, that's a perfect team, probably the best the NBA
has ever seen.</TE>
<TE>   I know the five of them did a great job together Friday night to
beat the Sacramento Kings.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, right now I'd be willing to trade Rick Fox, Samaki Walker
and Robert Horry straight up for Dick Bavetta, Bob Delaney and Ted
Bernhardt.</TE>
<TE>   Right now I'd trade Lindsey Hunter and Devean George for an F.P.
Santangelo baseball card.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SPORTS EDITOR Bill Dwyre had called from his seat on press row to
my seat on press row, because he likes to save his legs for trips to
the concession stand, and told me he knew Rush well and Rush would be
a good guy to talk with about the officiating in this series, which
everyone seems to be talking about now.</TE>
<TE>   I don't recall too many of Dwyre's ideas paying off, but I haven't
won the lottery either, so I continue to waste money and buy a ticket
every Wednesday and Saturday. I just wish Dwyre had told me I would
have learned more about referees from Rush Limbaugh than Ed Rush.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, I was standing there with Rush when Jackson panicked and
he just started blubbering: "I need him, I need him ... "</TE>
<TE>   Right away I was thinking to myself, "Do I know the Heimlich
maneuver?" because Jackson looked as though he was choking, and I've
seen Derek Fisher try to shoot three-pointers, so I know what choking
looks like.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, however, grabbed Rush by the elbow, cutting him off in
mid-gibberish, and began steering him away from me, while repeating,
"I need him."</TE>
<TE>   "That's the oldest trick in the book," I yelled as they made their
getaway, and while I had never given much stock to this NBA
conspiracy talk, these guys were sure acting suspiciously.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, I thought when it came to running and hiding, USC
Athletic Director Mike Garrett was quick on his feet, but Jackson's
got some wheels.</TE>
<TE>   All this took place outside the officials' locker room, and the
ruckus prompted a security guard to talk into his lapel. I can't be
sure, but I thought I heard him say, "We've got another reporter here
trying to follow one of Dwyre's crazy ideas."</TE>
<TE>   I took a few steps toward Jackson and yelled, "He looks like a big
boy to me, why not let him talk for himself? You guys got something
to hide?"</TE>
<TE>   What were they going to do, give me a T?</TE>
<TE>   They kept moving, and probably would have made a clean break if
Wayne Cooper, the Kings' vice president of basketball operations,
hadn't stopped them, and while I couldn't hear what was being said, I
hope that handshake between the three of them has no bearing on
today's outcome.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I HAD the best seat in the arena to determine if there was a
problem with the referees Friday night. I could look at Bobby Knight
sitting just off to my side, watch the game and check out Knight's
reaction every time an official blew his whistle. One bad call, and
if he choked his wife, I'd be the first to see it.</TE>
<TE>   The chairs were bolted to the floor, so I felt safe being that
close to Knight.</TE>
<TE>   When everyone came to their feet, I was a little concerned because
Knight remained planted in his chair, and he couldn't possibly see
anything from his vantage point other than the jiggling Laker Girls
dancing three feet in front of him, and I'm sure that had to be
annoying.</TE>
<TE>   At one point Knight's wife got up and stood between Knight and the
runway where the referees would be making their exit, and I thought,
"Now that's a good wife." Of course, she was also standing between
Knight and the jiggling Laker Girls, and so I also thought, "Now
there's a wife."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I DIDN'T hear Knight curse, see him throw anything or make an
obscene gesture, so I'd have to say that's proof the refs did a fine
job the other night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SACRAMENTO COACH Rick Adelman, however, implied the officials
threw the game the other night, while earlier in the series, the
Lakers made the claim the refs were favoring the Kings' cause.</TE>
<TE>   NBC should be videotaping the arrival of the officials instead of
the players with Jim Gray asking whom they favor to win. I'd like to
see how fast Rush and Jackson would be running if Gray approached
them.</TE>
<TE>   More than anything I'd like the feeling everything is on the up
and up at such a wonderful climactic moment, and we're not here just
because this was shaded ever so slightly for the benefit of NBC and a
seventh game.</TE>
<TE>   If I hadn't seen NBA executives running scared, I'd have given
them the benefit of the doubt. Now I just wish they'd stop running
and tell me who they have winning today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Andy Fox:</TE>
<TE>   "Why even play the games anymore? I have a feeling if you looked
behind David Stern you would probably see Vince McMahon standing
there with a smile on his face and a script in his hands."</TE>
<TE>   He has to do something with those leftover XFL scripts.</TE>

<HD>Beating Simon Not Simple</HD>

<LD>In baseball lore at La Puente Bishop Amat High, Adam Simon has become
almost a cartoon superhero. Coaches, teammates and fans think he's
indestructible, unshakeable, even unbeatable. Instead of wearing a
baseball uniform, a cape might better fit his image.</LD>
<LD>   "He's a warrior," Coach Kenny Kendrena said. "He's as good as it
gets. He's in the upper echelon of competitors."</LD>
<LD>   On a cloudless Saturday morning at Edison Field, with the Southern
Section Division IV championship at stake, Simon was thriving in the
tension-filled environment, going against the one pitcher in Southern
California, Ian Kennedy of Westminster La Quinta, capable of
challenging him pitch for pitch.</LD>
<TE>   "They both did their thing," Kendrena said. "It was a classic
championship matchup."</TE>
<TE>   It figured that extra innings would be required to determine a
champion for a game featuring the two best teams in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Amat (28-2) pulled out a 2-1 victory over La Quinta (29-3),
with Simon scoring the winning run on an error in the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought I'd be in a game to say no one deserves to lose,"
La Quinta Coach Dave Demarest said.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy (13-0), who pitched only six innings so he wouldn't exceed
the mandatory 10-inning limit for the week, held the Lancers to one
unearned run on three hits while striking out eight. Simon, though,
went all eight innings, striking out five while giving up four hits.
He finished the season 13-0 with a 1.36 earned-run average and was
27-1 in his three-year varsity career, which included consecutive
Division IV titles.</TE>
<TE>   There was no way Simon intended to leave Edison Field without his
team taking home the championship trophy.</TE>
<TE>   "Our team is too competitive," he said. "We weren't going to give
in."</TE>
<TE>   La Quinta did its best to stay close. Kennedy came up with some
clutch strikeouts with men in scoring position to frustrate the
Lancers. He finished his junior season with 168 strikeouts in 901/3
innings.</TE>
<TE>   "Going against the No. 1 or No. 2 team in the country, of course
you had to throw your best," Kennedy said. "I had to toughen up."</TE>
<TE>   Errors, however, were the difference. Bishop Amat, which had six
players sign with NCAA Division I schools, made none. La Quinta had
three. Kennedy threw away a pickoff attempt to first base, setting up
the Lancers' first run in the third inning. But the most critical
error came on the final play of the game when first baseman Kevin
Wason missed a throw from third baseman Ian Stewart with the bases
loaded.</TE>
<TE>   La Quinta players had tears in their eyes afterward. They were so
close to defeating a team that has rarely lost the last two seasons.
But beating Bishop Amat is difficult. The Lancers won the national
championship last year and deserve it again this season after
finishing with 26 consecutive victories. They dodged no one, playing
tough opponents and winning big games away from home.</TE>
<TE>   Their last three playoff victories were all by one run. And they
had to go against elite pitchers, such as Loyola Marymount-bound
Steve Kahn of Anaheim Servite, USC-bound Bobby Paschal of West Hills
Chaminade and finally Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not easy at all and we'll relish it," Kendrena said. "The
harder the road is, the better. It's the sign of a true champion to
be able to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Kendrena, a 31-year-old former Cal State Northridge pitcher,
certainly deserves credit for molding the Lancers into a
fundamentally sound outfit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a special group," Kendrena said. "One of the things I'm most
proud of is this team is so dedicated and they thrive on being
together."</TE>
<TE>   The amateur draft begins Tuesday. Simon figures to be taken but
college is his likely destination. He has signed with UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Gary Adams compares him to two former Bruin two-way
performers, Alex Sanchez and Dave Zancanaro, who became first-round
draft picks. Simon was already thinking of trying to recruit Kennedy
to the Bruins for 2004.</TE>
<TE>   But Saturday wasn't about the future. It was about putting the
finishing touch on a high school career that will be long remembered
by Bishop Amat fans. Simon was at the bottom of the dog pile near
home plate, his 5-foot-11 frame covered by his best friends. "We've
played together forever," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It will be a lasting memory.</TE>

<LD>This year's Western Conference finals would rank among the top
playoff matchups in NBA history if there hadn't been so much whining
about the officiating.</LD>
<LD>   Every time the Lakers have won, the Sacramento Kings have cried
about what they claim is favorable treatment given to Shaquille
O'Neal and the two-time defending NBA champions.</LD>
<LD>   After each Sacramento victory, the Lakers have complained about
the uneven number of fouls called on them compared to the Kings.</LD>
<TE>   By now, the Lakers and Kings should understand that whichever team
plays more aggressively will have an edge in today's Game 7 at Arco
Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Lakers depend on O'Neal's power in the paint to run
their offense, they haven't always been the aggressors in the series.
The Kings took it to the Lakers early in Game 2, 3 and 4.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming both teams start off ready to play, the team that has
made the best adjustments after facing each other six times over the
last two weeks will have the edge.</TE>
<TE>   A breakdown of Game 7:</TE>
<TE>   KINGS' MOVE--One overlooked aspect of the series has been Doug
Christie's inability to provide consistent offense. Christie has not
created turnovers the way he did during the regular season and he has
a tendency to force things on offense when Kobe Bryant gets his game
going.</TE>
<TE>   If the Lakers slow down Mike Bibby as they did Friday, Sacramento
needs Christie to start producing offensively. Because the Kings
haven't been getting much production from their shooting guard
position with Christie, Bobby Jackson or Peja Stojakovic, Los Angeles
hasn't suffered despite Derek Fisher's lack of scoring.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Rick Adelman has to start thinking about using Lawrence
Funderburke. He got a chance to play late in Game 6 and made an
impact.</TE>
<TE>   LAKERS' MOVE--Coach Phil Jackson's decision to throw fresh bodies
at Bibby and turn up the heat for three quarters before turning to
Bryant worked to perfection Friday. Fisher did not contribute much
offense, but he worked well with Lindsey Hunter in making it
difficult for Bibby to bring the ball up the court. By the time
Bryant got on Bibby, the King point guard was frustrated.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers may still be attempting too many three-point shots, but
at least Rick Fox, Robert Horry and Devean George tried more
short-range shots in Game 6. This type of movement is needed against
the Kings, who gamble a lot on defense. Samaki Walker did not have
much of an impact Friday, playing only four minutes. If his nagging
knee injury has become more of a problem, Jackson might have to give
more playing time to Slava Medvedenko.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers must hit the defensive boards better than they did in
Game 6. With Chris Webber leading the way with four, the Kings had a
14-6 edge in offensive rebounds. Horry and Fox have to help out more
because the Lakers can't afford to keep giving Sacramento added
possessions.</TE>
<TE>   KEY POINT--The most important statistic will be free throws
attempted. Before Game 6, the Kings had gone to the line nearly 40
times more than the Lakers, but Friday things were reversed. With
O'Neal and Bryant staying out of foul trouble, the Lakers' attacking
style was the main reason they made 16 more free throws than
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers won Game 6 on the line, with 27 free throws in the
fourth quarter. But they earned this edge with how they played during
the first three quarters. Whichever team approaches today's game like
this, instead of waiting for the final 12 minutes, will win the
series. If the Lakers play Game 7 the way they've played the previous
two games, the Kings' season will end tonight.</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Rather than bemoan a missed opportunity Friday in Game 6, King power
forward Chris Webber embraced the notion of living out a childhood
fantasy in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals against the Lakers
today at Arco Arena.</LD>
<LD>   What, him worry?</LD>
<LD>   "It's what we've all been dreaming about since we were little kids
on the court acting like Magic [Johnson] and [Larry] Bird," Webber
said on the eve of the deciding game of the best-of-seven series.</LD>
<TE>   The Kings did not have a formal practice Saturday, but watched
some videotape of their 106-102 loss to the Lakers in Game 6, hoping
to find a way to deny Shaquille O'Neal the ball. O'Neal scored 41
points Friday.</TE>
<TE>   They also listened to Coach Rick Adelman and General Manager Geoff
Petrie give pep talks about winning Game 7 and advancing to the NBA
Finals for the first time since 1951, when the franchise was based in
Rochester, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Any lingering anger over their loss Friday slipped away by
Saturday, according to Webber.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, negative is not good," Webber said. "Intense, yes. Tense,
no. It was good to come to practice today and watch film and listen
to coach talk and get it all out of our systems."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had a 40-25 edge in free throws in Game 6, including a
27-9 advantage in the fourth quarter. On further review, Adelman had
only two objections to the officiating Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Adelman disagreed with the foul against point guard Mike Bibby,
who took an elbow from Kobe Bryant that bloodied his nose late in the
game. He also believed O'Neal should have drawn a flagrant foul for
his takedown on Lawrence Funderburke.</TE>
<TE>   "Other than that ... ," Adelman said. "You've got to let it go.
We'll have a different crew for Game 7. We're not playing the
officials. We're playing the Lakers. I would question those two
calls, though."</TE>
<TE>   A more pressing concern for Adelman than the officiating was
finding ways to keep O'Neal from receiving the ball so close to the
basket, forcing the Kings to either foul him or allow him to take
easy shots.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't let him catch it where he wants to catch it," Adelman
said of O'Neal, who made 14 of 25 shots, 13 of 17 free throws and
fouled out Sacramento centers Vlade Divac and Scot Pollard in Game 6.</TE>
<TE>   "He's too good. We have to have people around him. We need
weak-side help. It was one of the main things we talked about,
eliminating his easy catches. But give him credit. He's getting
really aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Sacramento Kings have never played a Game 7, but have played a
winner-take-all Game 5 twice and lost both times. The Kings
squandered a 2-1 series lead and lost the next two games to the Utah
Jazz in the opening round of the 1999 playoffs. They also lost Game 5
to the Lakers in the first round in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The franchise's last Game 7 appearance was in 1981, when the team
was based in Kansas City. Those Kings defeated the Suns in the
conference semifinals at Phoenix. The Houston Rockets then eliminated
the Kings in the conference finals, four games to one.</TE>

<HD>Key to Game Looks Like Entry Passes</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers had their usual shooting issues from the outside in
Friday's Game 6 at Staples Center, so it's no surprise their
offensive mistakes were made in trying to get the basketball to
Shaquille O'Neal, who squashed Vlade Divac and Scot Pollard en route
to 41 points and 17 rebounds.</LD>
<LD>   For all the talk of scoring balance and role-player involvement,
however, if the officials allow O'Neal the same aggressiveness in
Game 7 at Arco Arena, the Laker perimeter players will try the same
high-risk entry passes today.</LD>
<LD>   "His activity level was increased," said Rick Fox, who passed up
open shots to get the ball to O'Neal. "His movement across the lane
and his position at the basket was great. And then his teammates,
when he speaks of wanting the ball and bringing the ball to him,
nothing should change our focus of seeing him in the lane and
whenever he's available getting the ball to him."</LD>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson said he expected the focus today to be on
the time O'Neal spends in the lane, which the Kings and television
announcers charged was often longer than the allowable three seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "We created spacing for Shaquille so he could move through the
lane," Jackson said. "In the past games, they crowded the lane and
they made it difficult to move, because he had two bodies on him all
the time, either holding him off or keeping him at bay. This game we
provided more space for him by different movements in our offense."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ahead by a point in Game 6 and desperate to clear Mike Bibby for
an inbounds pass, Kobe Bryant, who is 6 feet 7, frantically pushed
through and inadvertently caught the 6-1 guard in the nose with his
right forearm.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby played the last 13 seconds with tissue paper wadded into his
right nostril, and Bryant wouldn't even shrug.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Bryant said, Bibby started it by holding him.</TE>
<TE>   "You could have called a foul first, when he grabbed me," Bryant
said. "You could have called that foul. I think it was a good
no-call."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Samaki Walker's bruised left knee has slowed him enough that
Jackson has gone more to Robert Horry (43 minutes in Game 6) and even
to Slava Medvedenko (five minutes in Game 6, after playing two in the
previous five).</TE>
<TE>   "I think Samaki's not moving with freedom," Jackson said. "He
carried that brace out there on his leg and I could see that he was
laboring. Really, you've got to have all your faculties about you in
a game like this."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings got the ball to Chris Webber with Medvedenko in the
game, and Medvedenko was assessed two fouls in his brief playing
time. Walker, who blocked three shots in 13 previous playoff games,
blocked two in four possessions Friday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's not their typical game, but the Lakers have attempted 47 more
three-point shots in the series than the Kings have, and made only
four more.</TE>
<TE>   They were four for 15 from the three-point line in Game 6. Fox,
Horry and Derek Fisher were a combined three for 11.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought [Friday] we shot the ball better," Jackson said, and
grinned.</TE>

<LD>NBC's telecast of the Lakers' 106-102 victory over Sacramento in Game
6 of the Western Conference finals Friday night drew an impressive 33
rating with a 52 share in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   That means the game was watched in one-third of all TV households,
and in more than half of those where TV was being watched at the
time.</LD>
<LD>   In Sacramento, the game did even better, with a 43.0/64.</LD>
<TE>   Nationally, the game recorded a 13.5 overnight rating with a 24
share, an 82% increase over a comparable game last season--Game 6 of
the Eastern Conference finals between Philadelphia and Milwaukee.
That game earned a 7.4/13.</TE>
<TE>   The rating for Friday night's game peaked at 8:30 p.m. with a
16.8/36.</TE>
<TE>   The 13.5 average for the game represents the highest overnight
rating for an NBA playoff game, excluding the NBA Finals, since Game
7 of the 2000 Western Conference finals between the Lakers and
Portland, which drew a 14.5/23.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey's victory over Boston Friday night earned an 8.7
overnight rating with a 16 share nationally, and in L.A. the game
drew an 11.1/24.</TE>
<TE>   Final national ratings will not be available until Monday.</TE>

<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All along, I've wanted to see a seventh game. But not if it had to
come about like this.</LD>
<LD>   If you care about basketball, Friday night's Game 6 of the Western
Conference finals was a rip-off. The Kings and Lakers didn't decide
this series; three referees did. Statistical evidence is usually
circumstantial, but consider this anyway: The Lakers had shot an
average of 22 foul shots through the first five games of this series,
but Friday night at home they shot 27 ... in the fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Overwhelmingly, the referees are terrific at a next-to-impossible
job. And the three men assigned to call Friday's Game 6--Dick
Bavetta, Bob Delaney and Ted Bernhardt--are three of the best in the
game.</LD>
<TE>   But to ignore the role officiating played in Game 6 of the NBA's
showcase playoff series would essentially be to ignore the primary
story line in the Lakers' 106-102 victory. And not addressing it
would leave unexamined the swelling chorus of concern among everyday
basketball fans that the league and/or its TV partner, NBC, has an
interest in either helping the league's most glamorous and marketable
team, the Lakers, or at the very least prolonging a dramatic series.</TE>
<TE>   Let me start by declaring I have no ties to Los Angeles or to
Sacramento, and have no rooting interest in the series other than
that I did pick the Lakers to win in six games. And I have zero
tolerance for "conspiracy" stories, that the NBA and NBC conspire to
influence if not straight-up arrange the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Having said that, I have never seen officiating in a game of
consequence as bad as it was in Game 6. It was bad in Game 5 in
Sacramento, when the Kings got the benefit of some very questionable
calls, then unforgivably rotten in Game 6 Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The difficult thing about refereeing an NBA game, compared with
Major League Baseball and NFL games, is that virtually every single
call is subjective.</TE>
<TE>   But the calls made Friday night were just plain wrong, right out
in the open for everybody watching on TV to see, even before replay.</TE>
<TE>   And when I checked my voice-mail late Friday night, I heard
exactly what I expected to hear: outrage. If people watching these
games at home see Scot Pollard fouled out of the game without
touching Shaquille O'Neal, what do we think they think? I know what
they think. They think exactly what Vlade Divac thinks, that
Sacramento would have to have been letter-perfect to win Game 6 in
Los Angeles because there is a larger agenda.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't say that's the reality of the situation. But that is,
increasingly, the perception. And therefore, the NBA has a problem.</TE>
<TE>   This is what happens when you have such a wild disparity in fouls
called from one game to another, ridiculous 180-degree swings from
one game to the next to the next, as if Shaq ramming his elephantine
shoulder into a defender is a foul Wednesday, but not Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The key matchup for Game 7 isn't Kobe vs. Bibby or Peja
Stojakovic's health or the Lakers' three-point shooting; it's how the
referees are going to handle Shaquille O'Neal.</TE>

<HD>Wrong Route to an Airport</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Much of Orange County's public debate over the past decade was
consumed with the plan for a major international airport at El Toro.
Withdrawal symptoms now can be found everywhere after this year's
decisive ballot initiative produced an alternative park plan for the
closed Marine base. In retrospect, we can see just how poorly the
discussion of any future role for Orange County in the regional
aviation picture was conducted.</LD>
<LD>   Three remnants of the airport puzzle fell completely out of play
in recent weeks. Start with the county's airport planning structure,
set up with fanfare and given high-profile independence several years
ago. It became the focus of a turf battle between the Board of
Supervisors and a former county executive. Today it has vanished, its
executive director bought out and many of its employees absorbed into
other county departments. Even the most ardent airport supporters
acknowledged that there was no point in having a powerful independent
agency if it had no airport to plan.</LD>
<TE>   A second bellwether is the decision this month by the Southern
California Regional Airport Authority to begin studying ways to
divert Orange County passengers to other regional airport facilities.
The authority did not actually declare an airport at El Toro dead,
and took note of litigation over the parks vote that is intended to
keep the airport idea alive. But for years the thinking of regional
aviation and transportation groups about Southern California airport
capacity was focused on El Toro, and the premise that it would play a
significant role in the region's aviation picture.</TE>
<TE>   It is significant that planners in other counties saw the recent
vote for a park plan as a dagger through the heart of the airport
idea that prompted them to remove El Toro from their blueprints.
Given the obstacles now to the revival of an El Toro plan, the agency
was right to begin thinking about how passengers and cargo from
Orange County would get to other airports in future years.</TE>
<TE>   While the biggest regional agency, the Southern California Assn.
of Governments, still has El Toro in its forecasts, one more legal
defeat certainly will erase it.</TE>
<TE>   While the airport proponents argue in a lawsuit that the park
initiative usurps the planning authority of local county supervisors,
they face a big problem with their reasoning.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative was the very zoning-change remedy suggested by a
Los Angeles judge when he overturned a previous anti-airport ballot
measure. So the question would have to be, if rezoning is not a
solution available to airport opponents, what remedy would remain?</TE>
<TE>   With no solution, it would seem to follow that local officials can
operate beyond the reach of legal challenge by citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, last week, the proponents of an alternative runway plan
for El Toro said that their Reasonable Airport, Park and Nature
Preserve was off the November ballot and maybe for good. These
advocates of a different runway configuration never really made it to
center stage in airport planning, even though it should have been
obvious from the beginning that an alternate airport plan deserved a
close look.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the so-called V-plan proponents largely were relegated to
gadfly status.</TE>
<TE>   So Orange County ended up with a local planning authority that
never took other aviation ideas seriously and eventually folded when
it no longer had any airport to plan.</TE>
<TE>   The people with the other ideas gave up. And regional planners
began scratching El Toro from their plans.</TE>
<TE>   These three developments are now visible as signposts of a
planning process gone haywire.</TE>

<HD>A Real-World Grand Jury?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Orange County's population was overwhelmingly white, the grand
jury was dominated by whites. The 19 members who will be sworn in
July 1 make up a grand jury that has 12 white men and women, but also
includes two Asian Americans, two Latinos and three African
Americans. In comparison, the grand jury now completing its one-year
term comprises 15 whites, one Asian American and three Latinos.</LD>
<LD>   The ethnic mix of the incoming group still doesn't reflect the
reality of a county where whites account for just 51% of the
population. This shouldn't be a simple numbers game, but a grand jury
that strives to mirror the real world would benefit from different
vantage points as it considers indictments and conducts
investigations designed to keep local government honest and
efficient.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Superior Court, which recruits grand jury
members, deserves credit for strengthening efforts to reach potential
jurors in the county's fast-growing ethnic communities. The county
advertised in Spanish- and Vietnamese-language newspapers, ran
commercials on television stations that target ethnic groups, and
sent recruitment letters to various organizations with strong ties to
ethnic communities.</LD>
<TE>   The grand jury, though, isn't likely to cast an exact reflection
of the real population. Serving on a grand jury is the equivalent of
a full-time job, but jury members are paid the less-than-grand salary
of $50 a day, so it's understandable that members are more likely to
be retirees with the inclination and time to serve.</TE>
<TE>   The new grand jury's average age will be 62, younger than the last
grand jury, which had an average age of 64. But the grand juror age
is still nearly double the county's median age of about 33.</TE>
<TE>   Whether weighing in on beach pollution, conducting in-depth
studies of how the district attorney's office functions or proposing
initiatives to improve the health and welfare of county residents,
the grand jury serves an important function in a democratic society.</TE>
<TE>   The county soon will begin to recruit potential members for the

<LD>Discord in the workplace is grating under the best of circumstances,
but the acrimony that is dividing UC Irvine's music department is
particularly disconcerting. The feud began in the early 1990s as
classically trained musicians and their jazz counterparts argued over
the department's focus. The dissonance has grown to the point that it
is keeping department members from doing their jobs, much less making
beautiful music together.</LD>
<LD>   The dean of UCI's Claire Trevor School of the Arts has taken the
extraordinary but necessary step of putting the music department into
receivership, a process akin to a failing business seeking shelter in
Bankruptcy Court. Dean Jill Beck has handed the leadership baton over
to two administrators from the school's dance and drama departments,
who will run the troubled operation for the next three years.</LD>
<LD>   Receiverships represent a last resort for dysfunctional university
departments. A visiting UCLA music expert who conducted a 1999 audit
described a crisis-ridden department trapped in a "downward spiral."
The toxic brew included low staff morale, insufficient funding for
programs and an overall lack of vision on the department's direction.</LD>
<TE>   Faculty members can't agree on whom to hire, so no replacements
are arriving as war-weary veterans depart. A festering debate
continues on whether the department should concentrate on music
theory or performance. Some faculty members apparently have crossed
the line and lobbied students to take sides, and the most recent
department chair's term was cut short by the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA visitor cautioned that it would be "criminal and
educationally unethical to allow this department to stay in its
present condition, or worse, erode farther." Unfortunately, things
have gotten worse; the faculty shortage prompted the department not
to accept new voice majors during the current academic year.</TE>
<TE>   Since we're talking about a music department, let's for a moment
consider a school of the arts to be an orchestra. If the cello
section isn't playing the score, the orchestra suffers, as do the
paying customers. The restructuring provides a forum to ask and
answer key questions, including whether the music department focuses
on music theory or performance, the future blend of instrumental and
vocal instruction, and how to eliminate any residual bad blood
created by the jazz versus classical rift.</TE>
<TE>   The dean of the school of the arts also might consider ordering
remaining music department faculty members to lay down their drum
sticks and violin bows and troop over to the UCI Little Theater,
where undergraduates are performing "The Skin of Our Teeth." The
message in Thornton Wilder's satiric play about the human will to
survive might strike a chord with warring faculty members.</TE>

<LD>Re "Power of Pulling Together," Editorial, May 26:</LD>
<LD>   I was both amused and bemused by the array of articles in Sunday's
Times relating to airports and cooperation among cities and regions
of Orange County, Los Angeles County and the Inland Empire.</LD>
<LD>   The editorial makes a very good case for closer interaction among
cities, counties and regions, and even raises the specter of a
developing "Orange Curtain" between north and south Orange County.
Conspicuous by its absence is any mention of the El Toro airport and
its importance to local and regional transportation problems.</LD>
<TE>   In a letter on the same page, Leonard Kranser complains that any
attempt to apply a regional solution to the poorly distributed use of
airport facilities gives Los Angeles bureaucrats control over land
use, traffic control and pollution in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   However, El Segundo and other cities in the noise pattern of LAX
have a different concern. They are trying to counteract the negative
effects of increased air activity over their communities caused by
the decision not to use operable runways at El Toro that already have
been paid for by taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   South County will not admit the striking parallel between South
County residents shutting down El Toro and the attempt at air
transportation improvement by the "bureaucrats from L.A." The
difference is that Orange County bureaucracy is driven by nimbyism
and the Los Angeles bureaucracy is driven by cooperation among
cities. Although 21 cities in North County voted against Measure W,
they were countered by South County voters who, in lemming fashion,
flocked to the polls to produce enough votes to pass it.</TE>
<TE>   Some would say that democracy triumphed, but when the normal
primary voter turnout in North County is compared with the organized,
well-financed and well-oiled pro-development airport foes in South
County, the result is clearly skewed.</TE>
<TE>   About 25% of Orange County voters who live in South County were
able to control the fate of El Toro, affecting not only Orange County
but the entire region. Air transportation woes in Southern California
haven't gone away, and El Toro remains the least expensive, safest
and immediately available solution to Southern California's air
transportation system. It's time to reactivate El Toro.</TE>

<TE>   I am really shocked that Newport Beach police would take the time
to apprehend these poor illegal Chinese aliens who washed up on our
shores. These poor guys should have taken the time to get a consular
matricula card, and then everything would be OK.</TE>
<TE>   Didn't all of the police chiefs in Orange County as well as the
Orange County sheriff vote to accept an invalid foreign ID as a
get-out-of-jail card? That way illegals could open bank accounts, get
a Blockbuster video card, maybe even get a driver's license.</TE>
<TE>   License? Oops--I must have lost my head. They were Chinese. It's
only OK for Mexicans to violate our immigration laws. What was I
thinking? Well, there is hope for these poor Chinese men. They could
always try to apply for asylum at the Mexican Consulate.</TE>

<LD>Re "Story on Catholic Female Priest Wasn't Relevant," Letters, May
26:</LD>
<LD>   Bill Robinson is right to the extent that the Catholic Church
mentioned in your article is not the Roman Catholic Church. However,
Robinson was very unkind. As a Roman Catholic, I was embarrassed by
him and for him. I think that what Robinson is truly upset about is a
woman being ordained a priest.</LD>
<LD>   What most Roman Catholics have known, whether they have liked it
or not, is that women one day will be ordained priests in the Roman
Catholic Church. While I am hardly grateful for the recent scandal
and do not minimize the suffering of the victims, one of the good
things that will come out of it is that women will be ordained
priests much sooner than any of us even dreamed before. Like the
Episcopal Church's "Philadelphia 11" (11 women irregularly but
validly ordained in 1976), Giovanna Piazza's ordination is relevant
to Christians everywhere.</LD>

<LD>Re "Communities Say Keep Out--by Bluffing," May 28:</LD>
<LD>   We moved into a gated community after I stared a burglar in the
eye. We were also tired of beer cans and liquor bottles being thrown
on our lawn, and cars roaring by with mufflers blaring at all times
of night. The constant stream of peddlers pounding on our door wore
us down. We get none of that now.</LD>
<LD>   It is tomb-quiet behind our gates, and we love it. Our neighbors
came here for the same reasons. People seem to think that they have a
right to bother anybody anywhere. People seem to think we are trying
to discriminate against others. But people ought to have a right to
be left alone in their homes. Our only remaining annoyances are
peddlers on the telephone. But voice mail has trimmed that to nil.</LD>
<TE>   Regarding the burglar: We opened our garage door and found our
utility door open. I had goofed and, for the first time in years,
left the doors unlocked. I could see our VCR sitting on the washing
machine. We had interrupted a burglary in progress. Thinking the
burglar had escaped, we violated all the advice and entered the home.
I went to a bedroom and dialed 911. While talking to the dispatcher,
I glanced at the closet and saw the reflection from an eye gleaming
in the light. It was the burglar.</TE>
<TE>   This person was a professional and managed to escape just as the
police arrived. The growing lack of respect for others is the reason
more folks are moving behind gates.</TE>

<LD>Re "Educators Cut Out Extras in Protest," May 17:</LD>
<LD>   I am incensed that teachers are shirking their responsibilities
and shortchanging our kids in order to extort money from the school
districts. Times are tough. Health insurance and workers'
compensation costs are skyrocketing, and our economy is uncertain at
best. School districts are scrambling just to cover the automatic pay
increases that teachers enjoy every few years regardless of
performance. I'm sick of their bellyaching.</LD>
<LD>   Teachers complaining about low pay is akin to surgeons complaining
about all the blood during operations. They chose the teaching
profession, and they accepted positions in these lower-paying
districts. My teacher friends in Santa Ana would love to switch
places with teachers in Irvine, Saddleback or Capistrano, where
they'd enjoy safe campuses, incredible parental support and
well-prepared students.</LD>
<TE>   If teachers think the grass is greener in Garden Grove or Anaheim
because the pay is better, then good riddance. But don't hurt our
kids by childishly refusing to spend an extra hour tutoring students,
grading papers or preparing for open house. Stand tough, school
boards.</TE>

<LD>Re "A View From Above Aids Battle Below," May 13:</LD>
<LD>   A couple of weeks ago you reported that Supervisor Todd Spitzer
was so upset by the illegal grading at the Joplin site that he had
asked Orange County Chief Executive Michael Schumacher to
investigate. Schumacher, of course, is the former chief probation
officer, the very one who applied for the state grant to build the
adjacent Rancho Potrero Leadership Academy in the first place and the
former head of the Probation Department that was responsible for
ordering the illegal grading.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe it is time to ask publicly how the investigation is going.
While we are at it, we could request President Bush to ask Dick
Cheney to conduct an independent investigation into what the White
House knew regarding warnings about imminent attacks from Al Qaeda,
and perhaps even ask Kenneth Lay about the contributions of Enron
into the government's energy policies.</LD>

<LD>Re "Illegal Immigrants' Best Form of ID Is Ingenuity," May 12:</LD>
<LD>   Your article provided an interesting peek into how some illegal
immigrants live. Being an immigrant myself (albeit a legal one), I
have always had a lot of sympathy for the hard-working Mexican
nationals who richly contribute to the fabric of our society.</LD>
<LD>   However, it is hard for me to conjure up much sympathy for people
who "eke out" a living on about $44,000 net cash income per year, pay
less for a house per month than most people pay for apartment rentals
and endanger others while driving uninsured.</LD>
<TE>   They live a safer and better life in America than they did in
their native land, stay here illegally for 10 years but complain
about having been "carded" at a casino in Las Vegas due to their
perceived discrimination against illegal aliens. Something in your
picture does not add up, and it is called credibility. In my opinion,
you picked the wrong family to depict the plight of the illegal
Mexican migrants.</TE>

<LD>Re "Tax Hike Helps City Keep Its Good Looks," April 18:</LD>
<LD>   Here's an example of awkward priorities in Orange County. Irvine
homeowners gave quick approval to doubling the parcel tax to keep
parks maintained, streets lighted and the city's well-manicured look
intact. The approval that will cost about $70 annually per homeowner
is absolutely astonishing compared to the refusal in recent years to
approve measures that would have benefited public schools at a cost
of $50 or less in taxes each year.</LD>
<LD>   Public education benefits everyone. On an annual basis, Irvine
faces cuts in vital programs. This year's budget includes the loss of
class-size reductions, music, art and sports programs. Other states
support much higher taxes on homeowners' properties to help fund
public education. They have extremely strong schools to prove that
higher taxes work.</LD>
<TE>   Smaller class size and programs in the arts and other enrichment
programs are vital to the success of public school students. I am not
advocating large increases in property tax, but a small amount can go
a very long way.</TE>

<HD>Board Should Act Now to Rid Ocean of Sewage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "O.C. May Vote on Sewage Waiver," May 24: For almost a year, the
Orange County Sanitation District's mantra has been "Wait until the
science is in." Citizens, meanwhile, are demanding that 240 million
gallons of sewage dumped each day into the Pacific off Huntington
Beach and Newport Beach be treated to minimum levels as specified by
the 1972 Clean Water Act. Each time citizens address their city
councils, city representatives who also serve as sanitation district
directors dutifully have repeated that mantra.</LD>
<LD>   Now, after the agency spent $5 million on a scientific study that
proved inconclusive, Placentia Councilman Norman Z. Eckenrode, who
sits on the board, thinks it's "a great idea" to put the waiver issue
on the November ballot for an advisory vote. At the May 15 special
meeting of the sanitation district board, Eckenrode said, "The
scientists provide the science, but we decide the policy." Unless, of
course, the policy decision is tough. Then it's time to stall,
obfuscate and look for political cover.</LD>
<TE>   What the heck are we paying Eckenrode and the rest of these board
members to do, if not to make decisions? The sanitation district has
stated again and again that a decision must be made by July so its
staff can prepare the permit application that's due in December. Now,
conveniently, they're willing to wait for a November advisory vote on
this issue, which will end up costing taxpayers even more money.</TE>
<TE>   If you live in Anaheim, Brea, Buena Park, Cypress, Fountain
Valley, Garden Grove, La Habra, Los Alamitos, Placentia, Santa Ana,
Stanton, Tustin, Villa Park or Yorba Linda, ask your city council
members what they know about this issue and why they've remained
mute. Are they in favor of the continued dumping of pathogens as
allowed by the waiver?</TE>
<TE>   The residents served by the sanitation district deserve better.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Baker</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Sanitation District's dumping of 240 million
gallons of half-treated sewage a day into the ocean is a monumentally
repulsive act. It has created a thick plume of free-floating toilet
refuse in the ocean. The district is entrusted with protecting the
health of the people by cleaning up the county's sewage. Instead, it
uses a waiver to bypass the Clean Water Act. That is negligence of
the most arrogant dimension and a violation of the pubic trust.</TE>
<TE>   In the process of not doing its job, the district has amassed a
$550-million surplus of taxpayer money. So much for its claim that it
can't afford to treat the sewage properly. Fish, whales, dolphins,
swimmers and surfers have to make their way through that sickening
muck. Think about it and then enjoy your next swim and your next
seafood dinner.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Don't Renew Sewage Waiver," Editorials, May 5:</TE>
<TE>   I say amen to your editorial. The Orange County Sanitation
District's own figures show that it has a reserve of $400 million to
$600 million. It will cost each taxpayer $40 a year for full
secondary treatment, which the Clean Water Act demands. More than
16,000 sanitation districts accomplish this--just 34 have waivers. Of
those, Orange County is the largest. Why the foot dragging? Assembly
Bill 1969 would force the district to get rid of the waiver. The
sanitation district has a paid lobbyist fighting this bill. When we
ask people who's for the waiver, nobody raises a hand. It looks like
the district is alone in wanting the waiver, and is spending our
money fighting to keep it.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "A Battle Rejoined in Brea Hills," May 6: Orange County residents
should oppose the Nuevo Energy development in the Brea Hills. The
company's Environmental Impact Report declares that there will be
little impact from building 914 units because it can all be
mitigated. In the EIR, the company documents an additional 10,000
units proposed, approved or under construction in North County.</LD>
<LD>   The thing it can't mitigate is the loss of unique farmland. Nuevo
also has declared that the road it will build over the ridge into
Tonner Canyon (the only migration route left for wildlife into the
Puente Hills) will actually improve the ability of animals to
migrate.</LD>
<LD>   The Board of Supervisors should reject any development that would
have such a negative impact on the quality of life in north Orange
County. The board should support creation of a greenbelt in the hills
from the Santa Ana River to the Los Angeles County line to address
the serious lack of open space.</LD>
<TE>   Compared to the more-affluent South County, there is a lack of
parks and open space in the north that raises serious environmental
and social justice issues that will only be exacerbated as more gated
communities are built on the little remaining open space. The
proposed greenbelt, stretching from the Puente Hills through the
Cleveland National Forest to the coast near San Clemente would
protect the environment and make our county a more desirable place to
live. It would also help to reverse the decline of older cities in
north Orange County by focusing on redevelopment near existing
infrastructure and transportation.</TE>
<TE>   This is our last chance to prevent Orange County from becoming
another Los Angeles.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Tustin Teen in Coma After Overdose on Prom Night," May 21:</LD>
<LD>   By setting a zero-tolerance policy on substance abuse, the Tustin
Unified School District needs to understand something: Demonizing the
use of alcohol, putting it in the same category as drug abuse, makes
illicit drugs all that more attractive to students. No amount of
breath-sniffing, purse-checking and pat-downs can reveal a concealed
dose of a drug like Ecstasy, unless, of course, they propose doing
strip searches and blood tests before school dances.</LD>
<LD>   It's easier for a kid to get Ecstasy than it is to find an adult
to buy a bottle of rum. With zero tolerance, more kids are choosing
to use illicit drugs rather than drink because it is easier to get
away with it. Rather than simply preaching substance-abuse
abstinence, school boards need to promote drug education that is
based on the reality that illegal drug use exists.</LD>
<TE>   Students need to learn they can never be sure about what is in the
drug they are buying, and about how abusing drugs, or using them in
combinations, can cause irreparable brain damage or death.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Teen's One-Night Mistake Carried a High Price," Dana Parsons,
May 22:</TE>
<TE>   Dana Parsons asks if there's "anything new to say about what can
happen" when people use drugs. Apparently there is: In both his
column and in two articles written about the incident, important
facts about how this tragedy could have been prevented were omitted.</TE>
<TE>   Had Cathy Isford not mixed two dehydrating drugs, not taken such
large doses of both of the two drugs, had she tested the MDMA pills
she took, or even drank enough water, it's probable that she would
still be alive.</TE>
<TE>   MDMA use is less risky than other activities that no one would
even think of questioning. Statistics compiled in the United Kingdom
show that the risk of dying as a result of taking MDMA is about 1 in
5 million. To put this in context, the risk of dying as a result of a
horseback-riding accident is about 1 in 3 million.</TE>
<TE>   It's not surprising that The Times' objectivity has been
compromised by the distortion resulting from the war on some drugs,
this horribly misguided declaration of war by our country's
government on her own people. But it is disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   Use of or abstinence from a drug is a complicated and personal
decision. Both The Times and the government should share the
responsibility to deliver information to enable people to make this
decision rationally and as safely as possible.  Balance is badly
needed. The Times should be able to avoid encouraging drug use while
still providing information that could save lives.</TE>

<LD>Re "Cypress OKs Seizure of Church Land," May 29:</LD>
<LD>   Bravo to the Cypress City Council for not being bullied into a
decision that would have hurt the citizens of Cypress. Cottonwood
Christian Center bought the land at Walker Street and Katella Avenue
knowing it was zoned for a shopping center. But the church leadership
decided to ignore the law and, instead, tried to bully the city into
letting it build a gigantic church.</LD>
<LD>   From recent events in the Roman Catholic Church, we know that just
because you hold a Bible in your hand doesn't mean you are a decent
and honest person. Pastor Bayless Conley has sent out glossy fliers
that go so far as to compare the situation to the Nazis. How could a
man of God say that land ownership is comparable to the Nazis
murdering 11 million people?</LD>
<TE>   Cottonwood bused in people from around the state, but our Cypress
City Council refused to budge. Always putting Cypress first, it stood
united with most Cypress residents in our belief that a retail center
with its tax-generating stores will help the city maintain its
schools, fire services and other infrastructure. We have never been
prouder to call ourselves Cypress citizens.</TE>

perseverance on the Cottonwood Christian Center issue. They have
provided a unified, reasoned voice throughout the difficult
proceedings. They are representing the best interests of the
residents of Cypress and are not yielding to the loud voices of a
special interest.</TE>
<TE>   They have had the fortitude to withstand the propaganda campaign
that Cottonwood has targeted against our city. I want to thank them
for their tireless efforts to do the right thing for the majority and
not bow to the coercion of an overly zealous minority. The battle is
not yet won, but I have confidence that through our leaders'
strength, the city will prevail.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Church Lawsuits Aim to Sidestep Local Zoning Rules," May 19:</TE>
<TE>   I have been a member of Cottonwood Christian Center for years and
continue to support the construction of our new church with my
hard-earned money. I strongly disagree with Cypress' decision to use
eminent domain to take the land that the church bought at the corner
of Katella Avenue and Walker Street for the purpose of building a new
worship and community center.</TE>
<TE>   It is very wrong for the Cypress City Council to take Cottonwood
Christian Center's land (or anyone's land, for that matter) and give
it to a developer. Private property ownership and religious freedom
are fundamental rights upon which our country was founded.</TE>
<TE>   The city's use of the eminent domain procedures violates the
spirit, if not the letter, of the Federal Religious Land Use and
Institutionalized Persons Act, which is intended to protect churches
from land use discrimination. I am asking Cypress to change its
decision to seize Cottonwood's land and to make Cypress known again
as a community with strong family values and a rich faith tradition.</TE>

<TE>   Re "When Zoning Overrides Freedom of Religion," Letters, May 23:
Have we gone too far? I have religious beliefs, but why is it that
every time there is an issue, freedom of speech surfaces and someone
has an amendment to fall back on? As I travel around Torrance, I see
a church on about every corner, so to say that cities are telling the
churches to get out of town is not a true statement.</TE>
<TE>   Do we need that many churches? Do they pay taxes on their
property? It's like a turf war. Why build a church next to a
racetrack? What's next--the racetrack is exposing kids to betting, so
we might as well close it too? Will the churches decide that we don't
need a racetrack? I say bring on Costco and other stores that will
add value to Cypress. The Cottonwood saga is getting old. Let them
rent space in the store, like the banks do.</TE>
<TE>   Gwen Hageman</TE>
<TE>   Torrance</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The city is not only trying to prevent Cottonwood Christian Center
from using its property, it also is trying to lower the appraised
value of the land and pay millions of dollars less than the land is
worth. Under the federal and state constitutions, governments cannot
take private property, except for public use. And when they do, the
owner is supposed to be justly compensated. Cypress is in gross
violation of the law and is morally wrong. The city is being labeled
by critics as a church-hating center of religious intolerance.
Christians throughout the United States are rallying on this issue.</TE>

he had come back with 250 other retired agents to help out in a
massive undercover Medicare fraud investigation called Durascam.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the biggest crackdown on health-care fraud in
California history, the FBI had set up its own "wellness clinic,"
calling it Western Comprehensive Care.</TE>
<TE>   In the process, it had created a new chapter in bureau history,
using ex-agents in a way they had never been used before and possibly
creating a model for future operations.</TE>
<TE>   Within the FBI, the expanded use of retirees represents a fairly
revolutionary change in thinking. Ex-agents have always been used on
a paid contract basis for routine background checks and other tasks,
but major undercover investigations come as new territory.</TE>
<TE>   In the Medicare fraud investigation, all of the ex-agents, and
sometimes even their wives, were posing as patients in need of
diagnostic tests. Diagnostic labs and medical supply firms that
regularly visited the clinic would later frequently urge the purchase
of unnecessary equipment for the patients, such as wheelchairs or
braces. They often promised kickbacks to FBI agents posing as clinic
workers.</TE>
<TE>   The undercover operation lasted two years, part of a larger
statewide fraud crackdown that resulted in almost 400 arrests.
Durascam alone produced two dozen arrests, and more than 100 other
suspects remain under investigation. FBI agents posing as clinic
doctors were given $180,000 in kickbacks by diagnostic firms to
prescribe such unneeded durable medical equipment as wheelchairs,
oxygen concentrators and body braces.</TE>
<TE>   Chefalo's role was small. He was called in for tests at the clinic
a few times from his home in Newhall. It was a way to help the
bureau, and it was fun to be back in action. Ironically, a real
doctor working for the FBI thought he spotted a real circulation
problem and suggested that Chefalo take some extra tests, but it
turned out to be a false alarm.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't think much about it, but there was already talk that
Durascam might turn into a model for future investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Agent Daniel M. Martino had come up with the idea. He was in
charge of health-fraud operations in the Los Angeles area. And he had
always seen the Society of Former Agents of the FBI as an untapped
resource. So he went to them and asked for volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   "They were unbelievably eager to do this," Martino said. "We
needed a cadre of people we could trust. And who better than
ex-agents? We had hundreds volunteer, and they all did it for free.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question in my mind that we will be calling on them
again in future investigations."</TE>
<TE>   Ex-agents were not always welcomed back so readily. After Sept.
11, hundreds of them called to volunteer their services for anything
that might be needed--answering phones or helping out with menial
chores to free active agents up. There were some hurt feelings when
most of the offers were turned down. But many ex-agents understood.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly there was some volunteerism and a lot of patriotism,"
said Jack Keller, a past head of the ex-agents association in Los
Angeles. "They did pick up a few people with real expertise in
terrorism. But I can tell you the bureau didn't really need most of
us. We just get in the way unless some real expertise is called for."</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, however, the FBI has changed its thinking on
ex-agents. The Justice Department recently gave the FBI authority to
hire agents back in support positions, waiving dual compensation
rules on retirement pay that had blocked the practice in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking for opportunities to do some of this hiring right
now, to free up more active agents for terrorism assignments," said
FBI Assistant Director Ronald Iden, head of the bureau's Los Angeles
division.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, we are looking at hiring back some retired agents
or support personnel. They could be analytical positions, maybe
firearms instructors or training instructors, other support positions
to free up more agents."</TE>
<TE>   The current authorization extends only until Sept. 30, but Iden
said he hopes it will continue after that. And he is also open to the
use of large groups of ex-agents in white-collar investigations
similar to Durascam.</TE>
<TE>   "Dan Martino is a very creative guy, and this idea was a
tremendous one," Iden said. "We already have described this technique
to other offices, and hopefully they will follow suit on cases where
that sort of tactic is useful."</TE>
<TE>   Nick Rossi, a spokesman for the FBI's Sacramento office, is one of
those who already sees the massive use of ex-agents in Durascam as a
potential model for other major fraud investigations.</TE>
<TE>   "The retired agents are an incredible resource for us," he said.
"It's not just on something like this. But on an everyday basis, we
get help from ex-agents who work as private security agents or for
other large organizations and who refer cases to us.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a new agent in charge up here, Michael Mason, and one of
the first things he did was meet recently with the ex-agents here in
Sacramento. As we all adjust to 9/11, we need to look to see if they
may play a larger role. If nothing else, they bring wisdom and
experience that can be useful."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, for those who came out of retirement for their
undercover bit parts in Operation Durascam, it was sometimes just as
simple as getting a nice break from routine.</TE>
<TE>   "They used me as somebody with chest and abdomen pains, and they
used my wife, Nancy, too. She was a good one to use because she had a
stroke three years ago," said Richard P. Phinney, 71, who retired
from the FBI in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   "We have five children and eight grandchildren and we spent a lot
of time with them. My wife and I are also avid duplicate bridge
players. This was a fun break for us. Absolutely. Absolutely.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the challenge of trying to get in there and do the job
right was part of it. Part of my problem was that I was supposed to
be a smoker. We had a real doctor in the clinic, and he and I got
into a big argument about me smoking.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I was concerned, this was the perfect role for
ex-agents. We have all kinds of decrepit-looking people, and they
should see that as a resource they can in all kinds of situations."</TE>

<HD>Bowlers Hope to See Alley Spared</HD>
<DH>Education: Barring a late reprieve, the L.A. school
district will replace the Hollywood Star Lanes with an elementary
campus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was another busy night at the Hollywood Star Lanes and try as he
might, 69-year-old Johann Schuessler couldn't keep up with his wife,
Aldona, 57. She's the bowler in the family.</LD>
<LD>   In the next lane, Bill Kingsbury, Lee Denton and Cletus Young were
enjoying yet another Saturday outing, knocking over a few pins and
laughing at one another's jokes.</LD>
<LD>   Also in the crowd was 26-year-old Ben Cutter, who suddenly became
a center of attention for bowling an almost unheard-of--at least in
this crowd--game of 200.</LD>
<TE>   "If I could ever do this again," Cutter muttered, admitting he
usually shoots half that score.</TE>
<TE>   But overriding the scene was the knowledge that the fun at the
Hollywood Star Lanes is coming to an end.</TE>
<TE>   The landmark bowling alley, established in 1960, is scheduled to
close Aug. 7, the result of an eminent domain proceeding by the Los
Angeles Unified School District to take over the 3-acre parcel where
the bowling alley sits along Santa Monica Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with an expanding enrollment that threatens to surpass
748,000 students next fall, the administrators of the nation's
second-largest school district have started a new facilities program
to relieve overcrowded conditions at many of their campuses.</TE>
<TE>   They say the building program, especially focused in the densely
congested area in the city's central district stretching north from
Wilshire Boulevard to east Hollywood, can relieve the overcrowding.</TE>
<TE>   District officials say that as many as 158 construction projects
are scheduled to deal with the growing enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   At Ramona Elementary School, about three blocks from Star Lanes,
1,200 students are enrolled at the small campus; about 300 others
take buses to as far away as the San Fernando Valley because there is
no room for more.</TE>
<TE>   Officials plan to tear down the bowling alley and build 26
classrooms to augment the space at Ramona.</TE>
<TE>   For several years, district officials have talked with Sam
Barnese, Star Lanes' owner, about acquiring the property, but no
agreement has been reached. District officials and Barnese wouldn't
say how much money was offered during the negotiations. In a recent
interview at the alley, Barnese acknowledged that the district made a
"seven-figure" offer but refused to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   At the 32-lane bowling alley, none of the regulars was against
education or the idea of new classrooms at Ramona. Still, they were
upset that a favorite hangout, where a movie star is occasionally
sighted, must close.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's reprehensible," said Young, 67, a regular who admits
to an average of 165. "I taught my daughter how to bowl here. I
didn't even know it was closing. My daughter sent me an e-mail [about
it] from the East Coast."</TE>
<TE>   "I think it stinks," chimed in Aldona Schuessler. "They don't need
this place for a school."</TE>
<TE>   The Star Lanes, where numerous movies, including "The Big
Lebowsky," were filmed, is a throwback to an era when bowling alleys
were plentiful and games were scored with pencils. Only in recent
years was electronic scoring introduced at Star Lanes, thanks in part
to profits earned from the Coen brothers' movie.</TE>
<TE>   What peeves many at Star Lanes is the apparent contradiction of
abolishing a popular gathering place for families and young
people--especially because the number of bowling alleys in greater
Los Angeles is dwindling--to build additional classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "This just isn't another bowling alley," said Star Lanes waitress
Antonella Cannalire, who hails from northern Italy. "There are very
few places like this, where actors, young people, families, people
from Australia [and] New Zealand can get together."</TE>
<TE>   Though Barnese seems resigned to the alley's closing, other
employees are fighting to keep it open.</TE>
<TE>   Waitress Ziggy Kruse, who is from Hamburg, Germany, said her
petition drive to save Star Lanes has so far netted more than 3,000
signatures. She and others have set up an e-mail address,
savehsl@aol.com, to gain support.</TE>
<TE>   Kruse said she and other supporters of the alley met recently with
City Councilman Eric Garcetti, who represents the area, to press
their case. Their persistence has paid off; they'll have a
face-to-face meeting, scheduled for Monday, in Garcetti's office with
school board President Caprice Young.</TE>
<TE>   According to district officials, however, the effort to save the
bowling alley might be too little, too late.</TE>
<TE>   Young, who represents the area, said district officials used a
site-selection process that included representatives of
community-based organizations and parents who have children at
Ramona. "There was a consensus about this site," she said, noting
that there were few complaints about the decision to acquire the
property.</TE>
<TE>   Only now, she said, has opposition surfaced because the district
has initiated eminent domain proceedings--the procedure by which a
government agency can take over private property if an owner refuses
to sell.</TE>
<TE>   "I've gotten 30 to 40 calls about this, and I completely
understand because I'm a bowling widow," said Young, whose husband
has a 200 average. "I would rather not take the bowling alley, but
that area is that squeezed in [by surging enrollment]."</TE>
<TE>   On the recent Saturday night, patrons mostly growled their
displeasure at the school district's plans.</TE>
<TE>   Only Cutter, the young hipster who bowled a 200 game earlier,
seemed to understand the dilemma facing the district.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a liberal Democrat, and I believe in education," he said. "I
would hate to see this place go, but I didn't sign the petition. My
friends signed, but I didn't."</TE>

<HD>Ruby Bradley, 94; Army Nurse Was 'Angel in Fatigues' for
POWs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Retired Col. Ruby Bradley, an Army nurse who became known as an
"Angel in Fatigues" by caring for fellow captives while she was a
prisoner of war in the Philippines during World War II, has died. She
was 94.</LD>
<LD>   Bradley, who served as a combat nurse during the Korean War and
became the Army's most highly decorated nurse, died Tuesday in
Hazard, Ky., following a heart attack.</LD>
<LD>   On Dec. 7, 1941, the 34-year-old Bradley was serving in the
Philippines as a hospital administrator at Camp John Hay in Baguio,
on Luzon Island, 200 miles from Manila.</LD>
<TE>   After the Army evacuated and the Japanese took over the camp on
Dec. 23, Bradley, a doctor and another nurse hid in the hills.</TE>
<TE>   But they surrendered five days later after they were betrayed by a
couple who helped hide them. They were sent to their former military
post, by then a POW camp.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley helped set up a dispensary, and at great risk she and a
doctor smuggled drugs, including World War I-era morphine, and
surgical instruments from the camp hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "Three days after that, we had an appendectomy," she told the
Washington Post in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   "The Japanese thought it was wonderful we could do all this
without any instruments."</TE>
<TE>   To help a pregnant woman who went into labor, Bradley used a tea
strainer and gauze to anesthetize her with ether.</TE>
<TE>   During her 37 months in captivity, Bradley assisted in 230 major
operations and the delivery of 13 babies.</TE>
<TE>   In September 1943, Bradley was transferred to Santo Tomas
Internment Camp in Manila, where she remained until it was liberated.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people died in the last few months," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "There were several deaths a day, mostly the older ones, who just
couldn't take it."</TE>
<TE>   At the Santo Tomas camp, the military and civilian captives dubbed
Bradley and the other imprisoned nurses who provided them with
medical treatment "Angels in Fatigues."</TE>
<TE>   The POWs subsisted mainly on rice--half a cup in the morning and
half a cup at night--but Bradley shared her limited rations with the
children.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd save part of my food for the children later in the day, when
they started crying and being hungry," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley also learned to be "a pretty good thief. I would take food
and put it in my pockets for the children," she said.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the camp was liberated by the Americans on Feb. 3,
1945, the formerly 110-pound Bradley had shrunk to 84 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Spencer, W.Va., Bradley grew up on the family farm.</TE>
<TE>   She taught school before becoming a nurse in 1933. The following
year, she joined the Army Nurse Corps as a surgical nurse.</TE>
<TE>   After World War II, Bradley worked in several base hospitals and
took advantage of an Army training program in which she earned a
bachelor's degree in nursing education from the University of
California.</TE>
<TE>   A month after the start of the Korean War in 1950, Bradley
returned overseas, working as a combat nurse in evacuation hospitals
as the 8th Army's chief nurse.</TE>
<TE>   At one point during the war, when thousands of enemy soldiers had
overrun American troops and Bradley was dealing with wounded patients
who had been ambushed five miles up the road, a plane was sent to
evacuate her and her patients.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley was the last one on the plane, jumping aboard just as her
ambulance exploded from an enemy shell.</TE>
<TE>   When she left Korea in June 1953, Bradley was given a full-dress
honor guard ceremony, the first woman ever to receive a national or
international guard salute.</TE>
<TE>   When she got back to West Virginia, her home town staged a parade
in her honor.</TE>
<TE>   For her service in two wars, Bradley earned 34 medals, including
two Legion of Merit medals, two Bronze Stars, the Philippine
Liberation Medal and the International Red Cross' prestigious
Florence Nightingale Medal.</TE>
<TE>   In 1958, Bradley became the third woman in Army history to be
promoted to the rank of colonel.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley, who never married, retired in 1963, and spent the next 17
years supervising a private-duty nursing service in Roane County,
W.Va.</TE>
<TE>   She was featured on Ralph Edwards' "This is Your Life" in 1954.
Despite her many honors, she told a reporter in 1991 that she never
saw herself as anyone special.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be remembered as just an Army nurse," she said.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles police were investigating the shooting of a man late

<DL></DL>
<LD>County health officials warned late last week that people suffering
from liver problems or who drink alcohol regularly should avoid
eating raw oysters because of a risk of infection by potentially
deadly bacteria.</LD>
<LD>   The bacterium Vibrio vulnificus was implicated in the recent death
of a 45-year-old man with liver disease.</LD>
<LD>   The unidentified man became ill May 11, one week after eating raw
oysters, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Health
Services.</LD>
<TE>   Individuals with cirrhosis, hepatitis, cancer, diabetes, AIDS or
who take immune-suppressing drugs are especially susceptible to the
bacterium, which occurs naturally in ocean waters, health officials
said.</TE>

<HD>Airport Talks in Two Cities Questionable</HD>
<DH>Law: Newport Beach and Irvine councils say they were
justified in holding closed-door sessions. Public-interest group's
attorney disagrees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Elected officials in two of the cities engaged in Orange County's
airport wars have met behind their respective closed doors to discuss
critical projects and hire consultants without public review, saying
exemptions in their city charters and the state's open-meeting law
allow it.</LD>
<LD>   According to records obtained by The Times, the Newport Beach City
Council in recent months agreed during closed sessions--under the
heading of pending litigation--to spend a total of $55,000 a month
for two lobbyists to push locally and in Washington, D.C., for a
renewal of John Wayne Airport's limits on flights and noise. The
lobbying contracts total $455,000 and end Dec. 31, according to
copies of the agreements. Neither contract vote, nor the earlier
hiring of another lobbyist, was noted in public records.</LD>
<LD>   And in Irvine last week, the City Council held a closed-door
session under the heading of real estate negotiations to discuss the
Navy's plans to sell to private developers 3,700 acres of the closed
El Toro Marine air base. City officials, who want to annex the land,
have hired design and engineering consultants to work on an evolving
plan for parkland and other public uses at El Toro, but they haven't
yet made it public.</LD>
<TE>   The actions come as each city scrambles to sort out strategies
relating to airports: in the case of Newport Beach, to renew noise
and flight limitations at John Wayne Airport, which expire in 2005;
for Irvine, to make sure airplanes never land again at the former El
Toro base.</TE>
<TE>   Under the state's open-meeting law, the public's business must be
conducted in public. There are some exceptions, which the city
officials invoked in conducting their closed meetings. The desire for
secrecy reflects the high stakes in the airport battles, with
officials fearing that involvement by even their own constituents
could compromise their efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Francke, an attorney with the California First Amendment
Coalition, questioned such justifications. He said the state's
open-meeting law is specific about which items can be discussed and
voted on in private. It doesn't allow a city council to meet in
closed session to approve the hiring of lobbyists, he said, or
discuss issues involving property that it isn't planning to buy,
sell, lease or exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact their attorney may have approved or suggested [the
closed sessions] may insulate them against personal liability, but
that's all," Francke said.</TE>
<TE>   And the sensitivity of any issue makes it even more worthy of
public input, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining restrictions at John Wayne Airport has been a battle
in Newport Beach for 30 years. In March, the City Council agreed in
closed session to hire California Strategies, headed by Gary H. Hunt,
a former Irvine Co. executive. The firm, hired as a consultant to the
city's longtime aviation attorney Steve Pflaum, was paid $20,000 a
month for March and April. That amount was increased to $30,000 a
month in May.</TE>
<TE>   Also in May, the Newport Beach council--again behind closed
doors--agreed to hire the Washington lobbying firm of William D.
Lowery for $25,000 a month. Lowery also represents a 10-city South
County coalition that for years fought Newport Beach over a proposed
airport at El Toro. Newport's contract specifies that Lowery cannot
do any work related to El Toro on behalf of the city. The firm also
gets $25,000 a month from the South County coalition, which hired the
Lowery group during a public meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The city has also been paying former Assembly Speaker Curt Pringle
$5,000 a month since September 2000 to lobby local officials for
renewal of noise and flight limits at John Wayne. There was no public
notice of that contract being signed either.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach City Atty. Robert Burnham said he approved the
contracts through a city policy that allows him to hire consultants,
with no cost limit, to help with issues related to litigation. He
said he approved the contracts without council votes. Councilwoman
Norma Glover also said no votes were taken; but Councilman John
Heffernan said the council did vote during closed sessions on the
lobbying contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't talk about what happened, but I can tell you I voted with
the majority" in approving the contracts, Heffernan said.</TE>
<TE>   Another Newport Beach councilman, Steve Bromberg, said it was his
understanding that when the council votes on contracts during closed
sessions, it is to give staff direction and the vote doesn't need to
be reported publicly. The vote essentially is a straw vote that
doesn't actually authorize the contract, he said. He conceded,
however, that if the council voted against a contract, it wouldn't be
signed.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach's city policy has no provision authorizing the city
attorney to hire consultants without cost limits, according to a
Times review of the policy. Department heads are allowed to approve
consultant contracts that total less than $30,000 if the expenditure
already was approved by the City Council as part of the annual
budget. Contracts greater than $30,000 total must be submitted to the
City Council for approval before the contract is awarded.</TE>
<TE>   Under the state's open-meeting law, a city council can meet
privately to discuss actual or possible litigation and to hire
attorneys to handle lawsuits. Any votes or action taken must be
reported afterward, including the vote or abstention of every member
present.</TE>
<TE>   With real estate negotiations, the criteria are equally specific
for closed sessions: They can be held with official negotiators to
discuss the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of property, and then
are limited to discussing price and terms.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter dated May 23, Assistant Secretary of the Navy H.T.
Johnson told county and Irvine officials that the Navy has no plans
to make Irvine a party to the Navy's disposal of El Toro property.
"Irvine will not benefit directly from property sales nor will it
determine public uses of the property other than through its land-use
authorities," Johnson wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine City Atty. Joel Kuperberg said the closed session on El
Toro last week was appropriate because, even though the city doesn't
intend to buy or lease any of the base property, it hopes to get
future parkland at El Toro from whoever does buy land there. Irvine
is negotiating concessions through the Navy that could help the city
acquire the property, he said, through conditions of escrow or
property rights conveyed to the city.</TE>
<TE>   "Technically, the chain of title may not be to the city," he said.
"This is a variant to saying you want to buy a piece of property. It
is a legitimate basis for going into closed session."</TE>
<TE>   Kuperberg said negotiations ultimately could lead to a transaction
that would need formal approval by the City Council and the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   "The council is not taking any action to preclude review or input
from the residents of Irvine and an ability to change or suspend the
process if the City Council believes, based upon input, that that's
the best thing to do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a state appellate court decision from March, a court ruled that
the San Diego City Council violated California's open-meeting law
when it met several times in closed session to discuss negotiations
for a new stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The court wrote that the council used the Brown Act as a "shield
against public disclosure of its consideration of important public
policy issues of the type that are inevitably raised whenever such a
large public redevelopment real estate-based transaction is
contemplated."</TE>
<TE>   The court added: "The important policy considerations of the Brown
Act must be enforced, even where particular transactions do not fit
neatly within its statutory categories."</TE>

<HD>4 Paraplegic Climbers First to Scale Mt. Shasta</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- A four-member disabled climbing team made history early
Saturday, becoming the first paraplegic climbers to reach the
14,162-foot summit of Mt. Shasta.</LD>
<LD>   The team of climbers, each disabled in previous skiing, car or
climbing accidents, reached the snowcapped Northern California peak
Saturday morning, said climber Muffy Davis, 29, of Sun Valley, Idaho.</LD>
<LD>   "We're there. We're on the summit calling from Mt. Shasta. We are
on top of the world," said Davis, a medal-winning member of the
United States Disabled Ski Team.</LD>
<TE>   Davis suffered back injuries in a 1989 ski accident.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still celebrating," she said, while standing on the summit.
"Everyone is just high in general."</TE>
<TE>   The group and its support team, 20 people in all, ascended the
mountain in a seven-day, 4.5-mile climb using "snow pods,"
hand-cranked machines similar to mini-tractors.</TE>
<TE>   The machines, developed by Peter Rieke, 48, of Pasco, Wash., a
disabled climber who joined in on the Shasta ascent and owner of
Mobility Engineering, are expected to open mountaineering to more
climbers with disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Rieke, who broke his neck and back during a 1994 climb, developed
the snow pods over six years with help from friends. In 1998, he
scaled Oregon's 11,240-foot Mt. Hood.</TE>
<TE>   Other climbers to reach the top of Mt. Shasta Saturday included
Mark Wellman, who has climbed El Capitan and Half Dome in Yosemite
National Park, and Keegan Reilly, who reached the summit of
Colorado's 14,433-foot Mt. Elbert last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Wellman, 42, of Truckee, a former national park ranger, suffered a
spinal cord injury in a 1982 climbing accident. His 1989 ascent of
3,000-foot El Capitan with climbing partner Mike Corbett, during
which Wellman pulled himself up the mountain by hand, received
international attention.</TE>
<TE>   Reilly, 21, of Eugene, Ore., an Oregon State University student,
the youngest member of the climbing team, lost the use of his legs

<TE>   Davis said the team began its final ascent at 7 a.m. Saturday. The
climbers, who carried messages of support from around the world,
spent the night about 1,200 feet below the mountaintop.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said the group planned to spend the day on the summit and
begin its descent today, using the snow pods.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to a nice shower, washing my hair, and a nice
cold beer," she said.</TE>

<HD>Redistricting Has Council Squabbling</HD>
<DH>Government: Members are horse trading, seeking advantage in
the decennial redrawing of districts, in which the Westside will lose
a seat.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the Los Angeles City Council undertakes the once-a-decade task of
redrawing district boundaries, members are jockeying for key pieces
of the city, like players in a civic Monopoly game.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Nick Pacheco has his eye on City Hall, while Jan Perry
wants skid row and Ed Reyes is angling for the Convention Center.</LD>
<LD>   Nate Holden wants to take the First AME Church away from Mark
Ridley-Thomas, who says he won't give it up without a fight.</LD>
<TE>   "The question I have is, who's getting Boardwalk and Mediterranean
Avenue?" said UC San Diego professor Steven Erie, who studies Los
Angeles politics. "It's a political Monopoly game and the motivations
that drive it are very personal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth and a church for a
church."</TE>
<TE>   After weeks of angling, council members are set to vote Wednesday
on the final district boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the major changes have already been decided. For example,
council members are set to redraw the 15 council districts to give
Latinos a plurality in five districts, compared with four currently.
They also plan to eliminate Ruth Galanter's Westside district to add
another council district to the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   But the city lawmakers are still haggling over some of the smaller
details, particularly in downtown, where three council districts
meet.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the process, Pacheco proposed taking all of downtown east
of Hill Street away from Perry's 9th Council District in an effort to
secure a number of important structures, including the new Walt
Disney Concert Hall. Pacheco also pushed a plan that would give Reyes
the Convention Center and the new cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   His plan to divide this cluster of major landmarks into three
different districts prompted criticism from Cardinal Roger M. Mahony
and others.</TE>
<TE>   "The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels is an integral part of
the downtown redevelopment," Mahony told city officials. "We are
pleased to be neighbors to the Disney Concert Hall, the Music Center,
the Museum of Contemporary Art and other key institutions that have
chosen to remain in the city's downtown core."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Leiweke, the president of Anschutz Entertainment Group and
Staples Center, also urged the council to keep the central downtown
core together in Perry's district.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite all the tremendous success to date, fragmenting downtown
into multiple council districts would jeopardize this prosperity,"
Leiweke said.</TE>
<TE>   Perry, meanwhile, has accused Pacheco in public meetings of
attempting to take some of her district's most notable assets. "I'm
just one woman fighting to keep my district together," Perry said.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure, Pacheco has backed away from his original plan.
But he says he still wants the Civic Center because it will link the
city's birthplace at Olvera Street, which is in his district, to
nearby City Hall. In turn, Pacheco said he would give Perry his half
of skid row, allowing her to fight for federal funds for the area.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Reyes is no longer staking claim to the cathedral. But
he still wants the Convention Center because he says the events held
there affect his nearby district. He is also asking for Belmont High
School and the half-completed Belmont Learning Center, largely for
the same reason.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all about horse trading," said Erie, the UC San Diego
professor.</TE>
<TE>   It's largely about symbolism and campaign contributions, he said.
"It's what I call resource constituency," Erie said.</TE>
<TE>   While Pacheco and Perry fight over the Civic Center, Ridley-Thomas
and Holden--both of whom are in their last council terms because of
term limits--are battling over key pockets of southwest Los Angeles.
Holden is asking the council to give him the First AME Church, the
Trinity Baptist Church, Baldwin Hills Shopping Center and King Plaza
Shopping Center.</TE>
<TE>   The move, Holden said, will "maximize the voting propensity" of
African Americans in the area. But Ridley-Thomas accused Holden of
raiding his district.</TE>
<TE>   "Get a grip," he told Holden during a recent public hearing on the
matter. "We are not going to sit idly by."</TE>
<TE>   Also seeking the council's assistance is former mayoral candidate
Antonio Villaraigosa, who is considering running against Pacheco for
the 14th Council District seat.</TE>
<TE>   Under a plan championed by Pacheco, some of Villaraigosa's Mount
Washington neighbors would be placed in Pacheco's district, but the
former assemblyman's house would remain in Reyes' 1st Council
District. As result, if Villaraigosa wants to run against Pacheco,
he'll have to move.</TE>
<TE>   "He's taking over the hill but he's cut me out," Villaraigosa
said. "This is the worst sort of politics."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, another battle is brewing over when all the changes
will go into effect.</TE>
<TE>   A panel overseeing the redrawing of City Council districts
recommended last week that implementation of the new districts be
delayed from July until December.</TE>
<TE>   If the delay is approved by the full council, the plan would allow
Galanter to continue representing her coastal district until
December, at which point she would move to her new San Fernando
Valley seat.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand clearly that Council District 6 is going to be moved
to the Valley ... but if you send me there immediately, you are
disenfranchising them," Galanter told the committee.</TE>
<TE>   She added: "Valley residents no more want someone they never voted
for than my residents want to lose the person who has served them for
15 years."</TE>
<TE>   Galanter also noted that if secession is approved by voters in
November, the council will have to redraw the new lines anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant City Atty. Anthony Alperin, however, has advised council
members that they need a "sufficiently compelling" reason to break
from tradition in making the implementation date different from the
date the new lines are approved.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco told his colleagues gathered for the redistricting
committee meeting last week that he thought the potential for the
Valley to secede in November was important enough to warrant a delay,
at least until December.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know, is a vote on secession a big deal around here?" he
asked sarcastically. "Does that make this year a little different
than other years?"</TE>
<TE>   Amid all the turmoil, Councilman Jack Weiss, who headed the
council's redistricting committee, said he hopes his colleagues will
put their differences aside to reach a resolution this week.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the approach should be that the winner takes all,"
Weiss said. "I hope that the parties will realize that there is good
reason to come together."</TE>

<HD>Reward Offered in Theft of 700 Pounds of Dynamite From
Mining Company</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A $5,000 federal reward was offered Saturday for information leading
to the recovery of 700 pounds of dynamite and other explosives stolen
from a mining company in Northern California, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The theft in Scott Bar in Siskiyou County, about 10 miles from the
Oregon border, could have occurred between late April and mid-May,
said Special Agent John Torres of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.</LD>
<LD>   On May 18, owners of the Casci Mining Co. discovered the
explosives missing from a storage locker. They had last checked on
the materials the month before, Torres said.</LD>
<TE>   "Someone breached the locks using sophisticated means," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The reason behind the theft was not known, Torres said. "That's
what makes it disconcerting," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the explosives stolen consisted of dynamite, but about 20%
was det cord, a kind of rope-like explosive that can be wrapped
around things to blow them up, Torres said.</TE>
<TE>   Most, but not all, of the contents in the storage locker were
taken, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're putting the full force of the ATF behind this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have no suspects, and are "looking at all angles,"
including whether the theft was an inside job, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone knows something," Torres said. "Although it may seem
irrelevant, every lead helps."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the ATF sent a notice to all federal explosive
licensees to be extra vigilant regarding the possible use of
explosives in terrorist activities.</TE>
<TE>   The agency warned about selling explosives to anyone who does not
appear to have a "legitimate need for explosives."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information about the theft is asked to call the ATF's
Sacramento office at (916) 498-5100 or (888) ATF-BOMB.</TE>

<HD>Fires Not Hurting Attendance at Griffith Park</HD>
<DH>Crime: The number of visitors to the popular L.A.
attraction remains normal, rangers say, despite 10 incidents of arson
in two months.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Griffith Park visitors are upset and wary about a firebug who's been
trying to burn down the urban oasis, but they're not frightened into
staying away.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's largest municipal park was busy as usual Saturday
with people picnicking, jogging and communing with nature. City park
rangers said the number of visitors has remained normal despite 10
incidents of arson in two months at the heavily used park in the
middle of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "There are a lot of people who love this park and aren't going to
be scared away," Ranger Yin Wong said.</LD>
<TE>   Park-goers interviewed Saturday said they were appalled by the
destructive behavior and are looking for anything suspicious. Many
said they can't fathom why anyone would target such a benign setting
as a city park.</TE>
<TE>   "It has gotten to the point where it's hard for the insanity of
individuals to be unbelievable anymore," said Flori Schutzer of West
Hollywood, a frequent park visitor since 1959. The notion that
someone has been deliberately setting the blazes, which were quickly
extinguished by firefighters, "really hits you on a gut level," she
said while strolling near the park's golf course.</TE>
<TE>   Although the fires occurred in a little-used section of the
4,127-acre park, Antonio and Gracie Torres of Atwater Village said
the danger hits close to home.</TE>
<TE>   "We purposely moved a mile away from here so we could come here
and run," Antonio Torres said.</TE>
<TE>   The couple run almost daily while pushing their 10-month-old
daughter in a stroller, and their routes include some of the dirt
trails where fires have been started.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like bombs had landed there," Gracie Torres said.
"We're very concerned, especially with our baby. Without this, we've
always felt completely safe here."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said patrols have been stepped up in the park, which
attracts 10 million visitors a year, according to its Web site. The
Los Angeles City Council is offering a $10,000 reward for information
leading to the arsonist's capture. There are no suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Wong said the fires have been set in a brush-choked area below
Griffith Observatory "on trails that only a person familiar with the
park would know about."</TE>
<TE>   The arsonist sets the fires between noon and 5 p.m., Wong said,
when low humidity encourages flames to spread. The largest fire
damaged 15 acres.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure this person is getting a lot of excitement out of
watching all this equipment going out there," Wong said.</TE>
<TE>   Runner Darrell Smith of Pasadena said he is outraged and saddened
that someone is torching a park that provides leafy sanctuary for
thousands on any weekend or summer day.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a place where it feels like you're out in the country
without leaving the city," he said. "Every time I hear about another
fire, I say, 'Good grief, why is someone doing this?'"</TE>
<TE>   Dean Joaquin of Simi Valley, said he'll continue to visit the park
with his two young children despite the fires.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as the Fire Department keeps jumping on it, people won't
be scared," he said. "If this were something to do with 9/11, people
would have something to be more concerned about."</TE>
<TE>   James Murphy, a lawyer from Los Feliz out on his weekly walk near
the zoo, said, like most people, he sticks to the lushly landscaped
areas of the park.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel safe," he said, adding that he would probably not feel
that way if he were an equestrian or hiker on the tinder-dry trails
in the park's hills.</TE>
<TE>   Park visitors said they couldn't begin to guess at the arsonist's
motive. "He must be troubled about something else to want to do
this," said Zoey Freeburn of Studio City. "This couldn't have
anything to do with Griffith Park itself."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Slusher, a Palmdale businessman out for a stroll in the sun,
said he sees the fires as a sobering reminder that danger lurks in
unexpected places.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing really surprises me anymore, when you have people putting
razor blades in sandboxes and pipe bombs in rural mailboxes in the
shape of a smiley face," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials are asking anyone with information on the fires to call
arson investigators at (213) 485-6095.</TE>

<HD>Secession Foes Hold 1st Rally in Valley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bucking years of pro-secession fervor in the San Fernando Valley, a
group opposed to breaking up Los Angeles held its first rally in an
Encino park Saturday and then fanned out to supermarkets to preach
the virtues of staying together.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor James K. Hahn, an ardent foe of secession, revved up a crowd
of about 50 people by jabbing his index finger in the air to the
chants of "One L.A., One L.A.!"</LD>
<LD>   The Valley secession proposal headed to the Nov. 5 ballot "looks
like it will increase your taxes and decrease your services," Hahn
said. "They call that Camelot! I call it a recipe for disaster."</LD>
<TE>   The mayor, dressed down in a denim shirt, described his hometown
as "the greatest city in the world" and said Los Angeles is "much
stronger together than divided."</TE>
<TE>   City Council President Alex Padilla, who grew up in Pacoima, also
showed up to promote the cause, ready to hit a nearby Ralphs
supermarket in khaki pants and jogging sneakers.</TE>
<TE>   "For too long, this was a one-sided conversation," he said.
"Secession is a bad deal, and today we are going to begin by going to
the shopping centers, going to the neighborhoods to let people know
what the facts are."</TE>
<TE>   Elderly women in straw hats mingled with young union organizers
with pierced noses, joined in the conviction that splitting up Los
Angeles could jeopardize senior services and jobs for city employees.</TE>
<TE>   Secession opponents, mobilizing under the umbrella group One Los
Angeles, may also face a Hollywood cityhood plan on the November
ballot. The Local Agency Formation Commission, a government agency
studying secession, is slated to decide Wednesday whether to put the
Hollywood proposal before voters.</TE>
<TE>   Support for secession is stronger in the Valley than elsewhere in
the city, according to recent surveys. A Times poll taken in March
showed that 55% of Valley voters favored a breakup, compared with 46%
citywide.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time to fight back," said Florence Orenstein, 75, a retired
insurance agent from Tarzana. If the Valley secedes, she predicted:
"Nothing's going to change, except we'll have more politicians."</TE>
<TE>   After gathering armfuls of literature ("Valley Secession--The more
you know about it, the LESS you like it!"), some volunteers drove off
to the supermarkets. But at least two dozen lingered in the park,
still chatting and munching doughnuts an hour after the TV cameras
left. Several said they had no plans to hand out fliers but just came
to lend support.</TE>
<TE>   Not Williana Johnson, 37, a volunteer from South Los Angeles who
stationed herself on the sun-scorched sidewalk outside a Ralphs on
Ventura Boulevard. Born and raised in Los Angeles, Johnson said she
opposes secession because "there's power in numbers."</TE>
<TE>   "Hi, sir, can I give you some information about One L.A., keeping
L.A. together?" she asked a man in a plaid shirt.</TE>
<TE>   "No, thanks," he said without so much as a backward glance. But
other shoppers accepted fliers. Johnson said her goal was to educate,
not to cajole.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not into confrontations," she said. "People are going to
reach their own decisions."</TE>

<HD>Officials Seek Latino Foster Homes</HD>
<DH>Child services: A recruitment drive is launched as demand
far exceeds available facilities in Ventura County.</DH>

<LD>The frightened 3-year-old brought to Barbara Williams' door late one
night presented a special challenge for the 20-year foster mother.</LD>
<LD>   The trembling child, who had just been separated from his parents,
spoke only Spanish.</LD>
<LD>   "I would have to act out things so he could understand," Williams
said. "Later, I gave him picture books with English words, and sure
enough, he started picking it up. But it was very hard for him."</LD>
<TE>   Social workers had little choice but to place the child with
Williams in Oxnard because there are so few foster homes in Ventura
County operated by adults of Latino descent. Even fewer foster
parents speak Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   It's a problem that the county's Human Services Agency is tackling
head on with a new campaign aimed at increasing the number of
Latino-operated foster homes. Nearly 52% of the 885 children in
foster care are of Latino descent, but only 8% of foster homes
contain Latino adults, said Trish Cavanaugh, director of foster
services for the Human Services Agency.</TE>
<TE>   "Certain foster families work best with certain foster kids,"
Cavanaugh said. "But sometimes you have a kid and you just have to
put them wherever a bed is available."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the cultural gap, social workers are struggling
with a long-term trend of fewer foster homes even as more children
are being taken into protective custody due to suspected abuse or
neglect.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, Ventura County had 341 foster homes. Today, there are
166. Although the Human Services Agency is starting to see an
increase, the numbers are still far below what is needed to make the
best placements for children, Cavanaugh said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials give a number of reasons for the decline in foster
homes. Women, who make up the majority of foster parents, are
entering the work force in growing numbers and are getting
better-paying jobs, they say. Other potential foster parents are
scared off by the challenge of serving as surrogate parent for a
traumatized child who may have significant emotional problems.</TE>
<TE>   Foster parents receive $425 to $597 per month for each child,
depending on the child's age. An additional $50 is paid if a
youngster has physical or emotional problems that require more care.</TE>
<TE>   For many, the money is not enough for the effort required,
Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think at some point the county needs to recognize that they
just have to pay more," the foster mother said.</TE>
<TE>   Because the pay is modest, the people who become foster parents
tend to be motivated by other things.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Jacobs, a 13-year foster mother, fits that description.
The Port Hueneme woman has cared for 50 children who needed temporary
shelter. Along the way, she adopted five children, all siblings.</TE>
<TE>   She is in the process of adopting the sixth, the 2-year-old sister
of the others. She and her husband, Richard, continue to take in
other foster children as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, fostering is a hard job. But any job is hard," Jacobs said,
pausing briefly as she busily prepared dinner for the hungry brood.
"The end result of this is little ones who love you and can call you
Mommy."</TE>
<TE>   County officials have tried various recruiting efforts over the
years, which have largely failed. But Cavanaugh believes the newest
campaign will succeed because the county is approaching the challenge
in a more focused way.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have set recruitment goals for each of the 10 cities in
Ventura County, based on need. Oxnard, for example, places about 109
children into protective custody each year and has 60 available
foster homes. So the goal for that city is 49 new homes, Cavanaugh
said.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all the county's cities need to increase the number of
homes, she said. The exceptions are Simi Valley and Ojai, which
already have a sufficient supply.</TE>
<TE>   The first place officials are targeting is the tiny farm town of
Santa Paula. About 16 children there become wards of the court each
year, but the city has only one foster home.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Charles Campbell, who presides over the Juvenile Court,
recalls once being forced to place a young Santa Paula boy with a
family in Moorpark because that was the closest bed available.</TE>
<TE>   "It was almost impossible for the parent to visit the child
because they had to rely on public transportation, and buses don't
run over Grimes Canyon," Campbell said. "There should be a place to
put these children in the same area or neighborhood where they live."</TE>
<TE>   When there is a cultural gap, the problems intensify, the judge
said. Many children are bilingual until they are placed in foster
care. After living with an English-speaking family for several
months, many youngsters lose their ability to speak Spanish, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell has joined Supervisor Kathy Long and others in the push
to find more homes. He and Long met last week with a group of Santa
Paula activists to spread the word.</TE>
<TE>   The county also is hiring a bilingual recruiter and an ombudsman
who will focus on increasing the number of Latino foster homes. Ads
are running on Spanish-language radio stations and brochures have
been printed in both English and Spanish, Cavanaugh said.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to treat foster recruitment like a business, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, we've been trying to Band-Aid and patch the system,"
she said. "But this is a marketing and public relations problem,
which is a full-time job."</TE>
<TE>   Williams figures she has cared for more than 200 children over the
years. As an African American, she focuses on caring for black
children, although she does not turn anyone away.</TE>
<TE>   There are certain things black children need that other families
might not understand, such as certain foods or hair- and skin-care
items, she said.</TE>
<TE>   She recalls the four teenage girls she took to a beauty shop, at
great expense, to get Jeri curls, a popular style for many black
women.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to look like everyone else. They need that," Williams
said. "They need the same clothes, the same hair, the same style, so
people don't look at them and say, 'Oh, those are the foster kids.'"</TE>

<HD>Bike Club Lets Youths Steer Clear of Gangs</HD>
<DH>By attending anti-drug, anti-violence sessions, San
Bernardino students get free parts to spruce up their low-rider
cycles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vanessa Martinez never met her father, but she has heard stories
about him since she was a little girl.</LD>
<LD>   He was in a gang, her family tells her. He was beaten to death
before she was born, his body found slumped in an abandoned car, his
head on the steering wheel. An old woman discovered him when she
heard the car horn's blare.</LD>
<LD>   That image of her father has haunted Vanessa all her life.
Confused and angry as a child, she thought the one way she could be
close to her father would be by joining the gang life and dying as he
had.</LD>
<TE>   "I had a lot of hate," she said. "I had stupid thoughts in my
head."</TE>
<TE>   For the 13-year-old, who was living in a rough San Bernardino
neighborhood, those thoughts almost became a reality. But then
Vanessa watched her two older sisters get pulled into gangs. And she
saw her mother go to jail for transporting drugs.</TE>
<TE>   This was no way to live, Vanessa decided. And she didn't want to
die.</TE>
<TE>   Her sisters and mother have since joined her in keeping to the
straight and narrow, though it hasn't been easy.</TE>
<TE>   Good thing that Vanessa, who has since moved to western San
Bernardino, has a local low-rider bike club to keep her busy.</TE>
<TE>   Seated atop her blue bike named Precious, her brown hair tied back
in two ponytails, Vanessa said, "You're over [at the club] so much,
you don't even have time to gang bang."</TE>
<TE>   The club is a back room rented out of the Home of Neighborly
Service, a community center on Mount Vernon Avenue. Counselors from
the Westside Prevention Project, a pilot program run by the social
services agency Casa de San Bernardino, use the facility to offer
local youths voluntary anti-drug and anti-violence sessions.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest incentive for youths to participate? Those who attend
the sessions get free bike parts.</TE>
<TE>   Souped up with velvet seats, extra wheels, gleaming handle bars
and twisted chrome forks, the low-rider bikes give youths the chance
to make something of their own while acknowledging the culture of the
streets.</TE>
<TE>   "When you build youth programs, you need to build them in the
cultural context of the community," said Sandy Bonilla, project
coordinator for Casa de San Bernardino. "You need to also look at the
subcultures. One of the subcultures is bikes."</TE>
<TE>   The low-rider bikes, two-wheel equivalents of the well-known cars,
are popular among youths from western San Bernardino, said Louie
Rojas, a counselor at the Westside Prevention Project.</TE>
<TE>   Many come from low-income, single-parent homes. And some, such as
Vanessa, have already seen gang violence through family members and
friends.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these youths wouldn't attend counseling, Rojas said,
unless the bike parts were part of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "We know what brings them in," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The counseling sessions run Mondays through Wednesdays, and are
designed to address the problems neighborhood youths confront every
day--the drug culture and violence that comes with it, teen
pregnancy, HIV and AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to speak their language ... and adjust to the issues of
the time," said Hugo Castellanos, a social worker who attends the
sessions.</TE>
<TE>   In counseling, the 50 or so youths--ages 7 to 17--earn points for
good behavior, being responsible and showing respect for themselves
and others. Each Thursday at the bike club meeting, they trade in
their points for bike parts.</TE>
<TE>   There are no rules on how many points fetch, say, some pedals.
Counselors simply look at the bikes and make estimates about what the
youths need and how much it will cost them.</TE>
<TE>   The only real requirement for the bike club is to show up for
counseling. Those who don't, don't get to participate.</TE>
<TE>   "Most kids are pressured into using drugs or pressured into
fighting," Bonilla said. "They have to maintain a very cool image.
But our bike club gives kids an excuse not to [get involved]. If you
do, you'll get thrown out."</TE>
<TE>   No bike club means no hanging out with friends at Thursday
meetings, no showing off at local auto shows, no grandstanding at
holiday parades.</TE>
<TE>   "That way, we make them try harder," Rojas said.</TE>
<TE>   Bonilla started the Westside Prevention Project more than a year
ago with a $100,000 grant from the San Bernardino County Department
of Behavioral Health.</TE>
<TE>   She said the club has brought more and more youngsters to
counseling, especially since commercials for the club began running
on local cable TV a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Bonilla fields calls from parents and youths nearly every
day.</TE>
<TE>   Marcus Acosta, 14, joined the club a year ago. The eighth-grader
with closely cut, dark brown hair admitted he was a handful in the
past. He was suspended for talking too much in class. And the police
once caught him tagging in the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   But once he got involved in the bike club, Marcus found that
making, maintaining and showboating his bike provided enough of a
distraction to keep him out of trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "You get to build bikes and meet people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Those simple gains can mean everything to a young person, said
Stacia Olguin, 13.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting on her black bike, Stacia said, "Kids see there's better
things to do than getting involved in gangs and getting into trouble
on the street."</TE>
<TE>   Just look at how far Vanessa came, Stacia said, looking over at
her cousin. "She used to have an anger problem. But she knew if she
kept that up, she couldn't go to parades. Now she controls all that."</TE>

<LD>   But in late April, the 17-year-old Japanese American girl was
forced from her home and sent to an internment camp. As World War II
raged abroad, she spent graduation day surrounded by armed soldiers
and barbed wire fences.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, Hagiya got the phone call she had been awaiting for 60
years. A school district official who dug through the old records
told Hagiya she had the highest grades in her class and should,
indeed, have been valedictorian.</LD>
<TE>   On June 14, the 77-year-old Culver City grandmother will don cap
and gown and receive the honors due her.</TE>
<TE>   "I think," she said, "it will go a long way toward healing an old
wound."</TE>
<TE>   Though exact figures are unavailable, Japanese American advocates
estimate there were hundreds of students like Hagiya who missed out
on graduation when they essentially became prisoners of war.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 15 years, at high schools from inner-city Los Angeles
to rural Gilroy, dozens of them have been recognized and, decades
later, handed diplomas. But as these survivors reach their 80s, this
effort to fix an old injustice has taken on added urgency.</TE>
<TE>   "For many of them, it's frankly way too late," said Chris Komai,
spokesman for the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles.
"You are in a race against time if there is a desire to rectify what
happened a long time ago."</TE>
<TE>   At Oxnard High, 11 seniors were sent to relocation camps in 1942.
School officials say they have tried to reach all of them for this
month's recognition ceremony, which is a first for the school. At
least one has died and another can't be found. Others, including one
from Wisconsin, plan to attend.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing black gowns and mortarboards, they will sit among the 2002
Oxnard High graduates. When their names are called, they will walk
across the stage, shake the principal's hand and soak up the crowd's
applause, just as they would have six decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sense of completion for what many consider to be an
important rite of passage into adulthood," said Oxnard High Assistant
Principal Gary Mayeda, whose 79-year-old father, Seiichi, will be
among those honored. "This is one small way I can contribute to my
father and his generation."</TE>
<TE>   A Tense Time</TE>
<TE>   Hagiya doesn't recall hostility from her peers or teachers at
Oxnard High School, where she started as a freshman in 1939. But
there were segregated movie theaters and swimming pools. And laws
prevented Asian immigrants from owning land or marrying outside their
race.</TE>
<TE>   "We were the kind of people who knew our place--we didn't push
things," Hagiya said.</TE>
<TE>   After the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, the climate grew
especially tense.</TE>
<TE>   There were signs at stores that screamed "No Japanese!" The
family's cameras and radios were confiscated as contraband. Hagiya's
older brother, Nagao Fujita, had to leave UC Berkeley because of
orders that all people of Japanese ancestry stay within five miles of
their homes.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't talk about it, but somehow we knew what was planned,"
Hagiya said.</TE>
<TE>   The following April, by order of President Franklin Roosevelt, she
and her family were forced to sell or give away most of their
belongings. They packed what little they could and said goodbye to
their friends, their two-story farmhouse and their springer spaniel,
Goro.</TE>
<TE>   Escorted by soldiers, the family boarded buses headed for a
racetrack in Tulare, where they lived for months, first in a horse
stall and then in a crowded barracks, while they waited to be
transported to the Gila River Relocation Center in Arizona. That was
one of 10 internment camps that, from 1942 to 1947, housed 120,000
people of Japanese ancestry from Washington, Oregon, California and
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   In Tulare, Hagiya met the boy who would become her husband, Paul
Hagiya. In the evenings they would linger by the fence that
surrounded the assembly center. They peered out at a drive-in
hamburger place across the street.</TE>
<TE>   "We would drool," she said. "It smelled so good. We would have
loved to go there."</TE>
<TE>   In June, while Hagiya was still in Tulare, her Oxnard High diploma
came in the mail. School officials had sent the lone document in a
brown envelope, with no explanation or calculation of her final GPA.</TE>
<TE>   After about a year in the Arizona camp, Hagiya got permission to
leave early and attend Southwestern College in Kansas, a United
Methodist school where Paul Hagiya had gone to study to be a
minister.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother gave her $500 in cash and told her to go as far as she
could. Hagiya finished college in three years with a sociology
degree.</TE>
<TE>   She and Paul married in 1945, the night before he left to fight in
the European theater under Gen. George Patton. Like many Japanese
American men who wanted to prove their loyalty to the United States
despite having been treated as prisoners, he enlisted in the Army
immediately after finishing college.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, the couple often moved as her husband served in
different communities as a minister. They spent 16 years in Denver,
where Hagiya earned her master's degree in education from the
University of Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Taught for 20 Years</TE>
<TE>   She worked for 20 years as an elementary school teacher in Denver
and Los Angeles, where the family settled. She raised three children,
one of whom died in a car accident at 23.</TE>
<TE>   Hagiya's husband died in 1983. Her mother and brother, who
returned to Oxnard after the war, and her father also have died.</TE>
<TE>   She now lives alone in a Culver City townhome. She plays bridge,
line dances and visits her 13-year-old grandson Tyler, who lives
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Hagiya will not be alone when she accepts her long-awaited
valedictorian honors. Her daughter, Jan Haruta, and son, Mark Hagiya,
will be with her in the stands, as will her sister-in-law, Lillie.</TE>
<TE>   Top of Her Class</TE>
<TE>   Hagiya rarely talks about life at Tulare and Gila River. She kept
most of the details from her own children. Throughout her life she
has followed an old Japanese philosophy: shikata ganai. If it can't
be helped, make the best of it and press forward.</TE>
<TE>   But in February, Hagiya heard it was the 60th anniversary of
Executive Order 9066, which authorized the Japanese internment. The
date jogged a memory of a wish her brother expressed before his 1989
death: that she find out, at last, where she had stood in her Oxnard
class.</TE>
<TE>   She called Nao Takasugi, a former Oxnard mayor and state
assemblyman, with whom she had grown up in Oxnard and been interned
in Arizona, to see if he could help. He asked a friend in the Oxnard
Union High School District to check into the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The friend tapped Judy Warner, an assistant superintendent in the
school district, to help. She dug out the 1942 yearbook from a vault
and found a picture of the top three scholars, Hagiya among them. In
archives at the school, she found 1942 transcripts for all three
students and computed the GPAs. Hagiya's was the highest, 3.8.</TE>
<TE>   Warner called Hagiya immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "When she told me, it was shock," Hagiya said--"shock because I
did not expect them to follow through that soon. When I hung up the
phone, I sat down and the tears would not stop. It was just
overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   Until then, Hagiya had never heard a word from any school
official. Knowing she is finally to receive her valedictorian honors,
said Takasugi, "brings closure to this part of her life."</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, closure still eludes Marjorie Rodgers Fitzgerald.
She and Hagiya were friends in school and carried on a friendly
academic rivalry. When Hagiya left for the internment camp,
Fitzgerald and another student, who tied for the second-highest
grades in the class, shared the valedictorian title.</TE>
<TE>   "I wrote to Yoshie at the time and told her I knew she would've
been valedictorian," said Fitzgerald, who now lives in Santa Maria.
"I knew in my own mind she had higher grades than I. She was a sharp
cookie."</TE>
<TE>   Some Lingering Regrets</TE>
<TE>   Even now, Fitzgerald struggles with the award she won because the
war took her friend away.</TE>
<TE>   The former classmates have stayed in touch and plan to get
together soon. A couple of weeks ago, Fitzgerald said, she sent
Hagiya a package of things she had saved in an old memory book,
including Hagiya's wedding announcement and letters from the camp.</TE>
<TE>   Fitzgerald said she has often thought of giving Hagiya the gold
valedictorian medal she received that day, but it has her own name
engraved on the back.</TE>
<TE>   Hagiya, touched by her old friend's kindness, said she would never
accept such a gift.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to take away from any of her glory," Hagiya said.
"Just knowing this is enough."</TE>

<HD>Health Budget Under Attack</HD>
<DH>Funding: Davis plan to cut workers who help the poor get
insurance will only further stress system, critics argue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A network of health-care outreach workers that helps 1.1 million poor
families enroll in state health insurance programs is itself ailing.</LD>
<LD>   The outreach workers who comb public schools and community centers
for underprivileged children and their working-class parents in need
of health insurance face a serious funding shortage at a time when
more than 7 million people statewide are underinsured.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis' proposed budget for fiscal year 2002-03
eliminates $12 million in advertising for the Medi-Cal and Healthy
Families insurance programs. That amount includes $6 million for
school- and community-based outreach programs that hire workers to
enroll patients, troubleshoot problems and help with annual renewals.</LD>
<TE>   The state Senate has approved the cut. The Assembly's budget
subcommittee, however, has voted to restore half of the funding. The
matter goes this week to the budget conference committee, where the
fate of the appropriation will be determined before a final spending
package is sent to Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Failure to fund outreach workers would hamper efforts to improve
the health of a vulnerable population and further stress the public
health-care system, advocates said.</TE>
<TE>   "By enrolling eligible individuals in these programs, they get
preventive and ongoing care and no longer will need to get their care
in the emergency room, where problems are much bigger and more
costly," said Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge), a physician.</TE>
<TE>   At Valley Community Clinic in North Hollywood, outreach staff,
known as promotoras, help mostly poor, uneducated Latino families
bridge the language, cultural and financial divide that prevents them
from enrolling in the Healthy Families and Medi-Cal insurance
programs.</TE>
<TE>   The clinic's outreach program operates on a $128,000 annual grant
from the state Department of Health Services, officials said. Eight
promotoras working in 20 public schools have enrolled more than
20,000 children and their parents since the clinic began the outreach
program two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Without the promotoras, we would go back to a time when children
would only see a doctor if they were chronically ill," said Olga
Duran, the clinic's outreach program director. "Sick kids can't
think, can't learn and can't go to school. We would be back to square
one."</TE>
<TE>   At UC San Diego Community Pediatrics, 16 outreach workers have
launched a letter-writing campaign to protest the cuts, said Elaine
Pizzola, program supervisor for the agency's Health Insurance Access
Through Schools project. The agency has enrolled 1,000 children in
its first year of operation.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Cathey, an outreach coordinator with Community Health
Councils Inc., in Crenshaw, said outreach workers are invaluable.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven workers served 676 families, including 1,142 children,
through the clinic's Accessing Benefits for Children Project in the
last fiscal year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Cutting off the funding for outreach is like cutting off your
nose to save your face," he said. "It may save a little money now,
but it will cost a lot in the long run."</TE>

<HD>Mother of Girl Starts Her Own Search</HD>
<DH>Lost: Altadena woman heads north to where the missing
11-year-old's father was found slain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The mother of a missing Altadena girl headed to a town 100 miles
north of Sacramento on Saturday, handing out fliers along the way in
hopes of finding her 11-year-old daughter, a family member said.</LD>
<LD>   Kim Almodovar's trip comes two days after Butte County sheriff's
deputies called off a search for her daughter, Jeanene Bonner.</LD>
<LD>   The girl was last seen with her father, Joaquin "Jack" Garcia, on
May 21.</LD>
<TE>   Police said he and the girl were in Las Vegas before the
35-year-old Garcia was found dead from an apparent self-inflicted
gunshot wound Wednesday in his pickup, parked along a quiet wooded
road near Butte Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Though there's a chance that Jeanene was not with Garcia at the
time of his death, authorities searched in a five-mile radius around
the pickup the day after the grim discovery.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't see any clue that she was there," said Sgt. Andy Duch
of the Butte County Sheriff's Department. "There was no evidence that
anybody was removed."</TE>
<TE>   Duch said there was a considerable amount of blood inside the
vehicle and that pending lab results will determine if it was all
Garcia's.</TE>
<TE>   Erma Bonner, Almodovar's mother, said her daughter was handing out
fliers containing Jeanene's picture along the route that authorities
believe Garcia took.</TE>
<TE>   "She's holding up as best she can," Bonner said of her daughter.
Garcia's brother, Jimmy Garcia, said he was given fliers by Almodovar
and will hand them out in the Downey area, where his brother lived.</TE>
<TE>   "Jack always said that Jeanene was his life," he said. "He lived
for her."</TE>

<HD>Write-Ins Give Long Beach Race a Twist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to election oddities, things don't get much stranger
than in Long Beach, where Tuesday's runoff for mayor features
three--not the customary two--candidates.</LD>
<LD>   And just one name on the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Two of the contenders, the popular but termed-out Mayor Beverly
O'Neill and self-described City Hall outsider Norm Ryan, are running
write-in campaigns. They face Vice Mayor Dan Baker, the only mayoral
candidate whose name voters will see when they cast ballots by mail
or enter the voting booth.</LD>
<TE>   The contest is one of a smattering of local elections around Los
Angeles County on Tuesday, including those for a school bond measure
in the Santa Clarita Valley and twin measures in Pomona to reduce or
eliminate the utility users tax. In Long Beach, Tuesday's ballot
features two other runoff contests, for the 7th District City Council
seat and for the 5th District post on the Long Beach Unified School
District board.</TE>
<TE>   But it is the top-of-the-ticket mayor's race--and the weird
circumstances surrounding it--that will probably give the state's
fifth-largest city a new chapter in the annals of electioneering.</TE>
<TE>   "Long Beach is unique.... I would say Long Beach has the
best-trained write-in electorate anywhere in the United States,"
quipped Cal State Long Beach political scientist Paul Schmidt.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill sailed into largely uncharted waters early last year when,
approaching the end of her second four-year term as mayor, she
decided to seek a third term. Unlike most cities with laws limiting
the number of terms for politicians, Long Beach has an important
exception: It allows write-in candidacies for officials who have
served the allotted two terms.</TE>
<TE>   Starting with the January 2001 news conference in which she waved
a bundle of pencils as she announced her reelection bid, O'Neill's
main campaign effort has been to tell voters how they can reelect her
by writing her name on their ballots. She sent pencils in her
political mailers, which included absentee ballot applications, and
she hammered home her "you can write me in" message at every
opportunity, from candidates forums to the greeting on the telephone
answering machine at her campaign headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Despite strong sentiment for term limits in Long Beach (voters
overwhelmingly approved the limits in 1992 and turned down a measure
to ease them in 2000) and the obvious hurdle for any write-in,
O'Neill got 11,032 votes to come in first among a field of seven in
the April 9 primary. But her 28% of the vote fell far short of the
50%-plus-one needed to win the primary, so she found herself in the
runoff--again as a write-in--with Baker, who finished second with 25%
of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan, a businessman who led the successful 2000 campaign to cut
the city's utility tax, finished third with 23%. He sued to be
included on the ballot, but the judge said the runoff was meant to be
a two-way contest between the top vote getters. The judge also turned
down a similar request by O'Neill, saying the city's ordinance is
clear in prohibiting a termed-out officeholder from appearing on the
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Political scientist Schmidt said the system that produced the
three-way, one-name runoff has turned the primary into "a sort of
exhibition game.... It's a strange system, and I think it needs
fixing."</TE>
<TE>   The situation has posed challenges even for the one candidate who
did make the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Baker, who said he has knocked on nearly 25,000 doors during the
daily precinct walks he has been making since July, worries that
voters will not bother to turn out in the mistaken belief that he, as
the only one on the ballot, has the election in the bag.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can get the turnout, my prospects are great," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Baker, 29, was elected in 1999 to the 2nd Council District seat,
which includes the massive Port of Long Beach, the city's main
economic engine. The port is also a major source of pollution, noise
and truck traffic on the Long Beach Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Baker calls for a tougher stance on port-related environmental
problems. He also would like to see a redesign of the federal
breakwater (which O'Neill opposes) to generate some waves and cleaner
water at the city's beaches. Baker also promises to pay more
attention to the diverse neighborhoods in the city of 461,500, with
emphasis on such "quality of life" services as repairing sidewalks
and trimming trees.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the last decade there has been a lot of focus on trade and
tourism and less on taking care of the people who live here," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   A former customs officer who battled drug trafficking, Baker also
calls for adding 75 officers to the Long Beach Police Department. He
has been endorsed by the Long Beach Police Officers Assn. and by Los
Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca.</TE>
<TE>   Baker acknowledges O'Neill's popularity but downplays her stunning
primary upset. He notes that he carried more of the city's nine
council districts and that "three-fourths of the voters said they
wanted somebody different for mayor.... I think voters are ready for
a change."</TE>
<TE>   Ryan, 40, who brokers and oversees bond programs for cities and
other public entities, offers himself as the finance-savvy outsider.
His "No More Business as Usual" campaign slogan underscores his
promises to overhaul the city charter, streamline city operations
"for maximum efficiency and cost-effectiveness" and halt what he sees
as support for "out-of-town developers at the expense of local
businesses."</TE>
<TE>   His backers include the California Republican Party (this is
technically a nonpartisan race; both Baker and O'Neill are Democrats)
and the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody wants to be the reformer, but I actually know how to do
it," Ryan said. "I review hundreds of municipal budgets a year, and I
certainly know what works."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill, 71, said she needs another four years to finish the work
of reconstructing a city devastated by the aerospace downturn and the
closing of the Long Beach Naval Station.</TE>
<TE>   Since she was first elected in 1994, the former president of Long
Beach City College has pushed to acquire the surplus Navy land,
expand and modernize the port, develop technology-based businesses
and retail centers and turn the city into a tourist mecca. Although
some projects have been successful, scale-backs and delays have
plagued others, including the financially struggling Aquarium of the
Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   "We are totally different today from the city that was dependent
on the Navy and aerospace to one that has a diverse economy and a
very bright future," O'Neill said. "But to go from concept to reality
has been a long and cumbersome process. We have accomplished a lot,
and we can see the light at the end of the tunnel, but we are not
there yet."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill says she would use the next four years to "stabilize our
economy and to start to address the needs of the individual
neighborhoods, which have been neglected for so long because of a
lack of funds," and to tackle housing, transportation and other
issues.</TE>
<TE>   Her backers include the Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce, the
Press-Telegram (the city's local daily newspaper) and former Gov.
George Deukmejian, a longtime friend and neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   Many who closely watch Long Beach politics expect O'Neill to be
the winner Tuesday. That is because of her longshot primary victory
and her popularity with the civic establishment and the city's most
dedicated voters.</TE>
<TE>   The politics watchers also predict a low turnout, a factor that
would favor O'Neill. In the primary, turnout was about 16%, according
to the city clerk's office, but it was higher in the districts that
supported O'Neill--the 3rd, where she lives, and the 5th.</TE>
<TE>   Except for controversies over mailings by two groups outside the
campaigns that prompted the city attorney to file lawsuits saying the
groups violated city campaign contributions law, the mayor's race has
been a relatively polite, subdued affair.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a pretty quiet campaign. There hasn't been much
coverage and not a lot of public activity. It's all being waged in
the mail," said Jeffrey Adler, a veteran Long Beach campaign
consultant who is not involved in the mayor's race.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere Tuesday, voters will decide on Measure E, a $48-million
school bond issue for the Saugus Union School District in the Santa
Clarita Valley. District officials say the money is needed to help
build two high schools and to make improvements on elementary
campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Voters in Pomona will consider two ballot measures.</TE>
<TE>   Measure A would eliminate the utility users tax over a five-year
period and abolish the city's general sanitation fee. Measure B would
reduce the tax from 9% to 8% and reallocate one-eighth of that
remaining 8% to establish a job creation program.</TE>
<TE>   The utility users tax is the city's primary single revenue source,
and Pomona officials say passage of either measure would result in
reduced city services.</TE>

stole an unspecified amount of money from a Washington Mutual bank
branch in Seal Beach on Saturday, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses told police three men entered the bank on Seal Beach

teller's drawer.</LD>
<LD>   They escaped with the cash and fled in a stolen car that was found
abandoned along the southbound lanes of the San Diego Freeway, south

<HD>Government Should Butt Out of Debate on School Mascots</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After spending several days in Washington, D.C., and listening to
friends talk about the real threat of a terrorist attack on the city,
it's good to be back home and see what concerns us on the West Coast.</LD>
<LD>   Such as: whether the state should ban Native American team mascots
from public schools.</LD>
<LD>   The state Assembly took up the question last week, and when the
smoke cleared, 29 legislators supported the idea. Unfortunately for
them, they needed 41 votes.</LD>
<TE>   They left the mascot matter a dead duck, and I say that with all
due respect to ducks.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't a new issue. Several years ago, a Times sportswriter
vowed in print never to use the word "Redskins" in a story again,
even when writing about the Washington football team with that name.
He's no longer working for the paper, but he left the world a better
place.</TE>
<TE>   Years before that, some parents in Mission Viejo were unhappy with
the continuing use of Diablos as the school nickname, because it
meant "devils" in Spanish. That offended their sense of Christian
propriety.</TE>
<TE>   You might think that by playing the wise guy, I'm minimizing the
issue. You'd think otherwise if you knew how much time I've spent
over the years trying to resolve in my own mind this tricky problem.</TE>
<TE>   As is usually the case, I don't belong in either of the major
camps. I don't side with those who say the debate is a big waste of
time and should be ignored.</TE>
<TE>   Nor do I side with those who wax moralistic over it and consign
the naysayers to penance for not agreeing with them.</TE>
<TE>   Here's The Third Way. There's room on the bandwagon if you want to
hop on.</TE>
<TE>   Let's use the ever-popular "Indians" as our example.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't it presumptuous for those of us who aren't of Indian
heritage to say the name isn't offensive, when many Native Americans
show up in public forums and say just the opposite?</TE>
<TE>   If they say they're offended, shouldn't we assume they are?</TE>
<TE>   In my deliberations, I accept as fact that many people are
offended by the name.</TE>
<TE>   Then I ask this question: What about other Native Americans who
aren't offended by Indians, Chiefs or, dare I say it, Redskins?</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, many of them also have come forward and said just
that. They might not like the nicknames, but they've made it clear
the subject just isn't one that interests them. In short, they don't
care.</TE>
<TE>   That leads me to conclude that the nicknames aren't inherently
offensive. If they were, then an overwhelming percentage of people in
the group would be offended. I don't think that's been proved.</TE>
<TE>   So I'm at loggerheads, eh?</TE>
<TE>   Hardly. At moments like that, I urge my brain onward, compelling
it to settle the matter.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that complicated.</TE>
<TE>   And it shouldn't be decided by legislatures. That's too much
government for an issue that doesn't go directly to an infringement
of someone's rights.</TE>
<TE>   The arbiters should be local school officials and parents. And if
I were on a school board, I'd vote to drop a nickname like Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Why? Because those who are offended are passionate about it, not
frivolous. Yes, their sensitivity is much keener than mine (go ahead
and call your team the Swedes, I don't care), but since when are
school nicknames supposed to offend even portions of ethnic groups?</TE>
<TE>   To those who retort, "Hey, it's just a nickname," I'd say that's
exactly the point. Since it is just a simple nickname, what's the big
deal in changing it?</TE>
<TE>   Tradition is the only argument I can think of. Not a small
argument, but not worth the stink. The Stanford Cardinal now has its
own tradition, and the world isn't poorer because its teams are no
longer the Stanford Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Giving up a nickname isn't the equivalent of giving up a
fundamental right.</TE>
<TE>   Nope, the mascot issue doesn't belong in the Legislature. When the
matter is raised at individual schools, officials should defuse ill
feelings and let students vote on a new, cooler nickname.</TE>
<TE>   End of debate. Please?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hansie Cronje, 32, a former South Africa cricket captain banned from
the sport for match-fixing, died Friday in the crash of a small plane
in the Outeniqua mountains along the West Cape of South Africa.</LD>
<LD>   One of his country's most popular cricketers during his playing
days, Cronje achieved notoriety two years ago after admitting his
involvement in rigging matches. He was fired as captain and banned
for life after admitting that he accepted about $100,000 from
bookmakers and offered teammates money to play badly.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this year, Cronje failed in an attempt to get South
Africa's High Court to overturn the ban.</LD>
<TE>   Cronje played 68 Test Matches--official two-inning contests
between two accredited national teams--for South Africa between 1992
and March 2000. He also appeared in 188 one-day internationals and
three World Cups. As national captain, Cronje led the team a record
53 times.</TE>
<TE>   Since February, Cronje had worked as financial manager at Bell
Equipment in Johannesburg. The company sells earthmoving equipment.</TE>

<HD>Mario Lago, 90; Brazilian Poet, Samba Composer and Actor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mario Lago, 90, Brazilian samba composer and poet, died Thursday of
lung failure at his Copacabana beach home in Rio de Janeiro.</LD>
<LD>   Active until last year, Lago wrote more than 200 songs and
appeared in more than 30 television programs and 20 motion pictures.
His most famous song, released in 1942, was "Missing Amelia So Much."
Mourners paraphrased the song during a vigil Friday as "Missing you,
Mario, so much."</LD>
<LD>   Some of his work flowed north, with the Andrews Sisters
popularizing his song "Aurora" in the 1941 Abbott and Costello film
"Hold That Ghost." Lago also worked with Brazilian dancer, singer and
actress Carmen Miranda, who became well known in the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   An ardent Communist, Lago was imprisoned six times during the
military regime between 1964 and 1986. Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso saluted Lago in a statement Friday: "As a composer,
Mario Lago showed, sensitively and delicately, the soul and joy of
the Brazilian people. As a citizen, he fought to build a more just
Brazil--more just for all its children."</TE>

<LD>John Middleton Murry, 75, who penned lyrical science fiction under
the pseudonym Richard Cowper, died April 29 in London after suffering
a stroke, his family announced Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The son and namesake of the famous British literary critic John
Middleton Murry, the younger Murry began writing while at Rencomb
College. After serving in the Royal Navy during World War II, he
completed his education at Oxford University and became a teacher in
1950.</LD>
<LD>   Murry taught for 20 years, during which he wrote six successful
novels, including the critically praised "The Golden Valley,"
published in 1958 under the pen name of Colin Murry.</LD>
<TE>   Eventually abandoning teaching to become a full-time writer, Murry
wrote more than two dozen novels and several collections of short
stories. Critics particularly liked his 1974 mystical work, "The
Twilight of Briareus." The book describes how the explosion of a
supernova in outer space prompts the creation of a paradise on Earth
and details the resulting interactions between aliens and humans.</TE>

<HD>Police Chase Ends With Death of 4-Year-Old</HD>
<DH>Pursuit: Suspect runs red light in downtown L.A., leading
to a chain reaction that kills girl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 4-year-old girl was killed Saturday morning when an auto-theft
suspect being pursued by Los Angeles police ran a red light on a busy
downtown street, causing a chain-reaction accident that knocked over
a traffic light, crushing the girl, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   About 11:30 a.m., the suspect, driving a silver BMW sedan, was
traveling east on 6th Street--with a Los Angeles police cruiser close
behind--when he ran the light at Spring Street and hit a minivan
heading south, said Officer Don Cox, a Los Angeles Police Department
spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   Josephine Arias, 29, who was selling socks a block away at
Broadway and 6th Street, said the suspect and police were speeding.
Police could not say how fast either were going.</LD>
<TE>   The speed limit in the area is 25 mph.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Cmdr. Gary Brennan said a routine investigation has been
opened into Saturday's pursuit, adding that, according to preliminary
information, the chase was "well within policy."</TE>
<TE>   The minivan slammed into the light post, sending it onto the
crowded sidewalk and killing Evelyn Vargas as she stood next to her
mother, Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Salazar, a resident of the nearby Hayward Hotel, watched as
the girl's mother tugged at her arm, but was unable to pull her to
safety. "She was just screaming, 'My girl! My girl! Please help
her!'"</TE>
<TE>   Resident Curtis Lee said he dropped to his knees after seeing the
same thing. "We were all just praying for her," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect, whose name was not released, was seriously injured
and taken into police custody. A man and woman in the van also were
seriously injured and taken to a local hospital, Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   As crowds pooled around the police tape, Arias and other witnesses
told of a high-speed police pursuit through one of Los Angeles' most
vibrant and crowded street scenes, where panhandlers jostle with
shoppers for sidewalk space amid shoe stores, jewelry booths and
liquor marts.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect was driving about 55 mph, with one LAPD cruiser
following close behind and another farther back, Arias said.</TE>
<TE>   "They were wiggling and jiggling through the traffic," she said.
"People were jumping out of the way of the BMW."</TE>
<TE>   Jewelry vendor Sylvia Almaraz was angry that police would take
such a risk.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyday, this area is so busy," she said. "That's why we can't
understand why [the police] were just flying."</TE>
<TE>   According to LAPD policy, the senior officer in the pursuing car
has the responsibility of deciding whether to continue a pursuit.
Among other things, the officer must consider traffic, pedestrians,
and just how dangerous the suspect is, weighing the potential threat
to bystanders against the need to make an arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "They're just plain difficult decisions," Brennan said. "But they
were trying to do the right thing, I can tell you that."</TE>
<TE>   The fatality comes at a time when police chases--and the number of
pedestrians injured in pursuits--are on the rise in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   According to LAPD statistics, pursuits rose to 769 last year from
597 in 2000. Pedestrian injuries climbed to 69 in 2001, nearly double
the number in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The chase, which lasted less than five minutes, began in the 500
block of Wall Street when the suspect nearly hit a patrol car, Cox
said. After he refused to pull over, officers discovered the BMW had
been reported stolen in Hollywood two days earlier, he said.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, Brennan said, the officers called for a helicopter
and backup units, and began pursuing the stolen car over a circuitous
route that ended less than two miles later. The crash occurred before
a helicopter arrived.</TE>
<TE>   The names of the officers involved were not released, and the
officers are still on duty, police said.</TE>
<TE>   A pipe and a substance believed to be cocaine were found in the
suspect's car, Brennan said. He had not been charged Saturday night,
but he could face charges of vehicular manslaughter, felony evading
and cocaine possession, he said.</TE>

<HD>H. Potter, 83; Navigator on Doolittle Raid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Henry Potter, who served as Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle's navigator
during the daring bombing raid on Japan that boosted American morale
four months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, has died. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Potter, a retired Air Force colonel, died Monday, the Memorial Day
holiday, after a long illness in a hospital in Austin, Texas, his
home since 1967.</LD>
<LD>   At 8:20 a.m. on April 18, 1942, 16 B-25 bombers began taking off
from the aircraft carrier Hornet 600 miles east of Japan. Doolittle's
bomber was No. 1.</LD>
<TE>   "When we launched, it was stormy, waves breaking over the ship,"
Potter told the Minneapolis Star Tribune in 1992. "Over Japan, it was
a beautiful day. The sun was shining, and I suppose on the ground the
birds were singing."</TE>
<TE>   As Doolittle's raiders flew at low altitude across Japan, they
bombed dozens of military targets in and around Tokyo, Yokohama and
three other cities. Doolittle then led his planes toward airstrips in
south-central China.</TE>
<TE>   It was night by the time they reached the China coast. They had
run into a severe storm and their fuel was gone. Doolittle pulled his
plane up to 8,000 feet and he, Potter and the other crew members
bailed out.</TE>
<TE>   One of the 16 bombers landed in the Soviet Union, according to a
War Department report; the others landed in the water near the China
coast or crashed on land after the crews bailed out.</TE>
<TE>   All 80 crew members made it to the ground safely, but eight of
them were captured by the Japanese, according to the report. Three
were executed, one died in prison and four were released when the war
ended.</TE>
<TE>   The surprise Doolittle Raid stunned the Japanese, who had believed
their homeland was invulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   All of the men had volunteered to work on the unnamed secret
mission.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we exhibited any more courage than anyone else,"
Potter said in 1990. "I don't think any of us thought about anything
other than that we were doing our jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Pierre, S.D., in 1918, Potter attended Yankton College in
South Dakota and the University of Oregon. He entered the Army in
1940. After completing navigator training, he was commissioned a 2nd
lieutenant in June 1941.</TE>
<TE>   Potter, whose wartime decorations included the Distinguished
Flying Cross and Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters, retired from
the Air Force in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, he joined an expedition to China to search for the planes
that were downed after the historic raid on Japan. Among the remains
found were those of the Doolittle bomber.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a wonderful experience for him," said his daughter, Teresa
Potter White. "He had nothing but wonderful thoughts for the Chinese.
They saved their lives, protected and helped hide them from the
Japanese."</TE>
<TE>   Potter, who later flew missions over North Africa, didn't talk
much about his historic bombing run over Japan when his children were
growing up.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very modest man," his daughter said. "When I was young,
it was like pulling teeth to get him to talk about it. I'd say,
'Parachuting in rain and thunder, were you scared?' He'd say, 'I
don't remember.' 'Sure you do.'"</TE>
<TE>   Her father started talking publicly about the famous mission later
in life, though, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "People stopped him all the time," she said. "He loved talking to
people and sharing with them. He loved his country, and believed we
don't want history to repeat itself."</TE>
<TE>   Doolittle's Raiders had their first reunion in 1943 and, with a
few exceptions, they then held one every year. Potter, who attended
every get-together and had served as the group's president, was too
ill to attend the one in April.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his daughter, Potter is survived by his five other
children, Karen Pardue, Cheryl Sharp, Cynthia Gilcrest, Monica Love
and Steven Potter; 10 grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.</TE>

<HD>No Easy Call Deciding Young Killer's Fate</HD>
<DH>Court: For transient's death, judge could send 15-year-old
to hardened youth authority or a school for troubled boys.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What to do with Rocky Mattley?</LD>
<LD>   At age 15, he is a convicted killer who participated in the
beachside slaying of a homeless man. But he is also a baby-faced boy
with no prior criminal record.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors want him locked up for as long as juvenile law allows.
Defense lawyers want him sent to a private school for troubled teens.</LD>
<TE>   The decision rests with Ventura County Superior Court Judge John
E. Dobroth, who is expected to hear testimony Monday from the boy's
psychologist before handing down a sentence. It's no easy call.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a heck of a first offense," said Loyola Law School Professor
Laurie Levenson. "With a juvenile defendant, one of the goals is to
rehabilitate. But you can't ignore the severity of the crime."</TE>
<TE>   The slaying occurred on the night of June 30 after a group of
teens stumbled over a sleeping transient, James Clark, 58, as they
headed to a beach party near Surfers Point in Ventura. The teens
allegedly stole Clark's backpack, then kicked and stoned him. Clark
died after suffering multiple blunt-force injuries that included a
crushed kidney, a broken rib and possible skull fracture.</TE>
<TE>   Police later arrested Mattley, Timothy Becker, 18, and Christopher
Dunham, 19, all of Ventura, and Robert Coffman, 19, of Oak View.
Ventura County prosecutors charged all four with murder, but decided
to prosecute Mattley in Juvenile Court because he was 14 at the time
of the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   During a four-day trial in March, a Ventura police detective
testified that Mattley admitted during a police interview to kicking
"a bum" in the legs and throwing a rock at him. Although defense
lawyers argued that Mattley was tagging along with the older teens,
Dobroth said he had no choice but to convict him of second-degree
murder because he participated in a deadly assault.</TE>
<TE>   Trials for the other teens are expected to go forward later this
year in Superior Court. The suspects face mandatory life prison
sentences if convicted. In Juvenile Court, it's a different story.
There, the goal is to rehabilitate, and the judge has discretion in
deciding placement for a minor.</TE>
<TE>   In Mattley's case, prosecutors are asking Dobroth to send the boy
to the California Youth Authority, where he could be held until age
25, the maximum penalty possible. But defense lawyers say that would
harm Mattley and do nothing to turn him into a productive member of
society.</TE>
<TE>   "Sending Rocky to the youth authority to be housed with much more
hardened criminals, many with violent gang backgrounds, would be the
worst possible alternative," Deputy Public Defender Howard Asher
said. "My goal is to keep Rocky away from that type of environment."</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers have scoured the nation to find a less restrictive
placement and last week were notified that a school for troubled boys
in western Nevada had agreed to take him. The program does not accept
repeat offenders or youths with serious mental health problems, Asher
said. He believes the school would give Mattley the education and job
training he needs to turn his life around.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors say the program is insufficient, in part because
Mattley would be released at age 18.</TE>
<TE>   "He participated in the killing of another person," Deputy Dist.
Atty. Stacy Ratner said. "I don't think a three-year sentence is
appropriate, no matter what your age."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Mattley's father, a parolee, blamed himself for not
creating a better home life for his family and tearfully urged
Dobroth to give his son a fresh start.</TE>
<TE>   Mattley's older brother added that sending the boy to the youth
authority would only harden him. "The place for a flower to be grown
is in a garden, not in a pile of rocks," he told the judge.</TE>
<TE>   But Clark's bereaved family members urged Dobroth to focus on the
brutality of the crime and its apparent motive. Prosecutors contend
the teens kicked and beat Clark for entertainment as he lay on the
ground in a sleeping bag.</TE>
<TE>   "There must be punishment for their actions," said nephew Tom
Clark, who asked Dobroth to send Mattley to the youth authority for
as long as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "My Uncle James was homeless, but that doesn't mean he didn't have
a family that loved him," Clark said. "Everyone knew he was just a
kindhearted soul."</TE>

<HD>Crews Making Gains on Forest Fire</HD>
<DH>Blaze: Flames burning near Lake Arrowhead may take days to
quell. Area roads still open.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A large wildfire in the San Bernardino National Forest continued to
burn late Saturday, but firefighters made significant headway in
surrounding the blaze, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   As of 8:30 p.m., the Lake Arrowhead-area fire was 40% contained,
said Carol Beckley, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service. "It's
pretty stable right now," she said, adding that it would probably not
be fully controlled until Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze, just a mile from California 18, has charred about 2,500
acres. It began about noon Friday near Waterman Canyon, a short
distance from Arrowhead Springs Resort and Conference Center, fire
officials said.</LD>
<TE>   More than 1,100 firefighters are battling the blaze. No
evacuations or serious injuries have been reported.</TE>
<TE>   Two firefighters have suffered minor injuries battling the
wildfire, Beckley said. Highways leading to and from the Lake
Arrowhead area have remained open.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze might have been caused by a firefighting training
exercise that was held Friday, said Bill Peters, a spokesman for the
California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection in San
Bernardino County, which had been conducting the training.</TE>
<TE>   Flames damaged the west side of the Arrowhead Springs Resort, a
1930s-era hotel that is now used by a Christian ministry. Five small
buildings on the property--four maintenance sheds and a bath
house--were destroyed, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The buildings were near the area where the forestry department was
conducting a controlled burn training exercise.</TE>

<LD>Golden Gate Bridge officials are considering proposals that would
raise the bridge toll from its current $3 per car to $5 to help
reduce the $452-million budget deficit they expect in five years.</LD>
<LD>   Angry commuters at a special meeting Thursday suggested the

<HD>15-Foot White Shark Grabs Surfer in First Bay Area Attack
Since 1998</HD>
<DH>Outdoors: Injuries aren't life- or limb-threatening,
hospital says. Officials close beach for five days.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>STINSON BEACH</DL>
<LD>A Northern California surfer was injured Friday in the first Bay Area
shark attack in nearly four years.</LD>
<LD>   A white shark bit Lee Fontan, 24, of Bolinas at popular Stinson
Beach 20 miles northwest of San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   An Eden Medical Center spokeswoman said Saturday that Fontan was
still in intensive care "with injuries that were neither
life-threatening nor limb-threatening" after shoulder and leg
surgery.</LD>
<TE>   Fontan was surfing about 300 feet from the north end of the beach
when what witnesses said was a 15-foot-long white shark grabbed him
in its teeth. He hit the shark on the nose and got back on his board.
About a dozen other surfers helped him to shore.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked over and this guy was about three or four feet out of
the water in the shark's mouth," surfer John Gilbert, 33, told the
San Francisco Chronicle.</TE>
<TE>   "You could see its teeth, its gums. Its eyes were shut. Its gills
were wide open, like shutters," Gilbert said. "The whole dorsal fin
on its back was out of the water."</TE>
<TE>   National Park Service authorities have barred anyone from entering
the waters at Stinson Beach for at least five days.</TE>
<TE>   The waters where Fontan was attacked are known as the Red
Triangle. Sharks, mostly great whites, feed on seals and other prey
from Bodega Bay to the Farallon Islands in Monterey Bay.</TE>
<TE>   One witness to Friday's attack said dorsal fins often can be seen
circling off the Stinson Beach coast.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen two shark attacks now," said the woman, a waitress at a
cafe on the beach. "If you put in your time at the beach, you're
going to see it happen."</TE>
<TE>   The last time someone was attacked by a shark at Stinson Beach was
in August 1998. Jonathan Kathrein, 16, was boogie boarding on his
last day of summer vacation when a great white shark struck.</TE>

<HD>They Earned Their Diplomas; She Didn't Deserve Her Fate</HD>
<DH>Honors: A Cal State Fullerton grad will also accept a
degree for a sister who died in March. 2002 class is the university's
largest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Chris Holloway walks down the aisle for commencement exercises
at Cal State Fullerton today, he'll be walking for two.</LD>
<LD>   Holloway, 22, who has earned a bachelor's degree in psychology,
also will pick up a diploma for his sister, Kim Holloway, who died
three months ago at age 27.</LD>
<LD>   "It's bittersweet," Holloway said about the graduation ceremony.</LD>
<TE>   University officials decided to award Kim Holloway a degree
posthumously after learning of the sudden death of the English major
and aspiring writer, who was on track to graduate magna cum laude.</TE>
<TE>   "Graduation," Holloway said, "is something she really looked
forward to and wanted so badly to do.... I'm very happy that she's
going to be honored for her work, but I'd rather have her here."</TE>
<TE>   The brother and sister--he in body, she in spirit--are among the
7,900 members of the Class of 2002, the largest graduating class in
Cal State Fullerton's history.</TE>
<TE>   The size of the graduating class led university officials to
spread the ceremony out over the weekend, with half graduating
Saturday and the rest today.</TE>
<TE>   And of course, two ceremonies means two commencement speakers.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Garden Grove) spoke. Today's
graduates will hear from Rep. Edward R. Royce (R-Fullerton).</TE>
<TE>   "You have made it," Sanchez told cheering graduates. "This is what
you've been working for. I look at you and remember my first day in
Congress--there is nothing better than having passion and commitment
in what you do."</TE>
<TE>   For Kim Holloway, the passion burned bright.</TE>
<TE>   Born and reared in nearby La Puente, Holloway was an honor student
at William Workman High School, where she also played soccer, ran
track, loved literature and was involved in broadcast journalism.</TE>
<TE>   After attending Mount San Antonio College in Walnut for two years,
she dropped out to work full time at Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   Then in 2000, she decided to resume her education and enrolled at
Cal State Fullerton, majoring in English.</TE>
<TE>   "She loved writing poetry," recalled her father, Daniel Holloway,
54.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always difficult to work full time and go to school, but she
liked it and was looking forward to graduating and achieving one of
her life's goals."</TE>
<TE>   One morning early in March, she awoke with a pain in her side, her
father said. She went to a doctor, who sent her home suggesting that
she take Tylenol.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-six hours later she was dead, the father said, the apparent
victim of a blood infection caused by a kidney stone.</TE>
<TE>   "We were devastated," the father recalled. "It was all like a
movie--I wasn't even really there."</TE>
<TE>   Today's ceremony is important, he says, because "it sort of
validates where she wanted to go in her life."</TE>
<TE>   Others saw Saturday's commencement as a launching point.</TE>
<TE>   Janea Butler, 24, hopes to use her new degree in child and
adolescent studies to teach elementary school or open her own child
care center. "It's been a long time coming," Butler said.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, her degree is a continuation of a family's drive to
improve its life. Butler's mother, Carrie, 52, four years ago became
the first of 10 siblings--the children of high school dropouts in
Mississippi--to earn a college degree.</TE>
<TE>   "She was my inspiration," Butler said. "There were lots of
mountains and valleys, but now I can see the sunlight."</TE>
<TE>   Shakiba Fimbres, 23, a child and adolescent studies major, is the
first member of her family to graduate from college.</TE>
<TE>   She said she was looking forward to some serious post-commencement
celebrating.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm excited," she said. "We're partying up tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Said theater arts major Sarah Perea, 27: "I feel ecstatic. "I'm
very proud."</TE>
<TE>   Perea has set her goals.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to act," she said. "I'm moving to Hollywood."</TE>

<HD>Operators of Strip Club May Do Time</HD>
<DH>Courts: Pair who converted O.C. Christian haunt to
exotic-dance site face tax-fraud convictions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She was a popular stripper who had saved enough money in tips to open
her own nude club. He was a high-rolling entrepreneur who didn't
think twice about riding in his town's Fourth of July parade
surrounded by dancers from his topless club.</LD>
<LD>   Together, they transformed a quiet Christian dance club in Lake
Forest into one of Southern California's most popular strip clubs.
They planned a chain of elite clubs that they hoped would bring
exotic dancing into the mainstream.</LD>
<LD>   But what seemed a recipe for riches may end in federal prison for
the pair.</LD>
<TE>   Connye G. Morgan, 60, pleaded guilty this year to tax fraud
charges. Mark A. Bailey, 52, was convicted in May of hiding from the
IRS more than $700,000 in strip-club door charges, cocktail tabs and
tips skimmed from dancers.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the two went to elaborate lengths to hide the
sources of their money, stashing $300,000 in cash in a safety deposit
box and claiming their Century City club was financed by former
Lakers star Magic Johnson and Lakers owner Jerry Buss. Both denied
involvement in the club. Bailey's attorney said his client is
innocent and will appeal the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   The saga began in the late 1980s, when Bailey met Morgan at a
strip club near Los Angeles International Airport. The two quickly
began dating, according to court records and interviews.</TE>
<TE>   A stripper who performed well into her 40s, Morgan saved enough
money in tips to open a teen dance club called Jagg in Lake Forest.
The club catered to Christian teens--youths who whiled away weekends
sipping soft drinks and gyrating under flashing lights. The place
made little money because pastors would ask to bring groups in free
of charge.</TE>
<TE>   Bailey, who had worked previously as a computer-systems engineer,
had grander plans for the venue. He convinced Morgan to convert it
into Captain Creams--a bikini bar where patrons downed beer and mixed
drinks as scantily clad women wrestled in pits of shaving cream.</TE>
<TE>   Under the business name Jagg Inc., Captain Creams later went
topless and business started booming. The club earned a reputation as
one of the busiest and most discreet in Southern California.
Customers who used credit cards to buy drinks and dances were billed
under the name of Jagg Restaurant and Bar, instead of Captain Creams.</TE>
<TE>   "We were making a lot of money in those days," said one of the
club's former dancers. "There weren't a lot of other clubs in Orange
County, so we were very busy."</TE>
<TE>   Once, in a demonstration of the club's largess, Bailey offered
$65,000 to an Irvine couple who lacked the money to complete their
castle-style home, which was facing demolition because of city code
problems. Bailey also offered the services of his dancers, who took
up hammers and saws to help out. The plan backfired when the couple
sued Bailey, alleging the construction work was unsuitable.</TE>
<TE>   Bailey told reporters at the time that he helped out of sympathy,
noting that he too faced zoning obstacles when trying to expand his
empire.</TE>
<TE>   While Captain Creams raked in profits, Bailey and Morgan settled
in a well-to-do section of Laguna Niguel. A profile in a local
newspaper portrayed Bailey as a successful businessman and popular
neighbor, who built a gym in his house where his dancers worked out.</TE>
<TE>   Flush with success, the couple made plans to open satellite clubs
in Century City and Corona. Assistant U.S. Atty. Jean Kawahara
charged that Bailey had skimmed profits from Captain Creams to
finance the new clubs, and that he failed to report this "skimmed"
income on his 1992, 1994 and 1995 tax returns.</TE>
<TE>   The cash, according to prosecutors, came from door fees, cocktails
and the strippers. Club policy at the time required that dancers, who
were classified as independent contractors, pay the owners $1 for
every lap dance they performed. That could amount to hundreds of
dollars an evening, according to dancers.</TE>
<TE>   At Bailey's trial, prosecutors charged that Bailey and his former
lawyer hid these profits by depositing the money in bank accounts
small enough to avoid IRS reporting requirements and in safety
deposit boxes.</TE>
<TE>   By using this unreported cash, prosecutors said Jagg opened an
exotic dance club in Century City in 1992. The club, Bailey's 20/20,
was at the former Playboy Club. Bailey reportedly boasted that Magic
Johnson and other celebrities had supplied cash for the operation.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Bailey and Morgan opened a club in Corona, using
more unreported profits, prosectors said. In this case, prosecutors
said that Bailey's lawyer, Alan Curtis, hid $300,000 in profits in a
safety deposit box before eventually paying the club's lease with it.
Curtis has since pleaded guilty to conspiracy and testified against
Bailey at trial.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the operation began to crumble.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Bailey filed for bankruptcy protection. Two years later,
Jagg was sued by the owners of the Corona strip club property, who
alleged Jagg failed to make payments on the property. A judge ordered
that Jagg pay the plaintiff $1.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan and Bailey separated in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Bailey, according to court documents, moved to Cabo San Lucas,
Mexico, where he began operating an exotic dance club and represented
a firm that sells waste water treatment systems.</TE>
<TE>   By that time, however, IRS investigators had begun examining his
books, after they were tipped off by bank employees. Bailey was
arrested in April 2001, after stepping off a plane at LAX. He had
returned from Mexico to visit his parents in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan, through a spokesperson, said Bailey had tricked her into
signing a false tax return.</TE>
<TE>   "She had no idea what was happening," said Les Hawthorne, Jagg's
current chief operating officer. "Even people you love can do you
wrong. She was guilty of felony trusting."</TE>
<TE>   Jurors took one day to deliberate before finding Bailey guilty.
Bailey's lawyer said he is confident the conviction will be
overturned on appeal, claiming Morgan hid the cash.</TE>
<TE>   The appeal is based on the defense being unable to compel Morgan
to testify on his behalf, although the prosecution could call her as
a witness. Prosecutors never exercised that option, and Morgan
invoked her 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination when
Bailey's lawyer called her to the stand.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were able to have her testify she would have absolved my
client," attorney Roger Diamond said. "She was the source of all the
unreported cash. She owned the business and he did not. They weren't
married and, therefore, they had no property in common."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the fall of Bailey's would-be strip-club empire, the
original club, Captain Creams, continues to operate in Lake Forest.
And Hawthorne said business is good.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are the way they were intended to be now. Everything is
good, clean entertainment," he said.</TE>

<HD>Mighty '52 Quake Took Toll in Tehachapi</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CECILIA RASMUSSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clocks stopped at 4:52 a.m. on Monday, July 21, 1952, in the small
railroad town of Tehachapi, nestled in the mountain range separating
two Californias. The earth shivered an hour before dawn, when the
summer sun would rise over Walker Pass like a burning ball to sear
the Mojave.</LD>
<LD>   The epicenter of the rolling temblor measured 7.7 on the Richter
scale and centered on White Wolf Fault southwest of Bakersfield. It
was the most powerful earthquake to hit Southern California in the
20th century and the largest in the nation since San Francisco's in
1906.</LD>
<LD>   Pat Gracey, then 23, was living with her mother in a
70-year-old-home when six subsequent jolts, some as big as magnitude
5, followed within moments and hours.</LD>
<TE>   "The aftershocks felt and sounded like galloping horses right
there in the house," Gracey, now 73, said in a recent interview. She
still lives in town, and her niece lives in that very house.</TE>
<TE>   Screams and children's cries came from a toppled two-story
unreinforced brick building across the street from Gracey's home. One
adult and eight children died there, tearing at the heart of the
town. The earth shook so convulsively that a nearby yellow school bus
bounced in the air like a rubber ball.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the Red Cross and other rescue workers, more than a
dozen long-robed members of the WKFL Fountain of the World--the
Wisdom, Knowledge, Faith and Love cult in Ventura County--braved the
aftershocks to bandage the injured and feed the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Awakened by the temblor and plaster falling from his bedroom
ceiling, Police Chief Hugh Ernst dressed and went into the streets to
assess the damage. In a town with fewer than 2,000 residents, the
toll was frightening: 12 people dead and 35 injured, some critically.</TE>
<TE>   Ernst's fear--along with that of most townsfolk--was what might
have happened at the California Institution for Women, south of town.
At the time, it was the state's only prison for female felons, with
more than 417 inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Seventy guards ushered the sleepy convicts out of the wreckage
without incident. The women spent a day on the lawns in front of the
warden's Tudor-style mansion as members of the military pitched tents
to shelter them for several weeks. Eventually, they were moved to a
newly constructed prison at Frontera, near Chino. Gov. Earl Warren
issued each woman a "good conduct" reward, entitling her to subtract
one month from her sentence.</TE>
<TE>   The railroad, the town's reason for existence and once one of its
largest employers, didn't get off as easily.</TE>
<TE>   Two tunnels with 18-inch-thick walls collapsed east of town,
blocking all train travel for days. Railroad inspectors said that an
eight-mile section of the tracks was "twisted like a licorice stick"
and a 30-foot chasm yawned in the right-of-way.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern Pacific Railroad's water tank bounced off its 15-foot
perch, crushing and flooding the home of railroad worker Woodrow
Newton and his family, who barely escaped.</TE>
<TE>   Police Officer Kirby Bezzo was putting up a pedestrian crosswalk
sign near Gracey's house when he saw his patrol car slide more than
70 feet across the intersection.</TE>
<TE>   Then he heard the blood-curdling screams of Louis G. Martin: "Help
me, help me!" Martin's red-brick, two-story furniture store had
collapsed atop his one-story attached apartment, where his family
slept. Another one-story house, where 16 people lived, also was
crushed. For four hours, neighbors, friends and rescue workers dug
through the three collapsed structures with shovels, hammers,
pocketknives and bare hands. All the while, they listened to the
anguished cries of the buried children. Three of Martin's children,
along with one of his children's friends, were found dead in the
rubble.</TE>
<TE>   Martin's neighbor, Pete Quintana, 40, and his oldest daughter,
Ruth, 17, managed to crawl out. They huddled together near the
wreckage, looking for a sign that the rest of the family would
somehow emerge from the mountain of brick and timber. Quintana's
wife, Blanche, 36, and their nine children had just arrived the day
before from New Mexico, ready to begin a new life in Tehachapi.</TE>
<TE>   One of the children pinned in the rubble worried more about the
rescuers than herself. "Watch out, men, don't get hurt. Because I'm
hurt, don't get hurt yourself," she cautioned.</TE>
<TE>   Four of Quintana's children and two other relatives finally were
freed. But before rescuers could reach his wife, who was crushed to
death under a wooden beam, the last faint cries of one of the
children faded into nothing. Soon, the four remaining children, some
still breathing, were found together in the same bed. Those who were
still alive then died soon after from injuries and dust-filled lungs.</TE>
<TE>   Quintana's brother-in-law escaped injury by leaving the house
moments earlier to get a cup of coffee at a nearby cafe. But another
brother-in-law wasn't so lucky. He was injured when a flying brick
hit him in the head as he slept under a nearby tree.</TE>
<TE>   In Cummings Valley, about 12 miles west of Tehachapi, 16-year-old
Florence Fillmore, a student at Immaculate Heart High School in Los
Angeles, was crushed to death when the walls and roof of a
100-year-old guest house crumbled. Florence, a descendant of Millard
Fillmore, the 13th president of the United States, had served as maid
of honor at the wedding of her sister, Sophia, before the quake
wreaked havoc on the family and wedding guests. Others sleeping in
the same room escaped harm.</TE>
<TE>   The 45-second temblor claimed two other victims: Walter Nolan, who
was scheduled to open his new shoe-repair shop that morning, was hit
by a falling beam in the Summit Hotel. And Ramon Tescador, who lived
over the hill in the town of Arvin, died when he opened his
gas-powered refrigerator, which exploded.</TE>
<TE>   The road into town, California 58, buckled, cracked and wrinkled,
making transportation difficult. The quake triggered landslides in
the canyons and set oil refineries ablaze near Bakersfield, Newhall
and even Long Beach, about 100 miles south of the epicenter.</TE>
<TE>   Brick and adobe buildings were hit hard by the temblor, which
damaged or destroyed 75 homes and 25 businesses. The Tehachapi
Hospital was badly damaged and later torn down. Landmarks such as the
1907 Masonic Temple, the Juanita and Summit hotels, and the Tehachapi
Inn collapsed. In all, the quake inflicted $60 million in damage in
today's dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "The thrust of the Tehachapi earthquake was equal to 1,000
billion-horsepower engines running for one hour," Caltech
seismologist John M. Norquist said.</TE>
<TE>   Within two months after the quake, Caltech had recorded 188
aftershocks of magnitude 4 and higher. Shock waves were felt
throughout the state and in western parts of Arizona and Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Structural engineers and university researchers learned little
from the Tehachapi earthquake, because there were no seismic
measuring instruments that far out. There are now. Tehachapi set
about rebuilding, christening itself the land of four seasons to
highlight its snowy winters and mild summers. Now, the town has a
population of more than 11,000 and the Tehachapi Museum, where
visitors can view photographs and a film of the 1952 earthquake.</TE>

<HD>Laboring on the Backbone Trail</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Volunteers spend National Trails Day sprucing
up part of the roughly 65-mile corridor, almost finished after 30
years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To get work like this, a person usually has to face a judge.</LD>
<LD>   But in the hills above Malibu on Saturday, about 65 volunteers
were spending National Trails Day performing hard labor on one of
their loves, the Backbone Trail.</LD>
<LD>   With shovels and clippers in hand, they spruced up a few miles of
the path near Kanan Dume Road, while brushing away sweat and hungry
ticks.</LD>
<TE>   Most were there, they said, because at some time or another, a
footpath had taken them to some special place.</TE>
<TE>   "The history of trails," volunteer Kurt Loheit said, "is the
history of this country."</TE>
<TE>   Although little known to most in the Southland, the Backbone is
finally nearing completion after 30 years of work. The path will
allow hikers, bikers or equestrians to go from Will Rogers State Park
in the Pacific Palisades up the spine of the Santa Monica Mountains
to Point Mugu State Park in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   About 60 miles of trail are done and another four miles are under
construction. That leaves a gap of two to three miles that could be
finished in the next few years, pending a handful of property
acquisitions by the National Park Service.</TE>
<TE>   "You can come up here from the city and walk for 30 or 40 minutes
on the trail and get the remoteness and wilderness without driving
all the way to the Sierra," said Marcel Gillet, a park service trail
supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the point. The trail is a corridor that gets you back to
nature without damaging the resources."</TE>
<TE>   Work on the trail comes at a time when two bills in Congress
propose a feasibility study on doubling the size of the surrounding
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.</TE>
<TE>   The area was founded in 1978 in response to rampant development in
the Santa Monicas. It was originally intended to connect three state
parks--Topanga, Malibu Creek and Point Mugu--but many other parcels
have since been added.</TE>
<TE>   The park covers most of the western half of the Santa Monicas. But
within that area, about 54% of the land, or 76,000 acres, is still
privately owned with the rest managed by a variety of agencies, most
notably California State Parks and the National Park Service.</TE>
<TE>   The bills--sponsored by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Burbank) and Sen.
Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.)--call for the park service to study a
concept called the "Rim of the Valley Corridor."</TE>
<TE>   If found to be a viable idea, the park service could eventually be
allowed to purchase land from willing sellers, with the most coveted
areas in the Simi Hills and the Verdugo Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to connect the Santa Monicas to the Los Padres and
Angeles national forests in the Santa Susana and San Gabriel
mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Park officials and conservationists are worried that development
would turn the Santa Monicas into an "ecological island," in effect
cutting off wildlife from surrounding habitats the animals
desperately need to survive.</TE>
<TE>   The thinking goes that the more ecosystems are sliced up and
isolated, the more likely it is they'll lose a few key species and
then completely unravel.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an open question how much longer we can enjoy some of the
wildlife with the encroachment that's going on, and that's one of the
incentives to protect this area and make sure it's well managed,"
Schiff said.</TE>
<TE>   When the recreation area was created in 1978, there were
many--even within the park service--who didn't believe the Santa
Monicas were worthy of being managed by the same agency that oversees
treasures such as the Grand Canyon, Yosemite and Yellowstone.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a prejudice that anything that close to L.A. can't be
good," says Joe Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica
Mountains Conservancy.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, the closer the Santa Monicas have been examined, the more
that has been found. There are, for instance, about 450 animal
species in the range. Mountain lions, bobcats, coyotes and mule deer
get top billing, but there's also ringtail, badgers and southern
steelhead trout.</TE>
<TE>   There are also 50 plants or animals whose existence is threatened.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, there are 1,000 known Native American archeological
sites, and it's widely assumed at least a few trails in the Santa
Monicas have been used for thousands of years.</TE>
<TE>   Where today's hikers walk, so did Chumash and grizzly bears.
Hikers say one of the Backbone's main attractions is that those who
walk it will see a little of everything the Santa Monicas have to
offer, from ocean views to eerie sandstone formations to oak
savannas.</TE>
<TE>   Milt McAuley of Canoga Park has seen more than most. The author of
seven field guides, McAuley was one of the early advocates of the
Backbone and spent long days in the 1970s and '80s bushwhacking
through the thick chaparral--no small feat--to determine the best
route for the trail.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten years ago I told the park service that I'm going to be around
to see this thing finished," he said. "They all laughed."</TE>
<TE>   McAuley is 83. In early May he walked the entire length of the
Backbone over seven days.</TE>
<TE>   And on Saturday, with pruners in hand, he walked part of it once
more.</TE>

<LD>"Strengthening the Family" is the theme of the 12th annual Juneteenth
festivities on June 15.</LD>
<LD>   The public is invited to a day of gospel music, African arts and
crafts, food and games.</LD>
<LD>   On June 19, 1865, Union soldiers landed in Galveston, Texas with
news that the Civil War had ended and that the slaves had been freed,
more than two years after the Emancipation Proclamation of January
1863. Juneteenth has since become an African American celebration of
freedom from slavery.</LD>
<TE>   The local Juneteenth festivities will be held at the Oxnard
Performing Arts Center, 800 Hobson Way, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.</TE>

<HD>We Can Tackle Cloning Responsibly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUDITH F. DAAR</AU>
<BD>Judith F. Daar is a professor of law at Whittier Law
School.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush recently reinvigorated the debate about human cloning,
warning in a Rose Garden speech that "allowing cloning would be
taking a significant step toward a society in which human beings are
grown for spare body parts, and children are engineered to custom
specifications."</LD>
<LD>   Pundits surmise that these fiery words were aimed at the 20 or so
senators who remain undecided on whether all forms of cloning should
be banned, or whether federal law should prohibit reproductive
cloning but permit therapeutic cloning, a technique that may lead to
cures for many diseases.</LD>
<LD>   The president's words portend a grim future if cloning is
unleashed, one in which concepts of human dignity, individuality and
autonomy are memories of a bygone era. But will a cloning-filled
future be so bleak? In some ways, we have seen that future, and it is
remarkably unchanged in its respect for human values.</LD>
<TE>   The notion that a person could be cloned for spare body parts
assumes that our current laws prohibiting homicide would be
disregarded. Today's organ transplantation technology is so
sophisticated that it enables living donors to surrender their
kidneys and liver lobes to others.</TE>
<TE>   Yet we are not witness to forced extraction of organs, but rather
enjoy a system in which the donor's informed consent is paramount in
any transplant procedure. Why would a person whose genome matches
that of another be treated differently than any other compatible
donor?</TE>
<TE>   The president speaks of engineering children to meet
specifications. In fact, we have the technology to shape the genetic
well-being of our children and those breakthroughs have been
embraced. Couples can create embryos in a test tube and learn whether
any of their future children carry a genetic mutation.</TE>
<TE>   Using preimplantation genetic diagnosis, parents can ensure the
health of their offspring by implanting embryos that are unaffected
by genetic traits that have plagued their ancestors. Experience has
revealed that these "engineered children" are welcomed and nurtured
for all the same joys and challenges that children of ordinary
conception pose.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of human cloning is repugnant to most Americans
perhaps because it conjures up images of science gone awry, crossing
over some Maginot line that will doom the human species. More
probably, cloning will be, like all new technologies, a small step
along the spectrum of scientific inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Today's fear of cloning has mushroomed into nearly universal calls
for legislative bans. But is a ban on human cloning practical? I
think not.</TE>
<TE>   Human cloning is a genie-out-of-the-bottle phenomenon. We have
heard the claims of Italian fertility specialist Severino Antinori
that a cloned pregnancy is in the works, a full eight weeks along.
Massachusetts biotechnology giant Advance Cell Technology announced
in November that it had succeeded in creating human embryos using
cloning, a feat that has been ongoing in China for two years.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers in the United States have cloned seven species of
animals, claiming great strides in improving safety and efficacy with
each new birth. The crossover to human cloning is close and it is
inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   If we fear a cloning future, then let us meet it with reasoned
readiness. A ban is futile, causing both rogue and respected
scientists to flee to cloning-friendly jurisdictions. Instead, we can
be a leader in promoting the safest possible research environment.</TE>
<TE>   Regulations that impose scrutiny of human trials, laws that
protect against discrimination of cloned individuals, and policies
that show equal respect to all individuals regardless of their
genetic makeup are far more sensible than trying to stop the coming
flood by putting our finger in the dike.</TE>

<TE>   In the 20th century, millions of immigrants came to this country
in search of a better world. Some were adventuresome pioneers,
trailblazers, and leaders seeking fortunes. Today they come for a
better education and freedom for their children, escaping political
turmoil, religious persecution, poverty, and leaving behind their
families and their culture. They face challenges they never expected.</TE>
<TE>   Immigrant families come in search of "The American Dream." They
bring with them the courage and the skills necessary to build a new
life. It is important that they chose to overcome these challenges
and aim to achieve success with family, career, and community,
building a successful place to live. This is what epitomizes that
dream.</TE>
<TE>   The American landscape has changed. We are a rainbow of cultures,
ethnic groups, and races, making us the most diverse place on the
planet.</TE>
<TE>   More than 135 languages are spoken in California. In Orange
County, cities have become satellites of these immigrants' nations.
This is unprecedented in human history.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County is the nation's fifth-most populous county, and the
best place to live in the United States, attracting thousands of
people from all over the world. One in four residents is
foreign-born. Orange County has the fifth-highest number of Latinos
with 775,283. Santa Ana is the second-largest Latino city in the
United States, with a 65% Latino population.</TE>
<TE>   The 21st century presents new opportunities and new challenges.
For some, it is the struggle to achieve citizenship. For African
Americans, Native Americans, and women, it is the reinterpretation of
the dream.</TE>
<TE>   Diversity causes conflict and stress, but it is inevitable. It is
a danger if you resist what is happening, and it is of value if you
embrace it.</TE>
<TE>   The Multicultural Institute for Leadership, with headquarters in
Orange County, is an organization with a mission to reflect the value
of diversity, and it advances that model for leadership.</TE>
<TE>   The institute seeks to soothe multicultural challenges caused by
diversity in business settings, and to transform energies into
multicultural richness, sharing, and common ground.</TE>
<TE>   With an annual convocation and bimonthly leadership forums, the
institute ensures that civic leaders expose themselves to
differences, and that ideas and strategies for multicultural success
remain fresh in the minds of participants.</TE>
<TE>   What needs to happen? Diversity makes good business sense. It is
essential to evaluate diversity from a business perspective,
balancing philosophy and ideology with practicality and practice.</TE>
<TE>   All members of our diverse community can work together toward the
common good while excluding no one.</TE>
<TE>   We need to address these fundamental issues, opening new
opportunities and challenges for social and economic development. We
should focus on regional concerns within a global context, and look
at the fundamental trend shaping the future of our county in the
global marketplace and emerging global culture.</TE>
<TE>   Building tolerance and building relationships across cultural
groups to engage in dialogue with intercultural competent members
will create a healthy society.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders need to discuss the future of diversity and
multiculturalism in the region through dialogues under the contexts
of education, economic development, arts and entertainment, political
empowerment, community participation, law enforcement, journalism and
the media, sports, and health.</TE>
<TE>   Finding common ground yet celebrating differences is a way to
achieve unity. Abraham Lincoln said: "It is not where we come from,
it is where we are going that matters." That is what the American
Dream is all about.</TE>
<TE>   To create unity is the most noble cause and it should be our human
aim.</TE>

<HD>Orioles Appreciate Mariner Relief Effort</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Seattle Mariners' once-dominant bullpen has suddenly become
vulnerable, much to the delight of the Baltimore Orioles.</LD>
<LD>   Jay Gibbons singled in two runs in the bottom of the ninth inning
and the Orioles continued their assault on Seattle's relievers,
beating Kazuhiro Sasaki in a 4-3 victory Saturday night at Baltimore.</LD>
<LD>   Although a throwing error by Sasaki (2-1) contributed heavily to
the two-run ninth, one of the runs was earned--the first earned run
against the Mariner closer in 21 appearances this season.</LD>
<TE>   It was the third consecutive game in which the Seattle bullpen
lost a lead against Baltimore. The Mariners rallied to win the first
one but dropped the last two.</TE>
<TE>   "Stuff like that happens to you. It happened to us last year on
occasion," Mariner second baseman Bret Boone said. "It isn't going to
happen often, but it's going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   With Seattle leading, 3-2, Gary Matthews Jr. led off the ninth
with a single. Chris Singleton bunted, and Sasaki threw wildly to
first base, allowing the runners to advance to second and third.
After an intentional walk to Jeff Conine, Gibbons grounded a single
inside the first-base line.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the kind of wins that do huge things for our club,"
Manager Mike Hargrove said. "It's a positive now and in the long run,
because it makes you feel as if you're always in the game."</TE>
<TE>   Sasaki somberly spoke after his first loss since Aug. 10.</TE>
<TE>   "My job is to get the save and the win. My throw caused the loss,"
he said through an interpreter. "I feel bad right now."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Manager Lou Piniella refused to talk to reporters after
the Mariners' eighth loss in 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 8, Chicago 4--Jim Thome's three-run homer capped a fifth
inning in which host Cleveland scored eight unearned runs and the
Indians sent the White Sox to their sixth consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   Omar Vizquel hit a two-out, two-run single in the fifth for the
Indians, who won their third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Thome's 15th homer--and fourth in three days--concluded
Cleveland's biggest inning since April 7, 2000, and came after
Chicago's infield made two errors behind starter Todd Ritchie (3-7).</TE>
<TE>   Ritchie, who had defeated the Indians twice this season, lost his
fifth consecutive start.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 8, Tampa Bay 3--Barry Zito struck out 11 at St.
Petersburg, Fla., and won his fifth consecutive decision.</TE>
<TE>   Zito (6-2) tied his career high for strikeouts, giving up one run
and seven hits in eight innings.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Hatteberg hit a three-run homer in the eighth inning, giving
the Athletics a 6-1 lead. Hatteberg homered twice at Tropicana Field
on Friday night and has four home runs and nine runs batted in
against Tampa Bay this season.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 3, Kansas City 1--Kenny Rogers pitched a five-hitter and
shut out the Royals until the ninth inning at Arlington, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers (6-3) struck out six and walked one. He gave up the run
when Carlos Febles led off with a double and scored on Mark Sweeney's
groundout.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 4, Detroit 1--Jose Cruz Jr. singled and scored the
go-ahead run, and Darrin Fletcher hit a two-run homer in the 11th
inning at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Politte (1-0) didn't give up a hit and struck out two in
21/3 innings. Kelvim Escobar got his ninth save.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Plate umpire Steve Rippley was released from a hospital at St.
Petersburg, a day after being hit in the left temple by a ball that
deflected off Tampa Bay catcher John Flaherty. X-rays showed Rippley
has a slight nondisplaced fracture.</TE>

<HD>Wilson Steps In to Slam Red Sox</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Enrique Wilson had only 20 minutes to prepare to play. Turned out to
be plenty of time.</LD>
<LD>   Wilson, a late addition to the starting lineup for injured Alfonso
Soriano, hit a tiebreaking grand slam in the sixth inning to lead the
New York Yankees over the Boston Red Sox, 10-2, Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "I was ready to play," Wilson said. "That was unbelievable. I'm
not used to this. Today was the best time I've had in baseball."</LD>
<TE>   The Yankees backed Mike Mussina with four home runs to win for the
19th time in 24 games.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Jeter hit a first-pitch leadoff homer and Jason Giambi and
Rondell White connected later as New York ended Boston's four-game
winning streak and sent the Red Sox to only their fifth loss in 26
road games.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees scored eight runs in the sixth and seventh against the
Boston bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd probably be lying if we tell you we're not concerned," Red
Sox Manager Grady Little said. "We're going to do some serious
investigating here in the near future."</TE>
<TE>   With "Moose" calls filling Yankee Stadium whenever he got two
strikes on a batter, Mussina (8-2) gave up two runs and five hits in
seven innings to win his fifth consecutive decision. Mussina has
three of New York's four victories against the Red Sox this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not complain one bit about run support," Mussina said. "I
was able to keep us right there until we exploded. Sometimes things
get a little contagious. One guy hitting homers leads to another guy
hitting homers. You can't explain it."</TE>
<TE>   Darren Oliver, whose recent struggles cost him his spot in the
rotation, replaced Rolando Arrojo to start the sixth inning and
walked Robin Ventura. With two out, Oliver (4-5) walked Nick Johnson
before Rich Garces came in and hit Jeter with a pitch to load the
bases.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson drove an 0-and-2 breaking ball over the right-center field
fence for his second career grand slam, giving the Yankees a 6-2
lead.</TE>
<TE>   "[Wilson's] a good guy coming off the bench," Manager Joe Torre
said. "He gets himself ready and he has a sense for when he's going
to be needed. Grand slams are a bonus."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson clapped his hands as he rounded first base and watched the
ball clear the wall. Urged on by the sellout crowd of 55,699, the
largest at Yankee Stadium since opening day, Wilson came out of the
dugout for the first curtain call of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "These fans are some of the best in baseball," he said. "To play
with this team and put on this uniform is something special. If we
keep playing this way I think we're going to go all the way."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson's other grand slam came for Cleveland on Sept. 21, 1998,
against New York left-hander Andy Pettitte at Yankee Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "All I heard then was 'Boo!'" Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   Bernie Williams followed with a single and Giambi crushed his
team-leading 15th home run into the right-field upper deck to make it
8-2, then took a curtain call of his own.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson added a run-scoring single and Jeter a sacrifice fly in
the seventh for the second-place Yankees, who cut Boston's lead to
one game in the AL East.</TE>
<TE>   Arrojo, making his first start this season after 15 relief
appearances, had given up only one home run in 341/3 innings. But the
Yankees, who have 15 homers in their last six games and who lead the
majors with 91 homers in 56 games, took him deep twice.</TE>

<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Angels are investigating an incident in which one of their minor
league managers accosted his team's mascot--in the name of good
sportsmanship.</LD>
<LD>   After the Angels' Class-A Cedar Rapids affiliate completed a
series sweep Friday night, the Kernels' mascot--"Mr.
Shucks"--strutted around the field waving a broom.</LD>
<LD>   Cedar Rapids Manager Todd Claus, offended that the mascot was
showing up the opposing team, demanded that Mr. Shucks hand over the
broom.</LD>
<TE>   When Mr. Shucks refused, the Cedar Rapids Gazette reported, Claus
put the mascot into a headlock, yelled a few expletives at him,
wrestled the broom away and then broke it into two pieces.</TE>
<TE>   Angel minor league director Tony Reagins said Saturday he will
look into Claus' actions but did not fault his motivation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a matter of professionalism," Reagins said. "It's a matter
of respecting the opponent and respecting the game. You treat people
the way you want to be treated."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   These are happy times for baseball fans in these parts. The Twins
are in first place, and local authorities are expected to sign an
agreement with major league officials that guarantees the team will
not be eliminated next year.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins may not make as much money as teams in larger markets,
but their rich history includes two World Series championships and
stars such as Rod Carew, Harmon Killebrew and Kirby Puckett.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins also are a regional team, attracting fans from Minnesota
and several neighboring states.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' Darin Erstad grew up five hours away in North Dakota,
and his family often drove here to visit a local theme park and see
the Twins play. His 90-year-old grandfather, Harald Sandness, lives
in North Dakota and would have been crushed by the team's demise.</TE>
<TE>   "What would my grandpa listen to?" Erstad said. "He likes
listening to the Twins on the radio. We don't call him when the Twins
are on."</TE>

<LD>Brian Tracy is an 18-year-old senior pitcher at Claremont High, the
oldest of Dodger Manager Jim Tracy's three sons and a probable
selection in Tuesday's annual draft of amateur players.</LD>
<LD>   However, with an SAT score that is about four times higher than
any Dodger batting average and makes his parents beam, Brian is
likely to accept a scholarship offer from UC Santa Barbara.</LD>
<LD>   Also, at 6 feet 5 and 175 pounds, "looking much like a sparrow" in
his dad's view, the young Tracy probably has some weight work and
filling out to do before trying to fulfill his professional promise.
As Jim Tracy said of Brian and his brother Chad, 16, a junior catcher
at Claremont, "I don't see any indication from the body types walking
around our house that they're into anything they shouldn't be."</LD>
<TE>   He meant there is no indication that they have been sampling any
of the muscle-building or performance-enhancing substances prevalent
even at the high school level as young players feed off the
disgraceful message being sent by many major leaguers and the union
that represents them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's become a terrible problem," said the baseball coach at a Los
Angeles high school. "We do our best to explain the risks, but
whether it's testosterone, growth hormones or anabolic steroids, a
high percentage of high school players are exposing themselves to
serious health problems, and I believe a lot of it stems from the
fact that there's no testing in the big leagues. It's hard to argue
when a kid says, 'If it's all right for them, it must be all right
for us.'"</TE>
<TE>   For years, the mantra of the Major League Baseball Players Assn.
on almost all issues has been that it is trying to protect the rights
of future major leaguers.</TE>
<TE>   The reality is that the basic interest of the intractable union is
in preserving the wealth and spending privileges of the New York
Yankees, making sure the highest salaried players are served.</TE>
<TE>   If its refusal to allow testing makes for a constituency in which
at least half are on steroids, as Ken Caminiti claimed in a Sports
Illustrated story, sending the wrong message to those future major
leaguers, what evidence is there that the union cares?</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the impact of the union's policy on young
players--minor leaguers and high school dreamers alike--is only one
of the damaging results of its ban on testing.</TE>
<TE>   Lacking a random check on steroid use, the apparently widespread
practice--be it by Caminiti's 50% or Jose Canseco's 85%--has served
to degrade every power record of recent years, has turned fringe
players into home run-hammering baseball millionaires, and has
tarnished both those who wear the S on their chests and those who
don't.</TE>
<TE>   The union has also turned its constituency into a secret society
comparable to the old East German athletic machine. The users are
protected by the non-users, despite the moral and criminal overtones
in turning a blind eye to the use of an illegal substance--steroids
are legal in the U.S. only when medically prescribed--and the
consequent health risks.</TE>
<TE>   Those have been proven to include death.</TE>
<TE>   Short of the grave, Caminiti's candid account of the impact
steroids had on his testicles and natural testosterone production
should have chilled every macho clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the players also should have been chilled, or
alarmingly confused, when Gene Orza, one of their union leaders,
appeared on an HBO steroids special two years ago, acknowledged that
steroids could lead to injuries and more time on the disabled list,
but also--in comments widely criticized by medical experts--tried to
say that steroids may not harm adult men, that "most ... health risks
associated with the use of ... steroids are in fact outside the
universe of individuals who play Major League Baseball. They are in
women and the young."</TE>
<TE>   But then, management hasn't been overly aggressive on the steroid
issue either.</TE>
<TE>   Minor leaguers are tested, but counseling and disciplining are
inconsistent, and there is no off-season testing, so players can get
on another steroid cycle without fear of detection.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, management and fans have reveled in the offensive
explosion, there being few questions in a bottom-line business when a
guy suddenly hits 50 or 60 or even 73 home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Didn't Mark McGwire receive Commissioner Bud Selig's Historic
Achievement Award when he hit 70 in 1998 while using the supplement
Androstenedione?</TE>
<TE>   The players like to cite that steroid-condoning atmosphere as a
contradictory breeding ground in which management doesn't hesitate to
inject injured players with cortisone to get them back on the field,
even before they're ready.</TE>
<TE>   But does that justify the apparently rampant use of steroids and
other muscle and performance enhancers?</TE>
<TE>   In a story that appeared in Thursday's editions of The Times, for
example, Milwaukee Brewer Manager Jerry Royster seemed to have lost
touch with all reason when he ignored the health risks, the
illegality of unprescribed steroid use and the moral and ethical
overtones in commenting that as long as there isn't a rule against
it--and isn't that a great post card to send all those young
players?--"don't get on a guy for doing something to make himself
better."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides share responsibility, but it's always management that
approaches the union with testing proposals--this time it's 10 pages,
single spaced--that the union ignores.</TE>
<TE>   This time, given the comments by Caminiti and Canseco, and the
accompanying media onslaught aimed at the union, it will be difficult
for the union to justify its position. The union knows that reducing
steroid use through testing could affect both performance and the
sacred growth of salaries. It also knows that many players would be
angered by testing, affecting the union's solidarity on other labor
issues.</TE>
<TE>   This time, however, it's not likely to go away.</TE>
<TE>   Players of the stature of Curt Schilling, Frank Thomas and Trevor
Hoffman are calling for testing, and Hoffman included a rip at the
union when he said, "The players' association wants people to put up
numbers so they can get paid more. Is that the integrity of the
game?"</TE>
<TE>   The cover excuse for the union's opposition has always been
invasion of privacy and civil rights, and certainly players are
entitled to those considerations.</TE>
<TE>   But they also are paid handsomely--the average salary is more than
$2 million--to perform in the public eye, playing a game that does
not condone cheating beyond the occasional stealing of a sign and in
which the participants are assumed to be free of illegal substances.</TE>
<TE>   It is also an honor and privilege to play major league baseball,
and if there are those who feel their privacy would be invaded by
testing, they can certainly move on to other occupations because
there are many more who yearn for the honor and privilege--and would
welcome the responsibilities that go with it.</TE>

<KH>AROUND THE HORN ROSS NEWHAN</KH>
<HD>Contraction Plans Keep on Moving</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First the news, then the views....</LD>
<LD>   News: The Tampa Bay Devil Rays would replace the Minnesota Twins
on the contraction hit list if the Twins are saved from the 2003
guillotine.</LD>
<LD>   Views: If Major League Baseball was unable to foreclose on the
Twins, who had only one year left on their Metrodome lease, how is it
going to shut down a team that has 25 years remaining? Besides, isn't
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has already lost one anti-trust court
fight with baseball, itching for a rematch?</LD>
<TE>   It was during an April 9 contraction grievance hearing that
Commissioner Bud Selig reportedly said the Devil Rays would replace
the Twins if it came to that, which was at odds with February
comments by MLB Vice President Sandy Alderson, who said the Devil
Rays were not a candidate for elimination because of "reasonably
healthy" local revenues (21st among the 30 teams).</TE>
<TE>   Deciphering the truth is difficult when two baseball officials are
talking at the same time, but it's even harder to believe that
baseball would foreclose on a franchise that is only five years old,
even though the Devil Rays have one of the worst records, the
American League's poorest attendance and an ownership structure that
has been characterized by in-fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Managing general partner Vince Naimoli, reacting to the latest
rumors, said he still considers contraction a good thing because
"there are some markets where I just don't think baseball works" but
"we are not on a list right now and we will not be on a list in the
future."</TE>
<TE>   News: A tentative out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit brought by
the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission against baseball and
the Twins is expected to save the team from elimination, in 2003 at
least.</TE>
<TE>   Views: The whole business of ticketing the Twins for elimination
was aimed at pressuring the legislature to provide a stadium funding
package. Now that funding is tentatively in place, Selig pushed for a
settlement in the stadium suit because it removes a legal impediment
to finding a local buyer, it saves baseball from having to turn over
thousands of revealing financial and contraction documents and it
eliminates the risk of baseball sustaining its losing streak against
Judge Harry Crump in the suit, in which the commission claims
contraction illegally prevented negotiations on a new lease with the
Twins.</TE>
<TE>   News: Representatives of the owners and players, having spun their
views from coast to coast, return to New York for five bargaining
sessions this month.</TE>
<TE>   Views: Big deal. There is little chance for movement until
arbitrator Shyam Das delivers a decision on the union's contraction
grievance in July or August and/or the union sets a deadline in the
form of a strike date. Das could hand either side a major bargaining
chip in the negotiations, but speculation among people who
participated in the hearings is that he will deliver a split
decision, giving owners the right to eliminate teams without union
approval but ruling that all effects of contraction must be bargained
with the union.</TE>
<TE>   News: Jerry Colangelo, the Arizona Diamondbacks' managing general
partner, holds a second meeting with four of his players to discuss
labor issues.</TE>
<TE>   Views: It's possible that no owner has a closer relationship with
his players. Then again, they've needed one another. Colangelo's core
veterans have deferred more than $60 million in salary to help with
the Diamondbacks' cash flow and debts, enabling management to
maintain the roster that produced a World Series title last year.
Pitcher Brian Anderson, the club's union representative, described
the labor exchanges with Colangelo as "a breath of fresh air" in the
context of owner/player relationships and added, "You just wish we
had another 29 of him, and we'd probably have a deal done."</TE>
<TE>   News: The Oakland Athletics have seven of the first 39 picks in
Tuesday's annual draft of amateur players.</TE>
<TE>   Views: The departures of Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon and Jason
Isringhausen hurt, but each was ranked as a Type A free agent,
meaning the A's got two compensation picks from each of the signing
clubs and a chance to rebuild from within, their small market
hallmark.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very excited about it," General Manager Billy Beane said.
"When you've got that kind of influx in one year, if it works out, it
can have an impact for decades."</TE>
<TE>   Beane will approve all of the choices, but the man on the spot is
first-year scouting director Eric Kubota. In 18 years with the A's,
Kubota has advanced from a media relations assistant to the tough
assignment of succeeding Grady Fuson, whose staff scouted and signed
Big Three pitchers Tim Hudson, Barry Zito and Mark Mulder, among many
other key A's, and whose departure last fall to become assistant GM
of the Texas Rangers led Beane to file a tampering charge that
resulted in the Rangers being fined $550,000.</TE>
<TE>   Part of that was for the hiring of Fuson and part for violations
in the hiring of General Manager John Hart, whose Rangers started the
weekend 12 games behind Seattle in the West and whose free-agent
signings last fall contributed to the fact that the Rangers will not
have a selection in the second through fifth rounds Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Tie Feels Like a Win to Ireland</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The longest week in Ireland Coach Mick McCarthy's life concluded
Saturday with 45 minutes he wished would never end.</LD>
<LD>   After sparring with and sending home his captain, Roy Keane, and
touching off a nationwide controversy that eventually saw Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern intercede and try to mediate, McCarthy finally
got back to the business of soccer with Ireland's World Cup opener
against highly regarded Cameroon in Niigata, Japan.</LD>
<LD>   For 45 minutes, Keane's absence seemed palpable, with Cameroon
controlling play and scoring in the 39th minute, a goal from striker
Patrick Mboma.</LD>
<TE>   But after some harsh words at halftime, McCarthy watched his team
equalize in the 52nd minute, hit the post once, threaten repeatedly
and send the Cameroonians to their locker room grateful to hold on to
a 1-1 draw at Big Swan Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had the hardest week possible," McCarthy said afterward,
"but coming into the game today was a blessed relief. It's nice to be
walking away without being beaten."</TE>
<TE>   In truth, the Irish were unlucky not to have won. After Matt
Holland's skidding strike inside the left post evened the score,
Robbie Keane hit the post, a low-level cross from Gary Breen nearly
produced a Cameroonian own goal and substitute Steven Reid had
Cameroon goalkeeper Boukar Alioum scrambling to palm Reid's late free
kick just over the crossbar.</TE>
<TE>   "Any team would miss a world-class player like Roy Keane," Holland
said, "but we have no choice, and I think we did well. [McCarthy]
told us not to waste two years of hard work in the space of one game.
It worked and we responded."</TE>

<HD>Campos Answers Call for Trojans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC pitcher Cory Campos got an unexpected call at 11:30 p.m. Friday
night. It came from pitching coach Dave Lawn and it was the news that
he has always wanted to hear.</LD>
<LD>   "He told me I was going to start," said the senior pitcher. "I was
so happy that I called my girlfriend and told her."</LD>
<LD>   Campos made his first start of the season count in the NCAA
baseball regional Saturday at USC, pitching 62/3 strong innings in
the Trojans' 7-5 victory over Cal State Northridge.</LD>
<TE>   USC (36-22) needs only one more victory to advance to the
super-regionals for the fourth consecutive year since the format
began in 1999. The Trojans have reached the College World Series the
last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Campos got the start to help neutralize Northridge's army of
left-handed hitters. The Matadors got 11 hits off the 5-foot-7
southpaw but only two of them came from the left-handed power trio of
Shaun Larkin, Eric Verbryke and Tim Arroyo--the heart of the
Northridge lineup.</TE>
<TE>   A starter in high school and for two years at L.A. City College,
Campos (6-2) had made all of his 28 previous appearances this season
out of the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Mike Gillespie thought Campos would keep the big-hitting
Matadors off balance. Northridge led the Big West Conference with 89
home runs.</TE>
<TE>   "Cory had not started for us this year and there was some question
as to how long he could go," Gillespie said. "But in the role Cory's
been in this year, he's been money throwing strikes and does not get
rattled. We trust his stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Verbryke, who played his first game against USC since transferring
from there two years ago, struck out three times against Campos
before hitting an RBI single against him in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   USC took advantage of Bill Murphy's wildness to grab a 4-0 lead in
the third. In his first start since May 10, the Matadors' ace walked
nine and struck out two in four innings. He also hit two batters.</TE>
<TE>   Northridge knocked Campos out in the seventh by scoring two runs
to cut the Trojan lead to 5-4.</TE>
<TE>   USC got two insurance runs in the ninth on a run-scoring double by
Michael Morales and a single by Jon Brewster. Northridge, which had
13 hits but stranded 10 baserunners, threatened again in the bottom
half but could only muster a run-scoring groundout by Arroyo. Jordan
Olson got his second save of the season for the Trojans by getting
the final two outs.</TE>
<TE>   USC will play Brigham Young Monday after the Cougars eliminated
Northridge, 7-2. Rob Itri hit a two-run home run and Matt Carson had
two singles and drove in two runs as BYU won twice Saturday. The
Cougars (31-30-1), who do not play on Sundays for religious reasons,
eliminated Maine, 12-5, earlier in the day.</TE>
<TE>   For the Matadors (41-17), it was a disappointing end to a season
in which they won the Big West Conference in their second year in the
league. The loss to BYU was the final game for seventh-year Coach
Mike Batesole, who took the Fresno State job on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford 5, Long Beach State 4--Tim Cunningham took a no-hitter
into the sixth inning and Dan Rich picked up his third save for the
Cardinal in a winners' bracket game at Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   With the winning run on second in the ninth, Rich got Todd
Jennings to ground out to second for the final out to send Stanford
(42-16) to today's regional championship game against Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Fullerton 9, San Jose State 1--David Fischer homered and
drove in two runs and Jordan DeJong pitched a six-hitter as the
Titans won at Stanford to eliminate San Jose State (45-17).</TE>
<TE>   DeJong (11-3) shut down the Spartans and Shane Costa scored twice
and had two hits for the fourth-seeded Titans.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach (39-20) eliminated Fullerton in the night's last game
with Jered Weaver and Chris Demaria combining on a four-hitter in a
4-0 victory. The Titans end 37-22.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame 25, South Alabama 1--At the South Bend regional,
freshman Grant Johnson threw a one-hitter and Steve Sollmann went six
for seven with seven RBIs and set an NCAA tournament record with six
runs scored in the Irish's rout of top-seeded South Alabama.</TE>

<LD>Two goals by Jon Dahl Tomasson earned Denmark a 2-1 victory over
Uruguay in Ulsan, South Korea, Saturday and left the South Americans
on the brink of elimination from the World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Victor Pua's team, which looked dangerous at times but not
consistently so, now must defeat world champion France in Busan on
Thursday, or at least earn a tie, to stay alive in the 32-nation
tournament.</LD>
<LD>   If Uruguay does win, it will almost surely spell the end for
France, which already has lost to Senegal in Group A play.</LD>
<TE>   Further complicating matters for the French is that Coach Roger
Lemerre said it would be "astonishing" if playmaker Zinedine Zidane
could recover from a thigh injury in time to play in Thursday's
match.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's game was entertaining and well handled by referee Saad
Mane of Kuwait in front of a crowd of 30,157.</TE>
<TE>   The Danes took the lead in the final minute of the first half
after an excellent passing exchange left Tomasson free to side-foot
the ball powerfully past goalkeeper Fabian Carini from close range.</TE>
<TE>   Uruguay tied it two minutes into the second half on a superb
left-foot volley from 20 yards by Dario Rodriguez, but Tomasson got
behind the South Americans' defense again with seven minutes to play
and headed in the winner off the underside of the crossbar.</TE>
<TE>   "The first game is always a nervous affair and it's
psychologically difficult," Denmark Coach Morten Olsen said. "I
thought that after the first 25 minutes we controlled the game
physically, tactically and technically."</TE>

<LD>   Series: Monday, 6 p.m.; Tuesday, 6 p.m.; Wednesday, noon.</LD>
<LD>   Site: Coors Field, Denver.</LD>
<TE>   Matchup: Whether it's the humidor the Rockies have been storing
game balls in or simply better pitch execution, Colorado entered
Thursday with a 4.24 team earned-run average, a marked improvement
for a team that has finished last in the NL in ERA eight times and
next to last once in nine previous seasons. The Rockies, who won
eight of 10 games recently to move above the .500 mark, have finished
with a sub-5.00 ERA only twice, when they won the NL wild card in
1995 (4.85) and in 1998 (4.99). Surprisingly, the so-called ace of
the staff, Mike Hampton, has not led the way. The left-hander dropped
to 2-6 with a 6.54 ERA after an 8-5 loss to San Diego on Monday.
"It's to a point that what's happening is embarrassing," Hampton
said.</TE>

<TE>   Opponent: Baltimore Orioles</TE>
<TE>   Series: Friday, 4 p.m.; Saturday, 4 p.m.; Sunday, 10:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Site: Camden Yards, Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Matchup: The interleague portion of the Dodger schedule begins
with a series against the Orioles, who feature a young catcher named
Geronimo Gil, a name that may not be familiar to Dodger fans but is
to the Dodger front office. Last July, the Dodgers traded Gil and
another minor leaguer to Baltimore for reliever Mike Trombley, who
was a bust in Los Angeles and released this spring. Gil has developed
into a solid big league catcher, hitting .271 with seven homers and
24 RBIs entering the weekend. The Baltimore offense also features
Jeff Conine (.254, eight homers, 37 RBIs) and Tony Batista (.259, 12
homers, 32 RBIs). Oriole pitcher Sidney Ponson was believed to be
untouchable last year, but the Orioles have entertained trade offers
for the young right-hander.</TE>

<HD>Grissom Getting Best of Johnson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marquis Grissom is at a loss to explain his recent hot hitting
against the most feared left-hander in the major leagues, Arizona's
Randy Johnson.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know. I'm just a different hitter on those days, I
guess," said Grissom, who in his last two games against the Big Unit
is three for five with three home runs and six runs batted in.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm sticking to my strength and that's just baseball," added
Grissom, who hit a three-run home run off Johnson Friday night. "You
hit some guys well, some guys you don't. Some days you see the ball
better than others. Players change every day.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm just finding myself, finding some inner peace with myself."</TE>
<TE>   Before his recent surge, Grissom was just trying to find a hit
against Johnson, a spring training teammate with the Montreal Expos
in the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Grissom had been one for 25 with 15 strikeouts against Johnson in
his career.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why you throw the book out the window," Grissom said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know [Johnson] is one of the best so I'm not going to go out
there and try to be as aggressive as he is because he's already
supplying the power. So I'm just trying to relax a little bit, see
the ball, hit the ball. But there really [is] no reason [for the
recent success against Johnson]. I just say it's baseball."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If the Dodgers could rewrite history, think they would have
offered Johnson $105 million and a private jet in the winter of 1998?</TE>
<TE>   Since then Johnson has gone 66-23, won three consecutive Cy Young
awards and been named a World Series co-most valuable player, all
without spending a day on the disabled list after signing with the
Diamondbacks on Dec. 10, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Brown, who signed with the Dodgers for the aforementioned
terms two days later--after Johnson spurned their $50 million-plus
offer--has gone 43-22 and been on the disabled list six times, twice
already this season.</TE>

<HD>Another Young Titan Is Deflated by Agassi</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>How many times has Andre Agassi just shredded the confidence of a hot
young player?</LD>
<LD>   It had happened twice already this year. In San Jose, Andy Roddick
won four games against Agassi in the semifinals. In Rome, Tommy Haas
took six games off Agassi in the Italian Open final ... over three
sets.</LD>
<LD>   No. 3 came Saturday at the French Open in a match between the
oldest and youngest players remaining in the draw.</LD>
<TE>   Spaniard Tommy Robredo, who turned 20 on May 1, is 12 years
younger than Agassi, and arrived in Paris with respectable clay-court
credentials, having reached the semifinals in the Masters Series
event at Hamburg, Germany, beating Sebastien Grosjean and Haas. He
finally lost to Marat Safin, retiring in the second set because of an
ankle injury.</TE>
<TE>   All this meant very little to the fourth-seeded Agassi, who
dispatched Robredo with stunning ease, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2, in 94 minutes
in the third round.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi has learned not to let up when the finish line is in his
view.</TE>
<TE>   "When someone gets the worst end of something like that, you never
know what Plan Bs these players have," he said of Robredo. "He has a
lot of firepower. I know if he was really tired of running, he could
just start playing bigger. The last thing you want to do is lay off
any of your shots and give him a look and let him get some confidence
going."</TE>
<TE>   Robredo sounded a lot like the kids who used to suffer through
rough initiations against the likes of Jimmy Connors.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a chance in the second set to catch up in the game,"
Robredo said. "Perhaps things could have changed. You could see that
this was going to be an interesting match. But his game was good
throughout, and I want to congratulate him and to learn from him, to
learn from all the great players."</TE>
<TE>   Next for Agassi is his second French opponent of the tournament,
wild-card Paul-Henri Mathieu. Since winning here in 1999, Agassi lost
in the second round in 2000 and in last year's quarterfinals to
Grosjean.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to believe I'm a strong contender," Agassi said. "I want
to believe that coming here.... But every time I've won, it's always
come with a different story. It's always come with a different
feeling, with a different preparation. I've gone into Slams feeling
great, and [won]. I've gone into Slams feeling great, and not [won].
I've gone into Slams feeling like I have no chance, and it just
somehow comes together."</TE>
<TE>   Agassi is the only remaining American male after three rounds.
Vince Spadea lost in four sets to Grosjean, who was buoyed by fervent
crowd support on Court Suzanne Lenglen. Grosjean, who will play
Belgian Xavier Malisse in the fourth round, beat Spadea, 6-2, 7-6
(5), 6-7 (5), 6-4, in 3 hours 22 minutes, a ragged affair featuring
15 service breaks.</TE>
<TE>   It's vastly different on the women's side, with four Americans in
the final 16: No. 1-seeded and defending champion Jennifer Capriati,
No. 2 Venus Williams, No. 3 Serena Williams and Chanda Rubin.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the three of us right now are at the top of our game,"
Serena Williams, who beat Janette Husarova of Slovakia, 6-1, 6-3,
said of the top three. "I think we'll be switching around, all three
of us. I could see it because we're all doing so well. It's great
that the top three are all Americans."</TE>
<TE>   Serena Williams will play 17-year-old Russian qualifier Vera
Zvonareva today in the fourth round. Zvonareva survived a
near-meltdown against Francesca Schiavone of Italy, blowing seven
match points in the second set before reviving to win, 6-2, 6-7 (4),
7-5, in 2 hours 56 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Much shorter was Capriati's 53-minute, 6-3, 6-1 defeat of
Australian Evie Dominikovic, who won only one game after holding a
break point for a 4-1 first-set lead.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Chung scored the second of his two goals in the 76th minute to
lead the Colorado Rapids to a 3-2 victory over the Galaxy on Saturday
in front of 8,249 at Denver.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously this loss is a big disappointment for us. We had hoped
to get at least nine points on this road trip," said Galaxy assistant
coach Ralph Perez as the team earned only six of a possible 15 points
in the five games and has lost three in a row. "Now we have to focus
hard on making improvements in a week of training before we take on
the Chicago Fire."</LD>
<LD>   Colorado goalkeeper Scott Garlick stopped six shots and preserved
the Rapids' fourth victory in their last five games with a sprawling
save on a shot by Sasha Victorine in the waning minutes.</LD>
<TE>   Carlos Ruiz scored two goals for the Galaxy (4-4-2) to improve his
Major League Soccer-leading mark to 10. Ruiz's second goal in the
65th minute had given the Galaxy a 2-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz put a shot under Garlick's right arm in the 32nd minute to
put the Galaxy ahead 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Valderrama tied the game for the Rapids (6-3-1) in the 67th
minute, scoring his first goal in two years.</TE>
<TE>   In other MLS games:</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 2, New England 0-- Ariel Graziani scored two goals
against his former team as the Earthquakes (6-3-2) defeated the
Revolution (3-5-1) in front of 21,539 at Foxboro, Mass. Richard
Mulrooney assisted on both goals.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 2, Kansas City 2--Dario Fabbro of Argentina scored his
first two MLS goals for the Wizards (2-3-4) as they tied the Burn
(3-2-5) in front of 7,266 at Kansas City, Mo. Jason Kreis and
Joselito Vaca scored for Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Women's United Soccer Assn. games:</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 2, San Diego 0--Homare Sawa scored her first goal of the
season and had an assist to lead the Beat (4-3-1) over the Spirit
(2-4-2) in front of 5,815 at San Diego. It was goalkeeper Brianna
Scurry league-leading third shutout of the season.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 0, Philadelphia 0--CyberRay goalkeeper LaKeysia Beene
punched away a free kick by the Charge's Jenny Benson during
second-half stoppage time to preserve the tie in front of 5,903 at
Villanova, Pa. San Jose is 3-3-2 and Philadelphia is 5-1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 4, New York 1--Unni Lehn and Birgit Prinz scored their

<HD>Germany Wins a Blowout</HD>
<DH>Group E: Klose scores three goals in 8-0 victory over Saudi
Arabia, the largest margin in World Cup since 1982.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Judging from the first round of results in Group E on Saturday, one
prediction can safely be made:</LD>
<LD>   Saudi Arabia won't be advancing to the second round.</LD>
<LD>   After Cameroon and Ireland waged a hard-fought draw, Germany
routed the Saudis, 8-0, at Sapporo, Japan, in the fourth most
lopsided score in World Cup history.</LD>
<TE>   The Germans scored four goals in each half and five on
headers--three by Miroslav Klose. Also scoring for Germany were
Michael Ballack, Cartsen Jancker, Thomas Linke, Oliver Bierhoff and
Brend Schneider.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a fantastic start," Germany Coach Rudi Voller said. "But we
have to keep our feet on the ground because we know our opponent
wasn't that strong today."</TE>
<TE>   The eight-goal margin of defeat was the World Cup's largest since
Hungary beat El Salvador, 10-1, in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a disastrous result," said shell-shocked Saudi Coach
Nasser Al-Johar. "Our team performed badly. There was a definite
collapse in the game. This is not our real team."</TE>
<TE>   Al-Johar apologized to the team's supporters for the performance,
saying, "I am also responsible.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't expect this from my players. I'm very disappointed. Some
players did not play very well at all, but we have two more matches
to play and we can still qualify. We promise our fans in Saudi Arabia
and the Arab world to do our best in the next two matches."</TE>

<HD>Nothing Else to Say for Mexico</HD>
<DH>Group G: In opener, players face Croatia, which was
strongly criticized by Aguirre before World Cup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NIIGATA, Japan</DL>
<LD>How many tough acts are too many to follow?</LD>
<LD>   The Croatian "golden generation" of soccer talent that produced
the surprising third-place finish in the 1998 World Cup has
accumulated some tarnish, with such luminaries as Davor Suker, Alen
Boksic, Robert Jarni and Robert Prosinecki all 32 or older. Monday,
(tonight, Pacific time), the old Croats try to limber up for the
opening act of their encore.</LD>
<LD>   Mexico Coach Javier Aguirre, who has spent the last week reminding
anyone who would listen that Croatia isn't what it used to be, now
faces the hard part, the walk-had-better-be-as-good-as-the-talk part.</LD>
<TE>   Mexico and Croatia face the unenviable assignment of stepping onto
the field at Big Swan Stadium, where two days earlier Ireland and
Cameroon engaged in a thrilling first-round match, displaying the
kind of passion, nerve and suspense usually reserved for a final.</TE>
<TE>   Unlikely to scale those kinds of heights, Mexico and Croatia enter
their match just trying to get their accounts in order. Croatia has
more doubters than Aguirre to convince--and an encounter with Italy
next on the schedule. Mexico has not played a consistently effective
90 minutes in months, partly because of Aguirre's lineup
experimentation, partly because of Mexico's dearth of creative
talent.</TE>
<TE>   With his best playmaker, Jesus Arellano, and attacking midfielder
Joahan Rodriquez suspended, Aguirre has patched together a midfield
with spare parts while doing what he could to rattle and distract the
Croatians.</TE>
<TE>   Defense-minded as a coach, Aguirre went firmly on the attack in
recent days, describing Croatia as past its prime, suspect in the
back and basically there for the taking.</TE>
<TE>   "It does not look like a really strong team," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This seemed to cause more confusion than anger in the Croatia
camp, where coaches and players rightly wondered what Aguirre was
getting at.</TE>
<TE>   When was the last time Mexico has been to the World Cup
semifinals? (Answer: Never.)</TE>
<TE>   What has Mexico done lately to set the soccer world afire?
(Answer: Nothing. Mexico barely qualified for this World Cup, having
to rally from a 1-3-2 start to clinch on the very last day. Since,
Mexico has looked unimpressive in a string of exhibition victories
against national "B" teams and club sides at less than full
strength.)</TE>
<TE>   Croatia Coach Mirko Jozic acknowledged his team might not be the
equal of its 1998 predecessor, but noted that Mexico has seen better
days as well.</TE>
<TE>   "The last Mexican generation was also more talented and now they
are a lot older," he said. "Some have even retired from international
soccer."</TE>
<TE>   And for all the talk about Croatia's over-30 brigade, Aguirre
appears ready to start one of the oldest players on his roster,
33-year-old Sigifredo Mercado, at right defensive midfielder tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Jarni may be 33, but he is still a dangerous threat on Croatia's
left wing. Aguirre believes he needs an experienced hand to blunt
Jarni and his attacking runs down the flank.</TE>
<TE>   Suker, who led all scorers at the '98 World Cup, is 34, and his
longtime partner on Croatia's forward line, Boksic, is 32. Playmaking
midfielder Prosinecki, the key to the Croatian attack, is also 32.
Yet Aguirre is concerned enough about the challenge they present to
juggle his back line, bringing in Salvador Carmona, a veteran of
Mexico's 1998 World Cup team, to start at left back ahead of the
lesser experienced Melvin Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Braulio Luna, a pleasant surprise in recent games, and Gabriel
Caballero, recently naturalized from his native Argentina, will start
at the left and right attacking midfield positions.</TE>
<TE>   Up front, Aguirre is expected to partner his best goal scorer,
Cuauhtemoc Blanco, with Jared Borgetti--possibly using speedy
Francisco Palencia as a change-of-pace substitute.</TE>
<TE>   With Italy the prohibitive favorite to win the group and Ecuador
making its World Cup debut, the winner of this match will have an
inside track on second place and the other berth in the second round.
Here, the talk stops. And with it, most likely the loser as well.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BATON ROUGE, La.</DL>
<LD>Angela Williams was chasing history.</LD>
<LD>   Her newest USC teammate was chasing her.</LD>
<LD>   Williams finished with a fantastic flourish, beating out
fast-closing Natasha Mayers on Saturday to become the first person to
win four consecutive NCAA titles in the 100 meters.</LD>
<TE>   She did it by the slimmest margin, leaning to cross the line in
11.29 seconds, 0.01 ahead of Mayers.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh man, I can't believe it," said Williams, overtaken with
emotion and relief as the cameras closed in and she raised her arms
to the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so glad it's over. I think that's what I was jumping up and
down so much about. It's over.</TE>
<TE>   "Such a big load has been taken off me. That was by a hair. I had
to lean. I've never had to lean before."</TE>
<TE>   Williams left victorious--and so did Mayers, who took second in
the 100 and first in the 200 in 22.93 in a dramatic NCAA debut.</TE>
<TE>   The defending champion Trojans settled for third in the NCAA track
and field championships at Louisiana State's Bernie Moore Stadium,
behind South Carolina and UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   The top-ranked Bruins were overtaken by the Gamecocks after South
Carolina finished 2-3-4 in the 400 meters, then clinched convincingly
in the 1,600 relay with a collegiate record time of 3:26.46.</TE>
<TE>   Lashinda Demus, a freshman from Long Beach Wilson High, led the
way to the Gamecocks' first team championship in any sport, setting a
world junior record in the 400 hurdles Friday, then finishing third
in the 400 and running the anchor leg for the record-setting relay
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA finished 10 points behind South Carolina's 82 despite an
NCAA-record tying five individual championships.</TE>
<TE>   Lena Nilsson added the 1,500 to the Bruins' cache Saturday and
Jessica Cosby won the shotput, making UCLA the first school to win
four field events. (The Bruins earlier won the pole vault, high jump
and discus.)</TE>
<TE>   USC, third with 57 points, couldn't mount a challenge after
falling short of expectations in the throwing events.</TE>
<TE>   The men's competition was won by host LSU, which clinched with a
third in the final relay to finish with 64 points, seven ahead of
Tennessee, whose Justin Gatlin became the first man in 45 years to
repeat as 100 and 200 champion.</TE>
<TE>   The USC men were 11th and UCLA was 30th.</TE>
<TE>   There were many champions, but the day belonged to Williams.</TE>
<TE>   The woman who tried to block Williams' path to history was Mayers,
a 2000 Olympian for St. Vincent and the Grenadines who transferred to
USC from L.A. Southwest College in the spring and became eligible
only May 17.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that if she got in, she would be a threat to my title,"
Williams said. "It was kind of hard to stay serious and know that
your main competitor is sitting in the back seat."</TE>
<TE>   Mayers was practically in her back pocket in the final 30 meters,
as the fastest closer bore down on the champion who is so explosive
out of the blocks.</TE>
<TE>   "I ran with everything I had," said Mayers, who collapsed after
the race. "I never had a doubt in my heart I could have won the race,
but ... another day."</TE>
<TE>   The only other women to win four championships in one event were
Suzy Favor of Wisconsin in the 1,500 in 1987-90 and Seilala Sua of
UCLA in the discus from 1997-2000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two months after Minnesota's golf program was targeted for
elimination, the Golden Gophers won their first national title.</TE>
<TE>   The Gophers, reprieved when boosters raised enough money to
reinstate the program for at least a year, shot a six-under-par 278
for a 1,134 total and a four-stroke victory over top-ranked Georgia
Tech at Upper Arlington, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Tech's Troy Matteson won the individual title, shooting a
four-under 67 to finish at eight-under 276.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The old man still has some fight left in him.</LD>
<LD>   Evander Holyfield, showing glimpses of the warrior he was in his
prime, pounded Hasim Rahman for most of eight rounds Saturday night
at Atlantic City, N.J., before winning a technical decision after a
head butt caused a large swelling on Rahman's head.</LD>
<LD>   "Don't tell me what God can't do," said Holyfield, a four-time
heavyweight champion. "Don't tell me he can't revive a 39-year-old."</LD>
<TE>   The head butt in the seventh round followed one in the fourth. The
swelling kept getting bigger until it had grown grotesquely to nearly
the size of a baseball on the top left side of Rahman's forehead.</TE>
<TE>   After the fight was halted in the middle of the eighth round, ring
doctor Dominic Coletta consulted with the referee and stopped the
bout, leaving it up to the judges.</TE>
<TE>   Two judges had Holyfield leading, 69-64, and the third had Rahman
ahead, 67-66.</TE>
<TE>   "We did hit heads there, but I'm hitting him with shots anyway and
I hit him right on it," Holyfield (38-5-2) said.</TE>
<TE>   Rahman, 29, a former heavyweight champion, was dazed and confused
for several minutes after the fight, while he got medical attention
on his stool.</TE>
<TE>   "He was head-butting me from Round 1 and I told the referee,"
Rahman (35-4) said. "I don't feel Evander beat me. I don't think it
was a fair or an official fight."</TE>

February 2001 trade that sent All-Star defenseman Rob Blake to
Colorado, was a second-round pick by the Avalanche in the 2000 draft.
If he hadn't been signed by the Kings before 2 p.m. Saturday, he
would have gone back into the draft pool.</TE>

<HD>Glavine, Sheffield Deliver for Braves</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tom Glavine has always felt comfortable at Cincinnati's Cinergy
Field, even when it was called Riverfront Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   After sitting out several games because of a pulled left
hamstring, Gary Sheffield is starting to feel comfortable in the
batter's box--even Cincinnati's, where he has never felt at home.</LD>
<LD>   Sheffield drove in five runs with two homers and Glavine improved
to 16-4 in his career at Cincinnati, and Atlanta routed the Reds,
7-1, Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Glavine, who has the most victories by a opposing pitcher at
Cinergy Field, gave up one run and five hits in seven innings. It was
his 233rd career victory.</TE>
<TE>   "As much as everyone else is looking for the new stadium [Great
American Ball Park], I'll be one who's sad to see it go," Glavine
said. "I don't know why, but I feel comfortable here. I like the
mound. I like the backdrop. Hopefully, I'll be able to take it across
the street."</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta hit three home runs against Jose Rijo (4-3), who was
making his first start since May 23 after sitting out a turn because
of fatigue and discomfort in his shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   After Chipper Jones singled to start the second, Andruw Jones
followed with his 13th home run. Sheffield hit a two-run homer in the
third. It was his seventh home run and first since May 16.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been taking a lot of hitting, and I've shortened my stride,"
said Sheffield, who had a career .235 batting average at Cincinnati.
"When I hit a ball out on a line, I feel like I'm at my best. My
attitude is I'm capable of two RBIs a game."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 5, San Francisco 4--Mike Hampton (3-6) earned a rare road
victory and improved to 12-1 in 20 career starts against the Giants.
The left-hander had been 0-5 with a 9.21 earned-run average away from
Coors Field this season.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Helton had four hits and drove in two runs, helping the
Rockies win their third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 8, Montreal 4--Scott Rolen had two home runs and five
RBIs--matching his run-production total for May--to lead the Phillies
at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Rolen, batting second for the first time in his major league
career, ended a 2-2 tie with a three-run homer in the seventh. Bobby
Abreu followed with a solo drive to make it 6-2. Rolen's two-run
homer in the sixth tied the score, 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 9, New York 7--The Mets lost their cool and the Marlins
won a slugfest sparked by Preston Wilson's two homers, giving the
largest crowd this season at Miami plenty of chances to cheer and
jeer.</TE>
<TE>   A crowd of 33,291 hollered as Met catcher Mike Piazza and Manager
Bobby Valentine were ejected in the bottom of the seventh inning for
arguing about Piazza's called third strike in the top half of the
inning. They were ejected just before Mike Lowell's solo homer put
the Marlins ahead, 7-6.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 9, Pittsburgh 4--Edgar Renteria hit a three-run double
and the Cardinals staked Darryl Kile to a six-run lead in the first
inning at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Kile (3-3), who had received a team-low average of 3.2 runs of
support, gave up six hits, struck out two and walked two in seven
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 4, San Diego 3--Mark Loretta's one-out suicide squeeze
against Padre closer Trevor Hoffman in the top of the ninth inning
scored Ronnie Belliard at San Diego.</TE>

<HD>Prior's Third Start Gets Wind-Swept</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Mark Prior learned how tough Wrigley Field can be to a pitcher when
the wind is blowing out.</LD>
<LD>   The Houston Astros handed Prior his first major league loss,
roughing up the heralded rookie for three early home runs and
defeating the Chicago Cubs, 7-3, Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   With the wind gusting up to 22 mph, Prior was tagged for seven
runs, seven hits and gave up three home runs in 32/3 innings.</LD>
<TE>   "He knows you have to keep the ball down when the wind is blowing
out and I think he learned that lesson," Cub Manager Don Baylor said.</TE>
<TE>   But Prior, drafted by the Cubs out of USC last year, believes that
adjusting to the wind isn't necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't pitch whether the wind is blowing in or out. You got to
go out there and throw your game," Prior said.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs, who have lost five of their last seven, held a private
meeting before the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't really give any detail," Sammy Sosa said. "That stays
between us."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Hidalgo, Lance Berkman and Geoff Blum homered against
Prior in his third start.</TE>
<TE>   Prior, who had been three for seven with two homers at triple-A
Iowa, had a two-run double.</TE>
<TE>   But Prior was chased in the Astros' five-run fourth. He struck out
five and walked two.</TE>
<TE>   Cub pitching coach Larry Rothschild was ejected in the second
inning by plate umpire Jeff Nelson after arguing balls and strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Oswalt (6-3) pitched 72/3 innings, giving up three runs and
eight hits. He retired 11 batters in a row before Fred McGriff hit a
one-out single in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Oswalt was lifted in the eighth after giving up a run-scoring
single to Roosevelt Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt good," Oswalt said. "The last inning I was just getting
the ball up."</TE>

<DL>KYOTO, Japan</DL>
<LD>Stung by the judging scandal that engulfed the pairs figure skating
competition at the Salt Lake City Olympics, the International Skating
Union is expected to adopt sweeping reforms of the sport's scoring
and judging systems this week during its Congress.</LD>
<LD>   An ISU proposal outlined during the Winter Games by its president,
Ottavio Cinquanta, would eliminate the traditional 6.0 perfect score
in favor of a cumulative score based on the difficulty of elements
performed. The judges' panel would expand to 14 and a computer would
randomly select seven scores to count toward the final tally, a
change designed to eliminate bloc judging and deal-making.</LD>
<LD>   Such radical ideas are evidence the ISU "recognizes the urgent
need for changes to the existing system for selection of judges and
the determination of results," it said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   Canada, the U.S. and Australia have also submitted "urgent
proposals." Such initiatives need a four-fifths majority vote to be
placed on the Congress' agenda. To become part of the ISU
Regulations, any proposal would need to be approved by a two-thirds
majority of members attending.</TE>
<TE>   The meetings, which will include elections for president, council
members and technical committees, begin Monday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Although usually resistant to change, the ISU is expected to adopt
at least some reforms in response to the backlash generated by the
discovery of improprieties in the judging of the Olympic pairs event
and past improprieties among ice dance judges.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's imperative on a number of levels that changes come
out of this," said Dick Pound, an influential member of the
International Olympic Committee.</TE>
<TE>   IOC President Jacques Rogge, who was angered by the Salt Lake City
brouhaha, also wants an overhaul of the judging system. Rogge
reaffirmed the autonomy of international federations in implementing
the rules of their sports but said the IOC "calls for better rules
and calls for a situation that would lead to far less controversy."</TE>
<TE>   French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne's claim she was pressured to
vote a certain way by French ice sports federation head Didier
Gailhaguet drew a spotlight to the deals and vote-swapping that have
long undermined skating's credibility. Le Gougne retracted her
accusation, but the ISU suspended her and Gailhaguet for three years
and banned them from the 2006 Olympics. Gailhaguet, however, was
reelected president of the French ice sports federation last week.</TE>
<TE>   Because the ISU determined Le Gougne acted improperly during the
Games, the IOC awarded duplicate gold medals to Canadians Jamie Sale
and David Pelletier, who were second to Russians Elena Berezhnaya and
Anton Sikharulidze.</TE>
<TE>   The world championships were also marred by controversy. About 20
ice dance couples signed a petition protesting the fourth-place
finish of Lithuanians Margarita Drobiazko and Povilas Vanagas amid
allegations the father of Israeli ice dancer Galit Chait had
threatened a coach and skaters. Chait and Sergei Sakhnovsky won the
bronze. The ISU rejected an appeal by the Lithuanians.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran coach John Nicks is skeptical the proposed changes will
make much difference.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me it's not the rules and regulations that need to
change, it's the sureness and character of the judges involved," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ensuring panels are geographically balanced and judges are held
accountable for their decisions is crucial to restoring credibility,
said Paul Wylie, the 1992 men's Olympic silver medalist and member of
a group that helped shape part of the reform proposal backed by the
U.S. Figure Skating Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "The sport relies on the credibility of the judging system, and I
think people look at the judging system and need to believe it's for
real," he said. "When bias rules, it costs skaters, the stakeholders,
a great deal."</TE>
<TE>   Wylie dislikes the ISU's idea of scoring from 0 up instead of from
6.0 down. The ISU proposes setting up a Scale of Value for each
element and requiring skaters to submit a plan of their programs, by
element and by time. Skaters would get points for each element. Each
skater or pair would also get a Grade of Execution, to be added to
the Scale of Value points to form the technical score.</TE>
<TE>   Each judge would also assign a presentation score, ranging from
0.1 to 6.0, based on basic skills and performance skills. That mark
would be multiplied by a special factor to produce a presentation
score, which would be added to the technical score.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think additive scoring works," Wylie said. "... There's
41/2 minutes of figure skating to watch. You can't sit and add in
your head and also get a feel for presentation."</TE>
<TE>   The USFSA's proposal would keep the 6.0 but would eliminate
ordinals--each judge's ranking of each skater--in favor of a median
total score. It would also have a computer randomly select which
judges' marks would count.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had people in our organization and statisticians say it was
a very solid way to go about things," said USFSA President Phyllis
Howard, who leads the five-person U.S. delegation. "The median mark
is a way to protect against judging blocs."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. also proposes to ban for life any judge or federation
official found guilty of unethical conduct. The ISU calls for
two-year suspensions "in the case of a judge being responsible for
evident and/or repeated anomalies." An Australian proposal suggests a
country whose judge is found guilty of misconduct in two consecutive
seasons or three nonconsecutive seasons should lose its right to
nominate a judge for events such as the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is an urgent need for reform," said Howard, who is
running for one of five figure skating spots on the 11-member ISU
Council. "It's critical to address that at this time."</TE>

Reformation Project
Key points of the figure skating judging reforms proposed for
discussion at the International Skating Union Congress, Monday
through Friday, at Kyoto, Japan:
ISU PROPOSAL
* Fourteen judges will grade skaters but a computer would randomly
select seven anonymous votes to make up final scores
* Cumulative point values would be awarded for technical elements and
added to a presentation mark to produce total score
* Marks of all judges and referees would be sealed until the end of
the season, when they would be analyzed by computer for anomalies
* Judges will have touch-screen computers and video replays. They
would be compensated for their work at the end of the season
U.S. PROPOSAL
* Placements of skaters would be determined by a median mark. A
computer would select seven of 10 judges' scores (or five of eight on
smaller panels) to calculate score
* Judges' panels would be geographically balanced. An ISU committee
would determine the appropriate distribution among regions and number
per region
* Lifetime bans for advisors, judges, referees, federation officials
or members of an ISU federation found guilty of misconduct or an
ethical violation
AUSTRALIAN PROPOSAL
* Events would be judged by two groups of seven judges on opposite
sides of the rink. The scores of nine randomly selected judges will
count toward the results
* The two highest and two lowest scores would be dropped. The
remaining five would be counted by the computer to determine the
results
* Referees must be of a different nationality than the medal winners
of the year before in the event in which they officiate
CANADIAN PROPOSAL
* Supports ISU proposal but suggests two years' testing and
evaluating before permanent adoption. Until then, judges' panels
would consist of 14 members, randomly drawn. Nine judges' marks and
ordinals will be used to calculate the final result
* Lifetime ban for those found guilty of misconduct
* Presidents of national federations could not serve as judges or
referees</TE>

<HD>A Stinging Rebuke for Sparks' Goal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>When they dueled for the WNBA championship last season, the Sparks
had a clear edge over the Charlotte Sting in talent, size and desire.</LD>
<LD>   This season the Sparks may still have an edge in the first two
categories. But on Saturday the Sting had a greater desire to win,
and pulled off a 94-87 overtime victory before 10,063 at Charlotte
Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   The Sting, playing its season opener, scored the first five points
of overtime and, as was the case most of the game, made the Sparks
(3-1) do the chasing.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles--whose coach, Michael Cooper, had set an unbeaten
season as a goal for his team--got as close as 88-86 with 2:12 to
play, but the Sting outscored the visitors, 6-1, down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   It was a somewhat painful win for Charlotte, which lost its best
player, Andrea Stinson, in the first half because of a sprained left
ankle. But not even the loss of Stinson or Spark center Lisa Leslie's
26 points and 12 rebounds could deter the Sting on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The loss ended the Sparks' nine-game winning streak against the
Sting, which included L.A.'s two-game sweep in the WNBA Finals last
September. That was certainly on the mind of Charlotte Coach Anne
Donovan, especially when the Sting raised its Eastern Conference
championship banner before the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly didn't forget how the season ended in Los Angeles,"
Donovan said. "Raising our banner reminded us of that. And we also
didn't want to start the season like we did last year [1-10]. We
wanted to get off to a strong start."</TE>
<TE>   The Sting--which had not played since an exhibition game on May
20--figures to stay strong if it keeps getting the kind of scoring
distribution it had Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Five players were in double figures, led by Kelly Miller, who came
off the bench to replace the injured Stinson and scored a career-high
23 points. Dawn Staley (10 for 12 at the free-throw line) scored 19
and reserve center Tammy Sutton Brown had 17.</TE>
<TE>   The Sting hadn't beaten the Sparks since a 77-73 win in Los
Angeles on June 24, 1998. Charlotte's last home victory against the
Sparks was July 21, 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie, who fouled out for the second consecutive game, was
supported by Latasha Byears, who had 15 and eight rebounds before
also fouling out, and Mwadi Mabika, who had 13 points.</TE>
<TE>   The loss also ended the Sparks' "quest" for an undefeated regular
season, but Cooper didn't seem too upset.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll say this first--32-0 is not going to happen. That's fine, it
was a goal but that's over with," Cooper said. "Our ultimate goal is
still the championship. This game shows us how much more work we have
to do."</TE>
<TE>   The Sting shot 51.7% from the field and 57.1% (12 for 21) from
three-point range. It also outrebounded the Sparks, 34-31.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks--who trailed, 42-39, at halftime--kept after the Sting
until they caught up at 59-59 with 11:51 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Then the intensity level rose on both sides. There were seven ties
and six lead changes in the final nine minutes of regulation. And the
Sting's chance to win the game on the last play was thwarted when
Nikki Teasley blocked Staley's shot with five seconds to go.</TE>
<TE>   But the Sparks, finishing a weeklong road trip, didn't run out of
gas or interest. Charlotte just didn't run out of desire.</TE>
<TE>   "If we have to lose I'll take it," Leslie said. "I felt it would
take a perfect game to beat us and Charlotte played one."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other WNBA games:</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Tamika Catchings had 23 points and 13 rebounds as Indiana
opened its season with a 79-62 victory over Detroit before 13,014 at
Indianapolis.... Stacey Dales-Schuman, who led Oklahoma to the NCAA
title game this year, scored 23 points as Washington beat visiting
Orlando, 93-82, before 17,383.... Tina Thompson scored 26 points and
sparked a comeback in Houston's 69-65 overtime win at Cleveland
before 12,773.... Tracy Reid scored 16 points as Phoenix defeated
Utah, 71-66, before 9,647 in Phoenix.... Katie Smith scored 17 of her
23 points in the second half as Minnesota rallied for a 63-61 victory
at Sacramento before 17,317.</TE>

<LD>What will it take for the United States to produce a World Cup team
with speed and power and skill in every position, a team capable of
upsetting a world champion--in short, a team like Senegal?</LD>
<LD>   "They're terrific athletes," defender Jeff Agoos said Saturday.
"We have that level of athletes in the U.S. We have some of those
guys on our team.</LD>
<LD>   "Our best athletes, some play soccer, some play football, some
play basketball, hockey, whatever. We're a much more diverse country
than a lot of the countries we play against."</LD>
<TE>   The challenge, Agoos said, was in luring more top athletes away
from other sports to soccer, but that will take some doing.</TE>
<TE>   "[It takes] a strong domestic league, higher salaries, more
organization, more development at the youth level, better recognition
of talented players." he said. "There are quite a number of things."</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeeper Brad Friedel suggested one more.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to get someone who loves to play soccer," Friedel said.
"You can't just take somebody who is 6 feet 4 and big and fast and
say, 'Right, come play soccer now.' They have to love the game,
because if they don't, they might as well not play it.</TE>
<TE>   "In America, it's hard. When you're growing up, you want to play
other sports."</TE>

<TE>   The U.S. opens its World Cup against Portugal on Wednesday and the
Portuguese will be without experienced defender Abel Xavier, who
injured his left hamstring in training and will be sidelined up to 10
days.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. striker Clint Mathis  said that Xavier's absence will not
make the task confronting the U.S. any easier.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's to say?" he said. "Any player can play their greatest game
on any given day or against any given team, so I don't think that
[Xavier's injury] is going to change the mind-set of what we're going
to do or change the structure of the Portuguese team. They're still a
good team."</TE>

<KH>THE UNTOLD WAR</KH>
<HD>'The Americans ... They Just Drop Their Bombs and Leave'</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: U.S. airstrikes were highly accurate, but
hundreds of civilians still died. Now, some survivors want
compensation.</DH>
<SE>THE UNTOLD WAR/ First of two parts</SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TORA BORA, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>After the American warplanes were gone and the hilltop village of
Mudoh lay in ruins, survivors tried to collect and bury their dead.</LD>
<LD>   There were problems. Most of the men and boys who had survived the
Nov. 30 airstrike were bloodied and dazed. The village cemetery was
not big enough to accommodate the dead. And the remains were not
intact.</LD>
<LD>   "No one should ever have to bury a baby's hand," said Janat Khan,
the silver-bearded mayor of Mudoh, who said he collected the body
parts of 15 villagers, wrapped them in plastic shopping bags and
buried them in a single grave.</LD>
<TE>   A new cemetery carved from a rocky bluff where the village once
stood holds the remains of 150 men, women and children, according to
villagers and pro-American commanders. They were killed, and the
village obliterated, by American warplanes during the battle that
drove Taliban and Al Qaeda forces from nearby Tora Bora.</TE>
<TE>   The carnage at Mudoh is the residue of a bombing campaign that,
while exceptionally accurate, nonetheless killed, at minimum,
hundreds of civilians and wounded thousands more. At 25 sites visited
by The Times, witnesses said U.S. warplanes killed and maimed civilians
because of unreliable intelligence, stray ordnance and faulty targeting,
or because enemy fighters mingled with civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Grieving villagers readily acknowledge that they are glad to be
rid of the Taliban. But they are puzzled and angry about the United
States' reluctance to apologize or provide compensation. More than
seven months after U.S. planes began dropping bombs, pain and
recriminations endure in villages across Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. bombs killed 45 men, women and children at the desert oasis
of Showkar Kariz near Kandahar on Oct. 22, according to pro-American
provincial officials and the only remaining inhabitant.</TE>
<TE>   Bombs killed four civilian passersby and eight pro-American
fighters of the Northern Alliance who were driving Toyota pickups
they had just captured from the Taliban at Tora Bora on Dec. 1. The
next day, district officials say, nine employees of the shura, or
council, in Pacheer-o-Agam near Tora Bora were killed by bombing
shortly after they took over the council office from the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   American bombs killed about 40 civilians at Esterghich, a village
north of Kabul, in early November during an airstrike on Taliban and
Al Qaeda fighters, said Northern Alliance soldiers from the village.</TE>
<TE>   Victims of such attacks are demanding compensation for their lost
loved ones and ruined villages. Some commanders who fought alongside
the Americans are adding their voices to the demands.</TE>
<TE>   'The Americans Didn't Even Apologize. They Never Do.'</TE>
<TE>   The question of reparations has prompted no significant debate in
the United States; there has been little public outcry or
congressional pressure on the Pentagon. Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S.
special representative to Afghanistan, said that when claims of
civilian casualties come to the attention of U.S. officials, "we
investigate and then we do the right thing to respond to the needs of
those who have suffered." Asked to define "the right thing,"
Khalilzad declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   A congressional delegation that visited Afghanistan in March said
Congress will consider reparations. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul says
the issue is being studied by the Pentagon and the State Department.
Interviewed in the ruins of villages, survivors seemed to harbor a deep
reservoir of anger for what they describe as American indifference and
denial.</TE>
<TE>   "The most the villagers got was a few truckloads of food from the
Americans," said Gul Amir Jan, a senior commander who worked with
Special Forces soldiers when he led Afghan troops in battle at Tora
Bora in December. "But the Americans didn't even apologize. They
never do."</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has acknowledged that civilians have died in U.S.
airstrikes, but it says Operation Enduring Freedom has been the most
accurate air campaign in history. "The use of precision weapons by
the coalition inside Afghanistan has been truly remarkable," said
Gen. Tommy Franks, chief of the U.S. Central Command.</TE>
<TE>   From Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld on down, military
officials have said that U.S. forces tried to minimize civilian
casualties, or "collateral damage." They have blamed enemy forces for
using civilians as cover, and they have denied claims by some Afghans
that civilian deaths resulted from false intelligence provided by
Afghan allies. Because conventional U.S. forces were not involved in
ground combat during most of the bombing campaign, American
commanders relied heavily on Afghan surrogates for on-the-ground
intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Col. James Yonts of the U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Fla.,
said that except for the captured trucks and district office near
Tora Bora, the locations cited in this article were legitimate
military targets. He said the U.S. military carefully selects its
targets to "inflict the maximum amount of impact against the enemy
with a minimal amount of collateral damage."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 21,737 bombs dropped by U.S. warplanes in Afghanistan,
about 60% were "smart" bombs guided by satellites or lasers, compared
with 10% during the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the Pentagon said. A
preliminary Pentagon study found that 75% to 80% of them hit their
targets in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The Defense Department has said it does not plan to count civilian
casualties. Relief officials with the U.S.-backed interim government
estimate the total civilian dead at 1,000 to 2,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Times reviewed more than 2,000 reports of civilian casualties
from U.S., British and Pakistani newspapers and international wire
services. After eliminating duplicate accounts, the review identified
194 incidents of civilian casualties from the start of the bombing on
Oct. 7 until Feb. 28, when the air campaign was largely completed.
The reported death toll, including estimates in some cases, was
between 1,067 and 1,201. The Times excluded 754 civilian deaths
reported by the Taliban but not independently confirmed, as well as
497 deaths that were not identified as either civilian or military.</TE>
<TE>   Those numbers suggest a very low civilian casualty rate compared
with earlier Afghan conflicts. During battles among warlords in Kabul
during the early 1990s, more than 50,000 civilians were killed,
according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. In the
western city of Herat, an estimated 20,000 civilians were killed in a
matter of days by Soviet air raids in March 1979, just a fraction of
the estimated 670,000 civilians who died during the 10-year Soviet
occupation.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent major U.S.-led air campaign before Afghanistan,
the 78-day North Atlantic Treaty Organization operation in Kosovo in
1999, killed about 500 civilians in 90 incidents, according to Human
Rights Watch.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, Afghans say, the problem was not accuracy but
intelligence. Pilots hit the right targets but killed the wrong
people.</TE>
<TE>   At Mudoh, the bombs and missiles that obliterated the hilltop
village hit their marks. Every single adobe dwelling was flattened,
killing men, women and children sleeping inside after their
late-night meals on the 15th day of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month
of dawn-to-dusk fasting. The 4 a.m. attack pulverized the
settlement's tiny mosque, destroyed storage bins filled with grain
and killed an entire herd of sheep and goats.</TE>
<TE>   "They killed our people, then they insult us by saying we're all
Taliban," said Piara Gul, 33, who said his wife, mother and seven
children were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Villagers said Mudoh was targeted because Afghan fighters who had
personal vendettas and land disputes with them told the Americans
that Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters had taken refuge there. Haji Lal
Mohammed, who commanded an Afghan unit at Tora Bora, said the
fighters settled the score by using satellite telephones supplied by
Special Forces to call their American patrons and tell them that the
village was an enemy hide-out.</TE>
<TE>   "There were no Taliban or Al Qaeda here. They were two mountain
ridges away--over there," Mohammed said, pointing to a dark ridge
line several miles away.</TE>
<TE>   The attack came at the height of the battle for Tora Bora, a
pivotal moment in the American effort to destroy the Taliban and Al
Qaeda and to hunt down Osama bin Laden, who was thought to be in the
area.</TE>
<TE>   Mudoh may have looked like a military outpost because villagers
had dug stones and clay from pits, which looked like foxholes, said
Khan, the mayor, who said he lost 15 family members. "But they should
have sent a spy here first, and he would have seen there were only
civilians living here."</TE>
<TE>   Yonts, the Central Command spokesman, said varying spellings for
remote Afghan villages make it difficult to determine the
circumstances of bombings. He said Mudoh is almost certainly a
village known to the U.S. military as Maduu, near Tora Bora, where he
said Al Qaeda fighters and their families were in underground bunkers
bombed Nov. 30.</TE>
<TE>   No bunkers or fortifications were visible in Mudoh, only the pits
dug by villagers.</TE>
<TE>   Today, about 100 survivors from Mudoh's 250 original inhabitants
live in the village, holed up in the ruins of mud huts. They have
stacked timbers and stones from their wrecked homes, hoping to
rebuild. From a distant ridge, the dominant landmark is the new
cemetery, filled with shahids, or martyrs, and marked by heaps of
stones and fluttering mourning flags.</TE>
<TE>   "Really, our village is gone," said Aya Gul, 42, who said he lost
a dozen family members. "The least the Americans can do is build it
back for us."</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed, the commander, said Special Forces officers told
him that the airstrike was a mistake. "They said they got bad
information," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Piara Gul, who said he has no family left, does not want an
apology. He wants vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   "I curse America," he said, kneeling over his wife's rocky
grave. "I put a curse on the Americans who did this. I pray they will
have the tragedy in their lives that I have had in mine."</TE>
<TE>   Just One Man Is Left in a Small Desert Oasis</TE>
<TE>   Bad information might have also resulted in the wholesale
destruction of Showkar Kariz, a desert oasis about 30 miles northeast
of Kandahar. Airstrikes on Oct. 22 killed 45 civilians, according to
United Nations officials and Mohammed Qasim, the sole remaining
inhabitant.</TE>
<TE>   Half an hour before the planes attacked, a white Toyota pulled up
outside the village and illuminated the walled compound of mud huts
with its high-beam headlights, Qasim said. He said the car belonged
to local people who had been feuding with the villagers over water
and grazing rights. The headlights were marking the target, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans gave these people satellite phones," Qasim said. "I
think they called and said there were Taliban here escaping from
Kandahar."</TE>
<TE>   The planes struck just after midnight, flattening several homes.
Survivors ran outside to cover up three cars and a tractor that they
believed were being targeted. Fifteen minutes later, a second
airstrike killed them, Qasim said. Among the victims of the second
strike was a small boy Qasim said he had just dug out alive from the
rubble of a hut. There were no Taliban or Al Qaeda fighters in the
area, Qasim said.</TE>
<TE>   The village is set in a vast desert plain, the only settlement in
miles and miles of wasteland. All that remains are tufts of singed
human hair, scraps of clothing and the clay foundations of homes and
a mosque.</TE>
<TE>   In January, eight Special Forces soldiers and a delegation of
provincial officials visited the village, according to Qasim and
Khalid Pushtoon, a provincial official. The Americans buried a
fragment of the World Trade Center and retrieved a shard of rubble
from the village.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans apologized and said the airstrike was an accident,
Qasim said.</TE>
<TE>   "They said maybe they would pay to rebuild the village, but I know
they were just saying that," Qasim said. "They didn't mean it.
They'll never pay. They don't care."</TE>
<TE>   Yonts said intelligence gathered before and after the strike
confirmed that the area around the village was a "combined Taliban-Al
Qaeda training camp," making it a "valid military target." However,
no evidence was visible that any sort of military camp had been in or
near the oasis. No traces of ammunition, weapons, military vehicles
or infrastructure are evident across the flat desert terrain.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of two boys from a distant settlement, Qasim tries
to keep the village alive. He has rebuilt his damaged hut and
repaired the water pump that keeps his field of wheat irrigated. He
said he lost part of his left thumb during the attack, and his left
hand is scarred and withered.</TE>
<TE>   Squinting in the brilliant desert sunshine, Qasim stood staring at
the ruins of his village.</TE>
<TE>   "These are war crimes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shifts on the Battlefield Contributed to Confusion</TE>
<TE>   In some instances, the capture of enemy equipment or territory
during the confusion of battle apparently caused U.S. warplanes to
hit the wrong targets.</TE>
<TE>   Gul Amir Jan said his soldiers captured four Toyota Hilux pickups
from the Taliban on Dec. 1 at Pacheer-o-Agam near Tora Bora. With a
battle still raging, the soldiers sped down a mountainside and took
cover in an adobe house at the edge of a gravel road.</TE>
<TE>   About 9 p.m., the house and the vehicles were bombed by U.S.
warplanes. Eight soldiers in the house and four civilians walking on
the road were killed, said Haji Lal Mohammed, Jan's deputy commander.</TE>
<TE>   According to Jan, American spy aircraft had earlier noted the
license numbers of the vehicles while confirming that the trucks
belonged to the Taliban. When warplanes spotted the trucks outside
the house, they assumed that Taliban fighters were inside, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you mix green wood with dry wood, they both burn," Mohammed
said, quoting a Persian proverb.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a mile away, Afghans working with the Americans took
over the Pacheer-o-Agam district office after it was abandoned by
Taliban fighters. The workers were sleeping inside when missiles
fired by U.S. warplanes leveled the building Dec. 2, killing nine
civilian workers and wounding 11, said district officer Noor Malang.
When other civilians came to their aid, Malang said, a second strike
wounded five more.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe the Americans thought the Taliban were still here," Malang
said, poking his foot through the charred rubble of the collapsed
building. "Or maybe these people who got satellite phones from the
Americans gave them bad information. Sometimes their information was
good, but sometimes it got innocent people killed."</TE>
<TE>   Yonts said U.S. forces did not realize that the sites had been
taken over by friendly forces.</TE>
<TE>   'Our Houses Were Bombed; Our Cattle Were Killed'</TE>
<TE>   Proximity to Taliban forces might have also led to the destruction
of Kuram, a village 22 miles west of Jalalabad. On Oct. 10, three
days after the air campaign began, U.S. bombs and missiles flattened
13 homes, killing 12 civilians and wounding 18, survivors said. The
victims were nomads known as Kochis. Abdul Basis Sayeed, a local
doctor, said there were no Taliban or Al Qaeda weapons depots or
training camps in the area.</TE>
<TE>   However, villagers said informers told the Americans that Taliban
fighters were using a road that runs past the village. They said the
bombing might have been related to U.S. attempts to deny the Taliban
access to the road.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Shah Khan, 20, said he and six family members were
sleeping when the bombing started. He said his mother was killed. He
showed a reporter scars from shrapnel wounds to his neck and legs.</TE>
<TE>   "Our houses were bombed; our cattle were killed. Innocent women
and children died," Khan said at the village, where the ground is
littered with shredded clothing and the bones of livestock. "Someone
should come and dry our tears." Haji Mohammed Zaman, a top commander
who worked closely with the Americans at Tora Bora and now hosts
Special Forces soldiers at his compound in Jalalabad, said he has
been unable to get answers from the Americans about civilian
casualties in his area.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked the Americans several times to at least help the
families, help rebuild their villages," Zaman said. "But they don't
seem interested."</TE>
<TE>   In Kandahar province, once the Taliban's stronghold, a preliminary
U.N. count found 415 civilians reported killed in U.S. airstrikes--364
men, 13 women and 38 children.  The numbers are based on inspections of
156 villages by U.N. mine-clearing teams.</TE>
<TE>   Again, villagers blamed false information from Afghan "spies"
supplied with satellite phones by the Americans, said Noor Ahmad
Azimi, supervisor of the U.N. teams.</TE>
<TE>   "Even more than money or other compensation, these people want
justice. They want these spies punished," Azimi said. "They tell us
the Americans should have verified their spies' information by coming
to the villages and seeing for themselves if there was any Taliban
there."</TE>
<TE>   The list of dead and wounded keeps growing because of unexploded
cluster bombs that continue to be detonated, Azimi said. He said U.N.
teams found 238 cluster bombs at 46 villages. With more than 200 tiny
bomblets within each yellow CBU-103 cluster bomb canister, nearly
50,000 "sub-munitions," or bomblets, were spread around the province.
Every week, he said, children playing in fields or adults collecting
scrap metal are killed or maimed. The Pentagon says U.S. forces
dropped more than 800 cluster bombs in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "So if you ask how many civilians were killed by U.S. bombs, we
can't say for sure," Azimi said. "We can only say that they will
continue to die for a long, long time."</TE>
<TE>   Other civilians in Kandahar province died during U.S. attacks
targeting fuel tankers supplying the Taliban and Al Qaeda, provincial
officials said. Although many vehicles destroyed by warplanes were
indeed carrying fuel for military use, the attacks also killed
civilians in other vehicles, said Leslie Oqvist, the U.N. regional
coordinator in Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no way for the U.S. military to know whether a vehicle
has military fuel or Al Qaeda fighters or farmers with loads of
vegetables," Oqvist said. "As military strategy, the U.S. approach
was quite successful. From a human rights viewpoint, it was a
disaster."</TE>
<TE>   Haji Abdullah Wafa, head of the provincial transportation
department, said a survey by the local truckers' cooperative found
that more cars were destroyed than tankers--210 cars and 160 tankers.
Wafa said any vehicle on the highway east of Kandahar leading to
Kabul was a target. Scorched, rusted tankers and cars still line the
road.</TE>
<TE>   "They hit everything--tankers, trucks, cars, taxis, farm
vehicles," Wafa said. "It was a very confusing time, because you had
Taliban and Al Qaeda and civilians on the road at the same time, all
trying to get out of Kandahar."</TE>
<TE>   Wafa said many civilians were spared because the warplanes often
fired warning shots, giving drivers and passengers an opportunity to
flee.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes they would wait and then destroy the empty vehicle,"
Wafa said. "Sometimes they would just leave it alone."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the attacks, Wafa said, people are glad to be rid of the
Taliban and Al Qaeda, and they accept a certain level of civilian
casualties.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans helped us so much," he said. "They should do one
last thing and pay the people for what they have lost."</TE>
<TE>   Village Had Expected to Be Target of Attacks</TE>
<TE>   Even at some villages obliterated by U.S. warplanes, residents
said they were prepared to tolerate the bombing campaign because it
drove out the Taliban and Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   At Esterghich on the Shomali plain north of Kabul, survivors of a
November airstrike said they expected to be attacked because of
Taliban and Al Qaeda command posts and weapons depots in the village.
Esterghich was next to the no man's land between Taliban and Northern
Alliance forces near Bagram air base north of Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   The raid killed about 25 fighters but also left about 40 civilians
dead, according to survivors and pro-American fighters in the
village.</TE>
<TE>   Today, survivors live in the crumbling remains of houses next to
fruit trees shredded by shrapnel. They pointed out two command posts
where they said Arab fighters were based, and they led the way to two
huts still stacked high with Taliban rockets, grenades and mortar
rounds.</TE>
<TE>   Shir Alam, 13, who said he hid in the hills with his family the
night of the bombing, told of kicking and spitting on the bodies of
Arab fighters the next morning. "Because of them, our village was
destroyed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ghulam Dastagir, who said he fought for the Northern Alliance unit
that took the village from the Taliban, said his wife and brother
died in the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   "I blame the Arabs," he said, standing in the ruins of his
brother's home. "But I also blame the Americans. They have smart
bombs. They could have aimed them at the Arabs and left the civilian
houses alone."</TE>
<TE>   Other villagers said they lost family members who tried to flee
Esterghich in a Mercedes bus that was destroyed by an American
missile on the highway to Kabul. The villagers said 18 people died,
among them several Taliban fighters also fleeing the village. Today,
six green flags mark the mangled chassis of the bus on the shoulder
of the Bagram highway.</TE>
<TE>   An ammunition depot set among civilians also caused the
destruction of Qalaye Niazy just north of Gardez in Paktia province.
Over the objection of residents, a Taliban commander stored weapons and
ammunition there as Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters were fleeing the area,
according to villagers and a pro-American commander.</TE>
<TE>   Airstrikes on Dec. 29 destroyed most of the weapons depot but also
killed 52 civilians who had gathered for a wedding celebration,
according to a Western aid organization. The group provided a copy of
its report on the incident, on the condition that it not be
identified. The report, based on interviews with 23 survivors, listed
the names of the victims and included a map showing the five houses
that were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Yonts said the compound was occupied at the time by senior Al
Qaeda leadership. He said two surface-to-air missiles were fired at
U.S. aircraft from the compound.</TE>
<TE>   Now, only the foundations of the compound's adobe houses remain,
along with the ruins of the house that had held the weapons depot.
The desert floor is covered with scraps of weapons and ammunition,
plus several boxes of rockets and grenades still in their protective
plastic wrappers.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans never admitted they made a mistake," said Abdul
Rahim, a U.S.-backed commander in Gardez. "They just say everybody
there was Al Qaeda."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Rahim said, the airstrike helped rout the Taliban and Al
Qaeda. "Even if twice as many civilians died, it's still OK. That's
the price we have to pay," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Kabul, U.S. Strikes Get High Marks for Accuracy</TE>
<TE>   After 23 years of fighting, Kabul is an archeological site for the
study of war. The destruction from previous combat is wholesale and
indiscriminate. The damage from the American campaign, in most cases,
is limited and contained.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban's largest ammunition depot was in the southeast Kabul
district of Pul-e-Charkhi. Today, the depot is an expanse of
pulverized buildings, rockets and ammunition. Yet no civilians were
killed in the airstrikes, according to residents.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, residents said no bombs went astray when the U.S.
bombed a large military motor pool in an eastern Kabul neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   However, residents said six civilians in two buildings across a
highway from the motor pool were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the victims, civilian guards at a defunct tile factory,
were killed in one strike, they said. Aman Ullah, who lives next to
the site, said the Americans apparently thought that Taliban fighters
had retreated to the factory from the motor pool.</TE>
<TE>   A second strike killed four employees in the office of an Afghan
de-mining organization, Afghan Technical Consultants, residents said.
They said they believed that the office was targeted because it was
next to two tall, rusted towers of a long-defunct radio station.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most precisely targeted American strikes were in the
upper-class neighborhood of Karte Parwan in northern Kabul, where
senior Taliban and Al Qaeda commanders lived. The roofs of three
heavily guarded private homes were neatly penetrated by bombs or
missiles that exploded inside. But homes on either side were
undamaged and their occupants uninjured, according to neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "Those American bombs and missiles--they go straight to the
point," said Haji Abdul Mohammed, a burly neighborhood man who was
supervising the rebuilding of a villa-like compound set on a
hillside.</TE>
<TE>   The compound had been a military command post, he said. The wrecks
of military trucks and antiaircraft guns lay in the grass beneath
tall pines out front. Signs in Persian script on a wall read:
"Taliban: Live and die for jihad," and "Soldiers: Do not come through
this door. For commanders only." Neighbors said Bin Laden stayed
there briefly in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed pointed out holes in the entryway ceiling and foyer wall
where a missile or bomb had sliced through and exploded.</TE>
<TE>   "It killed several [Al Qaeda] Arabs, which is good," he said. "And
it didn't kill any civilians, which is also good."</TE>
<TE>   The story was similar at House No. 4 on Street 4 in Karte Parwan,
Phase Two, where neighbors say the Taliban interior minister lived.
He was not home the night in early November when an American bomb tore
through the structure just below the turquise-tiled mural ceiling and
sprayed the prayer room with shrapnel, said Nazir Ahmad, a neighborhood
resident who was repairing the house.</TE>
<TE>   Six Taliban fighters who had been in the room were killed, Ahmad
said. Gray fragments of the bomb were displayed on the fireplace
mantel, complete with serial numbers and markings in English. Houses
on either side were undamaged. No civilians were hurt, Ahmad said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans did a very good job," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But at other bombing sites, airstrikes have left a legacy of
resentment.</TE>
<TE>   Ten miles west of Kandahar, residents of the village of Sanziri
said they were gratified when U.S. airstrikes began driving the
Taliban and Al Qaeda from the province. But during an air raid the
night of Nov. 27, which Yonts said was aimed at a "Taliban leadership
target," a bomb or missile ripped into a mud and clay house where 15
members of the Sedeq family were sleeping.</TE>
<TE>   The house was flattened. According to witnesses, 10 men, women and
children died beneath the rubble.</TE>
<TE>   Fazel Sedeq, the family patriarch, spoke the names of the dead. "I
lost my wife, my daughter, my nephew, my daughter-in-law, my son,
five of my grandchildren," he said, squatting in the shade beside
mounds of clay and earth that were once his home.</TE>
<TE>   Sedeq said Taliban fighters had been in the village in the weeks
before the attack but not on the night of the raid. He said the
Taliban's Toyota Land Cruisers were among the vehicles that used a
dirt road that connects the village to the main highway to Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   Sedeq walked from the ruins of his home to the rocky family
graveyard, where 10 mourning flags fluttered. He held his chubby
18-month-old grandson, Najibullah; he said he had rescued the child
from the rubble of the collapsed house.</TE>
<TE>   "We are ruined," he said. "We thought the Americans were good
people. But they just drop their bombs and leave. They don't explain.
They don't apologize. They don't even offer to pay for what they
did."</TE>
<TE>   Money would not bring back his family, Sedeq said, but it would
show Afghans that the U.S. is willing to take responsibility for its
mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans have lost the hearts of the people," he said,
staring down at his wife's grave. "Who can love America now?"</TE>

bombing that killed 19 U.S. service personnel, but the main suspects
are still at large, the deputy interior minister was quoted as
saying.</LD>
<LD>   No details of the sentences were given. Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz
told the Saudi newspaper Al Jazeera that two or three of the main
suspects remain at large.</LD>
<LD>   Washington last year indicted 13 members of the group called Saudi
Hezbollah and a Lebanese man in the June 25, 1996, truck bombing
outside a U.S. barracks in Dhahran. The blast wounded 372 U.S.

<LD>Argentina announced plan to slowly phase out a hated banking freeze,
offering account holders a chance to convert billions of dollars in
savings into bonds that mature in three to 10 years.</LD>
<LD>   Economy Minister Roberto Lavagna promised the plan would "rebuild
a financial system" near collapse, but critics noted that depositors
would still have to wait years to get their savings back.</LD>
<LD>   Depositors would have 30 days to accept the bonds or stick to an
established schedule for banks to return the money in coming years.</LD>

President Fernando de la Rua.</TE>

<LD>An independent Russian TV station whose closure in January triggered
concerns about media freedoms in Russia went back on the air, but
under the eye of a politician with strong Kremlin links.</LD>
<LD>   TVS, formerly TV6, returned with roughly the same team of liberal
journalists. But authorities returned control only after staffers had
teamed up with business heavyweights and politicians, including
political veteran Yevgeny M. Primakov, a former prime minister with
close Kremlin connections. Primakov has said he will not interfere
with coverage.</LD>

<HD>Palestinian Killed at Mosque</HD>
<DH>Mideast: A man who defied curfew is shot outside the
building in the West Bank. The Israeli army says there was an
exchange of fire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NABLUS, West Bank</DL>
<LD>A young Palestinian who defied curfew to pray in a mosque was killed
by Israeli soldiers in this hillside city Saturday as the army
continued its West Bank raids in search of suspected militants.</LD>
<LD>   Tareq el Kharaz, 24, was shot outside a mosque in the Old City,
witnesses said. It was the second day of curfew in Nablus, known for
its soap, candy and militant Palestinian activists. The army said the
man had died in an exchange of fire.</LD>
<LD>   By late Saturday, hundreds of Palestinians had been detained in
raids on four West Bank cities and villages, and more than 59 were in
Israeli custody.</LD>
<TE>   The raids came as attempts to nudge the region back toward
negotiations continued Saturday. Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat met European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana
and Egyptian intelligence chief Omar Suleiman. A day earlier, Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon met U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
William Burns. No new peace initiatives have emerged.</TE>
<TE>   A hot, eerie quiet covered the streets of Nablus at midday. In
contrast to the fighting that ensued when Israeli tanks moved into
this town in early April, this weekend's raids met only scattered and
weak opposition--a sign that Israel's renewed strategy of dismantling
Palestinian militant bands with quick, hard attacks is taking a toll.</TE>
<TE>   "The first strike made our resistance weak," a veteran activist
from the Fatah movement, who spoke on condition he not be named, said
Saturday. "The resistance is trying to rebuild its internal
situation."</TE>
<TE>   Roads to Nablus were choked shut Saturday by concrete blocks,
hastily dug ditches and clusters of Israeli soldiers. The streets
were lined with shuttered pharmacies and apartments, locked cafes and
deserted stoops. Small fires blazed in the empty streets near An
Najah University.</TE>
<TE>   On the outskirts of town, soldiers sealed off streets and searched
homes in the Balata refugee camp. The camp is the birthplace and
stronghold of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militant Palestinian
group that is affiliated with Fatah and claims responsibility for
many of the suicide bombings and shooting attacks on Israeli
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   "This time, the Israelis are arresting anyone who they even think
might resist them," the Fatah activist said. Many of the Al Aqsa
leaders have been slain or jailed, he said, and their absence has
splintered the group.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the West Bank, Israeli soldiers used explosives to
blow down doors in the village of Tamoun.</TE>
<TE>   For the third day in a row, troops rolled into Bethlehem before
sunrise to pluck a suspect from the neighboring Dahaisha refugee
camp. Israeli tanks also stormed the town of Tulkarm.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians say the raids are excessive, oppressive measures that
prove Israel's unwillingness to negotiate a peace settlement. The
Israeli government argues that it must dismantle the militant
organizations to save itself from Palestinian attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel's position is that cessation of terror, violence and
incitement and a thorough reform of the Palestinian Authority were
conditions for progress in the diplomatic process," a statement from
Sharon's office said.</TE>
<TE>   But in a land of perpetual violence, strings of vengeance can be
hard to cut.</TE>
<TE>   The refugee camp here is a portrait of revenge: On May 22, Israeli
soldiers in Balata killed Mahmoud Titi, one of the area's Al Aqsa
leaders. Five days later, Jihad Titi walked up to an ice cream parlor
outside Tel Aviv and blew himself up to avenge his cousin's death.
Ruth Peled, 56, and her 18-month-old granddaughter, Sinai Keinan,
were killed in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Israeli troops in Balata dealt another blow in the
feud. Soldiers ordered surviving Titi family members to abandon their
house, then blasted it to bits with explosives.</TE>
<TE>   The daily hit-and-run strikes on the Palestinian territories lack
the magnitude of recent warfare, but the crackdown has managed to
exert steady pressure nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troop movements are as frequent as they are unpredictable.
Ditches, concrete barricades and impromptu checkpoints appear
overnight to block routes through Palestinian territories, paralyzing
first one town, then another. "Nobody can get in, and nobody can get
out," a Nablus security official said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the West Bank cities, this sloping landscape of mosques and
crumbling ruins suffered the worst damage during Israel's April
campaign. In a relentless attack, Israeli shells blew ancient Nablus
buildings to dust and pebbles.</TE>
<TE>   "From age 17, they are preparing to be martyrs. They are running
toward that," the Fatah activist said. "[Israelis] are dreaming if
they think they think they can finish the martyrs."</TE>

<HD>26 Indians Massacred in Mexico Land Feud</HD>
<DH>Violence: Gunmen from a competing town ambushed forestry
workers, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Gunmen assaulted a truck on a mountain road in southern Mexico,
killing 26 Zapotec Indian forestry workers in a region plagued by
bloody disputes over land, officials said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The Friday evening massacre was believed to be the worst recorded
in 15 years in the violence-prone state of Oaxaca. Law enforcement
officials said the killers, who escaped, were apparently motivated by
a feud over 27,000 acres of timberland and cornfields.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators said the victims, all young men, had crowded into
the truck's open-topped cargo section after a day of logging pine and
were riding toward their homes in the community of Santiago
Xochiltepec. The Oaxaca state attorney general's office said an armed
gang forced the truck to a halt about 7 p.m., ordered the driver to
leave the area and opened fire on the passengers from a ridge above a
road.</LD>
<TE>   "They died in an ambush," Oaxaca Police Commander Jonas Gutierrez
Coro said.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the 28 riders in the back of the truck were wounded and
taken to a hospital in Oaxaca city, the state capital.</TE>
<TE>   Oaxaca's attorney general, Sergio Santibanez, led a team of 184
police officers and investigators to the ambush site, about 200 miles
southeast of Mexico City. The state's governor, Jose Murat, ordered
"the most exhaustive investigation into these lamentable events" and
the arrest of the killers.</TE>
<TE>   Alberto Antonio Perez, who was driving the truck, is assisting in
the probe, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The feud that apparently prompted the killing pitted Santiago
Xochiltepec and its 1,000 Zapotec Indians against a nearby
Spanish-speaking village, Santo Domingo de Teojomulco, that is four
times its size.</TE>
<TE>   Froylan Juarez, a logger from Santiago Xochiltepec, said a Oaxaca
court ruled in favor of the indigenous community in the dispute March
6. Two weeks later, he said, the village came under fire by gunmen
from the rival settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "They are trying to threaten us so that we give up defending our
land, and now they have carried out this horrible massacre," Juarez
said by telephone.</TE>
<TE>   Violent disputes over land, which in part gave rise to the Mexican
Revolution of 1910, are still common in large areas of the
countryside.</TE>
<TE>   They have persisted despite a massive redistribution of large
estates to peasant farmers in the middle decades of the 20th
century--a program that has been abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   Competition for land is especially intense in Oaxaca's densely
populated mountain valleys. Human rights groups have faulted the
government for taking sides in some disputes or at least failing to
police the feuding communities.</TE>

<HD>Israel Errs on Identity of Blast Suspect</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A woman arrested on suspicion of complicity in a Palestinian suicide
bombing last week was a former Ukrainian prostitute, not a Jewish
immigrant to Israel as originally stated, Israel's Shin Bet secret
service said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   It said in a statement issued via the Israeli prime minister's
office that the woman, Irena Plitzik, was arrested May 23 with her
Palestinian husband and was using the identity card of his cousin's
Israeli wife, Marina Pinsky. Both of the men are named Ibrahim
Sarachne.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect was thus misidentified Thursday, Shin Bet said, adding
that Pinsky--a Russian immigrant--had no connection to the evening
attack in the Tel Aviv suburb of Rishon Le Zion.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli television said Pinsky alerted authorities to the mistake
after seeing her name in Israeli newspapers Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of Israeli Arabs have been arrested on suspicion of aiding
the 20-month-old Palestinian uprising, but such complicity on the
part of Israeli Jews is almost unheard of.</TE>
<TE>   Shin Bet said the woman who was arrested came to Israel from
Ukraine several years ago, working as a prostitute and eventually
marrying one of her Palestinian clients. She was described as
Christian, not Jewish.</TE>
<TE>   The couple were arrested a day after they drove a 17-year-old
militant from the Bethlehem area to Rishon Le Zion in central Israel,
where he blew himself up, killing two Israelis and wounding 36.</TE>
<TE>   Plitzik told Israeli interrogators that she did not know of the
planned bombing in advance, according to previous statements from
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's office.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Concerns About Musharraf Are Mounting</HD>
<DH>Asia: To Pakistanis, Kashmir is a more contentious issue
than the leader's role in war on terror. It could cost him the
presidency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As tensions build in South Asia, the United States is increasingly
worried about the fate of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, a
central player in the war on terrorism whom the Bush administration
considers a model of moderation for the turbulent Islamic world.</LD>
<LD>   What happens next between India and Pakistan will depend heavily
on what the Pakistani general decides to do, U.S. officials say. And
the pressures he faces over the disputed Kashmir region are far
greater than those growing out of his support for the U.S. campaign
in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, Musharraf tried to calm world fears of a catastrophic
conflict, saying that neither Pakistan nor India is "irresponsible"
enough to use its nuclear weapons.</LD>
<TE>   "One shouldn't even be discussing these things, because any sane
individual cannot even think of going into this unconventional war,"
he said in an interview with CNN.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Musharraf's options for preventing some kind of conflict range
from unappetizing to dangerous. Some could even undermine his hold on
power at a time when Washington still needs his support in tracking
down terrorists with the Al Qaeda network who have evaded American
forces in the region for seven months.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the toughest test of his political life," a senior Bush
administration official said, asking to remain anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition to Musharraf at home is growing. Islamic militants
distributed leaflets around mosques Friday, the Muslim Sabbath,
calling on Pakistanis to overthrow him because he is a "corrupt
policeman" acting only on behalf of the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   And the Bush administration's concern goes beyond pressure on the
Pakistani leader from militants. Musharraf is trapped in a
potentially untenable position within a wider swath of society as he
struggles to accommodate demands from his restive population, his
U.S. allies and his Indian rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf has already tempted the fates by defying public opinion
when he sided with the United States after Sept. 11 and turned
against the Taliban--a radical Islamic movement that was largely
created by Pakistani intelligence services in an effort to ensure at
least one friendly border.</TE>
<TE>   And reining in Islamic extremists involved with Kashmiri
separatism is a much more contentious issue than nabbing Al Qaeda and
Taliban fighters in Afghanistan or along the Pakistani border.</TE>
<TE>   "It took courage for Musharraf to acknowledge that supporting the
Taliban was a failure and a strategic blunder. But to do the same
thing on his Kashmir policy may be a bridge too far," said Ellen
Laipson, president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a Washington think
tank, and former vice chairman of the National Intelligence Council.</TE>
<TE>   "Kashmir is so fundamental to Pakistani political identity that
it's much harder, in terms of political stability, to walk away from
Kashmir too," Laipson said.</TE>
<TE>   For Pakistanis, ending India's control of a large chunk of
predominantly Muslim Kashmir is a national cause dating back to the
founding of the state in 1947. Several Islamic militant groups,
including some with links to Al Qaeda, still have public support or
empathy because they are perceived as freedom fighters struggling to
liberate Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   So going against the popular will imperils Musharraf's position at
home, analysts warn.</TE>
<TE>   "Were he to totally stop all forms of activity, including
paramilitary support to the militants in Kashmir, there would be a
domestic backlash that would be very, very powerful," Laipson said.
"Some of the military would almost certainly turn against him."</TE>
<TE>   Tensions with India have a personal angle for Musharraf. He was
born in India in 1943; his family left New Delhi when the end of
British rule led to partition and Muslim-dominated Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Kashmir has also long been a professional preoccupation for
Musharraf. A hawk on security issues, he orchestrated the 1999
military incursion across the so-called Line of Control between the
two sections of Kashmir when he was head of Pakistan's army.</TE>
<TE>   Only intervention by President Clinton, who invited Pakistan's
then-prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, to Washington for hastily arranged
talks, led Pakistan to pull back. But military and public anger after
the withdrawal played a role in Sharif's ouster only months later in
a bloodless coup led by Musharraf.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf's hawkish tendencies were underscored last month when,
amid rising hostilities along the border with India, he moved to test
nuclear-capable missiles.</TE>
<TE>   Yet India and the U.S. now demand that Musharraf act to stop the
insurgency over Kashmir. If he doesn't end the cross-border
infiltrations, he confronts the very real danger of Indian
retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf would then face extraordinary pressure to strike
back--and risk a full-scale war.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Indians do anything that embarrasses him, then he's
compelled to respond forcefully. This is the escalation scenario,"
said Stephen Philip Cohen, a South Asia expert at the Brookings
Institution in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan would then be engaged in a war it almost certainly could
not win, because it is significantly outgunned and outmanned by
India's security forces.</TE>
<TE>   Yet yielding to world pressure and opting not to respond if India
took military action "would really hurt him," Cohen said. It could
well cost Musharraf one--and potentially all three--of the positions
he holds as president, prime minister and army chief, he predicted.</TE>
<TE>   There are even potential costs if Musharraf is seen as complying
with U.S. requests to ease back from the brink, which will be made in
person this week by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Deputy
Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-Musharraf leaflets, distributed by the radical Muslim
group Hizbul Tehreer, charged that Pakistan has been "consigned to
the sidelines" by a new U.S. friendship with India. Washington's
enemies are "now perceived to be Muslims," the leaflets said.</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment isn't limited to militants.</TE>
<TE>   "Musharraf is vulnerable at home because of the deep
anti-Americanism even among Westernized Pakistanis. So he may yet pay
the price for this alliance with the United States," Cohen said.
"He's now more vulnerable than he's ever been."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the world may have to lower its expectations--and
demands--to ensure his survival.</TE>
<TE>   "Think about what happens if he falls," Laipson said. "We could
then get a Pakistan that is even more troublesome if he's replaced by
hard-liners. So we may have to be realistic about whether he can
comply 100%."</TE>

<HD>One Misstep Away From Nuclear War</HD>
<DH>South Asia: Musharraf calls use of atomic weapons
unthinkable. But the India-Pakistan conflict 'tends toward
surprises,' an expert says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER and THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf insisted Saturday that "any sane
individual" cannot contemplate a nuclear war between Pakistan and
India, but U.S. officials and other experts say history's first such
battle could erupt if conventional fighting breaks out over bitterly
contested Kashmir and one side makes a mistake or misjudges its foe.</LD>
<LD>   In one widely discussed scenario, if conventional fighting
escalated beyond a clash in the Himalayan region, Pakistan could set
off a nuclear weapon over an unpopulated area of India in an effort
to intimidate its far larger foe. (India has about 1.2 million
active-duty troops, compared with Pakistan's 600,000.) Instead of
persuading India to back down, a Pakistani bomb might provoke
full-scale nuclear retaliation.</LD>
<LD>   Nuclear war could also come as a result of mistakes in judgment by
subordinate military commanders in the field, or from an accidental
mishandling of the nuclear materials that are now being shifted
around the battlefield, some experts say.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a region that tends toward misreadings, tends toward
surprises, tends toward misperceptions," said Michael Krepon,
founding president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a Washington think
tank. "In all of their wars, they have tended toward misreadings."</TE>
<TE>   There is no question that if a nuclear exchange occurred, it would
inflict a horrific toll.</TE>
<TE>   According to a Defense Intelligence Agency assessment made public
last week, a full-scale exchange could kill as many as 12 million
people and could injure as many as 6 million more, not including
victims of long-term radiation. The casualties would include U.S.
troops stationed in the region. And the devastation would create a
humanitarian and economic disaster that would scar the region for
decades.</TE>
<TE>   The effects of radiation in areas much farther away, such as the
United States and Europe, would probably be small, however, analysts
say.</TE>
<TE>   Experts such as Krepon and government officials stress that they
don't believe Musharraf or Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee
intend to resort to nuclear weapons. Some specialists say they don't
expect the present crisis to lead even to a major conventional war,
as India and Pakistan waged over Kashmir in 1947-48 and 1965.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf, speaking to CNN on Saturday, downplayed the risks of a
nuclear war. "I don't think either side is that irresponsible to go
to that limit," he said. "I would even go to the extent of saying one
shouldn't even be discussing these things, because any sane
individual cannot even think of going into this unconventional war,
whatever the pressures."</TE>
<TE>   This morning, Musharraf arrived in Tajikistan, bound for a
16-nation Asian security conference in Kazakhstan that Vajpayee also
will attend. The two are not expected to meet one on one, however.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Musharraf's reassurances, hundreds of United Nations staff
members in Pakistan and India have been ordered to send their
families home, a U.N. official told Associated Press in Islamabad,
the Pakistani capital, on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The order came a day after the United States urged more than
60,000 Americans to leave India immediately and authorized the
departure of U.S. nonemergency personnel as soon as possible.
Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, France and South Korea
released similar warnings to their citizens in India. Most already
had issued similar advice for Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Kashmir represents a special danger because of 50 years of
bloodshed there coupled with the two countries' vagueness about what
enemy actions would cause them to launch a nuclear attack, experts
say.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions between the uneasy neighbors have risen since a deadly
attack on India's Parliament building in December that left 14 people
dead, including five gunmen. India accuses Pakistan-based Kashmir
separatists of launching the brazen raid. Soon after, India began a
buildup of forces that has now brought almost 1 million Indian and
Pakistani troops to the border region.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts believe that the first step toward war could come in
the form of a new terrorist attack by the Islamic militants.</TE>
<TE>   If that happens, India might react by launching a counterattack on
the areas in the Pakistani-controlled portion of Kashmir where the
militants are alleged to have been training. This attack could be
carried out by Indian air force fighters or through a coordinated
assault by fighter-bombers, tanks and ground combat forces.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts believe India might try to push farther north, to
seize the mountain passes through which the militants enter the
Indian-held portion of Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   Under this scenario, Pakistan would feel pressure to counterattack
in the face of an Indian assault and might strike back at Indian
troops, artillery and fighter squadrons concentrated near the border.</TE>
<TE>   All that would remain within the realm of conventional fighting,
but experts say India's numerical superiority is so great that such
incursions could convince Pakistan that its existence was threatened.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Pakistani officials haven't ruled out the use of
nuclear weapons against a conventional attack. India, however, has
pledged no first use.</TE>
<TE>   Teresita C. Schaffer, a former U.S. diplomat now at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, said
the danger is that a series of tit-for-tat conventional exchanges
could lead to uncontrolled escalation.</TE>
<TE>   The most likely trigger for a nuclear war would be a conclusion by
Pakistan that its "national integrity" was threatened by a loss of
territory, military assets or transportation links, or an attack on a
city, she wrote in article on the think tank's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "The key point about nuclear weapons in South Asia is
uncertainty," she wrote. "No one can be certain what would trigger a
nuclear response, and the world needs to take the risk seriously."</TE>
<TE>   There is little question that India and Pakistan could reach
targets in each other's territory with nuclear warheads.</TE>
<TE>   Both countries have nuclear arsenals numbering in the low dozens
of warheads, according to U.S. officials. Analysts at defense
publisher Jane's Information Group say India has 100 to 150 warheads
and Pakistan 25 to 50.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is not clear that Pakistan's missiles are reliable
enough to pose a major threat to India, nuclear-equipped Pakistani
F-16 fighters could probably penetrate India's air defenses. India
could probably strike Pakistan with both missiles and bombers.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's nuclear arms are believed to be concentrated in a small
number of locations, a fact that could cause the Indians to think
that they could wipe them out with a preemptive attack. For that
reason, some experts believe that Pakistan is moving its nuclear
explosives around the countryside, to make them harder to destroy.</TE>
<TE>   India's nuclear arms are more widely dispersed, making a
preemptive strike less practical.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some experts argue that the tit-for-tat attacks would not
necessarily escalate.</TE>
<TE>   Terrence Taylor, a South Asia expert and head of the U.S.
operation of the London-based International Institute for Strategic
Studies, said India has no strategic reason to want
Pakistani-controlled territory in Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   India only wants to stop the militants' attacks, he says, and
probably would withdraw without much delay if it did invade. He
judges a nuclear exchange as "extraordinarily unlikely" and said he
doubts that there will be a conventional war either.</TE>
<TE>   Although a nuclear exchange in Kashmir would be devastating for
people in the immediate area, the impact on distant areas could be
less than many people think, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The death rate would be high within a five-mile area of the blast
but would decline sharply within another five miles. In the long
term, there would probably be a measurable increase in cancer deaths
within 100 miles downwind of the detonation, but only minuscule
health effects beyond that area, said Arthur Upton, a radiation
expert who formerly headed the National Cancer Institute and is now
at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the worst of circumstances, with multiple detonations, the
amount of radiation that would be spread to Europe and the United
States would be much less than existing background levels in those
areas, Fred Mettler of the University of New Mexico added.</TE>
<TE>   But it is difficult to predict the extent of radiation spread
precisely, because many factors play into it, all experts agreed. The
most crucial factor is whether the blasts occur on the ground or in
the air. A nuclear blast in the air produces a bigger fireball and
more destruction in the immediate blast area, but little fallout,
said physicist John D. Boice Jr. of the Vanderbilt University Medical
School.</TE>
<TE>   The bombs that exploded in Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of
World War II were both detonated in the air, and "there was no
fallout," he said. "The radiation didn't travel at all." As a
consequence, the health effects observed were in people directly
exposed to radiation from the blast.</TE>
<TE>   But if a bomb is detonated on the ground, huge quantities of dirt
are vaporized and hurled into the sky, carrying radioactive isotopes
such as strontium, cesium and iodine with them. If this fallout
reaches the stratosphere, it can travel long distances.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, fallout from above-ground nuclear tests conducted in the
1950s and 1960s was dispersed throughout the world, even to the North
and South Poles. But it gets diluted very rapidly so that little
falls to the ground in any one area unless there are highly unusual
meteorological conditions.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of one U.S. test in the 1950s, for example, a
massive thunderstorm in upstate New York washed measurable
concentrations of strontium and iodine out of the atmosphere so that
radiation levels around Troy, for example, were higher than those in
states next to the Nevada test site.</TE>
<TE>   But there were still no measurable health effects as a result,
Boice added.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have been able to make some predictions based on the
1986 Chernobyl accident, in which a fire in the Ukrainian nuclear
power plant sent relatively large amounts of fallout into the
atmosphere. That fallout was ultimately detected all around the
world. But the primary health effect observed was an increase in
thyroid tumors within a radius of 30 to 50 miles downwind.</TE>
<TE>   If nuclear war came to South Asia, Upton said, "the biggest
concern I have is that, according to the estimates I have seen,
millions of people could be killed in that part of the world."</TE>
<TE>   "That would be an enormous tragedy," he said. "That we would have
detectable levels of radioactivity as far away as the United States
is unfortunate but not a public health concern."</TE>

<HD>Kim's Laurels Appear to Be Greener Abroad</HD>
<DH>S. Korea: Sons' scandal woes are just one aspect of the
lame-duck leader's problems. At home, the last year of a president's
term is often the worst.</DH>

<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>One might say he is a prophet scorned in his own land.</LD>
<LD>   From afar, South Korean President Kim Dae Jung looks like one of
the most respected leaders in the world. He is credited with reducing
tensions on the Korean peninsula to their lowest level in more than
50 years, with expertly defusing an international monetary crisis and
with presiding over a country that is richer and freer than at any
time in its history.</LD>
<LD>   But at home, the 77-year-old former dissident is increasingly the
butt of jokes, an object of ridicule and pity.</LD>
<TE>   His popularity has plunged as prosecutors close in on his three
sons, who are allegedly enmeshed in a tangle of corruption scandals.
His youngest son was arrested May 18 on charges that he took nearly
$2 million in bribes from a lobbyist. Earlier in the month, one of
the president's most trusted fund-raisers was arrested on another
corruption charge. Besieged, Kim resigned from the ruling party.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Kim's Nobel Peace Prize-winning "sunshine policy" of
engagement with North Korea is at best in a period of eclipse.</TE>
<TE>   Political cartoons in South Korean papers depict the president as
a sickly old man unable to govern and unable to protect his family.
It doesn't help that he was hospitalized in April for a leg injury.</TE>
<TE>   "At this moment, he cannot govern the country. He has lost all
trust and moral legitimacy," said Hahn Sung Deuk, a Korea University
political scientist who is a specialist on the Korean presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Part of Kim's problem is that he's a lame-duck president, in his
last year in office and barred by South Korea's Constitution from
seeking another five-year term. In other countries, Kim might be
looking forward to a comfortable retirement--a chance to rest on his
laurels, as it were--but the last year of a South Korean president's
term is usually the most turbulent.</TE>
<TE>   "Korean presidents always seem to end up as pariahs. In their last
year in office, their power wanes and all sorts of things begin to
come out," said Michael Breen, a Korea expert who is writing a
biography of Kim. "There is a lot of money in the political business,
and basically if they want to go after you, they can always find
something. And if they can't get you, they go after your children."</TE>
<TE>   It might be no coincidence that almost five years ago, the son of
Kim's predecessor, Kim Young Sam, was arrested on similar corruption
charges. And before that, the daughter of previous President Roh Tae
Woo was embroiled in a scandal in which it was alleged (but never
proved) that she accepted valuable gifts to influence government
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Dae Jung has not been accused of wrongdoing, but the
scandals--which are, in the words of a diplomat here, "more
complicated than a mosaic in a Byzantine cathedral"--touch on
virtually every member of his immediate family.</TE>
<TE>   His oldest son, 54-year-old Kim Hong Il--a member of the National
Assembly who, like his father, was imprisoned in the 1980s by South
Korea's military dictatorship--is accused by the political opposition
of campaign fund-raising irregularities. The second son, Kim Hong Up,
is under investigation for allegedly mishandling funds of the Kim Dae
Jung Peace Foundation for the Asia-Pacific Region, a think tank the
president set up with the hope it would polish his legacy.</TE>
<TE>   In the Confucian tradition that holds sway here, fathers are held
more responsible for their children's failings than in the West, so
this scandal has seriously undermined Kim's presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the son who was arrested, 39-year-old Kim Hong Gul,
had been sent to graduate school in the United States when his father
became president to keep him out of this kind of trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "His parents advised him not to go into business while his father
was president," said a family associate who asked not to be
identified. "They knew that in Korea, the relatives of presidents
always get caught in a scandal, and they thought it safest for him to
stay in school in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with the plan, Kim Hong Gul received a master's degree
in international relations at USC and then went to work as a
researcher at Pomona College. But people began to question how a
graduate student could afford a $950,000 house in Rancho Palos Verdes
and frequent first-class trips back to South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   The authorities allege that the explanation lies with Choi Kyu
Sun, a lobbyist with a knack for getting his picture taken with
famous people.</TE>
<TE>   Parlaying connections with the Korean government, Choi tried to
interest such notables as global financier George Soros and singer
Michael Jackson in various Korea ventures, without success. According
to prosecutors, Choi thought that the youngest Kim could help his
business, and he gave him stock options and bags stuffed with cash,
much of it allegedly from a company seeking a contract for the Korean
sports lottery.</TE>
<TE>   "I had great expectations for Kim Dae Jung. He was firm in
promising that he would manage his friends and family well, but he
has failed to keep that promise," said Oh Kye Hyun of the Citizens'
Coalition for Economic Justice, a nonprofit group that advocates
political reform.</TE>
<TE>   The family friend agrees, saying, "It looks like this kind of
scandal is taking away the will and energy for the peace process.
Even though he can finish his term, I doubt he can really accomplish
anything in this last year."</TE>
<TE>   Even before the latest scandal, Kim's popularity had been skidding
from the high it reached around the time of his June 2000 visit to
Pyongyang, the North's capital.</TE>
<TE>   Although the trip earned Kim a reputation as the "Nelson Mandela
of Korea," many South Koreans believed that their country was
groveling before North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, who refused to
reciprocate with a return visit or even to express gratitude for
Seoul's financial assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Kim gets better marks for his handling of the economy.
When he took office in early 1998, South Korea had just turned to the
International Monetary Fund for a multibillion-dollar bailout. The
loan was repaid last summer--nearly three years ahead of
schedule--winning Kim kudos from the business community, which had
been worried about his leftist reputation at the time he took office.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, throughout his presidency, Kim has been more popular from
the outside than on the inside. Like those of fellow Nobel laureates
who also made the transition from dissident to president, Lech Walesa
of Poland and the Czech Republic's Vaclav Havel, Kim's image
internationally is as an icon of democracy, while his own people see
him as an all-too-fallible politician.</TE>
<TE>   "This story of a political prisoner who later wins the Nobel Peace
Prize resonates with Americans. It plays better in America than
Korea," said Victor Cha, a Korea expert at Georgetown University. Cha
noted that even when Kim won the prize in 2000, many Koreans remained
unimpressed.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the most important international accomplishment of any
Korean," Cha said, "and yet there has been tangible ambivalence in
Korea about it."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the political crises of the day, most outsiders believe
that history will look kindly on Kim Dae Jung's legacy. Even the
president's critics acknowledge that the prevalence of financial
scandals in nearly every Korean presidency means that there might be
something wrong with the system rather than with the people.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to comment on the arrest of Kim's son, opposition leader Lee
Hoi Chang, himself a presidential candidate, declined to criticize
the president.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a tragedy of Korean politics that these deplorable
happenings repeat themselves.... We must find a solution to establish
this country in an upright manner and to give stability to the
people," Lee told a forum of South Korean journalists.</TE>
<TE>   Of South Korea's eight presidents, two were arrested after their
terms in office, one was exiled to Hawaii and another was
assassinated. Only Kim's immediate predecessor left office
peacefully, albeit on the heels of his son's arrest on corruption
charges.</TE>
<TE>   "South Koreans are extremely hard on the people they elect as
president," Donald P. Gregg, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea,
wrote in a column last month for the English-language Korea Times.
Kim has "created by his personal diplomacy, the best set of relations
Korea has ever enjoyed with Japan, Russia and China. He has directed
the economic recovery.... All these achievements have seemingly been
forgotten by Koreans."</TE>

<HD>Once Unthinkable, Now Unsinkable</HD>
<DH>The Taliban banned movies, but that didn't stop
Afghanistan's love affair with 'Titanic'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>It towered, a fantastical construction of orange-scented cake and
butter cream icing created by a team of four men, including an
engineer: a 132-pound dessert in the shape of a ship, dedicated to
Afghanistan's favorite film, "Titanic."</LD>
<LD>   Although the Taliban had banned films and shut down cinemas when
the movie was released in 1997, most people here in the capital
watched pirated copies at home on their illegal VCRs.</LD>
<LD>   Here, the movie is still the greatest romantic adventure of all,
so the unhappy ending notwithstanding, the Titanic makes the perfect
wedding cake.</LD>
<TE>   Baker Ghulam Rasul, 63, nearly stumbled under the weight of the
cake as he loaded it into a van on its way to be cut up, served and
eaten--four days' work demolished in one hectic hour.</TE>
<TE>   The madness for things "Titanic" in Kabul dwarfs even the fuss
made over the film in the West.</TE>
<TE>   Kabul sign-writers are practiced exponents of the "Titanic" theme,
with pictures of the ship decorating cake shops, taxis, buses,
trucks, market carts and cafes all over the city.</TE>
<TE>   In the windows of the city's many poster and video shops hang
posters of the movie's stars, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio,
locked in a loving embrace, gazing deeply into each other's eyes.</TE>
<TE>   DiCaprio-style hairstyles featuring long bangs and known as
Titanics--which were banned in the Taliban era because they
interfered with praying--are still popular with Kabul's youth.</TE>
<TE>   The bazaars are full of Titanic shampoo, Titanic perfumes, Titanic
vests, belts, shoes, pants and chewing gum.</TE>
<TE>   Souvenir shops sell Titanic mosaics with the ship laid out in
lapis lazuli.</TE>
<TE>   Cabdriver Abdul Hadi Charkhi, 30, adorned his taxi with a picture
of the ship to attract customers.</TE>
<TE>   "I did it out of love for the film," he said. "There are many,
many taxis with the Titanic."</TE>
<TE>   Young women buy cheap postcards of the "Titanic" stars, printed in
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone likes the name. Everyone says Titanic, Titanic,
Titanic," said Haji Faiz Mohammed, one of Kabul's largest cinema
owners. "Those who have watched it say Titanic, Titanic, Titanic.
Those who have not watched it say Titanic, Titanic, Titanic. It has a
huge name."</TE>
<TE>   The film is popular in video stores, although nearly everyone, it
seems, has seen it, often several times. Yet "Titanic" has never been
shown on the big screen in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Even Afghans have difficulty explaining why, in a landlocked
country, the film so captured the popular imagination.</TE>
<TE>   Siddiq Barmak, the director of state-owned Afghan Film, puts it
best: "'Titanic' is a great human interest story. People here compare
their fate to the story of the Titanic.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a ship which sails out and the passengers have a common
grief which embraces all their lives. And the people on the ship want
to save themselves from their misfortune.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is a lot in common with the fate of Afghanistan and
the Titanic. We're looking for a way to rescue ourselves," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, under the Taliban, the "Titanic" cult was even more
crazed than it is today, locals say--a source of frustration for the
Taliban's Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of
Vice.</TE>
<TE>   Images of the ship were allowed, but pictures of the stars were
banned because human portraits were forbidden.</TE>
<TE>   But the Taliban's efforts to rein in the "Titanic" cult only
illustrated how difficult it was to enforce the regime's rigid social
controls. Many of those who did not have video players saw the film
at the homes of friends who did.</TE>
<TE>   Kabul sign-writer Afizallah, 45, said the Taliban mullahs preached
that people shouldn't watch the film, which features some scenes that
are highly controversial in Afghanistan because of nudity.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd tell people not to do it, and they would do it anyway,"
said Afizallah, who has seen the movie many times.</TE>
<TE>   Although the population secretly flouted the law against videos,
it was risky to openly defy the Virtue and Vice police.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-two Afghan barbers were jailed in January last year for
styling young men with Titanic haircuts.</TE>
<TE>   Rasul, the baker, had a Titanic cake model in pride of place in
his window until the Taliban banned the cake last summer. Members of
the religious police ordered him to remove the model and stop baking
the cake.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Taliban fell here in November, Rasul has resurrected his
proudest creation.</TE>
<TE>   "The Titanic is the most popular cake," Rasul said. "I get a lot
of orders. When the film came to Afghanistan, everyone was interested
in Titanic cakes. It's the best film."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest Titanic cakes he has made weighed 220 pounds. He had
two such orders last year. A 220-pound cake, 2 yards long and 18
inches high, will feed 2,500 hungry wedding guests when sliced by
Rasul's experienced cake cutters.</TE>
<TE>   Rasul's son, Ghulam Reza, 38, works as an engineer in the Ministry
of Planning but put his skills to work in structuring the cake
design.</TE>
<TE>   "No one else is able to make this cake. I'm the only one who can
do it," Rasul boasted, although other Kabul bakers claim that they
could do it if they tried.</TE>
<TE>   Kabul had 40 cinemas before the Soviet invasion in 1979, and 17
under the Soviet-backed Communist leader Najibullah, who ruled from
1986 to 1992.</TE>
<TE>   No new film has been imported to Afghanistan for a decade, and the
cinemas show old, familiar ones.</TE>
<TE>   "'Titanic' would have a big audience because it's new in the
cinema," said Mohammed, the cinema owner, estimating that half of
Kabul's population has yet to see the film.</TE>
<TE>   "They've heard of it and are filled with anticipation. If Afghan
Film gives me permission to import the film, I'll do it," he said,
adding that the film would also have to be approved by the
Afghanistan Censorship Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Barmak, the head of Afghan Film, said the real problem is money:
The film would cost an importer $150,000. But he said Afghan Film
would approve its import, and he is optimistic that the film will be
on the big screen in Kabul soon.</TE>

<HD>Art of Fund-Raising Will Be Tested in Cultural Building
Boom</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS and MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brother, can you spare a billion dollars? That's the tab,
conservatively calculated, if you add up fund-raising campaigns among
cultural institutions seeking bigger and better buildings in Los
Angeles and Orange counties.</LD>
<LD>   It's enough money to build the Getty Center all over again. But
instead of relying on the bequest of a single oil magnate, these
drives will be seeking dollars a harder way: one rich donor at a
time.</LD>
<LD>   The region's pockets are deep enough, say veteran philanthropists
and arts officials. But several also said they don't expect every
campaign to meet its targets--because when the stakes are this high,
will and skill among the fund-raisers matter almost as much as wealth
among donors.</LD>
<TE>   The underlying challenge here "isn't about money. It's about
leadership," said Jack Shakely, president of the California Community
Foundation, one of the state's leading philanthropic organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Even if all major campaigns do reach their goals, some arts
leaders add, they fear a struggle that could squeeze smaller
institutions out as donors ally themselves with the largest, sexiest
buildings. And yet another peril could arise after the big buildings
are finished, when organizations confront higher day-to-day operating
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   But the larger picture is positive, arts leaders and fund-raisers
say. They suggest that Southern California has become so wealthy and
culturally rich that the current menu of projects is a reasonable
response to the resources and demand at hand. In fact, the most
optimistic observers say the rising ambitions of so many institutions
may signal a moment of arrival for the region.</TE>
<TE>   "It is staggering when you add it all up. But there's a kind of a
cumulative energy that comes from people feeling good about the city
maturing and advancing. It's kind of contagious," said Claire Peeps,
executive director of the Santa Monica-based Durfee Foundation and a
veteran administrator of arts organizations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The last time the region had so many high-profile cultural
projects in the works was probably four decades ago, when the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art, the Music Center of Los Angeles County
and the Pasadena Art Museum (now the Norton Simon Museum) went up
between 1964 and 1968, each on land provided by a government agency.
The combined private fund-raising for those projects, corrected for
inflation, comes to roughly $300 million--less than a third of the
target in the scramble for cash that's about to begin.</TE>
<TE>   LACMA and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles in Exposition
Park are the largest players, each preparing to seek $200 million to
$300 million. In LACMA's case, some of the money will go to its
endowment.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Performing Arts Center's push for a new concert
hall is not quite halfway to its goal of $200 million. The Art Center
College of Design in Pasadena and the Children's Museum of Los
Angeles will be seeking more than $100 million each, and projects at
the UCLA Hammer Museum in Westwood, the Petersen Automotive Museum
across Wilshire Boulevard from LACMA, the Skirball Cultural Center in
Brentwood and the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach add up
to another $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown L.A.'s Walt Disney Concert Hall, meanwhile, remains $20
million to $25 million short of its $275-million target. And finally,
several other campaigns with targets under $25 million are running or
soon to start. All this comes on the heels of the Archdiocese of Los
Angeles having raised millions for the new downtown cathedral and
various area universities regularly raising capital funds.</TE>
<TE>   Though some of these efforts have been public for months or
longer, most are still in the silent phase--that spell, often as long
as a year, when fund-raisers quietly tap board members and longtime
boosters. Thus, under the fund-raisers' traditional rule of
thumb--never kick off a public campaign until you've privately raised
half the money--officials at those institutions aren't talking about
what they've secured so far.</TE>
<TE>   At LACMA and the Museum of Natural History, officials say they may
not make their campaigns public for another year or more. The public
phases each will probably last several years, running parallel with
construction work.</TE>
<TE>   Government grants, which help most nonprofit cultural groups meet
operating costs, aren't expected to play a big part in the campaigns
now unfolding, because government agencies don't typically contribute
cash to the bricks-and-mortar expansions of cultural agencies.
However, LACMA and the Museum of Natural History, both affiliated
with the county of Los Angeles, have used county money in assembling
their plans for renovation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To build a museum or a concert hall, said the California Community
Foundation's Shakely, a close observer of the state's philanthropical
landscape for more than two decades, "you get about half of your
money from about 5% of the people. Old money. People who are so
wealthy, they're sort of writing their moral biographies."</TE>
<TE>   The wealth here, all sides agree, extends far beyond such usual
suspects as real estate mogul Eli Broad, who has hinted that he'll
kick in at least $25 million to LACMA's reconstruction; entertainment
executive David Geffen, who in May gave $200 million to UCLA's
medical school and whose past gifts include $5 million each to the
Museum of Contemporary Art's facility in Little Tokyo and the former
Westwood Playhouse (both of which now carry Geffen's name); and Costa
Mesa shopping mall magnate Henry T. Segerstrom, who has given $40
million to the OCPAC campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Other more recently arrived names include high-tech executive Paul
Folino, who joined South Coast Repertory's board in 1996, gave $10
million to its largely complete $50-million campaign for new
facilities and in April agreed to take over as chairman of OCPAC's
board.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, California harbors 92 of the most recent Forbes 400. In
its annual issue on the wealthiest Angelenos, the Los Angeles
Business Journal estimated that L.A. County was home to 25
billionaires in 2001, up from eight in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Foundations, which nationwide donate about $1 for every $7 donated
by wealthy individuals and families, are ripe as well. A recent study
by USC's Center of Philanthropy and Public Policy found that, between
1978 and 1998, the assets of California-based foundations grew from
$2.8 billion to nearly $53 billion. Corporations are a third, smaller
component of these campaigns, and fund-raisers say their share will
be smaller still in the wake of the stock market's troubles in the
last two years.</TE>
<TE>   As the economy has slowed over the last two years, said James
Ferris, director of the USC center, charitable giving may have lost
the momentum it had in the 1990s, but it nevertheless increased.</TE>
<TE>   Ferris also argues--in contradiction to conventional wisdom--that
competition for donor dollars won't be ferocious. Many fund-raisers
quietly worried that the nation's $2 billion in contributions to
post-Sept. 11 recovery campaigns amounts could skew charity
efforts--but that amount, Ferris noted, amounts to just 1% of what
Americans give in a typical year.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Ferris said, this region's cultural groups don't have
much overlap among their supporters. Laura Zucker, executive director
of the Los Angeles County Arts Commission, makes the same argument,
and points to the Big List.</TE>
<TE>   The list was a research project undertaken in 2000 by Arts for
L.A., a coalition of county arts leaders who persuaded 100 arts
organizations of various sizes to merge and compare their mailing
lists. When researchers looked at the resulting master list--about
850,000 households, once duplications were purged--they were
startled. About 70% of the households had been named on just one
list.</TE>
<TE>   "That was mind-boggling," Zucker said. "It just flew in the face
of conventional wisdom, that there are just a few people who go to
everything."</TE>
<TE>   The same is true, Zucker said, when it comes to those few patrons
who sit on boards and make big donations. Together, for instance, the
Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art
have more than 100 board members, and just two in common. In short,
Zucker said, "we're less in competition with each other than we
think."</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say, however, that asking for money is an easy job.
Turnover is often high among development directors, who play a
crucial role in capital campaigns. LACMA's top staff fund-raiser,
vice president for development Katharine DeShaw, resigned in May
after three years on the job. The Children's Museum's top volunteer
fund-raiser, Doug Ring, recently stepped back from his position as
well. Both museums say they're reevaluating their structure before
making a next move.</TE>
<TE>   So what makes a rich man or woman write a big check? Former L.A.
Mayor Richard Riordan, who partnered with Broad to lead fund-raising
for Walt Disney Concert Hall in the mid-1990s--and contributed $5
million of his own--offers this counsel to anybody courting a big
donor: Ask for advice and money, and then listen, and parlay that
into deeper involvement. Then ask for more money.</TE>
<TE>   "Why did I give $5 million? The more responsibility you feel for
making something happen, the more money you give," Riordan said. "And
the person who's most likely to give you money today is the person
who gave you money yesterday."</TE>
<TE>   But it's not enough just to extract money from those donors. It
needs to be extracted and announced according to a strict timetable.
When courting big donors, "the worst thing that can happen is you ask
too early," said Dyan Sublett of the Natural History Museum. "The
more information you can put on the table, the more solid the project
feels, the more you can excite someone. You don't get a second
chance."</TE>
<TE>   The seesaw history of the Disney Hall campaign, now in its 15th
year, "has made our high-level donors more cautious. They don't want
a project out there in the public eye and then have it stall,"
Sublett said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Disney Hall stands as the region's most visible cultural
construction project--and perhaps its most cautionary tale, as well.
It began 15 years ago with a $50-million gift from Lillian Disney.
Architect Frank Gehry was soon retained. As time passed, the budget
began its upward creep, and at groundbreaking in 1992, the estimated
cost was $110 million.</TE>
<TE>   By 1995, cost estimates had escalated further, design disputes had
broken out, and fund-raising had dried up. The project was revived in
the late 1990s, as California's economy again raced forward, the
stock market hit historic highs, and Riordan joined Broad in pushing
local moguls for big gifts.</TE>
<TE>   Now the construction and the fund-raising appear to be in their
home stretches. The Music Center's top executive, Andrea Van de Kamp,
estimates that the campaign has raised $252 million in all.</TE>
<TE>   After pausing for several months following Sept. 11, Van de Kamp
said, fund-raisers are hoping to finish their work about the time the
building's construction crews finish theirs, in fall 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Given all the other campaigns in the offing, Van de Kamp said,
"I'm glad I'm almost done. But there is never a good time to raise
money."</TE>

<TE>   Capital Arts Campaigns</TE>
<TE>   Among the largest projects in the works:</TE>
<TE>   * Trustees of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art expect to start
a campaign in 2002 or 2003 for roughly $300 million toward
construction of a new complex.</TE>
<TE>   * The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County plans to
renovate and expand at an estimated cost of $200 million to $300
million.</TE>
<TE>   * The Art Center College of Design in Pasadena plans additions to
its site and an expansion onto a former power plant site. Costs are
estimated at well beyond $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   * The Children's Museum of Los Angeles says it will soon announce
a capital campaign to raise $102 million for two buildings and $10
million in endowment funds. The city of Los Angeles has advanced $1
million.</TE>
<TE>   * The Orange County Performing Arts Center is about halfway to its
goal of raising $200 million for a new symphony hall and a
multipurpose theater. Officials expect to open the symphony hall in
fall 2005.</TE>
<TE>   * South Coast Repertory launched a campaign in 1998 that recently
reached its original goal of $40 million, more than a year ahead of
schedule. Theater leaders decided to set a higher goal of $50 million
by the end of 2003. A new theater is under construction, along with
the renovation of two stages.</TE>
<TE>   * The UCLA Hammer Museum began a $25-million drive two years ago
for renovation and expansion. Fund-raising has passed the halfway
mark.</TE>
<TE>   * The Petersen Automotive Museum expects to open a campaign of $25
million to $30 million later this year for a redesign and expansion
that will add a banquet hall and a restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   * The Skirball Cultural Center is in the middle of a $35-million
campaign to add an amphitheater and exhibition space, including
several children's facilities.</TE>
<TE>   * The Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach has kicked off a
$15-million campaign to renovate and expand its space, including a
$5-million addition to its endowment.</TE>
<TE>   * The Walt Disney Concert Hall, being built at the Music Center in
Los Angeles, aims for completion in September 2003. Executives say
the campaign has raised $252 million, with $20 million to $25 million
to go.</TE>

<HD>Ordination Is Symbol of Faith--and Change</HD>
<DH>Catholicism: Carmelite's rigorous training reflects the
order's effort to develop healthy priests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the humble stucco church of St. Raphael in South-Central Los
Angeles, a bishop laid his hands on Paul Henson's head in an ancient
ritual complete with sacred oil, promises of obedience and prayers of
consecration.</LD>
<LD>   With that, Henson became both a priest and a symbol Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   His journey represented a joyful affirmation of faith to a
scandal-plagued Roman Catholic Church, new vitality to an aging
priesthood and pride to his fellow Latinos, who constitute 70% of the
Los Angeles Archdiocese's 5 million Catholics.</LD>
<TE>   It also offered a glimpse into the radical changes that his
Carmelite religious order has made to produce a healthy
priest--changes with implications for Catholic leaders struggling to
respond to mounting cases of priestly abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The worldwide Carmelite order, founded nearly eight centuries ago
in Israel, was one of the earliest religious organizations to require
rigorous psychological screening and regular therapy during the
order's intense, seven-year formation process.</TE>
<TE>   Many Catholics hope the nation's bishops will call for similar
features throughout the American church when they meet in Dallas
later this month to discuss solutions to the sex abuse scandal.</TE>
<TE>   The weight of his ordination was not lost on Henson, a 38-year-old
Los Angeles native and second-generation Mexican American who will
celebrate his first Mass at St. Raphael today.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting ordained at one of the worst times, one of the most
doubtful times, when the church looks so awful," he acknowledged over
beef burritos last week. But, he said, "I love the church. I love the
fact that our church is an instrument of God's love and caring for
people, and I desire to be part of it."</TE>
<TE>   The ordination featured solemn rituals and lively folk music from
the church youth choir. The bilingual ceremony, with gospel
spirituals and mariachi music, reflected St. Raphael's African
American and Latino mixture.</TE>
<TE>   In the ordination's high point, Henson prostrated himself on the
floor, then rose--symbolizing the death of his former life and
rebirth into a new priestly service. Then he put on his gold and
cream vestments and received his chalice and paten as the
congregation applauded.</TE>
<TE>   Henson presents himself not as an icon of saintliness but as a
fully fallible man. He worries about his worthiness for ministry, the
suitability of his skills, his ability to remain faithful to his vows
of poverty, chastity and obedience.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike earlier generations of priests who began training in
hermetically sealed seminaries, sometimes as teenagers--and who in
some cases failed to develop the necessary emotional maturity--Henson
came to his priestly call with rich life experiences.</TE>
<TE>   Raised in Pico Rivera, the trim man with lively eyes and a
gregarious manner lost his mother to drugs at age 1 and never met his
father until three years ago. He was raised by his great-aunt, a
devout Catholic who roused him at 6 a.m. for daily Mass and compelled
him to sit, squirming, through nightly recitations of the Rosary
before a statue of Our Lady of Fatima.</TE>
<TE>   He was a mischievous boy who dumped his dog's droppings in the
neighbor's yard but was always, Henson says, respectful of his
religion. The priests who surrounded him from boyhood were nothing
but a positive presence.</TE>
<TE>   There was Father Madrigal at his hometown church of St. Mariana de
Paredes, who invited him along on sick calls to homes and hospitals;
there were the trips to Disneyland and Big Sur with other priests
throughout his life. Never did anyone ever do anything inappropriate,
he says.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the two recruiters from the local high school seminary
who turned his head when he was in elementary school. Sharp in their
black pants and blazers, the priests inspired Henson, who recalls
thinking: "I want to be just like them."</TE>
<TE>   It would be nearly 15 years, however, before he finally entered
the Carmelite order in 1995 at 30. In between, he earned an
undergraduate degree in philosophy at the Los Angeles Archdiocese's
St. John's Seminary in Camarillo, then fell in love with a woman and
moved away from religion.</TE>
<TE>   He seemed headed to fulfill his dreams of a married life--he a
teacher, she a photographer--with beautiful children, a two-car
garage and a sprawling ranch reminiscent of the rural Mexican village
life that his great-aunt frequently spoke about.</TE>
<TE>   Henson partied with friends, drinking beer and hanging out. He
vacationed in Acapulco and Puerto Vallarta. He launched a career as
an elementary and high school teacher.</TE>
<TE>   But the call to priesthood, he says, continued to creep into his
mind, sometimes stealthily at night while he lay in bed or during
daytime walks. Never a thunderous bolt from the heavens, the thought
would tickle him, softly but persistently. Priesthood. He says the
word would just pop into his head.</TE>
<TE>   After his romantic relationship fell apart, Henson decided he
needed to explore the summons.</TE>
<TE>   "I did everything possible for this to die out and it just never
did," he said. "I can see why they call it a call from God."</TE>
<TE>   To enter the Carmelite seminary, Henson underwent a rigorous
screening involving letters of recommendation, three interviews and
psychological tests--a process that results in the majority of
applicants being rejected today, according to Father Tracy
O'Sullivan, who headed the Carmelite seminary in Washington, D.C.,
from 1990 to 1994, when he was transferred to St. Raphael.</TE>
<TE>   Some candidates also are screened out midway through the seminary
training process; O'Sullivan says he refused to allow some men to
proceed to full ordination after spotting "a weirdness of interest"
in the way they behaved with other people--sometimes with children.</TE>
<TE>   That selectivity contrasts sharply with O'Sullivan's own
experience. The white-haired priest, who recently celebrated his 40th
anniversary of service, says he merely submitted a letter of
recommendation from his pastor. Being a high school football star, he
was shooed in. "They were so happy I was going they didn't ask me
anything," O'Sullivan recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The stricter admission process represents just one change that the
Carmelites began making three decades ago. That's when, in the words
of O'Sullivan, the seminary had to shift from "an 18th century
program to 1960s USA." As the order lost scores of priests and nuns
to the sexual and political liberation movements of the times, the
seminary began opening up.</TE>
<TE>   During his time, O'Sullivan said, seminarians were not allowed to
read newspapers, socialize in the outside world or regularly watch
television. Priests were abruptly moved from that insular environment
to parish ministry, often resulting in major adjustment problems.</TE>
<TE>   Until the mid-1950s, psychology was shunned as a "threat to the
church," he said--especially Freudian ideas of sexual freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Today, however, Henson said his priestly formation process
included regular therapy to hash out painful childhood experiences,
such as feelings of abandonment by his parents.</TE>
<TE>   The training included group meetings with his fellow Carmelite
brothers about building healthy relationships. There, Henson and
others would vent whatever needed airing: why grown men in their 30s
were still sometimes treated like children by seminary leaders. How
to wrestle with ideas of authority and obedience. How to honestly
express feelings.</TE>
<TE>   And, Henson said, there were plenty of sessions on sexuality--the
most difficult aspect, he added, of seminary life. A candid speaker,
Henson said he often discussed everything from how to deal with
sexual urges to whether affectionate feelings for the brothers would
eventually turn him gay.</TE>
<TE>   Through his training, Henson said, he has learned to be acutely
aware of his urges and rechannel them in healthy directions. While at
the seminary, he said, he "adopted" a Mexican American family and saw
them a few times a week--cuddling the baby girl, dancing with the
wife and downing beers with the husband to fulfill his need for
intimacy and affection.</TE>
<TE>   As the sex scandals began breaking earlier this year, his friends
sat him down and gave him stern, loving warnings: "If I ever hear of
you getting involved in any inappropriate touching," Henson said the
wife, Lupe, told him, "I'm going to cut off your hands and certain
other things off too."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Carmelites' counseling and therapy programs were
instituted by Father Quinn Connors, a nationally renowned clinical
psychologist who led priestly workshops on "healthy boundaries" in
Los Angeles this year and will serve as consultant to the nation's
bishops at their Dallas meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Though no study on the programs has been conducted, O'Sullivan
said they seem to have helped reduce the number of problem priests.
He said virtually all of the Carmelite cases of sexual abuse have
involved older men and offenses committed decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   In March, the Carmelite order ousted the Rev. Dominic Savino, 63,
as president of Crespi Carmelite High School in Encino over
allegations that he sexually abused students more than two decades
ago.</TE>
<TE>   In another key element of the Carmelite program, would-be priests
are required to spend two years as interns in a local ministry,
rather than being abruptly plopped into parishes straight from the
seminary. Henson served in Peru and rural northern Mexico, an
experience he said solidified his commitment to the priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   Once, he said, he testily told a girl who kept missing religion
classes that she could not be confirmed. The pain in her eyes haunted
him the entire summer he was away, he said, until he returned to
Mexico in the fall and apologized.</TE>
<TE>   "I was teary-eyed. I had sinned. I made this girl feel she was not
part of the church," he said. "At that moment, I decided if I'm going
to be a leader I can never again make someone feel so awful about
themselves. Rules are never going to take precedence over another's
desire for grace and sacraments."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Henson said, he hopes to start a high school in
Mexico. For the immediate future, he will complete his master's
degree in education and teach at the Encino Carmelite high school. He
will join 14 other Carmelites in the Los Angeles Archdiocese, who
make up a small fraction of the area's 1,200 priests.</TE>
<TE>   As one of about 400 Latino priests in the archdiocese, Henson "is
a sign of the great expectations we have in the U.S. Catholic church
that Hispanics, recently arrived and many generations present, will
assume their rightful place" of leadership, said Father Vicente Lopez
of St. Raphael. Lopez said Henson is one of relatively few
American-born Latino priests.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a statement," O'Sullivan said, "that there is new life in
the church."</TE>

<HD>Bush Issues Call to Action</HD>
<DH>Policy: The president, speaking at West Point's graduation,
says the nation must preempt terrorist threats and stand up to
evil-doers anywhere in the world.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST POINT, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>President Bush said Saturday that America must take "preemptive
action" against the worst terrorist threats "before they emerge" and
must confront evil-doers "in any dark corner of the world."</LD>
<LD>   "If we wait for threats to fully materialize, we will have waited
too long," Bush said in a tough, uncompromising address to the 204th
graduating class of the U.S. Military Academy.</LD>
<LD>   The president's vow to maintain an aggressive posture was
particularly pointed, coming on the heels of a weeklong European tour
that revealed a continuing undercurrent of concern among the allies
about the war on terrorism, especially the administration's
determination to confront Iraq and other countries that seek weapons
of mass destruction and have histories of involvement with terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   Bush's remarks also came at a time when attention is riveted on
the growing body of evidence that the nation's intelligence and law
enforcement communities may have missed the significance of clues to
an impending terrorist attack before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The president held his ground Saturday, arguing that the new enemy
in the world demands "new thinking."</TE>
<TE>   "We face a threat with no precedent," Bush said, describing the
Sept. 11 hijackers as "a few dozen evil and deluded men" whose
suicidal missions had been financed by only "a few hundred thousand
dollars ... much less than the cost of a single tank."</TE>
<TE>   Against such enemies, he said, the Cold War strategy of deterrence
and containment "means nothing."</TE>
<TE>   "Containment is not possible when unbalanced dictators with
weapons of mass destruction can deliver those weapons on missiles or
secretly provide them to terrorist allies," Bush said in a
unmistakable reference to Iraq and North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "In the world we have entered, the only path to safety is the path
of action," he said. "And this nation will act."</TE>
<TE>   Since active hostilities have slowed on the ground in Afghanistan,
the Bush administration has struggled to take its war on terrorism to
the next level. In January, the president sought to expand the battle
by labeling Iraq, Iran and North Korea as an "axis of evil" and
suggesting that the war could soon spread to such countries,
particularly Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. allies, which have been essential to the international effort
to rout out Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization, have
increasingly criticized Bush's unilateralist tendencies. Thousands of
antiwar demonstrators flooded the streets of Berlin last week to
protest U.S. policies during Bush's visit. While German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder pledged solidarity in the fight against terrorism,
objections to spreading the battle to Iraq extend to the highest
political levels there and in other European nations.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech, Bush expressed his determination to act decisively
and speak forthrightly--even if that were to offend the sensibilities
of America's allies.</TE>
<TE>   "Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak
the language of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances
require different methods--but not different moralities ....By
confronting evil and lawless regimes, we do not create a problem. We
reveal a problem. And we will lead the world in opposing it."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to reaffirming his determination to confront
terrorists around the world, Bush's comments also served as a
justification for the far-reaching policies his administration
announced last week, expanding the abilities of domestic intelligence
gathering, especially by the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Bush told the cadets that they must be "ready to strike at a
moment's notice in any dark corner of the world."</TE>
<TE>   But even as he warned of a long campaign filled with grave dangers
and complex choices, Bush displayed his trademark optimism,
predicting that one day "we will lift this dark threat from our
country and from the world."</TE>
<TE>   Before addressing the 958 graduating West Point cadets in a
football stadium packed with tens of thousands of their friends and
family members, Bush took a few minutes to telephone participants in
the annual Race for the Cure, a breast cancer fund-raising event in
downtown Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bush spoke from a private office, his remarks were piped
into a nearby press center so that traveling reporters could hear
them--a standard arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   But as Bush was wrapping up his brief remarks, a White House
communications technician interrupted, informing him that the
telephone connection had proved faulty and his words had not been
heard in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you talking about? They dropped the call? You mean, I
haven't, they haven't heard a word yet?" Bush demanded.</TE>
<TE>   "God dang-it," he snapped.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Bush's congratulatory
remarks were rebroadcast, but the runners in Washington did not hear
them then either because of technical problems with the race's public
address system.</TE>

<HD>Criticism Greets FBI Overhaul</HD>
<DH>Intelligence: While some argue the bureau should be reined
in, Ashcroft says expanding its scope will offset 'competitive
advantage' of terrorists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For a once-vaunted agency that brought down John Dillinger and nabbed
the Lindbergh baby kidnapper, the last few years have been brutal
ones at the FBI.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's premier police force has been hit with one
embarrassing headline after another: its bungled probe of nuclear
scientist Wen Ho Lee, its failure to catch in-house spy Robert Philip
Hanssen, its mishandling of the Oklahoma City bombing documents, its
coddling of Boston mobsters and, most recently, its inability to
piece together pre-Sept. 11 warnings.</LD>
<LD>   Rein in the FBI, many critics on Capitol Hill have demanded. But
in a supreme bit of Washington-style irony, the Bush administration
is now doing just the opposite by expanding the FBI's scope and power
to heights unseen since the days of former Director J. Edgar Hoover.</LD>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft says that beefing up the FBI--giving
field agents new powers to monitor suspects, hiring 900 more agents,
adding $700 million to the budget and centralizing oversight in
Washington--will take away the "competitive advantage" of terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Critics, however, liken the FBI to a troubled teenager who has
gotten into a string of mishaps only to have his parents send him out
on the town with the keys to the car and a wad of spending money.</TE>
<TE>   "The government is rewarding failure at the FBI," said Gregory
Nojeim, associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
national office, which attacked the order Ashcroft approved Thursday
giving FBI agents new authority to monitor the Internet, mosques,
rallies and other once-restricted areas in search of possible
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "The notion that the answer to the FBI's failure to connect the
dots [before Sept. 11] ought to be rewarding the agency with more
power to collect more information without any evidence--to me, that
just seems wrongheaded," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft's plan to empower the bureau has earned some support in
the last few days, particularly from agents, who say the new
guidelines finally will give them the tools to track terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   But the naysayers clearly have outshouted the supporters so far in
the debate, and the Bush administration is facing harsh criticism
from all sides--from civil libertarians on the left to conservatives
on the right--over the future of the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Wall Street Journal's editorial page, often a
bellwether of conservative opinion, Friday called for FBI Director
Robert S. Mueller III's resignation. The Journal, which opposed
Mueller's nomination last fall, said that, "without leadership and
credibility at the top, no amount of bureaucratic reshuffling will
make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft, however, says he has not wavered in his support for the
former San Francisco prosecutor, and the attorney general's push to
strengthen the FBI appears to be based at least in part on his strong
personal confidence in Mueller.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft made Mueller his acting deputy after he took over at the
Justice Department last year. He then lobbied aggressively for
President Bush to tap Mueller for the FBI post last summer. And he
sang his praises so effusively last week at a news
conference--recapping Mueller's long resume and military career and
saying he was "the right man for the job" of reorganizing the
FBI--that Mueller later said he was embarrassed.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure on Mueller is likely to intensify this week, as he is
scheduled to testify at a Senate hearing regarding Sept. 11. A
government source who asked not to be identified said that Coleen
Rowley, the Minneapolis agent who wrote the scathing letter blasting
the FBI headquarters' handling last summer of suspected "20th
hijacker" Zacarias Moussaoui, also is expected to testify.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.), chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, said he wants Ashcroft and Mueller to appear
before his committee to answer questions about why "regulations on
domestic spying that have worked so well for the last 25 or 26 years
have to be changed."</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that the Justice Department has gone too far,"
Sensenbrenner said Saturday in a CNN interview. "I get very, very
queasy when federal law enforcement is effectively ... going back to
the bad old days when the FBI was spying on people like Martin Luther
King Jr."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), one of the FBI's toughest
critics in Congress, says he sees no immediate push to oust Mueller,
who he believes has taken positive steps to right a troubled agency.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe a year from now I'll say he should have been fired, but I
think with him in office only a week before Sept. 11, and all that's
been dumped on him, it's ill-considered to say he has to go,"
Grassley said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   But, noting that the breakdowns that allowed FBI headquarters to
largely ignore pre-Sept. 11 warnings from Phoenix and Minneapolis,
Grassley said: "I think there's people in the agency that aren't
serving [Mueller] well. He's got to get rid of them."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Grassley said that Congress bears part of the blame for
"rewarding" the FBI with more money--its budget is now $4.2
billion--and more responsibility to investigate an expanded base of
federal crimes over the years, despite its recent history of
missteps.</TE>
<TE>   "The basic problem at the FBI is not that they need more help but
that they need to use the resources they have now," he said. "We have
to change the mind set ... and turn this battleship around."</TE>
<TE>   For better or for worse, the events of Sept. 11 have forced the
FBI to drastically alter its mission. But is the agency up for the
task?</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI has always had to evolve to meet challenges," said
William M. Baker, who was a top official in the bureau until his
retirement in 1991. "But it's never been faced with a challenge, in
my experience, as great as this one.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at war. Yes, there have been failures at the FBI, and
they're clear. But there have also been a ... lot of accomplishments,
and what's critical now for the FBI is to show that it has the
capability to get the job done."</TE>
<TE>   At the revamped FBI, a force of more than 11,000 agents that has
become renowned over the years for chasing down bank robbers,
kidnappers, drug traffickers and white-collar criminals now will make
counter-terrorism its main and overriding mission, Mueller said last
week. About 400 agents who now are investigating narcotics will be
pulled to track down terrorist leads instead.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators who have concentrated primarily on looking into
crimes that already have occurred will be asked to take a more
aggressive approach and anticipate terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   And agents who have been generally prohibited from using hunches
to surf the Internet or stake out mosques in search of terrorists now
will be given free rein to do so--often without reporting to FBI
headquarters in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Portland, Ore., FBI agent Nancy Savage, head of the agents'
association, said Ashcroft's overhaul of bureau guidelines "is one of
the most significant things that they've done" in the war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something that the agents in the street have been screaming
about, saying, 'Hey, let us take the gloves off and do what we have
to do in these investigations,'" she said. "It's been hugely
frustrating. You have to go in [to a supervisor] and say, 'This is
what I have seen. Please, please, Mother may I go into a further
investigative stage?'"</TE>
<TE>   Robert Blitzer, who was head of the FBI's counter-terrorism unit
until 1998, recalled the absurdity of his agents being prohibited
from collecting and filing newspaper articles on terrorism cases.</TE>
<TE>   The restrictions grew out of Hoover-era abuses in the bureau's
monitoring and retention of records on such figures as King and
singer-songwriter John Lennon.</TE>
<TE>   "Those were [bogus] restrictions, and they never should have been
put in place in the first place," Blitzer said. "It really hurt us
from the perspective of being able to do collection and analysis" of
"open source" material that is available publicly.</TE>
<TE>   The changes could be productive. Hate crime experts such as Brian
Levin, head of Cal State San Bernardino's Center on Hate and
Extremism, say that terrorist- related groups have been known to use
the Internet and public meeting places for recruitment and
fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's terrorists take advantage of the public domain, and so
should [the FBI], as long as it's done in the most narrowly tailored
way possible. That's the key--not allowing broad and unending fishing
expeditions that can lead to abuses," Levin said.</TE>
<TE>   But detractors say the FBI's history gives them little reason for
confidence.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Ashcroft's overhaul of law enforcement guidelines,
including a measure to strengthen the use of confidential informants,
came just two days after a former FBI agent in Boston was convicted
of racketeering and obstruction, charges that grew out of his use of
confidential Mafia informants who were linked to as many as 20
murders.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, civil rights advocates say that, while Ashcroft and
Mueller are demanding a more aggressive FBI, it is the
over-aggressive "cowboy" mentality of a select few agents that has
led to some of the bureau's most damaging gaffes in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Among the high-profile episodes, critics point to Lee, the nuclear
scientist at the Los Alamos, N.M., facility who was jailed for nine
months without bail before all but one of 59 counts against him were
dropped in 2000. Also noted are the investigation of Richard Jewell,
identified as a "prime suspect" in the 1996 Olympic park bombing in
Atlanta before he was cleared, and an FBI sharpshooter's fatal 1992
shooting of a survivalist's wife in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and the
alleged cover-up that followed.</TE>
<TE>   Nojeim, the ACLU official, said that an FBI with overreaching
powers is not the answer to terrorism. "Sure, if everyone's
conversations are monitored, certainly something [about possible
terrorists plots] might turn up. But that's not how our criminal
justice system is built to work. That might be how it's done in China
or Cuba, but not here."</TE>
<TE>   But FBI supporters said that, for all the talk about potential
abuses, the agency has to be given the power to fight domestic
terrorism for one simple reason: No other U.S. agency has the
personnel or the resources to do it.</TE>
<TE>   "Who ... else is going to do it?" asked Blitzer, the former FBI
counter-terrorism chief. "The FBI has to be up to the task, and
that's all there is to it."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AYODHYA, India</DL>
<LD>Nearly 10,000 paramilitary troops moved into this northern town
Saturday after police said an Islamic separatist group threatened to
blow up a makeshift Hindu temple at the site of a demolished 16th
century mosque.</LD>
<LD>   Security was tightened as thousands of Hindus began arriving in
Ayodhya, 345 miles east of New Delhi, to hold a prayer ceremony today
close to the ruins of the Babri Masjid mosque razed by Hindu
nationalists nearly 10 years ago. That destruction triggered riots
that killed more than 2,000 people.</LD>
<LD>   Intelligence reports say a Pakistan-based militant group,
Jaish-e-Mohammed, planned to attack the temple, where Hindus keep
idols of their gods and goddesses, a police officer said on condition
of anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   The Pakistan-based group has not made a public statement about
such plans.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of Hindus will participate in today's ceremony,
concluding 108 days of worshipping fire as an expression of resolve
to build a large temple for Lord Rama, an incarnation of the Hindu
god Vishnu, at the disputed site.</TE>
<TE>   Many Hindus believe that Lord Rama was born at the site and that
the mosque was built after the desecration of a temple.</TE>
<TE>   "Each devotee coming to Ayodhya for the ceremony will be
physically checked and will have to pass through metal detectors,"
J.S. Deepak, a top district administrator, said.</TE>
<TE>   "The threat perception is too high keeping in mind the large
congregation of devotees and a disturbed border situation," he said,
referring to tensions building on the India-Pakistan border over
Pakistan's alleged support for militants crossing the border into
India to launch attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The temple campaign in Uttar Pradesh state was blamed for
triggering another round of religious violence in February that
killed nearly 1,000 people in the western state of Gujarat.</TE>

<LD>A relentless foe of President Clinton, a hero to gun owners, a
federal prosecutor under President Reagan, Rep. Bob Barr should be a
shoo-in for reelection this fall in the heavily Republican northern
suburbs of Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   But first he must survive a fight for his political life against a
fellow Republican whose conservative credentials are just about as
strong as his.</LD>
<LD>   Barr, a four-term House member who became nationally known as an
early and forceful advocate of Clinton's impeachment, must face
five-term Rep. John Linder in this year's marquee House Republican
primary.</LD>
<TE>   The reason for this matchup: an aggressive Democratic attempt to
gain as many as four House seats in Georgia by redrawing the state's
congressional district boundaries. Democrats hope their gains in
Georgia will help them recapture the House, which Republicans now
control by a 222-211 margin (plus two independents).</TE>
<TE>   So, on Aug. 20, Republican voters in Georgia's redrawn 7th
District will send either Barr or Linder into unwanted retirement.</TE>
<TE>   It's a tough choice between down-the-line conservatives, though
Barr is far more outspoken and a shade more populist.</TE>
<TE>   As the two foes crisscrossed these suburbs in campaign sport
utility vehicles during last week's congressional recess, Barr sought
to distinguish himself as a conservative who leads.</TE>
<TE>   Well aware that many voters love him or loathe him, Barr predicted
that the GOP partisans who decide the race will conclude: "Hey, this
is a guy who knows what he talks about; he understands the issues;
he's not afraid to take a position. Hey, he's a leader."</TE>
<TE>   Many social conservatives across the country revere Barr as one of
13 House prosecutors in Clinton's 1999 impeachment trial in the
Senate and as a fervent supporter of gun rights. Charlton Heston,
president of the National Rifle Assn., has stumped for him this year.
So has talk radio host Oliver L. North.</TE>
<TE>   But Linder, who rose to high levels in the House when fellow
Georgian Newt Gingrich was speaker, can make a strong case for
himself. He sits on the Rules Committee, which sets the terms of
debate for nearly all major legislation, and could become its
chairman in a few years. "You don't claim leadership," Linder said.
"You earn it."</TE>
<TE>   Should Barr lose, he would be the fifth impeachment manager to
leave Congress. Another manager, Rep. Stephen E. Buyer of Indiana,
defeated Rep. Brian D. Kerns last month in the year's only other
contest between House GOP incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   Although Barr, 53, probably is the better known of the two
incumbents in the district, the 59-year-old Linder holds a slight
geographic edge. He represents about a third of the people who live
in the new district; Barr represents about a fifth. Both candidates
have moved into the district within the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Both claim that their own polls show them leading, and there are
no independent surveys to prove either wrong. Each has banked several
hundred thousand dollars to finance radio, television and direct-mail
advertising, and the campaigns could spend more than $4 million
combined.</TE>
<TE>   Certain that the electorate will be conservative, both candidates
are running hard to the right. Barr touts his A-plus rating from the
NRA, but Linder notes that Heston's group gives him an A.</TE>
<TE>   Linder talks up a proposal to abolish the federal income and
corporate taxes and replace them with a national sales tax. Barr says
he would like to get rid of the IRS too. Linder lionizes Reagan.
Barr, named by Reagan in 1986 to be U.S. attorney for northern
Georgia, calls him "the greatest president of the 20th century." Both
are reliably anti-abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Barr, from his perch on the House Judiciary Committee, has one
crusade that separates him to a degree from Linder and some GOP
leaders: He regularly pushes for civil liberties and voices concerns
about expansion of the government's police powers. In an appearance
before a civic group recently, Barr recited what he called a "law of
the universe": "Once you surrender power to the government, you don't
get it back."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans are gnashing their teeth at the thought of losing one
of these conservative stalwarts. Analysts wonder why it's happening.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that baffles me," said Bill Shipp, editor of a
newsletter about Georgia politics, "is that one of them is going to
destroy the other one. Why are they letting that occur?"</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, GOP strategists, including state party chairman Ralph
Reed and Rep. Thomas M. Davis of Virginia, chairman of the party's
House campaign committee, tried and failed to broker an alternative
to a Barr-Linder race.</TE>
<TE>   Linder claims that Barr could have run in another district to the
west, the newly drawn 11th, which includes much of the territory Barr
now represents. He cited a poll commissioned in October by party
strategists in Washington that showed Barr could win that district.</TE>
<TE>   Barr brushes aside that scenario, arguing that Democrats rigged
the 11th District to make it inhospitable for Republican candidates.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Barr and Linder were attracted to the prospect of
winning the GOP stronghold that the 7th District has become. Whoever
takes the primary can reasonably expect to cruise to reelection for
the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   Races between incumbents of the same party often occur in states
that lose congressional seats. Georgia, by contrast, was one of the
fastest-growing states in the 1990s, and it gained two House seats
with the reapportionment of seats that occurred after the 2000
census.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Democrats, who control the state Legislature and the
governor's office, still managed to redraw congressional district
boundaries to maximize their chances of gaining not only the two new
seats but also two others held by the GOP. Democrats, who hold only
three of the state's 11 congressional seats, could hope to capture
seven of the new 13 seats in November's elections.</TE>
<TE>   The all-out strategy by Democrats stands in contrast to the
redistricting process in California, where the party played it safe
despite controlling the Legislature and the governorship. The
Legislature drew district lines to protect incumbents of both
parties; no incumbent was forced to run against another in a primary
or a general election.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Georgia's 7th District--an arc of fast-growing suburbs
north of Atlanta--many Republican voters appear vexed at being forced
to choose between Barr and Linder. As Barr appeared one morning
before a civic group in Cherokee County, Bob Kuzniak, 58, a retired
pharmacist, said: "I'm torn. I think that a lot of people in this
district are torn. They both have influence up there. Can I vote for
both of them?"</TE>
<TE>   At another event, a homeowners meeting in Forsyth County where
both candidates spoke, Donald Lofe, 74, a retired financial analyst,
said he didn't know how he would decide.</TE>
<TE>   "They're both very capable," he said. "You see the dilemma."</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Only 10 families have completed applications for the federal
government's Sept. 11 fund, nearly nine months after the terrorist
attacks that killed more than 3,000 people, the fund's administrator
said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Kenneth Feinberg, a Georgetown University law professor, said the
applications were made available about eight weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm fairly confident that by the end of next year we'll have a
success rate of over 90%," Feinberg said. "It's just taking more time
than we thought. It's a new process, and people are unsure about how
it will work."</LD>
<TE>   The figure reflects a number of factors, from the complexity of
the process to the possibility of filing lawsuits. Feinberg said four
lawsuits have been filed.</TE>
<TE>   Some people are waiting to see how early applicants fare.
Applicants forfeit all rights to sue the airlines and others.</TE>
<TE>   Feinberg says the minimum award is $250,000 and the average will
be about $1.85 million.</TE>

<HD>Mother, Daughter Hikers Are Found Safe in Colorado</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ENCAMPMENT, Wyo.</DL>
<LD>ENCAMPMENT, Wyo. -- A woman and her daughter missing for five days in
the Rocky Mountains were found, hungry but in otherwise good
condition, Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Norma Super, 45, and her daughter Danielle, 11, of Lakewood,
Colo., got lost on a two-day, 15-mile hike along the Encampment River
in south-central Wyoming.</LD>
<LD>   The two were found four miles south of the Colorado-Wyoming state
line. Authorities said they headed south into Colorado's Mt. Zirkel
Wilderness Area instead of north to a campground in Wyoming, where
their vehicle was parked.</LD>
<TE>   Dozens of people were involved in the search. The two were found
Saturday afternoon by a U.S. Forest Service officer and a volunteer
who were searching on horseback.</TE>
<TE>   The pair had not eaten since Tuesday but were carrying water
filters, which enabled them to drink water found along the trail,
said Carbon County Sheriff Jerry Colson.</TE>
<TE>   The mother and daughter had apparently started their trek walking
north but became turned around on the Encampment River Trail and
wound up southbound, he said. They encountered waist-deep snow and
decided to leave the trail, eventually climbing to the top of Black
Mountain in the wilderness area.</TE>
<TE>   The two were returning north when they were found, Colson said.</TE>
<TE>   Although they were in good condition, an ambulance and doctor were
sent to the scene as a precaution.</TE>

<HD>Giving Life to Tales of Death, but Sticking to Nonfiction</HD>
<DH>Obituaries: At New Mexico meeting, writers discuss a job
once seen as grunt work. It can be intriguing, but to separate fact
and fancy, digging is a must.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS, N.M.</DL>
<LD>They gathered this weekend at a historic hotel said to be graced by a
ghost or three, to discuss the public's fascination with real-life
stories that begin with death and work backward.</LD>
<LD>   Talking among themselves at this unusual workshop, they realized
that they are among the nation's most popular writers, although their
names are not well known.</LD>
<LD>   They write obituaries, not so much of celebrities and other
newsmakers, but of ordinary people who, in death, may help illuminate
life.</LD>
<TE>   The stories trigger laughs and tears and outbursts of anger, and
can end up in scrapbooks or placed inside coffins, like
identification papers for a journey.</TE>
<TE>   The obituaries are treasured too by a public that is titillated by
the life stories of total strangers, enriched by learning how the
deceased touched a town or affected history.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the response they receive from grieving families and
anonymous readers, these obituary writers say they relish a task
that, years ago, was considered entry-level work for journalists
having to pay their dues.</TE>
<TE>   "I've interviewed an awful lot of famous people, including the
Dalai Lama, but I'd rather interview people like the old widower who
told me, 'You never realize how much noise an old woman can make
until she's gone,'" said Jim Sheeler, who scours Colorado's death
announcements weekly and selects one person to highlight in a
1,200-word obituary in the Denver Post.</TE>
<TE>   "It's cathartic for the family to share the person's life with
me," he said. "I feel like a hospice worker, and to be allowed that
intimacy into a life is a privilege."</TE>
<TE>   Sheeler was one of about two dozen writers, funeral directors,
academics and obituary Web site operators who attended the 4th Great
Obituary Writers' National Conference in this high-country town in
northern New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The workshop was founded by Carolyn Gilbert, a government
consultant from Dallas who is fascinated by obituaries.</TE>
<TE>   She organized the group so that writers could meet one another,
share experiences and elevate the craft.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the person who kept my subscription to the hometown newspaper
every time I moved so I could keep track of everyone. The obituaries
become snapshots of the people I've known."</TE>
<TE>   Newspapers regularly charge a fee to publish obituaries written by
family members, and some print free, curt announcements of every
death in their circulation areas.</TE>
<TE>   But a growing number of editors have recognized the popularity of
obituaries and are assigning accomplished feature writers to prepare
them. Some writers tackle the job with flair and style, viewing
today's obituary as "creative nonfiction."</TE>
<TE>   "Richly written obituaries are a journalism art from the 1880s
that have again blossomed," said Nigel Starck, a journalism professor
from the University of South Australia who has researched the history
of obituaries and was the keynote speaker.</TE>
<TE>   "The obituary is the finest form of journalism--it's
investigative, requires accuracy and is written by an absolutely
inquisitive person with a mix of candor and elegance so that it is
rewarding to both the writer and the reader."</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of such stories was proved again by the New York
Times, which was widely lauded for publishing more than 1,800 capsule
profiles of the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The effort
contributed to the Pulitzer Prize awarded to the newspaper this
spring.</TE>
<TE>   New York obituary writer Steve Miller, who escaped from one of the
World Trade Center towers moments before it collapsed, read several
of the profiles Saturday, holding back tears. The stories, he said,
"raised my consciousness that everyone is precious."</TE>
<TE>   Claire Martin said her own experiences with family deaths have
made her an empathetic obituary writer for the Denver Post. "I know
what it's like to be on the other side of an obit.</TE>
<TE>   "And kids are the hardest to write about. I try to include little
details in their stories. Their favorite songs. Their favorite toys.
I'm writing for the family, and I'm writing for all the people who
have experienced a death, because it's a universal experience."</TE>
<TE>   But for all their somber reflections and insightful anecdotes,
families may not always tell the complete story, writers have
learned.</TE>
<TE>   Alana Baranick, of the Plain Dealer in Cleveland, recalled how a
family had pressed for an obituary of a man who appeared to have done
nothing for several years of his life. She investigated and found
that the man had served prison time for murdering his mother. "I told
the family, if we're going to do his obituary, we need to mention
that fact. The family had second thoughts."</TE>
<TE>   Kay Powell, for six years the obituary editor for the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, recalled writing about a man who, according to
the family, died after a fall. She learned weeks later that the man
had fallen because he had been shot by his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   While even the simplest lives can offer important stories, the
challenge to the obituary writer is choosing which ones to tell.</TE>
<TE>   "You just can't say to someone, 'Your daddy's not important
enough,' but that's what you have to say in so many words," Powell
said. "We have 50 deaths a day [in Atlanta], and 48 of them will go
unwritten.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a hard and painful decision on which ones to write. But my
obligation is to give my readers a good read."</TE>

<HD>A Nuclear Confrontation Shapes Up</HD>
<DH>Energy: South Carolina governor vows to stop the U.S. from
shipping bomb-grade plutonium to the Savannah River Site for
disposal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AIKEN, S.C.</DL>
<LD>Imagine 12,000 pounds of bomb-grade plutonium, some of the most
dangerous stuff on Earth, barreling down Interstate 20 in heavily
fortified trucks.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of state troopers stand in the way, their squad cars
barricading the highway.</LD>
<LD>   The governor of South Carolina lies in the road, in his signature
seersucker suit, daring the feds to cross the state line.</LD>
<TE>   It's an absurd scenario. But it could come down to that.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when FBI officials are warning of imminent terrorist
threats, the Department of Energy is planning the largest shipment of
plutonium ever, to a nuclear facility outside Aiken. And Gov. Jim
Hodges has vowed to keep it out--even if it takes a roadblock. He has
sued the Energy Department, ridiculed the federal government in TV
commercials and mobilized state troopers. The shipments, destined for
the Savannah River Site, a sprawling nuclear complex on the Georgia
line, are supposed to begin later this month.</TE>
<TE>   "I've certainly made some dramatic gestures," Hodges said in an
interview last week. "But disposing nuclear weapons, well, that's a
dramatic problem."</TE>
<TE>   Hanging in the balance is enough bomb-making material to produce
at least 5,000 nuclear weapons, an arsenal larger than any country's
except for Russia and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Under arms control agreements with Russia, U.S. government
officials have promised to decommission 34 metric tons of surplus
plutonium. Energy officials have said the plutonium will be promptly
converted into fuel for nuclear power plants, a safer and more stable
form.</TE>
<TE>   Hodges doesn't trust them.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic governor, who believes the Bush administration is
trying to torpedo him politically, said he will allow the plutonium
into the state if the Department of Energy commits in a formal
consent degree to recycling the bomb material--something that has
never been done before--or removing it should that not happen.</TE>
<TE>   Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham has promised not to abandon the
highly radioactive matter in South Carolina. He even put his pledge
in a letter. But Abraham has refused to enter into a court-monitored
consent decree, saying national security issues don't belong in front
of a judge.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the Colorado connection.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Wayne Allard, a Colorado Republican running for reelection
this year, is pushing the Bush administration to get surplus
plutonium out of his state--it's stored at the Rocky Flats
Environmental Technology Site near Denver. The cleanup of the aging
weapon plant is a key part of Allard's campaign platform. Allard
insists, along with energy officials, that much money will be saved
by moving plutonium from Colorado to South Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   But some folks in South Carolina don't buy that. They say the Bush
administration is sacrificing the interests of their state, a
reliable Republican stronghold, to make friends and win votes in
Colorado, historically more of a swing state.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't about national security, the Russians or what's good
for our country," said Dell Isham, executive director of the South
Carolina chapter of the Sierra Club. "It's about politics."</TE>
<TE>   Allard called that "ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't the one who dreamed up this issue right before the
election. He did," Allard said, referring to Hodges--who's also up
for reelection in the fall. "If all the states began to follow his
example, our country would have serious problems." (Earlier this
spring, Allard's press secretary was quoted in the Denver press as
calling Hodges "Elmer Fudd.") The issue goes back to 1997, when
energy officials began looking for ways to dispose of surplus
plutonium. With the Cold War over and the U.S. nuclear arsenal
shrinking, there was no need for all the plutonium triggers, or
"pits," that lie at the heart of thermonuclear weapons. Many of these
grapefruit-sized pits, which are small atomic bombs that trigger much
bigger thermonuclear explosions, were manufactured at Rocky Flats.
They're so dangerous to handle that one whiff results in a 100%
probability of cancer, scientists say. They're also coveted by
terrorists--and guarded very tightly.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure from arms control advocates, American and Russian
officials agreed in September 2000 to dispose of 34 tons each of
pits, plutonium shavings and other bomb-making nuclear material.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. side of the project is estimated to cost $3.8 billion
over 20 years and create 1,300 jobs. Energy officials chose South
Carolina's Savannah River Site because of its technical expertise and
secure facilities. For years, its five reactors produced volumes of
plutonium and tritium, another bomb material; now the 310-square-mile
facility specializes in processing radioactive waste.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the bomb-to-fuel project is new science. France, England,
Germany and India burn similar nuclear fuel, but nowhere is there a
large-scale process to convert weapon-grade plutonium into fuel for
nuclear power plants.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a minefield, politically and scientifically," said Steven
Dolley, research director of the nonprofit Nuclear Control Institute
in Washington. "It's not clear how commercial reactors will handle
this stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Energy officials say the process--called MOX, for "mixed
oxide"--is safe. The plutonium is made less reactive by mixing it
with oxygen.</TE>
<TE>   "Moving forward with the MOX program is a critical part of our
national security," said Joe Davis, a Department of Energy spokesman.
"We don't want to let the Russians down. Or have surplus plutonium
hanging around for someone to steal it."</TE>
<TE>   Originally, a portion of the surplus plutonium was going to be
"immobilized" in molten radioactive glass set in stainless steel
canisters. It's a process that the Clinton administration favored.
But earlier this year, the Energy Department decided to convert all
surplus plutonium into fuel, ignoring environmental groups concerned
about the expansion of nuclear energy.</TE>
<TE>   That change is one of the grounds of Hodges' lawsuit, filed May 1
in federal court in Aiken. Hodges says the government needs to submit
a new environmental impact study before shipments can begin.</TE>
<TE>   Already, he's forced a shipment delay until June 15, the earliest
date the trucks can leave Rocky Flats. The Colorado site will be the
first to send plutonium to South Carolina and will be followed by
other facilities scattered across the United States. The plan is to
house the material in a closed-down reactor at the Savannah River
Site while a MOX facility is built.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Hodges and the U.S. will meet in court June 13.</TE>
<TE>   All this is delaying Allard's dreams of closing Rocky Flats.</TE>
<TE>   The veterinarian-turned-senator, who's in a tight race for a
second term, has spent years trying to turn Rocky Flats into a
wildlife preserve. He's already accelerated the process from an
original projected deadline of 2072 to 2006, and the next step is
removing the plutonium. He says the government will save $600 million
a year by closing Rocky Flats and consolidating surplus plutonium at
Savannah River. "You won't need to pay guards in two places," Allard
said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hodges is hatching plans for a major confrontation--or
at least that's what he wants people to think. Last month, he had the
South Carolina Highway Patrol stage a drill along a highway near the
Savannah River plant in which two dozen troopers practiced blocking a
semi.</TE>
<TE>   He's also taken out TV ads, financed with $100,000 of campaign
money, painting the federal government as reckless.</TE>
<TE>   Hodges lays out a scenario in which the plutonium arrives, the MOX
processing gets stalled or tabled, the promised jobs never come and
South Carolina gets stuck with 34 tons of deadly gray powder.</TE>
<TE>   Tactics aside, he may not have the law on his side.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, Cecil Andrus, then governor of Idaho, blocked a boxcar
full of nuclear waste from entering his state. The action later was
ruled unconstitutional and the boxcar rolled in. (The Energy
Department eventually signed an agreement providing Idaho a timetable
for waste processing and sanctions if deadlines weren't met.)</TE>
<TE>   Hodges has studied what happened in Idaho, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Until there is a legally enforceable agreement that holds the
federal government to its word, I will do everything I can to keep
that plutonium out of South Carolina," Hodges said. "Once it's here,
we lose every bit of leverage."</TE>

<HD>Abuse Victims Willing to Tell Their Stories</HD>
<DH>Church: With experiences locked inside for decades, many
who were molested by priests are beginning to shed their private
shame.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WORCESTER, Mass.</DL>
<LD>First Tom Blanchette poured his heart out, recalling terrible events
from more than 40 years ago. Phil Saviano took the microphone next,
disclosing with no small satisfaction that the priest who had
molested him in the sixth grade is now in prison for 275 years.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Gately came forward, then Bernie McDaid and Susan Brenehan,
whose abuse began with an unwanted kiss from a priest when she was 11
years old.</LD>
<LD>   "For the following three years, he would stalk me," she said. "He
would hear my confession. Then he would sexually abuse me."</LD>
<TE>   These middle-age adults recounted their stories one recent
day--not in the quiet confines of an anonymous support group, but
here in central Massachusetts, on the steps of the Roman Catholic
archdiocese. One by one, a dozen or more victims of abuse by clergy
spoke about experiences locked inside them for decades. Some opened
up in defiance of gag orders imposed by church settlements.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm probably going to regret this," said Michael MacDonald. "But
here goes."</TE>
<TE>   Clerical abuse victims say that for years they felt silenced by
shame, muzzled by lawyers and muffled by a society that did not want
to hear their stories. By their very nature, their crimes stripped
victims of their power, and until now they saw no point in reliving
horrible childhood episodes.</TE>
<TE>   But the flood of scandal sweeping the Catholic Church the last few
months has emboldened them. Thousands who say they were victimized
have implicated hundreds of priests. With strength in numbers, they
are speaking out, loudly and in chilling detail.</TE>
<TE>   Fueled by a new sense of urgency, these victims gathered at the
archdiocese to distribute a list of 21 priests in the region who have
been prosecuted or who have resigned because of sexual abuse
allegations. By doing so, they joined victims across the country who
have called for legislation to eliminate or extend statutes of
limitation. These clerical abuse survivors also are demanding that
all dioceses open their personnel records to prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   At long last, according to many who say they were molested by men
they trusted--members of the clergy--this is their moment.</TE>
<TE>   "We have more credibility than we have ever had," said Saviano,
head of the Massachusetts branch of SNAP, or Survivors Network of
Those Abused by Priests. "That is why so many people are coming
forward. They are being believed. They will get results."</TE>
<TE>   The critical mass of victims began gathering force early this year
with the trial in Boston of former priest John J. Geoghan, who was
convicted on a single charge of fondling a boy at a community pool.</TE>
<TE>   Documents published in the Boston Globe showed the archdiocese
knew about scores of allegations against Geoghan. Rather than
relieving him of duties involving children, church officials
transferred Geoghan from parish to parish.</TE>
<TE>   The ensuing firestorm was fed by records involving Paul Shanley,
another Boston priest, that revealed similar actions by church
officials. In their battle for credibility, victims had new
ammunition.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference was that this was about the cover-up, not just
about the offenders anymore," said Peter Isely, a psychotherapist in
Milwaukee who founded one of the country's first in-patient programs
for clergy abuse victims. Isely, 41, says he was molested as a high
school student in Wisconsin by a priest who was never prosecuted and
who since has died.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, victims who took their complaints to the church were
told that these acts were aberrations and that suspected pedophile
priests would be removed, Isely said. The outpouring of previously
confidential records proved otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   After years of being disbelieved, Isely said, "it was an enormous
validation" to have written evidence that could not be dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   To cover his own psychotherapy costs of about $4,000, Isely in
1989 signed an agreement with Wisconsin church officials that
included a gag order. "I signed it because I wanted it over. Of
course, it wasn't."</TE>
<TE>   Then in 1993, Isely said, he watched an extraordinary news
conference at which dozens of victims of Father James Porter spelled
out what had happened to them in five parishes in southeastern
Massachusetts in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the largest cases of clerical sexual abuse ever
prosecuted, Porter pleaded guilty in 1993 to 41 counts of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   He is scheduled for parole next year.</TE>
<TE>   Despite civil agreements with the local archdiocese that precluded
them from discussing their cases, nearly 100 Porter victims became
the first large group to tell its stories.</TE>
<TE>   For some, such as Frank Fitzpatrick, the urge to speak out became
almost a second career. In 1991, the 52-year-old high school teacher
from Rhode Island founded a group called Survivors Network--really a
database on his home computer--that numbers more than 1,000 abuse
victims.</TE>
<TE>   But the Porter group slipped into obscurity.</TE>
<TE>   Among the newly empowered victims, they sometimes are compared to
Korean War veterans: every bit as injured as those who served in
Vietnam but less recognized.</TE>
<TE>   "The Porters are the foundation. No one sees the foundation when
you build the house," said Gately, 51, a mental health counselor who
was 14 when a priest from New York came to stay with his family near
Boston. The priest molested him, said Gately, who had been an altar
boy and president of his town's Catholic Youth Organization.</TE>
<TE>   "I've known this [current scandal] was coming, at least since
1966," Gately said. "I'm not the least bit surprised by the numerous
acts or by the number of clergy. And I'm not surprised by the denial
from church officials."</TE>
<TE>   The catharsis has a cost, he added. "Many of us feel extremely
re-traumatized. This has been the most painful five or six months for
me since the 1960s."</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, the discomfort is outweighed by the opportunity to
talk openly. "We were not allowed to express it to ourselves, or to
our parents," he said. "When there is literally a 200-pound monkey on
your back and you can't tell anybody--nobody sees it and you are a
kid, you have no authority at all--well, finally, there is that sense
of being heard."</TE>
<TE>   Psychologist Ann Webb of Wellesley, Mass., also was inspired by
the Porter victims to speak publicly about her abuse. A priest
molested her for six years, beginning when she was a kindergartner,
the 49-year-old said. The archdiocese in Rhode Island, where the
abuse occurred, eventually agreed to pay for her psychotherapy but
did not impose a gag order.</TE>
<TE>   After years of holding their stories inside, Webb said, victims
finally have a common agenda: "For people to listen, to not feel like
we're the guilty ones--which all of us grew up feeling."</TE>
<TE>   But some victims have other forms of restitution in mind as well.
Patrick McSorley, 27, was one of 86 alleged Geoghan victims who
signed a settlement with the Boston archdiocese estimated at $15
million to $30 million. The church backed out of the agreement at the
last minute, claiming it did not have the funds to pay the swarm of
additional alleged Geoghan victims who recently have come forward.
Geoghan is serving a nine- to 10-year prison sentence.</TE>
<TE>   McSorley, an unemployed electrician, says he still recalls how
Geoghan took him out for ice cream, then raped him in the car on the
way home. The ice cream melted down his arm.</TE>
<TE>   If he could make church leaders feel the emotional tornado that
has raged inside him since 1986, McSorley said, "I would take that as
payment." Barring that, "the only way to do it is to hit them, hit
them hard and hit them in the pocketbook."</TE>

<HD>Crews See Gains Against Arizona Wildfire</HD>
<DH>Nature: The 23,300-acre Bullock blaze is 60% contained. But
breezes forecast for today could make for some problems on the lines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TUCSON</DL>
<LD>Fire crews were optimistic that they were gaining the upper hand
Saturday against a 23,300-acre wildfire in southern Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   The Bullock fire was 60% contained, and firefighters worked to
maintain existing fire lines and complete new ones, said fire
spokeswoman Joan Vasey.</LD>
<LD>   "We're working toward success and we're getting results," she
said. "We're taking it day by day and hour by hour."</LD>
<TE>   Air tankers and helicopters continued working Saturday to
reinforce fire lines. Firefighters also set more controlled blazes to
remove the fuel that could feed the wildfire.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials warned that residents in Tucson would likely see
smoke over the weekend because of the controlled burns.</TE>
<TE>   Breezy winds were expected from the southwest today and Monday,
potentially leading to warnings of heightened danger, said National
Weather Service meteorologist Melissa Goering.</TE>
<TE>   But Vasey said winds were calm Saturday at Mt. Lemmon, which
towers to the northeast of the city, where fires were being battled.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping to turn the corner today, though we won't be out of
the woods until we get the fire 100%, fully contained," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Crews on Friday saved an array of telecommunications towers and
two telescopes on top of Mt. Bigelow, one of the highest peaks on
9,000-foot Mt. Lemmon.</TE>
<TE>   The fire had been burning for days at the base of Mt. Bigelow,
threatening to race to the top of the 8,250-foot peak. The fire
approached within half a mile of the transmitters and telescopes.</TE>
<TE>   "The mountain is now contained, so things are looking good," Vasey
said.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials estimated the cost of fighting the fire to be more
than $9.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Even after firefighters contain the blaze, people won't be allowed
back into the area until firefighters have determined the area is
safe, Vasey said. One hundred people were evacuated when the fire
began approaching homes.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Zimmerman, a Summerhaven business owner who was forced to
leave 10 days ago, said he doesn't know how long it will take for the
community to recover once residents and business owners are finally
allowed back.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge fire. It's mind-breaking to see how much stuff has
burned," he said. "As far as I can see it's just blackened timbers
standing there.... Soon, we're going to be going into a new phase,
the aftermath."</TE>

<HD>Naturally, Losing Angels Hate Dome</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Angels ought to contribute a few bucks toward the Minnesota
Twins' drive for a new ballpark, one with grass and a view of the
heavens. They can't tear down the Metrodome soon enough for the
Angels, who lost a game Saturday because of a freak bounce on
artificial turf and almost lost their center fielder because some
genius decided the color of the roof ought to be the same color as a
baseball.</LD>
<LD>   This is not to detract from the abilities of the Twins, leaders of
the American League Central. They beat the Angels for the fourth time
in six tries this season, this one a 4-2 victory that featured three
hits from Jacque Jones and a home run from Cristian Guzman.</LD>
<LD>   There is no dishonor in losing to the Twins. Still, the Angels
couldn't help muttering about the Twins' dome-field advantage.</LD>
<TE>   Kevin Appier shut out Minnesota for the first five innings, and
the Twins' Torii Hunter doubled home the tying run in the sixth. With
two out and a runner on third in the seventh, Jones dragged a bunt
along the first-base line. Instead of hugging the turf, the ball
bounced high enough that Appier appeared likely to field it and throw
out Jones to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Appier ran to the spot where he expected to field the ball. Too
bad.</TE>
<TE>   "It just went straight up instead of coming towards me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On the second bounce, with catcher Bengie Molina telling him to
let the ball roll foul, Appier picked it up, with absolutely no
chance to throw out the speedy Jones.</TE>
<TE>   "It was going foul, no doubt about it," Molina said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Appier: "It didn't seem like it was going foul. You grab it
because you never know what's going on. He [Jones] might fall down or
whatever."</TE>
<TE>   As Jones reached first base, A.J. Pierzynski scored from third.
The Twins led, 2-1, and, on the next pitch, Guzman homered. Appier
departed, tagged with the loss after giving up four runs in 62/3
innings.</TE>
<TE>   "It was definitely one of my best-pitched bad games," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels scored once in the second inning, on a double by Brad
Fullmer, and once in the ninth, on a home run by Tim Salmon. They
then put the tying runs on base with none out against Minnesota
closer Eddie Guardado, with David Eckstein available to bat for
either Benji Gil or Adam Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   With Gil prized for his ability to hit left-handers and Kennedy
hitting all comers lately, Angel Manager Mike Scioscia left Eckstein
on the bench. Gil (0 for 6 against Guardado) struck out, and Kennedy
(2 for 8) grounded into a game-ending double play. (Eckstein is 1 for
3 against Guardado.)</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were horribly frightened in the fourth inning, with
their leader and center fielder face down on the turf after colliding
with Gil, the shortstop.</TE>
<TE>   Darin Erstad missed eight games in April while recovering from a
concussion. The Angels are 21-8 since he returned, and they do not
consider their resurgence a coincidence.</TE>
<TE>   With two out in the fourth, Minnesota's Bobby Kielty hit a pop fly
into shallow center field, and Erstad and Gil could not look for each
other because they feared looking away would mean losing the white
ball against the white roof.</TE>
<TE>   As Gil caught the ball, Erstad fell beneath him. Gil's lower right
leg slammed into Erstad's face, and his spikes caught Erstad's right
arm.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad remained face down for several minutes. "I got my bell
rung," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He eventually rose and walked off the field. He remained in the
game, with gashes above his left eye, on his nose and on the arm;
trainers could not stop all the bleeding before his next at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   "I had blood dripping down the side of my face while I was at the
plate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Left fielder Garret Anderson lost a fly ball in the roof, and
Kennedy avoided losing another by chasing a pop fly from second base
into left-center. In the first game of the series, Salmon's foul pop
caromed off a speaker, and Guardado caught it for an out.</TE>
<TE>   New ballpark? If you build it, the Angels will be happy to come.</TE>

<DH>Russell Reineman insists he has no regrets about selling
War Emblem, even though it appears the potential Triple Crown winner
was ...</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIDWAY, Ky.</DL>
<LD>A charming small town ringed by regal thoroughbreds grazing on
rolling hills of vibrant green attracted the nearby Lexington gentry
to a "hamburger hootenanny" at a historic Southern inn on balmy
Memorial Day.</LD>
<LD>   The setting was everything steel-tempered city dweller Russell L.
Reineman has grown to love about this patch of rural Kentucky, a
slow-paced oasis where the racehorses he owns are brought up to
speed.</LD>
<LD>   Although Reineman, 84, was far from Midway last weekend, his name
was prominent in the chit-chat and head-shaking of the horse
breeders, business owners and University of Kentucky professors who
occupied lawn chairs and ate burgers, red potato salad and baked
beans in bourbon sauce while an acoustic band played from the porch
of the 150-year-old Holly Hill Inn.</LD>
<TE>   A shame, really, they declared. Like "Wrong Way" Roy Riegels,
Reineman forever will be associated with a bonehead decision. Where
was the gentleman's horse sense?</TE>
<TE>   Following the advice of his longtime trainer, Frank "Bobby"
Springer, Reineman sold War Emblem five days after the colt had won
the Illinois Derby and 23 days before the Kentucky Derby. Reineman
hadn't entered a horse in the Derby since 1986. War Emblem won it in
stunning fashion.</TE>
<TE>   The spunky 3-year-old also won the Preakness two weeks later and
will race to become the first Triple Crown winner since 1978 in the
Belmont Stakes on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a Greek play, one with elements of both tragedy and
comedy," commented a Midway local over rhubarb cobbler and a glass of
merlot.</TE>
<TE>   Reineman may fail to see the humor, but he has a straightforward
message for second-guessers, from bluegrass insiders to $2 bettors:
"I'm over it."</TE>
<TE>   As for tragedy, War Emblem doesn't even rate show money to
Reineman. His wife died after falling from her beloved jumper during
an early morning ride in 1973, one of his daughters died unexpectedly
six years ago, and the husband of his other daughter died of cancer a
few months later.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a business decision and I stand by it as a good business
decision," he said. "It's one of those things; you can go any way or
think a lot of different things, but I'm not mad or disturbed."</TE>
<TE>   That isn't necessarily the ranting of a stubborn old man who
refuses to recognize the error of his ways. Reineman was shrewd
enough to retain 10% ownership of War Emblem, who is a victory away
from a Triple Crown bonus of $5 million and is expected to be worth
millions more as a sire.</TE>
<TE>   And 10% ownership of a potential Triple Crown winner is worth more
than 100% ownership of a horse standing in his stall, which is where
War Emblem would have been during the Kentucky Derby had Reineman not
sold him.</TE>
<TE>   After the horse had won the $500,000 Illinois Derby on April 6,
Springer persuaded Reineman to skip the run for the roses, reasoning
that the incorrigibly front-running War Emblem would get caught up in
what is often a brutal early fast pace and fade.</TE>
<TE>   They contemplated holding onto the colt and entering the Preakness
to try to win the $1-million bonus that comes with coupling an
Illinois Derby victory with one in a Triple Crown race. But Springer,
exasperated with War Emblem's ornery temperament and seeming
unwillingness to back off from the early pace and make a late run,
believed the time was ripe for Reineman to cash in.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Prince Ahmed Salman of Saudi Arabia and his trainer,
Bob Baffert, watched the Illinois Derby on television several
thousand miles apart and came to the same conclusion: Pursue the
colt. The Prince plunked down $900,000, plus commissions, without
even requesting a veterinary examination.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert did call War Emblem's vet the day of the purchase and,
coincidentally, Springer was in the office and came to the phone. The
two trainers began a cordial relationship that continued through
Derby day.</TE>
<TE>   Reineman was satisfied, believing he had unloaded potential
damaged goods for enough cash to keep him in horse racing at a time
his Chicago steel business was hemorrhaging money.</TE>
<TE>   If he made a mistake during negotiations, it was in not addressing
in the contract how the $1-million bonus would be split. Attorneys
representing Reineman and Prince Salman say they are close to
settling the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't going to run in the Derby anyway," Reineman said.
"Whether that was the right decision, well, it can be debated. But
that's what we decided and that made the Prince's offer a fair deal.</TE>
<TE>   "If I go around losing millions over too many years, I'll
eventually go broke. I hate to sell horses. There's nothing like
watching one of your babies win. I'd keep every horse I breed if I
could. But I can't absorb risks the way [wealthier] owners can."</TE>
<TE>   During 50 years as an owner and breeder, Reineman earned a
reputation as a man of few pretenses. His down-to-earth Midwestern
nature and acquired touch of Kentucky graciousness make him a
favorite of the valets, grooms and bartenders he showers with small
talk and tips. When one of his mostly workmanlike horses wins a
stakes race--there have been about 20--he sends cases of champagne to
the press box.</TE>
<TE>   So what's he supposed to do, now that War Emblem has become Kirk
Gibson, transforming from an ill-tempered physical wreck into a
sports icon for the ages? Reineman decided to enjoy the ride, even if
he's watching from his Chicago home instead of basking in the
winner's circle.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to be 85 in December and this is the best medicine
anybody can prescribe," said Reineman's daughter, Lynne McCutcheon.
"That horse is so awesome. The way it worked out, we couldn't be
happier. It is an incredible story."</TE>
<TE>   McCutcheon runs the day-to-day operations of Reineman's Crown
Steel Sales and also keeps tabs on her father's 135 horses, many kept
at Nuckols Farm in Midway.</TE>
<TE>   "All of our horses can be traced to four or five mares 40 to 50
years ago," McCutcheon said. "That's scary."</TE>
<TE>   Reineman's passion for horses began early. As a youngster in
Pittsburgh, his uncle, trainer Charles Weightman, took him to
Wheeling Downs in West Virginia and Thistledown in Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   "Minors weren't allowed in the gate and my uncle would put a
floppy hat on my head and tell the attendant I was a midget," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up fast in the Depression years, he learned the steel
industry in his teens and in 1955 bought out his brother Howard's
interest in the family business, which he describes as a steel
supermarket.</TE>
<TE>   Reineman also learned horses from Howard, who owned Crown Crest
Farm near Lexington, buying colts from him and eventually beginning a
breeding operation. When Howard sold the farm about 40 years ago,
Reineman began boarding his mares at the 110-year-old Nuckols Farm
and never left.</TE>
<TE>   War Emblem hit the scene when one of Reineman's broodmare's,
8-year-old Sweetest Lady, was bred to 7-year-old Our Emblem and
dropped the foal in one of Charlie Nuckols III's green-trimmed barns
on Feb. 20, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a big foal, black as can be," Nuckols said. "Basically, he
lived an uneventful life, growing up on a 40-acre field with 10 other
foals or yearlings."</TE>
<TE>   War Emblem attracted a bid of only $19,000 at the Keeneland
yearling sale in September 2000 and Reineman bought him back for
$20,000. Several trainers, Elliott Walden and John Ward Jr. among
them, passed because of bone chips in the horse's ankles and what was
diagnosed as a narrow esophagus.</TE>
<TE>   Springer, 55, did his best with him, but War Emblem had won only
$66,000 before earning his $300,000 winner's share at the Illinois
Derby. In Midway, discreet criticism is directed at Reineman's
trainer of 18 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Reineman has been so loyal to this guy, even though he hasn't
produced any good horses," one breeder said. "The best any owner or
farm can do is put horses in good hands."</TE>
<TE>   Daily Racing Form statistics for trainers go back to 1989, and
since then Springer has had 365 wins from 2,583 starters for a modest
winning percentage of 14.1%. His entries are at small- and
medium-sized tracks and he has never had a horse in a Triple Crown
race.</TE>
<TE>   Other trainers at Chicago-area tracks Arlington Park and Hawthorne
say Springer is known for choosing his races carefully, a tendency
that boomeranged with War Emblem.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, Reineman's top trainer was the legendary Woody
Stephens, who died in 1998. But the owner refuses to entertain the
idea that Stephens would have kept the horse and entered him in the
Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   "Woody was one of the best ever," Reineman said. "There's no point
in playing 'What if.'"</TE>
<TE>   He won't even play it with Springer. The men have talked several
times since the sale but have yet to discuss War Emblem.</TE>
<TE>   "What am I going to say about it?" Reineman said.</TE>
<TE>   Springer has mixed feelings, expressing regret at selling his
ticket to the major races, yet adhering to the belief that the
decision made sense at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert credits Springer with providing a detailed evaluation of
War Emblem, enabling the new trainer to make adjustments.</TE>
<TE>   The brash Baffert is the object of scorn for buying what many term
"a ready-made winner" so close to the first Triple Crown race. But
clearly, the trainer made a difference in a short time.</TE>
<TE>   "I know War Emblem was a handful, but after the sale he was a
happy camper," one breeder said. "That shows you the horse had
potential all along."</TE>
<TE>   And in the Preakness, War Emblem proved he had learned to do more
than lead from gate to wire. Jockey Victor Espinoza sat off the lead
until the far turn before cutting him loose.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing people keep overlooking in all of this is that this
dude can run," Baffert said after the race. "I think we all found out
today that opinions die, records live. This horse is for real."</TE>
<TE>   As War Emblem swept down the track, Reineman and his daughter
cheered wildly. Their joy was bittersweet not because they had sold
90% of the horse, but because their deceased loved ones are not here
to share the experience.</TE>
<TE>   Reineman's wife, Marion, loved horses and cherished family visits
to the quaint getaway of Midway. She fell from her hunter, Ginger, on
a farm in Crete, Ill., 29 years ago and died of basal brain damage.</TE>
<TE>   Six years ago, a double tragedy hit, the death of Reineman's
daughter Nancy, a former Broadway dancer and singer, of a damaged
heart valve, and the death of McCutcheon's husband David of throat
cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "That was devastating for my dad," McCutcheon said. "I didn't
think he was going to make it out of that."</TE>
<TE>   Yet he did. And it will be from the unique perspective one
develops over decades of successes and struggles, jubilance and pain
that Russell Reineman roots on War Emblem during the Belmont.</TE>
<TE>   He'll be sitting at home. And should Prince Salman again stand
exultant in the winner's circle, Reineman will wait for a check in
his mailbox big enough for him to continue pursuing his lifelong
passion.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Winning, at Least</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Again getting by with minimal offense, they make
two hits stand up in 2-0 win over Arizona.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A year ago, Andy Ashby was about to undergo season-ending elbow
surgery, Eric Gagne was looking over his shoulder awaiting his next
demotion to the minor leagues and Brian Jordan was playing the
outfield for the Atlanta Braves.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday, that unlikely trio led the Dodgers to an improbable 2-0
win over the division-leading Arizona Diamondbacks. Improbable
because the Dodgers could muster but two hits in a pitching duel that
lasted only two hours in front of 41,516 at Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Ashby allowed five hits in eight innings, Gagne pitched a perfect
ninth for his major league-leading 19th save and Jordan's two-run
home run was the difference.</LD>
<TE>   "That's saying a lot about your pitching," Jordan said of the
Dodgers' ability to win with minimal offensive output. "Andy did a
great job today. We needed to shut them down."</TE>
<TE>   "That was a tremendous pitching performance by Andy Ashby, that's
all you can say," Manager Jim Tracy said. "Eight shutout innings, the
number of ground balls, the double-play balls that he got, never
really in trouble, throwing strikes the entire time ... evidenced by
him throwing 82 pitches in eight innings.</TE>
<TE>   "Just a tremendous pitching performance and it goes without saying
that we made the most of the two hits that we got."</TE>
<TE>   This kind of thing is getting to be a habit for the light-hitting
Dodgers. On Wednesday they got maximum mileage from four hits in a
4-3 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. Two of the hits were two-run
homers, by Jordan and Alex Cora.</TE>
<TE>   Both of their hits Saturday came in the fourth inning and allowed
the second-place Dodgers (32-23) to creep within two games of the
World Series champion Diamondbacks (34-21), with the three-game
series' rubber match today.</TE>
<TE>   Cesar Izturis led off the fourth with a flare single into
right-center field and, with two out, Jordan crushed a 1-and-0 Brian
Anderson fastball over the fence in left-center for his 10th homer of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had some success against Anderson," said Jordan, who is
batting .436 with four doubles, a triple, four homers and 13 runs
batted in in his last 11 games. "He just made a couple of mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   The left-handed Anderson (0-5) struck out four, did not walk a
batter and retired the side in order in six of his seven innings. But
his winless streak as a starter extended to 16 games dating to July
22.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby (5-4), meanwhile, struck out two batters and walked one.</TE>
<TE>   "The main thing I'm trying to focus on is not think about scoring,
not think about the other guy," said Ashby, who won his first two
starts as a Dodger last season before the injury to his right
(throwing) elbow finished his season. An MRI exam June 11 showed a
tear in the flexor muscle and he underwent surgery June 15.</TE>
<TE>   "I just have to do what I have to do, get three outs and take them
one pitch at a time," he said. "We got ground balls, kept it on the
ground and mixed it up."</TE>
<TE>   Ashby stayed ahead of the Diamondbacks with his sinker, though he
ran into danger in the sixth inning, when Tony Womack's single, a
sacrifice by Anderson and Craig Counsell's single put runners at
first and third with one out.</TE>
<TE>   David Dellucci hit a ground ball to third baseman Adrian Beltre,
who looked Womack back to third before throwing out Dellucci, with
Counsell, who was running on the pitch, taking second.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby walked the dangerous Luis Gonzalez, loading the bases, then
got cleanup hitter Erubiel Durazo to ground out meekly to first to
end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   "When Andy Ashby takes the mound you know two things," Tracy said.
"He's going to give you everything he's got every time he goes out
there and he's never going to give in to adversity."</TE>
<TE>   Showing few effects of last season's surgery, Ashby is 3-0 with a
1.31 earned-run average in his last three starts.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he wouldn't have minded had Tracy left him on the mound for
the ninth inning in an attempt to get his first complete game since
July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to finish what you start but the bottom line is we won,"
Ashby said. "That's what [Gagne is] down there for. He's been doing
it all season."</TE>
<TE>   In converting his ninth consecutive save opportunity, 10 of
Gagne's 11 pitches were strikes.</TE>

<KH>LAKERS AT SACRAMENTO GAME 7 Today, 4:30 p.m., Channel 4</KH>
<HD>Eyes on the Prize</HD>
<DH>Lakers have the experience, but Kings have hard-earned
home-court edge</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By this evening, the Lakers and Sacramento Kings will have played
seven times in 16 days.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers will have seen Doug Christie wave to his wife, oh, a
million times.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings will have felt Shaquille O'Neal's shoulder in their
chests about half that many times.</LD>
<TE>   They're talked out, wrung out, refereed out and flopped out, and
yet not played out. By this evening, someone will be put out.</TE>
<TE>   Game 7 of the Western Conference finals, viewed by many as the de
facto NBA championship, is today at Arco Arena, where the Lakers will
play to extend their three-peat grind into a best-of-seven series
against the New Jersey Nets. The Kings have not been to the NBA
Finals since 1951.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of a series that drew its personality from a shot at
the buzzer by Robert Horry, a shot near the buzzer by Mike Bibby, and
a cheeseburger that would not stay put, the Lakers and Kings are
separated by eight points and one reality: home-court advantage.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who finished three games ahead of the Lakers in the
Pacific Division, played hard in most of their regular-season games
and have it, and the Lakers lost to six last-place teams, and don't.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what everybody's played for," Laker Coach Phil Jackson
said. "This is what they played for. This is what we said we could go
above and beyond. We'll see who's right or wrong. That's the
interesting situation. I suppose it's set up because of what Vlade
said ... that if [they] get home-court advantage [they] can beat the
Lakers."</TE>
<TE>   It's a little late for regrets. Sure, a couple wins against the
Chicago Bulls and the Memphis Grizzlies might have put this game at
Staples Center. But that would just get them started.</TE>
<TE>   After 96 games, the 97th will be decided in a place where the
Lakers have won six of their last nine games, in an arena that
reminds many of their college haunts, on a court where they won Game
1 by seven points, and it was more convincing than that.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, without Horry's 25-footer, the Kings would have
been done with this series days ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel comfortable playing in their building," said O'Neal, who,
faced with his first elimination game in two years, dropped 41 points
and 17 rebounds on the Kings. "We know it's us against the world. We
know they're going to be very, very loud. But I think we play better
in adverse situations like that."</TE>
<TE>   That said, the Lakers have never won a Game 7 on the road. Only
nine franchises have, over 14 occasions.</TE>
<TE>   What comforts the Lakers, perhaps, is their 2000 experience
against the Portland Trail Blazers in Game 7 of the Western
Conference finals. Down by 15 in the fourth quarter at Staples
Center, they pulled that one out, and then beat the Indiana Pacers in
six games for their first title under Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't know what they're in for tomorrow," Laker forward Rick
Fox said. "We didn't know the first time we competed in a Game 7. I
can only speak from the experience of being in one before, knowing
how the situation is pressure-filled, and how the adrenaline will go.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been there. We'll relax into it. The last few years we've
been dealing with championship basketball."</TE>
<TE>   What is clear is that yet another series will pass without the
league figuring a way to consistently officiate O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   After every game, the losing coach has run down the referees.
Vlade Divac flopped and Kobe Bryant held and Chris Webber gave up the
ball and O'Neal charged, depending on which news conference you
ducked into, and which coach pretended to be dragged into the
conversation against his will. It's all in the shrug.</TE>
<TE>   As important as the Kings' five or the Lakers' five is the NBA's
three. O'Neal shot one free throw in Game 5 and the Lakers lost by
one. He shot 17 in Game 6, making 13, and they won by four.</TE>
<TE>   "My teammates were looking for me," O'Neal said. "It was a
must-win for us. I told my guys before the game, we've been through
too much to let this slip away. So, we just have to step up to the
challenge. We've always stepped up, especially in the years Phil has
been here. I've been here five, six years. We've been through Kobe
shooting airballs, me missing free throws, Rodman, Rambis, Harris,
getting swept. We've been through a lot as a team, especially the
core of us. We played with a lot of energy, a lot of momentum. I
think we're going to do the same on Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   It is likely that the game, the season and perhaps their chance at
a dynasty-type run, will fall again to O'Neal and Bryant, if not for
the moment, then from habit. They combined for 72 points Friday in
the biggest game of their season, and the stakes only become greater
in the 42 hours since.</TE>
<TE>   "You're supposed to step up," Bryant said. "You're supposed to
lead the team. Absolutely. We accept the pressure that comes along
with this. We accept the responsibilities of it."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he believed O'Neal, who has played on a balky big toe for
most of the season, could come with the same effort, and then the
same results, Jackson said, "I think he can. I think he can be more
effective, perhaps, in his shooting from the field. If he can shoot
that way from the free-throw line, we're home."</TE>

<LD>Kobe Bryant could have called me at 2:30 a.m. and, unlike Shaquille
O'Neal, I would have been awake.</LD>
<LD>   Pajamas flopping like Vlade, mind racing like Bibby, alert and
angst-filled and awaiting Game 7.</LD>
<LD>   You?</LD>
<TE>   Bryant could bloody my nose and I wouldn't miss Game 7. Bobby
Jackson could grab my shirt and it wouldn't keep me from Game 7.
Robert Horry could come to my backyard and demoralize me with a
three-pointer in my face and I would bounce back to watch Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   You?</TE>
<TE>   Don't lie.</TE>
<TE>   I've seen you, with your Los Angeles smarts and sophistication,
dancing and embracing and slobbering all over these NBA Western
Conference finals as if they were being played in your backyard, as
if the Sacramento Kings were shirts and you were skins.</TE>
<TE>   I've seen you, the faded yellow flags flapping over the sleek
black Mercedes-Benz, the blue afros above mock turtlenecks, the
startling wall of photos at Palm Crest Elementary in La Canada
Flintridge, 20 first-graders posing not in Sunday clothes, but Shaq's
jersey.</TE>
<TE>   I've heard you too, shouting and stomping and howling behind me at
Staples Center, louder than the 110, more crowded than the 405, more
chaos than a Sig Alert.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday night you were even heard over at Dodger Stadium,
thousands of folks with their eyes on a baseball game and their ears
pressed to the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Johnson was pitching, yet Kobe Bryant was firing, and that's
whose name was being chanted late in the game, throughout the stands,
free throws overshadowing fastballs.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Karros was batting, yet Mike Bibby was missing a
three-pointer at the end of the game, so there erupted a giant cheer,
and an apparently surprised Karros took a called third strike from
Byung-Hyun Kim, and who can blame him? This sound of Angelenos
showing passion about something beyond the limits of their
neighborhoods is a strange one indeed.</TE>
<TE>   That's you.</TE>
<TE>   A sprawling, diverse metropolis transformed, if ever so briefly,
into a small town.</TE>
<TE>   Transformed not by government, but by a basketball team.</TE>
<TE>   No secession here, Chickie baby.</TE>
<TE>   Even in a city that can't even agree whether it's a city will
agree today on one thing:</TE>
<TE>   Arco Arena, 4:30 p.m., Channel 4, the ultimate game of what has
become an ultimate sort of playoff series.</TE>
<TE>   What sports does best, sports is doing again. And if you still
don't believe it, look at the television ratings for Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   More than half of the televisions that were flickering in Los
Angeles were tuned to the Laker game. Can you imagine more than half
of our diverse population agreeing on anything?</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, you only see a number like that in a smaller city,"
said Kevin Sullivan, NBC spokesman, speaking of the local 52 share.
"This is a fantastic number for any town, but particularly L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Flash back a week, to Horry's game-winning three-pointer in Game 4
at Staples. With nobody leaving and nobody sitting and everybody
howling, Glenn Frey walked past the press table with a dazed smile.</TE>
<TE>   "The Eagles never had a song like this."</TE>
<TE>   It has been many years since Los Angeles felt like this.</TE>
<TE>   The first championship of this Laker era was new and fun. The
second championship was so dominating, it was boring.</TE>
<TE>   This one is different. This one feels closer to the heart. This
one cuts deeper to the core of what it is like to be a sports fan in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody from Northern California coming down here to try to steal
something. Somebody young, upstart, full of themselves. Somebody with
the sheer nerve to already grab three-fourths of it, forcing the
Lakers to make that dreadful trip north to grab it back.</TE>
<TE>   It will all come together today, the cheeseburgers, cowbells,
cruddy referees, pregame air kisses, the postgame whines.</TE>
<TE>   Six games, four of which were decided in the final seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Two game-winning shots. Two game-winning defensive stops. Every
day something different, players either rising to the moment or
collapsing under its weight, some players doing both, sometimes in
the same possession.</TE>
<TE>   Today, all of it whittled into 48 minutes that will turn the
Lakers in one of two directions.</TE>
<TE>   They lose, and it's the last game of a nice little run.</TE>
<TE>   They win, and it's the first game of a dynasty.</TE>
<TE>   In claiming the pressure is on the Kings--as O'Neal did
immediately Friday night--the Lakers are denying the one aspect that
would make this series victory one of the sweetest in club history.</TE>
<TE>   No, the pressure is not on the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   It is not the Kings who are trying to win a third consecutive
championship.</TE>
<TE>   It is not the Kings who realize the NBA requires at least three
consecutive championships before true greatness can be bestowed.</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Celtics of the mid-1960s, with eight consecutive
championships, are legendary.</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit Pistons and Houston Rockets, with two consecutive
championships each in the 1980s and 1990s, are forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   Today the Lakers have a choice.</TE>
<TE>   They can take their biggest step toward joining the Celtics and
Minneapolis Lakers and Chicago Bulls as one of the greatest teams in
NBA history.</TE>
<TE>   Or they can join the Pistons and Rockets as nice little
diversions.</TE>
<TE>   And they must make that choice in a hostile arena where they were
defeated by a last-second shot only last week.</TE>
<TE>   The pressure is on the Kings? Please.</TE>
<TE>   Here's hoping that the officiating is fair. Here's hoping the
players don't dissolve under the greatest heat in pro sports, a
common occurrence in seventh games.</TE>
<TE>   And here's hoping, after it ends, no matter who wins, Commissioner
David Stern will step over the certain litter of bodies and hopes and
ask an unusual but, given the circumstances, completely reasonable
question.</TE>
<TE>   Best of nine?</TE>
