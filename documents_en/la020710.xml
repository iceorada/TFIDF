<LD>It will be unusually quiet at the Garnett house during the week when
Margaret Garnett's 7-year-old quadruplets, Iman, Imani, Rojay and
Romello, will be away from their home for the Salvation Army's Camp
Mount Crags. The fraternal foursome--two girls, two boys--have been
looking forward to going to the Calabasas camp, though their mother
cautions that the counselors had better prepare for the kids, whom
she refers to as "a handful."</LD>
<LD>   Garnett jokes that they scared away their first-grade teacher at
Jefferson Elementary in Hawthorne, who isn't returning this fall.
"They are going to separate them for second grade."</LD>
<LD>   This may be a case where camp is more of break for the parent than
for the children. Garnett was diagnosed with severe lupus after her
pregnancy and the disease has begun affecting her major
organs--making it a challenge to keep up with quadruplets. The
children's father died in 1999, which has also been difficult. "Just
last week, they found their dad's hats. I still have his clothes and
stuff, and he wore different color cowboy hats every day," Garnett
said. "Now the boys are wearing them."</LD>
<TE>   The high level of camp activity will be nothing new for the
children, who are already involved in everything from music to
scooters to business ventures. The girls, Iman and Imani, are trying
to start their own clothing line for kids, and are creating an
exercise video for overweight children. Their mother is helping them
design the clothes, and a trainer from Bally's is helping them with
their aerobics routines. "Imani has already decided she wants to be
Miss California, and Iman says she's going to be Miss Louisiana when
she grows up," said the 51-year-old homemaker, who supports the
family with Social Security benefits.</TE>
<TE>   While the girls are working on their dress patterns, Rojay can be
found busily dismantling the house. "I noticed all the facings on the
wall for the lights were off, and was trying to figure out what was
going on," Garnett said. "Rojay took off 15 of them before I called
the maintenance man to put them back." All four also play music
together in the house, which means banging on drums, playing guitars,
singing "and a lot of loud noise," said their mother. "Before we got
the drums, they would bang on a box. " Their weeklong stay at camp,
with support from The Times summer camp campaign, will mark the
first-graders' first time away from their mother, which makes them a
little nervous. "They are trying to recruit me, saying, 'You want to
come? You want to come?' But they are very excited," said Garnett.</TE>
<TE>   Every year since 1954, readers and employees of The Times have
sent thousands of children to summer camp. This year more than 11,000
needy children will experience a special summer thanks to the $1.6
million raised last year.</TE>
<TE>   The average cost of sending a child to camp for a week is $150.
This year, the McCormick Tribune Foundation will match the first $1.2
million in contributions at 50 cents on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Checks should be sent to: L.A. Times Summer Camp Campaign, File
No. 56984, Los Angeles, CA 90074-6984. For more information, call
(213) 237-5771. To make credit card donations, visit www.la
times.com/summercamp. Do not send cash.</TE>
<TE>   All donations are tax-deductible. Unless donors request otherwise,
gifts of $25 or more are acknowledged in The Times. The summer camp
campaign is part of the Los Angeles Times Family Fund, a fund of the
McCormick Tribune Foundation.</TE>

<DH>His custom-built choppers have won over many celebs. Now
Jesse Gregory James has attained star status himself in biking
circles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL P. LUCAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You might want to bring ear protection if you visit Long Beach's
unlikeliest tourist attraction, because Jesse Gregory James' workshop
is a temple of glorious thunder: It rumbles deeply from oversized
stereo speakers drumming out punk music; it rings dully from a 50-ton
power hammer; and it cracks sharply from the chrome pipes of freshly
minted $100,000 motorcycles.</LD>
<LD>   West Coast Choppers sits in an aging building on a gritty corner
of Anaheim Street in the city's industrial district. But thanks to a
new TV series fueling James' mystique as a remarkably creative
builder of muscle bikes, a crowd gathers here every weekday morning.</LD>
<LD>   Middle-class couples in Hawaiian shirts mingle with barrel-chested
and beefy-armed men in gray ponytails and ZZ Top beards. Most tote
cameras, a few carry babies, and all hope to meet the impresario of
all the noise and chrome: the 33-year-old descendant of the fabled
Old West outlaw. Well over 6 feet tall, with dirty-blond hair and
striking blue eyes, James says his great-great-grandfather was cousin
to the notorious bank and train robber. If looks are any indication,
this James might have run with the same crowd had he lived then. His
rock-hard and sinewed forearms are tattooed with orange flames,
skulls and his fiancee's name, Janine.</LD>
<TE>   But when asked to explain his growing popularity, he flashes an
incongruously boyish smile. "I don't know; I'm just a metalworker,"
he says with a shrug as he strolls through his shop past a welder
forming a part through a shower of yellow sparks and past that power
hammer, which is gaily painted with orange flames and nicknamed
Thumper. He points out a bike he's building for actor Keanu Reeves.
"I think people like watching somebody who knows what he wants and
does it and doesn't care what anybody thinks."</TE>
<TE>   The son of a Lynwood antiques/castoffs dealer ("He was kind of a
white Fred Sanford," James quips of his father), young Jesse was
fascinated with motors and began tearing them down and rebuilding
them before reaching his teens. He got into a few scrapes with the
law--"the usual adolescent stuff," he explains--and ended up in
continuation high school.</TE>
<TE>   It was there that he decided he would someday own a custom
motorcycle shop. He even had a bundle of T-shirts printed with an
iron cross logo, which he still uses. He started his business in a
garage, moved up to a small shop of his own and expanded to this
location five years ago. Along the way, he built bikes of such
distinction that word spread through the motorcycle community.</TE>
<TE>   He also attracted the attention of producer Thom Beers, who
created a pair of TV specials around James' artistry, titled
"Motorcycle Mania" that aired last year on Discovery Channel. Ratings
were so high that the network and Beers spun that project into a
miniseries called "Monster Garage" that recently aired. The network
has ordered nine more episodes that will go into production later
this summer. On the show, James comes across as kind of an easygoing
foreman, conducting teams of mechanics transforming ordinary vehicles
into weirdly functional Frankencars--as when they turned a Mustang
into a lawnmower on super-steroids.</TE>
<TE>   Beers says the show works in large part because of James'
intriguing on-camera persona. "He's the perfect Gen-X antihero," he
said. "He doesn't want to be worshiped ... he really believes in what
he does, and he has a great sense of style."</TE>
<TE>   If you've ever watched Alta Loma artist Sam Maloof build a rocking
chair, you'll get an idea of what James does with metal. His bikes
all have certain trademark embellishments such as the iron cross that
appears on brake pedals and air cleaners, and faux revolver cylinders
loaded with .44 magnum shell casings on the handlebar risers and more
on the oil and fuel filler caps. But the look he gives to the frames,
forks, gas tanks and fenders creates a striking fluidity of line.
James builds about 12 bikes a year, with starting prices now a bit
under six figures, and has a growing list of celebrity clients such
as Reeves and Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal, Ty Law of the New
England Patriots and wrestling star Bill Goldberg.</TE>
<TE>   As a knot of fans gathers outside his shop to watch through a
wrought-iron gate in the form of a giant spider web, James pauses at
his latest great work, a bike he is finishing for actor Tyson
Beckford, who later says that he had only one specific request of
James.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him he could do anything, but the one thing I wanted was
that the bike be red," Beckford says. "I wanted a red bike. But he
had to go do his own damn thing."</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted it in all red," James admits, "but I took the chance to
do it in two different shades of white with red highlights, and he
was pretty worried about it, and my girlfriend was saying, 'Why don't
you do it the way he wanted and everything will work out.' "</TE>
<TE>   "When I finally saw it," Beckford says, "I just had to cry. It's
the most beautiful thing I've ever owned."</TE>
<TE>   Heading out to the showroom, James points out one of his quirkier
designs: the front fender of a new bike sports a dinosaur. It's a
motorcycle commissioned by the Discovery Channel as the grand prize
in a viewers contest. Next, James poses for pictures and scribbles
autographs.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband wouldn't let me come home without this," says Cathy
Hadden of Augusta, Ga., beaming over a copy of the West Coast
Choppers catalog James has signed. "We've got a stack of motorcycle
magazines in the living room, and Jesse's picture is in almost every
one of them."</TE>
<TE>   She and the other chopper lovers don't seem to notice when star
NFL running back Jamal Anderson walks in to check the progress of the
bike he's ordered. "I'm kind of used to that by now," says Anderson.
"Usually, people recognize me wherever I go, but at the [motorcycle]
rallies or here, the people are going right by me and saying, 'Jesse!
Jesse!' like he's some kind of star. But the truth is that he really
is an artist," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Later, James bounds upstairs to his office, where he has one table
covered with skulls--most of which appear to be replicas. His desk is
a massive 19th century oak piece with papers stuffed in pigeonholes.
An Ithica double-barreled 12-gauge shotgun is within arm's length of
his computer.</TE>
<TE>   And yet another link to a rebellious ancestor is visible. James
flashes the palm of his hand, revealing the motto tattooed there:
"Pay up, sucker."</TE>

<LD>Second of two parts</LD>
<LD>   KERNVILLE--When we last met, the Kern River was threatening to
swallow us like hors d'oeuvres, and a couple of the dads were talking
about the cultural significance of "The Beverly Hillbillies" and
making plans to have a well-chilled beer at the end of the raft trip.</LD>
<LD>   "Jethro Bodine is the primary comic character," my friend Rocky is
saying. "Because what does Jethro want to be? A double-aught spy. But
he betrays himself as the yeoman farmer."</LD>
<TE>   "And Granny is still fighting the Civil War," my friend Bill adds.</TE>
<TE>   "Exactly."</TE>
<TE>   You meet a lot of crazies out here in the woods. Often, they're
your friends.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's this British guy, one of the guides, who leads us
coolly through stretches of rock and water like someone shooting 18
holes. Churchill is his name. Dave Churchill. Wears a helmet
decorated with the British flag, because most folks assume he's
Australian.</TE>
<TE>   "Nice work, mates!" Churchill says after we pinball through a
stretch of whitewater.</TE>
<TE>   "What'd he say?"</TE>
<TE>   "We did OK, mate," says the boy.</TE>
<TE>   For three days, we have been working our way down the Forks of the
Kern, one of America's finest rafting rivers. We've eaten
strawberries and jerky for lunch. Steak for dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, when we last met, we were having a heck of a time, crazies
and all. An adventurous trip--bruising but not brutal.</TE>
<TE>   Now along comes Carson Falls.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the big daddy," a guide warns.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was the big daddy," my friend Howard says.</TE>
<TE>   "Not anymore," someone says.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis and Clark had the rugged Bitterroot Mountains to contend
with. We have Carson Falls.</TE>
<TE>   Our little armada of fathers and sons is itching to try Carson
Falls, the final and most difficult hurdle on our 20-mile raft trip.
There's three lawyers, a minister, the car guy. If anyone is
frightened, he's not talking.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't wait for Carson," the boy keeps saying.</TE>
<TE>   "Me either," I lie.</TE>
<TE>   Not since our honeymoons have the dads faced anything quite this
strenuous. We are mostly in our mid-40s. Our foreheads are like
camper shells. Our shoulders wide yet soft. We drive decent cars and
live in nice homes. When something bad happens in our lives, we call
someone to fix it. The roof. The furnace. An aging tooth.</TE>
<TE>   But there's no fixing Carson Falls.</TE>
<TE>   It is crafted of granite, permanently fractured, edges like an ax.</TE>
<TE>   Through it runs the Kern. On the surface, pretty as a petticoat. A
swirling caldron below.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure you want to do this?" I ask the boy.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Oh sure, nothing to fear here. If you survive the 10-foot
waterfall, there's a suck hole 20 yards beyond. Hit that wrong, and
your wife is out dating again.</TE>
<TE>   Hit it wrong, and the yard won't be mowed for months. The new
kitchen will never be painted. At Christmas, your wife puts up the
tree herself, cursing you the entire time. How's that for a legacy?</TE>
<TE>   "Mates, the way to run this," Churchill says, "is to stay close to
that giant boulder."</TE>
<TE>   We have parked our rafts and are standing on the shore studying
Carson Falls. As we watch, thousands of gallons of snowmelt crash
against the rocks. In its spit, rainbows form.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not so bad," the boy finally says, and three grown men
laugh.</TE>
<TE>   I look at the boy. He won't look at me now.</TE>
<TE>   "When we hit the falls, I want everyone to get down into the raft
and just hold on," Churchill says.</TE>
<TE>   "Stay in the boat," says Rocky. "Like in 'Apocalypse Now.' "</TE>
<TE>   "Nice reference," I mumble. On my right, I have Churchill. On my
left, Francis Ford Coppola.</TE>
<TE>   So we pile back in our raft, me and Rocky, our two sons,
Churchill.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm staying with the boat," I tell the boy.</TE>
<TE>   "Me too," he says.</TE>
<TE>   And for the first 10 seconds of our voyage, things go incredibly
well. Then, even before we reach the waterfall, we bump this little
lip of rock that sends Rocky flying out of the raft.</TE>
<TE>   "Get him in the boat!" Churchill yells as we approach the
waterfall. "Get him in the boat!"</TE>
<TE>   Big guy, Rocky. Two-hundred-plus pounds of Ivy League lawyer,
bobbing like a champagne cork in the churning Kern. When he goes in,
the river rises about 3 inches.</TE>
<TE>   "Get him in the boat!" the guide yells.</TE>
<TE>   I know this is serious because Churchill has lost his British
accent. For two days, he has sounded like a young midfielder for
Manchester United. Now he's talking American.</TE>
<TE>   "Get him in the #%*&amp;x!# boat!"</TE>
<TE>   Seconds before the waterfall, Rocky's son Nick and I manage to
pull Rocky back in the boat. He gasps as if harpooned.</TE>
<TE>   "You OK?"</TE>
<TE>   "Who?"</TE>
<TE>   "Get down!" Churchill yells.</TE>
<TE>   In slow motion, here's what happens next:</TE>
<TE>   We all hit the floor as the raft belly-flops over the falls, which
causes my knees to push up into my chin, which causes my central
nervous system to completely collapse.</TE>
<TE>   So far, so good.</TE>
<TE>   The raft slams into the water, jiggles like a starlet, then
bounces wickedly across the rapids.</TE>
<TE>   "Hold on!" Churchill screams.</TE>
<TE>   Hold on? To what? To Rocky? There's no telling when he'll go
flying back in the river. To my son? Yeah, right. There's 30 years of
therapy.</TE>
<TE>   "Hold on!" I scream as we tumble down Carson Falls, a pleasant
ride if you have the loins for it, but not without an occasional
risk.</TE>
<TE>   "Whew!" someone yells when we clear the last rapids.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes!" says the boy.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes!" says Nick.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone OK?" Churchill asks.</TE>
<TE>   I have a bruise the size of Cincinnati. Rocky looks like he just
wrestled Moby-Dick. Sure, we're fine.</TE>
<TE>   And onward down the mighty Kern we go.</TE>

<HD>Putting Death in a Deep Freeze</HD>
<DH>Proponents of cryonics--they're still out there--hope for
another turn at bat</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN CARPENTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first person Robert Ettinger froze was his mother. The founder of
cryonics, the practice of freezing dead bodies for possible
resuscitation in the future, stuck her in a vat of liquid nitrogen in
1977.</LD>
<LD>   In a few years Ettinger, now 83, plans to join her, his wife (whom
he placed in "cryonic suspension" in 2000) and the 39 other people
he's keeping in a deep freeze at his Michigan-based Cryonics
Institute. His reason: "Life is more interesting than death."</LD>
<LD>   Like the son of baseball great Ted Williams, who is said to have
placed his father in an Arizona cryonics facility, Ettinger believes
that one day death will be reversible. That's why he refers to the
bodies he's preserving as "patients."</LD>
<TE>   "We expect to revive them," he said. "We don't regard them as
irretrievably dead. We regard them as people that we're taking care
of and expect to see."</TE>
<TE>   The idea of cryonics has yet to be embraced by the greater public,
however. The United States is the only country in the world that
offers the service, and it is widely scoffed at in the worlds of
medicine and science. Only a handful of companies perform it, and
only about 100 people are currently in suspension, waiting for
medicine to catch up with their dream of living again.</TE>
<TE>   Why keep freezing bodies when cloning is all the rage?</TE>
<TE>   "Cloning doesn't do anything for you," said Ettinger. "All it does
is get you a twin."</TE>
<TE>   Freezing is better, he contends. You get the actual individual, if
the person can be revived.</TE>
<TE>   It's of course illegal to freeze someone before he or she has
died, Ettinger said, but from a cryogenics standpoint, it would be
preferable to preserve a healthy body rather than one that's worn
out.</TE>
<TE>   Most suspended "patients" contract with the cryonics companies in
advance, the presumption being that a fresh body is better than one
that's been sitting around for a few days, though no one seems able
to say exactly how dead a body can be before it's considered too late
for freezing.</TE>
<TE>   "The only rigid rules we have in the case of people who are not
already signed up is we will not accept anybody who has been exhumed
or who hasn't been cooled two days," said Ettinger.</TE>
<TE>   Because the timing of death, like advances in science, isn't
predictable, most cryonics companies have emergency contact
information so they can be reached while the person is in the process
of dying or immediately after. The chances of a death occurring in
the vicinity of a cryonics facility are slim. There are only
four--one in Michigan, one in Arizona and two in Northern California,
in San Leandro and Mountain View.</TE>
<TE>   The companies hope for enough lead time to coordinate with local
funeral directors so they know how to prepare the body for its
imminent freeze. The procedure calls for "washing" the blood of the
deceased with a special solution, then treating the body with
glycerol to reduce freezer damage before shipping it off to the
cryonics lab for suspension.</TE>
<TE>   At the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Arizona, the largest
such facility with about 50 "patients" currently in suspension, the
bodies are kept in vertical cylinders that are filled with liquid
nitrogen and cooled to minus 196 degrees Celsius.</TE>
<TE>   The bodies are placed head-down in the cylinders so that if the
coolant ever runs low, the brain will be protected. The cost for such
a service: $120,000 for a full-body suspension, $50,000 for the head
alone.</TE>
<TE>   "It's extremely affordable," Alcor's Dr. Jerry Lemler told CNN in
an interview Tuesday, especially if it's funded through life
insurance, as many customers (both dead and living) have arranged it
to be.</TE>
<TE>   The prices at Ettinger's Cryonics Institute are significantly
lower. They do not offer the head-only version, but full-body prices
start at $28,000--the same amount the company charged when it first
opened up shop in 1976. The lower cost may have something to do with
the vats being communal--they can hold as many as 14 bodies--but more
likely it's because there's very little overhead to such an
operation. The Cryonics Institute has only one paid employee. The
building where the bodies are cooled is paid in full. And it only
costs about $200 a year to keep a body in liquid nitrogen, even
topping off the vats, which they do every week or so.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there's no guarantee that any of these companies will
be able to 1) stay in business long enough for scientists to learn
how to reverse the cause of death, 2) deal with the physical
deterioration that occurred between death and freezing, 3) undo the
damage caused by the freezing process and 4) cure old age, since most
cryogenic "patients" are old.</TE>
<TE>   It's an incredibly tall order, one that even cryonics' most
optimistic proponents don't expect to be filled for another 20 to 200
years--long after the people who are currently running these
companies are dead and, most likely, in storage themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no guarantee about the future whatsoever. We can only do
the best we can," said Ettinger, who first came up with the idea of
cryonics in 1962, when he self-published the book "The Prospect of
Immortality." Interest in the subject grew, and the book was picked
up by Doubleday two years later.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until 1967 that it was put into practice, however, when
Dr. James Bedford offered himself up to be flash-frozen by the
now-defunct Cryonics Society of California in the first public
cryonic suspension. Bedford's body is now hanging upside-down in a
silver tube at Alcor, where Ted Williams' body is said to be housed.</TE>
<TE>   "In a lot of cases in death, there's a sense of loss, but I think
cryonics gives us a measure of hope," said Guy Desrosiers, president
of the Canadian Cryonics Society. "That's not to say cryonics will be
successful, but it shows a positive attitude and a proactive
approach. I think one day Mr. Williams may thank his son."</TE>

<LD>Even for those who believe in an afterlife, it is difficult to
imagine the circumstances under which Christopher Columbus, Rosa
Parks and Sonny Bono would find themselves hanging around together.
After discussing the obvious--thank God Cher's on tour again--what on
Earth would they talk about? Well, perhaps their mutual ownership of
Interstate 10.</LD>
<LD>   At its West Coast point of origin, there is a sign announcing that
the road most locals consider the Santa Monica Freeway is, indeed,
the Christopher Columbus Transcontinental Highway. A few miles down
the road, just past the 405 overpass, it becomes for nine miles the
Rosa Parks Freeway. At the intersection with the Harbor Freeway,
Santa Monica gives way to San Bernardino until it becomes the
Redlands Freeway. At the Route 111 cutoff, a sign announces the Sonny
Bono Memorial Freeway, which leads to another portion of road named
for pioneering local doctor June McCarroll.</LD>
<LD>   As the thoroughfare makes its way across the country, the
transcontinental name-dropping could go on and on, but who has that
kind of time? If you want your bit of Caltrans props, if you want
your name seen by millions of motorists every year, then you'd better
get the ear of some Sacramento politico right now because they're the
ones who make these things happen and, frankly, the good freeways are
going fast.</LD>
<TE>   According to Daniel Faigin, a highway historian and master of
www.cahighways.org, memorial freeways are a fairly new thing for the
southern part of the state. Northern Californians have been naming
routes after the lauded and the fallen since the 1950s, but it's only
been in the last five or six years that the Southland has followed
suit.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, freeways have always been named for the end destination,"
says Faigin, whose Web site is so thorough that Caltrans officials
recommend it. "The trend by state legislators to name these tiny
segments for people is pretty new."</TE>
<TE>   The Rosa Parks Freeway was, in fact, inaugurated just this
February after being introduced into legislation last year by
Assemblyman Herb Wesson (D-Culver City), now speaker of the lower
house. Along with neighboring Sonny Bono, and, of course, former
President Reagan, hers is perhaps the most well-known moniker on a
memorial freeway. The majority of names that flash by belong to
outstanding local leaders and to police officers who died too young.
So if you're wondering--as I was--how one goes about getting a route
of one's own, well, unfortunately, the first step is death.</TE>
<TE>   Which seems to me a real waste. The decade-old adopt-a-highway
program allows the living a little drive-by attention in exchange for
keeping a portion of the roadside tidy; perhaps Caltrans could solve
some of its unending fiscal and community-activist woes by combining
the two programs. Just as they do with museums and zoos and
cathedrals, individuals or corporations could pay for highway
extensions or improvements in exchange for their own personal bit of
freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine the possibilities. Your name looked to with the gratitude
of thousands of commuters each day as they sail through the finally
re-engineered Harbor/Golden State exchange or the newly widened 101
South from Woodland Hills. Dollars to doughnuts the 710 would be
cruising through South Pasadena right now if the state had offered to
name the new extension after top citizens. And this doesn't have to
be confined to freeways; surface streets could benefit as well. Mayor
Jim Hahn has boasted for months about the increased number of
left-hand-turn signals he has bestowed upon this city; imagine how
many more would be making your life easier right now if, say, 3rd
Street between La Brea and Fairfax could be named after some generous
benefactor.</TE>
<TE>   If the state worked the room right, the real stars would no longer
be immortalized in the sidewalk along Hollywood Boulevard, but on
green signs at five-mile increments along the Hollywood Freeway.</TE>

<LD>'Le Corsaire'</LD>
<LD>   What would you think of a performance that included pirates, evil
slave traders and a sinking ship? You probably wouldn't think of a
ballet, but that's just what you have in one of the most famous
classical ballets of all time--"Le Corsaire."</LD>
<LD>   "Le Corsaire" ("the pirate" in French) is a swashbuckling love
story about a handsome pirate and a beautiful slave girl who battle
double-crossing comrades, cruel warlords and even the high seas. It
is filled with beautiful dancing, laughter, love and hair-raising
scuffles.</LD>
<TE>   "Le Corsaire" is coming to L.A.'s Music Center for five
performances only, danced by one of the world's most famous ballet
companies, the American Ballet Theatre. Many of ABT's most famous
dancers will perform.</TE>
<TE>   Children and their families are invited to a free Family Day on
Saturday in the Music Center plaza to learn more about ballet, "Le
Corsaire" and the American Ballet Theatre. The event takes place
before the 2 p.m. performance, from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. There
will be ballet demonstrations, workshops, art activities and
storytelling. Model and actress Cindy Crawford is one of the featured
storytellers.</TE>
<TE>   Performances are Thursday through Sunday at the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion. Tickets, ranging in price from $20 to $90, are available at
the Music Center Box Office or Ticketmaster--(213) 365-3500. For more
information, visit www.musiccenter.org and www.abt.org.</TE>

<LD>"Ronald Morgan</LD>
<LD>   Goes to Bat"</LD>
<LD>   by Patricia Reilly Giff</LD>
<TE>   Did you know that if you face your fears you can do almost
anything? In this book, there's a boy named Ronald Morgan. He
couldn't hit or catch the ball in a baseball game. He tried and
tried, but he couldn't do it. But when he closed his eyes, he hit the
ball. He was really surprised.</TE>
<TE>   This book is good because it teaches you that if you keep trying
you can do it. It has surprises at the end. You'll have to read the
book to find out what they are.</TE>

<TE>   (Natural Disasters)"</TE>
<TE>   by Michele Ingber Drohan</TE>
<TE>   A tsunami is a group of waves that move across the ocean, one
after another. These waves are not like normal waves made by the
wind. Instead, tsunamis form because of a disturbance in the ocean.
When a tsunami reaches the coast, the waves can be as high as 100
feet. Most often, a tsunami does not look like a big wave. It looks
like a huge wall of water moving forward.</TE>

<LD>Independent and niche publishers are the real success stories of the
contemporary American book trade. So it probably was only a matter of
time before a new niche book review emerged.</LD>
<LD>   The "preview issue" of Bookmarks, based in San Mateo, began
circulating this week. Its founders are two former software and
technology company executives; its target is media-savvy Gen-Xers who
haven't really read a book since college but are eager to reconnect
with literature, though uncertain how to do it.</LD>
<LD>   Bookmarks--which bills itself as the journal "for everyone who
hasn't read everything"--is a glossy, slightly fizzy bimonthly survey
of classic and contemporary literature designed for readers who like
their graphic interfaces glitzy and their information in strobe-like
bites.</LD>
<TE>   Think of it as a literary halfway house for recovering dot-comers
and their codependents.</TE>
<TE>   What it shares with traditional book reviews is a certain idealism
about books and reading. Publisher Allison Nelson and editor Jon
Phillips met at Harvard Business School, then spent several years
working in business development, marketing and technology development
at Silicon Valley firms. When both found themselves with young
families and in need of a change of direction, they conceived a
start-up based on their love of reading.</TE>
<TE>   As Phillips explained, "We created a magazine we wanted to read."</TE>
<TE>   Though each issue will feature "book-by-book profiles" of classic
authors and publishing news, the magazine's staple is a survey of
current literature that provides a synopsis of a given book, excerpts
from its reviews in established critical journals--including The
Times' Book Review--and a consensus of opinion represented by the
familiar star-based rating system. (Five stars indicate a classic,
"one of the best of its kind;" one marks a book that is "not worth
your time."</TE>
<TE>   Booker Prize-winner Ian McEwan's latest novel, "Atonement," gets 4
1/2 stars; Richard Posner's "Public Intellectuals: a Study of
Decline" gets just one.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that our approach is drawn from what we've learned about
the integrative potential of the Web," said Phillips. "To use the new
media term, we are 'aggregating content,' and obviously the Web
spurred some of those ideas for us. But what we are trying to do is
also a reaction to the increasing marginalization of book coverage in
so many magazines and newspapers. In that sense, we're a publication
for people who want to come home to books but have made other media
choices for a long time and now are intimidated by the considerable
investment of time learning about books requires. There's an ocean of
book choices but a puddle of advice on what to read."</TE>
<TE>   Bookmarks' first regular bimonthly issue will be available on
newsstands in September. In the meantime, copies of the preview issue
can be obtained by sending an e-mail to preview@bookmarks
magazine.com.</TE>
<TE>   Publisher in Peril</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in a publishing universe far, far away, the travails of
what might be called the literary-industrial complex seem to continue
apace.</TE>
<TE>   According to a recent issue of the German newsmagazine Der
Speigel, that country's von Holtzbrinck Group--a family-controlled
and intensely private media company--is hemorrhaging red ink. This is
an issue of consequence to American readers because von Holtzbrinck
is the largest foreign owner of American book publishers, after
Germany's mammoth Bertelsmann conglomerate, which has had its own
difficulties with its sprawling Random House division.</TE>
<TE>   Its U.S. properties include Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, Henry Holt
and Co., St. Martin's and Picador USA. FS&amp;G, as it is called in
publishing circles, is arguably America's most distinguished literary
publisher. Since its founding by Roger W. Straus in 1947, it has
published the work of no fewer than 21 Nobel literature laureates.</TE>
<TE>   Though all four U.S. houses are healthy, their German parent may
not be quite so robust. Under a headline that roughly translates as
"A Horrific Doc," Der Spiegel alleges that von Holtzbrinck is
carrying a corporate debt of $1.2 billion, which exceeds its yearly
sales by more than 50%. The magazine also reports the group suffered
an operating loss of $46 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   Family spokesman Stefan von Holtzbrinck told European financial
news services that though the group's debt is "substantially below"
that reported in Der Spiegel, the firm nonetheless is planning to
sell television and radio properties. "We want to get out of these
areas," Von Holtzbrinck said. "We do not want to further increase our
debt. So it makes sense to sell off non-core assets."</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   Michael McClure has published 16 books of poetry, six collections
of essays, two novels and 10 plays, including "The Beard." He was one
of five Beat movement poets who participated in the seminal reading
at San Francisco's Six Gallery in 1955: "As ever, I'm working on a
new book of poems. At the moment, this sequence is so elaborate and
complex that I am hoping it will white itself out and ultimately
simplify in the reader's mind. This book involves taking from my
poems that already exist and using the parts as moments in space,
places from which I can move away from the direction in which I'm
moving now.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm also putting the journals I've kept since 1957 into
chronological order. Right now, it's a stack of paper 12 feet high
and out of it keep dropping drafts of full-length plays. Those I'm
rereading, revising and--in some cases--completing. It's a process
that began last year when I rewrote a play called "Red Snake." It's
based loosely on the last Jacobean revenge tragedy by John Sireley,
which was performed in 1641. I've added more blood and more murders.</TE>
<TE>   "My most urgent ongoing project, though, is a collaboration with
Ray Manzarek, the former keyboardist for the Doors. We've done more
than 175 performances together and have made two CDs. Our next gig
will be at the Los Angeles Central Library on July 14, Bastille Day.
I'll be reading, and Ray plays the piano at the same time I recite.
It's not accompaniment, but something collaborative, an extension of
the tradition that goes back to Kenneth Rexroth and his famous
reading with jazz at the Cellar. But what we do is more like Miles
Davis."</TE>

<HD>A Persian Kind of Pride</HD>
<DH>Young Iranian Americans are developing a passion for their
heritage and culture while maintaining a strong identity as U.S.
citizens</DH>

<LD>Sharon Sabet steps into a circle of dancers and lifts her tambourine
like a rising moon. Combing her hair, putting on her makeup, twirling
on her toes, she dances the part of a Persian princess in a sultan's
court. After class, she steps out of the rehearsal studio in West Los
Angeles and into her other life, as a dental student at UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   Sabet is a 22-year-old Iranian American whose parents were born in
the Middle East. Like a growing number of young Iranians in Los
Angeles, she is piecing together her cultural past, fitting it with
her present.</LD>
<LD>   For Sabet, dance classes with her Iranian-born instructor, Shida
Pegahi, have helped. "Persian dance isn't all that technical," Sabet
says. "It's more about the way you move. I discovered it's something
I have within me." Relating well to this part of her heritage makes
it easier for her to accept the aspects that aren't fitting together
so smoothly.</LD>
<TE>   "Sometimes I feel pulled in two directions," says Sabet, a native
Angeleno. "I grew up with Persian culture and my parents still have
their old views, from Iran. But I am here, living in American
culture."</TE>
<TE>   She and her family celebrate Persian New Year, Noruz, and she
speaks a bit of Persian with her relatives. Some of her
contemporaries are digging deeper. They are learning to be fluent in
classical Persian, studying the country's history and art, and
memorizing verses by the medieval poet Hafiz, whose books are
displayed like family heirlooms in Iran. Some are taking up the
santur, the stringed instrument whose soft twang is inseparable from
Persian music.</TE>
<TE>   One powerful magnet is on the UCLA campus, where the school's
Iranian Studies department includes courses about Iran as well as its
bordering countries. What started as a quiet lure for some in 1989,
with around 50 students enrolled, has turned into a strong tug. This
semester there are 400 students enrolled, all but a handful of whom
are of Middle Eastern descent.</TE>
<TE>   Bordering the UCLA campus, the streets of Westwood bustle with
Persian restaurants, gift shops, markets and music stores. Los
Angeles, in fact, has the largest Iranian community in the U.S. The
2000 census estimates there are nearly 277,000 Iranian immigrants in
this country, with more than a third of them in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Clouding the Iranian students' quest for cultural identity is the
poor relations the two countries share. President Bush recently
placed Iran and neighboring Iraq on an "axis of evil" with North
Korea because of their nuclear stockpiles. It's sometimes hard to
embrace fully a culture seen as "the enemy" and, as a result, young
Iranian Americans seem more than slightly removed from U.S.-Mideast
politics.</TE>
<TE>   Hossein Ziai, director of the UCLA program, came west in the
mid-'70s in a wave of Iranian college students. He expected to return
home after graduation, but the fall of Shah Reza Pahlavi's government
in 1979 and the rise of a fundamentalist stronghold changed his
plans.</TE>
<TE>   Ziai has seen a change in perspective from his generation of
Iranians to the generation of students he teaches. "American students
in general are manifestly less political than in my time," he says.
"And most of them consider themselves to be Americans. At the same
time, the Iranian community here is a new immigrant community.
Foremost in people's minds is how to succeed here. It is secondary to
try and change what goes on in Iran."</TE>
<TE>   Many of his students are majoring in science or business. "Some
tell me they are studying Persian language, or poetry, despite their
parents' nudging them to be a dentist or a pharmacist," Ziai says.
"Others tell me their parents have encouraged them to take at least
some courses in Iranian studies." A number of his science students
minor in Persian language, history or literature.</TE>
<TE>   Babak Roobini, who just graduated with a degree in neuroscience,
is applying to medical school at UCLA. As an undergraduate he took
seven courses about Iran with his science requirements. "I'd always
been very interested in the culture, the poetry and philosophical
texts, but I never had any vigorous courses until college," he says.
"I wanted to understand the culture that I am part of."</TE>
<TE>   Roobini was born in Iran but his family moved to California five
years ago, for greater academic freedom. Because they are Jewish, he
and his sister would not have been allowed to attend a good
university there. "There are restrictions for non-Muslims in Iran,"
he says. "Minorities don't qualify for the better schools."</TE>
<TE>   He keeps up with politics in his homeland but only as part of a
bigger picture. "Iranians get annoyed when the whole Middle East gets
lumped together," he says. "People need to understand the changes
that have taken place in that part of the world over the years."</TE>
<TE>   But his real interest is poetry. He writes verses in Persian and
also keeps up with the new Iranian movies that come to town. "I
haven't been through a big lifestyle change," he says about his
double identity. "It's been more of a spiritual and intellectual
journey. I want to understand and retain my heritage."</TE>
<TE>   Most of Roobini's contemporaries see themselves as Americans
first, while their parents keep the older ways alive for them.</TE>
<TE>   "In Southern California, in particular, this younger generation is
highly ethnic and proud of its identity," says Mehdi Bozorgmehr,
director of the Middle Eastern American Center in New York. "In other
cities with smaller Iranian populations, immigrants are much more
assimilated."</TE>
<TE>   Persian pride was evident at a recent poetry seminar at UCLA. Ten
students, only one of them with Western roots, made their final
presentations about the poetry of Mevlana Jalaluddin Rumi, the 13th
century mystic. They read his verses in Persian and translated them
on the spot.</TE>
<TE>   It was obvious that they felt a kinship with Rumi, the perpetual
student on a quest for eternal truths.</TE>
<TE>   With Rumi's poetry having been banned in Iran for more than 30
years, Ziai is restoring what he sees as an essential piece of an
Iranian's identity.</TE>
<TE>   "As a national trait, Persian poetic wisdom informs everything
about the culture," he says, "from the mundane to the spiritual. If
students know the literature and culture, they become increasingly
involved in the essence of their heritage."</TE>

<LD>The circus music became louder, but still no one came out of the
houses to see what was going on. Brian, Heather and Alexandra were
the only people who stood on the sidewalk watching the circus parade
approach.</LD>
<LD>   Leading the parade was a big man wearing a red suit and a black
top hat. He rode an enormous white horse that had pink and blue
ribbons tied in its long mane and tail.</LD>
<LD>   Behind him was a big pipe organ on wheels played by a clown.
Behind the pipe organ was an elephant led by a man dressed in a long
white cloak and a turban with a big red jewel in front. On the
elephant's back was a small house draped in silk. Men and women in
colorful tights waved from floats decorated with ribbons and flags.</LD>
<TE>   The kids were astonished when the man on the big white horse
stopped in front of them. He waved his hat in the air. "How-dee-do,"
he called out. "I am Major Pimm, ringmaster of the Marvel-of-the-Age
Circus."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm Brian, and this is Heather and Alexandra."</TE>
<TE>   "Of course you are," Major Pimm agreed, and laughed. "Do you have
your tickets?"</TE>
<TE>   "No," Heather said. "All we have are these magic sticks."</TE>
<TE>   "Those will do," Major Pimm said. "Come on up." He gestured with
one hand and a rope ladder unrolled from the house on the elephant's
back.</TE>
<TE>   Brian and Heather gave Major Pimm their sticks and climbed the
ladder into the little house atop the elephant. Before Alexandra
could follow, a beautiful lady in spangled tights led her away.</TE>
<TE>   Major Pimm laughed. "She'll be fine," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Brian and Heather could see Alexandra, already wearing purple
tights, climbing aboard the float with the acrobats and aerialists.</TE>
<TE>   "She'll be fine," Brian agreed. He and Heather each settled down
in a nest of comfortable cushions.</TE>
<TE>   "Onward," Major Pimm cried, and the parade continued.</TE>

<LD>These Sloppy Joes are made with ground turkey instead of hamburger.
If you're serving them at a backyard party, they'll be sure to please
those looking for something lighter among the big burgers, heavy
salads and rich desserts.</LD>
<LD>   Keep the calories down, too, by using small hamburger buns, not
kaiser rolls or oversized buns. Each bun holds about one-half cup of
filling--not too sloppy.</LD>
<LD>   The filling can be made a day ahead and reheated. Just grill the
buns at the last minute; spray them with nonstick cooking spray or
lightly brush them with oil before placing them on the grill.</LD>

<LD>The Huntington Beach farmers market enjoys the most beautiful
location of any market in the Southland--right along the beach. It's
a colorful scene in summer as tourists and surfers looking for a
snack rub shoulders with local homemakers.</LD>
<LD>   Vegetables are the market's strong suit. Sean Sullivan, a young
organic grower from Valley Center, north of Escondido, has gorgeous
chartreuse tomatillos encased in parchment-like husks, begging to be
pureed into salsa verde with onion, garlic, cilantro and hot pepper,
all available at the market. This Friday, Sullivan says, he'll bring
his first tomatoes, including flavorful Brandywine and Moskvich, a
Siberian heirloom.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Almond, who calls himself "Farmer Mike," brings fresh
romaine, red oak and greenleaf lettuces, along with arugula, spinach
and leeks, all grown under the power lines in north Long Beach.</LD>
<TE>   Tanaka Farms of Irvine sells gold and green zucchini, mild Anaheim
hot peppers and small heads of broccoflower, a greenish form of
cauliflower (not, as the name and popular wisdom would have it, a
hybrid with broccoli) with a nubbly texture and nutty flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Valdivia Farms of Carlsbad offers Romano flat beans and their
gorgeously speckled cousins, Dragon Tongue beans, which taste
similar, though they lose their dramatic violet splashes when cooked.
Smith Farms of Irvine and Fountain Valley has nice snow peas, grape
tomatoes and jalapenos, along with sweet organic cantaloupes.</TE>
<TE>   The market lacks top-notch stone-fruit vendors; it's hard to
persuade the best growers from the Central Valley to fight the
traffic into Orange County, says market manager Jennifer Griffiths.
The Yasukochi stand, however, has tender, sweet Chandler strawberries
from Oceanside, as well as pretty good raspberries.</TE>

<LD>The sweet, tart and spicy dressing for this shrimp and avocado salad
is a pick-me-up on a hot day, while the herbs in it are soothing.
It's a good salad for summer meals.</LD>
<LD>   Buy shrimp that's already cooked and peeled (or lobster, if you're
feeling flush) or use leftover chunks of home-cooked halibut or other
firm fish.</LD>
<LD>   All that's left to do is cut up the vegetables and tear the
greens.</LD>
<TE>   For added flavor and color, try opal or Thai basil, which you can

<LD>Cafe Pinot, next to the downtown Los Angeles library, is a beautiful
place to eat. But if you don't have time to lounge on its patio,
order from the takeout window. Try the grilled salmon salad, perfect
for warm weather. It consists of a nicely sized salmon filet with
mixed greens, a container of vinaigrette dressing and a slice of
ciabatta bread with butter neatly packed to go. Each day, there's a
different soup. The day we picked up the salmon, it was corn and
potato bisque with mushrooms and applewood-smoked bacon.</LD>

<HD>Wine of the Week</HD>
<DH>1999 E. Guigal Cote-Rotie "Brune et Blonde," Rhone Valley,
France.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Cote-Rotie, the famous "roasted slope" of the northern Rhone,
Marcel Guigal is the master. His stunning single-vineyard
Cote-Roties--La Mouline, La Landonne and La Turque--are snatched up
as soon as they're released, and at breathtaking prices.</LD>
<LD>   But his blended Cote-Rotie, which goes by the name Brune et
Blonde, shouldn't be overlooked. The 1999 is one of the best Syrahs
Guigal has ever made, and in a great vintage like this one, that's
saying a lot.</LD>
<LD>   Cool and smoky, brilliant ruby in color, it has a gorgeous nose, a
taste of dark plums and a smooth, silky texture. In other words, this
is a wine with undeniable elegance. And for just over $30, it would
be hard to find a better red from the northern Rhone.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike Guigal's single-vineyard wines, Brune et Blonde is
available in quantity. You can even find it in half bottles.</TE>
<TE>   About $34. Widely available at fine wine shops and retailers.</TE>

<LD>What's in a cola? Once upon a time, it was the seeds of Cola
acuminata, a 65-foot tall West African tree in the same family as the
cacao plant.</LD>
<LD>   Cola seeds, which can be more than an inch long and weigh up to
half an ounce, are bitter because they contain tannin and caffeine.
Conveniently, the bitter taste gradually disappears because of the
action of ptyaline, the enzyme in saliva that breaks starches into
sugars.</LD>
<LD>   In West Africa, cola seeds are chewed to ease hunger and give
energy, which they do--they have a stimulant effect with few
secondary effects. That's why cola seeds were used in cola drinks,
because colas were originally marketed as pick-me-ups. Cola also has
the property of making anything tasted after it taste sweeter.</LD>
<TE>   Cola drinks once were served hot, like coffee or cocoa. But like
the coca leaves that once went into one well-known cola, cola seeds
now are scarcely used.</TE>

<HD>The Goat Cheese Divas</HD>
<DH>Thank a small group of California women for one of the true
gifts of summer</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY GREEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laura Chenel, the Sonoma cheese maker, introduced California to
fresh, French-style goat cheeses more than 20 years ago. But hundreds
of years of French farmhouse tradition was not mastered overnight. To
this day, these delicate cheeses refuse to conform to modern
supermarket culture.</LD>
<LD>   The luscious little pots of loose fromage blanc, the barely formed
logs of chevre, the pucks and the pyramids retain their old-world
characteristics. They remain as moody and perishable as fruit.
Trickiest, they are stubbornly seasonal. They are never better than
the time when goat keepers are catching and converting the flush of
milk that follows spring kidding.</LD>
<LD>   In other words, that season is now.</LD>
<TE>   Learn about the seasonality of goat cheese, and so much else falls
into place. It explains why the youngest, freshest ones, the cream
cheeses and chevres, are traditionally partnered with the sweetest
and ripest of summer berries. That's why the aged ones come wrapped
in fig and grape leaves. That explains the marriage with walnuts.
That explains the herb coatings, the goat cheese salads, the
crostini.</TE>
<TE>   These goat cheeses follow roughly the same range of styles of
French cow milk cheeses, but the similarities end there. They will
never match the richness of a double cream brie, or have the aging
life of a mature Cheddar or Parmesan. But they have a summery charm
all their own, a unique lightness, a subtle tang, an elegance that
seems to trip along the palate an entire register above the flavors
and textures of cow milk cheeses.</TE>
<TE>   The explanation lies less in the cheese-making and more in the
milk. Goat milk and cow milk are composed differently, says John
Bruhn, director of the Dairy Research and Information Center at UC
Davis. "The milk-fat globule in goat milk is more susceptible to
breaking apart," explains Bruhn. "In goat milk, if you agitate it,
you can get a flavor change. That also occurs with cow's milk, but
it's not as pronounced."</TE>
<TE>   Goat milk not only handles differently, it looks different, says
Brandon Nelson, a food science lecturer at Cornell University. While
cow milk cheeses are a buttery yellow, goat cheese is almost
startlingly white. "In the goat, a lot of the carotene is converted
to vitamin A," Nelson says, "so it has a very white milk and you get
a glistening white chevre."</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years into a steep learning curve with this shimmering,
delicate milk, a network of Californian goat cheese makers stretching
from Ojai to the Oregon border are just mastering how to make cheese
from it. The most endearing thing about them, says UC Davis' Bruhn,
is that they happened into it accidentally. "A lot of the people got
goats because they liked them," he says. "Suddenly they had milk, and
more goats, and they said, 'What can I do with this?' "</TE>
<TE>   If fromage de chevre was still an exotic curiosity when this bunch
got their goats in the late 1970s, goat milk wasn't. From the 1940s,
the Central Valley had at least two dozen goat dairies. Big ones.
Laurelwood Acres Dairy in Ripon had more than 1,000 goats in the
1950s and funneled the milk to a health food industry. It even had
salesmen door-stepping doctors trying to get them to prescribe the
milk as baby food.</TE>
<TE>   Pinky Hawes' father started Laurelwood Acres after she was born
allergic to cow milk. It saved lives, including hers, she believes,
but the slightly burnt flavor during evaporation or
ultra-pasteurization also gave the milk a reputation as a hard pill
to swallow. However, the public loved the goats. They were the
biggest draws at county fairs and 4-H shows, says Hawes.</TE>
<TE>   "The Nubians with long ears, they were always the most popular
because people thought they looked like dogs," she says. Hawes first
spotted one of the early cheese-makers in a 4-H.</TE>
<TE>   It was Jennifer Bice who arrived in Sonoma County from Los Angeles
in the 1960s as a 10-year-old and was desperate to have farm animals.
She immediately joined 4-H and started showing goats in fairs judged
by Hawes. "We wanted cows, pigs and ducks," says Bice. "It was the
goats that stuck."</TE>
<TE>   By the 1970s, Bice was engaged to Steven Schack, an Angeleno who
majored in psychology at Sonoma State University. "While he was
studying, he got a few goats," recalls Bice. Once married, Bice and
Schack took over her parents' farm in Sebastopol, formed Redwood Hill
goat dairy and produced goat milk for the health food market. By the
1980s, they graduated to yogurt, and in the 1990s, to cheese.</TE>
<TE>   Switzerland in Sonoma</TE>
<TE>   Today, Redwood Hill could scarcely be more European in style. In
fact, it feels distinctly Swiss. Laid out over a series of ledges
down a Sonoma County hillside, goats caper in a series of parallel
pens. Goats are kept in age groups, kind of like grades in schools.
No prize for spotting the kid pen. That's the one with all the goats
vying for control of the top of haystacks set out for them to climb.
They have access to outdoors at all times. As pedigree breeding
stock, they tend to have names like racehorses, say Redwood Hill
Sequoia Selena.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to believe that there are 400 of these blueblood goats
around. But there are. The fresh air and easy conditions remind
visitors of another difference between goat dairies and so many huge
cow ones.</TE>
<TE>   Bice employs European staff, students from agricultural colleges
over on work-study programs. During evening milking, Sebastien, a
Frenchman, and Henri, a Dane, clip the hoofs of a half a dozen goats
as the animals are milked. The parlor has drowsy twilight charm.
Goats lazily chew grain as the pump whooshes at the same rhythm as a
not quite sated kid would suckle. The scent of fresh milk suffuses
the place. It is pumped next door, to a cheese room, where after
being pasteurized, it will be curdled by the addition of a lactic
bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   Whey, the water part of the milk carrying much of the lactose,
will then be drained, leaving loose fresh curds. This will be ladled
into molds, allowed to drain some more, then fashioned into a number
of cheeses.</TE>
<TE>   Redwood Hill's cheeses include a white log of young chevre, a
spreading cheese. The same basic cheese, formed in a disc-shaped
mold, might be coated with pepper or herbs and sold in discs. Then
there are the more mature cheeses with bloomy Camembert-style rinds.</TE>
<TE>   Schack introduced these cheeses locally by selling them at farmers
markets about 10 years ago, but he died suddenly three years ago.
Mostly it is now sold through high-end supermarkets and specialty
shops, However, in Los Angeles, at Santa Monica farmers market,
Schack's parents sell Redwood Hill cheeses to a faithful crowd of
French expatriates most Wednesdays.</TE>
<TE>   Let Them Eat Chevre</TE>
<TE>   If Bice and Schack led their generation into goat breeding, Laura
Chenel, a neighbor of Bice's from Sebastopol pioneered the
cheese-making in California. After studying anthropology at UC Santa
Cruz and Berkeley, and acquiring goats along the way (as one did),
Chenel found herself with milk, and began making cheese in her
kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   By 1979, she had gone to France, to the Loire and Burgundy, to
study French farmhouse cheese-making. Here she saw goat cheese
hand-made as it had been for centuries. The milk was curdled by
adding some of the previous day's whey. Barely formed, unsalted curds
were then brought to the table in special perforated drainers set in
pitchers, called faisselles. This brand-new cheese was then either
topped with fresh berries, or salted and peppered and consumed with
wine.</TE>
<TE>   For the older cheeses, the ones drained in little perforated molds
shaped like pyramids and pucks, then salted and left to age for a
month, tradition left it to the molds impregnated in the environment
to culture the cheeses, and form the bloomy rinds. This mold,
observed Chenel, would begin to ripen the newly coagulated and
drained cheese from the outside in. The process, called
"mold-ripening," could then be subtly manipulated to create different
styles of cheeses. Shapes would affect texture, hence the variety of
pyramids, molehills and pucks.</TE>
<TE>   The addition of ash would create yet another kind of cheese. The
ash from rosemary branches burnt in farmyard kettles would be applied
to the rinds to temper the acidity. The resulting ash-coated cheeses
not only looked different, but matured differently and tasted
different.</TE>
<TE>   But these ancient processes could not be imported without updating
them. Even farmhouse French cheese makers at the time were turning to
new, more sterile, methods. Old whey, says Chenel, transmitted
contaminants as effectively as it did the good bugs. A modern method
involved adding lactic bacteria bought from a pharmaceutical company.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., cheese-aging rooms had to be kept sterile. Mold
cultures, the most typical being Penicillium candidum, were bought
and applied in modern, controlled circumstances. Rosemary twig ash
was replaced by deactivated charcoal purchased from medical supply
companies.</TE>
<TE>   After adapting the recipes in the U.S., Chenel formed Laura
Chenel's Chevre in 1981. Chenel developed a specialty line that
included fresh cheeses in olive oil, fresh logs of the spreadable
chevre and the mold-ripened discs, ash-coated variants. There were
also the hard, aged shepherds cheeses that goat farmers made to
endure long trips or to see them through winter milk shortages.</TE>
<TE>   None of the cheeses were well-known in America. They didn't travel
well. Cheese makers compare them to fruit, because they keep
ripening. If San Franciscans had tasted imported versions of these
perishable cheeses before Chenel adapted the recipes for California,
the chances were good that the "fruit" was rotten.</TE>
<TE>   The appearance of Chenel's local, fresh cheeses created a
sensation, one captured in the 1982 "Chez Panisse Menu Cookbook,"
which contained nine goat cheese recipes--everything from the now
classic baked goat cheese with garden salad to chevre with baked
garlic and peasant bread.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Chenel's business had grown so much, she took over a
large cow dairy on the Napa-Sonoma border. There she keeps a herd of
500 goats and runs a dairy that imports additional milk from all over
the state. The success was considered unseemly by some of the
original 1970s Bay Area goat set. But fellow pioneer Chris Twohy
brushes the grumblings aside. "As far as I'm concerned, she deserves
tremendous credit for popularizing goat's cheese," he says. "I'm a
fan."</TE>
<TE>   A New World Shepherd</TE>
<TE>   Twohy also got a goat in college. Raised in suburban Palo Alto, he
did a turn at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, "got the ecology bug" and
transferred to UC Davis to study renewable natural resources and crop
science. "I didn't have any money, I didn't have any land, so I got a
goat," he says. "I got kicked out of town because I was keeping a
goat in my yard."</TE>
<TE>   After a brief time in Sebastopol, Twohy and his wife, Jan, moved
north to Lakeport, a remote farm east of Ukiah in the mountains of
Lake County. There they became old-fashioned subsistence farmers,
even growing their own hay. They built their own house at the edge of
an old walnut grove, equipped with the named the Yerba Santa Dairy,
and assembled a herd of 65 goats.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from buying in the odd pedigree buck, they now keep a gritty
herd of crossbreeds, which they run on the hillside chaparral. The
goats come back for milking, he says, along with "love and hay."</TE>
<TE>   Originally, their milk went to the health food industry and to
Chenel's cheese business. But in the early 1980s, Jan began making
cheese, which Chris takes to three local farmers markets and sells by
mail order. Far and away the best of these is an aged, hard cheese
called Alpine Shepherd.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the fresh and mold-ripened discs, rennet is added to the
milk for this cheese. It causes a stronger contraction of the milk
proteins, creating a tighter curd, which will then be cut to release
the water, bagged, drained, pressed and aged for as long as 10 months
to create a dry, hard wheel. It does not want to age much longer,
says Twohy.</TE>
<TE>   The finished cheese is poignantly rustic, with imprints of knotted
cheese visible in the sides. Inside, it has the granular texture of
an aged parmesan. The flavor is nutty, strange, delicious and ideal
for grating over asparagus.</TE>
<TE>   Rare and Perfect</TE>
<TE>   Though the Twohys are the most old-fashioned of the California
goat cheese makers, their operation is not the smallest. That
distinction goes to Rex and Barbara Backus, transplanted Angelenos
who moved to Napa in 1972, and bought their first goats from
then-19-year-old Jennifer Bice. Ten years ago, Barbara Backus opened
a tiny licensed cheese plant next to the house and named it Goat's
Leap.</TE>
<TE>   Bice praises Barbara Backus as the most fastidious, analytical and
eerily talented of the California goat cheese makers. Others call her
a perfectionist, by which they mean "prickly." It takes eating rival
versions of the same sort of cheeses that she makes to appreciate her
touch.</TE>
<TE>   Backus' mold-ripened Goat's Leap cheeses are small, perfectly
formed, and sold by a handful of retailers. Backus doesn't make
enough cheese to lose track of it, and risk the fate of so many
carelessly handled farmhouse cheeses: left to rot in open display
cases.</TE>
<TE>   Large dairies can and do stagger breeding to keep milk flowing and
cheese production going year round. But getting out to kidding pens
in the middle of the night and maintaining the generational divides
so important for managing classes of goats becomes so difficult that
goat milk production typically falls off by 50% in the winter. The
Backuses, like the Twohys, don't even try to produce winter milk, and
let their goats go dry in November and December. "People said 'Oh,
your customers will forget you,' " says Backus. "The opposite
happened."</TE>
<TE>   Another of the pioneers is Mary Keehn, whose operation in
McKinleyville is so far north, it's practically in Oregon. She caught
her first goat in the 1970s from a semiwild herd kept by her landlord
to keep scrub down around a dairy farm. "That was Hazel," she says,
her voice warming as she recalls the name of her first goat.</TE>
<TE>   After Hazel, Keehn was hooked. She went into goat breeding, then
showing and in 1983, opened a cheese plant, Cypress Grove Chevre. The
signature cheese of this dairy is the ash-coated Humboldt Fog. The
idea for the cheese occurred to Keehn on the airplane home from a
trip visiting goat dairies in Provence.</TE>
<TE>   In the course of developing the business, she sold her goats and
began buying in the milk from five local goat dairies. She is about
to move to a new farm, buy a herd of goats and expand into an
operation along the lines of Chenel and Redwood Hill.</TE>
<TE>   The Goats of Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   Fittingly enough, in Los Angeles, the goat milk commutes between
goat dairy and cheese making room, a freeway ride between Chino and
Ojai. It was not always thus. In the mid-1990s, Emily Thomson was an
Ojai market gardener growing fancy salad greens. But the lettuce and
herbs were phased out after she spotted a herd of goats near her
farm.</TE>
<TE>   She began carrying milk up the road 10-gallon cans to experiment
with cheese-making. She then "read every manual" she could find,
designed and built a cheese plant, and began making strictly
simplest, most voluptuous of fresh cheeses, fromage blanc, fresh
chevre, chevre with pepper corns, yet another with Provencal herbs.</TE>
<TE>   Her customers included Campanile chef Mark Peel. Eventually, she
got her own goats, which she boarded at a Chino dairy, and arranged
to have the milk shipped to her. But two years ago, tricky logistics
and lease problems abruptly shut the business. Then just as suddenly,
two months ago, she reopened the plant with a new partner, Alan
Clammer, and reappeared in farmers markets, again with those
quivering fresh chevres.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to move to aged cheeses," Thomson says. That seems to be
the typical course goat cheese-makers take. However, one can only
hope that she does not leave the fresh ones behind. She not is only
Southern California's only artisanal chevre maker; she is also the
only one in the state with the energy and commitment to make this
simplest, freshest cheeses, then to rush them to market every week.</TE>
<TE>   How Thomson will fare when the summer and autumn milk begins to
dry up, and whether her cheese will remain in markets, is unclear.
She's had supply problems in the past, she says. Chino dairyman
Johnnie de Yong says that she's his "No. 2 priority," after supplying
milk to Trader Joe's, but warns that he has "seasonal problems like
everyone else."</TE>
<TE>   A good selection of respectable chevres will still be in stores in
the winter, including Redwood Hill's and Chenel's. But they will be
different than summer cheese, says Redwood Hill's Jennifer Bice. At
least some of it, possibly a lot of it, will be made from frozen
curd.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wants to admit using frozen curd," says Bice. "We try to
only make fresh chevre. But to get through the winter, we do freeze
some and we do mix fresh and frozen together. The flavor is not
tremendously affected. The thing that does happen is it's a drier
more crumbly cheese. Fresh chevre is very spreadable, very creamy. A
frozen chevre product is going to be drier and crumbly."</TE>
<TE>   Freezing curd is not a California aberration. The French do it. It
can produce a very decent cheese, just not those famously delicate
ones. It is intended only to tide us over until the next summer when
the figs are ripening, kids are suckling and the California is once
again flush with summer milk.</TE>

<LD>In France, chevre simply means goat cheese. In the United States,
terms are different. Here is a buyer's guide.</LD>
<LD>   Chevre: Fresh goat cheese, drained to a soft, spreadable state,
then sold loose in pots or rolled into logs. Sold in farmers markets
at anywhere from a day to a week old. Perfect for spreading on a
bagel or crostini. Supermarket versions will be older and drier.
These are fine on bread or crumbled in salad, but they are excellent
cooking cheeses that fluff up wonderfully and release the lactic
perfume in an omelet or souffle.</LD>
<LD>   Fresh chevre also comes shaped in discs and coated with cracked
pepper or herbs.</LD>
<TE>   Chevre from a farmers market should be treated like fruit: Buy
small amounts and eat promptly. Always ask for a taste: It should be
milky, bright and delicate.</TE>
<TE>   Supermarket logs should be eaten within a week. Check the sell-by
date, and beware of watery whey collecting in the plastic packaging.
This signifies refrigeration failure or poor draining. Both mean a
rank cheese.</TE>
<TE>   Crottin: Made with buttery milk and mold-ripened from six weeks to
three months. The inside, called the "pate," is smooth and glistening
white. The rind-ripening will impart a sophisticated, earthy flavor,
but the overall taste will be delicate.</TE>
<TE>   The traditional way to serve it is oiled, rolled in bread crumbs,
then baked for five to 10 minutes before being set in sharply dressed
salads of peppery greens. Judge its ripeness as you would a
camembert: It shouldn't feel rock-hard or completely soft--more like
a well-toned stomach.</TE>
<TE>   Goat feta: A fresh Greek-style cheese preserved in brine. The salt
leaches the water from the cheese, which is dry and crumbly. Best in
salad with plenty of olive oil.</TE>
<TE>   Goat fromage blanc: This cream cheese consists of barely curdled
milk that has been only lightly drained and remains unsalted. It is a
rare pleasure to find it fresh, when it should taste like an adult
version of milk, with the sweetness siphoned off, but a light milky
flavor still intact. Perfect for desserts. A slight tang enlivens
summer berries.</TE>
<TE>   Marinated goat cheese: Fresh cheeses suspended in olive oil, often
infused with rosemary. Perfect for spreading on toast or tossing in
salads.</TE>
<TE>   Tome, tomme, shepherd cheeses and Cheddar: Cheeses that have been
made with rennet, then drained, dried and aged to become a hard or
semihard cheese. Traditionally, a way of preserving summer milk
throughout the winter. If the nutty and herbaceous notes are not
immediate when the cheese is eaten cold, try melting it on toast and
the perfume will rise.</TE>

<TE>   Goat Cheese Souffle</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 40 minutes
* Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   Mark Peel, chef at Campanile, didn't miss a beat when asked for a
goat cheese recipe. "Why don't you do a goat cheese souffle?" he
asked. "It's delicious." This version comes from the cookbook "Mark
Peel and Nancy Silverton at Home" (Warner Books, 1994). The recipe
calls for Montrachet goat cheese, a chevre-style cheese wrapped in a
chestnut or grape leaf. A commercial log of chevre from the
supermarket will do nicely. In two different tests, the souffle made
with Emily Thomson's looser, fresher cheese had a 10-minute longer
baking time than a second souffle made with denser commercial chevre.
Depending on the cheese you use, adjust your baking time accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups milk</TE>
<TE>   3 cloves garlic</TE>
<TE>   3 sprigs fresh marjoram</TE>
<TE>   6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, plus more for preparing

<TE>   6 tablespoons flour</TE>
<TE>   3/4 pound goat cheese, divided</TE>
<TE>   Coarse salt</TE>
<TE>   4 eggs, separated</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon chopped fresh marjoram</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   Heat the milk in a small saucepan with the garlic and marjoram
sprigs and bring just to a boil. Turn off the heat and allow to steep
for 10 minutes. Remove and discard the garlic and marjoram.</TE>
<TE>   Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat and whisk in the
flour. Cook over low heat, stirring, 2 to 3 minutes. Slowly whisk in
the warm milk and stir until very smooth. Crumble in two-thirds of
the cheese and whisk until incorporated. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon of
salt. Set aside to cool to room temperature.</TE>
<TE>   Stir in the egg yolks.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Liberally butter a 2-quart
straight-sided shallow baking pan or gratin dish.</TE>
<TE>   Beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they hold soft
peaks. Do not beat until dry. Thoroughly fold a quarter of the whites
into the cheese mixture. Sprinkle in the chopped marjoram and pepper,
stir to combine and fold in the remaining whites. Pour into the dish.
Dot with the remaining cheese.</TE>
<TE>   Place in the center of the oven. Bake until the top is puffed and

<TE>   "This is an easy one," says Mark Peel. "It involves almost no
cooking, except for toasting some walnuts. If you're talking about
summertime outdoor dining, put some of this in a pot with grilled
bread alongside some sliced tomatoes." Add another tablespoon of
olive oil if walnut oil isn't available.</TE>
<TE>   1 pound chevre</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   2/3 cup walnuts</TE>

<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 sourdough baguette</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Place the chevre in a bowl and allow to soften at room temperature
for 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, toast the walnuts on a baking sheet until lightly
browned, stirring once or twice, about 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool, then
roughly chop. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly add the cream to the cheese while stirring with a rubber
spatula until the mixture has thinned to a spreadable consistency.
Add the nuts, thyme, walnut oil, 2 tablespoons of olive oil and salt
and pepper to taste.</TE>
<TE>   Slice the baguette on the bias into slices 1/4 inch thick. Lay
them on a baking sheet and dab each lightly with the remaining 2

<TE>   Stuffed Peach and Raspberry Sauce</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 20 minutes</TE>
<TE>   This recipe comes from Laura Chenel's 1990 book, "Chevre!" It is
summer on a dessert plate. Chenel loved the combination of textures.</TE>
<TE>   1 pint fresh raspberries (1 1/4 cups)</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons sugar, or to taste</TE>
<TE>   3 ripe peaches (about 1 pound)</TE>
<TE>   5 ounces fresh loose chevre or drained fromage blanc</TE>
<TE>   6 amaretti cookies, crumbled, or 1/4 cup sliced toasted almonds,
ground</TE>
<TE>   Press the raspberries through a sieve using a large spoon or
rubber spatula. Combine with the sugar.</TE>
<TE>   Halve and pit the peaches. Set them in a baking dish. Divide the
cheese into 6 portions, roll each into a ball and roll in the cookie
crumbs or almonds until well coated. Place a cheese ball into the pit
section of each peach half, carefully arranging the peaches so they
won't fall over.</TE>

<AU>BARBARA HANSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Deborah Madison is known for great vegetarian cookbooks, beginning
with the landmark "Greens Cookbook," which she wrote in 1987 as the
founding chef of Greens Restaurant in San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   Clearly this is a woman who knows her produce. Madison's new book,
"Local Flavors" (Broadway Books: $39.95), is based on her study of
farmers markets across the country and her experiences running one in
Santa Fe, N.M., where she lives.</LD>
<LD>   What may surprise Madison's fans is that this is not a vegetarian
book. It includes a few meat and seafood recipes because some farmers
markets sell these products and because, as Madison says of her own
meat-eating at the end of her introduction, "I do enjoy it
occasionally."</LD>
<TE>   Still, the focus is fresh, seasonal produce, and Madison rightly
praises the way growers have enhanced our tables with quality produce
and uncommon varieties. "This is food that tastes so good that little
has to be done to it in the kitchen," she writes, and proves her
approach with recipes that tend toward simplicity. The idea is to
enhance natural, fresh flavors.</TE>
<TE>   But sometimes that good philosophy leads to frustration in the
kitchen. Some dishes have less flavor than one expects. And some of
the recipes call for produce that is so specialized that even readers
who shop at farmers markets may not find it. Supermarket shoppers
will surely have to substitute, which defeats the book's purpose, or
else stick to the dishes with common ingredients.</TE>
<TE>   Madison's recipes meander through the seasons and through produce
groups without any rigid order. Soups, salads, pizza, pasta and
seared, roasted and braised vegetables are lumped together in the
first chapter, on greens.</TE>
<TE>   Five recipes, tested at random, yielded mixed results. An
upside-down cake topped with dried fruits was a real winner, the sort
of recipe you make again and again. Moist and buttery with perfectly
tender fruit, it would be a wonderful Thanksgiving dessert--but is
hard to resist even in summer.</TE>
<TE>   Roasted peppers and tomatoes baked with herbs and capers was
beautiful but bland. Roasted asparagus with citrus butter was another
timid dish, but it looked stunning on the plate when made with blood
oranges, as Madison suggests.</TE>
<TE>   The recipe for braised broccoli with olives lacked clarity. Just
what are "small heads" of broccoli? Individual stalks? A bunch? The
recipe calls for an onion that is sauteed with chopped garlic and
marjoram. One assumes that the onion is chopped first. Making
educated guesses produced a good dish, nevertheless.</TE>
<TE>   Corn pudding was handsome to look at, but it curdled as it baked
and was too crumbly and dry to be called a pudding. It needed less
cooking time than the recipe specified. (This was true also of the
upside-down cake. One wonders if these dishes were tested at Santa
Fe's high altitude and therefore required more cooking time than at
sea level in Los Angeles.)</TE>
<TE>   The beautiful photographs and compelling discoveries make you want
to follow in Madison's footsteps. But she never lists the markets she
visited, and only loosely connects some of the recipes to those she
does mention.</TE>
<TE>   These fresh, folksy markets supplied the format for the book, but
where exactly are they, and when do they take place?</TE>
<TE>   On the last page, Madison mentions a USDA directory for farmers
markets, but where is her own personalized guide?</TE>
<TE>   Madison has avid fans, and justly so. But this book may disappoint
even some of them.</TE>

<TE>   Upside-Down Cake With Mixed Dried Fruits</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   This is a wonderfully delicate, buttery cake that is worth making
even during the height of the summer fruit season, but will be
especially welcome during the winter months. The Times Test Kitchen
used a mixture of dried apricots, cherries and plums.</TE>
<TE>   FRUIT AND TOPPING</TE>
<TE>   2 1/3 cups dried fruits</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons unsalted butter</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup light brown sugar, packed</TE>
<TE>   Place the fruit in a saucepan, cover with water and bring to a
boil. Simmer, partially covered, until the fruit is plump and soft,
about 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Melt the butter in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet, then whisk in the
sugar. When it has melted, turn off the heat and allow the syrup to
settle evenly over the bottom. Arrange the fruits attractively over
the top, the cut sides facing up. If some pieces are very large, you
might cut them into halves or quarters so that the cake will be easy
to slice.</TE>
<TE>   CAKE</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon almond extract</TE>
<TE>   2 eggs, at room temperature</TE>
<TE>   1 cup buttermilk</TE>
<TE>   1 3/4 cups flour</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon baking soda</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon baking powder</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon sea salt</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Beat the butter with the sugar until light and fluffy, then add
the vanilla and almond extracts and the eggs, one at a time, and beat
until thoroughly smooth. Scrape down the bowl between additions, then
add the buttermilk.</TE>
<TE>   In another bowl, sift or whisk the flour, baking soda, baking
powder and salt together so that they are combined evenly. With the
mixer on low, add them to the batter in 3 or 4 separate additions.</TE>
<TE>   Spoon the batter over the fruit, then bake in the center of the
oven until the cake is golden and starting to pull away from the
sides, about 25 to 35 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes, then place a
serving plate over the skillet, grasp both together, and flip them
over. Remove the skillet. Serve while still a bit warm or when fully
cooled.</TE>

<HD>Solved: The Great Zinfandel Mystery</HD>
<DH>The birthplace of California's signature grape turns out to
be Croatia</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROD SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the biggest mysteries in the wine world appears to be solved.
A UC Davis plant geneticist has confirmed the Old World origin of
Zinfandel--and it's not Italy.</LD>
<LD>   "Zinfandel comes from Croatia," says Carole Meredith. "The grape
we call Zinfandel, and the grape the Italians call Primitivo, are
both Crljenak Kastelanski."</LD>
<LD>   That's Crljenak Kastelanski: pronounced tsurl-YEN-ahk
kahstel-AHN-ski. Its discovery answers a question that has fascinated
wine lovers and scientists for more than 100 years: Where did
California's signature wine grape come from?</LD>
<TE>   Meredith's research culminates a 35-year search by two generations
of scientists facing nearly impossible odds. With more than 10,000
grape varieties in the world, locating Zinfandel's Old World source
was like finding the proverbial needle in the haystack. In fact,
Crljenak is a forgotten variety in its homeland, Dalmatia, and the
more than 1,000 islands off its coast in the Adriatic Sea. So far,
Meredith and her team have found only 20 Crljenak vines, planted
among other grapes in three locations.</TE>
<TE>   But 20 vines is enough to rescue the original Zin from
oblivion--and that's important well beyond the satisfaction of
establishing Zinfandel's pedigree. Aside from giving Zin new
legitimacy among the wine world's leafy aristocrats, the discovery
closes the genetic gap between modern California Zinfandel vines and
their ancient forerunners. Who knows what sensory delights await Zin
lovers once the old Croatian clones become part of the California
vineyard mix?</TE>
<TE>   When Meredith revealed her finding casually to friends and
colleagues this spring, the news electrified the wine world. She will
formally present her discovery in August at a grape genetics
conference in Hungary. She is also working on a paper to be published
early next year in the Journal of Enology and Viticulture.</TE>
<TE>   The quest to solve the mystery of the Mystery Grape is a
scientific whodunit with a diverse cast of characters. When Meredith
became the chief detective on the case in 1991, it had already been
in progress for decades. UC Davis professor Austin Goheen and
graduate student Wade Wolfe laid the groundwork in the 1960s and
'70s. The legendary Napa Valley vintner Miljenko "Mike" Grgich, a
native Croatian, was a key informant. The investigative team included
scientists, historians, grape growers and students in California,
Italy and Croatia.</TE>
<TE>   Serendipity played a part, too. One of the most important
contributions was made by a Croatian student at UC Davis. Jasenka
Piljac was a dishwasher in Meredith's laboratory in the early '90s.
After graduating from Davis and returning to Zagreb, Piljac served as
translator and research assistant during Meredith's 1998 sleuthing
mission. "The timing worked out very well," says Meredith. "I would
not have been able to do it without her. And that's an example of the
almost eerie way things have fallen into place on this quest."</TE>
<TE>   The mystery of Zinfandel has haunted wine lovers and
viticulturists for more than a century. Unlike every other fine wine
grape in the state, Zin apparently had no European homeland. Cabernet
came from Bordeaux, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir from Burgundy. But for
all anyone knew, Zinfandel came from outer space.</TE>
<TE>   Recent historical research, largely by wine historian Charles
Sullivan, has revealed that the first "Zinfendal" vine appeared in a
Long Island, N.Y., nursery in the 1820s. It may have come from the
gardens of the Austrian imperial palace in Vienna, which in the 18th
century included vines from every part of the empire, then including
Croatia. Once in the United States, the vine went out West just after
California's statehood in 1850, and it is thought to have shown up in
the Sonoma Valley in 1859.</TE>
<TE>   It arrived in the midst of viticultural mayhem. Because California
has no native wine grapes, hundreds of grape varieties were being
imported and planted during that period of explosive development.
Some were misnamed, others were known by multiple names. Zinfandel
was just a face in the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Yet within a few decades it was the most planted red grape in the
state; only in 2000 was it finally overtaken by Cabernet Sauvignon.
Ultimately, Zinfandel became the symbol of California wine.</TE>
<TE>   Fast-forward to the late 1960s. Goheen, the legendary UC Davis
viticulturist, is traveling in Southern Italy in Puglia, near Bari.
He tastes a spicy, berryish wine that strongly reminds him of
Zinfandel. He asks to be taken to the vineyard--and finds himself
looking at vines that appear to be Zinfandel. His hosts call the
vines Primitivo.</TE>
<TE>   That got the wheels turning. Goheen brought Primitivo cuttings
back to California and confirmed that--visually, at least, since DNA
testing wasn't yet available--they seemed indistinguishable from Zin.
Shortly thereafter, Wolfe, a doctoral candidate in plant genetics,
announced to the American Society of Enology &amp; Viticulture that
isozyme analysis (a precursor of DNA testing) showed that Zinfandel
and Primitivo were probably the same.</TE>
<TE>   The Cutting Edge</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1980s, DNA profiling was developed to a high degree of
accuracy, and Meredith was on its cutting edge. She used it to
demonstrate that the grape known as Pinot Blanc in California was
different from the French Pinot Blanc and was, in fact, the obscure
variety called Melon. Meredith's assistant, graduate student John
Bowers, would later use the same techniques to show that Cabernet
Sauvignon was an offspring of Sauvignon Blanc and Cabernet Franc.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Meredith turned her attention to Zinfandel and Primitivo.
"Here was a mystery, and I thought I could find the answer," she
recalls. "That was the scientific driver." But there was more to it
than just the challenge. "Since we know what part of Europe all our
other varieties came from, we know where to look for new clones that
will give us diversity in California vineyards," says Meredith. "With
Zin, all we could do was look in old California vineyards. But if we
knew where it came from, we could look there and find more diversity
to greatly improve the range of clones."</TE>
<TE>   The DNA tests used on plants are the same as those used on humans.
Tissues (whether blood, muscle or leaf) are subjected to chemicals
that dissolve components progressively until all that's left is a
clear substance containing DNA molecules, each composed of sequences
of nucleotides repeated over and over. A machine scans the isolated
DNA for specific sequences, marks them and makes millions of copies
that are finally visible as bands on gel. Then they can be compared
with DNA from other plants.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, 25 years after Goheen's suspicions were aroused, Meredith
ran a DNA test on tissue samples from Primitivo and Zinfandel vines.
They appeared to be indistinguishable. But the tests were still
rudimentary, so it wasn't until 1995 that a more advanced DNA
analysis convinced Meredith that the two vines were, in fact, the
same variety.</TE>
<TE>   But what did that mean? Primitivo was not a native Italian grape.
Sullivan and other historians believe it may have been introduced
during the 18th century, possibly by Catholic monks. However, no
wines were labeled Primitivo before the 1890s, long after Zin was
established in California. In any case, the true homeland of
Primitivo-Zinfandel was unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Is it the Same?</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1980s, the writer Leon Adams suggested that Zinfandel
might be the same as Plavac Mali, a widely planted Croatian red grape
that yields a berryish, tannic wine similar to Zin. That idea was
pressed in the '90s by Mike Grgich, who had immigrated from Croatia
as a young winemaker in the 1950s and gone on to become a pillar of
the Napa Valley wine community. Grgich (who produces a Plavac Mali
wine in Croatia under the Grgic label) became a prime motivator in
the Zin quest, directing the detectives to promising sites in his
native country.</TE>
<TE>   There were Plavac Mali vines in the UC Davis collection, and some
appeared to be indistinguishable from Zinfandel. However, Meredith's
tests during the late '90s gave mixed results. Knowing that
mislabeling of vines in institutional collections is common, she
decided to go to Croatia and collect samples herself.</TE>
<TE>   No sooner had she started planning a trip than she got an e-mail
from University of Zagreb genetics professor Ivan Pejic asking for
advice on a new project to study the indigenous grapes of Croatia.
"That's when I said, 'I'm coming over there, so why don't we work
together?' " recalls Meredith.</TE>
<TE>   In spring of 1998 she traveled to Croatia and met Pejic and his
colleague, viticulturist Edi Maletic. With Piljac, Meredith's former
lab student, they traveled through the Dalmatian Coast and islands,
taking tissue samples from about 150 Plavac Mali vines in 40
vineyards. Back in her lab at UC Davis, Meredith ran the DNA tests.</TE>
<TE>   The results were disconcerting. Plavac Mali was not Zinfandel.
However, it appeared that one was a parent of the other, although it
wasn't clear which way the genes went. The game was still afoot.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Pejic and Maletic devoted themselves to walking vine
rows in Dalmatia, looking for Zin-like leaf shapes in the spring and
Zin-like fruit in the fall. Finally, in September 2000, they found
another likely suspect in a mixed planting of old varieties. It was a
single specimen of an obscure old variety called Crljenak Kastelanski
(meaning red grape from Kastel, a town near Split). Still lacking the
funds for expensive DNA analysis, they sent tissues from the vine to
Meredith for testing in her UC Davis lab.</TE>
<TE>   No dice. The vines didn't match, and at that point it looked as
though the search had hit a dead-end.</TE>
<TE>   Yet everyone agreed Crljenak really, really looked like Zin. So
Pejic and Maletic went back to the vineyard--a six-hour trek by car
from Zagreb to the coast--where they realized that in the thick
tangle of canes they had mistakenly taken tissue from the shoot tips
of a neighboring vine. This time they made sure their sample was from
the Crljenak vine before they sent it to California.</TE>
<TE>   Bingo. A perfect DNA match linked Crljenak, Zinfandel and
Primitivo. On Dec. 18, 2001, she recalls, Meredith e-mailed Pejic,
saying, "I'm convinced." Subsequent testing of samples from other
vines provided a bonus revelation: Plavac Mali is an offspring of
Crljenak and another Croatian grape, Dobricic.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Crljenak has been rescued from its precarious
position--literally on the brink of extinction--the next step is to
look for more Crljenak vines.</TE>
<TE>   The variety was virtually wiped out by vine diseases in the 19th
century, then further reduced during the Communist era when the
native grapes were systematically replaced by high-yielding varieties
suitable for mass production.</TE>
<TE>   Widening the Pool</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to widen the pool of possible clonal material that can
enrich the grape's diversity. Selections from Croatia will complement
the Zinfandel Heritage Vineyard, a one-acre Napa Valley planting of
Zinfandel selections taken from old vineyards throughout California
by UC Davis clone specialist James Wolpert and his team.</TE>
<TE>   The ongoing search for Crljenak in Croatia, led by Pejic and
Maletic, is being substantially funded by several California wine
producers, led by Ridge Vineyards. The Croatians are focusing on the
large island of Solta, just off the Dalmatian Coast from Split. The
vineyards on Solta include quite a bit of Dobricic, which makes it
likely that Plavac Mali's other parent, Crljenak, may be found there,
too. "It makes sense that if they got together, they must have been
growing fairly close together," notes Meredith. "So Solta is a strong
possibility."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, California producers have begun to propagate both
Primitivo and Plavac Mali and make wine from the grapes (try Tobin
James Cellars Primitivo '99, "James Gang Reserve"). And Crljenak has
been propagated at UC Davis. Cuttings will be available to growers
within a year or so, which means we could begin to see California
Crljenak wines as early as 2006.</TE>
<TE>   And then we'll find out from a sensory standpoint if it's all just
a matter of names. Will, in fact, a Zin by any other name smell as
sweet?</TE>

<HD>Wanted: Camaro Drivers to Cruise Memory Lane</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Chevy Camaro has been part of the American car culture since
bowing as a 1967 model, General Motors Corp.'s answer to the wildly
popular Ford Mustang.</LD>
<LD>   Now GM is killing the Camaro and its Pontiac Firebird cousin,
which arrived as a late-'67 model. There are rumblings about secret
plans to revive the brands with a new look, but that may just be
wishful thinking. (Given what GM did in bringing back the Impala,
resurrections aren't necessarily something to wish for.)</LD>
<LD>   We don't want the passings to go unremarked, so we are inviting
Highway 1 readers to send us their memories.</LD>
<TE>   Short stories of Camaros and Firebirds owned, past and
present--200 words maximum--and color photos or high-resolution
JPEG-format digital images will be gratefully accepted at Los Angeles
Times, Highway 1-Camaro Copy, 202 W. 1st St., Los Angeles, CA 90012;
or highway1@latimes .com (put "Camaro" in the subject field). And
include your name, city and phone number so we can contact you if
there's a need.</TE>
<TE>   Submissions that make us laugh, cry or run out and buy one of the
vanishing vehicles will be printed, either in a special "remembering
the Camaro" issue or from time to time during the remainder of the
year as space permits (obviously we haven't thought it all out yet).
And everything is subject to editing--even our own golden prose often
is polished a bit before seeing print.</TE>
<TE>   P.S.: We keep whatever you submit; no returns. So don't send the
only picture in existence of your beloved '67!</TE>

<DH>Rendezvous and Aztek have same platform, disparate sales</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL and TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Aztek was Pontiac's bid to market a crossover that blended the
best of the minivan and sport utility vehicle and appealed to
younger, active-lifestyle buyers.</LD>
<LD>   The Rendezvous was Buick's bid to market a crossover that blended
the best of the minivan and sport utility vehicle and appealed to
younger buyers, etc.</LD>
<LD>   Both were built off the same General Motors Corp. platform, shared
with the GM minivans.</LD>
<TE>   Pontiac's stylists went for wild, giving the Aztek slab sides,
scoops, side cladding in contrasting colors and a sharply angled
glass hatch in the back.</TE>
<TE>   Buick's stylists went for restrained luxury, giving the Rendezvous
softer, sculpted lines and a smooth rear hatch.</TE>
<TE>   Aztek was roundly cheered by auto reviewers for versatility but
fetched a chorus of hisses and boos for its styling.</TE>
<TE>   Rendezvous got good press on both counts.</TE>
<TE>   Now analysts at J.D. Power &amp; Associates have plowed through sales
data filed by more than 5,000 new-car dealers in 25 major markets and
found that while Rendezvous models typically take about 60 days to
sell, Azteks linger on dealers' lots for an average of 120 days.
(Good news for would-be Aztek buyers: Dealers pay interest on cars on
their lots, so it is cheaper to discount them than to let them hang
around. If you can stomach the looks of an Aztek, you usually can get
a good deal on one.)</TE>
<TE>   The Rendezvous also sells to a young (for Buick) buyer--the
average age is 49--and has helped lower the average age of Buick
buyers overall to 56, versus 64 before Rendezvous was introduced a
year ago.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the average age of an Aztek buyer is 44, and
Pontiac's overall average buyer age of 43 is two years older than it
was before the Aztek was introduced.</TE>
<TE>   Monthly sales data, according to Power, show that Aztek sales have
rarely topped 3,000 units a month since it hit the market two years
ago and this year averaged just 2,300 units a month from January
through June.</TE>
<TE>   But Rendezvous' monthly sales peaked at 6,491 in December, seven
months after the vehicle was introduced, and this year have averaged
5,025 units a month through June.</TE>
<TE>   What a difference design makes.</TE>
<TE>   John O'Dell</TE>
<TE>   GM's Perceived Quality</TE>
<TE>   As General Motors redoubles efforts to improve its reputation in
design and quality, the world's No. 1 auto maker is reaching the
conclusion that the two go hand in glove.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't disconnect one from the other," said Anne Asensio, GM's
executive director of interior design, quality and brand character.</TE>
<TE>   Quality includes customers' perception of workmanship and
attention paid to little things, something at which, Asensio said,
Volkswagen excels.</TE>
<TE>   "For example, the Passat: They use a hard [plastic dashboard]
part, but they create a bevel and it communicates something soft,"
said Asensio, formerly a senior designer with French auto maker
Renault.</TE>
<TE>   Stylists can design in perceived quality with surprising results,
she said during a recent presentation on product quality at GM's
Technical Center.</TE>
<TE>   At GM, for example, policy calls for door and window seals to be
made of premium material, while at VW, at least on the Passat, "they
just stick [on] a piece of tape, but with aluminum and grain
[texture]" that makes the finished product look quite good, Asensio
said.</TE>
<TE>   With material-cost reduction at the forefront of auto makers'
minds these days, designing something that enhances a car's looks but
is less expensive is win-win.</TE>
<TE>   "Designers say, 'That's cool, fresh and communicates something
I've never seen or felt before,' " Asensio said. "But when the
designer is doing cost analysis, you have the whole [project] in
mind."</TE>
<TE>   Providing quality with less-expensive solutions has to be done
just right, however. "If you deliver that in a [Cadillac] Deville,
you're dead," Asensio said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a balance of quality and design. You can have a hot, hot car
that is of lower quality, and it can do well," she said of vehicles
with unique, striking styling.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't provide any examples, but industry analysts point to
cars such as VW's Jetta and the Pontiac Sunfire as less-fancy
vehicles that are popular with younger buyers.</TE>
<TE>   But better quality doesn't need to be reserved for high-end
products. "When you know how to get [good quality], you can go to a
lower segment and it doesn't cost more--you already know how to get
it," Asensio said.</TE>

<TE>   BMW Updates the Z</TE>
<TE>   BMW has released the first photos of its new Z roadster. The new
car isn't just an annual model upgrade but sports a completely new
body that's longer and wider, giving BMW occasion to update the
name--from Z3 to Z4--to call attention to the changes.</TE>
<TE>   The company calls the new BMW Z4 "a modern interpretation of all
the classic roadster features" and says the new design uses an
"interplay of convex and concave surfaces, hard edges and curves" to
create "new transactions of light and shadow from every angle [for]
an eye-catching visual character."</TE>
<TE>   From the front, the Z4 has a little Honda S2000 in it, and from
the rear view there's a dash of Mazda Miata, but overall the new
design retains the shark-like good looks that made the Z3 a standout
on the highway.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the package, according to BMW's first official
description, includes a trunk with 9 cubic feet of space, about what
you'd need for two golf bags or a weekend's luggage for two, if both
are light packers; an automatic soft top (up or down in 10 seconds)
with heated glass rear window and an integrated tonneau cover.</TE>
<TE>   There's a choice of in-line six-cylinder engines: a 2.5-liter
model that pumps out 184 horsepower or a 3.0-liter version that
supplies 225 ponies. The bigger engine comes with either a six-speed
manual or BMW's five-speed automatic with manual mode; the 2.5-liter
comes with five-speed manual or five-speed automatic.</TE>
<TE>   Suspension is a modified version of the 3-Series' underpinnings;
weight distribution is 50% front and 50% rear. Run-flat tires,
traction control and a rollover safety system are standard.</TE>
<TE>   Options will include a navigation system, an integrated hands-free
telephone and a dynamic drive control, which lets the driver dial in
a sport mode that changes system programming for quicker steering,
faster throttle response and a more aggressive shifting pattern for
the automatic.</TE>
<TE>   The for-sale date is sometime this fall in the U.S., next spring
overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Z3, the Z4 will be built in the U.S. at BMW's plant in
Spartanburg, S.C.</TE>

<TE>   GM Design Chief to Stay</TE>
<TE>   General Motors design chief Wayne Cherry will remain at the auto
maker for another year, putting off the handover of one of the most
prominent jobs in automotive design.</TE>
<TE>   Cherry was scheduled to retire in September when he turns 65, but
GM management asked him to stay on to guide GM through the overhaul
of its design operations announced in January.</TE>
<TE>   Under that reorganization, GM scrapped its "brand character"
design studios and set up a system in which five executive directors
of design report to Cherry. They are responsible for: passenger cars;
trucks; design, quality and brand character; engineering operations;
and advanced vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Industry experts believe that GM executives didn't think they
could find an appropriate successor to Cherry either within the
company or from outside by September, and they want more time to
conduct a search for the person who will guide the design of coming
generations of GM vehicles.</TE>

<HD>3 of 4 Small SUVs Are Rated 'Poor' for Crash Repair</HD>
<DH>Insurance* Only Subaru's Forester receives 'good' mark in
low-speed test to determine cost of damage common in parking lot and
traffic jam accidents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Buyers of small sport utility vehicles trade roominess and power for
price, but they don't get much of a price break when it comes to the
cost of repairing low-speed crash damage, the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety found in a recent series of tests.</LD>
<LD>   The insurance industry-funded research group says the tests, which
mimic the kinds of collisions that typically occur in parking lots,
aren't designed to test vehicle safety and reflect only auto makers'
ability to build bumpers that protect against damage that would
require expensive body work.</LD>
<LD>   A vehicle's performance in a low-speed test can foreshadow
insurance premium costs, with those that sustain high levels of
damage and big repair bills typically subject to higher premiums.</LD>
<TE>   The most recent low-speed tests pitted the 2002 models of the
Honda CRV, Land Rover Freelander and Saturn VUE and the redesigned
2003 Subaru Forester against a series of poles and barriers.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the institute released high-speed test results for the
same vehicles Tuesday (see full story in today's Business section).
All but the Freelander received "good" ratings for occupant safety.
The small Land Rover was rated a notch down at "acceptable."</TE>
<TE>   In the low-speed tests, the Subaru received the only "good" rating
in the bunch; the others were rated "poor," with the Honda and Land
Rover at the bottom.</TE>
<TE>   In previous tests, the 1998 version of the Subaru Forester
received a "marginal" rating, while the '98 Honda CRV was rated
"poor." The other two vehicles are new and no previous tests exist.
Damage back then in the series of four crashes totaled $3,534 on the
Honda and $2,337 on the Subaru.</TE>
<TE>   This time around, the redesigned Honda sustained a total of $6,607
in damage, while repair costs for the new Subaru fell to $1,421.</TE>
<TE>   "Subaru is working to improve the bumpers on its vehicles," said
Adrian Lund, the insurance institute's chief operating officer. The
company also is paying attention to repair costs and, after reviewing
the institute tests, agreed to change the way it sells bumper repair
kits to body shops in order to lower repair costs, Lund said.</TE>
<TE>   The company had intended to sell a rear bumper bar and mounting
brackets as a kit for $199, he said. But after the tests revealed
that not all three parts are damaged in a low-speed crash, Subaru
agreed to "unbundle" the parts so shops that needed only to replace
the brackets could buy them separately, at just $18 apiece.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what all manufacturers should do," Lund said. "Improve
bumper designs and reduce the cost of fixing the damage that does
occur."</TE>
<TE>   The institute tests vehicles in the low-speed crashes by
propelling them at 5 mph into a flat barrier, from front and rear,
and from the front into a metal pole and an angled barrier.</TE>
<TE>   In second place behind the Subaru for total damage was Saturn's
VUE, with a repair estimate from the four crashes of $3,389; the Land
Rover Freelander racked up total repair costs of $6,470.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest repair bills for the Land Rover and the Honda were
sustained in the rear crashes. A big reason is that both have spare
tires mounted on the outside of their rear tailgates. The tires
extend out beyond the bumpers, so they get the full impact of any
crash and transmit the force into the tailgate, effectively negating
the rear bumper's usefulness.</TE>
<TE>   The external spare "essentially serves as the bumper," Lund said.
"And it doesn't bump very well."</TE>
<TE>   Car makers whose vehicles do well in such tests often use the
results in advertising campaigns; those whose cars and trucks do
poorly routinely say they design their vehicles for occupant safety,
not merely to minimize crash repair costs.</TE>

<HD>'Wind Wings' a Breath of Fresh Air for Some Drivers</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>

<LD>Question: Why don't auto makers bring back "wind wings"? We all want
the nice air in our faces that side window vents used to provide. My
1967 Oldsmobile Cutlass has wind wings, and they eliminate the need
for air conditioning on most days. It's better than riding in a
convertible.</LD>
<LD>   Raymond L. Liveley</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles</LD>
<TE>   Answer: Mr. Liveley has a point. I also remember growing up with
cars that had those wonderful little hinged windows that allowed you
to feel fresh air without the hurricane-force wind blast you get when
all four windows are open in today's vehicles. Even opening a sunroof
doesn't provide the same refreshing breeze as the old wind wings did.</TE>
<TE>   But don't expect auto manufacturers to bring them back any time
soon. These days the preferred way to cool off in your vehicle is to
turn on the AC.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, almost all new cars and light trucks are
sold with air conditioning, according to the most recent statistics
from the Motor and Equipment Manufacturing Assn. But in 1986, only
69% of the cars on the road had AC, and only a small percentage had
it in 1956, said association spokesman Neal Zipser.</TE>
<TE>   Once AC became popular, auto makers stopped putting in side vents,
Zipser said. By eliminating the side vents, they saved money on parts
and tooling and made cars look sleeker and function better with
improved aerodynamics.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone was as appreciative of side vents as Mr. Liveley,
who's 83. Zipser said "a lot of people thought they caused too much
wind noise in vehicles."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, with all the exhaust, smog and noise pollution today,
it's often a relief to roll up the windows and turn on the AC. Who
wants to be stuck in a freeway traffic jam in 90-degree heat with no
air conditioning? If the hot air doesn't get you, the exhaust fumes
will.</TE>
<TE>   Side vent windows were featured on cars from the late 1930s
through the early 1970s, said Teri Olcott, who writes about classic
and collector vehicles at www.vintagecars.com.</TE>
<TE>   The first "modern" car designed without them was the 1966 Buick
Riviera, she said. As auto makers tried to make vehicles
sleeker-looking and more aerodynamic, they removed them from all new
cars.</TE>
<TE>   Wind wings--and air conditioning--came about with the advent of
enclosed, or hard-top, vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers in the early open-air automobiles enjoyed cool breezes
when the vehicle reached top speeds of 15 mph. When auto makers began
building enclosed cabs, finding ways to cool the car became necessary
during hot summer days.</TE>
<TE>   "Vents were put in the floors of cars, but this brought in more
dirt and dust than it did cool air," Olcott said. The vents later
were moved to the side window area.</TE>
<TE>   A crude form of air conditioning came into existence when most
wheeled transport still was pulled by teams of horses.</TE>
<TE>   In 1884, William Whiteley came up with the idea of "placing blocks
of ice in a holder under horse carriages and blowing air inside by
means of a fan attached to the axle," Olcott said. The same concept
was used to cool early motor vehicles when a bucket of ice was put
near a floor vent.</TE>
<TE>   Hot drivers also tried using an evaporative cooling system that
still is available for vans and recreational vehicles, she said.</TE>
<TE>   And for those luxury car owners who wanted protection from the
wind in the 1920s and '30s, there were optional features that were
like "windshield extensions for open cars." These "deflected the wind
away from the passenger and driver," Olcott said.</TE>
<TE>   The 1940 model Packard was the first car with a "refrigeration
system," or air conditioning. The following year, Cadillac built 300
cars with AC.</TE>
<TE>   Those early air conditioning systems were anything but convenient,
though. Because there was no compressor clutch, the AC pump was on
when the engine was running. The only way to disengage it was to stop
the car, open the hood and remove the belt, Olcott said.</TE>
<TE>   Air conditioning controls weren't available until after World War
II, when Cadillac came out with the feature. Even then, the driver
would have to climb into the back seat to turn off the AC, because
Cadillac engineers installed the controls on the rear package shelf.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until 1957 that "factory air" was offered as a standard
feature. The vehicle was the Cadillac Eldorado Brougham.</TE>
<TE>   We Americans have been much more demanding about having AC in our
vehicles than Europeans, Zipser said. Though European auto makers
have been ahead of the U.S. on offering many safety features, only
about 10% of new vehicles in Europe were equipped with AC in the
early 1990s. Ten years later, it's up to 65%.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Liveley, who belongs to the Southern California Oldsmobile
Club, admits there are times when cranking up the AC in his newer
1995 Olds is the only way to feel comfortable on the streets of Los
Angeles. But he says he'd rather take a spin around town in the '65
with the wind wings open.</TE>

<HD>Anchor Laura Diaz, at KABC for 19 Years, Joins Rival KCBS</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laura Diaz, KABC-TV's lead female anchor on "Eyewitness News" and a
mainstay at the station for nearly two decades, will join rival
KCBS-TV in September in what is being called a key component of the
merger between KCBS and KCAL-TV.</LD>
<LD>   "Laura is absolutely the No. 1 female anchor in Los Angeles, and
we have lured her to become the cornerstone in building the biggest
duopoly in the nation," said Don Corsini, general manager of the two
stations. "Laura knows the marketplace, and she has done an
outstanding job at KABC for the last 19 years."</LD>
<LD>   In addition to becoming the main anchor at KCBS, Diaz said she
will make several appearances as a West Coast correspondent for CBS'
prime-time newsmagazine "48 Hours" and will also be a news reader for
the network's morning news. Diaz may also appear at times on sister
station KCAL.</LD>
<TE>   "It's interesting how life turns out," Diaz said Tuesday. "This is
the chance of a lifetime. I will be a part of a dynamic news
operation that will have the opportunity to cover more news and has
an incredible stable of talent. I'm just thrilled at the
opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Still to be determined are what newscasts Diaz will anchor, but
Corsini said she will helm two shows a day. No further anchor changes
are planned at this time, he said, though there is speculation her
hiring will reduce the role of Gretchen Carr or Ann Martin.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz said her last "Eyewitness News" appearance was on Friday,
with management keeping her off the air Monday even though she was
prepared to work. "I would have liked to say goodbye," she said. "I
have nothing but respect for all the people at KABC. It was a
wonderful place to work. They made me a nice offer, but Viacom-CBS
offered me the opportunity of a lifetime." KABC officials couldn't be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Hiring Diaz is the most dramatic development yet in the merger of
KCAL and KCBS, two stations owned by Viacom. Federal regulations
prohibiting ownership of two TV stations in the same market were
relaxed in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Questions linger as to whether Diaz can boost ratings at KCBS,
which has traditionally trailed its rivals and experienced continuous
management changes. Corsini pointed out that Diaz is a
first-generation Mexican American who is extremely active in the
Latino community and will be "a big plus" for the station.</TE>
<TE>   Layoffs are anticipated as the stations consolidate, though it's
not clear how deep they will go. Corsini said that the merging of the
news operations is continuing: "We are building the best of the best
teams. We've started by hiring the best and brightest of anchors. The
power of the duopoly is that we will have bigger and better news
coverage."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the merger, KCAL is moving several departments into
KCBS' Columbia Square location in Hollywood. The news staff is
expected to relocate in September.</TE>

<HD>Blond Ambition</HD>
<DH>It worked for Ozzy. A put-upon performer allows cameras to
follow her for 'reality' TV's latest twist, 'The Anna Nicole Show.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>E! Entertainment Television--home to programming about dead-celebrity
gossip and recycled scandals--has bagged a live one.</LD>
<LD>   She is Anna Nicole Smith, the former Guess? Jeans and Playboy
pinup who more recently was seen on TV as a grieving widow testifying
for her piece of a Texas oil tycoon's fortune.</LD>
<LD>   Smith, hoping to reinstate her good image and also get out of the
house, will now star in "The Anna Nicole Show" for E!, which is
hoping that the plus-sized actress?/model?/guinea pig? will do for
ratings and press attention what Ozzy Osbourne and clan did in recent
months for MTV.</LD>
<TE>   Osbourne, for all his addled rock-star drooling, seems to have a
good deal more show-biz savvy than Smith, who met the media on
Tuesday in Pasadena at a semiannual gathering of television critics
and reporters from around the country.</TE>
<TE>   Seated onstage with her "cast"--lawyer Howard Stern, purple-haired
personal assistant Kim, makeup artist Angie and her poodle, Sugar
Pie--Smith was asked what she hoped to get out of the show.</TE>
<TE>   "People will see that maybe I have a little talent and will take
me serious as an actress," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Someone else asked Smith who she thought her fans were. "Large
women and college boys," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith was wearing a Goth fan's amount of eye makeup and had
squeezed herself into a tight black dress. She talked in her sleepy
Texas drawl. Smith evidently likes the color pink, which was the
motif in the small ballroom, where reporters were given pink "Anna
Nicole Show" notepads and Godiva chocolates. The chocolates were not
pink, however.</TE>
<TE>   Sugar Pie was resting on Smith's lap, recalling FDR's beloved dog
Fala. There was a large banner featuring the tagline for her
show--"It's not supposed to be funny, it just is." Asked whether she
thought E! was making fun of her by giving her a show, Smith said:
"They probably are, but just like it says ... "</TE>
<TE>   She never finished the thought, leaving reporters to speculate.
But in an interview in her hotel room before the news conference,
Smith said she feels she's misunderstood--as a gold digger, as a dumb
blond. "People assume, assume, assume," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith evidently needs money, and E! definitely needs a reason to
be written about, so their relationship, you see, is symbiotic. Smith
is still waiting to collect on her inheritance from her marriage to
the late Texas oilman J. Howard Marshall II, who died in 1995 at age
90, but the money could be tied up for years in appeals. The couple
had been married only 14 months before Smith was widowed. A Texas
probate court awarded her $450 million of Marshall's fortune, but the
oil tycoon's stepson, E. Pierce Marshall, appealed.</TE>
<TE>   In March, a U.S. District judge in California trimmed the award to
$88 million. Marshall has once again appealed, and the case is now
set for the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals--the same court that
recently ruled the "under God" part of the Pledge of Allegiance was
in violation of the separation of church and state.</TE>
<TE>   She's been sober since 1995, Smith said, although she's still a
social drinker. Asked what she'd been doing lately, Smith said: "I
was in my bed for six months, all depressed."</TE>
<TE>   To help her cope, she had gone to a therapist but not regularly.
No, she had not consulted the therapist about whether doing a show on
E! was the best way to emerge from depression.</TE>
<TE>   As she talked, two cameras rolled--E! crews capturing every waking
moment of her life. According to E! President Mindy Herman, the Anna
Nicole "E! True Hollywood Story" always prompted a spike in the
show's ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "My lawyer pretty much had me locked up," Smith said, referring to
Stern, her lawyer/co-star, who is not the Howard Stern on the radio.
Her 16-year-old son, Daniel, who will also be in the show, didn't
think she should do this, but "he's just doin' it for mama cause he
loves me," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Anna Nicole Show" debuts Aug. 4. Currently in production, the
show has an order for 13 episodes. Crews are shooting Smith and
company at her house, a leased $1.3-million home in Studio City. The
home has five bedrooms and 5 1/2 bathrooms in 4,700 square feet, with
city views.</TE>
<TE>   The house is not the only location for the show, however, For
instance, in one episode, Smith goes bowling.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what she will demand if "The Anna Nicole Show" becomes a hit
by E!'s standards and she can renegotiate her contract, Smith said:
"More money."</TE>

<HD>Beyond Appearances in Suburbia</HD>
<DH>Work that deconstructs the white picket fence image of
pureness and order is gathered for a disorienting gallery exhibition
in Manhattan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIELLA BUDICK</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Suburbia, in its ideal form, is a place free from ambiguity. Neat,
evenly spaced houses surrounded by kempt green lawns and tidy gardens
have stood, in movies, on television and in the popular American
consciousness, as symbols of normality and as concrete manifestations
of the American Dream.</LD>
<LD>   Recently, though, the suburbs have come in for a drubbing. Films
such as "American Beauty" and the HBO series "The Sopranos" wallow in
the undercurrents of dysfunction beneath the placid reverie. That
dyspeptic, surreal and yet vaguely affectionate take on the suburbs
is one that photographers, sculptors and painters have been spinning
for decades, as a rather hallucinatory new show at the Barbara
Gladstone Gallery in Manhattan intoxicatingly demonstrates.</LD>
<LD>   The exhibition, "American Standard: (Para)Normality and Everyday
Life," has been put together by New York City-based photographer
Gregory Crewdson, whose own work imagines uncanny, sometimes sinister
suburban rituals. (Twenty of his photos are on display in "Twilight,"
at Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills.)</LD>
<TE>   Like many young photographers today, Crewdson does not document
events: He creates them according to his own specifications, using
the cinematographer's tools. Crewdson supervises the construction of
elaborate sets and directs his actors in their performance of rites
he invents. His pictures, bulging with all the visual details he can
pack into them, tell ambiguous tales of violence and alienation in
meticulously ordered surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   It's not surprising that, when acting as curator, Crewdson should
turn to his own antecedents. Edward Hopper, Diane Arbus, Bill Owens,
Cindy Sherman, Joel Sternfeld, Eric Fischl and the other artists he
invokes all reveal the darkness lying beneath normality's sunny
trappings. Beyond that, they are all masters of disorientation, using
a range of carefully contrived formal devices--such as cinematic
lighting, supersaturated color and vertiginous dislocations in
scale--to skew the ordinary into something artificial and blatantly
surreal.</TE>
<TE>   In Fischl's "Best Western" (1983), a clean-cut blond boy in jeans
and sneakers kneels by a large backyard pool in some warm suburb.
It's nighttime, the sky lowers against the dark trees and the kid is
practicing warfare with oranges. He gathers the pieces of fruit in
his arms like a Caravaggio Bacchus, then bowls them at toy soldiers
he has carefully positioned on the cement.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing inherently bizarre or disturbing in the scenario.
We know that children of all ages routinely engage in aggressive
play. But the way the boy's skeletal blond head glows against the
black foliage, the smoky, lurid color of the sky and the abject
solitude of the game together imbue the painting with an ominous
drama.</TE>
<TE>   In the same room, Crewdson has ingeniously juxtaposed John
Currin's portrait of an adolescent "Mary O'Connel" (1989) with Keith
Edmier's life-size "Jill Peters," a sculpture of a pale, fair-haired
woman dressed in an ensemble of man-made fabrics, all the same
pristine, virginal white. The two look like different versions of the
same nymphet.</TE>
<TE>   Currin paints her as she might appear in a high school yearbook
picture, fair hair falling off her face in two perfectly feathered
wings. But this girl is moodier than she should be. Her mouth is
sullen, her skin anemic, her eyes hard.</TE>
<TE>   In Edmier's vision of suburban girlhood, the blond hair is equally
pale and soft. But instead of a sulk, Jill wears a smile as rigid as
the vinyl she's molded out of. Everything about her looks
manufactured, from the expression on her face to the white rayon and
polyester clothes she wears. She's an ode to artificiality.</TE>
<TE>   That sense that America is built upon a scaffolding of illusions
is the subtext of the show. It's impossible to miss in Owens' "I
bought the lawn in six foot rolls" (1973), a photograph of a family
fitting patches of turf together like jigsaw puzzle pieces, hiding
the sandy wasteland beneath. Or in Sternfeld's spectacular color
photo "After a Flash Flood, Rancho Mirage, California, July 1979,"
which reveals the flimsiness of our nation's foundations. Sternfeld
gives us a cross section of a subdivision laid low by catastrophe.
Pseudo-adobe ranch houses rest on the thinnest veneer of concrete,
and below that are several hundred feet of mottled beige sand.</TE>
<TE>   Arbus also explored the way America rests upon such shallowness.
In "A Castle in Disneyland, California" (1962), Arbus endows this
gossamer icon of the Magic Kingdom with all the solid weight of an
ancestral home. Disney is the closest thing we have to a national
patrimony, she suggests. Never mind if it's all a fantasy land.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder why Crewdson didn't also include Arbus' "House on a Hill,
Hollywood, CA" (1963), which is not a house at all, but a rickety
stage set that looks like a cross between the Bates Motel in the
Alfred Hitchcock thriller "Psycho" and the out-of-reach farmhouse in
the corner of Andrew Wyeth's popular masterpiece "Christina's World."
More than anyone else, Arbus was able to pinpoint that site at the
intersection of the banal and the grotesque that also lies at the
heart of Crewdson's aesthetic.</TE>
<TE>   But apart from his own sensibility, Crewdson claims in the catalog
that a broader tradition unites the works he has chosen for this
show, one that, in his words, "explores the intersection of everyday
life and theatricality."</TE>
<TE>   But what finally unites the objects and images in this
extraordinary show is the story that they collectively tell about
life in the suburbs. It's a narrative of beauty and alienation,
weirdness and wonder. The American Dream, they suggest, is not quite
a nightmare, but a long, strange trip.</TE>

<LD>   Don't play the race card. You guys are on the verge of something
big with this music- industry reform thing. You have the chance to
become major players on this issue, especially if you continue the
partnership with the Recording Artists Coalition and the growing
number of musician-friendly legislators looking to overturn the
ailing industry.</LD>
<LD>   But you'll mess it up if you claim racism is the industry's main
problem. We all know the industry's main problem is greed--where the
only color that matters is green.</LD>
<TE>   Sure, you can trot out great performers like James Brown and
Little Richard who, despite having huge hits, struggle financially
due to their record contracts. However, even more white artists
suffer for the same reason.</TE>
<TE>   When you first announced your plans for the "Music Industry
Initiative," race wasn't in the equation. At the news conference
announcing the summit, which began Tuesday, Rev. Al, you said, "It is
our intention to break up the kinds of indentured servant type of
arrangement that many in the record industry now have. We hope that
this initiative would make it possible where one day the artist on
the CD is as big as the companies that put out the CD."</TE>
<TE>   That's the kind of talk that puts extra quake in a music industry
already shaking from falling profits, rising piracy, threatening
technological advances and an increasingly competitive marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   The only way the industry will change is if it has no other
choice. Limiting options is already leading to possibly ending the
payola-like system of payments to radio stations and possibly
overturning the exemption that allows the industry to hold musicians
in long-term contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Recording Artists Coalition has lots of old-guard
industry clout, it lacks the red-hot membership you have. Will the
record industry freak out over Don Henley starting his own label?
Probably not. Will it worry about competing against a label fronted
by Jay-Z and the Roc-a-Fella family? You bet.</TE>
<TE>   Race has nothing to do with that either. Like Will Smith says in
"Men in Black II," it has to do with "old and busted" and "the new
hotness."</TE>
<TE>   Same goes for Michael Jackson. "If you fight for me, you're
fighting for all black people, dead and alive," Jackson told you
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   How'd you keep a straight face? We know his $30-million-to-make,
$25-million-to-promote album "Invincible" didn't fail because a
racist-driven Sony didn't support it. It failed because it wasn't
very good.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's idea of pressuring Sony Music CEO Tommy Mottola with
this "I heard him use the N-word" tactic is equally half-baked--not
only is Mottola known for fostering good relations with black
artists, but, more important, the super-shrewd leader would never be
that stupid. Such posturing smacks of desperation, the kind that
comes from drowning in debt and looking for a way to save your
career.</TE>
<TE>   He's sad, sure, but you have bigger worries.</TE>
<TE>   Forget about race till it's actually required.</TE>

<HD>Britain's FilmFour Closing</HD>
<DH>Movies* In a blow to filmmaking in the U.K., the respected
company behind 'Crying Game' and 'Trainspotting' succumbs to money
problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GRITTEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>A long, rich era of British filmmaking abruptly came to a close
Tuesday when Channel 4 television closed down its movie production
arm, FilmFour.</LD>
<LD>   As part of a restructuring following heavy financial losses,
FilmFour will cease to operate as a distributor and an international
sales company, while its production function will be re-integrated
into Channel 4 at a sharply reduced level. Most of its 59 employees
are expected to be let go.</LD>
<LD>   A wave of sadness swept the British film industry at the news of
FilmFour's demise, even at rival production companies. For much of
the last two decades, Channel 4 simply was the British film industry,
often soldiering on alone and investing in local filmmakers' projects
when no one else was willing. Under former chief executive Michael
Jackson, who left last year to run what is now Universal Television
in the U.S., the parent network launched FilmFour as a stand-alone
subsidiary in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   It will be remembered as a company with a knack for making small,
cutting-edge, distinctively British films, some of which went on to
achieve huge international success.</TE>
<TE>   These included "My Beautiful Laundrette" (1985), which was
originally made just for television. It gave Daniel Day-Lewis his
first starring role, broke new ground in portraying an interracial
gay romance and secured an Oscar nomination for screenwriter Hanif
Kureishi. "The Crying Game" (1992), a thriller-love story with an
astonishing plot twist, bombed in Britain, but was so energetically
marketed by Miramax in the U.S. that it became a box-office hit, and
director Neil Jordan won a screenwriting Oscar. In 1996 came
"Trainspotting," a visceral roller coaster of a movie about young
drug addicts in Edinburgh, Scotland. Its production cost was $3.5
million, but it grossed more than 20 times that at the international
box office, a ratio almost unheard of in film financing circles.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Channel 4 invested heavily in the films of such
social-realist directors as Mike Leigh and Ken Loach, and scored
internationally in the following decade with hits like "Four Weddings
and a Funeral" and "The Madness of King George" (both 1994). More
modest successes included "East Is East" (1999) and "Croupier"
(2000). But FilmFour lost its way in the last year or two, and "East
Is East" was its last genuine hit.</TE>
<TE>   Respected by Competitors</TE>
<TE>   "Any reduction of funding for British films is a sad thing," said
Tim Bevan, co-chairman of Working Title, Britain's most successful
production company (a subsidiary of Vivendi Universal). "I feel bad
for Channel 4. They've been judged on their first five years, and I
wonder if Working Title would have lasted had we been judged on our
first five years. They gave us our first hit with 'My Beautiful
Laundrette,' and that was their first hit too." (The two companies
co-produced the film.)</TE>
<TE>   The closure of FilmFour comes at a particularly tough time for the
British film industry. The company was plowing some 31 million pounds
($46 million) annually into film production, but under the new
restructuring, Channel 4 will invest only a third of this amount,
mostly into low-budget films. Production in Britain is currently
stagnant, and potential investors are extremely cautious. It is hard
to raise money to make films.</TE>
<TE>   So what went wrong? In part, FilmFour was the victim of attempts
to transform it into a global player. Paul Webster, who joined the
division as chief executive in 1999, revised the formula of spreading
its budget thinly over several low-budget films, and opted for a
"portfolio" approach, including more expensive, international films
into the mix.</TE>
<TE>   To this end, FilmFour entered into a co-production deal with
Warner Bros., but the first two films under this arrangement were
hugely disappointing. The hotly anticipated "Charlotte Gray" (2001),
starring Cate Blanchett, failed to find favor with critics or
audiences, while the Robin Williams-Danny DeVito comedy vehicle
"Death to Smoochy" bombed in the U.S. earlier this year, and its
prospects in other territories look gloomy.</TE>
<TE>   But even on its traditional turf--lower-budget movies--FilmFour
seemed to be losing its touch. Last summer, it released the jailhouse
comedy "Lucky Break" with a substantial marketing budget. But the
British public stayed away in droves.</TE>
<TE>   And this year, FilmFour has exhibited classic symptoms of a
company lacking morale and a loss of nerve. It abruptly pulled the
Andie MacDowell comedy "Crush" from the schedule three weeks before
its British opening, rationalizing that it would be better for the
film to open in the U.S. first. This move marked the film as damaged
goods in Britain; it bombed in both territories.</TE>
<TE>   Only two weeks ago, FilmFour's "Birthday Girl," starring Nicole
Kidman, opened to ho-hum business in the U.K., where Kidman has
enjoyed extraordinary success with her last two films, "Moulin Rouge"
and "The Others." The publicity campaign for "Birthday Girl" seemed
halfhearted--as if FilmFour itself no longer believed in the movie.</TE>
<TE>   This constituted a terrible run, financially and creatively, and
it was played out against a background of rising losses. Last year
FilmFour reported an operating loss of 5.4 million pounds ($8.1
million) on revenue of 43.1 million pounds ($64.6 million) against a
loss of 3 million pounds ($4.5 million) in 2000. Clearly, the writing
was on the wall. Now Webster has made it clear he will not be
considered to head the new, small film unit, which significantly will
be housed in Channel 4's main building in central London, and not at
FilmFour's separate premises.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem for FilmFour was that it became cast adrift
culturally. Channel 4's film division always flourished when its aims
and ambitions reflected that of its parent company. Channel 4
launched itself as Britain's fourth terrestrial TV channel in 1982,
with a mandate to serve minority audiences and include voices and
viewpoints seldom heard on, say, the BBC. Its earlier films--"My
Beautiful Laundrette," as well as Leigh's and Loach's work--were
left-of-center and anti-Thatcherite, thus complementing those aims.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, Channel 4 became more youthful, hip and irreverent,
and so were many of its films: the influential "Trainspotting" and
its predecessor, "Shallow Grave" (1994), made a star of actor Ewan
McGregor and their creative team: producer Andrew MacDonald, director
Danny Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in recent years Channel 4 has sought to establish itself as a
mainstream, commercial (if youthful) entertainment channel; in
Britain, it is now known primarily as the channel that broadcasts
"Friends" and "Big Brother." FilmFour has tried to follow its lead;
at one point Webster wanted it to concentrate on low-budget comedies,
but first-rate comedy writers are scarce in Britain. "It was a lot
easier for FilmFour when Channel 4 had a strong, decisive [mandate],"
said Working Title's Bevan.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone thinks FilmFour's closure was inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax's Harvey Weinstein, who has distributed several of the
company's films in the U.S., thinks pulling the plug is "a huge
mistake."</TE>
<TE>   "FilmFour is the best thing that ever happened to the British film
industry," he said. "It has built up a great library of movies. Films
I made 10 years ago that didn't make much money are now making good
profits because of video and DVD sales. Movie companies are built on
the strength of their libraries. Stay the course and you will win."</TE>
<TE>   But a telling comment on the company's demise came Tuesday from
its managing director, Rob Woodward. "Over the last four years," he
said, "significant investment and hard work has gone into FilmFour to
develop it as a meaningful player internationally. However this has
not proved possible, given the sheer scale of the major studios."
FilmFour shifted its ground, tried to take on Hollywood--and paid the
price.</TE>

<HD>She's Still Tooting Her Father's Horn</HD>
<DH>Entertainment* Louis Prima's daughter, Lena, carries
nostalgic audiences back to a simpler age.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RON GROSSMAN</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>On a warm summer evening, Lena Prima sat on one of the lower rungs of
show biz and reminisced about her father, who dwelt at the very top
of the ladder. "When you're the child of a celebrity, you think other
kids' lives are like yours," Prima said. "You take it for granted
that, at a posh place like Scoma's in San Francisco or Dante's down
in Florida, headwaiters whisk you around a line of people waiting for
tables."</LD>
<LD>   Her dressing room on this evening was a construction trailer
parked behind a temporary stage set up in the middle of South Oakley
Avenue, the main artery of a tiny Italian American enclave on
Chicago's Southwest Side. She was stitching a seam in her costume
that split the last time she performed her act--a reprise of the life
and times of her father, Louis Prima. In the 1940s and '50s, the
exuberant trumpet player with the raspy, street-corner singing voice
was a top recording star and perennial headliner in Las Vegas and on
television.</LD>
<TE>   For this street fair on Oakley Avenue, folding chairs had been set
up, curb to curb. The rows stretched back past Miceli's Deli and Food
Mart and underneath a storefront marquee announcing the offices of
Maurice D. Russo, DDS. The last vacant seat was taken long before
Lena Prima was scheduled to go on. The audience, mainly older folks
who live or used to live nearby, gave polite attention to a
miscellany of other acts. But clearly most people were patiently
waiting for Lena. More precisely, they were waiting for her to
temporarily transform herself into him--and transport them, their old
neighborhood and America back to a simpler age.</TE>
<TE>   Lena Prima belongs to a special cadre of performers who are the
children of performers. A few, such as Liza Minnelli or Michael
Douglas, escape their parents' shadow to become headliners in their
own right. Others--such as Frank Sinatra Jr. or Mercer Ellington, who
kept his late father Duke Ellington's jazz band alive--carry onstage
the burden of their parents' accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   Lena considers that load an equitable deal between herself and her
father, who died in 1978. She gets work. His songs get played again.
Now 38, she has been performing since her father took her onstage at
the age of 5. She went on to sing with the rock group Spiral
Staircase, but her share of show business was shrinking before she
got the idea to make his act hers, about four years ago. "Dad went
directly from the Tropicana Hotel, where he was appearing, to a
hospital with the brain tumor that killed him," Lena said. "This is a
way for him to come back."</TE>
<TE>   Posthumous Renaissance</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Louis Prima has been enjoying something of a posthumous
renaissance. His song "Jump, Jive and Wail" was featured in a Gap
television commercial exploiting a younger generation's new-found
interest in swing dancing. He was an offstage presence in the 1996
movie "Big Night," the story of a failing restaurant whose owners
hope to be saved by his celebrity rubbing off on them: They've heard,
falsely as it turns out, that Prima is coming to dine. Judging by the
reaction of the Oakley Avenue audience, he still enjoys that demi-god
status in certain precincts.</TE>
<TE>   During Lena's re-creation of his act, one older woman stood
transfixed directly in front of the stage. At the end of a number,
she would bring her hands to her lips, palms joined, as if saying a
novena. Her reaction wasn't atypical, noted Ron Onesti, the
Chicago-based promoter who books Lena's appearances.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had people break down crying," Onesti said. "Their vision
is black and white, from before color TV. Watch how they'll line up
to tell her where they saw her father." As if on cue, Ray Biamonte
trailed Lena back to the dressing room after her standing ovation at
the end of the show.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a picture of your father and me, must be from the '50s,
maybe at the Chicago Theater," he told her. "I don't know where I put
it." In the 1950s, Prima was a serious jazzman turned consummate
entertainer. Earlier, he had written "Sing, Sing, Sing!," which Benny
Goodman's recording made into a swing anthem. But Prima was looking
for a wider audience. He found it by musically treading a fine line
between celebrating and satirizing his Italian American heritage with
songs like "Please No Squeeza Da Banana" and "Josephina, Please No
Leana on the Bell." He also found a perfect counterpoint in Keely
Smith, his singing partner and wife, whose bell-clear phrasing and
deadpan expression set off his gravelly voice and madcap antics. She
was also the foil for sexual-innuendo byplay. Mild by today's
standards, it took the form of a bug-eyed Prima looking her up and
down, then turning to the audience with a look on his face that said:
"Hey, guys--see what I got going for me!"</TE>
<TE>   Prima also didn't so much play a song as act out the notes, Onesti
observed. When the melody rose, so did he, pointing his trumpet
skyward and leaping in the air. He'd follow a falling melodic line
right down to the stage floor. And he'd finish some numbers with an
ever-increasing tempo, wildly spinning around like a whirling
dervish. "Energy, he was all energy," Onesti said, "something today's
singers don't have."</TE>
<TE>   Lena's audience so hungered for its return, they were willing to
help supply it themselves. At the chorus of some of her father's
songs, Lena would stop singing and say, "Hey, you know this tune."
People on the folding chairs would then take up the lyrics, while she
conducted them, using a hand-held microphone as her baton as there
echoed down Oakely Avenue lyrics like: "Buona sera, signorina, buona
sera/It is time to say goodnight to Napoli." Her act also included
home movies: kinescopes of her father's appearances on "The Ed
Sullivan Show" and a tour of the Prima family photo album, beginning
with her baby pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Bright Lights, Family Life</TE>
<TE>   She explained to the crowd that her mother was Gia Maione, who won
a talent-show competition to find a new partner for Prima when Keely
Smith left the act in 1961. "Thank goodness, he kept on marrying,"
Lena said, "or I wouldn't be here. Mom was his fifth wife."</TE>
<TE>   Lena remembers her childhood as a mixture of bright lights and
Ozzie-and-Harriet family life. Prima made his home in Las Vegas. He
would tour 40 weeks a year--all of it by motor coach, since he had an
incurable fear of flying. When school was out for the summer, she
would join her father in rolling down the nation's highways like any
other family on vacation--until they arrived at his next booking and
headwaiters would greet her like a princess. Her father loved people
and, even as the waiters were stowing chairs on nightclub tables
after hours, he would go on signing autographs until the very last of
his fans left the room. Her present life still perpetuates those
cycles of the glamorous and the pedestrian. Her bookings have picked
up this year, she reports. Besides Oakley Avenue, she recently played
the Potawatomie gambling casino in Milwaukee and the 510 Club in
Providence, R.I. She also made a 10-city tour of Florida. Between
gigs, she still lives in Las Vegas, her life there little different
from that of other folks. Yet while other families watch "It's a
Wonderful Life" while preparing Christmas dinner, Lena always puts on
a tape of "Big Night." It's her favorite film, though she thinks the
scriptwriters got it wrong, at least in one respect.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was really my father," she said, "he'd have shown up."</TE>

<HD>Donahue's Back, With No Plans to Be Neutral</HD>
<DH>Television* The host, whose new show hits MSNBC Monday,
says his concerns include liberals moving center and dissent being
squelched.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SECAUCUS, N.J.</DL>
<LD>His voice rising to a near-shout, his hands in the air over his head,
Phil Donahue seems ready to burst out of the tiny, standard-issue
interior office adjacent to one of the no-frills MSNBC cubicle
warrens here.</LD>
<LD>   He's on a tear, passionately railing against the possibility of
the U.S. killing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and, more broadly,
what he says are attacks in this country on the U.S. way of life as
safeguarded by the Bill of Rights: attempts to "squelch dissent," the
invasions of privacy, the limits on "the right to meet our accusers."
And there's no TV camera in sight.</LD>
<LD>   The office, which he uses as his base when working from MSNBC,
contains no visible stacks of files, but there's a hairbrush,
canisters of pretzels and peanuts and a box of crackers. It leaves
the impression that the preparation for his new MSNBC show--which
makes its debut Monday (airing at 5 and 8 p.m. Pacific time), a
centerpiece in the cable channel's latest attempt to remake itself,
this time in a more opinionated mode--is all in his head, in the
litany of issues he is itching to debate.</LD>
<TE>   Donahue, 66, was a pioneer in daytime talk before ratings pressure
drove the format into an increasingly tawdry phase. With his ratings
declining precipitously, he quit in 1996. The terrorist attacks of
Sept. 11 made him want to come back, he said, particularly because he
perceived pressure to limit dissenting opinions on such issues as the
bombing of Afghanistan. But after his time working on Ralph Nader's
losing Green Party presidential campaign, "I had no idea how
employable I was or not. Nader's not exactly a launching pad for
television personalities."</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC, trying to create some buzz and get out of third place among
cable news channels, answered that question. Though Fox News Channel,
CNN and MSNBC all have programs facing off conservative and liberal
commentators, Donahue will be one of the few left-of-center voices
with his own daily platform, in a television talk landscape
increasingly dominated by conservatives. "We think the audience will
be receptive to views not seen that often today," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although many conservatives have been quick to decry a liberal
bias in network news and the media in general, there are almost no
true liberals hosting TV talk shows, said Alex Jones, director of
Harvard University's Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics
and Public Policy, and he's waiting to see what Donahue has to say
before putting him in that camp.</TE>
<TE>   "Conservatives have been very successful at defining 'liberal' as
anything that is not conservative; they have redefined the center,"
said Jones, defining a true liberal as someone like Massachusetts
Institute of Technology professor Noam Chomsky, who considers the New
York Times "a really reactionary tool of the government.... I don't
think Donahue is anything like Chomsky."</TE>
<TE>   Donahue is quick to agree that the left has moved toward the
center. "[Former President] Bill Clinton is 12 noon!" he exclaimed,
adding that he himself is "left of Bill Clinton." He rattles off his
stance on various issues to prove it, expressing support for
single-payer health plans, public financing of campaigns, enhancing
the opportunity to form unions. "I don't think one company should own
1,200 radio stations," he said, in a reference to Clear Channel
Communications, "[and] I don't think we should execute retarded
people." He then veers off into a commentary on a recent Supreme
Court ruling, proclaiming that the Nader camp is "too well raised to
say, 'I told you so,' " barreling on to explain why the drug war
isn't working.</TE>
<TE>   "Not in my lifetime," he said, "have there been this many critical
issues."</TE>
<TE>   Donahue said he "knows what it's like to be called an
anti-American" and be labeled a liberal and that there's been "no
attempt to encourage me to pretend I'm someone else." For all his
strong opinions, he said, the show will be fair, allowing guests with
opposing viewpoints to have their say without featuring guests
screaming at each other, as elsewhere on cable.</TE>
<TE>   The show is being described as a cross between CNN's Larry King
and Donahue's direct competitor in the time period, Fox's Bill
O'Reilly. "Stylistically, the format will look more like Larry King,"
said MSNBC President Erik Sorenson, but "the show will have more edge
than Larry does.... He's not going to be neutral."</TE>
<TE>   Donahue's show is part of a broader overhaul of MSNBC that begins
Monday, including two hours of midday debate from former California
Democratic leader Bill Press and conservative Pat Buchanan and a new
show hosted by Jerry Nachman, a former New York Post editor and
longtime TV news executive. On the same night, "The News With Brian
Williams" will start airing exclusively on CNBC.</TE>
<TE>   Despite what seems to be his penchant for impassioned tirades,
Donahue said, "I don't think you can preach. It's OK to make a point,
but you can't take all day doing it." He'll also participate in the
celebrity booking wars, competing for sought-after guests with CNN's
King and Connie Chung, who airs opposite him.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a celebrity culture," he said. "It's no good talking if
people aren't listening."</TE>

<LD>"Tonight's junk, sure to poison the minds of your children, has been
brought to you by ... click."</LD>
<LD>   Advertisers still rely on television to deliver their messages,
but with viewers less apt to idly endure commercial breaks, sponsors
feel increasingly compelled to think outside the box and get inside
the programs--trying to trump technology by integrating their spiels
into the shows themselves.</LD>
<LD>   However insidious this trend may be, as long as advertisers fret
about being zapped into oblivion, it is going to continue. The only
question is how much further the scales can tip before someone
decides to toss a brick on them.</LD>
<TE>   As it is, sponsors have already squeezed into every lapse during
sports ("And now the Maalox 'Heartburn' Moment"); fully sponsored
series such as the WB's "No Boundaries," which took its title from
Ford; incorporated clunky product tie-ins into shows such as CBS'
"Survivor" and Fox's "American Idol"; and even found their way into
plots, with ABC's "All My Children" working Revlon into its narrative
as a rival to Erica Kane's fictional cosmetics line.</TE>
<TE>   Networks say they are open to sponsor-supplied programs and
elaborate product-placement schemes as long as the buyers don't
dictate content, but who are they kidding? Why would companies pony
up cash without expecting some input over how it's spent?</TE>
<TE>   Although some sponsors push the limit with ads that are racier
than the adjacent programs, many do covet a "safe environment" (that
is, shows that won't offend a single customer) for their spots--as
evidenced by the Family Friendly Programming Forum, an advertiser
consortium that not only underwrites script development but also has
its own annual awards show that airs next month on ABC.</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, zapping is a legitimate problem for media buyers, and
new toys have only made matters worse. They fear people like me, who
start watching "The West Wing" 15 minutes into the show so we can use
our TiVo recorders to zip through the interminable commercial pods
and be done in time for "Law &amp; Order."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some of the solutions sound as if advertisers are trying to
return TV to the 1950s, when they controlled programs and didn't have
to worry about Ozzie getting too frisky with Harriet, much less
screaming obscenities at the kids.</TE>
<TE>   "Advertisers have only one aim, which is to sell their product,
and therefore the programming must conform to what will sell their
product or be changed if they have control," said Marshall
Herskovitz, who with partner Ed Zwick has produced "thirtysomething"
and "Once and Again."</TE>
<TE>   While acknowledging the economic pressures that networks face,
Herskovitz noted that Hollywood's creative voices need to consider
what sort of resistance can be mounted if the practice goes much
further. "I don't want to depend on the goodwill or sophistication of
the ad agencies to tell me what's permissible," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Those remarks echo Sylvester "Pat" Weaver, the pioneering 1950s
NBC executive who died in March. Weaver jettisoned the radio model
and took production oversight away from advertisers, adopting a
system in which various sponsors bought time but none of them
possessed editorial control.</TE>
<TE>   "I consciously said it would be better if we build a television
service that was not agency-run, because there you must do what the
client wants," he later explained.</TE>
<TE>   Because broadcasters depend on advertising, sponsors have long
been perceived as the medium's soft underbelly by outside forces
seeking to eradicate certain shows--a weak link targeted by advocates
like L. Brent Bozell III, who runs the Parents Television Council, a
group dedicated to curbing TV's smut level. Having made little
headway with the networks, the organization shifted its attention a
few years ago to sponsors, attempting to shame them away from
programs such as "WWE Smackdown!," "Boston Public" and "The Shield."</TE>
<TE>   "It is simply imperative that those people who are writing the
checks ... take a certain responsibility for these shows," Bozell
said, accusing Hollywood of arrogance in dismissing cultural critics
while urging advertisers to help "put the reins on these
irresponsible people in the creative community." (Parents don't
escape his wrath either, with Bozell calling them "equally
blameworthy" for allowing standards to slide, pointing to a
disconnect between polls in which a vast majority say sex and
violence on television are excessive and surveys showing that more
than 40% of kids have a TV in their bedrooms.)</TE>
<TE>   Backed by the Media Research Center, the Parents Television
Council can be a bit disingenuous in representing its moral outrage
strictly as a crusade for children's welfare when shows such as "The
Shield" play after most kids have gone to bed. Bozell is right,
however, when he argues that trying to hit the industry in its wallet
is a fair means of protesting what's on the air. "It's not
censorship," he said. "It's the exercise of free will."</TE>
<TE>   It's also occasionally effective, for liberals and conservatives
alike, because ad buyers aren't exactly known for their courage when
it comes to controversial material. The alarming difference is that
in the past when sponsors backed out, others could be found to
replace them, while having advertisers snake their way into the
programs potentially alters that equation.</TE>
<TE>   "If the sponsor owns the show, they aren't going to pull out,"
Herskovitz warned. "They're just going to dictate what the content
is."</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, even if advertisers do begin throwing more weight
around, it's unlikely they'll sanitize prime time. Champions of
wholesomeness expressed delight, for example, when ABC said it would
schedule family fare nightly at 8, but "family" these days is a
relative term if ABC applies that label to the upcoming John Ritter
sitcom "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter," in which
Ritter's sexed-up high school brat makes Britney Spears look like
Shirley Temple.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, it's undeniable advertisers' influence grows as they
ooze deeper into content. Just consider radio, where--because
listeners won't be so quick to flip if they hear a familiar
voice--Howard Stern chats about Heineken, Dr. Laura plugs a Toyota
dealership, reporters on all-news stations read ad copy with their
new laser-corrected vision, and talk-show hosts weave testimonials
for a ubiquitous DUI defense attorney into their banter.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever new forms TV advertising takes, given the chance agencies
will grow bolder to ensure everybody knows their brand name--no
longer content to passively hope viewers won't begin channel-surfing
each time a scene ends. Their more aggressive attitude brings to mind
an old cartoon, where one vulture tells another, "To heck with
patience. I'm gonna kill something."</TE>
<TE>   The industry has been shrewd enough to make these advances slowly,
but producers and ad-saturated consumers had best be vigilant,
because the hunger out there is palpable, and the vultures are
circling.</TE>

<HD>At 20, Outfest Has Joined the In Crowd</HD>
<DH>Onetime fringe festival has mainstream clout now but
remains committed to fresh takes on gay life</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN MAYNARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Outfest has come a long way, baby. Since its humble beginnings in
1982 as a fringe media coalition started by a quartet of UCLA-grad
film students, Outfest, the L.A. gay and lesbian film festival, has
skyrocketed into the mainstream as one of the largest and most
successful film festivals in Los Angeles. Over the years, filmmakers
as diverse as Gus Van Sant, Cheryl Dunye, Gregg Araki, Rose Troche
and Todd Haynes have used the festival as a launching pad. And at
Thursday's opening-night gala, highlights from their and others'
films will be featured in a 20th-anniversary retrospective.</LD>
<LD>   "The early '80s were a time when there was pervasive censorship of
the gay and lesbian experience in mainstream media," says Stephen
Gutwillig, executive director of Outfest for the last three years.
"And that is certainly not the case today. Gay and lesbian film
festivals like Outfest, the audiences that support us and the
filmmakers that create the work, share a lot of credit for changing
the visibility of queer lives in the mainstream."</LD>
<TE>   But while this year's Outfest acknowledges and celebrates its past
including screenings of two seminal films from 1982, "Making Love"
and "Lianna," and four programs that depict the impact of AIDS on
film, it also looks to its future. There's still a host of campy
highlights including the "Gong Show" event (fest-goers submit
personal videos and taped oddities from other sources) and
participatory screenings of memorable howlers, this year represented
by "Xanadu" and "Showgirls." What's changed is the festival's canvas.
Showcasing a range of 241 international films from 30 countries as
far apart as Senegal and Slovenia, this year's is the largest and
most international Outfest.</TE>
<TE>   With her film "Guardian of the Frontier," an edgy femme riff on
"Deliverance," director Maja Weiss is not only the first director
from her native Slovenia to depict lesbian relationships, she's the
first female from her country to direct a full-length feature,
period. "While there's rampant homophobia in Slovenia and a
transitioning Eastern Europe, it's a universal subject," she says.
"People from all over have related to it--that's what a good film is
supposed to do."</TE>
<TE>   It's all the more fitting considering that this year's Outfest
Achievement Award is going to Strand Releasing. While not quite as
old as Outfest--Strand is celebrating its 14th year in business--the
indie film company has released more than 100 titles that pushed the
envelope, from Gregg Araki's blistering AIDS road movie "The Living
End" to Francois Ozon's kinky, comic "Criminal Lovers."</TE>
<TE>   The company also has been an Outfest mainstay, and this year is no
exception, with Strand offering four titles including the
awards-night presentation of "The Cockettes," Bill Weber and David
Weissman's documentary about the 1969 San Francisco LSD-dropping drag
queen troupe, and the July 22 closing night feature "Lan Yu," a love
story set in late-1980s Bejing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such a honor," says Strand co-founder Marcus Hu. "We just
wanted to form a company that supported not just gay and lesbian
films but auteur-driven films ... where you really see the hand of
the director in every frame of the movie. We look for visceral
things, and what better thing could there be [than] to be honored by
an organization that promotes visibility of gay films?"</TE>
<TE>   Strand co-founder Jon Gerrans concurs: "It helps justify the
things that we do."</TE>
<TE>   One of the conspicuous omissions at this year's Outfest is
domestic features with theatrical distributors in place. For the
first time, the opening-night gala is a compilation of 20 years of
festival highlights, and the other big-event presentations are either
documentaries or international films. There's no breakout mainstream
feature, no "Trick" or "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" or "Adventures of
Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" as in festivals past. "There's a
definite lull" in terms of higher-profile features, Gutwillig
concedes. "But this will give audiences the chance to see a lot of
great, to-be-discovered features."</TE>
<TE>   For a festival celebrating its 20th birthday, Outfest's biggest
trend this year seems to be breaking from tradition. Some familiar
indie faces are returning but in different ways. Director Jamie
Babbit showcased her feature "But I'm a Cheerleader" in 2000, but
this year she returns to Outfest with a black-comedy short called
"Stuck," about the literal crossroads that emerge between a
senior-citizen lesbian couple. Babbit says the shorts program is a
great calling card to get attention from Hollywood heavyweights. "One
of the reasons I wanted to do a short was to do something darker in
tone than 'Cheerleader,' " says Babbit. "But I think it can be more
than just a calling card. I really like the short-film format because
I love short stories."</TE>
<TE>   Filmmakers are looking for stories that break away from
traditional gay story lines like coming out or living with HIV. One
of the most anticipated programs this year is "Bob &amp; Rose," from
"Queer as Folk" creator Russell T. Davies. The six-episode British TV
anthology is a more lighthearted romantic drama about a gay man who
falls for a straight woman.</TE>
<TE>   "This actually happened to me. A friend of mine starting going out
with a woman, and I thought he was having a nervous breakdown," says
Davies. "And then I sat down with them and talked about it and
realized I had been laughing at a genuine love story. So I thought
the prejudice that I and every other gay man in Manchester showed was
fascinating."</TE>
<TE>   Director Laura Nix, who has two Outfest entries, the
Fassbinder-inspired lesbian melodrama "The Politics of Fur" and
"Whether You Like It or Not," a documentary about the making of
"Hedwig," also wanted to bust the cliches of gay and lesbian
filmmaking. "I think that a lot of times lesbian and gay films can
fall into a polemic of a need to show a really positive lifestyle,"
She says. "And with 'The Politics of Fur,' I really wanted to show a
darker side of lesbian relationships. We should have access to the
range that every other audience has."</TE>
<TE>   While director Sherman Alexie ("Smoke Signals") is straight, his
new film "The Business of Fancy Dancing," which tells the story of a
gay Native American poet who returns to his reservation for the
funeral of a childhood friend, touches on a side of gay life we
haven't seen before.</TE>
<TE>   "The gay world and the Indian society certainly hasn't been
talking about it at all," says Alexie. "We started talking about the
ways in which all of our ethnic, cultural, and sexual identities put
us into tribes. And how many tribes can you belong to at one time?
We've played gay festivals, straight festivals and Indian
reservations. It's been interesting to see the different tribes
coming to the movie and sitting in different sections."</TE>
<TE>   Outfest still has more to conquer as the festival looks ahead,
Gutwillig says. "The AFI came out with its list of 100 great love
stories, and there wasn't a single gay film on the list," he says.
"Where was 'My Beautiful Laundrette'? 'Desert Hearts'? 'Beautiful
Thing'? We are certainly a generation removed from the de facto media
blackout that existed when Outfest was founded, but there's still a
hesitation to embrace the moral equivalence of our romance and our
desire. We still have a long way to go for all of us to be seen."</TE>

<LD>   Hasselhoff in Rehab for Alcohol, Publicist Says</LD>
<LD>   David Hasselhoff has checked himself into the Betty Ford Center
for treatment of alcoholism, according to his publicist. The former
"Baywatch" star, who turns 50 next week, issued a release Monday
announcing the voluntary stay at the hospital.</LD>
<TE>   "He realized his social drinking had increased more than he was
comfortable with and he decided to do something about it," read the
statement from Richard Hoffman.</TE>
<TE>   The actor checked in June 26, but his representatives did not know
when he planned to check out. Hasselhoff's recent roles included a
cameo appearance as himself in the summer comedy "The New Guy," and
he performed on Broadway last year in the musical "Jekyll &amp; Hyde."</TE>

<TE>   Madonna to Cameo in New Bond Film</TE>
<TE>   Madonna will make a cameo appearance in the latest James Bond
movie, her spokeswoman said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Liz Rosenberg said the singer, 43, who has already recorded the
title track for "Die Another Day," the 20th Bond film, was on the set
in London to film her brief scenes this week.</TE>
<TE>   London's Evening Standard newspaper said Madonna will wield a foil
in the movie as a fencing instructor. The newspaper said she had shot
a sequence that will be edited into a swashbuckling scene in which
Pierce Brosnan, as Bond, duels with villain Gustav Graves, played by
Toby Stephens, at a London gentlemen's club.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg said Madonna was flying to Los Angeles next month to
film a video for the movie's title song.</TE>

<TE>   'N Sync's Fatone Set for Broadway Debut</TE>
<TE>   The boys of 'N Sync are keeping busy during hiatus. Lance Bass is
negotiating with the Russian Space Agency to become the next space
tourist, and Joey Fatone will make his Broadway debut this summer in
the long-running production of "Rent."</TE>
<TE>   According to the New York Times, Fatone will take on the role of
Mark, a struggling video artist and narrator of the show. His first
public performance in the role is scheduled for Aug. 5, continuing
through Dec. 22. "It's nice to have a chance to play a character, not
be myself," Fatone told the Times.</TE>
<TE>   "Rent" has been running at the Nederlander Theater for more than
six years, with ticket sales slowing in recent years. Producers hope
that Fatone will tap into a whole new audience for the production.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmanson's Puzo Moves to USC</TE>
<TE>   Madeline Puzo, associate producer of the Ahmanson Theatre since
1995 and of the Mark Taper Forum from 1981-89, is the new dean of the
USC School of Theatre, replacing the retiring Robert Scales. In
recent years Puzo produced such plays as Peter Hall's staging of
"Measure for Measure," Anna Deavere Smith's "House Arrest" and the

<LD>Just because you're in the wilderness, there's no reason to rough it.</LD>
<LD>   That seems to be the sentiment behind the accommodations in "Great
Lodges of the National Parks," a four-part PBS series starting
tonight (and continuing Wednesdays through July 31 at 8 p.m.).</LD>
<LD>   Tonight's installment visits Yellowstone's Old Faithful Inn and
Yosemite's Ahwahnee Hotel. Both lodgings were designed to blend in
with, rather than stand out from, their natural surroundings, while
capturing the parks' scale and grandeur. The Old Faithful Inn, which
opened in 1904 mere footsteps from the Old Faithful geyser, was
constructed from hundreds of native lodgepole pines and tons of
rocks. The 76 1/2-foot-high lobby is a dark and woodsy open space
lighted by a massive stone fireplace. The rooms are rustic, with log
walls and ceilings and bathrooms down the hall. However, we are
assured the amenities are first-class.</LD>
<TE>   Yosemite's lavish Ahwahnee Hotel's claim of reflecting the
surrounding wilderness is more tenuous--though visitors can gaze at
ice sculpture models of the landmark Half Dome while sipping
afternoon tea in the solarium. The elegant hotel, built in 1927,
boasts "English country home" furnishings, including buttery yellow
walls, fine antique furniture and Oriental rugs.</TE>
<TE>   On the outside, the Ahwahnee sports massive granite columns
mimicking nearby cliffs. Inside, though, it is nothing short of posh,
right down to the tuxedoed chap playing the grand piano. Coat and tie
required for dinner, of course. For those who prefer to spot a bear
through a window rather than a tent flap (gin and tonic in hand), it
may be the perfect spot.</TE>
<TE>   Like the lodges, the show meanders from its focus at times,
spending too much time on ho-hum maintenance at the Old Faithful Inn
and on the medieval English-style Christmas festivities at the
Ahwahnee. Both the show and the lodges would do well to get a little
more back to nature.</TE>

<LD>The Fourth of July holiday week traditionally prompts a plunge in TV
viewing levels to their annual nadir, and the latest edition was no
exception, with CBS riding reruns of its Sunday and Monday lineups to
ratings victory, based on viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen
Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   While CBS relied on the likes of "60 Minutes" and "Everybody Loves
Raymond" as well as reruns of the movie "A Time to Kill" and "Murder,
She Wrote," some of this summer's unscripted replacement series also
continue to post solid ratings, including NBC's "Dog Eat Dog" and
"Crime &amp; Punishment" and Fox's twice-weekly talent contest "American
Idol," which topped all programs last week among adults age 18 to 49,
the key demographic in the eyes of advertisers.</LD>
<LD>   That said, results have been less promising for a number of other
replacement shows, including ABC's "The Mole II" and Fox's "Beyond
Belief."</LD>
<TE>   Fox also received a boost from its prime-time broadcast of the
"Pepsi 400" NASCAR race, which generated the network's biggest
Saturday night audience since April.</TE>
<TE>   Just more than half of TV sets were in use during prime-time last
week, a 5% drop compared with the previous week.</TE>

<TE>   National Nielsen Viewership</TE>
<TE>   Here are the rankings for national prime-time network television
last week (July 1-7) as compiled by Nielsen Media Research. They are
based on the average number of people who watched a program from
start to finish. Nielsen estimates there are 269 million potential
viewers in the U.S. age 2 and older. Viewership is listed in
millions.</TE>

<HD>Protesters Disrupt Thompson's Remarks at AIDS Conference</HD>
<DH>Demonstration: To address the 14th such international
forum, the U.S. health secretary must overcome a hail of jeers and
whistles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BARCELONA, Spain</DL>
<LD>In a scene reminiscent of the early days of the AIDS epidemic,
activists stormed the stage Tuesday and obstructed a speech by U.S.
Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson at the 14th
International AIDS Conference.</LD>
<LD>   Thompson stoically delivered his 20-minute talk, but the only
people who heard it were the security men who separated him from the
demonstrators.</LD>
<LD>   "We know what he is going to say, and we are tired of his lies,"
said Asia Russell of ACT UP, one of the organizers of the
demonstration.</LD>
<TE>   Italian activists later shut down a large booth run by U.S. drug
company Gilead Sciences, protesting that the company would
communicate with only physicians in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Another group had shut down a booth run by Hoffmann-La Roche on
Monday. The activists are planning a protest against Coca-Cola today
because the company, one of the largest employers in Africa, does not
provide AIDS health care to all its employees.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson had gotten only a few words out of his mouth Tuesday when
about 25 protesters broke into the room, blowing shrill whistles and
shouting, "Shame, shame!"</TE>
<TE>   Thompson stopped talking and, after about 15 minutes, the
protesters left. But when he began speaking again, they returned,
resuming their loud activities with an assist from some members of
the audience.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Thompson finished his speech, took a sip of water and
walked off the stage. After he left, other speakers were able to
deliver their talks without problems.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States is passionately committed to this international
fight," Thompson told reporters backstage.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand that people are passionate about this and want to
blame the United States," he said. "But the United States under
President Bush has doubled the amount of resources it provides for
the fight against AIDS."</TE>
<TE>   The activists charge that the U.S. contribution to a new global
AIDS fund, as well as to other international and national programs,
is pitifully low. Russell said that as a proportion of its gross
national product, the United States' contribution is even less than
that of Uganda, the East African nation that is one of the world's
poorest countries.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's 2001 budget for international HIV/AIDS
efforts was $726 million, and the proposed budget for next year is
$1.3 billion. UNAIDS, the United Nations' program on HIV/AIDS,
projects that at least $10 billion a year is necessary for AIDS
programs, but it has so far received commitments of less than $3
billion for this year.</TE>
<TE>   Activists are also incensed by the Bush administration's
opposition to needle exchange programs, which are a proven method of
preventing the spread of AIDS, and by its insistence on abstinence as
the primary goal of prevention programs.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson was accompanied to Barcelona by Dr. Louis Sullivan, who
held the same job during the administration of George H.W. Bush.
Sullivan spoke at the San Francisco International AIDS Conference in
1990 and was jeered loudly then. Thompson is the only U.S.
Cabinet-level official to have attended an overseas AIDS conference.</TE>

<HD>Strides Made in Fighting HIV in Newborns</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Anti-AIDS drugs have greatly reduced infections
in U.S. babies, agency says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BARCELONA, Spain</DL>
<LD>In one of the great triumphs of the fight against AIDS, physicians
have reduced the number of U.S. infants born with HIV infections by
80% since 1991, according to the latest estimates from the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</LD>
<LD>   But experts cautioned Tuesday that the numbers could rise again
without new prevention programs because the drugs being used are not
100% effective.</LD>
<LD>   About 1,760 HIV-positive infants were born in the United States in
1991, but only an estimated 280 to 370 in 2000, Dr. Patricia Fleming
of the CDC told the 14th International AIDS Conference.</LD>
<TE>   That reduction, attributed to widespread treatment of pregnant
women with anti-AIDS drugs, "clearly demonstrates remarkable
progress," said Dr. Harold Jaffe, who heads the CDC's HIV prevention
programs.</TE>
<TE>   In general, only about 2% of infants born to HIV-positive women
contract the virus if the mother is diagnosed before birth and
receives a cocktail of anti-AIDS drugs.</TE>
<TE>   If the mother receives no therapy, however, the transmission rate
rockets to 25%.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming's study found that about 129,500 to 135,300 American women
ages 13 through 44 were HIV positive in 2000, the most recent year
for which figures are available. The comparable number in 1991 was
80,000.</TE>
<TE>   The HIV-positive women gave birth to an estimated 6,075 to 6,422
infants in 2000. Based on the best statistical measures for the
percentage of women treated and the transmission rate, Fleming's
group reached the new estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming cautioned that it would be difficult to get the numbers
much lower because the treatment isn't always effective. An estimated
120 to 130 HIV-positive babies still would have been born even if all
the pregnant women had received treatment, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The number of infected babies is likely to grow in the future
because of the rise in new infections among women.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming called for new prevention programs, saying, "The simple
fact is that the best way to prevent new infections in babies is to
prevent infections in women."</TE>
<TE>   Pregnant women in the rest of the world are not faring as well. In
most developing countries, the only available treatment for pregnant
women is a short course of the anti-AIDS drugs nevirapine or
zidovudine shortly before birth, with perhaps a short treatment for
the infant as well.</TE>
<TE>   Very few women actually receive such treatment, however, and an
estimated 5.1 million children worldwide have been born infected. The
Bush administration recently announced that it was hoping to donate
$200 million for next year to support such interventions.</TE>
<TE>   One of the few successes at interrupting mother-to-infant
transmission in developing nations is taking place in Thailand. Thai
officials reported here this week that, in the first year of a new
program, two-thirds of HIV-positive pregnant women received
zidovudine from the 34th week of gestation until delivery.</TE>
<TE>   Officials do not yet know how successful the program is, said Dr.
Pornsinee Amornwichet of the Thai Ministry of Public Health, but
pilot programs found that the regimen halved transmission.</TE>

<LD>A socialist and ex-coca farmer has finished a surprising second in
Bolivia's presidential vote and will compete in a two-man runoff in
Congress in August, according to final election results released
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Evo Morales, an Aymara Indian and foe of U.S. foreign policy, will
face off against Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, the center-right
candidate of the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement, who finished
first with 22.5% of the vote in an 11-candidate field. Morales got
20.94%</LD>
<LD>   Morales wants an end to U.S.-backed programs to eradicate the
cultivation of coca leaves, used to make both cocaine and Andean
remedies. U.S. Ambassador Manuel Rocha has suggested that a Morales
presidency would lead to the end of U.S. aid to Bolivia.</LD>
<TE>   Morales edged out Manfred Reyes Villa for second place by 721
votes out of 2.8 million cast.</TE>

<LD>   A 20-month investigation has concluded that Poles, not their Nazi
occupiers, carried out the 1941 massacre of as many as 1,600 Jews in
the village of Jedwabne, but prosecutors said there was no evidence
to bring new charges.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutor Radoslaw Ignatiew said a band of 40 men, armed with
sticks, rounded up local Jews, killing some and driving others into a
barn and burning it. However, he said, evidence had turned up no
perpetrators other than the 12 convicted in 1949 for aiding Germans.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Ex-Chief Faces Accusers in '71 Deaths</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Smiling and proclaiming his innocence, former President Luis
Echeverria Alvarez waded into an unruly crowd of accusers Tuesday and
endured shouts of "Murderer! Murderer!" after a special prosecutor
grilled him about his role in a 1971 student massacre.</LD>
<LD>   "Many people don't like you," a reporter told the 80-year-old
former leader as scores of demonstrators jostled him on the street
outside the prosecutor's office here.</LD>
<LD>   "I know, man," Echeverria replied with a laugh. "I feel the same
way about them."</LD>
<TE>   The seven-minute mob scene was a sign of the times in Mexico,
where elections in 2000 ended 71 years of rule by the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, and the untouchable status of the
nation's leaders. President Vicente Fox has appointed the prosecutor,
Ignacio Carrillo Prieto, to bring former officials to justice for
human rights abuses.</TE>
<TE>   But it also was clear that Echeverria, who ruled from 1970 to
1976, sought Tuesday's street confrontation and relished it.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor is hearing complaints by former student
leaders--men and women now in their 50s--that Echeverria ordered the
bloody repression of two student demonstrations in Mexico City. The
first occurred in 1968, when Echeverria was in charge of Mexico's
internal security, and the other in 1971, when he was president.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 300 people died in the first, at least 30 in the
second. Both massacres were landmarks in the slow erosion of the
PRI's grip on Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Echeverria made an initial appearance before Carrillo on July 2,
becoming the first sitting or former Mexican president to testify as
a potential defendant in a criminal complaint. He slipped in and out
of the building through an underground garage to avoid demonstrators
and made no comment on the hearing, which focused on the 1968 deaths.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the former president was on the offensive. His lawyer,
Antonio Cuellar, said before the hearing that the accusers were
former guerrillas and criminals who now "want to present themselves
as victims."</TE>
<TE>   Salvador Martinez de la Rocca, a student leader in 1971 who
attended the hearing as a prosecutor's advisor, said Echeverria may
have provoked Tuesday's street scene so that he could later argue
that it would be unsafe for him to appear in court again.</TE>
<TE>   But Echeverria told a radio station that he welcomed the chance to
clear his name under oath. He said he was eager to face one of his
main accusers, Alfonso Martinez Dominguez.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez was the appointed mayor of Mexico City on June 10, 1971,
when a paramilitary group called the Falcons opened fire on 8,000
students who were marching to demand democratic reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Echeverria fired Martinez, implicitly blaming him for the deaths.
Years later, Martinez claimed that the president had orchestrated the
shooting. The ex-mayor has been called to testify next Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In Tuesday's 2 1/2-hour hearing, Echeverria sat in tense silence
as the prosecutor asked him 159 questions, including: Who paid the
Falcons? Why was none of them arrested? What happened to the
investigation you promised?</TE>
<TE>   As he did last week, the former president asked for and got 40
days to respond to the questions in writing before the prosecutor
decides whether to go to trial.</TE>
<TE>   Then Echeverria went outside and waved, catching his accusers off
guard. "The people condemn you!" someone shouted.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by a reporter whether he felt prison was near, the
octogenarian replied, "It's very, very far."</TE>

<HD>Peres Continues Talks in the Mideast</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Israelis close university office of a top
Palestinian moderate. Gunman attacks police.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli and Palestinian leaders held a second day of high-level talks
Tuesday, even as Israel shut down the office of a leading Palestinian
moderate and a gunman attacked Israeli police in Jerusalem.</LD>
<LD>   Early in the day, Israeli police raided Al Quds University in Abu
Dis, a suburb of East Jerusalem, and closed the office of the
president, Sari Nusseibeh, the top Palestinian official in Jerusalem
and an outspoken moderate who has criticized suicide bombings.</LD>
<LD>   Nusseibeh was in Greece when the raid took place. Israeli Public
Security Minister Uzi Landau said the university is part of the "long
arm of the Palestinian Authority, operating against the law."</LD>
<TE>   Despite the raid, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres talked
with new ministers in the Cabinet of Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Peres met with Interior Minister Abdel Razak Yehiyeh and Local
Affairs Minister Saeb Erekat, who has served as a senior negotiator
in past talks with Israel. On Monday, Peres met with Finance Minister
Salam Fayed.</TE>
<TE>   Erekat said that at Tuesday's meeting, the Palestinians demanded
an end to the Israeli military takeover of seven of eight main
Palestinian towns and cities, while the Israelis sought a halt to
Palestinian suicide bombings and other attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Peres' office said that the meeting was positive and that both
sides recognized the need to continue talks, which had all but
stopped in 21 months of violence.</TE>
<TE>   Despite low expectations, the resumption of dialogue provided a
rare glimmer of hope that the two sides may be able to revive
peacemaking. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said that although
peace "looks distant at this time, it seems to me that maybe some
type of window has been opened."</TE>
<TE>   The White House later said President Bush had spoken by telephone
to Sharon and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah and urged them to pursue
peace. At a news conference Monday, Bush reiterated his demand for
Palestinian reforms, but he also said progress had been made and
called on Israel to reciprocate by easing some curbs on the movement
of Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   As talks continued, Israel swore in Lt. Gen. Moshe Yaalon as the
army's new chief of staff, replacing Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz. Yaalon had
been Mofaz's deputy and is expected to continue his predecessor's
hard line against Palestinian violence.</TE>
<TE>   In the shooting Tuesday in Jerusalem, the gunman fled after firing
on a group of Israeli police officers and wounding one of them at an
entrance to the Old City.</TE>
<TE>   "The assailant tried to escape. Police fired several shots at him.
He returned fire and hit a Palestinian passerby, who was killed,"
police said. Police later said they arrested the suspected gunman
after a search.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Palestinian sources said Israeli troops killed Islamic
Jihad militant Muannar Qassin Daraghmeh, 22, after they stopped his
car near the West Bank city of Jenin. The army said it knew of no
such incident.</TE>

<HD>Army Says Video May Solve Disputed Attack</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Army said Tuesday that an AC-130 gunship involved in a
controversial airstrike on a remote Afghan village took video footage
that could shed light on the deadly incident.</LD>
<LD>   The Afghan government says U.S. warplanes killed 48 people and
wounded 117 early July 1 when they mistook celebratory firing at a
wedding party in the central province of Oruzgan for hostile fire.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. military insists that its planes came under antiaircraft
fire from the ground. It has admitted that civilians were killed and
has promised a formal investigation.</LD>
<TE>   "We have said we were engaged with antiaircraft artillery," Maj.
Gary Tallman said. "I can tell you with certainty [that video
evidence] will be used to determine if in fact we were."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. military has said that a Special Forces team on the
ground called in the airstrike after pinpointing several sources of
the antiaircraft fire.</TE>
<TE>   However, a joint U.S.-Afghan team that visited the site of the
main attack last week said it found no sign of an antiaircraft
gun--although the team did collect shell casings and shrapnel that
will form part of the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Tallman said the footage had been viewed by the U.S. commander,
Lt. Gen. Dan McNeill, and then sent to the Central Command in Tampa,
Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the United Nations said its own investigation showed
that a "large number of civilians" were killed in the airstrike but
that none of three villages visited by a joint U.N.-Afghan team was
destroyed.</TE>

<HD>Afghan Mourners Voice Doubts About Justice</HD>
<DH>Asia: Some are skeptical that the vice president's killers
will be caught. The government now faces the highly political task of

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Afghan flags flew at half-staff throughout the country and radio
programs were banned from playing music during a national day of
mourning Tuesday for slain Vice President Haji Abdul Qadir, even as
many Afghans expressed doubts that his killers would be caught.</LD>
<LD>   In particular, many of Qadir's fellow ethnic Pushtuns said they
believed that the case would be treated much like that of Air
Transportation and Tourism Minister Abdul Rahman, who was slain Feb.
14. Then, the government pledged to bring the killers to justice and
even named suspects, but the key figures were not arrested.</LD>
<LD>   "They will not find the murderers of Haji Qadir," said Shamal
Hoda, 25, a medical student who attended the prayers held Tuesday for
Qadir at a mosque in central Kabul. "It will be the same as it was
with Minister Abdul Rahman. In that case, the murderers are known,
but they are not arrested.</LD>
<TE>   "Those who killed Haji Qadir are supported by great powers," Hoda
said. "He was killed in the middle of Kabul."</TE>
<TE>   President Hamid Karzai attended the prayers, along with hundreds
of other Afghans, and said he had lost "my brother and my right
hand." He promised Qadir's family and friends that the killers would
be brought to justice.</TE>
<TE>   Qadir was slain Saturday by a pair of gunmen as he drove away from
his office in Kabul, the Afghan capital.</TE>
<TE>   A close examination of the many people who might have killed him
reads like a litany of Afghanistan's problems and the difficulties
facing the new government as it attempts to impose the rule of law.</TE>
<TE>   Suspects include ethnic rivals; drug dealers who lost money as a
result of Qadir's policies; outside provocateurs, such as warlord
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar or former Taliban members; and members of the
predominantly ethnic Tajik Northern Alliance, who helped oust the
Taliban from Kabul last year.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan police authorities, who are predominantly Tajiks, say they
are pursuing the case, but it is hard to get specifics about what
they are doing. Police quickly arrested 10 security guards posted at
the Ministry of Public Works, which was near the site of the
assassination, but few people believe that they are the culprits. Two
other men were arrested later, but little is known about them.</TE>
<TE>   Kabul Police Chief Gen. Abdul Basir, a former Northern Alliance
commander, said his investigation was focusing on Hekmatyar and on
the family of Commander Shomali, a warlord in eastern Afghanistan.
Basir said he was leaning toward the theory that the former was
responsible.</TE>
<TE>   "Gulbuddin is a prime suspect; he wants to show the world and
Afghanistan that there is no security and no peace and that even the
deputy to the president can be killed," Basir said.</TE>
<TE>   However, he could cite no evidence pointing to Hekmatyar, the head
of a militant Islamic party that opposes the presence in Afghanistan
of foreign troops with the U.S.-led coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Western diplomats and knowledgeable observers say it is unlikely
that Hekmatyar, the Taliban or the Al Qaeda terrorist network is
responsible.</TE>
<TE>   "Al Qaeda and Hekmatyar are such convenient excuses," one diplomat
said. "You have to ask: Who benefits from [Qadir's] death, and it
certainly looks as if the Northern Alliance does, since they would
like to have someone they like govern Nangarhar" province, where
Qadir was still governor when he was slain.</TE>
<TE>   This is Afghanistan at its most shadowy, filled with internecine
rivalries and cross-cutting agendas</TE>
<TE>   As one of five vice presidents, Qadir was the highest-ranking
ethnic Pushtun in the government, other than Karzai. He was also the
minister of public works. His province, Nangarhar, is one of the
wealthiest in Afghanistan because of its border with Pakistan, which
makes it a smugglers' haven, and its poppy cultivation, which is used
to produce opium and heroin. Many people would have liked his access
to customs tariffs and his influence over the drug trade. He
reportedly had been involved in both smuggling and the poppy
business.</TE>
<TE>   Although Qadir was a member of the Northern Alliance, he sought to
limit its influence in eastern Afghanistan. Other leaders from the
region, notably warlord Hazrat Ali, are closer to Defense Minister
Mohammed Qassim Fahim, a Tajik.</TE>
<TE>   Northern Alliance officials denied that they had reason to
undercut Qadir, saying that such a suggestion was propaganda imported
from Pakistan aimed at sowing discord.</TE>
<TE>   "Inasmuch as we know, Haji Qadir was very nice and good, he was
working with the Northern Alliance and we didn't have any problem
with him," said Hafiz Hakim, a member of the Northern Alliance and an
official in the Department of Intelligence, which is involved in
investigating the case,</TE>
<TE>   Each possible explanation in Qadir's death has its own set of
difficulties when it comes to capturing and prosecuting the killers.
Perhaps in tacit recognition of the obstacles facing Afghan
officials, Karzai requested the help of the International Security
Assistance Force, and it was quickly granted.</TE>
<TE>   Finding the killers is only one of the government's problems.
Because Qadir held three posts, each must be filled and each
represents a highly political decision. Already, Qadir's relatives
and local warlords are jockeying for the jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Many Pushtuns made it clear that they suspected political motives
in the killing. Although none felt comfortable pointing fingers
explicitly at the Northern Alliance, they raised doubts about every
other option.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, a street near the mosque where the prayers for Qadir
were held was teeming with turbaned Pushtuns who had traveled far,
some for as many as two days over rugged roads, to pay their
respects. Typical of the mourners was Mohammed Hossain Hassan, 70,
who had come from Konar province in the far northeast. "To my mind,
this was a political assassination," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Haji Qadir was the leader of the whole Pushtun nation. Opium
dealers and rivals from Jalalabad [the capital of Nangarhar] could
have killed him there any day, but he was killed here in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   "And I refuse to believe it was Gulbuddin; there are other people
he would have wanted to kill first. It was political," he repeated as
he climbed into a car, preparing to start the journey back home.</TE>

<HD>Egypt Sees U.S. Going Cairo's Way</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Washington's extradition of a man convicted of
conspiring in Anwar Sadat's assassination is viewed by many as
validation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>For five years, the United States steadfastly refused to send Nabil
Soliman back to Egypt, where he had been convicted in absentia of
helping assassinate President Anwar Sadat.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. law prohibits deporting anyone to a country where prisoners
might be tortured. But last month, Soliman landed in Cairo and was
handed over for a retrial on charges connected with the 1981 slaying.</LD>
<LD>   What changed? U.S. officials say Egypt promised not to torture the
man. But many here say that U.S. priorities changed, not Egypt's
intentions.</LD>
<TE>   "After Sept. 11, the Egyptian government became very happy," said
Hafez abu Saeda, general secretary of the Egyptian Organization for
Human Rights. "Western countries and the U.S. have begun to cooperate
with Egyptian security."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, when the U.S. Embassy in Cairo announced that
Soliman--who had been held by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service--had been returned, U.S. Ambassador C. David Welch said in a
statement that it was "another example of the close U.S.-Egyptian
cooperation in the war against terror."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of whether people in the Arab world accept or reject
U.S. policies, and most would say they fall into the negative camp,
America has long served as a model of due process and the rule of
law.</TE>
<TE>   Many people here had hoped that those characteristics would
someday rub off on Egypt, a nation the U.S. calls "moderate" and
local human rights activists describe as an authoritarian police
state.</TE>
<TE>   But in the post-Sept. 11 world, with the U.S. contemplating
military tribunals for civilians, limiting civil rights of suspects
and demonstrating a new willingness to deport fugitives such as
Soliman, many here see the U.S. as coming more into line with the
justice systems of the developing world rather than the other way
around.</TE>
<TE>   Though U.S. officials say they have only tinkered at the margins
of their nation's civil liberties, the actions threaten to
reverberate throughout Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   The government of President Hosni Mubarak appears to view the U.S.
moves as validating its approach to running Egypt. In fact, the main
government spokesman seems almost giddy when he talks about the way
the United States once criticized Egypt's human rights record,
especially its propensity for putting civilians in front of state
security courts.</TE>
<TE>   "Now in America, you are putting only non-Americans in front of
military courts," said Nabil Osman, the spokesman. "Here, we don't
discriminate."</TE>
<TE>   Farid Zahran has been outspoken since his student days in Cairo in
the 1970s, when he was repeatedly arrested and jailed for promoting
leftist ideologies. Even after Mubarak declared a state of emergency
in 1981 to help fight the Islamic extremists who had slain Sadat,
Zahran continued to criticize the system.</TE>
<TE>   But Zahran says he had never experienced anything like what
happened to him Sept. 20, when he was arrested, interrogated for
seven hours and then held for two weeks in solitary confinement. His
offense was helping to organize an anti-American demonstration
outside the U.S. Embassy on Sept. 10.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was arrested, they were screaming, 'This is a terrorist,
this is a terrorist!' " he recalled. "It is the fashion of the
moment."</TE>
<TE>   And who does Zahran blame for his rough treatment? America. Since
Sept. 11, Egypt has clamped down on public gatherings and
demonstrations--and, according to human rights groups, detained
hundreds of Islamic fundamentalists.</TE>
<TE>   In what may seem an unfair yet predictable twist, Egypt's
post-Sept. 11 clampdown has only increased the widespread resentment
of America. Many Egyptians think that the U.S. is supporting a regime
that crushes dissenting voices and limits individual liberties
because to do so suits Washington's interests. They see a double
standard in President Bush's demand that the Palestinians overhaul a
system in which power is in the hands of "an unaccountable few."</TE>
<TE>   "I doubt the U.S. really wants democracy around the world," said
Mohammed Zarei, 37, a lawyer who founded the Human Rights Center for
the Assistance of Prisoners and has also been arrested, imprisoned
and tortured for his political views. "If there was democracy in
Egypt, and people would be free to choose, probably [Mubarak's party]
would not be in power. The Islamists would control parliament and
government, and that is against what America wants."</TE>
<TE>   Egypt has been battling Islamic extremists for decades. When Sadat
was president, he supported and encouraged the Muslim Brotherhood, a
relatively moderate Islamic political party that has operated in the
region for decades, on the theory that the movement would counter
Communists and leftists.</TE>
<TE>   When Islamic fundamentalists gunned down Sadat, his successor,
Mubarak, outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood and imposed the state of
emergency.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years later, Mubarak's Egypt is still in a state of
emergency, a condition that even the U.S. acknowledges restricts
"many basic rights."</TE>
<TE>   The State Department's assessment of human rights in Egypt in 2001
said the country had made some progress with regard to extrajudicial
killings, torture deaths and punishing police who killed through
torture, but it added that the "government's record remained poor
with respect to freedom of expression and its continued referral of
citizens to trial in military or State Security Emergency courts."</TE>
<TE>   The government says the state of emergency is necessary to control
radical fundamentalists, who it says want to turn Egypt into a
radical Islamic state on the order of Iran. Government officials
insist that the restrictions are aimed at controlling Islamists, not
civil society.</TE>
<TE>   But groups across the political spectrum charge that Egypt's
leadership is trying to stifle opposing political views, in a process
that has only grown bolder since Sept. 11, they say. Human rights
groups, for example, point to a new law regulating nongovernmental
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The law requires groups to get government permission if they are
to operate legally, prohibits any activity that is considered
"political" and bars groups from taking money from abroad unless they
obtain permission.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak signed the law one day before his recent visit to the
White House.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone knew he signed it, and everyone knew that no one in the
States would ask him about this," Zahran said. "Hosni Mubarak can go
on television now and say, 'We told you before--you need to focus on
terrorism, and you talk about human rights.' "</TE>
<TE>   Zahran describes himself as a leftist. Zarei says he is a
Nasserist, or a pan-Arab nationalist. And their colleague in
opposition to the government, Magdy Hussein, says he is an Islamist.
But they all agree on one thing: The United States took the wrong
message away from Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   They say that countries such as Egypt bred men like Osama bin
Laden and his lieutenant Ayman Zawahiri. The radicalism that took
hold in parts of their community, they all say, is a direct reaction
to limited freedoms.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the outcome of the dictatorship. There is no safe way to
practice politics. You must be an agent of the state," said Hussein,
whose paper was shut down, and political party dissolved by the
courts, after he repeatedly criticized two government ministers.</TE>
<TE>   "Extremists come from repressive regimes," said Abu Saeda, the
human rights worker, who was recently arrested because his group took
money from Britain for human rights work. "I say if we had space for
political movements, like the Islamist movement, to raise their
voice, to have a party, this will limit extremism."</TE>
<TE>   But the government dismisses such talk.</TE>
<TE>   "What befell the United States of America in September was not a
product of lack of freedom, lack of democracy or lack of free press
or whatever," spokesman Osman said. "This is, to say the least, an
oversimplification."</TE>

<HD>Ford Motor Co. Starts Up Its Own Plant in Russia</HD>
<DH>Business: The facility is the first fully foreign- owned
auto factory in the nation, which car makers see as one of the last
untapped markets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. officially launched the first fully foreign-owned
automotive plant in Russia on Tuesday, a precedent that experts hope
will pave the way for other global businesses to set up manufacturing
here.</LD>
<LD>   The new $150-million plant outside St. Petersburg, which initially
will employ 400 production workers and 400 support staff, is a signal
to other manufacturers that Russia has emerged from the economic
downturn of the late 1990s and is safe for direct foreign investment,
officials and analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a big fleet of 40 cars now on the street," declared
Henrik Nenzen, a Swede who is president of Ford Russia. The vehicles
are being tested and evaluated, he said, with the first Russian-built
Fords making their way to consumers by late September.</LD>
<TE>   Ford, the world's No. 2 auto maker, is not the only U.S. car
company eyeing the Russian market.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors Corp. has entered into a $300-million investment
with Russia's AvtoVAZ. GM is helping AvtoVAZ produce an upgraded Niva
sport-utility vehicle in the Samara region of southern Russia. The
vehicle will be marketed under the Chevrolet brand name.</TE>
<TE>   Russians have long complained that the West has been quick with
advice and promises but slow with direct investment, especially
outside the oil-and-gas industry.</TE>
<TE>   In that sense, the Ford opening "is a really great event for the
country," said Nina Oding, a senior analyst at St. Petersburg's
Leontief Economic Research Institute, because it offers new
industrial growth and employment. "We are talking here about direct
investment, not simply some form of credits like our governors enjoy
bragging about.</TE>
<TE>   "This means an exchange of technology and production and
administrative discipline--things important for Russia now," she
added. "It also creates jobs for workers dreaming of good and stable
pay, a workable system of bonuses and other benefits."</TE>
<TE>   Line workers will make the equivalent of $220 a month, and skilled
engineers up to $600, Nenzen said. For that pay level, Ford turned
away many applicants and was able to put together a highly educated,
dedicated work force, he said. The average monthly wage in Russia is
$134, according to the World Bank.</TE>
<TE>   The Ford plant is in Vsevolozhsk, about 15 miles northeast of
downtown St. Petersburg. It is believed to be the first case of a
foreign company setting up a large industrial factory in the country
without Russian partners. Nenzen stressed that it is not simply an
assembly plant, putting together nearly completed portions of
automobiles, imported from elsewhere, but a full-fledged factory with
its own body welding, paint and final assembly sections.</TE>
<TE>   Despite reports of stifling bureaucracy and corruption on the
Russian business scene, Nenzen said, Ford's experience was no more or
less difficult than inaugurating a plant in any other European
country. "The building here started to be built in the summer of
2000. So it is not a long period," he noted.</TE>
<TE>   The plant will manufacture four-door, hatchback and station wagon
versions of the popular Ford Focus. Since the vehicles will be made
in Russia, the company will not have to pay the 25% duty applied to
imported cars.</TE>
<TE>   "Our prices will become much, much more attractive, and our sales
volume will go up," Nenzen said.</TE>
<TE>   The plant is able to produce 25,000 cars a year with a potential
for further expansion to 100,000. Cars made in Russia will be priced
from about $10,900, compared with nearly $14,000 if imported.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for duty-free status, Ford agreed to make sure that
50% of the car components come from Russia within five years, meaning
the plant will have a ripple benefit for the Russian economy. So far,
the Russian component portion of each car totals only 20%, taking
into account plant investment and labor. Russian firms supply only
the glass, seats and trim for the cars rolling off the lines
currently.</TE>
<TE>   Nenzen said Ford decided to build the factory in 1999, just months
after Russia's 1998 currency collapse and economic crisis. "The Ford
board was convinced that in the long term this very, very large
country with a lot of inhabitants would have a strong automotive
market with a lot of consumers," he said. "I think others will come
after."</TE>
<TE>   About 1.5 million new and used cars are bought in Russia each
year. About 1 million of those are Russian cars, with new models
selling for $5,000 to $8,000. About 95,000 are imported new cars. The
rest are imported used cars, mainly from Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Given the size of the market and their paltry share, global car
makers such as Ford and GM see Russia as one of the last large
untapped markets for their products.</TE>
<TE>   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union a decade ago, Western
energy companies have committed billions of dollars to help develop
Russia's vast oil-and-gas resources, and there also have been some
investments in food processing products sold to Russian consumers.</TE>
<TE>   But few have moved into industrial manufacturing, which is still
dominated by post-Communist enterprises, many of which have laid off
workers and are still struggling to adjust to free-market conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Sergei L. Loiko of The Times' Moscow Bureau contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Seeks 29 Who Gained Visas in Scheme</HD>
<DH>Fraud: Officials say two men who roomed with Sept. 11
hijacking suspects are among 71 people who received documents in
Qatar.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The United States has launched a nationwide manhunt for 29 people
from the Middle East who were issued fraudulent visas as part of an
illegal scheme run out of the U.S. Embassy in Doha, Qatar, according
to State Department officials.</LD>
<LD>   Two men who roomed with suspected hijackers in the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks are among the 71 people who obtained the illicit
visas, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   As a result of a secret investigation, code-named Operation Eagle
Strike, 31 of the 71 are in custody, State Department officials said.
One of the suspected hijackers' roommates is among those held.</LD>
<TE>   Two of those in custody were arrested during the last week in
Baltimore and near Detroit on suspicion of illegally obtaining visas.
It was unclear Tuesday evening whether any of the others in custody
had been formally charged.</TE>
<TE>   "Thirty-one people have been taken into custody, 29 are actively
being sought, six persons have departed the United States," State
Department spokesman Frederick Jones said. The others were spouses
and minors.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and State Department are trying to determine whether any
of those issued the fraudulent visas are terrorists or whether they
are simply people who wanted to pay their way into the country for
other reasons. So far, U.S. officials say it is premature to make a
connection between the visa scheme and terrorism, although each case
is being investigated for any possible ties to Al Qaeda or other
extremist groups.</TE>
<TE>   "In the post-9/11 world, we look at everything as a potential
danger," said a senior law enforcement official who requested
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Added a State Department official: "In this environment, this is a
train wreck."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI is particularly concerned about Rasmi Subhi Salah al
Shannaq and a man whose name is either Ahmed Ahmad or Ahmed Ahmed.
They lived near Washington, in northern Virginia, with two of the
Sept. 11 hijacking suspects, according to the law enforcement
official.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are trying to determine whether a third man who
obtained an illegal visa was also a roommate of alleged hijackers
Hani Hanjour, one of the suspected plot leaders, and Nawaf Alhazmi.
Both were on American Airlines Flight 77, which crashed into the
Pentagon on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Hanjour is believed to have been the pilot.</TE>
<TE>   Al Shannaq, a 27-year-old Jordanian, was arrested in Baltimore on
June 24 and indicted by a grand jury last week, charged with
unlawfully obtaining a nonimmigrant U.S. visa, an offense that
carries a penalty of up to 10 years in jail and up to $250,000 in
fines, according to court papers.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, U.S. Magistrate Susan Gauvey ordered Al Shannaq held
without bail.</TE>
<TE>   Al Shannaq may be most valuable for what he knows about those
involved with the Sept. 11 attacks. U.S. officials hope that he can
provide information on the hijackers' contacts in the U.S. and
abroad, their financial sources and their means of communication. Al
Shannaq is reportedly cooperating with U.S. authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Al Shannaq allegedly obtained his fraudulent visa on Oct. 1, 2000,
and entered the country at the end of that month.</TE>
<TE>   Al Shannaq and his fiancee have lived in recent months at his
father's home in Baltimore, according to media reports in that city.
He recently worked at a pizza restaurant, although he reportedly was
fired for being unreliable.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed or Ahmad has not been charged but is under investigation,
the law enforcement official said.</TE>
<TE>   The other person known to have been arrested is Majed Ghazi Yousef
Sarhan, a 34-year-old Jordanian who was detained last week in Troy,
Mich., on charges of illegally obtaining a visa in Qatar.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other recipients of fraudulent visas are several
Jordanians and Saudis, according to the Justice Department. Fifteen
of the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11 were from Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation began in January following a tip from an
informant last November that an employee of the U.S. Embassy in Qatar
was granting fraudulent visas for payment of $10,000, according to an
affidavit from Edward Seitz, a special agent with the State
Department's Diplomatic Security Service. The probe was so secret
that not even senior members of the State Department were aware of
it.</TE>
<TE>   Both local and American employees at the embassy in Qatar, a
petroleum-rich sheikdom on the Persian Gulf, are under investigation.
But the primary focus is on a Virginia man who is believed to have
sold the visas for between $10,000 and $20,000 in cash while working
in the embassy, according to a federal law enforcement official who
also asked to remain anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   He is currently under 24-hour surveillance, according to law
enforcement officials.</TE>
<TE>   Described as a State Department employee, he is one of only a
handful of workers who processed visa applications in Qatar over the
past several years. He is a U.S. citizen who had returned from Qatar
to the Washington area for training when he was confronted by agents
from the Diplomatic Security Service.</TE>
<TE>   The employee reportedly refused to talk and has hired a lawyer.
Authorities are reviewing his financial transactions for evidence of
ill-gotten gains.</TE>
<TE>   "They are tracking down the money trail too," said the federal law
enforcement official.</TE>
<TE>   The official said "a bunch" of the visa purchasers were Saudis.
But, he added, "there are all sorts of people" who bought them.</TE>
<TE>   "People probably found out about this guy and that if you have 10
grand, he'll help you," the official said. "So it appears they came
from all over the place."</TE>
<TE>   A former consular affairs official at the State Department
speculated that Al Shannaq may have sought a visa illegally because
his father lives in the U.S. and it is difficult for offspring older
than 21 to obtain visas to join their parents. The huge backlog can
mean a wait of five years or longer, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Al Shannaq would probably also be ineligible for a tourist visa,
because U.S. authorities would be concerned that he would try to stay
illegally.</TE>
<TE>   "Having a relative already in the United States can be both a boon
and a bane," the ex-official said.</TE>

<DH>Analysis: Critics say the president's plan fails to address
core issues. His proposals are labeled nonspecific, irrelevant and
redundant.</DH>

<LD>President Bush's corporate reform initiatives will do little to
restore confidence in America's battered business culture, whether by
shoring up investor trust or discouraging genuinely fraudulent
behavior in the executive suite, according to business experts and
government regulators.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the reforms Bush proposed Tuesday in a Wall Street speech
are irrelevant to today's corporate crime wave, professionals said,
and others already are in place. Some even appear to be less exacting
than existing regulations.</LD>
<LD>   While Bush deplored several developments undermining public
confidence in the securities markets, he proposed only a few specific
solutions. As a result, rather than seizing the high ground in the
burgeoning furor over corporate misbehavior, the president may have
given ammunition to critics who question his commitment to correcting
abuses.</LD>
<TE>   "There was not only nothing on the bones, there was nothing at
all," said Democratic New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer, who has
waged a highly public battle against securities analysts for their
alleged conflicts of interest. Spitzer's recent $100-million
settlement with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. over charges that its analysts
issued tainted opinions has led that firm and others to revise their
standards for analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Bush referred to the controversy over analysts by pledging to
"aggressively enforce" existing Securities and Exchange Commission
rules barring conflicts of interest. But he offered no new proposals
to address the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Bush's proposals addressed issues that aren't noticeably
relevant to the current run of corporate malfeasance. He proposed
legislation barring executives convicted of "abusing their powers"
from ever serving as corporate officers or directors, for example.
The SEC, however, already has the legal power to permanently bar any
individual from serving with public companies. None of the leaders of
the recent parade of companies accused of misleading
investors--including Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc., Global Crossing
Ltd., Xerox Corp. and Adelphia Communications Corp.--has a criminal
record.</TE>
<TE>   On the whole critics faulted Bush for failing to address a core
problem in corporate accounting, which has led to many of the recent
abuses: executives who continue to face powerful
incentives--enhancing their compensation--to dress up their
companies' quarterly financial results.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I was concerned, it really was as anemic as it could
possibly be," said Lawrence E. Mitchell, a law professor at George
Washington University and author of the 2001 book "Corporate
Irresponsibility." "Because those reforms ... don't address the root
problems that even [Bush] seems to recognize, the reforms are
meaningless."</TE>
<TE>   In the speech, given before the Assn. for a Better New York, Bush
argued for higher ethical standards for America's business leaders
and voiced strong support for shareholder rights, including
representation by truly independent boards of directors. But he
failed to generate enthusiasm among investors Tuesday--the Dow Jones
industrial average dropped 178.81 points, although several corporate
earnings reports also appeared to depress stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Bush did criticize what he called excessive and unrealistic
executive pay. He proposed that every chief executive disclose the
details of his or her pay package in annual reports and "explain why
his or her compensation package is in the best interest of the
company he serves."</TE>
<TE>   But current rules require disclosure of the pay packages of the
top five corporate officers--not only the CEO--in a public company's
annual proxy statement, which is filed publicly and mailed to every
shareholder.</TE>
<TE>   And compensation experts said the most important cause of the
explosion in executive pay in recent years is the expanding use of
stock options, which Bush did not specifically address. The value of
options tended to rise exponentially during the bull market of the
1990s, when their prevalence in pay plans encouraged executives to
manage with an eye toward boosting short-term share prices rather
than enhancing the long-term or intrinsic values of their companies.</TE>
<TE>   "The massive increase in executive stock options creates enormous
temptation for fraud," said Jennifer Arlen, a New York University law
professor specializing in securities fraud and corporate governance.
"Bush made no mention of this even though everyone familiar with
corporate governance knows this is a huge issue."</TE>
<TE>   Bush failed to mention a reform widely supported by shareholder
activists (and vigorously opposed by corporate executives) that would
require companies to account for the cost of executive options on
their income statements, thus exacting a real price for excessive
option awards.</TE>
<TE>   "Charging earnings for the cost of stock options is the hydrogen
bomb in terms of lowering executive pay," said Graef Crystal, a
leading executive compensation expert. Crystal said that under
current accounting rules, a company can issue any quantity of options
to executives without reflecting the cost on its books until the
options are exercised, generally years in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Securities fraud experts also picked apart Bush's proposal to
double the maximum prison term for mail or wire fraud to 10 years.
The top penalty for securities fraud, the main charge normally
brought in accounting-related cases, already is 10 years, experts
said. Mail and wire fraud often are ancillary charges brought
alongside securities fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The shorter maximum sentences rarely pose an obstacle to
determined prosecutors; those seeking longer sentences for mail or
wire fraud simply charge defendants with multiple counts.</TE>
<TE>   Current and former regulators said that longer prison sentences
won't deter any wrongdoing until CEOs believe that their actions will
be detected and aggressively prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   Other criminal experts said white-collar defendants customarily
have evaded even the minimum five-year sentence. Savings and loan
executives convicted of fraud in the early 1990s were sentenced to an
average of just more than three years in federal prisons, said Henry
Pontell, a criminologist at UC Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, convicted burglars were sentenced to an average
55.6 months during the same period and first-time drug offenders got
64.9 months.</TE>
<TE>   "There are too many ways for [white-collar criminals] to escape
the ultimate sanction," Pontell said. "As long as they know they have
a greater likelihood of escaping detection, hiding behind layers of
corporate responsibility, and that they will have a fleet of
high-priced lawyers at their side, increasing sanctions could have
little effect on their behavior."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the executives who presided over the most spectacular
corporate debacles of recent months maintain that they worked within
the law.</TE>
<TE>   "To this day Kenneth Lay [former Enron CEO] doesn't believe he did
anything wrong," said Michael J. Connell, a former associate director
of the SEC's division of corporate finance. "That's very much the
prevailing attitude" in corporate boardrooms, said Connell, who is in
private practice in Los Angeles with Morrison &amp; Foerster.</TE>
<TE>   Some corporate experts said the only way to stem the outbreak of
executive abuse may be to revise the corporate regulatory system as
decisively as was done after the market crash of 1929, when the SEC
was established.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is easily summed up," Connell said. "The system of
financial reporting was put in place before the PC became widely
accessible, and it's out of date. There's too long a time lag between
when management knows what's going on and when they have to tell
other people. The incentive is for them to manipulate the numbers,
because their compensation and prestige depend on it. The system
doesn't require information to flow into the marketplace in a timely
fashion."</TE>
<TE>   Public corporations are required to report their unaudited
revenues and profits every quarter and to issue fully audited
accounts once a year.</TE>
<TE>   But the largest companies, such as the Fortune 500, Connell said,
theoretically are able to issue some material figures as often as
once a day--a rate more commensurate with the flow of trading
information in today's computer-dependent markets.</TE>
<TE>   Connell acknowledged that no one in Washington has proposed such a
radical reconsideration of reporting standards.</TE>
<TE>   "But we need a whole new set of standards designed to get
financial information into the marketplace quicker," he said.</TE>

shredding and other forms of obstruction of justice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Strengthen the SEC: Bolster the Securities and Exchange
Commission's ability to freeze improper payments to corporate
executives while a company is being investigated. Urge Congress to

<LD>Elan Corp.'s top two executives lost their jobs at the Irish drug
maker, whose shares have tumbled more than 90% since an accounting
probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission began in February.</LD>
<LD>   Former Chairman and Chief Executive Donal Geaney, 51, and Vice
Chairman Thomas Lynch, 45, agreed to step down. The board determined
a change was necessary, new Chairman Garo Armen said.</LD>
<LD>   Elan was worth about $23 billion in June 2001, before the U.S.
accounting investigation, cheaper competition for its best-selling
medicine and the failure of an Alzheimer's treatment whittled that
down to less than $1 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Elan fell 40 cents, or 18%, to $1.80 on the New York

<HD>2 Inglewood Officials End Vacations</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Inglewood's top city administrator and police chief are cutting short
vacations to return to their jobs after the videotaped beating of a
16-year-old boy by an Inglewood police officer, the city's mayor said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Roosevelt F. Dorn said Police Chief Ronald C. Banks will
break off his vacation in Hawaii. City Administrator Joseph T. Rouzan
Jr. is returning from out of the area, Dorn said.</LD>
<LD>   Banks' absence has been particularly notable in recent days, as
his department has been deluged with reaction to the incident
involving Donovan Jackson. On Wednesday, Inglewood officers helped
control a protest that stormed inside City Hall.</LD>
<TE>   Banks joined the Inglewood Police Department in March 1998, after
a 32-year career with the Los Angeles Police Department, where he
rose to become assistant chief under Chief Willie L. Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Banks became one of Williams' closest advisors. But in 1997, as
Williams was leaving the LAPD, interim Los Angeles Police Chief Bayan
Lewis ruled that Banks inappropriately sought a pay raise he did not
deserve.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly thereafter, Banks retired from the LAPD and took charge of
Inglewood's department.</TE>

<HD>Experts Approach With Caution</HD>
<DH>Police: Many say context is important in judging whether
excessive force was used in incident.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trying to resolve whether officers' actions were justified--the
question now before investigators in the case of a controversial
police incident in Inglewood on Saturday--is one of the murkier areas
of police discipline.</LD>
<LD>   There are guidelines, but there is no precise blueprint for how
police should use force. What's required varies with the situation.</LD>
<LD>   Generally, police are authorized to use force, even deadly force,
in defense of themselves or others. Judging whether excessive force
was used is the key to cases of alleged brutality.</LD>
<TE>   A number of experts were cautious in trying to assess the Saturday
episode, which was partly videotaped by a witness. Mindful of past
cases like the Rodney King beating, in which key elements of the
event were not caught on tape, they were quick to point out that not
all the facts about the Inglewood case are known.</TE>
<TE>   "When you see a portion of an incident, it is important to know
total context of incident from beginning to end," said Bob Stresak, a
senior consultant with the California Commission on Peace Officers
Standards and Training. "What initiated the stop? What knowledge were
the officers armed with? What type of area was it--a high crime area?
Was this initiated by suspect description related to a serious
felony? All those components need to be taken into account" when
evaluating use of force, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Pasco, executive director of the National Fraternal Order of
Police, said there should be no rush to judgment because "a lot of
things happened before that videotape started rolling."</TE>
<TE>   But many police officers were uneasy with what they, and millions
of television viewers, saw on the videotape: images of police
slamming a limp, handcuffed teen-ager onto a car and then punching
him in the face.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, striking someone who has already been handcuffed,
in most cases, violates "a cardinal rule" of use of force, said Greg
Berg, a retired LAPD commander who is now director of community and
safety services for Cerritos. "When someone is handcuffed, everything
is finished at that point."</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood police officials say 16-year-old Donovan Jackson, whom
his lawyer describes as developmentally disabled, became violent
before the videotape begins.</TE>
<TE>   But Saturday's incident, and the unusual videotaping, was enough
to nudge some police officials out of their usual reticence to pass
judgment on fellow officers.</TE>
<TE>   "You only apply force when there is something the force is going
to accomplish," said LAPD Deputy Chief David C. Doan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clearly a policy of ours: Just like we don't shoot moving
cars, we don't hit handcuffed suspects," said Cmdr. Jim McMurray,
head of LAPD internal affairs. "You use whatever force is appropriate
to get [a suspect] to stop resisting.... Then once a person stops
resisting, you stop using force."</TE>
<TE>   There are exceptions, officers said. If a suspect is still violent
while in handcuffs, officers are justified in continuing to use
force. A number of police officials told of suspects who spit, bite
or kick while handcuffed, sometimes violently enough to smash the
windows of patrol cars.</TE>
<TE>   But officers have tools to control a suspect without throwing
punches, they said. Even if an officer had been hit by the suspect,
said D.P. Van Blaricom, a use-of-force expert and former chief of the
Bellevue, Wash., Police Department, he or she has no right to strike
back when the suspect is handcuffed and not resisting.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been hit, bit and spit on," he said. "That's part of the
job. Once you have the person in custody, you don't get to inflict
summary punishment on them."</TE>
<TE>   The videotape repeatedly played on local television news stations
quickly became the talk of law enforcement--especially in the LAPD,
which has a history of high-profile use-of-force incidents dating
back decades. Examples of suspects being beaten or harmed while
handcuffed or restrained are immortalized in the Christopher
Commission report, an exhaustive examination of the King beating in
1991.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD training commander George Gascon said the videotape even hit
a sour note with a group of new LAPD recruits who had seen the
videotape, and discussed it among themselves. "They were disturbed,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few years after being subjected to thorough scrutiny in the
wake of the King beating, the LAPD was rattled by a second,
high-profile scandal involving brutality when revelations of
corruption in the agency's Rampart Division surfaced. The department
has undergone elaborate and expensive changes since then, adding new
audit departments, raking in complaints and attempting to crack down
on officers who conceal wrongdoing. But a fail-safe formula to
prevent officer misconduct has yet to be found.</TE>
<TE>   Training is not enough to prevent misconduct, LAPD Capt. Sergio
Diaz said. "It takes action on a lot of different fronts. You have to
set the tone, in all your communications with subordinates.... You
take complaints very seriously, you let officers know they are not
allowed to cover up serious misconduct."</TE>

<HD>Deputy's Report Offers Account of Beating</HD>
<DH>Inglewood: Protesters at City Hall decry brutality. Mayor
says the teen's civil rights were violated.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The official account of the videotaped beating of a 16-year-old
Inglewood boy describes an increasingly tense situation in which
officers repeatedly gave orders to the boy, only to be met by what
they perceived as resistance.</LD>
<LD>   "I asked him to place his hands on the roof," wrote Sheriff's
Deputy Carlos Lopez in his report, a copy of which was shared with
The Times on Tuesday. "He didn't respond and continued to stare at
me."</LD>
<LD>   But a family member said Donovan Jackson suffers from a speech
impediment and a hearing disability that prevents him from responding
promptly.</LD>
<TE>   "You tell him something, and he doesn't get it right then," said
his cousin Talibah Shakir, a sixth-grade teacher in Los Angeles.
"He's slow to react."</TE>
<TE>   Anger over the images of a white police officer striking Jackson,
who is black, reached a boiling point in Inglewood, a city of 113,000
people. Protesters surged into the mayor's office Tuesday and
demanded a meeting. Shadowed by Inglewood police--whose chief, Ronald
Banks, was on vacation--the activists chanted: "Handcuff them!
Handcuff them!"</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Roosevelt Dorn confronted the 100 or so protesters who made
their way to his office and echoed their denunciation of the beating.
Dorn described the incident, in which at least one officer struck the
handcuffed boy, as a "felony assault" and called for the officer to
be fired and prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't think of anything this teenager could have done that
would justify the conduct that I observed on the video," said Dorn,
who served 18 years as a judge. "This young man's civil rights
without question were violated."</TE>
<TE>   Dorn said it appeared to him that, in addition to felony assault,
the officer was guilty of assault with a deadly weapon, battery and
child abuse. The officer, Jeremy J. Morse, was relieved of duty
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The incident occurred Saturday, after two Los Angeles County
sheriff's deputies approached Jackson's father, Coby Chavis Jr., at
an Inglewood gas station.</TE>
<TE>   The deputies were investigating Chavis' expired license
tags--Chavis says he was singled out because he is black, a charge
the Sheriff's Department denies.</TE>
<TE>   As they questioned Chavis, Jackson emerged from the gas station
store with potato chips, and a scuffle broke out, partially captured
on videotape by a bystander.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson was arrested on suspicion of resisting arrest and
interfering with a police officer. He was treated for his injuries
and released.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood police and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department
have opened investigations into the incident. The FBI and Los Angeles
County district attorney's office have also begun separate
investigations.</TE>
<TE>   But the flurry of law enforcement response did not placate those
angered by the televised images of Morse slamming Jackson into a
police cruiser and then striking him. Since the incident was first
televised, Inglewood police have been deluged by calls, and
protesters insisted Tuesday that no provocation could have justified
the police actions against Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Dorn agreed. "If this teenager had spit in their face, called them
all kinds of names, kicked them, attacked, once he was subdued, once
he was handcuffed, he was picked up, he should have been taken to the
car, not slammed face-down on the hood of a car."</TE>
<TE>   Some protesters remained skeptical that significant action would
be taken.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened to the dudes who beat Rodney King? Not much," said
Corey Stevens, 30.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff's version of the incident, the official account of the
arrest, was disclosed for the first time Tuesday. Written before the
videotape became public, it portrays a series of events in which
authorities, not knowing that Jackson suffered from a disability,
appear to have grown agitated by his refusal to heed their
instructions.</TE>
<TE>   According to a report written Saturday night by Lopez, the
sheriff's deputy, Jackson attempted to get back to his father's car
when he returned from the gas station store. Lopez asked him not to
get into the car, and the boy turned and looked at the deputy "with
an angered expression on his face....He was breathing hard."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez told him to wait while the deputies investigated the vehicle
violations, but the boy kept "intently staring" at the deputy. He put
his hand in his left pocket, the report said, and appeared "to
manipulate something" in his pocket.</TE>
<TE>   The deputy then asked him whether he had anything in his pocket,
but the boy ignored him, the report said. He asked a second time, and
Jackson ignored him.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez decided to pat him down for weapons, and the boy's body
became rigid, the report said. He asked Jackson to sit in the patrol
car. "I opened the right rear door and ordered him to sit down, he
tensed his body and did not comply," Lopez wrote.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, the Inglewood police officers pulled up into the
gas station parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez wrote that he repeatedly ordered Jackson to get into the
car, and it appeared Jackson was going to comply. But he didn't, and
instead moved toward the deputy, Lopez wrote. "He lunged at me,
raising his hands in front of him," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez then "took him to the ground" and struggled to place
handcuffs on the boy's wrists. Jackson refused numerous commands to
lie face-down on the ground and kept his body sideways, the report
said.</TE>
<TE>   "During the altercation, the suspect pulled, scratched and fought
with the deputies and the officers," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's behavior at the scene, according to his family, is
explainable by his condition. They say that Jackson never resisted
officers and that the police attacked the boy. According to his
cousin Shakir and the family lawyer, Joe Hopkins, Jackson's
disability makes it especially difficult for him to process more than
one command at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Shakir said the family plans to file a lawsuit against the
Inglewood Police Department today.</TE>
<TE>   In his report, Lopez does not say whether he or other officers
questioned Jackson's ability to understand them. He also never
mentions that Morse struck the boy.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials say the deputies will be interviewed today by
department investigators.</TE>
<TE>   They say a number of questions remain. Among them: Did the
deputies see the altercation between the boy and the Inglewood
officers? If so, what obligation did they have to report it?</TE>
<TE>   Despite the omission of details about Morse's involvement,
Undersheriff Bill Stonich said he did not see anything in the
videotape that would lead him to believe the deputies did anything
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "I have not seen ... any evidence of wrongdoing on the part of our
deputies," Stonich said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Faced with the condemnation of Inglewood's mayor and angry
community reactions to the incident, some of Morse's colleagues
defended the officer, who remained out of public view. The videotape
excerpt of a single arrest, they said, should not be allowed to
define Morse's three-year career.</TE>
<TE>   Det. Neil Murray, president of the Inglewood Police Officers
Assn., described Morse as a solid and dedicated cop, firmly committed
to his job and the community. Morse began his police career with the
Inglewood department, where he is respected by other officers, and
has done a good job, Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   "His reputation is a solid one. Those who have worked with Jeremy
have always been impressed with his level of professional police
work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Department officials refused to disclose any history of
commendations or disciplinary actions, saying they were confidential.</TE>
<TE>   And many police officers refused to speak about Morse's background
or personal life, citing the numerous investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Morse was a patrol cop, usually teamed with a partner while
working in different areas of the city. On Saturday night, Morse was
one of four Inglewood police officers at the scene. Morse and Bijan
Darvish are white, Mariano Salcedo a Latino officer and Antoine Crook
an African American.</TE>
<TE>   In a 2000 case, Morse was among officers accused of assaulting a
suspect. The case was dismissed, however, when the plaintiff failed
to appear in court.</TE>
<TE>   J. Mitchell Steinbrecher, owner of Citicopters News Service, a
freelance news video agency, said he filed a complaint against Morse
and two other Inglewood officers after a run-in on April 26, 2001, in
which Morse allegedly cursed and threatened him.</TE>
<TE>   And last month, 32-year-old Neilson Williams accused Morse and
others of handcuffing him and beating him with batons near Ashwood
Park.</TE>
<TE>   "The police pulled up, and they just went wild," he said. "They
rolled up on me like I had robbed a bank or something."</TE>
<TE>   Williams said he spent five days in the hospital, including three
in the intensive care unit. Williams has filed a complaint with the
Inglewood Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood Police Lt. Alex Perez confirmed the department had
received a formal complaint from Williams, but declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jackson and his father returned home Tuesday evening,
acknowledging reporters as they entered the house. They declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson has begun to feel unsafe in his Inglewood home, Shakir
said. According to her, Jackson believes that police will return and
try to punish him because the videotape has caused so much trouble.
"This is a really good kid--no drugs, doesn't cuss," said Shakir. "He
doesn't understand why this was done to him."</TE>

Leovy, Richard Marosi and Richard Winton contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Tonga Is Not Amused</HD>
<DH>The island kingdom appointed a California investment
advisor as court jester. But nobody is laughing over the loss of a
multimillion-dollar trust fund.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some might say that as official court jester to the island kingdom of
Tonga, Jesse Bogdonoff isn't very funny.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of cracking them up in the South Pacific nation, the
Sonoma County resident has performed just one notable trick so far:
He made $24 million belonging to the Tongans disappear, according to
a lawsuit filed by the kingdom last month in San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   The loss has thrown the impoverished kingdom into uproar.
Bogdonoff, who also was Tonga's financial advisor, has been fired.
Government ministers have resigned. And in a nation ruled by a king
and 33 noble families, commoners in Parliament are using the scandal
as evidence that the time has come for more inclusive government.</LD>
<TE>   But Bogdonoff, 47, is still very merry. Though his financial
career is in ruins, he is confident that the debacle ultimately
offers lessons both for him and the Tongan people.</TE>
<TE>   The events that led Bogdonoff to become first jester, then
financial advisor and then persona non grata in a nation he had
barely heard of a decade ago began in Bank of America's San Francisco
office.</TE>
<TE>   Bogdonoff was an investment advisor, working on commission and
charged with persuading bank customers to make better use of their
money by investing in securities.</TE>
<TE>   One day in 1994, he stumbled upon the Tonga Trust Fund. It was no
ordinary checking account: more than $20 million was just sitting
there.</TE>
<TE>   The money had been earned in an unusual fashion too.</TE>
<TE>   Tonga's economy is based mostly on exports of baby squash and cash
sent back by Tongans living abroad. But for a while in the mid-1980s,
the Tongan government had begun selling passports, mostly to Hong
Kong residents who feared their travel would be restricted when the
former colony was handed back to China. In 1988, the money was
deposited in the Bank of America. Bogdonoff said his colleagues at
the bank told him not to worry about the account, that the Tongan
people were out in the middle of the Pacific and best left alone.</TE>
<TE>   "But being the sales professional that I am," Bogdonoff said, he
began making long-distance phone calls. He quickly learned that they
did business a little differently in Tonga.</TE>
<TE>   The ministers he needed to speak with were always out of the
country or unavailable, he said. So he decided to pay a personal
visit.</TE>
<TE>   In November 1994, he boarded a plane in San Francisco, and nearly
24 hours later found himself standing alone by a dusty landing strip
outside the capital city of Nuku'alofa.</TE>
<TE>   He was stunned by the signs of poverty: the dirt roads, the
absence of streetlights, pigs roaming free.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thinking, $21 million in a checking account," he said. "You'd
think they might put a few more lights out here."</TE>
<TE>   But the bright blue ocean and skies and the palm trees swaying in
the warm, tropical wind captivated him, as did the friendly, relaxed
people. On his third day in the islands, Bogdonoff met King
Taufa'ahau Tupou IV. The introduction was arranged by a businessman
both men knew. The king's ancestors had unified the Polynesian tribes
living on 171 islands and helped them resist the European colonialism
that swept the South Pacific. Ever since, the royal family has made
most of the decisions in Tonga, as Bogdonoff soon learned.</TE>
<TE>   Bogdonoff was shown through the back door of the royal residence,
a Victorian house near the sea. The king greeted him in a muumuu in
his book-lined office, outfitted with a weightlifting machine, a
treadmill and a big-screen television, Bogdonoff said.</TE>
<TE>   They hit it off immediately, Bogdonoff said. The king and the
investment advisor launched into a passionate two-hour conversation
on subjects ranging from literature to the O.J. Simpson murder trial.
O.J. didn't do it, the king told Bogdonoff.</TE>
<TE>   He also met with government ministers in charge of the trust
account. He says he explained the concept of stocks and bonds and
promised them a much higher rate of return than they were getting
from the checking account. Soon,  Bogdonoff said, he was sitting in a
government office, furiously stamping bank papers with the royal
Tongan seal and preparing to fax them across the ocean to close the
deal.</TE>
<TE>   Stamping the papers with the seal was his idea, Bogdonoff said,
"to make this thing real."</TE>
<TE>   From then on, he claims, he carefully managed the Tongan account,
and its fortunes rose with the bullish market of the late 1990s,
making $11.8 million over five years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Bogdonoff decided to leave Bank of America. He said the
reason was personal: He feared for his health because of an
increasing workload and was disillusioned with changes at the
company. Bank of America officials would not comment.</TE>
<TE>   There was just one problem: Bogdonoff faced a lawsuit from the
bank if he took the Tongan account with him--unless he somehow became
an employee of the kingdom.</TE>
<TE>   He flew to Tonga and explained the situation to fund managers.</TE>
<TE>   It was during those talks that Bogdonoff, who happened to have
been born on April 1, had an idea. He told the king: "I'm a
natural-born fool, and you're a king, and I'd like to become your
jester."</TE>
<TE>   The king at first was cool to the request, Bogdonoff said,
protesting that he had no use for a jester. But Bogdonoff persisted,
promising that he would make it part of his duties to be a Tonga
booster, encouraging tourists to visit the islands.</TE>
<TE>   In April 1999, according to a royal decree Bogdonoff asked the
king to draw up, he became "King of Jesters and Jester to the King to
fulfill his royal duty sharing mirthful wisdom and joy as a special
goodwill ambassador to the world."</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, the Tonga Trust Fund appointed Bogdonoff as its
advisor at an annual salary of $250,000, allowing him to leave Bank
of America with the account.</TE>
<TE>   According to the lawsuit, Bogdonoff promised to charge Tonga lower
management fees than those proposed by Merrill Lynch or Wells Fargo,
two companies competing for the account.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, the fund was worth $26.5 million, according to the
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Bogdonoff then recommended that Tonga invest $20 million in a
company that purchased life insurance polices from senior citizens.
He also arranged for the trust to invest $6.5 million in other
companies.</TE>
<TE>   The kingdom lost almost all of it.</TE>
<TE>   The life insurance company, Millennium Asset Management, was to
pay Tongan officials $26 million by June 2001, a return of $6
million. According to the lawsuit, the company has not paid. The
company could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   A second investment was in a company whose stock, according to the
suit, is now worthless. Another investment involved a high-tech
start-up that has since filed for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit also alleges that Millennium and another company paid
Bogdonoff secret commissions for the Tongan investments. Bogdonoff
does not deny receiving commissions, but claims Tongan officials knew
about them.</TE>
<TE>   As for the fact that all his recommendations failed, he said: "I
was trying to help.... I thought I was thinking innovatively."</TE>
<TE>   But he also accuses the royal family, specifically the king's
children, of making it impossible for him to recover the money once
the investments began to go sour.</TE>
<TE>   Bogdonoff said he went to Tonga twice last year with a plan to
salvage the investments, the second time bringing a media advisor to
help manage press inquiries about the lost money.</TE>
<TE>   But he was greeted with rage, bureaucratic paralysis and a "go
shoot the jester" mentality, he said. Eventually, he said, the
government posted a condemnation against him and Millennium on the
Internet. The effect of that, he said, was to scare away any buyers
who could have rescued the investment.</TE>
<TE>   He called the lawsuit against him frivolous and an "expression of
incredible incompetence and political intrigue of the children of the
royal family. It's typically Tongan."</TE>
<TE>   Tongan government officials said in a statement that the Tongan
attorney general will go to San Francisco to consult on the court
case against Bogdonoff.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone in Tonga is upset about what happened," said Sangster
Saulala, editor  of the Tonga Star newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of democracy in Tonga contend that a more open system of
government could have prevented the fiasco.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Sevele, a prominent businessman and economist and member of
Parliament, said the king was taken in by Bogdonoff because he didn't
seek the advice of anyone outside his small circle of advisors.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the ministers haven't got a clue about running a public
organization for the people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mateni Tapueleulu, editor of the newspaper Tonga Times, said he
was upset to read Internet accounts in which Bogdonoff did not seem
to realize the impact of the loss for the Tongan people.</TE>
<TE>   His comments "are too light to account for the serious loss we're
facing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The one silver lining, Tapueleulu said, is that the experience
"has given the democracy movement some credibility."</TE>
<TE>   Bogdonoff said he did take the loss of Tonga's money seriously,
and that he has only recently recovered his cheerful disposition.</TE>
<TE>   "I was and remain deeply saddened by this unnecessary loss," he
said. "It didn't have to happen this way."</TE>
<TE>   He said the saga taught him many lessons, among them that "money
isn't the only thing in the universe." He said he hopes the
experience will teach Tongans to question their leaders more closely.</TE>
<TE>   Bogdonoff said he is trying to move on. In fact, with the support
of his wife and children, he said he has decided to pursue a new
career in music. He has his own sound, which he describes as "a
funky, jazzy fusion." He is considering calling his music company the
Jester's Heart.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm gonna keep the identity," he said. "There's a certain amount
of notoriety" that may help sales. And after all, he points out, the
royal decree said his term as jester "was forevermore."</TE>
<TE>   "The decree was that I would be a goodwill ambassador to tell the
world how wonderful Tonga is," he said. "Unfortunately, right now
it's not being reciprocated."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Richard C. Paddock contributed to this report.</TE>

<KH>ROD STEIGER: 1925 - 2002</KH>
<HD>Method Actor Infused His Roles With Raw Intensity</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rod Steiger, an Oscar-winning actor whose chameleon-like ability to
inhabit diverse characters placed him firmly among a generation of
acclaimed postwar performers, died Tuesday at age 77.</LD>
<LD>   Steiger, who gave particularly memorable performances in "The
Pawnbroker" and "In the Heat of the Night," died of pneumonia and
kidney failure at a Los Angeles hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Steiger was the consummate Method actor, who studied under Lee
Strasberg at the Actors Studio in New York and was known for bringing
a raw intensity to his performances. He playeda middle-aged Italian
butcher in the television drama "Marty" and a bigoted Southern
sheriff of "In the Heat of the Night," a role that earned him the
Academy Award.</LD>
<TE>   Not a typically handsome man, he used his beefy frame and doughy
face to create memorable characters, first as a supporting actor and
then in starring roles.</TE>
<TE>   The actors of his generation, including Marlon Brando, James Dean,
Montgomery Clift and Paul Newman, rejected traditional acting styles
for more intimate interpretations. Their characters often reflected
the deep-rooted anxieties facing American society in the Cold War
era. These actors drew on their own torments and neuroses to expose
the soul of their characters.</TE>
<TE>   "The lions are leaving the circus," said director Norman Jewison,
who worked with Steiger on three films, including "In the Heat of the
Night." "Boy, Rod was a lion if there ever was [one]."</TE>
<TE>   Born in the Long Island town of Westhampton, N.Y., on April 14,
1925, Steiger knew at an early age that he wanted to become an actor.
His parents, Lorraine and Frederick, were part of a song-and-dance
team and divorced when Steiger was only 1 year old.</TE>
<TE>   Steiger, whose full name was Rodney Stephen Steiger, began acting
in grade school. He was known among his schoolmates as Rodney the
Rock because of his stocky build and his strong personality. He once
told The Times that his difficult childhood gave him a drive to
succeed.</TE>
<TE>   "People used to laugh at my family because of alcoholic problems,"
he said in 1991. "I used to pull my mother out of saloons, and I
heard the neighbors titter. I must have sworn to myself someday that
I would do something good enough that they would respect the name of
Steiger. I think that is what gave me a certain intensity. I made
acting too much my life."</TE>
<TE>   After only one year of high school, he lied about his age and at
16 enlisted in the Navy. He served as a torpedoman in the South
Pacific during World War II and took part in some of its greatest
battles, including the Iwo Jima and Okinawa campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   When he returned home, Steiger took advantage of the GI Bill to
study acting at the New School for Social Research in New York.</TE>
<TE>   He studied at the Actors Studio from 1946-47, immersing himself in
the teachings of Method guru Strasberg, whose other students included
Brando and Marilyn Monroe. At the time, Strasberg's method was
considered nearly revolutionary, requiring actors to tap into their
personal experiences to become the character they were playing.</TE>
<TE>   Between 1948 and 1953 Steiger appeared in more than 250 live
television productions, the best known being the 1953 Paddy Chayefsky
drama "Marty."</TE>
<TE>   By 1951 the actor had made his debut on Broadway and appeared in
his first film role, in director Fred Zinnemann's "Teresa." Three
years later, Steiger received his first Oscar nomination for playing
Brando's thuggish brother Charlie in Elia Kazan's seminal drama "On
the Waterfront."</TE>
<TE>   Brando and Steiger were not chummy on the set. In fact there was,
according to Steiger, "a little animosity between us." But director
Kazan milked that tension for all it was worth. Steiger recalled in a
1994 interview with The Times that "Kazan couldn't wait to see us do
a scene together and kill each other to be the better one. I guess
the proof of the pudding came out in the taxi scene. I don't know who
was better or worse--but we both worked together pretty well, I
think."</TE>
<TE>   They worked so well together that Jewison called Steiger "the only
guy I have ever seen who acted Brando off the screen, in that scene.
As Brando got bigger, Rod got smaller," he said of Steiger's subtle
performance.</TE>
<TE>   With the success of that film--which won seven Oscars, including
best picture--Steiger's film career skyrocketed. He tried his hand at
a variety of roles, including playing the surly ranch hand, Jud, in
the 1955 film of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Oklahoma!" directed by
Zinnemann.</TE>
<TE>   In 1965 Steiger starred in David Lean's epic romance "Dr.
Zhivago." But it was his performance the same year in Sidney Lumet's
provocative drama "The Pawnbroker" that many critics consider his
best.</TE>
<TE>   Steiger was lavished with praised for his portrayal of a bitter
Holocaust survivor operating a Harlem pawnshop and was confident of
an Academy Award. "Should I jump up or walk slow? Should I kiss that
beautiful woman over there or say hello to this producer over here?"
he recalled of his fantasizing before the announcement. "I was so
cocky about it that I kind of buttoned my jacket and was halfway out
of my seat when they said, 'Lee Marvin for "Cat Ballou." ' I couldn't
believe my ears."</TE>
<TE>   But two years later, he won for his "In the Heat of the Night"
performance as the bombastic, gum-chewing Sheriff Gillespie.</TE>
<TE>   Steiger was an actor who was keenly focused on the details of a
character--details that he understood would bring out their humanity.</TE>
<TE>   The trick for the Gillespie role was in how he chewed his gum.
Initially, Steiger argued with Jewison that having the sheriff
constantly chewing gum was a cliche. But soon, the actor figured out
how to use the gum to his advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "We were rehearsing, and I noticed that when I got excited, I was
chewing fast," recalled Steiger in an interview. "I thought, 'Wait a
minute. I can let the audience know how I am feeling with this
chewing gum?' Bang! I'm out of the cliche. When this guy chews fast,
you know he is upset. When he slows down, you know he is thinking.
And when he stops chewing, you don't know what the hell he is going
to do."</TE>
<TE>   Although Jewison had confidence in Steiger, he also knew he had to
be firm with him.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone would always say he was always overacting," the director
recalled. "But I said, 'I'd rather have someone overact and give me
some choices than not be there at all.' We would shout at each other.
He would say, 'What's the matter? You got it!' and I would say,
'Let's do one more take, maybe a little easier.' We had great respect
and trust and especially after he won the Academy Award, I was God."</TE>
<TE>   Biggest Mistake</TE>
<TE>   Steiger's biggest mistake, the actor said, was turning down the
title role of "Patton." At the time he was flying high from his Oscar
win and decided that he didn't need the part of the controversial
World War II general. George C. Scott went on to win the Academy
Award for that role.</TE>
<TE>   Though Steiger consistently gave interesting performances after
"In the Heat of the Night," the roles never lived up to his earlier
work.</TE>
<TE>   "What was most admirable about Steiger was that to the end he
lived up to the old credo that there are no small parts, just small
actors," said Los Angeles Times film reviewer Kevin Thomas. "He gave
his best to the largely supporting roles in a number of mainly
otherwise forgettable movies that made up the later years of his film
career."</TE>
<TE>   It was during a career slump in the early 1970s, that Steiger's
demons manifested themselves with a vengeance. Married five times,
including once to actress Claire Bloom, he fought his biggest
personal battle with clinical depression.</TE>
<TE>   He tried to kill himself twice and, according to good friend
Arthur Hiller, who directed him in the 1976 movie "W.C. Fields and
Me," became an alcoholic.</TE>
<TE>   During his bout with depression, Steiger called a friend to
retrieve a shotgun he owned because he feared he would kill himself.
Still, he tried to commit suicide once by taking an overdose of pills
and again by attempting to drown himself in the Pacific Ocean, near
his Malibu home.</TE>
<TE>   The actor said in a 1994 interview with The Times that he had to
lock himself in a room in his home and "for three days I tore the
walls. I tore myself up. I bit myself. People forget we are the
highest form of animal. That animal can take over and destroy."</TE>
<TE>   Open About Depression</TE>
<TE>   Though his agent and manager advised him not to talk about his
depression, Steiger went public in the late 1980s about the illness.
In 1993, he testified before Congress, reading a six-page poem called
"Hitting Rock Bottom." His testimony helped in part to secure nearly
$24 million in federal funding for mental health research.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Frederick Goodwin, former director of the National Institute
of Mental Health, who worked with Steiger on a decade-long public
awareness campaign, said the actor was rare in his commitment and his
knowledge about the illness.</TE>
<TE>   Through therapy and medication, Steiger emerged from his
depression and resuscitated his career. In recent years, he appeared
in such films as "The Hurricane" and the Antonio Banderas-directed
Southern gothic "Crazy in Alabama."</TE>
<TE>   Lee Grant, a fellow "In the Heat of the Night" actor, recalled
when she and Steiger met with a group of students to talk about their
craft.</TE>
<TE>   One student asked what it was like to be a star. Steiger
responded, "You go 16 rounds. You are hurt. You are bloody. And they
finally lift your hand up and you've won. And then the bell rings for
the next round."</TE>
<TE>   "Rod was up there fighting with everything he had. He was a
winner," Grant said.</TE>
<TE>   Steiger is survived by his fifth wife, Joan Benedict Steiger; a
daughter, Anna; and a son, Michael. In lieu of flowers, the family
requests that donations be sent to the Motion Picture and Television
Country House and Hospital, 23388 Mulholland Drive, Woodland Hills,
CA 91364.</TE>

<HD>Bush's Doubts on Regulation Again Surface</HD>
<DH>Scandals: He backs stiffer laws, but his basic theme is
still one of personal ethics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Even in a speech that urged a new government offensive against
corporate fraud, President Bush on Tuesday again revealed his
deep-seated skepticism about the ability of Washington regulation to
solve social problems.</LD>
<LD>   While endorsing "tougher laws and stricter requirements," Bush
insisted that in the end, something else would be more important in
curbing the wave of corporate crime dominating the headlines.
"Ultimately, the ethics of American business depend on the conscience
of America's business leaders," he said.</LD>
<LD>   That emphasis on individual change over collective action is a
consistent element in Bush's thinking. After the shootings at
Columbine High School in 1999 in Colorado, he made almost exactly the
same arguments in asserting that cultural change would do more to
prevent a repeat of such violence than new laws.</LD>
<TE>   As he frames his response to the wave of corporate scandals, Bush
seems buffeted between that fundamental leeriness about new
regulations and the growing political and economic pressure for
measures to restore confidence in the stock market. The result has
been to steadily tug Bush toward more aggressive securities
regulation than he envisioned when he took office--although still not
nearly as sweeping as most Democrats believe is necessary.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Democrats quickly criticized Bush for failing to
specifically endorse the reform measures they are pushing in the
Senate, particularly the proposal to create an independent new
oversight board to regulate the accounting industry.</TE>
<TE>   "What the president did today in using the bully pulpit was good,"
Gary Gensler, an undersecretary of Treasury under former President
Clinton, said Tuesday. "But calling for ... just throwing a few more
laws at the bad apples falls short. At the heart of this, the
president has still not spoken strongly for real reform of the
accounting profession."</TE>
<TE>   This hard line is a change in direction for many congressional
Democrats, who in recent years sided with the financial industries to
resist tougher government oversight. Only last year there was so
little opposition in the Senate to an industry-backed measure to cut
the stock fees that fund the Securities and Exchange Commission that
it passed on a voice vote.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it is Bush who has adjusted his course most dramatically since
the corporate scandals erupted.</TE>
<TE>   Even with his insistence that "the vast majority of businessmen
and [business]women are honest," the pointed criticism of corporate
executives in his speech was a hairpin reversal for a president who
has mostly praised business and drawn heavily on industry officials
to staff his government.</TE>
<TE>   At the SEC, for instance, Bush not only appointed former
accounting industry lobbyist Harvey L. Pitt as chairman, but has
sought to install two other industry alumni as members of the
five-member commission. Like other Bush regulators, Pitt initially
stressed his desire to pursue a less confrontational relationship
with business.</TE>
<TE>   "In general," Pitt said in November, "my preferred approach to any
regulatory issue is one in which the government's participation is as
limited as reasonably possible, while vigorously ensuring that the
public interest is protected."</TE>
<TE>   Measured against that starting point, Bush's agenda Tuesday marked
a striking level of new intervention, from a corporate fraud task
force in the Justice Department to increased penalties for mail fraud
and wire fraud, enhanced SEC authority to block payments to
executives while a company is under investigation and a plea for the
stock exchanges to approve rules requiring that a majority of all
corporate boards be composed of outside directors, a longtime
priority of investor groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Self-regulation is important, but it's not enough," Bush declared
in a formulation that came close to reversing Pitt's original credo.</TE>
<TE>   But as Democrats and investor advocates picked over the fine print
of what Bush said--and even more so what he didn't say--many argued
that government needed to do considerably more to meet those goals
than the president proposed.</TE>
<TE>   "There definitely has been movement by the administration," said
Ann Yerger, research director at the Council of Institutional
Investors, a coalition of pension funds and investment firms that
seeks corporate reform. But, referring to Bush and his aides as
"reluctant reformers," she added, "The question is whether the
changes go far enough. From our perspective ... we don't think they
do."</TE>
<TE>   Critics disliked only a few specific elements of Bush's proposals.
Gensler, for instance, said that Bush was still moving too timidly by
proposing to toughen penalties for mail and wire fraud--an indirect
way of pursuing stock manipulation--rather than establishing a clear
new criminal sanction against securities fraud, as Senate Democrats
want. Others complained that Bush's proposed $100-million increase in
funding for the Securities and Exchange Commission was only one-third
the level Senate Democrats are pushing.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, though, critics complained about what Bush didn't say.
Several noted that the president never endorsed the proposal from
Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) that the Senate is likely to approve
this week. That measure would establish an independent new oversight
board to regulate the accounting industry and limit the consulting
services accountants can provide for companies they audit.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Jon Corzine (D-N.J.), a leading sponsor of the Sarbanes bill,
termed Bush's speech "extremely weak," and "lacking in detail and
specifics."</TE>
<TE>   White House aides have hinted Bush might sign the Sarbanes bill if
it reaches him. But the more immediate question is whether Bush will
try to bring a bill to his desk by forging a compromise between the
House--which has passed a less stringent measure--and the Sarbanes
bill.</TE>
<TE>   The same political pressures that encouraged Bush to deliver
Tuesday's speech will pressure him to craft a compromise. But his
speech also showed that he remains skeptical that new laws and
regulations are the key to solving the problems unearthed in the last
several months.</TE>
<TE>   He seemed to be speaking most clearly from the heart when he
argued that it was as urgent to change business culture as business
law. While new statutes might help, he said, "we need men and women
of character who know the difference between ambition and destructive
greed, between justified risk and irresponsibility, between
enterprise and fraud."</TE>
<TE>   That argument touched on some of Bush's deepest beliefs about
government's role in society.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times just after the Columbine school
shooting, Bush made almost exactly the same case. While endorsing a
series of measures to control access to guns or limit children's
access to violent entertainment, he made clear that he considered all
of those public initiatives secondary to private change.</TE>
<TE>   Bush offered much the same balance Tuesday, suggesting that a key
to solving problems in the boardroom was for chief executives to set
a "moral tone." Embedded in that summons is the conviction that the
crisis of corporate ethics is primarily a problem of individuals who
go bad, rather than a financial system that encourages even good
people to make bad decisions--and a regulatory system that fails to
deter them.</TE>
<TE>   That fits with his broader belief in the primacy of individual
responsibility. But it may not be enough to resolve the anxiety of
spooked investors now depressing the stock market--or end the rising
criticism from Democrats who see the first chinks in Bush's political
armor since Sept. 11.</TE>

suicide pact that left him dead was sentenced to six months in jail.</LD>
<TE>   Mary Wendland, 42, admitted in court in St. Johns to giving her
nephew, Patrick Holey, and his wife, Jennifer, also 19, anti-nausea
medicine to combat the effects of painkillers they took in an effort
to kill themselves April 9.</TE>
<TE>   Wendland, who pleaded guilty to attempted assisted suicide, had

<HD>Bush Urges Tougher Laws to Fight Corporate Fraud</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: He calls for doubled prison terms and orders a
federal task force to fight business crime. He also focuses on
individual ethics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN and RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>President Bush, launching a new effort to combat corporate
corruption, Tuesday demanded longer prison sentences for business
executives who commit fraud and announced the creation of a federal
task force to help pursue and prosecute such criminals.</LD>
<LD>   Taking the presidential bully pulpit to Wall Street, Bush
delivered a stern lecture on business ethics and personal
responsibility as he unveiled his second plan this year to deal with
the accounting scandals and financial irregularities that have shaken
consumer faith in corporate America.</LD>
<LD>   The president vowed to "end the days of cooking the books, shading
the truth and breaking our laws" during the 27-minute speech that was
designed, in part, to restore investor confidence.</LD>
<TE>   But much of the initial reaction was negative, with critics
faulting Bush for failing to call for groundbreaking policy changes
some think are necessary to respond to the corporate accounting
scandals.</TE>
<TE>   In both his words and proposals, Bush put more emphasis on
pursuing and punishing individual wrongdoers than imposing systemic
changes to toughen oversight of the accounting industry or rules
governing pension plans. And while he called for more money and
personnel for the Securities and Exchange Commission, Congress
already is considering even larger increases.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the president called on Congress to enact
legislation to double to 10 years the maximum prison term for mail
fraud and wire fraud, laws often used in prosecuting corporate crime.</TE>
<TE>   He also called for strengthening laws that criminalize
document-shredding and other forms of obstruction of justice. A
senior administration official said that under Bush's proposal, the
government would be able to charge individuals with obstruction of
justice even if evidence-tampering took place before a subpoena had
been issued for documents.</TE>
<TE>   The Corporate Fraud Task Force, which Bush created with an
executive order, is responsible for better coordinating cross-agency
federal probes of financial crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Bush named Deputy Atty. Gen. Larry Thompson--Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft's top deputy--to head what the president described as a
"financial crimes SWAT team." The task force will include top
officials from several other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic lawmakers in Washington welcomed Bush's tough words but
said they were empty rhetoric unless accompanied by support for a
pending Senate bill that would tighten oversight of the accounting
industry and hold corporate officers more accountable for their
company's financial statements.</TE>
<TE>   "The test for the president today is not whether he shares the
outrage that the workers and shareholders ... feel," Senate Majority
Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said. "The question is whether he is
willing to take action on that outrage and support the legislation
that will actually help solve the problem."</TE>
<TE>   Daschle made his comments at a news conference where he was joined
by employees laid off by Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc., the two
businesses whose financial irregularities have played the major role
in spotlighting corporate misdeeds.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats vowed to press ahead with their bill, sponsored
by Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.). It is expected to pass this week,
increasing the pressure on Bush and House Republicans to accept a
measure that they have resisted as excessive.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's speech did not comfort investors. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 178.81 points, to 9,096.09, also as a result of a number
of corporate earning reports. But analysts said investors were
unlikely to be looking for Bush to provide a quick fix for the
market's various woes.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush said the right things, but the problem is there's no magic
bullet here," said Carl Domino, manager of the Northern Large Cap
Value stock mutual fund in West Palm Beach, Fla. "Clearly, some guys
need jail time, but the judicial system doesn't work overnight."</TE>
<TE>   The Business Roundtable, an association of chief executives of
major U.S. companies, said it "actively supports" Bush's proposals.</TE>
<TE>   The speech represented a notable turnabout for Bush, long a critic
of government meddling in the marketplace, to deliver a lecture to
Wall Street that the government would be closely watching its
behavior. It underscored the administration's concern about how the
accounting scandals could damage the economy and the president's
popularity.</TE>
<TE>   Bush reiterated his view that most business leaders are
law-abiding citizens, but added: "The business pages of America's
newspapers should not read like a scandal sheet."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the task force, Bush's proposals require action by
Congress, corporate executives, regulators, the stock exchanges or
companies themselves to take effect.</TE>
<TE>   Bush conceded that stricter enforcement of existing laws and
tougher new ones can do only so much. "Ultimately, the ethics of
American business depend on the conscience of America's business
leaders," the president said at a luncheon sponsored by the Assn. for
a Better New York and attended by about 1,000 community leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "We need men and women of character, who know the difference
between ambition and destructive greed, between justified risk and
irresponsibility, between enterprise and fraud," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush in March offered a 10-point plan for combating corporate
misconduct, with most of the proposals aimed at providing investors
with better information. His speech Tuesday signaled his awareness
that the plan had failed to quell public outrage over such
scandals--and had not inoculated his administration against the
perception that it is too close to big business.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than proposing a dramatic new regulatory system, Bush's new
plan focuses on beefing up the existing tools that the government has
in place.</TE>
<TE>   He called for new authority that would enable the SEC to freeze
improper payments to executives while their company is under
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   He asked Congress to approve an additional $100 million for the
SEC for fiscal year 2003, which begins Oct. 1. Earlier this year, the
administration proposed an SEC budget of $467 million, a 6.6%
increase over this year. Bush also called on Congress to pass a
$20-million supplemental funding request that would allow the SEC to
hire 100 new enforcement officers.</TE>
<TE>   But even many of Bush's Republican allies in Congress, along with
Democrats, have pushed to boost the SEC budget much more--to $776
million--to deal with the growing demand for more scrutiny of the
accounting practices of public companies.</TE>
<TE>   Bush directed some of his harshest language at corporate leaders,
who as a group have been among his strongest supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "Responsible leaders do not collect huge bonus packages when the
value of their company dramatically declines," he said. "Responsible
leaders do not take home tens of millions of dollars in compensation
as their companies prepare to file for bankruptcy, devastating the
holdings of their investors."</TE>
<TE>   Following up with recommendations, he called on public companies
to stop lending money to their officers and for chief executive
officers to "describe in plain English" their compensation packages
and explain how the payments serve the best interest of stockholders.</TE>
<TE>   Embracing a goal of many investor groups, he urged the exchanges
to approve rules requiring a majority of all corporate boards be
composed of outside directors.</TE>
<TE>   And he espoused what amounts to a one-strike-and-you're-out stance
against dishonest executives, saying that the SEC should be allowed
to bar them from ever serving again as officers or directors of
publicly held corporations.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's administration has drawn heavily from business ranks and
includes two former CEOs--Vice President Dick Cheney and Treasury
Secretary Paul H. O'Neill. Both men benefited from the type of
lucrative compensation packages that have become common in the
corporate world.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney, former chairman and chief executive of the Texas energy
firm Halliburton Co., caused controversy during the 2000 presidential
campaign by collecting an early-retirement stock package variously
valued from $20 million to almost $34 million. The company's board
granted Cheney the early-retirement send-off the day Bush named him
as his running mate. Executives at the time described the package as
"perfectly normal" and "plain vanilla."</TE>
<TE>   In his last year as Alcoa's chief executive, O'Neill made $36.2
million, including $33.1 million in stock options.</TE>
<TE>   Bush received a rousing welcome from his audience Tuesday as he
entered the ballroom of the Regent Wall Street Hotel in Lower
Manhattan--and again as he gave a brief update on the war on
terrorism. But his remarks on business morality and malfeasance
rarely evoked more than tepid applause.</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, reaction to the speech among Democrats was
typified by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.). He called it "long on
rhetoric and very short on details."</TE>
<TE>   "I welcome the fact that he has finally said something," Dodd
said. But, referring to the Sarbanes bill, he added: "Here we are
debating ... the most comprehensive reforms of the accounting
industry that this Senate has considered in years, and the president
had almost nothing to say about it."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) criticized Bush for not embracing
other measures, such as establishing a new securities fraud felony,
new protections for corporate whistle-blowers and extending the time
frame for investors to file securities fraud lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   GOP lawmakers dismissed the criticism as election-year
politicking. "Democrats are griping about cooked books so their goose
isn't cooked come November," said Rep. Mark Foley (R-Fla.).</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Josh Friedman, Peter Gosselin, Walter Hamilton
and Janet Hook contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Nominee Fends Off Tough Senate Questions</HD>
<DH>Politics: Surgeon general candidate Richard Carmona
discounts reports of mismanagement and personal battles. But former
colleagues dispute important details of his testimony.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY and ANN-EVE PEDERSEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Richard Carmona, President Bush's candidate for surgeon general,
described himself Tuesday as a "people's doctor" who ably managed a
trauma center, a hospital and a public health system in Tucson and
still had time to moonlight on the sheriff's SWAT team.</LD>
<LD>   Carmona, 52, testifying at his confirmation hearing before a
Senate committee, said his nomination as one of the nation's top
doctors was the culmination of "my apparently disjointed career
paths."</LD>
<LD>   "As I related to my young and very inquisitive daughter, it is as
if the fairy godmother reached out and touched me and cast me in the
best Disney movie ever made," Carmona said.</LD>
<TE>   Though the 90-minute hearing was cordial, Carmona faced questions
about his management skills, style and struggles to become board
certified as a surgeon. Several people told The Times that segments
of his testimony were misleading.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona, a high school dropout who went on to become a decorated
Vietnam War veteran and trauma surgeon, called the job he was
nominated for "the ultimate opportunity for public service."</TE>
<TE>   "Of necessity, ... the role of the United States surgeon general
has broadened significantly from that of traditional public health
responsibilities to now include the expanded leadership role of
addressing homeland defense and domestic preparedness," said Carmona,
who added that he would focus on prevention, both of disease and of
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   If confirmed as surgeon general, Carmona would wear a uniform and
be granted the rank of a three-star admiral in the commissioned
public health corps. The position has been highly visible over the
years, with occupants of the office such as C. Everett Koop becoming
household names and tackling controversial health issues.</TE>
<TE>   But it is a job done largely from the bully pulpit. Although the
surgeon general has the 5,600 commissioned officer corps, whose
duties range from control of contagious diseases to disaster relief,
the office itself has only a small staff and relies almost entirely
on the generosity of Congress to fund studies and outreach projects.</TE>
<TE>   Several members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension
Committee asked Carmona to explain rocky episodes while a medical
administrator and the struggles he had getting board certification.
Those were reported in The Times on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona said he was "disappointed" in the story and attributed the
complaints to people from his past who had been unable to put
disagreements behind them.</TE>
<TE>   Committee Chairman Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) asked Carmona about
the accuracy of the report that he had twice failed his surgery
boards. Carmona would only say he had passed the exam "in the time
allotted."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody has ever questioned my competency or my
ability as a surgeon," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy asked Carmona about his departure in 1999 from his job as
head of the Pima County Health System, a move that the Tucson press
reported as being the outcome of a showdown between Carmona and the
county health commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona said he started the job with the intention of staying one
year, grew tired of it after three years and by the fourth year "had
been trying to leave."</TE>
<TE>   "I had put a very definite time to leave at the end of that
contract year, and I did so," he said. "Some people, for their own
benefit, chose to characterize this as being forced out, but it was
not so."</TE>
<TE>   Sylvia Campoy, then the county health commission chairwoman, said
Tuesday that Carmona never had an agreement to stay for one year
only. She said Carmona still had 18 months left on his contract when
he negotiated his resignation so the county had to buy it out for
$70,000. Just prior to his resignation, Carmona told the Tucson
Weekly that he still had "unfinished business" but would be willing
to go if he had become a source of divisiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy seemed satisfied with Carmona's answers, telling him at
hearing's end, "I'm confident you'll be confirmed."</TE>
<TE>   Carmona was asked by Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) about a reported
incident in which Carmona, then head of the Tucson Medical Center's
trauma unit, had a dispute with Angie Calvino, a nurse who had
complained to her supervisor about Carmona's decision in a case
involving a child. Carmona had demanded her resignation, saying she
had breached protocol.</TE>
<TE>   Calvino accepted a demotion after Carmona agreed not to report her
to the state nursing board. Later he reported her anyway, according
to a former hospital official.</TE>
<TE>   Reed questioned whether the incident represented a double
standard, in light of Carmona's reputation as a "swashbuckling"
doctor who didn't mind taking risks to protect his patients.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona told Reed he was required by law to report the nurse, that
she had problems and had only come to work with his unit because "she
couldn't carry her own weight" in the emergency department.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency room doctors and more than half a dozen nurses reached
Tuesday said Calvino had no problem doing her job. In fact, after
Calvino was demoted, all but one of the nurses she worked with wrote
a joint letter to the Tucson Medical Center board in her support,
saying they no longer had faith in Carmona.</TE>
<TE>   A former hospital official, who requested not to be named on the
advice of legal counsel, said Calvino was a staff member in good
standing at the time of the dispute and that Carmona had been under
no legal obligation, as he contended, to report her to the board.</TE>
<TE>   Calvino, reached overseas where she is living with her husband,
called Carmona's comments "totally untrue" but "predictable."</TE>
<TE>   "We never had any competency issues [with Calvino] as far as I'm
concerned," said Nancy Mattingly, who was the nursing director of
emergency services and Calvino's supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a very compassionate person," Mattingly said. "She was a
patient advocate and sometimes she did get into hot water because she
thought she was sticking up for the patients."</TE>
<TE>   Times special correspondent Maureen O'Connell in Tucson
contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>$60 Purchase a $10-Million Michelangelo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A chalk and wash drawing found in a box in a New York City design
museum is a work by Michelangelo worth more than $10 million, museum
officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The drawing of a candelabrum is about 500 years old and in
pristine condition.</LD>
<LD>   It has been authenticated by Italian Renaissance art scholars and
is one of fewer than 10 Michelangelos known to be in the United
States, according to Paul Thompson, director of the Smithsonian's
Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum.</LD>
<TE>   The 17- by 10-inch drawing on cream-colored paper was made using
black chalk, brush and brown wash with incised lines. The museum
bought it for $60 in 1942 in a collection from an English estate. It
was labeled "Italian, circa 1530-1540." Its current value is between
$10 million and $12 million, art dealers said.</TE>
<TE>   Italian Renaissance scholar Sir Timothy Clifford discovered the
work in April inside a box of light fixture designs by unknown
artists.</TE>
<TE>   "He brought out a drawing and said, 'My goodness, this is a
Michelangelo!' " Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Clifford said he believes the rendering is of a seven-branched
candelabrum in the form of a menorah and that the completed object
was to be at least 6 feet tall.</TE>
<TE>   "To find a new drawing by Michelangelo is very exciting, but to
find a drawing by him of a menorah and, moreover, in New York, is
almost incredible," said Clifford, director of the National Galleries
of Scotland, Edinburgh, who was on sabbatical at Cooper-Hewitt.</TE>
<TE>   Clifford said he believes the drawing relates to the Medici tombs
project. Pope Clement VII commissioned the funerary chapel in 1524,
and various designs were discussed but the project was abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   Although art experts agree the drawing is by Michelangelo, they
are not sure that it is of a menorah or that it was meant for the
Medici tombs, said Sarah Lawrence, director of the Cooper-Hewitt
Masters Program in the History of Decorative Arts.</TE>
<TE>   Only six public institutions in the United States have
Michelangelos, Thompson said. The museum plans to display the work
within a year.</TE>

<HD>Florida Death Row Pauses as Justices Rethink Law</HD>
<DH>Crime: The state court's stay of two executions casts doubt
on the fate of 371 similar cases. The move could have national
implications.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Linroy Bottoson, a convicted murderer, had eaten his final meal of
seafood, fried chicken, apple pie and butter-pecan ice cream. But six
hours before the 63-year-old was supposed to die by injection,
Florida's Supreme Court halted his execution.</LD>
<LD>   The justices wanted to reconsider whether the state's death
penalty is constitutional, in light of a recent U.S. Supreme Court
ruling. Their action Monday threw capital cases across Florida into
uncertainty and raised the possibility that all 371 inmates on the
state's death row could have their sentences overturned. It also
could have national repercussions.</LD>
<LD>   "It's going to produce a lot of litigation and the need for a lot
of hearings and legal work to get to the point where it's all
clarified," predicted Nancy Daniels, a public defender in
Tallahassee.</LD>
<TE>   The surprise 6-1 decision by Florida's highest court to
temporarily stay the executions of Bottoson and 47-year-old Amos Lee
King Jr.--another killer who was scheduled to die today--was
motivated by the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in an Arizona case.</TE>
<TE>   In Ring vs. Arizona, the high court said only a jury, and not a
judge alone, can impose a death sentence. The justices' decision
threw out the death penalty laws in Arizona and four other states:
Colorado, Idaho, Montana and Nebraska. Legal scholars said it still
is uncertain how the ruling applies to Florida, Alabama, Delaware and
Indiana, where juries make recommendations on whether a criminal
should live or die but the judge makes the final decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Before another person is executed in this state, the only
responsible decision that this court can make ... is to reevaluate
this court's opinions on this issue," Florida Justice Barbara
Pariente said Monday. "Given the gravity of the issue and the
potential impact on our state's judicial system," added Justice Major
B. Harding, "I think this court must proceed with caution."</TE>
<TE>   The court has scheduled oral arguments on the issue for Aug. 21 in
Tallahassee.</TE>
<TE>   Republican Gov. Jeb Bush's position is that the U.S. Supreme Court
ruling has no bearing on Florida or its 1972 statute on capital
punishment. Bush signed death warrants for Bottoson and King last
week, well after the June 24 decision in the Arizona case.</TE>
<TE>   Bottoson was convicted of robbing a postmaster in 1979, holding
her captive for more than three days, stabbing her 16 times and then
crushing her to death with a car. A jury voted, 10 to 2, to recommend
the death penalty. (Monday's final meal was, in fact, Bottoson's
second; in February, he came within three hours of execution.)</TE>
<TE>   King was convicted of murdering a woman in 1997. This week's stay
of execution was his third.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement after the Florida Supreme Court's ruling, Bush
spokeswoman Elizabeth E. Hirst complained that "justice is long
overdue for the families of the victims murdered by Bottoson and
King." The governor was reviewing the court order, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Simon, a professor of criminal procedure at the
University of Miami law school, said the law in Florida and other
states with similar sentencing mechanisms in capital cases probably
will need to be rewritten to pass constitutional muster. "Voters
around the country, whether they like it or not, are going to be
confronted with what they want to do about the death penalty."</TE>
<TE>   "The 300-plus cases on Florida's death row could very well be
commuted to life or sent back for some kind of new sentencing
process," Simon said. "Either way, that's a very dramatic
development."</TE>
<TE>   Of the states potentially affected by the U.S. Supreme Court's
decision, Florida has the largest number of inmates sentenced to die.
And any decision it makes could fuel a trend. "It looks like the
public has strong support for the death penalty," Daniels said. "But
in light of recent revelations about the fairness of the system,
people are saying they want this looked at more closely."</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-one people have been released from Florida's death row
because DNA or other evidence cast strong doubt on their convictions,
said Michael Radelet, a professor of sociology and a specialist on
capital punishment at the University of Colorado. In 166 instances,
he said, Florida judges have disregarded a jury's recommendation and
imposed a death sentence. Four such convicts have been executed.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Justice Charles T. Wells was the sole member of the Florida
Supreme Court to vote against staying this week's scheduled
executions, objecting that the Ring decision "deals with Arizona."
Wells noted that last week the U.S. Supreme Court itself declined to
hear Bottoson's arguments that he should not be executed and lifted
an earlier stay of execution issued for him.</TE>

<HD>GAO Report Faults Alaska Oil Cleanup Plans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Cleaning up the massive web of roads, drilling pads, production
facilities and pipelines on Alaska's North Slope could cost $2.7
billion to $6 billion, but oil companies have put up only a fraction
of the money and are not legally obligated to meet any specific
standards, the General Accounting Office said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In a report commissioned by congressional Democrats opposed to
expanded oil drilling in the Arctic, the GAO said standards are
"generally insufficient to ensure that any federal lands disturbed by
oil industry activities will be restored," and urged regulators to
issue specific restoration requirements as well as assure there will
be adequate funds to meet them as oil production winds down in the
next several decades.</LD>
<LD>   "The need for federal ... restoration requirements, and assurances
that funds will be available to meet those requirements, is becoming
increasingly important," the agency said. The current bonding
requirements for oil companies operating on federal land--about
$500,000 each--"would cover only a fraction of the potential costs"
of recovery, the report concluded.</LD>
<TE>   Alaska officials criticized the report, saying its production at
the request of opponents of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge seemed "to call into question the GAO's credibility."</TE>
<TE>   "So far as Alaska is aware, the power and resources of the GAO
have never before been devoted to the investigation of state
practices on state lands," Pat Pourchot, commissioner of the state
Department of Natural Resources, said in a response. The GAO
acknowledged that state lands are Alaska's concern but said upcoming
oil leases on federal lands should be subject to tighter federal
regulation. State officials said they have imposed a strict cleanup
mandate on North Slope oil operators that is deliberately vague,
specifying that oil companies return the land to a condition
"satisfactory to the state." That way, they said, the state can hold
oil companies to standards that seem appropriate when the Prudhoe Bay
and surrounding oil fields actually close--an event that is still 30
to 50 years away.</TE>
<TE>   The North Slope oil fields, America's largest, range over an
89,000-square-mile area of tundra and permafrost and include more
than 3,108 active well sites, along with hundreds of miles of roads
and pipelines and industrial processing facilities.</TE>
<TE>   House Democratic leaders sought to explore what would happen to
the Arctic when the oil industry leaves as Congress debates opening
to oil production some new federal lands, from the National Petroleum
Reserve-Alaska on the west side to the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge on the east. Most production until now has been on Alaska
state-owned lands or offshore, in the Beaufort Sea.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), one of the lawmakers who
commissioned the report, condemned the oil companies for refusing to
release their own estimates of how much the cleanup will cost.</TE>
<TE>   Industry officials said that, to the contrary, North Slope
operators have demonstrated their commitment, spending millions of
dollars in an ongoing program to clean up stockpiles of old drilling
wastes and have even cleaned up sites abandoned by previous oil
producers on the North Slope.</TE>
<TE>   "The company has the resources and is fully committed to meeting
its [recovery] responsibilities in Alaska. Those activities have
already started and will stretch over decades," BP Alaska spokesman
Ronnie Chappell said.</TE>
<TE>   Chappell conceded that industry leaders would like the state to be
more specific about what is expected in final cleanup. "It's the
eternal question of how clean is clean, and the answer to that
question I think will always change based on new scientific
information and the expectation of stakeholders," he said.</TE>
<TE>   While the GAO advised looking at the relatively small bonding
guarantee required of oil companies for cleanup, it found that
Alaska's money requirements are stronger than those of most other
oil-producing states. Alaska officials said there was no doubt the
major multinational oil companies working on the North Slope would be
able to come up with the money.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups welcomed the GAO findings, saying that oil
industry powerhouses could hand off to smaller, less viable companies
as production winds down and leave taxpayers holding the bag for
cleanup.</TE>

<HD>'SWAT Team' to Ferret Out White-Collar Crimes</HD>
<DH>Inquiries: Bush creates a federal task force to help pursue
and prosecute business lawbreakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Just six weeks ago, the FBI announced plans to move dozens of agents
out of white-collar crime probes and into counter-terrorism as part
of a new post-Sept. 11 mandate.</LD>
<LD>   But that was before the latest wave of corporate scandals hit
Washington. On Tuesday, President Bush delivered a very different
message, creating a "financial crimes SWAT team" to investigate
white-collar crimes to try to win back the public's shaken
confidence.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than de-emphasizing white-collar crime investigations by
federal law enforcement, Bush said he wants his newly created
corporate fraud task force--made up of senior law enforcement
officials--to better guide and coordinate investigations across
different federal departments.</LD>
<TE>   The president's creation of the high-level task force, along with
a litany of tough new penalties for corporate criminals that he also
announced Tuesday, signal a significant change for the administration
in its law enforcement priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Implicit in his message was the sense that federal agencies have
not been doing a good enough job in marshaling their collective
resources to go after major fraud in corporate America. Some critics
questioned why it should take a scandal at WorldCom Inc. or Enron
Corp. to make that happen.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no objection to forming a task force," said Sen. Patrick
J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, "but
the administration should already be requiring federal agencies to
cooperate on corporate fraud cases, and it should not take a task
force to make that happen."</TE>
<TE>   Leading the redoubled effort will be Deputy Atty. Gen. Larry
Thompson, a former federal prosecutor in Atlanta who is the top
deputy to Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft.</TE>
<TE>   Bush named Thompson to head a task force that will include other
top officials of the Justice Department, the Treasury Department, the
FBI, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal
Communications Commission and other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The committee's charge is to "strengthen the efforts" of the
federal government in investigating financial crimes, coordinate
cross-agency probes and develop new policies and priorities,
according to Bush's order.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson already has a lengthy resume in the area of white-collar
crime. He worked extensively in defending white-collar crime cases as
a private attorney in Atlanta, and he has personally overseen the
Justice Department's ongoing Enron investigation because Ashcroft
recused himself from the case, citing contributions he received from
Enron executives.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign finance activists have called on Thompson to step down
from the Enron investigation as well because his former law firm in
Atlanta represented both Enron and Arthur Andersen, the accounting
firm convicted of obstruction of justice in the Enron probe. But
Thompson has rejected that suggestion, saying he has no conflict in
running the case.</TE>
<TE>   "Larry's 16 years of white-collar [defense] work make him uniquely
qualified for an assignment like this," said an administration
official who asked not to be identified. "His integrity is beyond
question, and he calls it as he sees it."</TE>
<TE>   One of Thompson's toughest tasks will be finding the resources to
expand the investigation of white-collar crime even as the
administration is stepping up the fight against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   In late May, when FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III announced a
reorganization of the bureau to better combat terrorism, white-collar
crime was one of the casualties. Mueller's plan will redeploy 59
agents from white-collar crime, plus another 59 agents from violent
crime and 400 agents from narcotics, and commit them to an expanded
counter-terrorism operation.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials, who admitted that they were caught off-guard by
Bush's announcement, said they have no plans to send the redeployed
agents back to white-collar investigations. But the FBI and other law
enforcement officials acknowledged that the White House plan raises
the stakes in probes of financial wrongdoing and gives it a much
higher visibility.</TE>
<TE>   "For the last 15 or 20 years, white-collar crime has not been
given the priority it should have had in law enforcement.... There's
simply been no great pressure from the outside to deal with
white-collar crime," said Robert S. Litt, a former Justice Department
official who is now in private practice in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Litt said the public clamor surrounding recent billion-dollar
earnings adjustments and allegations of corporate wrongdoing is
driving the move. "This wasn't proposed six weeks ago or six months
ago," he said. "It was proposed now because I think people are
suddenly saying 'Gee, there's a problem here,' and that's because
there's been so much about it in the media."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's plan calls for increased funding at the SEC for
investigators. But Litt and other legal observers said that the
impact of his new corporate crime task force will be muted unless the
administration comes up with significant new resources to dedicate
FBI agents and federal prosectors to the task of cracking down on
corporate crime.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many white-collar crimes that are going unprosecuted
right now" because federal authorities do not have enough
investigators and prosecutors to pursue them, said Paul Fishman, a
former federal prosecutor who now handles white-collar defense work
in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft, in a statement, did not indicate whether the department
would commit new resources to financial crimes. But he said Bush's
plan "will bring a new measure of accountability to American
businesses" by deterring crimes through stiffened penalties.</TE>
<TE>   "With the added weight of the Corporate Fraud Task Force,"
Ashcroft said, "we will continue to hold accountable those
individuals and entities who violate the public trust, undermine our
free enterprise system and put at risk the retirement savings of
American workers."</TE>

<HD>Muslim Female Activists Are Honored</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Last fall, Mehrangiz Kar, an outspoken critic of discrimination
against women and non-Muslims in Iran, was released from prison where
she had been held since the spring of 2000, accused of acting against
that country's national security interests.</LD>
<LD>   Stricken with cancer, Kar--a lawyer, activist and journalist--was
freed on bail and permitted to travel to the West to seek medical
treatment.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, Kar's life took another dramatic turn: She and three
other Muslim women were honored on Capitol Hill, where First Lady
Laura Bush and members of Congress joined the National Endowment for
Democracy in celebrating their outstanding contributions in the
Muslim world.</LD>
<TE>   "We recognize these four women for their courage and their
tenacity," Bush said. "They speak out against terrorism and
injustice.... We look to their countries and we call on them to keep
the promise of freedom that people yearn for so desperately."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview before the ceremony, Kar said many Iranian
activists look to leaders for encouragement and education about the
kinds of freedoms that some Americans may take for granted. "I hope I
could do better for my country and I hope that the activists in Iran
that are now in danger could be more secure," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Also honored Tuesday were Nadjet Bouda of Algeria, Mariam Hussein
Mohamed of Somalia and Muborak Tashpulatova of Uzbekistan. All were
cited for their work in countries where a majority of the population
is Muslim.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's widespread recognition that the participation of
women in society is a critical issue, and a way to address long-term
struggles," said Carl Gershman, head of the organization.</TE>
<TE>   Bouda's activism began when, at age 16, she joined Rally for Youth
Action, a nongovernmental organization that works with Algerian
youth. By age 20, she was the group's president. Now 23, she works
with SOS Disparus, which advocates on behalf of Algerians who have
"disappeared" in that country's long civil dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Bouda said the award "is a way to recognize not only my work but
all Algerian activists who are fighting every day for freedom and
democracy."</TE>
<TE>   Hussein Mohamed founded and heads the Dr. Ismail Jumale Human
Rights Organization, a leading human rights group in Somalia. She
also co-founded the Peace and Human Rights Network, a consortium of
24 Somali civil rights groups.</TE>
<TE>   Tashpulatova heads the Tashkent Public Education Center, which
produces textbooks on civic education. She has also held town
hall-style forums for groups of parents, students and government
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The National Endowment for Democracy is a private, nonprofit group
working to strengthen democratic institutions. It is active in more
than 90 countries.</TE>
<TE>   Sens. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) and Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) were
on hand for the presentation.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that [National Endowment for Democracy] has done more to
promote democracy around the world than any other organization,"
Biden said.</TE>
<TE>   "You know we [in Congress] debate and vote, and we take
controversial stands," he told the recipients. "If we lose, we get
defeated and we get a pension. If you lose, you get shot. If you
lose, you get imprisoned. This is the real test, the real genuine
test of a commitment to democracy."</TE>
<TE>   For Kar, the battle continues.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, Siamak Pourzand, a journalist and critic of the
government in Iran, was seized by hard-line Islamic fundamentalists
and his whereabouts are uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what I can do for my husband, what I can do for
myself, what I can do for my family," Kar said in the interview.
"Everything is dark, nothing is clear."</TE>
<TE>   But her outlook for Iran remains undimmed.</TE>
<TE>   "In Iran now some movements are beginning to show themselves--the
women's rights movement, the young people's movement, [the]
university movement, [the] press movement, [the] intellectual
movement," she said. "All of them are showing themselves to the
government and they're showing their strength. They are trying to
have the government hear their voice."</TE>

<HD>Senate OKs Nevada Nuclear Waste Site</HD>
<DH>Energy: As Congress grants final approval for the
much-disputed plan, opponents vow to sue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON and TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration's plan to open the first national
nuclear-waste burial ground at Nevada's Yucca Mountain won final
congressional approval Tuesday, a landmark action that could open the
door to a new era of growth for the long-stalled nuclear energy
industry.</LD>
<LD>   A Republican-led majority rammed the plan through the Senate after
only a few hours of debate, despite fierce opposition from Nevadans,
the Democratic leadership and many environmentalists. The Senate's
approval, on a voice vote, came after the plan survived a decisive
60-39 roll call on a key procedural question. The House approved the
plan in May, 306 to 117.</LD>
<LD>   Advocates contended that government studies costing billions of
dollars had found the site suitable for storing high-level
radioactive waste for up to 10,000 years.</LD>
<TE>   But critics said the administration failed to prove that the
deadly material could be safely stored beneath the volcanic ridge
just 90 miles northwest of fast-growing Las Vegas--and roughly 20
miles from the California border. They also claimed that shipping the
waste from states around the country, along the nation's highways and
rails, would invite terrorist attacks or risk a catastrophic
accident.</TE>
<TE>   The vote was a major victory for both the nuclear industry, which
has been lobbying for a waste storage site for more than 20 years,
and President Bush, who has made expansion of nuclear power a prime
goal of his energy policy. Employees at an Energy Department office
in Las Vegas erupted in whoops and cheers after the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Bush endorsed the Yucca Mountain plan in February, reversing the
Clinton administration's course of delay. Bush's predecessor, in
fact, vetoed a plan for storing waste at Yucca Mountain two years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   With Tuesday's action, Nevada's attempt to block the new federal
plan through a gubernatorial veto in April was overridden. The
administration now can apply for a license from the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission to build the facility. It would open, if all
goes as planned, in roughly a decade.</TE>
<TE>   The White House had no immediate comment on the Senate action.
Earlier, the administration released a statement urging approval of
the plan as "important to a number of critical national interests,
including national security, energy security, homeland security and
protection of the environment."</TE>
<TE>   But opponents still plan to fight every step of the way--in
government agencies and in court.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. Senate vote today is the beginning of Nevada's legal and
regulatory fight to stop the Yucca Mountain project," said Nevada
Gov. Kenny Guinn, a Republican. Although the congressional action
does not guarantee that nuclear waste will be stored at Yucca
Mountain, it shifted the debate significantly. Now the government and
the nuclear industry can plan on the assumption that a permanent
repository for up to 77,000 tons of radioactive waste is moving
forward.</TE>
<TE>   Had Congress failed to act, the plan--in the works since
1982--would have died.</TE>
<TE>   That outcome would have been devastating to an industry that fell
from public favor after a dangerous accident in 1979 at a power plant
in Pennsylvania. The Three Mile Island incident helped spur the
cancellation of plans for many new nuclear power plants; others have
since been closed.</TE>
<TE>   Although nuclear power supplies about 20% of all electricity
generated in the United States through reactors at 103 plants, the
Bush administration noted last year in its energy policy report that
no new plant construction has been successfully ordered since 1973.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of nuclear power have long argued that plans for
expanding nuclear plants should be shelved because there is no place
to put radioactive waste. Now the industry can parry that argument.</TE>
<TE>   "This is another piece of evidence that the nuclear industry is
alive and well and likely to prosper in years to come," said Jay
Silberg, an attorney in Washington for several nuclear utilities.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers who back nuclear power said Congress must support a
waste-storage plan if the industry is to survive. Currently, spent
fuel rods are accumulating at 131 sites in 39 states.</TE>
<TE>   "I know how hard it is to explain to people this can be done in a
safe and responsible way," said Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.), the
minority leader, whose own state dodged designation as a potential
waste-storage site in the 1980s. "But we have to deal with it. And if
we don't take this action, we don't deal with it, then we're going to
have to shut down this source of energy in the country, slowly but
surely. And I think that would be a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) denounced the plan, saying nuclear waste
will continue to pile up around the country even if the Yucca project
goes forward. Waving a government document angrily on the Senate
floor, he said: "This piece of trash--that's what it is--is typical
of what the Department of Energy has done. It's one big lie after one
big lie."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the debate centered on whether the waste could be moved
safely. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) showed maps of Sacramento and
Los Angeles, pointing to routes--near schools, hospitals and the
homes of millions of people--that she said could soon be used to move
the waste. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Boxer said, "you
would think this administration would think twice or three times or
six times before they give the order for this waste to move."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska) replied that transportation
plans remained undecided.</TE>
<TE>   In the critical procedural vote, Boxer and Sen. Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.) joined 33 other Democrats and independent Sen. James M.
Jeffords of Vermont in opposition to the plan. Just three Republicans
opposed it: Sens. John Ensign of Nevada, Ben Nighthorse Campbell of
Colorado and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada, which has spent $3 million on advertising to defeat the
plan, is not giving up. It has already filed a handful of federal
lawsuits to fight the project. More are coming.</TE>
<TE>   "We're real confident about our legal cases," said Bob Loux, who
heads Nevada's nuclear energy office. "We only have to win one of
those cases, and any one of them is fatal to the process. The
government has to win them all."</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys hired by the state said they will attack the plan on
legal, environmental, technical and procedural fronts.</TE>
<TE>   "The real battle will be in the courts and before the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, where we'll find a level of objectivity you'll
never find in the political arena," said Joseph R. Egan, one of the
state's lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   One lawsuit challenges the adequacy of the government's
environmental impact statement--specifically whether it has
sufficiently studied the possibility of radioactive leakage from
Yucca Mountain. A lawsuit under consideration would challenge the
constitutionality of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the 1982 law that
led to the Yucca Mountain plan.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the issue now moves from Capitol Hill to the Bush
administration. The Department of Energy's application for the Yucca
Mountain site is due to be submitted to go before the NRC within
three months.</TE>
<TE>   In a preliminary review, the NRC has already raised 293 technical
and scientific issues "where additional information is needed," said
Sue Gagner, an agency spokeswoman. The department has not yet replied
to all of the questions, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The issues generally deal with how water flows through Yucca
Mountain, the effect heat would have on the water, how nuclear waste
containers will withstand corrosion and how radioactive materials
will be transported--both across country to reach Nevada and within
the mountain itself.</TE>
<TE>   The NRC's review, expected to last four years, will be conducted
by its staff and consultants and will include public hearings in
Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Some in Nevada say the state should simply prepare for the arrival
of nuclear waste.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time that Nevada begins to openly talk about Plan B," said
Robert List, who served as the state's GOP governor from 1979 to 1983
and who was hired by the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry's
trade organization, to smooth the waters in his home state.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be the world's largest public works project," List said
of Yucca Mountain, expected to cost upward of $70 billion. "Surely,
we ought to seize the opportunity to make lemons into lemonade." The
state may also be in line for federal impact funds.</TE>

<LD>Three years ahead of schedule, scientists have unexpectedly halted a
critical clinical trial testing the effects of hormone replacement
therapy on women after menopause because of a slight but significant
increase in the risk of breast cancer, heart attacks, blood clots and
strokes.</LD>
<LD>   The trial, which tracked 16,608 women taking either the hormones
estrogen and progestin or a placebo for five years, was brought to an
end after a review in late May made it clear that the risks of the
hormone regimen outweighed the benefits.</LD>
<LD>   The findings are to be published in the Journal of the American
Medical Assn. next week but were released Tuesday because of their
medical importance.</LD>
<TE>   The study, part of a large government-funded research program
known as the Women's Health Initiative, deals a serious blow to the
long-term use of hormone replacement therapy as a disease prevention
strategy. The therapy is used for varying durations by an estimated
38% of post-menopausal women.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the study we've been waiting for, for years and years,"
said Dr. Howard Judd, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Olive
View-UCLA Medical Center and a principal investigator at one of the
three study sites in the Los Angeles area. "The results should have
profound effects on hormone replacement--or if they don't, they
should."</TE>
<TE>   Many women may still opt to take hormones for short spells to
treat symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes, night sweats, mood
swings and vaginal dryness.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers also found in their study that hormone replacement
therapy led to reductions in risks for colorectal cancer and hip
fractures.</TE>
<TE>   Such benefits, however, can be achieved with other drugs and
lifestyle changes that do not confer the same risks as hormone
replacement therapy, the researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   "You're hard pressed to say 'take estrogen to prevent colorectal
cancer' if you see someone's more likely to develop breast cancer,
have a heart attack, a stroke or a clot in the lungs or the legs,"
said Marcia Stefanick, associate professor of medicine at Stanford
University, principal investigator of one of the 40 clinical centers
and chairwoman of the Women's Health Initiative steering committee.</TE>
<TE>   The authors concluded there is no longer any rationale for taking
hormones for long-term protection of the heart. Despite a wealth of
epidemiological evidence suggesting such protection, this more
rigorous, placebo-controlled study failed to find it.</TE>
<TE>   "The findings are important--and I think they're conclusive,"
commented Dr. Stephen Hulley, professor and chairman of the
department of epidemiology at UC San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Experts also noted that the heightened risks are small. Out of
10,000 women in a year, the therapy would lead to eight more cases of
breast cancer, seven more heart attacks, eight more strokes and 18
more cases of blood clots in the veins or lungs.</TE>
<TE>   Because the effect is small, there is plenty of time for women to
digest the new information and carefully weigh the options with their
doctors. Some may decide, after doing so, to continue taking
hormones.</TE>
<TE>   It could still turn out that estrogen alone does not carry the
same risk as taking estrogen with progestin, which is added to
hormone replacement regimes to protect against the risk of uterine
cancer. Another trial within the Women's Health Initiative is testing
the effects of estrogen on women who have had hysterectomies. That
study, which is continuing, has so far detected no increase in breast
cancer rates.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's study was initiated in 1993. A plethora of
epidemiological evidence suggested that women who opted for hormone
replacement therapy were less likely to develop heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   To conclusively show the link, the study enrolled 16,608 healthy
women ages 50 to 69, all of whom had entered menopause.</TE>
<TE>   The health outcomes were reviewed periodically by a safety
monitoring board. Twice earlier--in 2000 and 2001--the board reported
that there were slight increases of heart disease, stroke and
deep-vein blood clot risks. However, at those earlier points there
was no statistically significant increase in overall risk.</TE>
<TE>   But the risks persisted and were joined by that of an increase in
breast cancer in later years.</TE>
<TE>   The results of the study were not entirely surprising, experts
said. After the Women's Health Initiative had begun, other trials had
reported on the effects of hormone replacement on patients who had
preexisting heart disease. They, too, reported an increased risk of
cardiovascular problems in early years and no overall benefit to the
heart.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists do not know why the earlier epidemiological studies
should have led them to believe that hormones confer a significant
protection against heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   It has been suspected for some time that women who opt to take
hormones and continue to take them may be different from those who
either never take them or soon drop them. They may have healthier
lifestyles, are richer and have better access to health care.</TE>
<TE>   It may be impossible to control for such differences, and that is
problematic for a condition like heart disease, which depends so much
on lifestyle choices, said Dr. JoAnn Manson, a Women's Health
Initiative investigator and chief of preventive medicine at Brigham
and Women's Hospital in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Wulf Utian, executive director of the North American Menopause
Society, said the results are "disappointing."</TE>
<TE>   However, he and others point out, it is still possible that
different doses and forms of estrogen and progestin, perhaps
delivered by a patch instead of orally, could turn out to have
different risks and benefits.</TE>
<TE>   But to prove it would take more studies on the scale of the
Women's Health Initiative, and few scientists believe the funding
would be forthcoming.</TE>

<HD>Forget New Laws--Fix the Old Ones</HD>
<DH>Bush's plan shows he's not serious about addressing
business fraud.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER ARLEN</AU>
<BD>Jennifer Arlen is a professor of law at NYU Law School
who specializes in securities fraud and business crime.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush would have us believe that new federal laws are what's
necessary to solve the problem of corporate fraud in the United
States. Instead, he should have proposed reform of existing federal
laws that contributed to the problem in the first place.</LD>
<LD>   Calling for harsher jail sentences for executives convicted of
securities fraud sounds tough, but it would have little effect.</LD>
<LD>   The president knows full well that the stiffer sentences would
rarely be imposed because corporate executives are so infrequently
convicted of securities fraud: It is very difficult to prove--beyond
a reasonable doubt--the intent to defraud.</LD>
<TE>   Tougher criminal sanctions are not the solution, but there are
many things Bush could do. First, and most important, he must restore
the power of investors to sue for civil damages. Second, he must
change the federal laws that presented the temptations for executives
to commit fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Top executives now receive most of their compensation in the form
of stock or stock options. This means they stand to make millions
from even a short-term increase in share price. The promise of
instant riches presents an overwhelming temptation to misstate
earnings.</TE>
<TE>   The dramatic increase in options is not the natural product of
market forces but rather the result of federal laws that distort the
accounting treatment of executive compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Current federal law permits companies to deduct the cost of
options on their tax returns while not disclosing this cost on the
earnings statements they provide to shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   This government-sanctioned financial misstatement has encouraged
outrageous options grants by enabling companies to effectively pay
executives millions "free"--at least as far as the shareholders are
told.</TE>
<TE>   European countries do not account for options grants in the way
the U.S. usually does. As a result, executives of European companies
receive more compensation in cash and thus do not face the temptation
to distort share price.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, however, continues to resist any effort to reform this
government-sanctioned accounting distortion.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law also exacerbated the current situation by removing the
central impediments to securities fraud. Government regulators alone
cannot deter fraud. Effective deterrence requires that
shareholders--the victims of the fraud--be able to sue those who
perpetrate fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, executives contemplating fraud did face a serious
risk of being sued by shareholders. These suits not only helped deter
fraud and compensate victims, they also helped bring potential
wrongdoing to the attention of government regulators.</TE>
<TE>   But in the mid-1990s, Congress not only adopted legislation making
it much more difficult to bring securities fraud actions, it granted
executives the right to seek dismissal before the shareholder had
access to "discovery," a court- supervised process to facilitate
plaintiff investigation of corporate wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Denying discovery is unusual. In other areas, plaintiffs are
permitted to use the power of the courts to investigate wrongdoing.
The denial of discovery not only hurts private plaintiffs but also
hurts government enforcement efforts because regulators previously
benefited from the information gleaned by private plaintiffs about
securities fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Congress went beyond altering federal law and also intervened to
prevent shareholders from suing for damages for securities fraud
under state law. This legislation undercutting states' efforts was
adopted by the very Republican-led Congress that in other areas had
championed states' rights.</TE>
<TE>   Deterring securities fraud requires removal of these impediments
to litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders should be permitted to sue for securities fraud and
should be given time to investigate wrongdoing. They also should be
permitted discovery if there is credible evidence of potential
securities fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The law should be changed to ensure that the responsible
executives bear the financial burden of their frauds, as opposed to
liability being imposed on the corporation itself, and thus on the
very shareholders injured by the fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, greater disclosure by management of its trading activity
is necessary. This would reduce the gain to executives from trading
as well as enable the markets to examine management's own faith in
the veracity of its statements.</TE>
<TE>   Current federal law requires only top managers to disclose their
trades in company stock, and it permits them to do so long after the
trade.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosure requirement must be extended to all executives with
substantial stockholdings in a firm. Executives should be required to
reveal on an electronic database accessible to the public any
potential trades 24 hours before they do them. This would enable
investors to compare an executive's personal behavior with the
executive's statements--before the executive is able to profit from
them.</TE>
<TE>   Establishing these necessary reforms, however, would require that
Bush be serious about deterring fraud even at the expense of
executives' huge profits.</TE>
<TE>   He is not.</TE>
<TE>   And so we must gird ourselves for additional problems.</TE>

<HD>Sleeping Giant Decides to Rise and Shine</HD>
<DH>China is moving to challenge the West in economic clout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>I wasn't prepared for China. Not this China. Not the Audis crowding
the roads or the low-slung Ferrari in the hotel valet parking lot. Or
the grand opening of Tiffany's Beijing. Or the gleaming banks--as in
development banks and export banks--along almost every commercial
block. Or the crazy symphonies of perpetually ringing cell phones
everywhere I turned, all personalized to the musical tastes of their
bearers. Or the Olympic-bid spit and polish of the city boulevards
and gardens.</LD>
<LD>   I wasn't prepared to hear people talk about the imposed class
equality of communism with the same kind of past-tense finality that
they express for the imposed class inequality of Imperial rule.</LD>
<LD>   I wasn't prepared for the unstoppable, world-winning confidence
that so many Chinese seem to wear on their sleeves. I wasn't prepared
to see dirty beggars on the sidewalks either.</LD>
<TE>   "We have a saying," a man who uses the Western name of Daniel told
me. "We will have to let some people get rich first so that the rest
of us can follow." Finding a Mao button required a search, really.</TE>
<TE>   I arrived in China for a two-week visit with the standard conceit
of a Westerner. That is, China looms as a "potential market" for us.
I quickly learned a different perspective: China regards the world as
its market. Given its size and determination, China's perspective may
be closer to the coming truth, as Western companies stampede to join
in the country's vehement manufacturing expansion. "The big
question," Jeffrey E. Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management,
observed recently, "is whether the world economy is becoming so
dependent on China as an industrial lifeline that it will soon be
dangerously vulnerable to a major supply disruption....</TE>
<TE>   "In other words," Garten wrote in the June 17 issue of Business
Week, "will China's importance to global manufacturing soon resemble
Saudi Arabia's position in world oil markets?"</TE>
<TE>   Capitalism and free markets bring the promise of not just material
advancement but freedom to the Chinese, or so we tell ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   Not all Westerners swallow the line. In the June issue of Harper's
magazine, writer Barry Lynn suggests that China's looming dominance,
even control, of global industrial production may perversely position
the West as having to support, not challenge, China's ruling elites.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors on official business are advised to bring small,
ceremonial gifts for Chinese officials. The gifts should be made in
our homeland, we're told, and symbolize the region in which we live.
Not an easy task to wander through U.S. gift shops and find
something--anything--that suggests Southern California but is not
made in China or elsewhere abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Some of my travel companions settled on postage stamps, or just
greenbacks folded in envelopes. Not an impressive showing, I'm
afraid.</TE>
<TE>   Undeveloped, developing, developed. That's the journalistic
shorthand by which nations are characterized. China is at least two
of the three. The tallest things around seem to be construction
cranes lifting new skyscrapers higher still above the cities. In
Guangzhou, a mountain park has been used for centuries as a place to
gaze down on the city and the undulating Pearl River. Today you mount
the summit and your eyes are drawn upward to a glass high-rise of
modern China.</TE>
<TE>   People still read newspapers and fliers posted on neighborhood
bulletin boards. But they also throng into bookshops so big as to
swallow up the city-block-size Powell's Bookstore in Portland, Ore.,
the largest in the United States. Prominently displayed are
translations of Western tomes about winning at business and local
authors advising on home decor and entertaining.</TE>
<TE>   My guidebook speaks of "authentic" donkey carts just outside
Beijing on the 50-minute drive to the Great Wall. But since that book
was written, someone has plowed up parts of the countryside and
erected a sprawl of single-family housing tracts that could have been
copied from California.</TE>
<TE>   That's what I wasn't prepared for in this China of today: The
powerful sense of momentum.</TE>
<TE>   In a short time, under limited circumstances, a visitor can
penetrate only the shallowest depths of a complex culture. But
exuberance is a hard thing to miss.</TE>

<HD>Face Terror With Better Spying, Not Moats of Fear</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN MICHAEL JENKINS</AU>
<BD>Brian Michael Jenkins is a senior advisor to the
president of the Rand Corp., a nonprofit policy research and analysis
institution that has been studying terrorism for more than 30 years.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A key goal of terrorists is to undermine confidence in our security,
our economy and ourselves. The most powerful weapon in the terrorist
arsenal is fear.</LD>
<LD>   Certainly, the tighter security imposed throughout the United
States after Sept. 11 is necessary, but no amount of security can
protect us against unbridled fear. We must remember that responding
courageously and intellectually to terrorism is far more effective
than responding fearfully and emotionally.</LD>
<LD>   We need to maintain a realistic sense of the threat that
terrorists pose. Yes, the odds that terrorists will strike someone,
sometime, somewhere in the U.S. are high. But the chances that any
particular individual will be hurt or killed in a terrorist attack
are incredibly small--much lower than the chances of being hurt or
killed in a car accident.</LD>
<TE>   What can we do to reduce the terrorism threat?</TE>
<TE>   An important objective is better intelligence about terrorists so
we can prevent their attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Recent news reports said Congress probably will put off
reorganizing the FBI and CIA to achieve this objective until after it
establishes the proposed Department of Homeland Security. Agencies
that served the nation well in the 20th century need to adapt to the
new reality of combating terrorism in the 21st.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the American public must accept the reality that no
amount of adapting and improving can stop every terrorist
attack--although improvements can certainly stop many attacks,
especially many of the largest and deadliest ones.</TE>
<TE>   Stopping terrorism is enormously difficult because the job of
separating real threats from false alarms is a great challenge.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. receives thousands of intelligence reports from various
sources every day, including numerous threats--few of which
materialize. This is because when not engaged in terrorist
operations, terrorists talk almost endlessly about possible attacks.
Most of the contemplated attacks will never occur outside the
terrorists' own imagination. Add to this the intentional
disinformation spread by terrorists to create alarm and divert
resources.</TE>
<TE>   Inquiries into previous terrorist successes have pointed to the
lack of tactical warning and the requirement for more intelligence
from human sources. The U.S. capacity for technical intelligence is
unsurpassed, but, despite repeated admonitions over the last 18 years
to get more human intelligence, we have found it difficult to do
so--and not because of a recalcitrant intelligence community.</TE>
<TE>   Constraints imposed on domestic intelligence collection have moved
us away from preventive intelligence in favor of prosecution. The
National Commission on Terrorism and others have charged that
restrictions on recruiting informants have greatly weakened our human
intelligence capacity, although the CIA says the restrictions didn't
have a major effect. And no matter how good our human intelligence,
terrorist groups are hard to penetrate. These are small circles of
fanatics, not often motivated by mere greed.</TE>
<TE>   There have not been enough trained professionals and funding for
our intelligence and law enforcement agencies to do all we demand of
them. For example, as the FBI's responsibilities greatly increased in
the last two decades of the 20th century and its agents were
stretched thin, fighting terrorism slipped down the agenda of
priorities.</TE>
<TE>   On top of these difficulties, some argue that the intelligence
community's leadership has become increasingly risk-averse. Others
argue that the political leadership itself has not welcomed
intelligence that would create awkward foreign policy problems.</TE>
<TE>   Congress and the Bush administration will need to look at these
and other issues as they work to respond to terrorism, not with fear
but with effective and intelligent countermeasures.</TE>

<LD>UC Irvine is offering business school students an ethics class that
will try to draw lessons from Enron Corp.'s dramatic and painful
implosion. Good timing. As President Bush said Tuesday in his speech
on corporate responsibility, "America's greatest economic need is
higher ethical standards."</LD>
<LD>   The thinking behind the class titled "The Enron Case" is that
today's headlines will make tomorrow's corporate executives and
accountants more eager to contemplate ethical business practices.</LD>
<LD>   We're not certain that merely offering first-hand accounts from
the likes of Enron whistle-blower Sherron Watkins, a top accountant
and a U.S. attorney will do the trick. Classes in business ethics
surface after every wave of corporate wrongdoing, and a few weeks of
studying Enron won't stop the next generation of executives from
pushing generally accepted accounting principles into the next
county.</LD>
<TE>   Still, our advice to UCI's curriculum planners is to keep the
course top-heavy with "thou shalt nots," including prohibitions on
lying and stealing.</TE>
<TE>   Recruit successful alumni who made their money the old-fashioned
way to tell tomorrow's tycoons and bean counters that after the
current shakeout, the best way to attract savvy shareholders will be
to deliver quality products and services.</TE>
<TE>   Explain the danger of blindly worshiping the quarterly stock price
and warn students against coveting the neighbor's business without
having a clue as to what makes it tick.</TE>
<TE>   The Enron fiasco isn't the first time supposedly smart people have
turned a once-staid business into a carnival house of horrors. The
collapse reminds us of the young savings and loan executive in the
1980s who belittled an old-timer for his "boring, dull, residential
lending." Within a year, the know-it-all, who pushed his S&amp;L into
riskier car loans and junk bond investments, was forced to turn the
key to his failed institution over to the feds.</TE>
<TE>   Schooling alone won't ensure that ethics permeate executive
suites. Only when corporate boards commit to hiring and supporting
executives who espouse ethical behavior will the best aspects of
human nature rise from the mailroom to the boardroom. The class on
Enron should teach that premise but also emphasize the value of
whistle-blowers when corporate boards and executives fall short.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, let's hope the professors at Irvine impress upon their
charges that investors are demanding a sea change when it comes to
corporate responsibility, as reflected in Bush's call Tuesday for
"tough new criminal penalties for corporate fraud."</TE>
<TE>   We encourage Bush and Congress to follow such tough talk with
action, so that the Enron class speakers can honestly assure students
that the bottom line on falsifying revenue or misstating earnings is
not a new mansion in Florida, but jail.</TE>

<HD>Curb the Drug Patent Tricks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Patients suffering from anxiety disorders should have been able to
get an affordable generic equivalent for the brand-name drug BuSpar
when the patent on the drug expired in November 2000. They didn't.
Just hours before the deadline, BuSpar's manufacturer, Bristol-Myers,
filed a "secondary patent," saying beneficial effects come from a
metabolite produced by the patient's body after BuSpar is taken. The
company's ownership claim on the metabolite effectively barred the
release of a generic version of BuSpar that would produce the same
metabolite.</LD>
<LD>   As outlandish as they may be, such bogus claims are common as drug
companies increasingly resort to tricks aimed at delaying generic
competitors.</LD>
<LD>   Congress has a chance to slow the tricksters. Senate Bill 812, by
Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and
scheduled to be considered today in a Senate committee, would make it
tougher for brand-name drug companies to keep generics off the market
beyond the original patent.</LD>
<TE>   Brand-name drug companies have been fighting the measure tooth and
nail. They assert, reasonably, that they are entitled to the law's
full patent protections for genuine innovations. The bill, however,
wouldn't undermine the sort of profit incentive that drove Swiss drug
company Roche and the North Carolina biotech firm Trimeris Inc. to
develop their promising anti-HIV drug T-20, unveiled Monday at an
AIDS summit in Barcelona, Spain.</TE>
<TE>   The bill does not alter the patent code. All it does is help get
generics to market. Firms' ability to collect triple damages for
infringement of legitimate patents would remain.</TE>
<TE>   Generic drug introductions are automatically delayed for 30 months
if a brand-name company files even a trivial patent claim. The
McCain-Schumer bill would require companies to persuade a judge that
their claim had merit before triggering any delay.</TE>
<TE>   Since any wide-ranging prescription drug benefit for Medicare
recipients seems dead for the year, the most that patients can hope
for are actions around the edges, including the McCain-Schumer bill.</TE>
<TE>   Another small step forward comes from pioneering states like
Michigan, which is trying to knock down prices through the leverage
of its state-paid Medicaid program. It has asked drug makers to
submit proposed discounts, or risk being dropped from the program.</TE>
<TE>   Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson approved
Michigan's program in January, but on July 1 the chief drug industry
lobbying group sued Thompson, asking the U.S. District Court to bar
Michigan from implementing the law.</TE>
<TE>   The drug industry must know how bad it looks. If the industry
wants to keep from killing its golden goose, it should embrace the
modest efforts of the Senate and bargain directly with states like
Michigan.</TE>

<LD>Why couldn't they freeze Ted Williams back in the '40s and '50s when
it really would have helped American League pitchers not in Red Sox
uniforms? Now, unfortunately, Williams' family is split in an
emotional legal fight over turning the deceased super-hitter's DNA
into biological memorabilia. The apparent theory of one son, who
isn't known for baseball skills and wasn't alive when Williams
played, is that someone will pay to create a chip off the old block
from the "Splendid Splinter." Is there no refuge from technology
today? Or greed?</LD>
<LD>   The Boston Red Sox, now appallingly part-owned by New Yorkers, can
(as always) use all the help they can get. Remember how they sold
Babe Ruth for $125,000 to the Yankees? Would George Steinbrenner pay
that much for some Ted Williams DNA? And how did all this science
stuff get into the sports pages?</LD>
<LD>   Time was, sports was sports, a refuge for those favoring a final
result daily. There were good guys and bad guys, home teams and the
other guys. Sports had records, injuries, comebacks and at day's end
a final, indisputable score. Today's sports also have police logs,
murder trials, drugs, 10-year incentive-laden contracts and, now,
struggles over body parts.</LD>
<TE>   Williams (he was Teddy on the birth certificate) was not always
popular even in Boston, where boos and cheers might punctuate the
same inning. He sometimes responded by spitting. Here's who Williams
was: a Marine pilot who played baseball. Enough said. He was
competitive--on the field, where he broke numerous records, and in
the sky, where he invested five years fighting for his country in two
wars and twice lost to opposing MIGs.</TE>
<TE>   Like fellow Californian Joe DiMaggio, Williams hated losing. When
his 1941 manager offered him the chance to ride the bench and
preserve a .400 season batting average, Williams refused. He finished
at .406. The record stands. After a subpar .254 season in 1959,
Williams demanded a 28% pay cut for his final year. That's right, a
pay cut.  Another record unthreatened in an era of Enron and Global
Crossing. Williams' last at-bat: home run No. 521. Just last night,
his name went on the All-Star MVP award.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a plan: Cremate the Hall of Famer as he requested, mixing
the ashes with those of his beloved Dalmatian, Slugger, and
sprinkling them over the Florida Keys where they went fishing and
often struck out. But let's save a pinch of ash to mix into the next
batch of green paint that goes up on that left-field wall in Fenway
Park. Dead or alive, Williams owns the place anyway.</TE>

<LD>Well, why stop with a giant American flag on Conejo Peak ("Retiree
Leads Campaign for a Mountain of a Flag," July 4)? Surely the folks
in Yosemite wouldn't mind one atop El Capitan, or floodlit at night
next to Yosemite Falls; and with that success, we could put a
500-foot flagpole on Mt. Whitney, with a flag that would be visible
from Lone Pine.</LD>
<LD>   The ultimate, of course, would be a 600-story flagpole in the
Grand Canyon, guyed from Bright Angel, Desert View and the North Rim.
We could put up a flag quilted from squares sewn by representatives
from all the states, all of the Native American tribes and several
chambers of commerce. If a flag is ever installed on Conejo Peak I'll
be in tears, all right, but not from patriotism.</LD>

<TE>   Increasingly, it seems we value the symbols of America more than
America itself: First the Pledge of Allegiance furor, now a
well-meaning but misguided patriot like Sonny Suarez. Our "purple
mountains' majesty" should not be dominated by gargantuan flags
bathed in artificial light but appreciated for what they are: natural
beauties preserved by man, a national treasure--from sea to shining
sea.</TE>

<TE>   Well, isn't that sweet: Suarez will be in tears when he sees his
flag on the mountain ridge. How about the thousands of people who
would rather see the skyline of a beautiful, natural mountain
uncluttered with anything? If the flag triggers such an emotional
response in Suarez perhaps he could paint flags on the walls of his
rooms.</TE>
<TE>   And who does this guy think he is to call anyone who disagrees
with him misguided or unpatriotic? He should be careful, lest someone
call him an obsessed zealot.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "In Iraq, U.S. Faces New Dynamics," July 6: If we're going to
invade Iraq, we should go straight to the endgame and burn the Iraqi
oil fields. If we don't, they will. Every possible outcome of an
invasion includes those oil fields being lost. If we want to take
away Iraq's ability to develop weapons of mass destruction, then take
away the oil. It is the source of Iraq's money and the only reason
any outsider cares about that poor, dark place.</LD>
<LD>   Burn the oil and Iraq will fade back into a medieval culture. It
saves putting our troops in danger and saves the expense of an
invasion and occupation.</LD>
<LD>   Clint Everett</LD>
<TE>   San Diego</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In your article on Iraq you write that a military analyst says
that "public discussion of plans for invading Iraq makes their actual
execution less likely." Indeed, Iraq's military now has a road map of
the invasion plans courtesy of the Bush administration. And there has
yet to be spirited public debate about these plans among Democratic
and Republican members of Congress, let alone the American public.
Does not Congress have sole constitutional power to declare war? I
suggest the Bush administration publicly announce that it is
withdrawing its Iraq war plans.</TE>

<HD>Distribute the Costs of Pollution Cleanup</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Times editorializes in favor of again taxing
corporations--instead of society at large--for the remaining cleanup
of Superfund sites ("Bring Back Superfund Tax," editorial, July 2).
While the National Assn. of Manufacturers carries no water for
polluters, we do stick up for companies that, despite doing the right
thing again and again, are maligned by ill-informed media critics and
politicians goaded by environmental groups. Sen. Barbara Boxer's
(D-Calif.) proposed renewal of corporate Superfund taxes would
squeeze more than a billion dollars a year from our already
beleaguered industrial sector--including general manufacturers. Where
do the senator and The Times think this money will ultimately come
from?</LD>
<LD>   American businesses have spent tens of billions of dollars
cleaning up Superfund sites since the 1980s and will continue to do
so. But because eager consumers, as well as producers, share in
creating pollution, it's not unreasonable to suggest at this point
that costs for further pollution reductions be shared by all who will
benefit. Singling out our industrial sector for a massive tax
increase just as it's struggling to recover from recession and
restore 1.6 million lost jobs would do significant harm to our
economy and capacity to make future environmental improvements.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With all the hoop-la (pun intended) being made about the basketball
movie "Like Mike," there was a striking irony that stood out in your
article, "NBA and Hollywood Hoping Kids 'Like Mike' Enough to Become
Fans" (July 3). The movie's primary scene portrays the young main
character gaining extraordinary athletic powers through an extremely
dangerous and deadly stunt--climbing a tree (in the rain) and
grasping a pair of athletic shoes tangled in an energized power line.</LD>
<LD>   Since it is too late to alter the film, we encourage the producers
to do the socially responsible thing by adding a safety message or
disclaimer in their advertising, promotional interviews and in the
video version of an otherwise entertaining movie.</LD>
<LD>   While we all recognize that "Like Mike" is pure fantasy, we've
seen too many copycat instances where bizarre acts in movies have
inspired bizarre behavior by impressionable youth, with harmful
consequences. Be it a kite, toy or even athletic shoes tangled in
power lines, we continue to warn everyone: "Don't be like Mike, stay
away from power lines." It's a serious matter of life and death.</LD>

<HD>Better Security Against Attacks at Our Airports</HD>

<LD>Re "Airport Security Stakes Rising," July 7: As a traveler and
investor in the Philippines (until my wife and I were kidnapped there
in September 1997), I was always amazed at the rigorous security
measures imposed at Ninoy Aquino International Airport, while
security at Los Angeles International Airport--a much more inviting
target--was so, well, "lax."</LD>
<LD>   To leave NAIA, you had to pass through at least eight, and
sometimes nine, checkpoints with a combination of armed guards and
security personnel X-raying and opening your bags, patting you down
and keeping an eye on people who acted suspiciously. There were no
"bon voyage" visitors allowed in the terminals; only ticketed
passengers were allowed beyond the street entrance.</LD>
<LD>   These measures were initiated by the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration, which told Philippine Airlines officials that if they
wanted landing privileges in the U.S. they had to get serious about
security.</LD>
<TE>   Although at first it was quite annoying and degrading, it turns
out that Ramzi Yousef and his fellow terrorists were planning on
blowing up as many as a dozen Manila-based international flights over
the Pacific Ocean. So while the heightened security was aggravating,
it clearly had a deterrent effect.</TE>
<TE>   Today, millions of passengers depart from NAIA each year, and I
haven't read or heard about any terrorist incident there in the last
seven years. Perhaps if we'd adopted our own security measures we
wouldn't have had a tragedy at El Al last Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen P. Watkins</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The two recent murders at LAX would have been many more in number
had not an armed El Al employee acted quickly. The Egyptian immigrant
Hesham Mohamed Hadayet was equipped with much ammunition to load and
reload his weapon.</TE>
<TE>   We would all be much safer if there were more responsible and
trained private citizens carrying concealed arms. (Airline pilots are
one group that should always be armed.) Of course, this flies in the
face of the hysterical anti-gun nuts who have been shrieking in our
faces for decades. They are wrong and they need to be shouted down.</TE>
<TE>   John K. Carter</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the Fourth of July attack on El Al's LAX
ticket counter, if the FBI can't recognize a terrorist attack even
after it has happened, how can we trust it to recognize terrorist
attacks that are still only in the planning stages?</TE>
<TE>   Lorin Fife</TE>
<TE>   Valley Village</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Airport security has improved over the last year, with a generally
acceptable amount of inconvenience. We still have things we can do
better.</TE>
<TE>   When I pick up arriving passengers at the airport, it is no longer
practical to leave my car in short-term parking because of the added
security checks. Rather, I typically drive slowly around until I see
my friends at the curb. When I stop at the curb, I expect constant
police reminders making sure I don't park in the loading zone or
leave my vehicle unattended.</TE>
<TE>   A great improvement would be a scoreboard-type display of the
status of arriving flights, visible to drivers. Airline schedules are
less than perfect, and it would be nice to know when a flight has
been delayed or when it has been on the ground long enough for all
passengers to have claimed their bags.</TE>

<HD>Arson Penalty Should  Be a Strong Deterrent</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like most others, I have been dismayed and horrified by the fires
that have ravaged the West, especially when it developed that the two
most serious fires, in Colorado and Arizona, were allegedly started
by arsonists. Fires, whether they are in cities or in forests,
jeopardize the lives of both civilians and firefighters as well as
untold numbers of animals.</LD>
<LD>   They destroy buildings and national forests that cost us all
thousands of dollars in rebuilding--or are essentially unreplaceable.
The crime of arson is so serious that I would like to see the federal
government make arson--no matter where it occurs, in a city or in the
country--a crime that has a mandatory life sentence without parole.
And let that time be served in a maximum security prison.</LD>
<LD>   The fact that arson can be so easily done in the dead of night off
a lonely stretch of highway and, in the mind of the perpetrator, is a
crime that he or she might pretty well assume will go unsolved, is a
very good reason to make the punishment so severe that it will act as
a deterrent to anyone contemplating such an act.</LD>

<HD>$3.35-Billion School Bond Hits Ballot</HD>
<DH>Education: L.A. Unified trustees think big in unanimously
asking voters to 'show their support' by funding an ambitious set of
goals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Board of Education voted unanimously Tuesday to place
a $3.35-billion school construction bond on the November ballot,
setting the stage for a high-stakes campaign to win the electorate's
approval.</LD>
<LD>   School officials say the money would fund 120 new schools, expand
79 existing campuses, cease most busing programs and remove portable
classrooms from playgrounds across the district. If the bond passes
Nov. 5, each property owner in the Los Angeles Unified School
District will pay additional taxes of $60 per every $100,000 of
assessed value every year for 25 years.</LD>
<LD>   After Tuesday's vote, schools Supt. Roy Romer declared: "It's a
great day. Now we can go to the public and say, 'This is what we're
going to do. We have a clear and very precise plan on how we're going
to spend this money.' "</LD>
<TE>   The vote followed a succession of speakers who supported the
construction bond, including community activist Constance Rice, who
was one of the most outspoken critics of how the district managed the
$2.4 billion from Proposition BB, which voters passed in 1997 to
repair and build schools.</TE>
<TE>   "During the last bond the district didn't have the professional
staff to pull this off. They didn't have the information; there was
no facilities staff up to the job," Rice said. But L.A. Unified's
ability to recently submit applications for nearly $1 billion in
state funds for school construction within 18 months has proved to
her that the "district is ready for prime time."</TE>
<TE>   With the board's vote, the measure, which will require 55%
approval, will be added to the fall ballot, which is already crowded
with proposals for San Fernando Valley secession and a $13-billion
state school construction bond. Two parallel bond campaigns--one a
district-funded, nonpartisan informational campaign, the other a
privately funded political campaign-- are already underway.</TE>
<TE>   At the last minute, board members unanimously approved a proposal
by trustee David Tokofsky to increase the bond issue by $50 million
to fund early childhood education centers, bringing the total for
that purpose to $80 million.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really momentous," said board President Caprice Young.
"I've said for a long time that the people of Los Angeles care about
their schools, and in November they'll have an opportunity to show
their support."</TE>
<TE>   In other matters, the board awarded a $2.9-million contract to
fund environmental studies and engineering designs for the half-built
Belmont Learning Complex.</TE>
<TE>   After spending $154 million, the district abandoned the downtown
high school more than two years ago because of concerns about methane
and other hazardous gases discovered underneath the site. The school
board, persuaded that the school could be made safe, later revived
the project.</TE>
<TE>   A team led by a group of Latino activists and Matt Construction is
charged with completing the environmental reviews within six months.
If the site passes muster, work could begin by year's end.</TE>

<HD>Padilla Has Alternative to Breakup, Boroughs</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>City Council President Alex Padilla, who opposes putting a measure to
create a borough system for Los Angeles on the November ballot, said
he will offer a competing plan at a meeting of the council's rules
committee today.</LD>
<LD>   Padilla's proposal would establish a commission to investigate
ways to improve the governmental structure of Los Angeles. The
commission would not be required to develop a plan to divide the city
into boroughs, or to necessarily recommend changing the way the city
is run.</LD>
<LD>   Padilla said he will offer his plan as an alternative to a
proposal by Councilwomen Wendy Greuel and Janice Hahn that would
allow voters to decide whether to decentralize Los Angeles government
by dividing the city into boroughs.</LD>
<TE>   The Greuel-Hahn plan is intended as an alternative to breaking up
the city. Proposals to create separate cities in the San Fernando
Valley and in Hollywood are bound for voters this fall.</TE>
<TE>   But Padilla, a secession opponent, said Tuesday that he thinks the
city should not rush into a new form of government just to defeat a
breakup. And he said he does not believe that it is politically
necessary to offer voters an alternative to secession.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we need to manipulate or confuse the voters,"
Padilla said. "We will defeat secession on the merits."</TE>
<TE>   Both plans will be heard by the rules committee at today's
meeting.</TE>

<HD>E. Brown, 75: Avant-Garde Composer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Earle Brown, who was a member of the New York School of composers in
the 1950s and among the first to think of music as being as formally
free as the action paintings of Jackson Pollock and as flexible as a
kinetic sculpture by Alexander Calder, died July 2 at his home in
Nyack, N.Y. He was 75 and died of cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Brown first came to attention in 1952, when he was invited by John
Cage to be a regular part of his circle, which included other young
composers Morton Feldman and Christian Wolff and pianist David Tudor.
Brown's first wife, Carolyn, was a founding member of the Cunningham
Dance Company in 1953. As a couple, they were active in the Greenwich
Village social scene that included the Abstract Expressionist
painters, New York School poets and members of the Living Theater.</LD>
<LD>   With a background in jazz and engineering, Earle Brown was an
early innovator in graphic notation. In "December 1952," one of a
series of works from 1952-53 grouped together as "Folio I," he became
the first modern composer to attempt a score that eschewed musical
notation altogether.</LD>
<TE>   Looking more like a sketch for a Mondrian painting than a musical
composition, 31 horizontal and vertical bars of varying length and
thickness float in space. It is up to the performer or performers to
decide what instrument or instruments will be used and to figure out
a way to associate the graphic scheme with pitches and rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   When played as a solo piano piece by Tudor, "December 1952" had an
ethereal, floating quality that proved surprisingly seductive. It
influenced the subsequent graphic scores of Cage and Feldman, as well
as those by such European avant-garde composers as Karlheinz
Stockhausen, Pierre Boulez and Bruno Maderna, who were also seeking
to free their music from formal constraints. And although it was
Brown's most radical work, it did set him on the path of exploring
what he came to call "open form" music that could be a parallel to
the kind of work he admired in the other arts.</TE>
<TE>   "What made me write music the way I wrote it," he said in 1986,
"and still write, is more connected to my experiences as a young
artist, influenced by Kenneth Patchen's poetry and James Joyce and
Gertrude Stein and the Abstract Expressionist painters and
sculptors." Pollock's paintings, he also said, looked as he wanted
his music to sound.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Lunenburg, Mass., Earle Appleton Brown was drawn to
aerodynamics from an early age, an interest that led not only to his
enrollment at Northeastern University in 1944 to study engineering
and mathematics, but also to his lifelong love of fast cars. The next
year he enlisted in the Army Air Corps, in which he received his
pilot's license and played trumpet in the Air Corps Orchestra. After
his discharge in 1947, he spent three years in Boston studying jazz
trumpet and 12-tone writing, also becoming a disciple of Joseph
Schillinger's mathematical approach to composition.</TE>
<TE>   In 1950, Brown married Carolyn Rice, and they moved to Denver,
where he taught the Schillinger method. The next year Cage and Merce
Cunningham came through, and the Browns immediately hit it off with
them. Cage suggested that Earle work with him in New York, and
Cunningham invited Carolyn to take his dance classes.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving in New York a year later, the young composer immediately
joined Cage on his Project for Music and Magnetic Tape. For six
months Brown and Cage sat at the same table splicing tape to create
electronic music compositions.</TE>
<TE>   Brown would later parlay this experience into a job as a recording
engineer at Capitol Records from 1955 to 1960 and work at
Mainstream-Time Records, where over the next dozen years he produced
a series of long-playing records that helped document the
experimental music scene. He also commissioned paintings for the
jacket covers by such emerging artists as Yoko Ono.</TE>
<TE>   In Brown's music during the 1950s he continually refined his
methods, trying to achieve a balance between his compositional
control of the material and a sense of freedom in performance.</TE>
<TE>   In one of his finest pieces, "Available Forms," he produced an
open-form score in which performers played written-out material but
the conductor decided during performance when they would play.</TE>
<TE>   In 1964, Brown created "Available Forms II" for the New York
Philharmonic and two conductors, himself and Leonard Bernstein. In
these pieces, the composer joined his instincts as an improvising
jazz musician with an engineer's penchant for precision and his
passion for artistic adventure into genuinely distinctive music.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, Brown had collaborated with the creators of the visual
art that he admired most. For the percussion quartet, "Calder Piece,"
he asked the sculptor to build a mobile, "Chef d'Orchestre," which
would be a sort of conductor, its movements indicating for the
percussionist what and when to play. Delighted to make a sculpture
for this purpose, Calder told the composer, "You can't just go around
banging on someone else's mobile."</TE>
<TE>   Brown composed steadily but slowly during the remaining decades of
his life, ever further refining his approach to open forms. His first
marriage having ended in divorce, he wed Susan Sollins, an art
curator, in 1972. He taught regularly around the world, including a
stint as a composer in residence at the California Institute of the
Arts from 1973 to 1985. From 1984 to 1989, he served as director of
the Fromm Music Foundation at Harvard University and of the Fromm
Weeks of New Music at Aspen, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Brown's late pieces did not have the impact of his earlier works,
as the composer had become somewhat marginalized by the new music
scene. But he never lost his large following in Europe, especially
Germany. After the deaths of Feldman in 1988, Cage in 1992 and Tudor
in 1996, Brown was much in demand for panels and guest appearances as
one of the two remaining members of the New York School, along with
Wolff.</TE>
<TE>   But in such late pieces as "Tracking Pierrot" for chamber ensemble
and "Summer Suite '95" for piano, Brown achieved a consolidation of
his jazz roots with his experimental practice that generated a new
lyrical impulse. "I certainly have never been embarrassed by writing
a beautiful melody, a very lyrical passage or what I consider a
beautiful chord progression," he said in 1995. Even so, he never lost
his collaborative spirit in wanting his music to soar as it could
only through an interaction between composer and performers.</TE>
<TE>   Among Brown's honors were a Guggenheim Fellowship, an honorary
doctorate from the Peabody Conservatory and a "Letter of Distinction"
from the American Music Center.</TE>

<HD>Burning Car Ignites a New Brush Fire in Santa Clarita</HD>
<DH>Safety: The blaze, about 70% contained by evening, blackens
roughly 60 acres and threatens homes. Two freeway lanes are closed.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second day in a row, a brush fire Tuesday threatened homes in
Santa Clarita and caused traffic backups on a local freeway.</LD>
<LD>   Flames were moving toward homes near Calgrove Boulevard and La
Salle Canyon Drive about an hour after a car fire on the Golden State
Freeway sparked the blaze about 4 p.m., authorities said. More than
60 acres of hilly terrain had burned by 7:30 p.m., with the fire
about 70% contained, Los Angeles County fire officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Although flames came close, no homes were damaged as
water-dropping helicopters and about 400 firefighters battled the
blaze, fire officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Four firefighters suffered heat exhaustion, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden State Freeway remained open, but two of the four
northbound lanes were closed beginning at Weldon Canyon Road, about
five miles south of Calgrove Boulevard, said California Highway
Patrol Officer Vince Ramirez.</TE>
<TE>   An evacuation center was set up at Wiley Canyon Elementary School
in Newhall.</TE>
<TE>   County officials said firefighters were getting the upper hand on
the blaze by early evening.</TE>
<TE>   "Luckily the weather was cooperating with us and that allowed the
fire to burn slowly and allowed us to save the 100 homes in the path
of the fire," said Los Angeles County Fire Department Inspector Ed
Osorio.</TE>
<TE>   The flames burned within 30 to 100 yards of most of the homes on
La Salle Canyon Drive--many of them half-million dollar residences on
acre lots. Homeowners said they were grateful for the prompt response
from firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   "Essentially, behind every house they had a firefighter with a
hose at the ready," said Dennis Kuba, 52, a Disney executive. "The
firefighter at my house was wetting everything down--the trees and
the house--with foam and water."</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Joan Kuba, added: "They are certainly heroes. I thought
so before, but now they are my personal heroes."</TE>
<TE>   A day earlier, a separate brush fire heavily damaged one home,
threatened at least 200 others in Santa Clarita and caused the
temporary shutdown of the Antelope Valley Freeway during the
afternoon rush hour.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of Monday's fire, which started about 12:30 p.m. at San
Fernando Road and the Antelope Valley Freeway and burned 250 acres,
remained unknown, fire officials said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 400 firefighters from Los Angeles County, the U.S.
Forest Service and other agencies fought the blaze, which closed the
Antelope Valley Freeway for much of Monday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   One firefighter suffered a twisted ankle and four others had heat
exhaustion.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze, pushed by strong winds, heavily damaged the
three-bedroom home that Mike Zeballos, 32, shares with his fiancee,
Lorena Acevedo, 30.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the home in the 19600 block of Crystal Spring
Court caught fire after flying embers landed on its wood shake roof
and quickly consumed the home.</TE>
<TE>   When Zeballos and Acevedo--stuck in traffic on the Antelope Valley
Freeway--arrived at the house about 7 p.m., the roof had already
collapsed and most of their belongings were soaked and darkened by
smoke and ash.</TE>
<TE>   "We bought this house as a fixer-upper," said Zeballos, who moved
into the Golden Valley neighborhood about a year ago. "We were
planning to do a lot of work on the house, but we just did not have
time."</TE>
<TE>   Acevedo, still visibly shaken, said, "The roof was the first thing
we wanted to work on."</TE>
<TE>   The couple plan to get married Friday, but had no immediate plans
regarding the house. Fortunately, Zeballos said, no one was injured
and their dogs were safe.</TE>
<TE>   Residents and fire officials warned that wooden roofs can be
dangerous, especially in areas where fires are frequent.</TE>
<TE>   The wood shake roof on Kathy Bell's house also caught fire from
the flying embers. That fire was quickly extinguished by a sprinkler
system on her roof and firefighters who were already in the Golden
Valley neighborhood extinguishing flames.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to hug those firefighters," said 52-year-old Bell, who
started calling for estimates for a new roof on Tuesday morning.
"They saved my house."</TE>
<TE>   As she threw out handful after handful of scorched geraniums
Tuesday morning, Pam Grisaffi, 46, said she was saddened by her
neighbors' losses but believes the latest fire will prepare the
neighborhood for the future.</TE>
<TE>   "This was too close," said Grisaffi, who has lived in the area for
18 years. "Most people who live in this area have seen or heard of
fires jumping the freeway, but they are always stopped before they
get to the homes. Well, now we know that it can happen, and we have
to be ready."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Andrew Blankstein, Wendy Thermos and David
Pierson contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Budget Stalemate Faces Fresh Complications</HD>
<DH>Government: Advocates protest proposed cuts in funding for
tobacco prevention as Assembly bickers over how to close a
$23.6-billion shortfall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>As California's budget stalemate drags into a second week, the delay
is causing state officials to confront a new complication: interest
groups trying to fiddle with the spending package.</LD>
<LD>   A coalition of health advocates launched a radio campaign Tuesday
that takes issue with Gov. Gray Davis and the Legislature for
slashing tobacco-prevention funding, raiding future tobacco-related
money and trying to pass a licensing bill that opponents contend will
benefit the tobacco industry.</LD>
<LD>   While temperatures were expected to hit 105 degrees here Tuesday,
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) experienced
a meltdown with the mercury hovering only in the 90s. He showed up at
the group's news conference and accused one of its organizers of
lying about the tobacco-licensing bill.</LD>
<TE>   "You're so dumb," Peace later told a woman from the American Heart
Assn. "You can't fix dumb."</TE>
<TE>   The exchange came as the new fiscal year entered its ninth day
without a budget, with Assembly Republicans and Democrats at odds
over $4 billion in new taxes and revenue to help close a
$23.6-billion shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Party leaders met Tuesday without reaching agreement on the
package, which could be considered again Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Tuesday, another health-care group released survey results
contending that Californians favor tax hikes to avoid deep cuts to
medical services for the poor or disabled. It also found that the
public favors taxing the rich over a plan sought by Davis to hike
vehicle-license fees to raise money, the group said.</TE>
<TE>   The spending package has already cleared the Senate, so any
changes would need to be approved by its members, most of whom have
left for a monthlong break and are not expected back at the Capitol
until Aug. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, advocates said Tuesday that they believe it's
important to inject the voters' views into the ongoing budget debate.</TE>
<TE>   "I do still hope our survey can influence the process," said Dr.
Mark Smith, president of the California HealthCare Foundation, which
commissioned the budget survey. "But even if it doesn't affect this
budget, we hope it will influence thinking when these questions come
up again next year."</TE>
<TE>   More fallout from the delay will materialize Friday when several
hundred legislative employees will miss their first paycheck if a new
budget is not in place, said state Controller Kathleen Connell.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers and the rest of the state's 250,000 employees won't be
at risk until the end of the month, when their next paychecks are
due. A California Supreme Court decision on a budget-related lawsuit
could force Connell to pay most state employees only the federal
minimum wage.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Connell said, she has received few complaints from vendors
who do business with the state, but she suggested that is because the
Davis administration has instructed state agencies to wait until the
budget is signed before forwarding the bills to her office. Because
the state recently borrowed $7.5 billion, Connell said she does not
expect any cash-flow problems through September.</TE>
<TE>   With a cash crisis averted, state officials turned their attention
to fending off an image crisis. The American Cancer Society joined
the American Heart and American Lung associations in airing a radio
spot in Sacramento that warned Californians they can either choose to
lead the nation in saving lives from tobacco or fall behind and allow
their children to pay the price.</TE>
<TE>   The groups want Davis and lawmakers to earmark 15 cents of a
proposed 63-cent hike in state excise taxes on each pack of
cigarettes to prevention programs. The Davis administration contends
the tax hike would reduce smoking by making it more expensive.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed budget relies on $650 million from the cigarette tax
hike and borrows $4.5 billion against the state's future share of the
national tobacco settlement, meaning that the state would rely on
tobacco-related money to solve more than one-fifth of its
$23.6-billion shortfall.</TE>

<HD>Evidence Coerced, Attorney Says</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Defense wants charges dropped for a Ventura woman
who told officers about a slaying but later was implicated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An attorney for murder suspect Bridget Callahan set out Tuesday to
prove that law enforcement officials violated her rights so severely
that charges against her should be dismissed.</LD>
<LD>   Callahan, a 30-year-old Ventura resident, is charged with one
count of first-degree murder for allegedly helping two skinhead gang
members kill a teenage girl in October 1998.</LD>
<LD>   State prosecutors began presenting evidence to support the charge
Tuesday during a preliminary hearing in Ventura County Superior
Court. But Callahan is not the only person under scrutiny in the
case.</LD>
<TE>   Oxnard defense lawyer Joseph O'Neill contends that an investigator
and a prosecutor with the Ventura County district attorney's office,
as well as detectives with the Ventura County Sheriff's Department,
coerced and deceived Callahan in order to obtain information
concerning the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   In his opening statement, O'Neill said evidence to be presented at
the hearing will focus not only on the killing of 17-year-old Nichole
Hendrix of Ventura, but also on the actions of law enforcement
officers involved in the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   But state Deputy Atty. Gen. Michael Katz, whose agency took over
the case at the request of county prosecutors, told Judge Vincent J.
O'Neill Jr. that the defense theories of misconduct will not hold up.</TE>
<TE>   "When we are done with it, I'll be back up here talking about the
evidence that her statement was voluntary," Katz said.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be a spectacle," he said of the hearing, which is
expected to last up to two weeks. "But there will be no evidence to
support the conspiracy theory."</TE>
<TE>   Callahan is accused of standing guard while skinheads David
Ziesmer, 29, and Michael Bridgeford, 25, stabbed, kicked and beat
Hendrix to death in a motel bathroom Oct. 15, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   According to Tuesday's testimony, Hendrix was reported missing
around that date and her partial skeletal remains--a skull and a few
bones--were found six months later in a ravine near Pine Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy revealed that Hendrix sustained blows to the face,
including a possible stab wound near an eye, Sheriff's Sgt. Michael
Powers testified.</TE>
<TE>   Duct tape, bed linens and a trash bin were also found at the
scene, prompting the coroner to rule the death a homicide, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about his initial contact with Callahan, Powers testified
that he helped move her from Arizona to New Mexico after she entered
an agreement with the district attorney in December 1999 to provide
information about the case.</TE>
<TE>   Powers said the move cost about $3,000, which came out of the
district attorney's budget.</TE>
<TE>   Powers went on to become the lead detective in the Hendrix
homicide case.</TE>
<TE>   He testified that no threats or promises were made to Callahan to
induce her statements about the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   On cross-examination, Powers acknowledged that he knew authorities
had intended to arrest Callahan despite her assistance as an
informant and that she believed she was a witness--not a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   "She was of the belief that she had an agreement with law
enforcement, isn't that right?" attorney O'Neill asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Powers said, admitting that he purposefully did not correct
her misconceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "She made the agreement with the district attorney's office--not
Mike Powers, not the Sheriff's Department," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony is scheduled to resume this morning before Judge
O'Neill, who is not related to the defense attorney Joseph O'Neill.</TE>

<HD>At UC Language Institutes, It's Live and Learn</HD>
<DH>Santa Barbara program houses students, professors together

<LD>Fluent in Spanish, French, Russian and English, Luz Forero
understands a thing or two about learning foreign tongues.</LD>
<LD>   But Forero's savoir-faire fell short when it came to finding a way
to pursue her studies on the graduate level. As a busy mother of two
young children and as the assistant director of the language
laboratory at Occidental College, how could she squeeze a master's
degree program into her schedule?</LD>
<LD>   The answer for Forero, as well as for dozens of others pinched for
time, has been one of the specialized summer language and culture
institutes at UC Santa Barbara. The school, with its Spanish and
French institutes, is one of only a handful of universities offering
master's degree language programs for summer-only students.</LD>
<TE>   Its students--mainly high school teachers and other educators--do
their studies without leaving American soil. The programs consist of
six-week sessions taken over three summers.</TE>
<TE>   Though shorter than conventional master's degree programs, the
institutes try to make up for it with round-the-clock language
immersion.</TE>
<TE>   All students are expected to abide by a written pledge (sometimes
called la promesa in Spanish or declaration sur l'honneur in French)
to speak only Spanish or French whenever possible. Students must be
capable Spanish or French speakers to be admitted, but their fluency
is sharpened over the three summers.</TE>
<TE>   The students and their professors live as neighbors throughout the
summer in a university-owned apartment complex, and they have lunch
together every weekday in the faculty club.</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Jacques Thomas, a professor from Duke University who has
directed the UC Santa Barbara French institute every summer since
1990, says the main benefit for students is the contact they have
with faculty. "They see me doing my laundry and can come ask me a
question," Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   Arturo Giraldez, director of the Spanish institute and a professor
at University of the Pacific, recalls a time when he stepped outside
his apartment at 4 a.m. and bumped into a student. He wound up
answering questions about the Spanish subjunctive in the predawn
hours.</TE>
<TE>   Students "try to squeeze you for all you're worth," Giraldez said
with a soft laugh. "That's the point. Without that, what's the point
of living together?"</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the barbecues and cultural events scheduled by the
institutes, there isn't a lot of time for socializing.</TE>
<TE>   "Every minute I can, I need to be writing as much as I can," said
Forero, 41, now in her last year at the Spanish institute and busy
writing her thesis.</TE>
<TE>   The institutes, though well-respected, aren't the biggest names in
their corner of academia. The school that for years has dominated
graduate and undergraduate summer language study is Vermont's
Middlebury College, which this summer is providing about 1,250
students with instruction in eight languages.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Katz, Middlebury's dean of language schools and schools
abroad, said the language immersion on his campus is even more
tightly maintained than at UC Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   His faculty and students eat together a full three times a day.
Also, Middlebury students, unlike their counterparts at Santa
Barbara, aren't allowed to bring their families--to remove the
temptation to speak English.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald W. Tobin, who as chairman of the French department helped
launch the first summer language institute at UC Santa Barbara in
1977, countered that his campus' institutes maintain higher standards
than Middlebury by focusing exclusively on graduate studies.</TE>
<TE>   He said some of the first professors at the Santa Barbara French
institute had left Middlebury because of concerns the undergraduate
program there would "dilute the quality" of graduate studies.</TE>
<TE>   "We have never been tempted to include undergraduates here, for
precisely that reason," said Tobin, now an associate vice chancellor.</TE>
<TE>   'Artificial Immersion'</TE>
<TE>   At both schools, however, administrators agree that their
"artificial immersion" approaches to language learning can offer
advantages over the "authentic immersion" of living in a foreign
country.</TE>
<TE>   Living abroad "has all sorts of diversions," Katz said. "You can
get the International Herald Tribune and you can tune in CNN, and you
can go to English bars and speak English as much as you want and hang
out with other Americans."</TE>
<TE>   The institutes' enrollments ebb and flow with the popularity of
the languages they offer.</TE>
<TE>   As interest in Spanish has surged at colleges around the country,
UC Santa Barbara's Spanish institute--formally known as the Summer
Institute in Hispanic Languages and Culture--is enjoying a record
enrollment of 44 this summer. But the French program, the Summer
Institute of French and Francophone Studies, has only 22 students.
That is down from its peak enrollment of about 35 during the 1990s. A
German program was scrapped in the late 1990s for lack of interest.</TE>
<TE>   For the high school teachers at the institute, who normally pay
their own way to attend, earning a master's degree can have a quick
payoff. Typically, they will receive automatic raises of $2,000 or
more and will increase their chances of winning promotions.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many say they are attending mostly because they want to
reconnect with the intellectual discipline that brought them into
education. And some don't have other convenient options for graduate
work.</TE>
<TE>   Jayne Abrate, the Carbondale, Ill.,-based executive director of
the American Assn. of Teachers of French, said the lack of part-time
master's programs "has often been a concern among French teachers who
aren't near large metropolitan areas. They would love to get a
master's in French, but they can't."</TE>
<TE>   Gary Hayman, a San Bernardino high school teacher with a master's
in German, came to Santa Barbara to strengthen his French. Hayman's
school phased out German a year ago and now is relying on him to
teach French, a language he doesn't know as well.</TE>
<TE>   Hayman, 48, said he was "blown away" by the sophistication of the
French discussion in class when he started at the institute last
week.</TE>
<TE>   The students' enthusiasm for Spanish and French studies is evident
in the classroom. Antonio Cortijo, a UC Santa Barbara professor who
has taught in the summer Spanish institute for four years, said his
summer classes sometimes run beyond the scheduled time. No one
interrupts to let him know.</TE>
<TE>   During the regular school year, "people would have been packing
up," he said. "With this class, they would stay here as long as I
talk."</TE>
<TE>   That sort of dedication, along with the pleasures of spending
summer in Santa Barbara, helps attract the visiting professors who
make up the majority of the summer faculty.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like being in paradise. I can't believe they pay me to be
here," said Mercedes F. Duran-Cogan, a researcher from Simon Fraser
University near Vancouver, Canada, who is teaching at the Spanish
institute.</TE>

<HD>Deficits Threaten Doctors' Training</HD>
<DH>County: As the health department faces cuts, medical
schools fear loss of funding for hospital residencies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major health-care cuts in Los Angeles County are likely to upend
medical education programs locally and reduce the number of physician
faculty members and medical residents who train at county hospitals,
officials say.</LD>
<LD>   Medical schools are confronting this bleak reality as county
health officials try to eliminate a budget deficit that could reach
$800 million in three years.</LD>
<LD>   Though details of the cutbacks are still being worked out, "the
bottom line is that there will be fewer medical residency positions
for the students finishing medical school in Southern California,"
said Dr. Charles K. Francis, president of Charles R. Drew University
of Medicine and Science. Drew trains many minority doctors at Martin
Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center in Willowbrook.</LD>
<TE>   Fewer slots for residents, or physicians in training, could lead
to fewer physicians practicing in the region, Francis and others say.</TE>
<TE>   "The level of health care that's practiced in the city has a lot
to do with the quality of the training that's taking place in the
residency programs and the medical schools," said Dr. Lawrence Stock,
a clinical faculty member at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center near
Torrance. "People tend to stay where they're trained."</TE>
<TE>   The prospect leaves many young doctors nervous.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to put it far in the back of my mind, but it's there," said
Dr. Melanie Midget, a third-year psychiatry resident at King/Drew's
Augustus Hawkins mental health clinic. "You're trying to finish your
residency, your education, and then there's the thought that my
program may close. Where am I going to go?"</TE>
<TE>   County health officials don't dispute the harm that could be
caused by medical education cutbacks, but say they may not have a
choice.</TE>
<TE>   If the county does not receive a $350-million bailout from the
federal government, there will be "dramatic downsizings in our
affiliations" with medical schools, said Dr. Thomas Garthwaite,
director of the county Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   The county pays USC $70.2 million annually to run County-USC
Medical Center in Boyle Heights, including physicians' salaries. It
pays Drew $11.9 million to run King/Drew, and UCLA $19.1 million to
manage Harbor-UCLA Medical Center near Torrance and Olive View-UCLA
Medical Center in Sylmar. The payments to Drew and UCLA do not
include the salaries of doctors who are county employees.</TE>
<TE>   Without a budget miracle, county officials will consider massive
service cuts this fall at Harbor and Olive View, possibly eliminating
emergency rooms and even ending inpatient services.</TE>
<TE>   All high-end services, such as transplants, are expected to be
consolidated at County-USC.</TE>
<TE>   Garthwaite and his advisors are also thinking of dropping historic
affiliations between individual hospitals and medical schools. In
their place, the county would ask the medical schools to work with
the county system as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   That might provide space for some faculty members and residents
squeezed out by the budget cuts. It also might allow a greater
emphasis on training doctors to work in community health programs,
which are less costly than hospital care.</TE>
<TE>   County-USC, Harbor, Olive View and King/Drew could see big changes
in their personnel, training and medical cultures. Now, each county
hospital is a bit of a fiefdom for the medical school that runs it.</TE>
<TE>   "The view of all health care being tied to a facility that's
next-door to a university is awfully myopic," Garthwaite said. "I
want to take advantage of the financial crisis we have here and push
toward a new system of care. I think it's the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA has the most to lose because its affiliates are the only ones
that could be converted from inpatient hospitals to clinics. (UCLA
will continue to train medical residents at its Westwood and Santa
Monica hospitals.)</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt that ... there's a little bit of edginess," said
Dr. J. Thomas Rosenthal, vice provost for the UCLA Medical Group.</TE>
<TE>   Health officials should ensure that UCLA remains in the county
system, Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's common sense to me that we should do everything we can to
keep a relationship with one of the best medical schools in the
United States, in the world," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, both sides agree that it would be strange for faculty
members from UCLA and USC to work side by side at County-USC.</TE>
<TE>   "From one faculty to another, a culture develops," Rosenthal said.
"You don't transpose people from one culture to another easily."</TE>
<TE>   USC officials said reorganization always produces conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   "This has nothing to do with, 'This is our turf' and 'That's your
turf,' " said Dr. Ron Kaufman, senior associate dean for
administration at the Keck School of Medicine at USC and former
County-USC administrator. "This is going to be very complicated, and
it's going to take years."</TE>
<TE>   Faculty members said the cutbacks could threaten the quality of
training and medical care.</TE>
<TE>   Drew University's Francis said he, too, is worried that
recruitment and retention of minority physicians will suffer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's conceivable that a less diverse faculty may result," Francis
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a much better record of our graduates' ending up serving
minority and underserved communities. That's really the strength of
Drew."</TE>
<TE>   Garthwaite said the county will continue to place a priority on
educating minority physicians and treating patients in a culturally
appropriate way.</TE>

<HD>Man Facing Life Term in Dog's Decapitation</HD>
<DH>Courts: La Habra man allegedly killed his German shepherd
to impress his girlfriend. A conviction would be his third strike.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A La Habra man who allegedly killed and mutilated his German shepherd
to impress his girlfriend could face life in prison for animal
cruelty under the state's three-strikes law, according to
prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   After a brief court appearance Tuesday by James A. Abernathy--the
40-year-old man authorities say used a collection of swords, shears
and knives to decapitate his dog--Orange County prosecutors said they
intended to pursue the matter as a three-strikes case. In addition to
the felony animal cruelty charge, Abernathy has twice been convicted
of aggravated assault.</LD>
<LD>   Abernathy's lawyer, William G. Morrissey, declined to comment on
the case Tuesday or the prosecution's intention to pursue the case as
a third strike.</LD>
<TE>   Although animal cruelty cases make up less than 1% of all criminal
cases filed in Orange County, Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Pear said
Abernathy's actions were enough to trigger a three-strikes sentence
upon conviction. Instead of three years in prison, Abernathy could
face 25 years to life.</TE>
<TE>   The dog's death in January outraged pet owners and animal rights
activists, who have inundated prosecutors and the court with letters
demanding stiff punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Abernathy's relatives say he has a history of violent behavior and
that they fear for their safety if he is released. He is currently
being held in Orange County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   "He really doesn't need to be out of jail. He's dangerous," said
Joyce M. Woodson, Abernathy's stepmother, who raised him from age 9.</TE>
<TE>   According to authorities and family members, police were called to
Abernathy's Chinchilla Street neighborhood Jan. 27, when the
sporadically employed defendant walked over to his next-door neighbor
and said he needed psychiatric help. The neighbor then called police.</TE>
<TE>   "He admitted to killing his dog after he had an argument with his
girlfriend," Police Capt. John Rees said in an interview Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Rees said officers walked next door and discovered the body of
Marie, Abernathy's year-old German shepherd mix, in the corner of a
closet. A wooden stake had been pounded into its chest and pruning
shears rested near its neck.</TE>
<TE>   Abernathy was taken to a psychiatric hospital for observation and
later transferred to the County Jail. Morrissey declined to comment
on his client's mental condition.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just bizarre," said George Abernathy, the defendant's
father. "He loved this dog, and he was trying to prove to this
girlfriend he just met that he loved her so much he could kill his
dog for her. He was going to prove that he loved her that much."</TE>
<TE>   Family members said Abernathy has been in and out of jails much of
his life and is known for bizarre, violent behavior. He collected
guns, swords, knives and other weapons, and once pointed a gun at his
sister's head, family members said.</TE>
<TE>   George Abernathy said his son's ambition as a youth was to join
the U.S. Army. He served briefly at Ft. Bragg in North Carolina
before he was discharged.</TE>
<TE>   After his military experience, Abernathy earned a certificate as a
physical trainer from Fullerton Junior College but did not pursue a
career in fitness, his father said. Instead, he worked sporadically
for general contractors--jobs his father said he would help him get
only to see him lose them shortly afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's scared of him," George Abernathy said. "If putting
him in prison for 25 years to life is going to prevent him from
hurting some innocent person, that's OK with me."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Docks State $18 Million in Foster Care Flap</HD>
<DH>Children: Federal officials say California isn't holding
relatives and nonrelatives to same standards for homes. But state
insists that it is.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A dispute between the state and federal governments over how
California screens foster parents will cost the state more than $18
million in grants, according to federal officials, and could
eventually drain hundreds of millions of dollars from state coffers.</LD>
<LD>   The federal government maintains that California has yet to
implement a 2-year-old federal mandate that relatives be held to the
same standards as professional foster parents to receive federal
grants to care for foster children in their homes.</LD>
<LD>   California has insisted that it always met the rule, because it
tests both kinds of caretakers for health and safety concerns, even
though the actual requirements may vary between the groups.</LD>
<TE>   State and federal officials have been arguing about the issue in
letters for more than a year. For much of that time, the federal
government has been threatening to not pay for relative foster homes
until the state equalizes the standards.</TE>
<TE>   It made good on that threat this month.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Fujii, head of the Pacific region of the Administration for
Children and Families, said Tuesday that her agency reduced
California's July-September grant award by 17%, which it determined
was the portion of foster families that did not meet federal
requirements. Fujii said the state requested $109 million for that
period, but was approved for only $90 million "for failing to
implement relative licensing provisions of the Adoptions and Safe
Families Act."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the state Department of Social Services declined
to comment, saying that her agency had only been told orally of the
reduction and that any decision to challenge the reduction would be
made after receiving it in writing.</TE>
<TE>   Fujii said the federal government will also be auditing the
state's bills for foster care for the last two years to determine how
much was paid for relative caretakers who did not meet the same
standards as nonrelatives, a first step toward reclaiming improper
payments. One state estimate circulated last year put the amount in
jeopardy at close to $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government does not dictate all the health and safety
standards that states can use to assess foster homes.</TE>
<TE>   Since January 2000, however, it has required that whatever rules
states chose must be applied to relative and professional foster
homes.</TE>
<TE>   States were given nine months to equalize their standards.</TE>
<TE>   California passed emergency legislation in October that it said
was meant to clarify that the standards are equal, but many
acknowledge that it did raise some safety standards for relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Counties were required to implement the new standards by January.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles met that deadline for new homes, according to county
documents. But it has been a slow process to assess the county's more
than 9,000 relatives who were approved as foster parents under the
old standards.</TE>
<TE>   A study of 200 randomly selected relative foster parents released
in March showed that only 1% would meet current standards. The
problems ranged from overcrowding, with children sharing beds with
adults or sleeping on mattresses or in sleeping bags on floors, to
unsanitary or hazardous conditions, including roach infestations,
plumbing problems and homes and yards filled with garbage.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard School, Fresno Campus Teaming Up</HD>
<DH>Education: Community college students will be able to stay
home and get a bachelor's in industrial technology through a Cal
State program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High school graduates will soon be able to earn degrees from two
state universities in Ventura County when Oxnard College begins
offering a four-year degree in partnership with Cal State Fresno next
year.</LD>
<LD>   Students may earn a bachelor's degree in industrial technology
from Cal State Fresno without ever stepping on its campus. Instead,
they can take all their classes at Oxnard College's satellite center
in Camarillo.</LD>
<LD>   Cal State Channel Islands, which officially begins classes this
fall in Camarillo, is the only other state university to offer
four-year degrees in the county.</LD>
<TE>   The goal of the alliance between Cal State Fresno and the county
Community College District is to better serve the needs of Ventura
County students and businesses, said Cheryl Shearer, dean of
technology and business at Oxnard College</TE>
<TE>   The community college offers a two-year degree in industrial
technology, with graduates trained to be, for example, computer
network engineers, system administrators or school district
technology aides. But there is a need for workers to expand their
skills, Shearer said, and with many students aspiring to become
managers, a bachelor's degree becomes almost a necessity.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the rising number of high-tech companies moving into
Ventura County has increased the need for skilled workers, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Classes will begin in January 2003 for Ventura County community
college students who have at least 56 transferable credits and who
meet general CSU admissions standards. Officials anticipate a full
class, with as many as 20 students.</TE>
<TE>   The plan is to offer two or three classes each term, allowing
students to graduate in about 2 1/2 years. Classes will be taught by
instructors on site, said Kathleen Alfano, who was instrumental in
creating the program.</TE>
<TE>   "We want people to get really strong instruction, and to feel they
really are part of a bachelor's program," said Alfano, director of
the National Science Foundation Regional Center at College of the
Canyons in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   She said about 50 prospective students attended a recent meeting
that explained the new industrial technology major.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomores Eric and Nicholas Conger, 19-year-old twins who live in
Simi Valley, said the variety of jobs in the field appeals to them.
With Cal State Fresno offering a four-year degree locally, the twins
are considering industrial technology as a major.</TE>
<TE>   "Having [the college] be closer to home--that would be a lot
easier," Eric Conger said. "And I assume it's going to be less
expensive than paying tuition at a four-year" college.</TE>
<TE>   Students can save thousands of dollars by attending a local
community college before transferring to a CSU bachelor's program.
For example, students pay about $400 in tuition and fees annually to
attend Oxnard College; the rate to enroll in the Cal State Fresno
industrial technology classes averages about $1,800 per year.</TE>
<TE>   Students could also save money by avoiding relocation to the
Fresno campus, said Jeanne Bailey, a spokeswoman for Moorpark
College, which also offers industrial technology classes and whose
students, along with Ventura College students, are also eligible to
take part in the Cal State Fresno partnership.Community College
District officials say they would like to expand degrees to a variety
of majors.</TE>
<TE>   That is happening at College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita, a
community college that offers a variety of bachelor's degree
programs, an MBA program and a doctorate in school administration
through partnerships with several universities in California. The
college's enrollment has increased each semester, said Bruce Battle,
a spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Administrators at Cal State Channel Islands, which has filled
about 80% of its fall enrollment, say they aren't worried about
competition for students. They hope the convenience of new degree
programs will prompt more area residents to earn four-year degrees.</TE>
<TE>   And that is the goal--to create more opportunities for students to
earn degrees, said computer instructor Edmond Garcia, who works in
the industrial technology department at Moorpark College.</TE>
<TE>   "Since this partnership happened, more and more schools have been
interested in it," he said. "And as the idea is put on the table, and
we're seeing the commitment taking place, hopefully [more
partnerships] will come to fruition."</TE>

<HD>Russ Freeman, 76; Jazz Pianist, Songwriter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Russ Freeman, a jazz pianist best known for his pivotal supporting
role in the early work of mercurial trumpeter Chet Baker, has died.
He was 76.</LD>
<LD>   Freeman, who also had a long and musically productive association
with the drummer Shelly Manne, died June 27 at a hospice in Las
Vegas. The cause of death was not announced by his family.</LD>
<LD>   In 1954, Freeman was hired by Richard Bock, the founder of Pacific
Jazz records, to work with Baker on the trumpeter's first recording
for the label. But on this date, Freeman was more than a pianist. He
served as Baker's musical director, picking the songs, arranging the
music and teaching the material to Baker.</LD>
<TE>   "He was the perfect pianist for Chet at that time," Bock told jazz
journalist Wil Thornbury years later. "He was largely responsible for
the success that the quartet had as far as being able to be a unit to
work. Not only did he pick the tunes, he wrote the tunes, he taught
Chet what he needed to know to play them, [and] took care of business
on the road."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Chicago, Freeman moved with his family to Los Angeles at
the age of 5. He started studying classical piano three years later
but switched to jazz in high school, where he was influenced by the
emerging sounds of the great bebop players Charlie Parker and Dizzy
Gillespie.</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1940s, he had developed into a fine bebop pianist in a
band led by trumpeter Howard McGhee, which occasionally featured
Parker during the days he lived in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But although Freeman loved bebop, he also was versatile enough to
work well in a broad range of styles. In the late '40s and early
'50s, he worked in local bands that included such top players as
saxophonists Dexter Gordon, Art Pepper and Wardell Gray.</TE>
<TE>   He also played with the Lighthouse All-Stars and a band led by
Shorty Rogers.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman also was developing into a fine songwriter. His
compositions would include "Bea's Flat," "Band Aid" and most notably
"The Wind," which over the years has been recorded by such diverse
talents as guitarist Jim Hall, pianists Keith Jarrett and Ramsey
Lewis, Baker, and singers June Christy and pop star Mariah Carey.</TE>
<TE>   In 1954, Freeman's career took a sharp turn when he teamed up with
Baker, the star-crossed trumpeter, whom he had known since 1952.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman later told Down Beat magazine that Baker was "... the only
one who could play my songs the way I hear them. He had such an
innate feeling for them."</TE>
<TE>   As to Baker's overall talent, the pianist added: "When he was
right, he was as good as anyone--and that includes Charlie Parker,
Dizzy Gillespie, and all.... There were nights when Chet would finish
playing a solo, and I'd be sitting there, and I'd feel: What's the
point of trying to play a solo now? He just said it all."</TE>
<TE>   The album that came out from that 1954 session, "Chet Baker
Quartet Featuring Russ Freeman," was one of the seminal recordings of
Baker's drug-plagued career.</TE>
<TE>   In his authoritative book on the Los Angeles jazz scene at
mid-century, "West Coast Jazz, Modern Jazz in California, 1945-60,"
Ted Gioia notes that the Baker-Freeman association "forms the
trumpeter's most important legacy from the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   "... Baker's playing would never again be at such a consistently
high level, and seldom would he find a group of sidemen as stable and
sympathetic as those on these sessions. Further, Baker's most
outstanding work as a singer also dates from this period."</TE>
<TE>   After leaving Baker, Freeman joined Manne and played with him for
12 years. He and Manne had an excellent musical relationship, and
when the two weren't playing in the quintet--Shelly Manne and His
Men--they would experiment with duo playing without the usual bass
accompaniment.</TE>
<TE>   "Playing on the job," Freeman told Ted Gioia, "Shelly and I used
to do things together in the rhythm section, not just counterpoint to
the horns, but between us. Instead of playing a drum solo or a piano
solo, in some spots, we'd play a solo at the same time, trying to
feel each other out, with an awareness of each other being there."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond his work with Baker and Manne, Freeman recorded an
innovative trio album with a young jazz pianist named Andre Previn
that featured two pianos and drums.</TE>
<TE>   He toured Europe with Benny Goodman, and pretty much abandoned
jazz work after he left Manne in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   He worked as musical director for singer-dancer Mitzi Gaynor and
as musical director for television's "Laugh-In" and later "Tony
Orlando and Dawn." He worked in studios writing the underscores for
films and in Las Vegas as musical director for shows.</TE>
<TE>   His final jazz recording, "One on One" with Manne, came out in
1982.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman is survived by his wife, Carolyn; daughter Paula
Freeman-Allison; stepdaughter Gale Tripp; and three grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial celebration will be held July 18 at the Jazz Bakery.
Donations will go to the L.A. Jazz Society's mentorship fund for
piano students.</TE>

<HD>Hospital Closure Blocked</HD>
<DH>Health: The state tells Daniel Freeman Marina facility's
owner to honor its commitments first.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NERISSA PACIO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state attorney general's office has told the owner of Daniel
Freeman Marina Hospital that neither the hospital nor its emergency
room can be closed until the firm honors certain commitments made
when it bought the facility in December. Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer gave
Tenet Healthcare Corp. until Monday to respond to his office's
findings, spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said.</LD>
<LD>   About 100 community organizers, residents of Marina del Rey and
Venice, and a few of the Marina hospital's doctors rallied on the
front lawn of the facility Monday to celebrate the temporary
reprieve. The ER was slated to close July 22, followed by the rest of
the hospital in August.</LD>
<LD>   "The refusal of Tenet to consult our community has given the
hospital a second life," said Maura Kealey, a spokeswoman for Service
Employees International Union, which is part of a community coalition
seeking to save the 166-bed hospital.</LD>
<TE>   Michioku said Tenet has not provided documents proving that it
solicited public input or consulted with community-based health
organizations, local elected officials or hospital employees before
deciding to close the hospital. Tenet has also failed to show that
the publicity campaign informs residents of other nearby urgent-care
or ambulatory-care facilities that serve Medi-Cal and Medicare
recipients and provide charity care, Michioku said.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet spokesman David Langness said the company believes that it
has complied with the attorney general's conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a long list of people we consulted in the community,"
Langness said. "But we will try to resolve any barriers that still
exist."</TE>
<TE>   In December, Tenet bought two Daniel Freeman hospitals for $55
million from the St. Louis-based Catholic hospital chain Carondolet
Health System. The hospitals were losing $23 million a year and the
Marina hospital treated only 40 acute-care patients a day, hospital
officials had said.</TE>
<TE>   The 358-bed Daniel Freeman hospital in Inglewood will remain open.
The Marina hospital's psychiatric and chemical dependency unit has
already closed. The hospital will be the second one shut by Tenet in
the county this year.</TE>
<TE>   "The Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital closing coupled with the
public health-care crisis facing Los Angeles County will exacerbate
the access to quality and timely health-care services for Los Angeles
residents," said Assemblyman George Nakano (D-Torrance), whose
district includes Marina del Rey, Playa del Rey and Venice.</TE>

<HD>Lawsuit Targets 12,350-Home Irvine Project</HD>
<DH>Land use: Defend the Bay calls review of plan for El Toro
property inadequate. Councilman says the organization lacks public
support.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of environmentalists filed suit Tuesday in Superior Court to
block the Irvine Co.'s plan to build a community of 35,000 residents
on land around the mothballed El Toro Marine base.</LD>
<LD>   In its lawsuit, Newport Beach-based Defend the Bay says the city's
environmental review of the 7,743-acre project was inadequate. Irvine
and the Irvine Co. are named as defendants, along with several other
government agencies.</LD>
<LD>   The Northern Sphere plan was unanimously approved by the City
Council last month. It permits construction of 12,350 homes and more
than 7 million square feet of commercial space on county land the
city plans to annex.</LD>
<TE>   The development would create a sub-city roughly the size of San
Juan Capistrano near the Irvine Spectrum.</TE>
<TE>   More than half the land would be preserved as open space.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Caustin, executive director of Defend the Bay, says the
project is far too dense for the busy area near the Irvine Spectrum.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who approved this project are in their own little
world, dancing to the tune of the Irvine Co.," he said. "This project
should have been downsized. People are going to be sitting in
traffic, waiting for the light to change three times before they can
even get to the intersection."</TE>
<TE>   Defend the Bay launched a referendum campaign last month to
overturn the vote, but abandoned that effort, feeling that the city
was vilifying the group as outsiders. But city officials say the
failure of that campaign shows that the community supports the
Northern Sphere project.</TE>
<TE>   "[Defend the Bay] quickly discovered they have no popular support,
so they turned to the courts," said Councilman Chris Mears.</TE>
<TE>   Mears says Defend the Bay's true motive is reviving the plan to
build an airport at El Toro, noting that all the projects the group
fights are under the flight path of the once-proposed airport. The
land would have to remain undeveloped for an airport to be viable.</TE>
<TE>   Caustin says such comments are part of a city-orchestrated "smear
campaign" against his organization.</TE>
<TE>   Defend the Bay has sued the city once and won, over approval of a
plan to convert 600 acres of strawberry and bean fields into a
10.2-million-square-foot addition to the Irvine Spectrum. A Superior
Court judge ruled in January that the city's environmental review of
that project did not reasonably consider alternatives to the Irvine
Co.'s proposal.</TE>

<LD>Gene Kan, one of the pioneers of the file-sharing technology called
Gnutella, was found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound,
a coroner's spokeswoman said Tuesday. He was 25.</LD>
<LD>   Kan's body was found July 2 at his home in Belmont, between San
Francisco and San Jose, according to Sue Turner of the San Mateo
County medical examiner's office.</LD>
<LD>   She said that Kan's death likely will be ruled a suicide, but that
an investigation is continuing.</LD>
<TE>   A statement released Monday by his employer, Sun Microsystems
Inc., said that Kan died as the result of an accident and that no
further details of his death were being released at the request of
his family.</TE>
<TE>   Kan was among the first to develop an open-source version of the
Gnutella protocol--a small bit of computer code used by a distributed
network of PCs for massive file-sharing duties.</TE>
<TE>   Gnutella, which took music swapping beyond the realm of Napster,
came along as Shawn Fanning's Napster program became mired in
lawsuits by the recording industry.</TE>
<TE>   Kan and a small clutch of developers honed the Gnutella protocol
so that programmers around the world could make their own home-brewed
computer applications--each speaking the same language and capable of
pointing users to shared music, video and software files.</TE>
<TE>   The main difference between the Gnutella network and other
file-sharing programs was a crucial one. Gnutella has no company to
sue or central servers to shut down with a court injunction.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no head to the Gnutella dragon," Kan told the Associated
Press in 2000. After that interview, Kan quickly became the ad hoc
spokesman for Gnutella's development during file-swapping debates
surrounding Napster.</TE>
<TE>   Kan lived in a Belmont home with other software developers during
Gnutella's early days.</TE>
<TE>   Their living room was strewn with desktop and laptop computers
networked with high-speed cables as they tested early incarnations of
Gnutella.</TE>
<TE>   The group didn't invent Gnutella from scratch.</TE>
<TE>   Kan and his colleagues merely brought it into focus after an early
version of a program appeared briefly on the Web site of Nullsoft, a
subsidiary of America Online.</TE>
<TE>   The Gnutella code was available only briefly, but that was long
enough for Kan and other developers to download it. Kan acknowledged
that some unauthorized files were being traded through the Gnutella
network.</TE>
<TE>   "How users make use of it, I hate to say it's not our problem, but
it really isn't," Kan said.</TE>
<TE>   The simple Gnutella protocol spawned a legion of file-sharing
programs that remain popular today. The programs LimeWire, BearShare
and Phex all make use of the Gnutella engine.</TE>
<TE>   "Gene was really good at communicating the technical merits of the
peer-to-peer approach," said author and entrepreneur Cory Doctorow,
who took part in many panel discussions with Kan.</TE>
<TE>   Sun spokeswoman Carrie Motamedi said Kan had been working on
advanced computing projects for Sun.</TE>
<TE>   "Gene contributed much to the industry, specifically in the
peer-to-peer space," Sun said in its statement. "Gene brought new
ideas to the organization and stretched our thinking."</TE>

<DH>Health: Criticized for not disclosing Legionnaires'
outbreak, officials vow to require hospital alerts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Facing sharp criticism from the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors, health officials said Tuesday that they will require
Good Samaritan Hospital to alert all patients admitted since January
about a recent Legionnaires' disease outbreak at the hospital.</LD>
<LD>   And they vowed to mandate similar written notification in future
outbreaks of that and other infectious diseases at all hospitals in
the county.</LD>
<LD>   County health officials have faced strong criticism for their
decision not to promptly inform the public about the Legionnaires'
outbreak at Good Samaritan, in which nine people became sick, two of
whom died. Good Samaritan said the deaths--one in May, one in
June--were not related to the hospital-acquired infections.</LD>
<TE>   As the supervisors Tuesday expressed anger about the delayed
disclosure, the county's health chief pledged to send inspectors into
hospitals unannounced to ensure that they are reporting disease
outbreaks as required by law. The names of hospitals cited for
violations would be made public, said Dr. Thomas Garthwaite, director
of the county Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to make sure that we're looking aggressively at
the infection control procedures in hospitals," Garthwaite told the
supervisors. He said in an interview that he may need additional
staff to conduct the surprise inspections, which are expected to
begin within three months.</TE>
<TE>   Good Samaritan, an independent nonprofit institution, said it will
follow the county's order to notify patients, provide information
about the symptoms of Legionnaires' and encourage people with
questions to contact doctors. Those letters will be sent to patients
admitted after Jan. 8 and continue with all new patients until
testing and decontamination are completed. Previously, the hospital
has held information sessions for physicians, employees and
volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   No new cases of hospital-acquired Legionnaires' have been reported
since mid-June, leading the hospital and county to say that the
outbreak has been contained.</TE>
<TE>   However, Good Samaritan officials said Tuesday that they still are
working to rid their water system of Legionella pneumophila bacteria,
which causes the infection. The hospital is conducting a chlorine
flush of its plumbing system this week after tests showed that an
earlier superheated water flush did not eliminate traces of the
bacteria in the system.</TE>
<TE>   "We think we have gone beyond, even beyond the recommendations of
the department of public health, to eliminate this bacteria," Good
Samaritan Vice President Sammy Feuerlicht said.</TE>
<TE>   As a precautionary measure, the hospital is serving some patients
bottled water and giving them sponge baths, instead of letting them
shower. The hospital is testing all incoming patients with
pneumonia-like symptoms for Legionnaires' disease, and it has found
some patients who acquired the infection outside the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Gloria Molina focused her criticism on county
employees, not the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a real problem in public health," Molina said. "Heaven
forbid that anthrax comes in to this community.... They're going to
keep it in their shorts before they tell anyone else. That's
inappropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Garthwaite said his department acted quickly to discover the cause
of the outbreak and respond to it, but he faulted the way he and the
public were notified. Garthwaite said he did not learn of the
outbreak until June 30, the day before The Times reported it.</TE>
<TE>   According to a county-produced timeline, public health officials
learned of the first case of Legionnaires' at Good Samaritan on Feb.
26.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a culture in the health department that they know
better than the public," said Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, "that the
public is just a bunch of boobs that aren't equipped to handle bad
news."</TE>
<TE>   John Schunhoff, chief of operations for county public health, said
his agency needs to change. Local public health officials previously
have been accused of withholding information on outbreaks, including
contaminated strawberries that made children sick in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a traditional tendency to err on the side of not
disclosing, as opposed to disclosing," Schunhoff said. "We're going
to change that culture."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors Molina and Mike Antonovich pressed Garthwaite for a
written policy on how he will handle future disease outbreaks. They
also asked him to report on corrective actions and discipline taken
against employees who decided not to inform the public about the
Legionnaires' outbreak.</TE>
<TE>   "Keeping the outbreak from the public, the department raises
suspicions of a cover-up," Antonovich said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Legionnaires' story broke, Garthwaite has required that
public health officials tell him of all disease outbreaks so he can
personally decide which ones to make public. So far, he has not
released information on any of them.</TE>
<TE>   "There's too much latitude [within the public health agency] to
decide which infections they're investigating ought to be bumped up
the chain," he said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>At last count, we had several investigations in the works, including
one by Inglewood police and one by the L.A. County Sheriff. But I saw
the videotape, and I can save everyone some time.</LD>
<LD>   There is nothing to investigate.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, I know. We aren't sure what, if anything, 16-year-old Donovan
Jackson might have done to provoke officers during a traffic stop
Saturday. But it doesn't matter.</LD>
<TE>   You do not take a juvenile, cuff his hands behind him, slam his
head onto the hood of a car, and then sucker punch him in the face.
Not unless you're trying out for the World Wrestling Federation.</TE>
<TE>   My feelings were shared by 100-plus demonstrators who showed up at
Inglewood City Hall Tuesday morning to demand that the mayor, the
chief of police--anybody--stand up and say that Officer Jeremy Morse
should not just be fired, but prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, Morse has merely been suspended, with pay. The guy
establishes himself as one of the great sissies of all time, roughing
up a handcuffed kid, and he's getting paid to sit at home.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, police say Jackson became combative after they
followed his father's car into a gas station to ask about a lapsed
registration. The story from the other side is that Jackson is
developmentally disabled and became confused after returning to the
car with a bag of potato chips. His father and attorney say he was
punched by police and then dragged by a silver chain he wore around
his neck.</TE>
<TE>   Morse, by the way, is white, and Jackson is black. But one of the
cops at the scene was black and one brown, and Najee Ali, a black man
who organized the demonstration, told me the issue isn't race. The
issue is a police culture in which it's OK to beat the living
daylights out of people in primarily minority neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   I asked a Los Angeles secretary named Sherri Mayes what
specifically motivated her to take a day off work and join the
demonstration on a blazing hot day, and the answer came up into her
eyes and smoldered there.</TE>
<TE>   "Anger."</TE>
<TE>   Mayes watched the video in horror, then told her 6-year-old son it
isn't supposed to be like that. But this was no isolated incident,
she claimed. What makes it different was that it was caught on
videotape.</TE>
<TE>   Look, the truth is that most cops don't go around beating people
up. The problem is that you can't find any cops who'll report the
ones who do.</TE>
<TE>   Before we congratulate Inglewood police for calling the incident
disturbing and immediately suspending the officer, do you think we
would have heard about this case if not for the videotape? Would any
of the officers at the scene have blown the whistle on one of their
own?</TE>
<TE>   My money says no. Why else would Morse have had no qualms about
brazenly clocking a restrained juvenile in the presence of fellow
officers?</TE>
<TE>   During the demonstration, I wandered up to two Inglewood
detectives and asked if they could imagine any circumstances under
which Morse acted appropriately.</TE>
<TE>   "There's two sides to every story," said one.</TE>
<TE>   I rest my case.</TE>
<TE>   I slipped away from the demonstration for a scheduled meeting with
Inglewood Mayor Roosevelt Dorn in his ninth-floor office. But before
we could sit down, the demonstrators poured out of the elevators
behind me and pressed toward Dorn's office, demanding a meeting.
Someone called police, who drew scowls, and one demonstrator chided,
"Here come the beaters."</TE>
<TE>   "No justice, no peace!" the crowd chanted as Najee Ali told city
officials that nobody was leaving until the mayor appeared.</TE>
<TE>   (Ali, by the way, told me that New York Rev. Al Sharpton had
called to say he'll be here for a Friday demonstration. Good for
Reverend Al, but if you ask me, it's a sad commentary on the void in
leadership in Southern California. We shouldn't need an outsider
showing us how to shake a stick.)</TE>
<TE>   In his moment of truth, Mayor Dorn appeared before a restless mob
and got off to a terrible start by saying he would recommend
suspension without pay. One man in the crowd shouted down the mayor
and began jawing with a guy who implored him to let the mayor
continue.</TE>
<TE>   And then Dorn, a former prosecutor and judge, hit his stride. He
had already watched the video enough times to conclude that whatever
happened before the camera began rolling, it did not justify the
assault on Jackson. And so the mayor said the investigation of Morse
will proceed, "but it is my opinion that he should be fired."</TE>
<TE>   There was more, too. Dorn wanted him brought up on charges.</TE>
<TE>   "No. 1, for felony assault. No. 2, assault with a deadly
weapon--the car. And No. 3, battery. In my city, this type of conduct
will not be tolerated."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor and I then came face-to-face in a crowded elevator, and
he told me he's looking into whether he can cut off the suspended
officer's pay. Perspiration beaded on his face, and there's more of
that to come, but he'd made a cool recovery on a day when the heat
closed in around him early.</TE>

<HD>Search Underway in 2 Counties for Woman</HD>
<DH>Disappearance: The Pasadena resident, 66, was due at
family's Shaver Lake cabin more than a week ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Law enforcement officials in two counties are searching for a
Pasadena woman who has been missing for more than a week.</LD>
<LD>   Elizabeth Whiting, 66, was scheduled to leave her home on the
morning of June 30 to drive to a family vacation home at Shaver Lake
in Fresno County. After she failed to arrive, a nephew checked her
apartment, found that she wasn't home, and called police.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, police said, there has been no trace of Whiting, who
is known to have had transient ischemic attacks, or mini-strokes.</LD>
<TE>   "This is such a mystery for us," said Janet Pope, a spokeswoman
for the Pasadena Police Department, which is coordinating a search
effort with the California Highway Patrol, Fresno Police Department
and Fresno County Sheriff's Department. "We have nothing to go on."</TE>
<TE>   Family members and police have searched for Whiting along the
route from Pasadena to Shaver Lake by airplane and helicopter. Family
members walked and rode the roads leading to Shaver Lake, Pope said,
but turned up no sign of her.</TE>
<TE>   Whiting was last seen on June 29 at a La Canada Flintridge
sporting goods store. She spoke with relatives when she got home,
family members said, and told them that she would be leaving early
the next morning for the cabin so that she could arrive before dark.</TE>
<TE>   Her credit cards have not been used since then, they said, nor has
her cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   Pope said investigators do not believe foul play is involved in
Whiting's disappearance. "She was planning this trip, we know she
left for the trip, and we have traced her using bloodhounds to the
freeway onramp," Pope said.</TE>
<TE>   Whiting is described as 5 feet 5, 145 pounds, with brown eyes and
gray hair. She was driving a black Nissan Maxima with California
license plates 4FZH387.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who may have seen Whiting or her vehicle is asked to call
Pasadena police at (626) 744-4241.</TE>

<HD>Suit Set on MTA's Screening of Drivers</HD>
<DH>Safety: Lawyers for a teenage boy molested by a convicted
felon hired by the agency allege that criminal background checks are
inadequate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lawyers for a 16-year-old boy molested by an MTA bus driver who was a
convicted felon plan to file a civil lawsuit today claiming that the
transit agency fails to adequately screen its drivers for criminal
backgrounds.</LD>
<LD>   Metropolitan Transportation Authority driver Anthony Zaragoza
pleaded guilty in February to molesting the boy aboard his bus and to
previous assaults on two other children.</LD>
<LD>   Zaragoza, a father of three who worked for the transit agency
despite having been convicted in 1980 of armed robbery, was sentenced
to nearly 30 years in prison.</LD>
<TE>   The driver's guilty plea came after a video of the June 20, 2001,
attack was played during a preliminary hearing. The 140-pound victim,
a North Carolina resident, had surreptitiously turned on a video
camera he was carrying as Zaragoza, a 325-pound man, began making
sexual advances.</TE>
<TE>   Alone with the boy on a Hollywood side street, Zaragoza is heard
saying, "I could pin you to the floor and take your pants off without
you stopping me." The driver then fondled the boy before letting him
off the bus.</TE>
<TE>   MTA officials, who were not aware of the pending legal filing when
reached for comment Tuesday, insist that they screen all job
applicants and do all they can to closely supervise their work force,
with an eye on safety for riders. They said a lawsuit would be
baseless.</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer for the boy said the fact that Zaragoza worked for the
MTA suggests that the agency does not adequately check for criminal
backgrounds. "This case shows once again that they have a completely
inadequate record-keeping system," said attorney David Ring. "They
seem to have no idea how many drivers have had felony convictions....
It's a danger to the public." Ring said that at the very least, the
agency should have supervised Zaragoza better.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the MTA settled a similar case, paying $1.95 million to a
woman raped by an MTA driver aboard a bus in El Monte. In that
incident, driver Leonard Howell worked for the MTA despite having a
felony rape conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Zaragoza and Howell are among four MTA bus drivers charged with
sex crimes involving passengers over the last four years. The agency
employs about 4,200 drivers and operates a fleet of about 2,100 buses
throughout the county.</TE>
<TE>   Zaragoza was hired in 1989 by the Southern California Rapid
Transit District, the MTA's predecessor. By then, he had had his
felony reduced to a misdemeanor, taking advantage of a state law
applying to felons who did not serve prison time, and then had his
record expunged.</TE>
<TE>   MTA officials have said they were aware of Zaragoza's background,
but could not have legally kept him from working. The MTA's lead
lawyer said Tuesday that the agency could not have known that
Zaragoza would sexually attack a rider.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a reasonable argument that the MTA is not responsible
for something this aberrant," Steve Carnevale said. "If we hired him
and he had a history of molesting kids, that's one thing. But we
didn't know he had a propensity to do this stuff more than anyone
else.... It's not the bus company's fault he decided to molest the
kid."</TE>
<TE>   MTA spokesman Marc Littman said the agency toughened its standards
and background checks for hiring drivers in 1996. He said a person
convicted of rape 20 years ago still could be hired as a driver,
however, "if they have served their time and paid their debt to
society."</TE>
<TE>   Ring said the boy, who was visiting Los Angeles and touring
Hollywood when he was molested, is struggling to come to terms with
the attack. "He's trying to put it past him. He's a strong kid," Ring
said. "But those were the worst 10 minutes of his life."</TE>
<TE>   The boy's family is seeking unspecified monetary damages for
emotional and physical distress.</TE>

<HD>Burger Joint's Burrito Recipe Was Cooked Up From Kosher
Beginnings</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As I mentioned, Caltrans intends to erect a building on the downtown
site of the landmark Kosher Burrito stand, and, alas, the bulldozers
arrived the other day to clean the eatery's plate. But don't sell
your Pepto-Bismol stock yet. You can still buy the tortilla brick of
pastrami, chili, onions, pickles and mustard at John's Burgers a
block away on 1st Street.</LD>
<LD>   Not that owner John Kim is capitalizing on his rival's downfall.
"We've served a kosher burrito for 20 years," he said. And from whom
did he learn it? "My sister-in-law's husband," Kim said. "He owned
the Kosher Burrito back then."</LD>
<LD>   The weird world of fashion: Today's exhibits (see accompanying)
include:</LD>
<TE>   * A clothing store with a catchy name on the island of Bora Bora
(snapped by Jerry Lewine of Agoura Hills). I guess it was stocked
with really baggy swimsuits.</TE>
<TE>   * A good place to buy a suit of armor (snapped by Gerald Jones of
L.A.).</TE>
<TE>   * And, a shop that sold Phil Proctor's daughter something, but he
can't figure out what it was.</TE>
<TE>   A true sun worshiper: Teacher Terri Lau writes that one of her
colleagues freely admits attending church in a swimsuit as a kid--all
the better to make a quick dash to the beach afterward. The other
parishioners not only weren't startled but didn't even notice.
Reason: She was attending the drive-in service that Emmanuel Lutheran
Church of North Hollywood used to offer in the 1950s and 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Further proof that sex sells: I knew the phone companies would
offer almost anything to gain new customers. But even I wasn't
prepared for the come-on that Lloyd McDaniel of Costa Mesa spotted
(see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Traveler's advisory: Barry Socher was researching home rentals in
Switzerland via the Internet when he found the following comments
about one farm:</TE>
<TE>   * "The living/sleeping room has a table on the most beautiful spot
with full view over the lake, the mountains, the village and the
neighbor farmer."</TE>
<TE>   * "As we are on a farm, animals are difficult and have to be
discussed."</TE>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept: Tom Mantke saw a TV commercial in which a
truck is being chased by a flying saucer but escapes into a tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   "The UFO is aiming a tractor beam at the vehicle, apparently
trying an abduction," Mantke said. "In the fine print, the commercial
says, 'Do not attempt.' "</TE>
<TE>   Asks Mantke: "Does that mean if aliens try to abduct you, you
should let them?"</TE>
<TE>   That was my strategy years ago, Tom, and it worked out well. After
they reformatted my brain to notice crazy signs and weird typos, they
let me go.</TE>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept (cont.): As one who is weary of tailgating
trucks, every time I watch that commercial I root for the flying
saucer.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Louise Wilson of Claremont was lunching at a Chinese
restaurant when her husband received this fortune in his cookie:
"Promote literacy. Buy a box of fortune cookies today."</TE>

<LD>You probably know someone who's said it. Perhaps you've said it
yourself.</LD>
<LD>   I don't want a slow, painful death. When the time comes, I want to
die on my own terms.</LD>
<LD>   The question is: Could you end your own life?</LD>
<TE>   An even tougher question: Could you help someone you love do it?</TE>
<TE>   A North Carolina freelance journalist will be in Southern
California this weekend for the premiere of a 55-minute film he
helped make of his father's final months, up to and including his
suicide from an overdose of pills.</TE>
<TE>   Making the documentary all the more poignant, Jay Niver says, is
that he and his twin, Gretchen, were with their father, Sam Niver, as
he ended his own life in June 1998 rather than continue fighting
prostate cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Titled "Live and Let Go--An American Death" and shot with longtime
family friend and filmmaker Jay Spain, the documentary will premiere
at 1 p.m. Sunday at the DancesWithFilms festival at the Laemmle's
theater in Santa Monica. Sam Niver was a member of the Hemlock
Society, a national organization that supports physician-assisted
suicides. Jay Niver says his father tried but failed to get a
physician to assist him.</TE>
<TE>   While the film deals mostly with reminiscences and moments from
Sam Niver's life, it is intended to focus attention on the
controversial right-do-die movement. Oregon is the only state that
provides for physician-assisted suicides, but U.S. Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft has publicly stated his opposition and the controversy has
reheated.</TE>
<TE>   In its broadest terms, the issue is simple: Should a terminally
ill person, in concert with a physician, have the right to end his or
her life?</TE>
<TE>   Orange County has one of the state's four Hemlock Society
chapters, and board member Ralph Wiens of Laguna Niguel says it has
about 400 members. Niver's film has been touted within the
organization, Wiens says, but he adds wryly: "The Hemlock Society [in
Orange County] is loaded with a bunch of old guys. Going 70 miles to
Santa Monica for a movie might be too much."</TE>
<TE>   Wiens, 73, says local membership spiked a bit after Ashcroft's
denunciation of the Oregon law. The movement's emphasis, Wiens says,
"is just to shorten the dying process, to make it a pleasant event
... once it's determined that someone is dying and the only decision
is whether to do it the hard way or the easy way.... We want a person
to have their own last wishes met."</TE>
<TE>   Jay Niver and Spain recorded 22 hours of interviews with Sam
Niver, who was 76 when he died.</TE>
<TE>   "He planned to have a close friend sit with him for moral
support," Niver says. "My sister and I said, 'No way. We should be
the ones to sit and hold your hand, not a friend.' "</TE>
<TE>   Niver says his father was hoping they'd offer but had been
unwilling to ask them. The elder Niver had told his children (he had
another son who was not present at his suicide) several months before
his death of his plans, Jay Niver says.</TE>
<TE>   "He felt very strongly about physician-assisted suicide," Niver,
49, says. "He wanted to make a statement about it and asked me if I
wanted to write a story."</TE>
<TE>   Niver balked but wanted to memorialize his father with the video.
"Sixty percent to 65% of it is about him growing up," Niver says.
"The other 35% to 40% is about dying with dignity."</TE>
<TE>   Niver contacted me after learning about my own father's long bout
with heart and kidney disease. I told Niver I didn't know if I'd have
been able to witness my father's suicide, no matter how despairing
family members had gotten over his declining health and quality of
life.</TE>
<TE>   But what if Dad had asked? What if he'd pressed me to help?</TE>
<TE>   I'm glad he didn't, but even if I'd said no, it wouldn't have been
on philosophical grounds. I can't make an argument for continued
suffering and the attendant indignity that often comes with a
protracted and terminal illness.</TE>
<TE>   "We can take care of the pain, we can empty bed pans, but what can
we do to restore dignity to an individual who wants autonomy?" Niver
asks. "That's the one thing critics can't answer. They try to define
quality of life for the other person."</TE>

<HD>State Is Hit With Power Emergency</HD>
<DH>Electricity: Several generating plants interrupt service
amid rising temperatures, but blackouts are avoided. Energy prices
soar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL and KELLY YAMANOUCHI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Searing heat across the West and an unusual number of power plant
shutdowns forced California to declare an electricity supply
emergency Tuesday for the first time in a year.</LD>
<LD>   No blackouts were triggered, but power prices vaulted to their
highest level of 2002. So did demand, as Westerners cranked up their
cooling systems.</LD>
<LD>   The crew that balances supply and demand on most of California's
electrical transmission system struggled to import enough power from
neighboring states as temperatures hit 92 degrees in Portland and 108
in Phoenix.</LD>
<TE>   "We are stepping up our call for conservation," said Stephanie
McCorkle, spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator.
"Consumers will really help us if they avoid using the heavy
electrical appliances now through Thursday. Temperatures are only
going to increase tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Temperatures hit 87 degrees in downtown Los Angeles, 81 in Santa
Maria and 108 in Palm Springs. The hottest weather in California was
recorded in Needles, where the temperature rose to 113.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, normally relatively cool this time of year,
temperatures reached 90 and it wasn't just the tourists wearing
shorts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like Hawaii!" Betsy Castillo said in the downtown financial
district. "This is the first day all year I didn't have to leave home
with a sweater or a jacket."</TE>
<TE>   The power emergency forced Cal-ISO to lower a federal price cap on
electricity that applies across the West. Some warned that lower
prices could discourage electricity sales to California in coming hot
days.</TE>
<TE>   Cal-ISO declared a Stage 1 emergency--the first since July 3,
2001--when power reserves fell below a 7% buffer. In such a
situation, businesses that have agreed to curtail consumption are
asked to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for electricity hit 41,838 megawatts at 3:25 p.m., the
highest peak consumption of the year. And the unexpected shutdown
Monday night of power plants that could produce 2,700 megawatts of
power--enough to supply 2 million homes--compounded Cal-ISO's
problem. Tension returned to its control room in Folsom, east of
Sacramento, where workers had struggled daily in the winter of
2000-2001 to avoid blackouts.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 5,000 megawatts of power plant capacity was down Tuesday
for planned or unexpected maintenance, more than twice the usual
amount for summer. (A megawatt-hour is roughly enough electricity to
supply 750 homes for an hour.)</TE>
<TE>   The hobbled power plants included a 700-megawatt unit owned by
Mirant Energy in Pittsburg, near San Francisco Bay. A broken pump
kept the unit running at half of capacity, said Mirant spokesman
Patrick Dorinson.</TE>
<TE>   Another nearby unit capable of producing 150 megawatts was shut
down, he said, because PG&amp;E has yet to fix circuit breakers in the
switching yard that carries electricity away.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything else is available and running," Dorinson said of
Mirant's power plants in the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento at the Department of Water Resources, which has been
buying electricity for three financially troubled utilities since
January 2001, long-term contracts allowed power buyers to remain
calm.</TE>
<TE>   The DWR's tens of billions of dollars in long-term contracts,
criticized by many as overly expensive and inflexible, provided such
a great margin of supply Tuesday that the agency sold up to 700
megawatts of excess power to other California suppliers, said DWR
spokesman Oscar Hidalgo.</TE>
<TE>   The agency buys power for 27 million people served by Pacific Gas
&amp; Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric.</TE>
<TE>   "We prepared ourselves for hot weather," Hidalgo said. "This is
why it's important to hedge yourself against the volatility of the
market. Today we're not exposed so fully as we were a year ago to
these types of up and down swings in the market."</TE>
<TE>   McCorkle said the DWR's sales probably helped offset the megawatts
lost when power plants shut down unexpectedly.</TE>
<TE>   Electricity prices jumped Tuesday to $68 per megawatt-hour and
higher, from a $30 range just a week ago.</TE>
<TE>   But even the higher prices stayed below the $92 per megawatt-hour
price cap imposed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in a
June 2001 order that was intended to stabilize California's erratic
power market.</TE>
<TE>   That order, however, dictated that the price cap would be reset
whenever California power supplies slipped below a 7% margin for more
than an hour. The Stage 1 emergency, declared at 2:40 p.m., lasted
until 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The new price has been set at $57.14 per megawatt-hour, said
McCorkle.</TE>
<TE>   Under the federal order, California power plant owners must supply
electricity to Cal-ISO if it is available and needed. But the new,
lower price cap could discourage power producers from releasing water
from reservoirs or buying natural gas to run more power plants, said
Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum.</TE>
<TE>   "That means Northwest sellers will be more dicey about selling
into California than ever before," he said. "It will re-create the
chaos we had in December 2000. I wish them well with their price
caps, because it's really not helping California."</TE>
<TE>   Hot weather is expected to stick around through the week, with
temperatures in the 70s at the coast, the upper 80s inland and into
the 100s in the valleys and deserts, said Jeremy Nelson, a
meteorologist with Weather Central Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson said a high-pressure system sitting in north-central
California, combined with winds blowing offshore, has created the
high temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. used the tight

failed to get a handle on the power crisis that led to blackouts in
the winter of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "With warm weather expected to continue for the next 36 to 48
hours, the state's power grid will continue to be pushed to the
limit, and Gray Davis' inability to lead will be exposed," said a
statement from the Simon campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Davis campaign spokesman Roger Salazar responded by saying that if
California had followed Simon's advice to let consumers pay more for
power, "we would have had a summer full of blackouts last year."</TE>

<HD>State Is Hit With Power Emergency</HD>
<DH>Electricity: Several generating plants interrupt service
amid rising temperatures, but blackouts are avoided. Energy prices
soar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL and KELLY YAMANOUCHI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Searing heat across the West and an unusually high number of power
plant shutdowns forced California to declare an electricity supply
emergency Tuesday and drove power prices to their highest level of
the year.</LD>
<LD>   No blackouts were triggered, but California grid operators lowered
the price cap on power.</LD>
<LD>   It was a move that generators warned could discourage electricity
sales to California in coming hot days.</LD>
<TE>   With temperatures hitting 92 degrees in Portland, Ore., and 108 in
Phoenix, the crew responsible for the last-minute balancing of supply
and demand on most of California's electrical transmission system
struggled to import enough power from other states.</TE>
<TE>   "We are stepping up our call for conservation," said Stephanie
McCorkle, spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator.
"Consumers will really help us if they avoid using the heavy
electrical appliances now through Thursday. Temperatures are only
going to increase tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Temperatures hit 87 degrees in downtown Los Angeles, 81 in Santa
Maria and 108 in Palm Springs. The hottest weather in California was
recorded in Needles, where the temperature rose to 113.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, where temperatures reached 90, it wasn't just
the tourists wearing shorts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like Hawaii!" Betsy Castillo said in the downtown financial
district. "This is the first day all year I didn't have to leave home
with a sweater or a jacket."</TE>
<TE>   Cal-ISO declared a stage one emergency--for the first time since
July 3, 2001--when state power reserves fell below a 7% buffer.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for electricity hit 41,838 megawatts at 3:25 p.m., the
highest peak consumption of the year. That, plus the unexpected
shutdown Monday night of power plants that together could produce
2,700 megawatts of power--enough to supply 2 million homes--revisited
the Cal-ISO control room in Folsom with the sort of tension that grid
operators had hoped to put behind them after California's electricity
market calmed and prices fell in June 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 5,000 megawatts of power plant capacity was shut down
Tuesday for planned or unexpected maintenance, more than twice the
usual amount for summer. (A megawatt-hour is roughly enough
electricity to supply 750 homes for an hour.)</TE>
<TE>   The hobbled power plants included a 700-megawatt unit owned by
Mirant Energy in Pittsburg, near San Francisco Bay. A broken pump
kept the generating unit running at half of capacity, said Mirant
spokesman Patrick Dorinson.</TE>
<TE>   Another nearby unit capable of producing 150 megawatts was shut
down, he said, because PG&amp;E has yet to fix circuit breakers in the
switching yard that carries electricity away.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything else is available and running," Dorinson said of
Mirant's power plants in the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   At the Sacramento power-buying headquarters of the Department of
Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for three
financially troubled utilities since January 2001, long-term
contracts allowed power buyers to remain calm and cool.</TE>
<TE>   The DWR's portfolio of tens of billions of dollars' worth of
long-term contracts, criticized by many as overly expensive and
inflexible, provided such a great margin of supply Tuesday that the
agency sold up to 700 megawatts of excess power to other California
suppliers, said DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo.</TE>
<TE>   The agency buys power for 27 million people served by Pacific Gas
&amp; Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric.</TE>
<TE>   "We prepared ourselves for hot weather," he said. "This is why
it's important to hedge yourself against the volatility of the
market. Today we're not exposed so fully as we were a year ago to
these types of up and down swings in the market."</TE>
<TE>   McCorkle said the DWR's sales probably helped offset the megawatts
lost when power plants shut down unexpectedly.</TE>
<TE>   Electricity prices jumped Tuesday to $68 per megawatt-hour and
higher, from a $30 range just a week ago.</TE>
<TE>   But even the higher prices stayed below a $92 per megawatt-hour
price cap imposed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in a
June 2001 order that was intended to stabilize California's erratic
power market.</TE>
<TE>   That federal order, however, dictated that the price cap would be
reset whenever California power supplies slipped below a 7% margin
for more than an hour.</TE>
<TE>   The stage one emergency declared by Cal-ISO at 2:40 p.m. lasted
until 7 p.m.--long enough to trigger a recalculation of the federal
price cap on wholesale power. The new price has been set at $57.14
per megawatt-hour, said McCorkle.</TE>
<TE>   Under the federal order, California power plant owners must supply
electricity to Cal-ISO if it is available and the supply is needed.
But the new, lower price cap could discourage power producers from
releasing water from reservoirs or buying natural gas to run more
power plants, said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western
Power Trading Forum.</TE>
<TE>   "That means Northwest sellers will be more dicey about selling
into California than ever before," he said. "It will recreate the
chaos we had in December 2000. I wish them well with their price
caps, because it's really not helping California."</TE>
<TE>   Hot weather is expected to stick around through the week, with
temperatures in the 70s at the coast, the upper 80s inland and into
the 100s in the valleys and deserts, said Jeremy Nelson, a
meteorologist with Weather Central Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson said a high-pressure system sitting in north-central
California, combined with winds blowing offshore, has created the
high temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. used the tight
power supplies to attack Gov. Gray Davis, saying the governor has
failed to get a handle on the power crisis that led to blackouts in
the winter of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "With warm weather expected to continue for the next 36 to 48
hours, the state's power grid will continue to be pushed to the
limit, and Gray Davis' inability to lead will be exposed," said a
statement from the Simon campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Davis campaign spokesman Roger Salazar responded by saying that if
California had followed Simon's advice to let consumers pay more for
power, "we would have had a summer full of blackouts last year."</TE>

<HD>M. Pynoos, 84; Civic Booster, Engineer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He laid out a prewar airfield, designed the first nail gun to help
Howard Hughes make the Spruce Goose, built the historic One Wilshire
building and created a glass-walled art center to celebrate "60 Years
of Living Architecture" next to the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed house
in Barnsdall Park.</LD>
<LD>   He also dreamed up computerized corporate carpooling, funded
research into major eye diseases and persuaded artists such as David
Hockney to contribute art to benefit the Los Angeles Children's
Museum.</LD>
<LD>   Morris S. Pynoos, the engineer, contractor, philanthropist, art
collector and civic booster known as "Morry" to friends and readers
of the late Times columnist Jack Smith, died Friday at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center of congestive heart failure. He was 84.</LD>
<TE>   A native New Yorker, he came to Los Angeles with his family when
he was 5, delivered produce for his father's Depression-era grocery
store, graduated from Fremont High at 16 and earned a civil
engineering degree from UC Berkeley in 1939.</TE>
<TE>   Involved in U.S. defense efforts before World War II, he laid out
the airfield at Inyokern, which became the China Lake Naval Weapons
Center. During the war, he worked as an aeronautical engineer at
Curtis Wright, Lockheed and Hughes Aircraft, helping to design the
XP-55 Ascender, the giant C-46 Cargo Transport and the experimental
photo reconnaissance XF-11 aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Pynoos designed the now-ubiquitous nail gun specifically for
Howard Hughes' famous Spruce Goose. The wooden fuselage was nailed
together and glued, and then the nails were removed. According to his
son Robert, Pynoos knew the huge aircraft would get off the
ground--which it did, once--but said it could never be properly
maneuvered aloft.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, the engineer formed Morris S. Pynoos Co. to build
innovative custom homes and other structures by well-known
architects, including Wright and Paul Williams. He built many
showplace homes in the 1950s with free-standing, movable and glass
walls, as well as the Barnsdall Park Art Center.</TE>
<TE>   Pynoos became intrigued with quake-resistant construction
techniques when his family home remained the only one in his
neighborhood left standing after the 1933 Long Beach earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   As president of Rockwin Prestress Concrete Corp. in partnership
with Winthrop Rockefeller in the 1950s, he developed prestress
concrete--casting concrete around steel cables stretched by hydraulic
jacks that were released as the concrete hardened. The material
proved useful in fabricating wide-span beams, floors and bridges.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, Pynoos, as vice president of S. Jon Kreedman Co.,
built the 31-story One Wilshire in downtown Los Angeles, the first
city skyscraper taller than the previous earthquake-safety height
limit of 13 stories. The construction incorporated the latest
technology in seismic joints and rockers to withstand shaking.</TE>
<TE>   In 1966, as chief of staff for the Westwood Village Development
Co., Pynoos helped renovate the commercial area adjacent to UCLA and
encouraged the addition of movie theaters and high-end shops to
attract consumers. He helped persuade federal officials to add a
Westwood exit to the San Diego Freeway to increase traffic to the
area.</TE>
<TE>   Pynoos also built a number of bank buildings, including the United
California Bank in Beverly Hills and more than a dozen American
Savings banks throughout California. Later, he moved into owning and
managing commercial and apartment complexes as a partner in P and M
Realty and Century Development.</TE>
<TE>   In 1962, Pynoos conceived a corporate carpooling plan he called
"Community Auto Rides" to reduce air pollution and crowded downtown
Los Angeles traffic.</TE>
<TE>   His idea, ahead of its time, has become commonplace with the
development of more sophisticated computers and corporate incentives
to employees.</TE>
<TE>   Pynoos' interest in nurturing children led him, a lifelong tennis
player, to found the Beverly Hills Youth Tennis Foundation providing
lessons to underprivileged children from such luminaries as Arthur
Ashe.</TE>
<TE>   He was also a longtime board member and president of the Los
Angeles Children's Museum, supervising its growth in the Civic Center
Mall and sowing seeds for the effort to build a larger facility. He
also distributed 3,000 tickets to children who had never been to the
Hollywood Bowl so they could enjoy a special 1985 museum benefit
celebrating the 30th anniversary of Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   Pynoos was on the board of trustees of the Berkeley Foundation and
Sproul Associates at UC Berkeley, a member of the Chancellor
Associates at UCLA, and a trustee of the New School for Social
Research in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   When his son Jon developed a corneal disease called keratoconus in
1970, Pynoos and his wife, Rita, established the Discovery Fund for
Eye Research, which he headed for 30 years. Pynoos also founded the
National Keratoconus Foundation, raising millions of dollars for
research on eye diseases.</TE>
<TE>   An avid art collector, Pynoos befriended such artists as Hockney,
Willem de Kooning and Louise Nevelson, and, by arranging for a De
Kooning to be loaned to the White House, also became a friend of Bill
and Hillary Rodham Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Morris and Rita Pynoos sponsored "The White House
Collection of American Arts" exhibition at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife of 61 years and two sons, Pynoos is
survived by two sisters, Miriam Winner and Charlotte Sherman; and six
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral services are planned at 2 p.m. today at Hillside Memorial
Park and Mortuary.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that, in lieu of flowers, memorial
contributions be made to the National Keratoconus Foundation, 8733
Beverly Blvd., Suite 201, Los Angeles, CA 90048.</TE>

<HD>Westsiders Could Use the Pied Piper</HD>
<DH>Health: Arid conditions and urban sprawl drive rats into
pricey enclaves. County campaign educates residents on how to deal
with pests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZANTO PEABODY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Those Westside rats have gone too far this time, moving into tony,
ivy-adorned homes and dining al fresco in sidewalk cafes. Campaigns
are afoot to get rid of them.</LD>
<LD>   Arid conditions and the march of urban sprawl into hillsides have
driven rodents from their dens throughout Los Angeles County while
lush greenery, water and good eating have drawn them into some pricey
locales.</LD>
<LD>   "Rodents do not know they've crossed Santa Monica Boulevard into
Beverly Hills and shouldn't be there," said Terrence Powell, county
director of environmental services.</LD>
<TE>   On the contrary, from the rats' point of view, rats should be
there.</TE>
<TE>   "Rats love palm trees, too. To them, they're classy, high-rise
condos," Powell said. "Utility lines are their highways to get from
place to place."</TE>
<TE>   Call it a Southern California trade-off. People plop beautiful
homes right next to nature, and nature settles in.</TE>
<TE>   In fairness, eateries and homes throughout the county have had
problems with rats and mice. But health officials are now paying
closer attention to the Westside because they have been getting more
complaints there in recent months, said Frank Hall, county chief of
vector management.</TE>
<TE>   In April and May alone, the county health department temporarily
closed seven restaurants on Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade for
rodent problems, sometimes in alleys, sometimes in the outdoor dining
areas. Some of the sidewalk cafes there were built without what
planners call "mouse-blocking dams," architectural features that
guide rodents away from key areas. And alleys provide ideal channels
for bar-hopping rats.</TE>
<TE>   The drought has dried up some of the rodents' wild food sources,
so they have become more adventurous.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think there has been a rise in the rodent population,"
said Hall, whose department also monitors mosquitoes and bees. "But
they are getting so brave that people are seeing them more."</TE>
<TE>   Ivy and shrubs make good cover for rats awaiting nightfall, and
so-called green belts prevail on the far Westside.</TE>
<TE>   "In higher socioeconomic areas, rodents can survive forever and
not be seen," Hall said.</TE>
<TE>   But some rodents are seen.</TE>
<TE>   Residents at the Malibu Bella Mar apartment complex pay as much a
$5,000 a month for luxury units on a hill on the coastal side of the
Santa Monica Mountains. Tenant Jan Miller said she won't go into her
kitchen anymore after seeing a rat "parading" in front of her at a
computer desk. Other tenants recalled a man who awoke with a rat
crawling across his arm.</TE>
<TE>   Miller had plenty of contact with wildlife when she lived in
Northern California, but was in for a surprise when she moved to the
Westside.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent most of my life in Mill Valley," said Miller. "And I've
had raccoons and rats come in the house. You just call a good
exterminator, and they get rid of them. But these rats are still
here."</TE>
<TE>   Now she sleeps with a towel under her door to keep rats out.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Palisades was the setting for a video shot to educate
county environmental services employees about what happens when
rodents are left to breed like, well, rodents. A manicured yard
bespoke elegance outside an expensive home. When health officials
stepped inside, they were nearly overrun by rats. They trapped more
than 250 before they stopped counting.</TE>
<TE>   As county officials shot the video, an unusually bold rat entered
through an open window, jumped onto the kitchen table and drank water
from a bowl before hopping back out the window.</TE>
<TE>   "The moral to the story is rats will go anywhere they have food,"
Powell said. "It's ironic that many of the things they like are on
the street of the very affluent."</TE>
<TE>   Powell said three-quarters of homes in Pacific Palisades have had
or will have rats.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Klopper, a Pacific Palisades resident, has organized her
neighbors to fight the rodents, mostly by spreading the county's
advice to thin out landscaping and put away pet food. Klopper
admitted that lifting the silence was difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "I wondered, 'How could people know this exists and not do
anything?' " Klopper said. "People didn't want to talk about it, and
they would say they didn't have rats, but you knew they did."</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, a Westside rat is really the same as an
Eastside rat, a species known as the roof rat and distinguished by
its long tail and climbing ability. Grace Shin, a Los Angeles County
senior environmental health specialist, said many people mistake them
for squirrels.</TE>
<TE>   To help control the rat population, the county inspects 65,000
buildings annually. Shin recommends that residents leave poisoning to
the professionals and suggests other remedies, along with traditional
traps:</TE>
<TE>   * Get rid of inoperable vehicles or debris.</TE>
<TE>   * Raise woodpiles 18 inches off the ground.</TE>
<TE>   * Remove brown fronds from palm trees.</TE>
<TE>   * Maintain screens on foundation vents.</TE>
<TE>   * Remove fallen fruit.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing to do as a homeowner is to not believe the
misconception that your home has to be filthy to have rats," Shin
said. "Totally eliminating them is impossible. We can't prevent them
from coming in our yards, but we can stop them from breeding and
feeding in our homes."</TE>

<LD>A Huntington Beach woman vacationing in France was crushed to death
over the weekend by an oncoming train after getting out on the wrong
side of her train at a station, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Dana Staller, 22, had been traveling from Bayonne to Hendaye with
her 18-year-old sister, and mistakenly got out on the wrong side of
the car, police and rescue officials said. French passenger trains
have doors on both sides.</LD>
<LD>   As Staller stepped onto the tracks at 6:10 p.m. Sunday, she was
hit by a train that did not stop at the Hendaye-Plage station.</LD>

<HD>Council to Study LAX Shooting Response</HD>
<DH>Violence: Agencies will report on their reaction amid calls
to merge airport police, LAPD.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>City Councilman Jack Weiss called Tuesday for a report within two
weeks on how police, firefighters and airport officials responded to
the fatal Fourth of July shooting at Los Angeles International
Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Weiss also said he wants to explore whether the LAPD should be
merged with the airport police department, which answers to the city
agency that operates LAX. Both the airport police and the Los Angeles
Police Department operate at LAX, with the airport police working to
prevent crime there and the LAPD responding primarily when a crime
occurs.</LD>
<LD>   "We have to ask whether two divisions make sense," Weiss said.
"I'm not suggesting that anything improper was done. I'm just asking
for the city to take a fresh, independent look at this."</LD>
<TE>   The city's Emergency Preparedness Department, airport agency staff
and the LAPD will be asked to submit "after-action" reports on their
responses to the shooting. Reports on combining the police agencies
are due from the LAPD and the airport agency within two months.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation into the shooting continued Tuesday, as federal
and local law enforcement officials pursued information they hope
will explain Egyptian immigrant Hesham Mohamed Hadayet's motive for
opening fire at a ticket counter being used by El Al Airlines.
Officials are exploring several possibilities, including terrorism, a
hate crime or a random act of violence.</TE>
<TE>   There remained no indication, however, that Hadayet had
connections to terrorists or terrorist causes, a law enforcement
source said.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews with City Council members, law enforcement agencies
and security experts, most agreed that the city's response to the LAX
shooting was adequate, although some spoke of tension between the
LAPD and the FBI over which agency had jurisdiction in the criminal
investigation. The FBI typically heads airport investigations that
might involve terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Mitzi Grasso, president of the Police Protective League, said the
LAPD probably should consider taking over the airport police force.
She commended the airport police, however, for their handling of the
shooting. And she praised the cooperation among law enforcement
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything went very smoothly," she said. "The LAPD worked very
well with the airport police, with the FBI, and El Al security was
phenomenal."</TE>
<TE>   The July 4 shooting in the Tom Bradley International Terminal,
which left three dead and several wounded, led several lawmakers,
including Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), to call for increased
security in airport ticket lobbies. The federal Transportation
Security Administration, the agency charged with airport security,
said it planned before the LAX shooting to deploy its uniformed and
undercover officers throughout airports. The agency hasn't set a
deadline for deployment, however.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn will announce at an airport news conference
today that he will require the city agency that operates LAX to hire
off-duty LAPD officers to supplement airport police. LAPD officers
will be stationed at security checkpoints to free up airport police
to patrol the terminal areas.</TE>
<TE>   "The traveling public will see a very heightened armed presence in
the public terminal area," said Deputy Mayor Troy Edwards. "We want a
stronger show of force."</TE>
<TE>   Off-duty LAPD officers will remain in place until 60 airport
police officers hired since the Sept. 11 attacks report for duty in
January.</TE>
<TE>   Those personnel will supplement 240 sworn officers and 200 unarmed
security officers now patrolling LAX grounds. The LAPD now has 74
officers stationed at LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, who as recently as Friday said he didn't believe that the
airport police and the LAPD should be consolidated, supports further
study of the issue, Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Police Commission President Rick Caruso has called for a merger of
the two agencies, saying it would lead to a more efficient use of
limited city resources.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm firmly convinced, just from a citizen's point of view, it's
the right thing to do," Caruso said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't hear anyone giving me a reason why you should have two
different police forces--from a whole training standpoint there
should be one police force."</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said he has requested reports that were completed in 1998
when former Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks called for
consolidation of all of the city's law enforcement agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The council later rejected his request. Caruso hopes to bring a
proposal to merge the two police entities before the commission later
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' proposal, known as "One City--One Police Department," was
the latest in a series of debates over the last decade about whether
the airport police should be combined with the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   The organizations were nearly merged in 1992, but the plan was
delayed because of negative publicity surrounding the LAPD, according
to a white paper on the issue drafted by the city agency that
operates the airport.</TE>
<TE>   The airport police department was established in 1946 and given
full authority to patrol the airport in 1968 because the LAPD didn't
have the resources to keep an eye on the airfield and the facility's
perimeter and to hand out traffic citations, airport officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Airport police receive specialized training, including 22 weeks at
the Police Academy and an additional 23 weeks to learn Federal
Aviation Administration regulations, according to the white paper.</TE>
<TE>   Completing a merger of the two agencies won't be easy: According
to the City Charter adopted by voters in 2000, such a plan would
require an amendment to the charter and voter approval.</TE>

<HD>To Hawaii, Tahiti, Antarctica and Back--This Time Intact</HD>
<DH>Sailing: Orange Coast College's Alaska Eagle crew returns
safely to Newport. The sea gods weren't tempted with loose talk of a
certain other boat's fate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This time, the boat and its crew made it back to the mainland in one
piece.</LD>
<LD>   A year ago, high seas disabled the Bonaire, a 66-foot fiberglass
ketch, forcing a crew of Orange Coast College students and
professional sailors to abandon the boat in the middle of the Pacific
Ocean.</LD>
<LD>   But this year, the seas were much calmer and the 65-foot Alaska
Eagle was much sturdier. The Alaska Eagle's nine-member crew of
students and professionals arrived safely in Newport Harbor on
Tuesday afternoon after a 16-day journey from Honolulu.</LD>
<TE>   The Hawaii to Newport Beach trip was the final leg of the Alaska
Eagle's 27,000-mile, 12 1/2-month journey that included stops in some
of the world's most remote and exotic spots--Antarctica, Easter
Island, Pitcairn Island and Tahiti. More than 200 students took part
on the various legs.</TE>
<TE>   There was a busted transmission that had to be replaced in
Argentina and a few other minor mishaps along the way. But nothing
even came close to the collapsed mast step that the Bonaire's crew
encountered on the way back from a yacht race to Hawaii. After a few
anxious days in the middle of the Pacific, the crew hitched rides on
passing commercial ships bound for Panama.</TE>
<TE>   The Alaska Eagle crew's most harrowing experience along that same
route was a ripped sail about halfway through the 2,000-mile trip.</TE>
<TE>   "We spent the day down below sewing," said Sheree Austin-Gagne,
46, a sailing novice from Shepperton, England. "It was quite
interesting. It felt like we were in a club or something."</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the journey aboard the aluminum training sloop was
relatively uneventful. And no one seemed to be complaining.</TE>
<TE>   "Two nights ago, we had a lot of rocking and rollin' because of
some high winds," said Sheri Crane, who helped skipper the boat for
11 legs. "But mostly, the wind was pretty soft and lazy."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Dalrymple, 26, who works in the college's sailing program
with a few crew members from the Bonaire, said last summer's
ill-fated trip wasn't a hot topic aboard the Alaska Eagle.</TE>
<TE>   "We had the spot marked where they abandoned ship, and we passed
right over it," Dalrymple said. "But out of respect to the sailing
gods, it's not something you go on about."</TE>
<TE>   Crane, who has been sailing the Alaska Eagle with her husband
since it was donated to the college 20 years ago, said the Bonaire
disaster never worried her.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, you don't ever want to become complacent," she said.
"But we know this boat well, and we have a lot of confidence in it."</TE>
<TE>   For good reason. In 20 years, the Alaska Eagle has logged more
than 250,000 miles.</TE>
<TE>   "This is by far the flagship boat of the school," said Brad Avery,
the sailing school's director. "It's very well-suited to what we do.
It's outlasted some rugged seas and taught our students plenty of
seamanship skills. It's built to race around the world, and it's been
coming back for 20 years."</TE>
<TE>   When the Alaska Eagle arrived, it was escorted into the harbor by
five other boats from the school's fleet.</TE>
<TE>   Crane, who has been at sea for nearly a year, said it felt good to
be back on dry land.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to sleeping in my own bed," she said. "And
finally having some space to move around in."</TE>
<TE>   The Alaska Eagle will be busy for the rest of the summer, taking
sailing students to Santa Catalina Island, the Channel Islands and
San Francisco. In November, it will undergo six months of maintenance
work before heading to Hawaii in June 2003 as a support boat for a
transpacific yacht race. From there, it's on to Australia.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying the implementation of honors classes for ninth- and
10th-graders will lead to segregation, the principal and two
assistant administrators of Gilroy High School have resigned in
protest.</LD>
<LD>   The pilot honors program will place top students in separate
English and social studies classes, instead of mixing them with
students of all abilities.</LD>
<LD>   The administrators worry that parents of students from
Spanish-speaking homes--65% of the school's students--won't know the
classes exist and won't encourage their children to take them.</LD>
<TE>   But a group of parents, teachers and community members who pushed
for the honors program maintains that the classes will be open to all
students. They say the school's real problem is it doesn't challenge
top students.</TE>

fibers on the sheet that was found near the nude, decomposing body of
Danielle van Dam.</LD>
<LD>   Criminalist Tanya DuLaney was called by defense attorney Steven
Feldman but provided information that could help the prosecution in
Westerfield's trial on charges of kidnapping and murdering the
7-year-old, who was found in a rural area of the county on Feb. 27.
That was 25 days after she disappeared.</LD>
<LD>   Other forensic specialists have testified that Danielle's blood,

<HD>Man Pleads Not Guilty in Girlfriend's Shooting</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man accused of shooting his girlfriend several times and then
keeping her in a garage where he treated her wounds pleaded not
guilty to three felony counts.</LD>
<LD>   Christian Leroy Lindblad, 36, was charged Monday with one count
each of attempted murder, torture and false imprisonment by violence.
Lindblad remains in jail on $500,000 bail. His next court date is
July 18.</LD>
<LD>   Christina Stebbins, 35, was at Loma Linda University Medical
Center. She was shot in the abdomen, right arm and right leg on June
27 in the home she shared with Lindblad on the edge of Baldwin Lake,
a few miles east of Big Bear Lake.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said that Stebbins slept on a mattress after the
shooting, and that Lindblad treated her wounds but refused to call
for help. It wasn't until a family friend called authorities that
Stebbins was discovered.</TE>
<TE>   San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies are unsure whether
Stebbins will live. If she dies as a result of the injuries,
additional charges could be filed against Lindblad.</TE>
<TE>   "She would have survived those gunshots for sure if she had been
taken to a hospital right away," sheriff's Sgt. Bobby Dean said.
"Now, I just don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are still trying to determine the role of Lindblad's
parents, who were reportedly called by their son shortly after he
allegedly shot Stebbins. They also helped treat her, applying gauze,
soap and water and antiseptics, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   No charges have been filed against the parents, whose names were
not released.</TE>

<HD>Castration Won't Cure Sex Predator, Court Told</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Surgical castration would not make a convicted sexual predator fit
for release, a psychologist testified.</LD>
<LD>   Locked in a state mental facility, Gregory Donald Grant, 56, hopes
castration will lead to his release.</LD>
<LD>   Grant's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Lisa McCamey, said Monday
that Grant is asking the county to pay to have his testicles removed
because the anti-androgen drugs, which he had been taking to
"chemically castrate" himself, have been affecting his health.</LD>
<TE>   Gabrielle Paladino, who has been treating Grant at Atascadero
State Hospital, testified that surgical castration would not make
Grant safe for release. In 1983, Grant was sentenced to 29 years in
prison for kidnapping, forcibly molesting and sexually assaulting an
8-year-old boy in a motel.</TE>
<TE>   The testimony follows a decision by a Ventura County jury Monday
not to release another sexual predator, Stephen Norten, who had
already had himself castrated.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A brush fire of unknown origin charred about 100 acres near a launch
pad where the space shuttle was once supposed to take off.</LD>
<LD>   Monday's fire, located on the remote southern shoreline of the
base, burned grass just north of an area that was charred in late
June.</LD>
<LD>   The June blaze burned 7,782 acres on the Sudden Ranch property,
close to the Point Arguello Coast Guard Lifeboat Rescue Station.</LD>
<TE>   A base spokesman had no information on how close the flames came
to the Space Launch Complex 6, also known as "Slick Six," which is
undergoing an estimated $120-million renovation.</TE>
<TE>   The pad, a fixture on the base since the 1960s, was first
developed for the proposed Manned Orbiting Laboratory, which never
got off the ground. It later was modified to be the home of the West
Coast space shuttle program, but that venture was canceled after the
Challenger explosion in 1986.</TE>

<HD>Union Disputes Cost of Policing New Valley City</HD>
<DH>Secession: Official says the Sheriff's Department
mismanages its budget and would be unlikely to keep to savings
estimate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stepping up its campaign against San Fernando Valley secession, the
Los Angeles police union criticized the county Sheriff's Department
on Tuesday as a mismanaged agency that cannot meet a budget and
therefore is in no position to take over policing of a new city.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to Valley cityhood campaign leader Richard Katz,
Police Protective League President Mitzi Grasso went on the attack
against the Sheriff's Department, which once estimated that it could
police the Valley for $100 million less than it costs the LAPD.</LD>
<LD>   Grasso noted that the Sheriff's Department last year faced a
shortfall of $25.3 million in its budget of about $1.5 billion.</LD>
<TE>   "Current county budget negotiations have revealed a department
that either continually underbids actual cost for service or
seriously mismanages its allocated budget," Grasso wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In his own letter, Katz responded: "It's too bad that
fearmongering passes as business as usual with the downtown power
elite."</TE>
<TE>   Grasso said the Sheriff's Department has repeatedly come under
fire for wasteful spending.</TE>
<TE>   "The Sheriff's Department can't operate within its budget
today--the public shouldn't expect them to fulfill their promises
tomorrow," Grasso wrote to Katz, who co-chairs the San Fernando
Valley Independence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders view the union's attack on the Sheriff's
Department as misguided.</TE>
<TE>   They are hoping to work out a contract with the Los Angeles Police
Department to continue policing the Valley, though bringing in the
Sheriff's Department remains an option.</TE>
<TE>   "No one has made any commitment," Katz said.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders have said another option would be for a Valley
city to form a police department.</TE>
<TE>   "[The police union is] choosing to discredit the Sheriff's
Department and that is unfortunate, because both agencies have jobs
to do," Katz said.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Capt. Ray Leyva said the criticism is unfounded.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not so much that we are over budget, it's that we are being
underfunded," Leyva said. "They [the police union] are doing what
they have to do to keep their department in place, and we are a good
target."</TE>
<TE>   Leyva said the estimated $100 million in savings was not part of
an official proposal or study, but was based on what the department
spends serving 32 contract cities that, if combined, equal the
Valley's population of 1.35 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not done a comprehensive study," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Grasso, in her letter to Katz, accused secession leaders of
misinforming the public by claiming that police services would
improve without tax increases after the breakup of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We ask that you cease your barrage of promises and untruths on
this issue, and instead give residents the real picture of what
policing post-secession will be like: an incomplete force and a
bigger financial burden," Grasso wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Katz responded that the Valley still has not gotten a sixth police
station promised more than 10 years ago and gets only half the police
protection received by the rest of the city.</TE>
<TE>   "We are confident that police protection in the Valley and
throughout Los Angeles will only be improved under an independent
city government, and hope that you will stop using manipulative scare
tactics to deceive the public."</TE>

<DH>Politics: The GOP candidate would spend $400 million. Aides
to Gov. Davis say some of the ideas are already being implemented.</DH>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. laid out a
$400-million plan Tuesday to strengthen California's homeland defense
with a proposal that echoes President Bush's emphasis on improving
the training and equipment of police officers, firefighters and
emergency personnel.</LD>
<LD>   Saying Democratic Gov. Gray Davis has not done enough to sharpen
the skills of the state's first line of response, Simon proposed
requiring terrorism awareness training for all emergency workers and
upgrading their equipment to cope with new weapons.</LD>
<LD>   "Local public safety agents must be outfitted with the tools that
are needed to respond to a biological, chemical or even nuclear
attack," Simon said during a 30-minute lunchtime speech to a group of
San Diego civic leaders. "It is they who are on the front lines of
our war against terrorism, and we need to ensure that they are
prepared for the battles of the future."</LD>
<TE>   Aides to Davis called the GOP candidate's ideas redundant. Many of
the items listed in Simon's plan have already been implemented, and
the others will be rolled out after the state receives its share of
federal money for homeland security, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's ill informed, or he hasn't looked into this issue deeply,"
said the governor's security advisor, George Vinson. "To be frank,
this is more of a press release than a plan."</TE>
<TE>   Vinson said he and other law enforcement officials have been
working on a strategic plan for California for the last six months.
He added that many of the state's current procedures have been copied
by federal officials as they design the Office of Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   Simon noted that the state has yet to submit a proposal to the
federal government for California's share of the $3.5 billion that
Bush has earmarked to help state and local governments improve their
security and emergency responses.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the president said he wants that money to be spent on
equipment for local rescue personnel, as well as training to deal
with chemical and biological attacks. Vinson said the state's
proposal, which is due by July 31, will be submitted soon.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's plan, which an aide said was crafted with input from White
House officials, is designed to maximize the amount of money
California will get to enhance its emergency response and protection,
the candidate said.</TE>
<TE>   More than half of the $400-million plan would be financed with
that federal money, Simon said. The remainder would come from state
funds, although he did not specify how he would cover those costs at
a time when the state faces a $23.6-billion deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said Tuesday that he would fill the state's funding gap by
cutting spending instead of raising taxes, but he has not laid out a
specific budget plan to cover all of the shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe public safety is a priority," he told reporters after
his speech. "And I believe that in a $100-billion budget, there has
got to be room for the expenditures that will be necessary to
implement my plan."</TE>
<TE>   Several of Simon's proposals have already been put in place by the
state, including the development of a curriculum to train emergency
workers, the creation of a stockpile of equipment and medical
supplies, and a cabinet-level office to coordinate emergency
responses.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor's plan is in action; he doesn't have to produce a
piece of paper," said Davis campaign strategist Garry South.
"Obviously, this was put together by somebody who doesn't understand
what the government is doing right now."</TE>
<TE>   The Republican candidate also proposed recruiting a volunteer
corps of citizens and building a database of their skills so they
could assist in cases of emergency. He said he would also create
three specially trained National Guard battalions that could be
deployed quickly to serve as police at scenes of terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "It might not be possible to prevent all future attacks," Simon
said. "This makes our thorough preparations all the more imperative.
We must plan now so that if the time does come--God forbid--we can
respond to any threat, overwhelm any attacker and direct successful
rescue efforts."</TE>

<HD>Infant's Body Found in Trash</HD>
<DH>Crime: Newborn discovered in Carson is the fifth abandoned
in L.A. County in a month, and the third to die.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINA L. ESPARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The discovery of an infant's body Tuesday morning at a Carson
recycling center marks the fifth abandoned newborn in the county in
four weeks and the third death, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Workers found the newborn about 5 a.m. while separating trash on a
conveyor belt at Quality Paper and Fiber Inc. in the 19200 block of
Figueroa Street, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Scott
Butler. The coroner's office expects to have the baby's age and a
cause of death within the week.</LD>
<LD>   This is the third child to have been found at a waste or recycling
plant in a month.</LD>
<TE>   One week ago Tuesday, the body of an infant girl was found at Best
Way Recycling in Walnut Park. On June 10, another body of a newborn
girl was found on a conveyer belt at Athens Disposal Services in the
City of Industry.</TE>
<TE>   On June 13, an infant was found bloody and naked outside a
Panorama City apartment, and another was left on a downtown Los
Angeles apartment doorstep on June 30.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's disgusting," said Deputy Richard Weston. "There's a
safe haven program in effect. People can bring the baby to any fire
station, any hospital, any clinic.... Nobody seems to be taking
advantage of this law."</TE>
<TE>   California's "safe haven" law states that a woman can leave her
child at a hospital, clinic or fire station within 72 hours of birth
with no questions asked and no fear of prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   However, more children have been discarded in the county than
safely surrendered since the law's implementation last year,
according to the Safe Haven for Abandoned Newborns Task Force, a
group committed to preventing child abandonment.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen infants were found abandoned last year, 11 of whom died,
said Yolie Flores Aguilar, co-chairwoman of the task force. None of
the 14 was left at safe havens.</TE>
<TE>   This year, nine babies have been abandoned, two were surrendered
to safe havens and three were found dead.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very distressing," Flores Aguilar said. "Every time I hear
about another baby, my heart just sinks."</TE>
<TE>   The task force, which began functioning in February, has conducted
surveys and compiled statistics to find out why infants were being
abandoned, and found three common denominators: fear, denial and lack
of support.</TE>
<TE>   "All of these women were in denial or concealed their pregnancy,"
Flores Aguilar said.</TE>
<TE>   Often, these mothers believed they would shame their families, or
were women who already had children and did not have the means to
care for another.</TE>
<TE>   The task force's report revealed that the mothers of discarded
children do not fit in any one race, class, marital status or age.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people tend to think that only young girls and minorities"
abandon their babies, said Pamela Booth, head deputy district
attorney for her agency's family violence division.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no consistency in race, ethnicity, age.... It's across
the board."</TE>
<TE>   Most cases of child abandonment are not brought to trial, but
instead are settled, Booth said. Punishment ranges from probation to
25 years to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   In cases where a mother stabs, smothers or hits a baby until it
dies, she faces a life sentence. Those who leave their babies in
precarious situations that lead to death--such as dumping an infant
in a trash bin--can face as much as a six-year sentence, Booth said.</TE>
<TE>   If the mother is a minor, however, she could be charged as a
juvenile and may face time in a group home or a California Youth
Authority camp until age 25.</TE>

<HD>Woman, 48, to Be Charged With Vandalism of Pasadena Chapel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 48-year-old Sierra Madre woman is scheduled to be arraigned today
on charges that she vandalized a Pasadena Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints chapel, causing at least $30,000 in damage,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to commercial burglary and felony vandalism charges,
Barbara Knieriem will be charged with committing a hate crime, said
Pasadena Police Department spokeswoman Janet Pope.</LD>
<LD>   About 10 a.m. Monday, a worker painting a shed behind the chapel
saw a person with a hatchet break a glass door, he said, according to
Bruce McGregor, a church spokesman. The workman ran to a nearby
business to call police.</LD>
<TE>   Several organ pipes were damaged, the main doors smashed,
paintings slashed, a piano was destroyed and there were hatchet marks
on the walls, McGregor said.</TE>
<TE>   Knieriem also apparently took a water hose into the chapel and
flooded a room, police said.</TE>
<TE>   She turned herself in at the Sierra Madre police station.</TE>
<TE>   Knieriem is being held in lieu of $50,000 bail. Pope said Knieriem
made statements that she used to be involved with the church, but
"didn't like them anymore."</TE>

<HD>Virk 'Overwhelmed' by Abuse, Doctor Testifies</HD>
<DH>Court: The psychiatrist says the woman, charged with trying
to drown her two children, was severely depressed because of her
husband.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Testifying for the defense Tuesday, a psychiatrist said that Narinder
Virk was depressed and tormented by years of spousal abuse on the
night she allegedly tried to drown her two young children.</LD>
<LD>   "She had severe depression. This was someone who was overwhelmed,"
said Dr. Sarabjit Sandhu, a Newport Beach-based psychiatrist. "It was
related to the relationship with her husband. She had been verbally
and physically abused."</LD>
<LD>   Sandhu's testimony came as Virk's attorney, Cynthia Ellington,
continued to insist that Virk was mentally incompetent the night of
the incident and prosecutors pressed defense witnesses on their
testimony.</LD>
<TE>   Virk, 42, is charged with two counts of attempted murder for
allegedly trying to drown her 6-year-old daughter and 9-year-old son
in January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   An Indian immigrant, Virk has pleaded not guilty by reason of
insanity.</TE>
<TE>   Prosectors have argued that Virk, jealous and out for revenge and
a desire to punish her husband, pushed her two children off a boat
dock at Channel Islands Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   She was arrested after an Oxnard resident pulled the fully clothed
woman and children from the water.</TE>
<TE>   Ellington has said that Virk suffered a severe mental breakdown
after her then-husband, Port Hueneme liquor store owner Santokh Virk,
deserted the family and returned to India.</TE>
<TE>   Barely able to speak English and unable to read or write, Narinder
Virk was left penniless with two young children.</TE>
<TE>   Sandhu, hired by Ellington to testify in the case, said he met
Virk shortly after she was incarcerated at Ventura County Jail
following her arrest.</TE>
<TE>   She was suspicious of his questions at first, he said. But Sandhu,
who spoke to Virk in her native Punjabi, said she slowly opened up to
describe years of abuse at the hands of her husband.</TE>
<TE>   "The final straw was that he was gone again and there was no way
to know when he would return," Sandhu said. "She could not cope or
function any more."</TE>
<TE>   Under cross-examination by Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard
Simon, Sandhu acknowledged that Virk had not sought treatment for her
depression and was not taking any prescription medication.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors have testified that screaming matches between Virk and
her husband were common. Witnesses have testified that Santokh Virk
was verbally abusive to his wife in front of their children. They
also said Narinder Virk had often complained about a tortured
marriage but said divorce was out of the question because of strict
cultural values.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Tuesday, an audio-visual expert testified that a tape of
an interview district attorney's investigators conducted with the
couple's son backed up Narinder Virk's allegations of physical abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Although the sound on the reconditioned audiotape of the interview
is garbled, a transcript provided to the court stated that the
couple's son, Sonny, said that "my mom and dad fight and he hits
her."</TE>
<TE>   The sound of hands clapping is then heard on the tape, simulating
a slap.</TE>
<TE>   After Simon inquired about fees for his testimony, the expert,
Gregg M. Stutchman of Napa, said he is being paid $150 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Both Sonny and his sister, Harpreet, testified earlier in the
trial that they never saw their father physically assault their
mother.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, however, a neighbor testified that Harpreet once told
her that she saw her father hit her mother.</TE>
<TE>   The children now live with their father in Port Hueneme. Ellington
has tried to show that the children were coached by law enforcement
officials.</TE>

<LD>Trustees for the Ventura County Community College District will hold
a closed-door meeting Tuesday to discuss the future of Chancellor
Philip Westin, who has come under fire for his spending on car
repairs, computer equipment and high-priced meals.</LD>
<LD>   Westin's critics said the meeting will provide trustees with an
opportunity to reassert their authority over an administrator who,
they contend, has operated without appropriate oversight.</LD>
<LD>   "They could pussyfoot around, but I hope they don't do that," said
Hank Lacayo, a longtime Democratic Party and Latino rights activist.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a moral issue here and an image that this group is
portraying to the rest of the community and the kids attending the
colleges. Mr. Westin should go."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Miller, president of the Ventura County Federation of
College Teachers, a union long at odds with the chancellor, also
urged trustees to remove Westin.</TE>
<TE>   Art Hernandez, vice president of the five-member board of
trustees, said he called the special meeting to give trustees an
opportunity to reevaluate their May decision renewing Westin's
contract through 2006 at an annual salary of $203,000.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm looking for is for all of us to have a discussion in
regards to the district leadership," Hernandez said Tuesday. "It's
going to have a very serious tone."</TE>
<TE>   Westin's contract guarantees him a $305,000 buyout if board
members force him to resign.</TE>
<TE>   Westin did not return phone calls Tuesday seeking comment but has
said repeatedly he will not step down. Westin has not been invited to
the meeting, which will be closed to the public because it involves a
personnel matter. The public, however, will have a chance to speak on
the topic before the 7 p.m. session at district headquarters, 333
Skyway Drive, in Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   The chancellor came under fire in March, when the Camarillo law
firm of Wood &amp; Bender presented trustees with a report detailing
$119,000 in expenses the chancellor accrued over four years on such
items as meals, computer software and automobile maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   In talks with trustees and in a complaint to the State Bar of
California, the chancellor accused one of the law firm's partners,
David Bender, of retaliating because Westin had declined to steer
legal work his way.</TE>
<TE>   Bender has declined repeated requests for interviews. His partner,
David Wood, maintains the firm did nothing improper, and the state
bar has declined to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   Trustees initially sought Westin's resignation but dropped those
efforts after an auditor hired by the district cleared him of any
criminal wrongdoing. At the time, Tallman complained the audit was
not thorough enough.</TE>
<TE>   In May, trustees voted 4 to 1 to renew Westin's contract and raise
his salary 16%, saying Westin had performed a good job and was
instrumental in securing approval of a $356-million construction
bond.</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayer advocates, faculty and union members and dozens of
residents assailed the board over its about-face. Fueled by reports
of restaurant meals and a $130 BMW detailing, more than 100
protesters packed a board meeting last month demanding that trustees
remove the chancellor.</TE>

<TE>   Larry Miller, president of the Ventura County Federation of

urged trustees to remove Westin.</TE>
<TE>   "If anybody on that board has political ambitions, they'd better
see to it that Westin resigns or is fired," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Art Hernandez, vice president of the five-member board of
trustees, said he called the special meeting to give trustees an
opportunity to reevaluate their May decision renewing Westin's
contract through 2006 at an annual salary of $203,000.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm looking for is for all of us to have a discussion in

<TE>   Westin's contract guarantees him a $305,000 buyout if board
members force him to resign.</TE>
<TE>   Trustee John Tallman, the only board member to vote against the
new contract, said he would like the board to authorize an
independent, detailed audit of Westin's expenditures since he became
chancellor in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Westin did not return phone calls seeking comment but has said
repeatedly he will not step down. Westin has not been invited to the

protesters packed a board meeting last month demanding that trustees
remove the chancellor.</TE>
<TE>   Lacayo and community activist David Maron have started an e-mail
campaign to oust Westin, and a conservative Republican group is
seeking to recall trustee Allan Jacobs, who is not up for reelection
until 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, Tallman and board President Norman Nagel face
reelection in November. Trustee Bob Gonzales, whose term is up in
2004, has said he does not intend to run again. He has not been
targeted for recall.</TE>
<TE>   Westin has set new limits on his meal expenses, and trustees have
vowed to impose stricter spending guidelines and oversight, but a
majority of the board has stood behind the chancellor.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, however, said he acted hastily when he cast his vote in
May and that he and his colleagues should not be afraid to reconsider
their decision.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the board's right and responsibility to look at the
chancellor any time they want to, even a month after they renew his
contract," Hernandez said. "That's what people want."</TE>

<LD>There's an undeservedly obscure Hollywood film called "The Solid Gold
Cadillac," which shows up now and again on some cable-movie channel.
It is a fairy tale of corporate America that for its time--1956--was
satirically sharp, and of course the whole thing winds up with Judy
Holliday and Paul Douglas living happily ever after on honorably
earned stock dividends.</LD>
<LD>   If you get the chance, see it. Its lineage is Michael Moore out of
Norman Rockwell, and it's more instructive of American values than a
social studies class: a fable about how little people triumph over
grotesquely overpaid corporate officers, and go on to run an American
company strictly on the up-and-up, as if it were a church bake sale,
and everyone prospers.</LD>
<LD>   That's how you know it's a fable. Out here, beyond the soundstage
door, the little people don't triumph. They get scythed down by the
Charles Keatings and Ken Lays, the Enrons and Global Crossings and
WorldComs, the chaff of some CEO's hit-and-run harvest.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, as what Kevin Phillips calls the era's "politics of
resentment" stood behind him and gave him a nudge, President Bush
spoke on Wall Street about corporate responsibility. For the benefit
of anyone who hit the "mute" button, the screen behind Bush bore the
words "corporate responsibility" about a hundred times over, as if
some naughty CEO had been forced to write them on the board, which is
more punishment than most offenders of that ilk seem to get.</TE>
<TE>   It was a speech with far more "shoulds" than "wills." Even so, I
heard the Wall Street audience interrupt it with applause only once.
They were probably furtively dialing their cell phones, telling their
human relations officers to hurry out to hardware stores and junior
high schools to find some old Eagle Scouts to put on their boards
now, or calling their lawyers to find out whether Aruba has an
extradition treaty with the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   How was this new set of rules--or more often suggestions--playing
among the people who already play by the rules? To find out, I
checked out the trenches of Bungalow Heaven, small-town,
small-business South Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Garbe's father opened this jewelry business in 1946, in the
flush years just after the war, when engagement rings were as much in
demand as bungalows and then baby carriages would soon be.</TE>
<TE>   Garbe took it over from his father in 1982. It is a small shop on
South Fair Oaks Avenue, in a well-tended strip mall opposite a
thriving gourmet market. Five and sometimes six days a week, he sits
with a loupe screwed onto his eye, monocle-like, repairing watches,
mending bracelets, making rings, maybe resetting some of the same
stones his father sold.</TE>
<TE>   He also spends a good bit of time on his books, the fiscal
inventories, the business taxes, the employee forms, getting it all
to the accountant on time and in good order. All the reports of high
crimes among the high and mighty is mighty annoying to a man who
knows he has to account for every nickel and every gram of gold that
crosses the counter. "Something's got to be done about that stuff. I
can't do that in my own business--I've got to abide by the laws, so
they should too."</TE>
<TE>   More than that, though, it's personal. He rode out one stock
market mess in the late 1960s and again in the late 1980s, but "this
is the worst I've ever been through.... I've had so many of these
stocks myself that have gone almost belly up or way, way down ...
even the good stuff like AT&amp;T, considered a blue-chip stock."</TE>
<TE>   When even the big ones like Enron fall, or get shoved down the
stairs by their own leaders, "a person doesn't know what to do, and
you depend on these stocks to supply your retirement," Garbe says.
"In my case it's not that far off, and now I don't have enough to
retire, so I'm going to have to work more."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Never mind all the slip-sliding tactics that Bush didn't cite,
like offshore tax havens for CEOs. Most astonishing were the
"shoulds," reforms Bush mentioned that are, amazingly, not already in
the law. Most of us have to sign more blood oaths to get a credit
card than these people evidently have to do to run a Fortune 500
corporation.</TE>
<TE>   People who serve on committees that audit companies, nominate
directors and recommend how much they get paid aren't already barred
from fiscal relationships with the corporation?</TE>
<TE>   Bigwigs can trade in the company stock during periods when their
employees can't?</TE>
<TE>   Corporate officers who get rich from false accounting statements
aren't already required to give up all the dough they get from that?</TE>
<TE>   Executives guilty of fraud aren't already banned from just jumping
to the board of some other company and fleecing a new flock? (Sounds
like the Catholic Church's shell game of moving around its troubling
molester-priests.)</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Garbe belongs to the local Rotary, and is wary of anything
that sounds like "more big government," which some of Bush's
proposals did to him, but it has to be done, he sighs. "I don't know
where all this money's coming from. We have this homeland defense
stuff and armed forces and now this."</TE>
<TE>   But here's a small businessman's idea about financing the posse to
ride herd on big business, a new spin on "paying for your crimes."</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe if they have stock listed, a percentage should go to pay
for that [enforcement]. It's not our fault these guys are crooks."</TE>

<LD>Arnold Schwarzenegger praised the Home Depot National Training Center
in Carson for being "a facility of inclusion" during the Tuesday news
conference called to formally announce a 10-year, $70-million naming
rights deal.</LD>
<LD>   Sorting through the list of possible organizations and events the
85-acre, $130-million center can include is a significant part of the
decisions still in front of Anschutz Entertainment Group President
Tim Leiweke before the center's scheduled June 2003 opening on the
campus of Cal State Dominguez Hills.</LD>
<LD>   Another round of options was raised Tuesday. AVP beach volleyball
Commissioner Leonard Armato confirmed he will resume discussions with
Leiweke next week regarding the center's availability for use as AVP
headquarters, training facility and site of a tour event that could
include international players.</LD>
<TE>   "I would assume AEG would think this is a great fit, given that
beach volleyball is an Olympic sport the U.S. is successful in [gold
medals in 1996 and 2000], and that the sport traces its origins to
Southern California ... ," Armato said.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke said he is in negotiations to bring international soccer
matches to the center, which will be equipped with a 27,000-seat
soccer stadium and five training fields. The center also is set to be
the home of a WUSA team should leaders of the struggling women's
soccer league choose to expand to the Los Angeles market.</TE>
<TE>   USA Track and Field President Craig Masback said his organization
has committed to adding the center as a stop on its Golden Spike Tour
that includes elite events such as the Millrose Games in New York and
Prefontaine Classic in Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke repeated his intention to bring the International Assn. of
Athletics Federations world championships and World Cup of track and
field to the center's 30,000-seat track stadium within 10 years. He
also promised USA Cycling Chief Executive Gerard Bisceglia that the
center's velodrome will play host to cycling's World Cup and world
championships.</TE>
<TE>   "You kids, this is your home, and we'll bring it here," Leiweke
said to a group of U.S. Olympians who attended the ceremony. He
added, "I'm not sure how much saying that just cost us."</TE>
<TE>   AEG sources have estimated another $100 million will be required
to secure the kind of events they intend to bring to the center.</TE>

<LD>   What: "The Ultimate Blooper Collection From 25 Years of 'This Week
in Baseball' "</LD>
<LD>   Price: $14.95 (VHS), $19.95 (DVD).</LD>
<TE>   A good baseball blooper, much like a "Three Stooges" episode,
never gets old, which makes this video worth watching.</TE>
<TE>   The expected bloopers are featured--the ball that bounced off Jose
Canseco's head for a home run, Steve Lyons dropping his pants at
first base--but there are many other less memorable plays that are
just as funny.</TE>
<TE>   In a segment titled "When Bloopers Go Good," Paul O'Neill, then
with the Cincinnati Reds, bobbles a ball on a hit to right field with
the potential winning run at second base. Thinking he has blown the
play, O'Neill angrily kicks the ball. His 30-yard boot amazingly goes
right to the first baseman, keeping the runner at third.</TE>
<TE>   The video, from Major League Baseball Productions, also has a
segment on baseball pranks. In one of the more hilarious ones,
Toronto Blue Jay teammates of Derek Bell get hold of his customized
truck and bring it out to the field, announcing to the crowd that one
lucky fan will drive away with the vehicle. Bell's expression is
priceless.</TE>
<TE>   There are special features on three of the game's biggest
characters--Mark Fidrych, Jose Lima and Tom Lasorda. The DVD version
also has bloopers from each season and other outtakes worth watching.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>From the front page of the Los Angeles Times on November 23, 1908,
after Barney Oldfield had set a world record of 55 seconds for the
mile:</LD>
<LD>   "Barney Oldfield's attempt to commit suicide at Agricultural Park
[now Exposition Park] yesterday only resulted in a compound fracture
of the world's automobile record.</LD>
<LD>   "It would seem simpler and easier for him to hire someone to brain
him with an ax than suffer this lingering destruction.</LD>
<TE>   "It looked this way: a flash of white shirt down the back stretch,
a dark streak on the horizon across the fields, a cloud of dust far
up the track, and before you could lean over the rail to see, a
rushing mighty wind swashing by under the wire and everybody
beginning to shout. That is what it was like to see Barney Oldfield
do a mile in 0.55."</TE>
<TE>   They don't write 'em like that any more.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the only NFL player picked first in two
drafts?</TE>
<TE>   High praise: Atlanta Brave pitcher Greg Maddux, on slugging
outfielder Vladimir Guerrero of the Montreal Expos: "I'm just as
terrified of him now as I was when he came up. I feel a lot better
about walking him now than I did when he came up, if that means
anything."</TE>
<TE>   Fair warning: Steve Hummer of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,
commenting on Serena Williams being followed by a stalker at
Wimbledon:</TE>
<TE>   "How silly it is to get worked up about some pitiful little man
stalking Serena Williams. If he actually tried to approach her, by
the time Serena and the rest of the family got through with the guy,
there wouldn't be enough left of him to mail to jail."</TE>
<TE>   Ouch! The New York Yankees, headed by Jason Giambi, have been on a
home run hitting surge, prompting Matt Crossman to write in the
Sporting News, "They've got more homers than the referees' locker
room at Laker games."</TE>
<TE>   What's important? When Hall of Fame second baseman Bill Mazeroski
broke into baseball, he was not much of a hitter, but a Pittsburgh
Pirate official told a sportswriter, "Mazeroski is a clean-cut,
churchgoing youngster who is a model for all teenagers."</TE>
<TE>   To which the writer replied, "That may be true, but the Pirates
might be better off with a juvenile delinquent who can hit."</TE>
<TE>   The new world: There is no shame in not embracing soccer, says
Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason our forefathers left England was to find livelier
alternatives to warm beer, cricket, soccer and pub darts," he wrote.
"And we found 'em: Cold beer, baseball, football and Shaq free
throws."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Tony Boselli, by the Jacksonville Jaguars from USC
in the college draft, then by the Houston Texans from Jacksonville in
the expansion draft.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Gary Player, who won nine majors before embarking on
the senior golf tour, couldn't believe what he'd heard after Phil
Mickelson said he was pleased to have had a good week when he
finished second to Tiger Woods in the U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you imagine being happy about finishing second?" Player said.
"The only person who remembers if you finish second is your wife and
dog. And that's if you have a good wife and dog."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Police plan to recommend that prosecutors issue a warrant for the
arrest of Allen Iverson of the Philadelphia 76ers for allegedly
barging into an apartment and threatening two men while armed.</LD>
<LD>   District Attorney Lynne Abraham's office will be asked today to
approve charges of aggravated assault and making terroristic threats
while armed, Philadelphia Police Lt. Michael Chitwood said Tuesday
night.</LD>
<LD>   The 76ers issued a statement late Tuesday night, saying the team
had been advised that "charges are imminent."</LD>
<TE>   Iverson, 27, had a gun when he forced his way inside an apartment
July 3 and threatened two men, one of the men, Charles Jones Jr.,
said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson, accompanied by another man, reportedly went to an
apartment complex before dawn to look for Iverson's wife, Tawanna,
and cousin, Shaun Bowman, who lives there. Neither was there, said
Jones, who has lived in the apartment since March.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said Iverson had a black handgun but did not brandish it.</TE>

<HD>A's Reach Pact With Coliseum</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Oakland Athletics extended their lease at the Coliseum through
2007 on Tuesday, securing the team's short-term future and likely
pushing it further down the list of candidates for contraction.</LD>
<LD>   Owner Steve Schott remains committed to building a baseball-only
stadium in the East Bay for the A's, but he reached another
compromise in his team's stormy relationship with its government
landlords at the Coliseum, their home since 1968.</LD>
<LD>   "We've put the A's in position to stay and play baseball at the
Coliseum while we look at sites for a new stadium," Schott said. "Now
the real work begins."</LD>
<TE>   With their relatively small fan base and outmoded stadium, the A's
were thought to be among the second tier of candidates for the
contraction favored by Commissioner Bud Selig.</TE>
<TE>   The A's will pay $500,000 annually in rent over the first three
years of the agreement, with increases to $550,000 in 2006 and
$600,000 in 2007.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Mariner shortstop Carlos Guillen pleaded not guilty at
Kirkland, Wash., to a charge of drunken driving.</TE>
<TE>   Guillen, 26, was arrested early in the morning June 13 by police
in suburban Clyde Hill, east of Seattle, after being stopped for
speeding. Police said he was clocked at 89 mph in a 60-mph zone.</TE>
<TE>   Officers said a portable breath test showed Guillen's
blood-alcohol level was .093. The state's legal limit is .08.
Portable breath tests are not admissible in court.</TE>
<TE>   Guillen refused to take a breath test at the Clyde Hill police
station. On Tuesday, Municipal Court Judge Albert Raines granted a
request by Guillen's lawyer, Douglas Cowan, to have evidence of that
refusal suppressed.</TE>
<TE>   Cowan said Guillen, from Venezuela, did not fully understand what
officers asked him to do when he was arrested. Guillen speaks limited
English. Cowan said Guillen tried to reach a teammate or lawyer for
advice after his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   A translator was in court to translate the proceedings for
Guillen.</TE>

<LD>Neither Tribal Rule nor Timely Action has won a stakes race, but it
seems only a matter of time for each.</LD>
<LD>   The talented sprinters will collide today at Hollywood Park in the
day's seventh race, a $51,000 optional claimer at six furlongs.</LD>
<LD>   Tribal Rule, a 6-year-old son of Storm Cat owned and bred by Marty
and Pam Wygod and trained by Julio Canani, will be making only his
fourth start today.</LD>
<TE>   Second in his only race as a 4-year-old, Tribal Rule was perfect
in two dominant performances at Del Mar last summer, beating maidens
by eight lengths in 1:08 4/5, then winning an allowance by five
lengths in 1:09 flat.</TE>
<TE>   A leg injury sent him to the sidelines, but he has trained as if
he'll pick up where he left off. Three of his last four drills have
been best-of-the-morning workouts, one a 59 flat five-eighths of a
mile a week ago. If all goes well, the Breeders' Cup Sprint is the
ultimate goal for Tribal Rule.</TE>
<TE>   Timely Action, beaten four times at odds of 5-1, 13-10, 7-2 and
5-1 as a 2-year-old, has returned as a more relaxed, professional
thoroughbred this year for owner-breeder Herman Sarkowsky.</TE>
<TE>   He beat maidens by five lengths on May 18, then was even more
impressive in his first race against winners, winning by four lengths
in 1:22 1/5 for the seven furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fifth is a one-mile turf race for 3-year-old
fillies and features the improving Casual Queen and likely favorite
Fair Bianca, who figures to move up on the grass for trainer Paco
Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Alex Solis. At 25%, the jockey has the highest winning
percentage of any rider in Hollywood Park's top 10.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Frank Kirby. The trainer has lost with 39 of 41
starters at Arlington Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A place pick all using Paint Me Quick and
Segovia in the first, Sequoian and World Light in the second,
singling La Bella Reina in the third and Sainte Maxime in the fourth,
using Casual Queen and Fair Bianca in the fifth, singling Pam In The
Gym in the sixth and Tribal Rule in the seventh and using Monroe
Doctrine and Golden Hours in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/144. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $14.20/$826. Total money bet: $928.</TE>

<HD>Konerko Knocks Their Sox Off</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>It didn't happen in Los Angeles, but Paul Konerko has rebounded from
the frustrations he experienced with the Dodgers to fulfill
expectations with the Chicago White Sox. His All-Star selection in
the midst of a monster season--.328 average, 20 homers, 71
RBIs--served as another measure of how far he has come since leaving
the Dodgers in a 1998 trade for Jeff Shaw.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know if it validates my career," Konerko said of the
All-Star selection. "A lot of guys have played their whole career and
never made an All-Star game. Personally, winning the division and
World Series, that's making it to me.</LD>
<LD>   "I mean, going to the All-Star game is cool and definitely an
honor, but I hope people look at what you do on the field and I hope
they look at what you do as a teammate. That's what it's about, not
winning awards and going to the All-Star game."</LD>
<TE>   As a teammate and leader, Konerko has also stepped up in an
All-Star manner. On Sunday, when a slumping Frank Thomas, pouting
over a weekend of benchings, arrived late at Comiskey Park, Konerko
laid a big hurt on the Big Hurt, branding him a failure as a
teammate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like Frank is a lost cause," Konerko said before
Tuesday's game. "He's basically a good guy with a big heart, but it
was an incident I felt strongly about. I would hope teammates would
jump on me in the same way if there was a reason. It shows they
care."</TE>
<TE>   Konerko was the minor league player of the year at Albuquerque in
1997, hitting 37 homers and driving in 127 runs, but an inability to
find a regular position in Los Angeles compounded the pressure of
high expectations.</TE>
<TE>   With a contending team, interim general manager Tom Lasorda dealt
him to Cincinnati for the needed closer in Shaw, and it wasn't until
the Reds traded him to Chicago (for Mike Cameron) at the end of that
season that he found a home.</TE>
<TE>   "I never doubted my ability to produce at this level," Konerko
said of his time with the Dodgers. "I just wondered if I'd ever get
the chance, the opportunity to settle into a regular situation. A lot
of guys get caught up in a numbers game, but it's worked out great."</TE>

<HD>Blatter Communicates Firing Pretty Well</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wielding the ax for the second time since being reelected president
of FIFA, Joseph "Sepp" Blatter has fired Keith Cooper, the
organization's communications director, a man respected and well
liked by the international soccer media.</LD>
<LD>   No reason for Cooper's dismissal was given. Blatter had his new
right-hand man, acting general secretary Urs Linsi, deliver the news,
rather than face Cooper himself.</LD>
<LD>   "I was called in by the acting general secretary--not the
president, whom I have known for almost 30 years, but who was unable
to tell me himself--and told I was being dismissed [immediately],"
Cooper told England's Guardian newspaper.</LD>
<TE>   "It was really quite brutal."</TE>
<TE>   Cooper had been FIFA's communications director for seven years and
had established a good working relationship with the media. As
comfortable in German or French as in English, he had an easy rapport
with newsmen that made him perfect for the sometimes politically
tricky position.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a huge shock and a bit difficult for me to understand,
coming just two weeks after the World Cup, the most successful media
operation of any sports event in history," Cooper told the Guardian.</TE>
<TE>   "I have done the job since January 1995 and it's the only job in
the world I wanted to do. I asked the reason and was told there was
no reason."</TE>
<TE>   Cooper, who will be paid through the duration of his contract,
which expires at the end of the year, is the second key figure fired
by Blatter since his reelection June 29.</TE>
<TE>   Almost immediately after winning a second term, Blatter dismissed
Michel Zen-Ruffinen as the organization's general secretary. During
Blatter's reelection campaign, Zen-Ruffinen had been vocal about
corruption and financial wrongdoing within soccer's world governing
body.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper had remained neutral in that campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to keep out of all the political infighting and I thought
I had been successful in that," Cooper said. "But apparently other
people do not share that view."</TE>
<TE>   Markus Siegler, a spokesman for Blatter, told Bloomberg News the
firings were part of a restructuring of FIFA's headquarters staff
that Blatter promised during the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an internal thing," Siegler said. "There are reasons, of
course."</TE>
<TE>   Mathis Faces Surgery</TE>
<TE>   Clint Mathis, the United States World Cup team striker whose
Mohawk hairdo has survived a return to Major League Soccer, will
undergo arthroscopic surgery on his right knee July 17 to remove torn
cartilage, the New York/New Jersey MetroStars announced Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Mathis was injured during the MetroStars' victory over the Crew in
Columbus, Ohio, Saturday and underwent an MRI in Los Angeles Tuesday
morning. Bert Mendelbaum, the U.S. team doctor, said Mathis has both
a torn cartilage and a sprained ligament in the right knee.</TE>
<TE>   The striker will be sidelined for three to five weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Asian Games Draw</TE>
<TE>   International soccer will return to South Korea when the port city
of Busan plays host to the Asian Games Sept. 27-Oct. 13.</TE>
<TE>   The draw for the tournament produced the following groups for
first-round play:</TE>
<TE>   Group A: South Korea, Malaysia, Maldives, Oman.</TE>
<TE>   Group B: United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, Yemen, Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   Group C: China, India, Bangladesh, Turkmenistan.</TE>
<TE>   Group D: Japan, Uzbekistan, Bahrain, Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Group E: Iran, Qatar, Lebanon, Mongolia.</TE>
<TE>   Group F: Kuwait, Tajikistan, Hong Kong, Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The women's tournament will feature China, Japan, South Korea,
Taiwan and Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Play for Pay</TE>
<TE>   With smaller clubs struggling financially to keep up with the
bigger teams, some are resorting to innovative ways to keep costs
down while remaining competitive.</TE>
<TE>   Aberdeen, of Scotland's Premier League, announced that it would
institute a performance-related wage system for its players, rather
than guaranteeing them a fixed income.</TE>
<TE>   "Less and less money will be guaranteed for players, with more
[money] depending on if they are in the squad, in the team, results,
crowd levels and league position," Stewart Milne, the club's
chairman, told the Scottish Daily Mail.</TE>
<TE>   Hiddink, the Stamp</TE>
<TE>   South Korea apparently can't get enough of its World Cup players
and their former coach, Dutchman Guus Hiddink.</TE>
<TE>   Korean postal authorities say they plan to issue a series of 24
stamps featuring Hiddink and the 23 players from the team that
finished fourth in the world, the best performance by any Asian
nation.</TE>
<TE>   Fund for Late Referee</TE>
<TE>   The Federacion Mexicana de Futbol, Mexico's soccer federation, has
established a trust fund to help the family of referee Edgar Ulises
Rangel, who died in an accident July 5 when the sports utility
vehicle he was driving overturned on a highway between Mexico City
and Acapulco.</TE>
<TE>   Rangel, 38, a FIFA referee since 1997, leaves behind a wife and
four children. He was en route to a Mexican national professional
referees' convention when the accident occurred.</TE>

<HD>Tracy's Story Is No Longer Novel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Dodger Manager Jim Tracy reveled in his first All-Star game
experience as a member of the National League coaching staff, saying
it was even better than he could have imagined.</LD>
<LD>   And Tracy, credited with reestablishing the club's focus after
years of turmoil, said he was especially pleased because his peers
believe the Dodgers are finally back on track.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm proud to represent the Dodgers, and I'm proud to represent
the team that we're putting on the field right now," he said. "But
you know what's really special? You really get a sense for the fact
that there's a genuine respect out there for our club.</LD>
<TE>   "Early on, I think they thought it was a very novel situation.
Now, they've come to grips with the fact that we're 90 games in here.
This isn't an accident anymore. We're a good club."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers lead the NL West by 2 1/2 games and open the second
half with a four-game series against the second-place Arizona
Diamondbacks at Dodger Stadium. Tracy is eager to get back to
business.</TE>
<TE>   "The other day, I was telling my wife [Debra] that I am having so
much fun with this, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to be here,
but I really miss my guys," he said. "I can't wait to get back in the
dugout. They are such a special bunch."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger General Manager Dan Evans continued trade discussions while
in Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Evans hopes to provide Tracy with bench and bullpen help, and
there's a slim chance a bigger deal for New York Met second baseman
Roberto Alomar, a future Hall of Famer, could materialize. Texas
Ranger infielder Frank Catalanotto and reliever Todd Jones of the
Colorado Rockies are on the Dodgers' list.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left fielder Garret Anderson and Manager Mike Scioscia, serving as
a coach, were the only Angels on the American League squad, despite
the club's strong first-half performance in the West.</TE>
<TE>   The second-place Angels trail the Seattle Mariners by three games,
but Anderson is not surprised several of his teammates were
overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disappointing, but it's not an indication of what we've done
this year as a team," he said. "There's always going to be some
people who get left off the roster, and I've been part of that for a
few years. This year, I was fortunate enough to put up numbers across
the board, which gave me a great chance to be a reserve."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson believes playing on the West Coast is a factor in
All-Star selections.</TE>
<TE>   "You just don't have the same exposure," he said. "You watch ESPN
and national TV stations, you see a lot of what happens on the East
Coast because that's where those stations are based.</TE>
<TE>   "We just go unnoticed because of lack of exposure. There are a lot
of guys on the West Coast who are putting up the same numbers, if not
better numbers, than guys on the East Coast."</TE>
<TE>   Said Scioscia: "There's definitely more than one All-Star on our
club. We know that for sure."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rick Down, the New York Yankee batting instructor, was runner-up
for the job Tracy got in 2000. Down, the Dodger hitting coach for two
seasons under Davey Johnson, left the organization after Tracy was
hired, joining the Boston Red Sox in 2001 and the Yankees this
season.</TE>
<TE>   Down said he is pleased for Tracy, whom he spoke with before the
game, and is not surprised by the Dodgers' success. And he is not
bitter about finishing second to Tracy, believing things usually work
out for the best.</TE>
<TE>   "It was close; it probably came down to Jimmy and myself," he
said. "But there's no reason for me to want anything but the best for
that organization. There are still a lot of people I talk with
there."</TE>
<TE>   Down, who still hopes to manage, said Tracy's performance could
open doors for others without previous managerial experience.</TE>
<TE>   "He's done a great job and I'm happy for him," he said. "If the
opportunity comes, great. If it doesn't, I'm in a great situation
where I'm at now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger right fielder Shawn Green, participating in his second
All-Star game, said few probably expected him to be here earlier this
season.</TE>
<TE>   Green was in long slump and criticized for everything from his
defensive positioning to laid-back demeanor. But he stayed the
course, which led him to Miller Park as a reserve.</TE>
<TE>   "I know how this game works," he said. "I understand that when
you're doing well, everyone wants to be right there around you. When
you're struggling, everyone wants to write you off. My teammates,
coaches, friends and family have always been right there.</TE>
<TE>   "I can understand why people were upset when I was struggling. But
I really don't pay attention to how people react to how I play. If
you do, you'll just go crazy. It would be foolish of me to expect
more from people, and I'm not going to apologize when I'm doing the
best I can."</TE>

<HD>Armstrong Waits Patiently to Make His Move</HD>
<DH>Cycling: Three-time winner is comfortably in fifth place
with mountains looming next week. Zabel takes lead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEITH RICHBURG</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>There have been three stages and the yellow leader's jersey twice has
changed hands. There has been excitement with some last-minute
sprinting duels. But so far, the Tour de France's overall favorite
and three-time defending champion, Lance Armstrong, has yet to make
his move.</LD>
<LD>   Armstrong ended Tuesday's stage, at Reims in Northeastern France,
comfortably in fifth place overall. And Armstrong's U.S. Postal
Service team is content to protect him by riding near the front of
the pack.</LD>
<LD>   That could change soon. Today, the Tour moves through France's
picturesque champagne region, starting in Epernay, home to some of
the world's best-known champagne houses. The route winds through
vineyards before ending in Chateau-Thierry, where Joan of Arc lived.
The course will include a demanding team trial--the first chance for
U.S. Postal, and Spanish opponent ONCE, to face off.</LD>
<TE>   Tuesday, however, belonged to the sprinters. Erik Zabel, a German
who is a longtime sprint leader, claimed the yellow jersey from
Switzerland's Rubens Bertogliati, who held it for three days. And the
stage was won by Australian Robbie McEwen of Lotto-Adecco, after a
last-minute dash to the finish.</TE>
<TE>   The last time McEwen won a Tour stage was at the finish in Paris
three years ago. After Tuesday's win, he said: "the greatest day in
my career was on the Champs-Elysee in 1999, but this is my best win
this season."</TE>
<TE>   Zabel, who finished second but still beat McEwen by eight seconds
overall, was equally content. "This is a great day for me and my
team," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The yellow jersey has now switched from Armstrong, who won
Saturday's prologue in Luxembourg, to Bertogliati to Zabel. And
following the pattern set in previous tours, Armstrong has been
content to stay at the front of the pack in these early stages,
conserving his energy and building points until the Tour reaches the
mountains, where he dominates.</TE>
<TE>   This year's Tour, shorter than in the past, will see two grueling
mountain stretches, the first when it enters the Pyrenees for two
days July 18, and then the Alps for three days starting July 23.</TE>
<TE>   Because last year the mountain stages came early in the race and
Armstrong emerged far ahead of the pack, critics complained that
there was little suspense left for the remaining week of the Tour. So
this time the race emerges from the Alps only three days before the
finale on the Champs-Elysee, meaning the outcome could be in doubt
longer than in the past.</TE>
<TE>   There will also be a tough individual time trial July 27.</TE>
<TE>   Few cycling observers doubt Armstrong can win his fourth
consecutive Tour, particularly after his chief competitor, Jan
Ullrich, was sidelined by a knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mario Cipollini, citing bitterness at not being invited to the
Tour de France this year as one of the reasons, has decided to retire
from cycling, according to a statement released late Tuesday on his
official Web site.</TE>
<TE>   The 35-year-old Italian is enjoying one of his most successful
seasons as he won six stages of the Giro d'Italia and the Milan-San
Remo classic and the Gand-Wevelgem race.</TE>
<TE>   Cipollini cited "the bitterness of not being able to compete for
victory," and frustration with his team sponsors to explain what
"leads me to take this drastic decision to say enough with cycling."</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear if Cipollini planned to retire immediately or
after the racing season.</TE>

<TE>   Highlights from the third stage of the Tour de France:</TE>
<TE>   STAGE: A 108.19-mile run from Metz to Reims.</TE>
<TE>   WINNER: Australia's Robbie McEwen, of Lotto, in 4 hours, 13
minutes, 17 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   HOW OTHERS FARED: Telekom rider Erik Zabel of Germany was second
and took the overall leader's yellow jersey. Defending champion Lance
Armstrong was 33rd, dropping to fifth overall.</TE>
<TE>   QUOTE OF THE DAY: "We're going to leave the champagne tonight for
the coaching staff of Telekom, out of respect for tomorrow's team
time trial. No champagne for me tonight." -- Zabel, on reluctance to
celebrate too much just yet.</TE>
<TE>   NEXT STAGE: A 41.85-mile team time trial.</TE>

<HD>Sports and Hollywood Work for the ESPYs</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The movie business began in New York shortly after the turn of the
20th century, but within 10 years filmmakers realized that Southern
California had the climate and the natural scenery suited to making
movies.</LD>
<LD>   ESPN began its ESPY Awards show in New York in 1993, and now,
after a stopover in Las Vegas, the king of sports television has
moved its signature event to a climate and an area more to its
liking.</LD>
<LD>   The 10th ESPY Awards show will be held tonight at Hollywood's
Kodak Theatre, the new home of the Academy Awards show.</LD>
<TE>   ESPN believes that Hollywood is the perfect site for a show that
it has promoted as a marriage between sports and entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   "Since sports and entertainment have always blended so nicely,
Hollywood is a very fitting site," said ESPN president George
Bodenheimer.</TE>
<TE>   The marriage between sports and Hollywood goes back to the 1920s,
when swimmer Johnny Weissmuller parlayed Olympic gold into a starring
role as Tarzan.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the cross-over has been nonstop. Sports stars have
become actors, and while actors have not become sports stars, many
are sports fans.</TE>
<TE>   Sports movies are a big part of Hollywood, and unlike Westerns,
they have endured the test of time.</TE>
<TE>   "Knute Rockne--All American" was made in 1940. "The Babe Ruth
Story" starring William Bendix was made in 1948 and remade with John
Goodman in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "Bull Durham," "The Natural," and "Field of Dreams" are baseball
classics.</TE>
<TE>   "Rocky" and "Chariots of Fire" won Academy Awards as pictures of
the year.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence is everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   The man who now runs the Dodgers, Bob Daly, used to be the head of
a movie studio.</TE>
<TE>   It has become commonplace for actors to attend ballgames. Jack
Nicholson, Penny Marshall, Andy Garcia and Denzel Washington are
among the regulars at Laker games. James Garner, because of his
friendship with the team orthopedist, used to stroll the Coliseum
sideline when the Raiders played there. Doris Day was a huge Dodger
fan.</TE>
<TE>   So it's understandable that the list of entertainment celebrities
attending tonight's show is almost as long as the list of sports
celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   The host for a second consecutive year is actor Samuel L. Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The winners of the annual Arthur Ashe Courage Award were announced
Tuesday. They are Todd Beamer, Mark Bingham, Tom Burnett and Jeremy
Glick, four passengers who lost their lives Sept. 11 on United Flight
93. They were involved in forcing the plane to crash in a
Pennsylvania field rather than its intended target, and all four were
involved in sports.</TE>
<TE>   Accepting the award will be three of the widows and one mother.
There will also be a video tribute narrated by Tom Hanks.</TE>
<TE>   Today would have been Ashe's 59th birthday.</TE>

<HD>Lawyer Says Williams Asked to Be Cremated</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INVERNESS, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Ted Williams asked in his will to be cremated and have his ashes
scattered over his old fishing spots in the Florida Keys, the lawyer
for a daughter of the baseball great said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   John Heer, attorney for Bobby-Jo Ferrell, said lawyers for
Williams' estate told him about the contents of the will. Heer hadn't
seen the will.</LD>
<LD>   The daughter has accused her half brother, John Henry Williams, of
moving their father's body from a Florida funeral home to the Alcor
Life Extension Foundation in Scottsdale, Ariz., where bodies are
frozen.</LD>
<TE>   John Henry Williams has said he wants to preserve their father's
DNA, perhaps to sell it. He has not returned repeated calls seeking
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The estate lawyers planned to file the will later this week and
ask a judge to decide if Williams' body should be cremated or frozen.</TE>
<TE>   Pam Price and Bill Boyles, attorneys for Williams' estate, didn't
return phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, a former Boston Red Sox star and the last major leaguer
to hit .400 in a season, died Friday in Florida at age 83.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrell's husband, Mark, said Tuesday that John Williams first
proposed the idea of freezing the Hall of Famer's body more than a
year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Ferrell denied reports that his wife was estranged from her
father. He said she had a falling out with her half brother over what
to do with their father's body.</TE>

<HD>Unser Jr. Is Arrested on Domestic Battery Charges</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Al Unser Jr. was arrested Tuesday in Indianapolis on charges he hit a
woman in the face before leaving her on the side of a highway in the
middle of the night.</LD>
<LD>   The two-time Indianapolis 500 winner was released from the Marion
County jail after posting a $30,000 bond on preliminary misdemeanor
charges of domestic battery and domestic violence. He avoided
reporters when he left.</LD>
<LD>   The woman, Jena L. Soto, was found standing next to a guardrail on
Interstate 465 at about 3:30 a.m. Tuesday. She told police she was
Unser's girlfriend of four years.</LD>
<TE>   Soto, 38, was driving the car because Unser was drunk, she said.
She told police she hit Unser first to stop him from trying to shift
the gears, and that Unser responded by hitting her in the face.</TE>
<TE>   Unser, 40, was arrested at his motor home on the Indianapolis
Motor Speedway infield. A hearing is scheduled for July 19, Sheriff's
Col. Scott Minier said.</TE>
<TE>   The preliminary charges against Unser are each punishable by up to
a year in jail. The Marion County prosecutor's office will determine
whether to file formal charges after police submit the case for
review, Minier said.</TE>
<TE>   Soto, of Albuquerque, told police she and Unser had been at a
strip club. She said they were arguing and that he repeatedly shifted
the gears into neutral and reverse. Soto told police she pulled to
the side of the highway after Unser hit her, got out of the vehicle,
and that Unser drove away.</TE>
<TE>   Unser first denied knowing Soto, police said. After being told of
her accusations, Unser told police Soto had hit him first.</TE>

<HD>There's Tying in Baseball</HD>
<DH>All-Stars: Game is called after 11 innings in a 7-7 draw
when both teams run out of pitchers. No MVP is named.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Commissioner Bud Selig hoped the 73rd All-Star game at Miller Park
would distract baseball fans frustrated by talk of steroids and
strikes.</LD>
<LD>   The showcase at his family's new ballpark instead became another
black eye for the reeling sport he leads, as the National and
American leagues played to a bizarre 7-7, 11-inning tie Tuesday
night, angering what remained of a sellout crowd of 41,871.</LD>
<LD>   Selig instructed umpires to end the 3-hour, 29-minute game in a
tie after the NL failed to score in the bottom of the 11th, because
the 60 players on the rosters, including 19 pitchers, had been used.</LD>
<TE>   Play was delayed for about five minutes after the AL batted in the
inning while umpires huddled with Selig at his seat. Fans booed when
word emerged on TV that the game would end in a tie if the NL failed
to score.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Mariner right-hander Freddy Garcia struck out San
Francisco Giant catcher Benito Santiago to end the game, stranding
Mike Lowell of the Florida Marlins at second after a one-out single
and triggering chants of "Let them play, let them play," popularized
in one of the "Bad News Bears" movies.</TE>
<TE>   Umpires ran off the field, no most valuable player was chosen, and
fans threw trash in the outfield in an ugly scene.</TE>
<TE>   But Selig had already made up his mind, continuing the
public-relations nightmare he has experienced since taking the helm
of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the way I wanted it to end, and I'm very saddened by
it," a somber Selig said. "But this was one of those legitimate
situations where they legitimately ran out of players. I want to take
this opportunity to apologize to the fans. Obviously, there was a lot
of unhappiness, which is understood by all of us. But in the middle
of the [11th], both [AL Manager] Joe Torre and [NL Manager] Bob
Brenly came to me and said they were out of players and were out of
pitchers. They had used everybody because they wanted to get
everybody in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "It has always been the theory you use everybody. Obviously, in
your wildest dreams, you would not have conceived that this game
would have ended in a tie ... I really had no choice."</TE>
<TE>   Torre and Brenly agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel bad for Bud, especially being here, but the fact of the
matter is that Bob and I talked about this," Torre said. "To have
players come to an All-Star game, you want to get 'em in the game.
The downside is that you get 'em all in, and then it's the ninth
inning, 10th inning and 11th inning, you can't have it both ways.</TE>
<TE>   "People want to see all the stars, but you have to understand that
something like this can happen. The last thing I want to do is get a
pitcher hurt. I can't send Freddy Garcia back to [Seattle Manager]
Lou Piniella saying he can't pitch. We all regret what happened, but
there was nothing we could do."</TE>
<TE>   Brenly, guiding the NL for the first time, said Selig was in a
tough spot.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an unfortunate situation," the Arizona Diamondback manager
said. "I think it's highly improper to try to place blame on anybody
for this thing. It happened. Joe and I did the best we could to get
everybody in there, so they could showcase their All-Star talents. We
did that. Unfortunately, the game got tied up."</TE>
<TE>   The ending ruined an entertaining game.</TE>
<TE>   Giant left fielder Barry Bonds did what he does in the NL's
three-run third, hitting a line drive off a rotating billboard on the
facade of the second deck. The 385-foot liner against Toronto Blue
Jay right-hander Roy Halladay increased the NL lead to 4-0.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 5-2, in the seventh, the AL raced back behind Chicago
White Sox first baseman Paul Konerko in a four-run inning. The former
Dodger had a two-run double, matching an All-Star record with his
second double, against Arizona closer Byung-Hyun Kim, capping the
scoring and giving the AL a 6-5 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona catcher Damian Miller also had two doubles. Seven players
have hit at least that many, with Bonds last accomplishing the feat
on July 13, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The NL took the lead again, 7-6, in the seventh on a two-run
single by outfielder Lance Berkman of the Houston Astros, continuing
the back-and-forth action. Omar Vizquel, the Cleveland Indians'
smooth-fielding shortstop, pulled the AL even, 7-7, in the eighth on
a one-out, run-scoring triple against San Francisco Giant closer Robb
Nen.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of Bonds, Minnesota Twin center fielder Torii Hunter
provided the game's first highlight and lighthearted moment in the
first.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter, emerging as one of the game's best all-around players,
robbed Bonds of a solo shot with a leaping catch at the wall in
right-center after a lengthy sprint.</TE>
<TE>   "I really, for a moment, I thought it was Michael Jordan. My God,"
Chicago Cub right fielder Sammy Sosa said. "You know, that kid
impresses everybody like a superman right there, comes out from
nowhere and jumps like that and got the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, who smiled when Hunter came down with the ball, hugged
Hunter and lifted him in the air as they crossed paths behind second
base. AL and Boston Red Sox starter Derek Lowe was impressed and
appreciative.</TE>
<TE>   "I've [already] seen it so many times on TV. It was amazing," said
Lowe, who gave up two hits and a run in two innings. "I've never
pitched here before, so I had no idea where that was going to go, how
far, if it was going in the park, out of the park, and he makes a
fantastic play."</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody was speechless," said Arizona Diamondback
right-hander Curt Schilling, who started for the NL and gave up a
single in two innings. "It's always awesome in an All-Star game to
see an All-Star do what got him there. Those are the moments that
people will never forget."</TE>
<TE>   The ending certainly won't be forgotten. Players were not
surprised by the fans' reaction.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a rough reception," said Dodger right fielder Shawn Green,
who singled in three at-bats. "But I didn't really expect the fans to
start cheering when they said it would be over."</TE>
<TE>   The situation renewed the debate about expanding the 30-man
rosters. "We have to evaluate that in the future," Selig said. "Quite
frankly, maybe we have to reevaluate the usage of players as well."</TE>

<LD>   As the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network, ESPN has
grown mightily under his direction. Among his key recent
accomplishments was starting an entertainment arm to produce
made-for-TV movies and TV shows, and acquiring the broadcast rights
to the NBA for $2.4 billion. ESPN's reach extends to 150 countries.
Last month was its most-viewed June. The same was true for ESPN2,
which also had its most-viewed quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Bodenheimer, 44, was in Los Angeles for tonight's ESPY awards,
which recognize individual and team excellence in sports. The live, 6
p.m. telecast from the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood will be the first
on the West Coast after seven years in New York and two in Las Vegas.
The ESPYs have raised $24 million for cancer research in conjunction
with the V Foundation, named for Jim Valvano, the late basketball
coach. Thirty-five awards will be handed out, among them a new one
for best disabled athlete.</LD>
<TE>   Early this week, Bodenheimer sat for a wide-ranging interview on
his company:</TE>
<TE>   Question: What was behind the decision to move the ESPYs here?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: We like to move our events around at ESPN. The X Games is
a good example, and the ESPYs as well. Our presence in Los Angeles
has been increasing, what with our ownership by Disney [80% of ESPN
is owned by ABC Inc., a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Company]. We
have an ESPN Zone down in Anaheim, and the ESPYs are here. We like to
increase our West Coast presence.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do you keep the ESPYs distinctive in a landscape filled
with so many events, awards and awards shows?</TE>
<TE>   A: We think the ESPYs are unique in terms of being a blend of
sports and entertainment. You'll see as many Hollywood stars as
you'll see athletes, and that's what we think makes for a unique
show. It adds some juice to what we're doing. Many times, athletes
say they want to meet and be the entertainers, and the entertainers
say their dream is to be a professional athlete. Putting them
together makes for an entertaining evening for us.</TE>
<TE>   What we're trying to do is trying not to make this ESPN's night.
We're trying to make this an evening for the entire sports industry
to celebrate sports.... The V Foundation will again be a significant
beneficiary of the evening, and we're proud of that. It seems like
cancer has touched every family in America, and ESPN and the V
Foundation are working hard to fulfill Jim's vision to do something
about it. That's good.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do you see the ESPYs fitting in with your target audience?
And what do you consider to be your target audience?</TE>
<TE>   A: Sports fans generally, in the ages of 18 to 49, is where our
bread is buttered, so to speak. We have both younger viewers and
older beyond that. That's really our core. It's 70% male and 30%
female.</TE>
<TE>   Q: On other networks, there seems to be a trend toward sports-talk
shows that feature a lot of yelling and bullying, seemingly catering
to a young male audience. Do you see a need to do that? Is there a
place for that?</TE>
<TE>   A: At ESPN, we don't feel the need to necessarily copy anybody.
We're always trying to evolve what we do. We've been on the air
nearly 23 years, and if you look at our history over 23 years, we
have evolved our programming quite a bit. We have launched a new
group in the company, ESPN Original Entertainment, under the banner
of which the film "Season on the Brink" was produced, as well as a
hit show we have now, "Pardon the Interruption," with [Washington
Post sportswriters] Tony Kornheiser and Mike Wilbon.</TE>
<TE>   Do I think there's room for sports entertainment? Yes, I certainly
do, and ESPN is certainly headed in that direction. We certainly
don't define that as putting people on the air that yell at each
other. We've always thought of it, and we cite this often at ESPN, we
take our sports seriously but we don't take ourselves too seriously.
That's really become a company mantra that, I think, comes through to
our fans. Things like [Monday's] home run hitting contest and
[Tuesday's] All-Star game, we live for things like that. Sports is
great theater. But at the same time, we like to have fun, and I think
people tune to ESPN because they like that attitude and they like to
have fun. We try to deliver that.</TE>
<TE>   Q: In the time you've been at ESPN, there have been a number of
innovations and a good deal of evolution, the latest being the NBA
contract. How does the NBA fit in with your existing NHL contract and
with your programming in general?</TE>
<TE>   A: The NBA was a very significant acquisition for us in that when
a property like the NBA becomes available and you're in the sports
business, you work as hard as you can to acquire that. It marks a
great milestone for us and any TV network because it's the first time
any one network has had all four major professional sports under
contract at one time. We're proud of that. We think that will deliver
good diversity for our fan base. As far as hockey [goes], we're still
as committed as ever to hockey. We had a very good year this year and
ESPN enjoys a close relationship with the league office and we're
going to continue our feature presentations of hockey.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Did the NHL express concern that it might be shunted aside or
become a secondary event for you?</TE>
<TE>   A: All leagues, to their credit, work hard to serve their
interests, and hockey's no different. But no, I don't think there's
concern. In fact, the NBA provides a great promotional vehicle for
hockey.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Can viewers expect to see ESPN expand its NBA programming
beyond the game telecasts?</TE>
<TE>   A: In addition to "Inside Stuff," we're also going to be adding
pregame shows and additional analysis.... We also have the contract
for ESPN Radio. ESPN really has a multi-face to it now. We have the
largest sports radio network in the country. We broadcast NBA and
baseball games, to name two. And we have ESPN.com and ESPN The
Magazine, in addition to four TV networks [ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN Classic
and ESPNEWS]. One of the things I like about the NBA deal is, the
deal will benefit all of those media, and that's the kind of business
relationship ESPN will look for in its league partners. In effect,
there's something for every one of our businesses in this deal.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do you assess ESPN's World Cup telecasts, and do you expect
the World Cup to provide a bump for your MLS ratings?</TE>
<TE>   A: Relative to the World Cup, we were very pleased with the
ratings and the excitement the World Cup delivered. [ESPN's 24 live
telecasts reached 963,000 households, up 39% from 1998, and 34 live
telecasts on ESPN2 reached 490,000 households, up 52% from 1998.] It
was a great success and it was exciting to see the U.S. run [to the
quarterfinals], which generates the bulk of that excitement. But it
also showcased some of the fine MLS players, which I think will lead
to a bump in MLS ratings. There's clearly a growing soccer movement
in the U.S. Everyone involved in soccer would like it to be faster
and bigger, but reality is, it's growing, and the World Cup effort
will only continue to serve to support that growth.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Can you envision soccer reaching a par with the NHL or NBA or
other major sports?</TE>
<TE>   A: I would never say never about anything, but I think one thing
ESPN has demonstrated is, there is a market for fans of virtually
every sport out there. We televise roughly 65 different sports.... I
think soccer can certainly establish a foothold, no pun intended, in
this country.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Was carrying WNBA games part of the NBA deal?</TE>
<TE>   A: We've had the WNBA for six years and we just re-upped with the
WNBA as part of the most significant commitment to women's sports out
there. Between the WNBA, the women's U.S. soccer team, the LPGA and
the NCAA women's basketball tournament, which we're going to televise
all 63 games of next year, it's part of a huge commitment to women's
sports that I don't think is equaled anywhere in television.</TE>
<TE>   Q: There has been talk of a baseball strike, although players
didn't take a strike vote [Monday]. What effects would you anticipate
a baseball strike would have on ESPN in particular and baseball in
general?</TE>
<TE>   A: I would not care to speculate much on that. There are sensitive
negotiations now and, frankly, it's their business to conclude.
Obviously, we're in business to televise games, and if there are no
games, that's not a positive development. We're very hopeful players
and management will work out their differences.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Have you come up with alternative programming in case there is
a strike?</TE>
<TE>   A: No. We'll get to that if need be. Right now we're optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How have your baseball ratings been?</TE>
<TE>   A: Ratings are up. We're having a very good year with baseball.
[Ratings for Sunday and Wednesday games are up 15%, ratings for
Monday and afternoon games are up 50%, compared to the same time
period a year ago, and ESPN2's ratings are up 43%.]</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you have in mind ratings numbers you'd like to see for your
NBA games?</TE>
<TE>   A: We do, but I'm not going to cite a public number because it
will just set up an expectation. We are looking for increased ratings
and we think having the games on ESPN, which is a network devoted to
sports, will provide us a good opportunity to grow the sport.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You spoke before about the various businesses that ESPN has
gotten into. What's next?</TE>
<TE>   A: Growth through technology, perhaps video-on-demand
applications, some interactive TV applications. We're developing new
programming and adding new types of programming. [Tuesday's
announcement of a second made-for-TV movie, "The Junction Boys,"
based on a book by Jim Dent about a Bear Bryant summer football camp]
that's an example of how ESPN is evolving....</TE>
<TE>   If you look at our 23 years, we basically made ESPN what it is
today on two prongs of a stool. One is games, events. Winners,
losers, whistles, referees and stuff. The other is sports-news shows,
with our flagship "SportsCenter," then "NBA 2Night," "NHL 2Night,"
all the news shows. Now, we believe there is room for a third prong,
sports entertainment. So we formed ESPN Original Entertainment and
we're producing movies, game shows and, potentially, dramas. We know
that our fans will accept this from ESPN as long as it stays true to
our core of authentic sports.</TE>
<TE>   Q: There's also ESPN Spanish-language programming [showing
baseball, the NFL and some boxing]. What's your vision for the
eventual scope of that?</TE>
<TE>   A: ESPN Deportes is in 12 million homes, which is most of the
significant Hispanic markets in the U.S.... It's a bloc of
programming on Sunday nights, but we're looking to expand that to 24
hours, seven days a week. We haven't concluded our planning on that
but it's something we're considering.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've come a long way from the mail room.</TE>
<TE>   A: This is a great company that has a fabulous culture. ESPN is a
company marked by a can-do attitude.... You've got to remember, for a
lot of years, nobody in the mainstream media took us very seriously,
and we weren't on anybody's radar screens. We developed an esprit de
corps and just kept improving what we were doing. We knew we were
onto something because of the reaction of fans. We knew fans wanted
more and, quietly, we delivered it. We stuck to it.</TE>
<TE>   The first program on ESPN the first night we were on the air
[Sept. 7, 1979] was "SportsCenter." Now, 23 years later
"SportsCenter" is itself a brand, and it's our flagship program. It's
the daily record for sports. But there was a lot of hard work getting
there. Athletes now ask, "Is this a 'SportsCenter' highlight?" and
that's the ultimate sign of respect from athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Q: There was a flap when Dan Patrick, one of your personalities,
appeared in commercials for Coors. What is your position on that?</TE>
<TE>   A: You've got to look at opportunities on a case-by-case basis and
we make decisions that we deem are in our best interests.... We
thought it appropriate at the time, and we stand by our decision.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Has Disney's acquisition of ESPN changed the network's
operations?</TE>
<TE>   A: Disney's acquisition of ESPN has been very good for the
company. Many of our expansions have been born under the Disney
ownership. ESPN The Magazine, which is a thriving business, is
probably the best example. Disney is obviously one of the
quintessential marketing companies in the world and adding that
expertise to our brand has clearly catapulted the growth of this
company.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What happened to plans for an ESPN West?</TE>
<TE>   A: We contemplated that and ultimately decided to stick to our
knitting and stick with national networks, as opposed to regional
ones. It's complicated, launching a network. Our bread and butter is
national networks.</TE>

<HD>No Ladies Days on Augusta Calendar</HD>
<DH>Golf: Chairman Johnson doesn't react well to letter that
asks club to have women members before next year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Golf's next big rivalry, is here, although it's not what we expected.</LD>
<LD>   It's not Tiger versus Sergio, or Tiger versus Mickelson, or even
stripes versus plaids.</LD>
<LD>   It's Hootie Johnson versus the National Council of Women's
Organizations.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson, the chairman of Augusta National Golf Club, the site of
the Masters, is angry that Martha Burk, chairwoman of the women's
group, sent him a letter last month, urging him to open the club to
women members before next year's tournament, thus avoiding having
tournament sponsors associated with discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Augusta National has no official policy that excludes women, but
no women are members.</TE>
<TE>   In a three-paragraph statement released Tuesday, Johnson called
Burk's letter "coercive."</TE>
<TE>   "We do not intend to be a trophy in their display case," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson added that he would make no further comments on the issue,
predicting that women would be invited to join Augusta, but at a time
chosen by the club.</TE>
<TE>   "Not at the point of a bayonet," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Contacted in her Washington office Tuesday, Burk seemed
bewildered. She said a three-sentence letter from Johnson had been
delivered to her desk only minutes before Johnson's written statement
was released to the media.</TE>
<TE>   "I am shocked," she said. "I expected a reasonable response. What
he said to me in the letter was, 'I'm not going to talk to you.' I
think it is significant, if I think about it, that I did not release
my letter to the public. I was not looking for a public fight over
this. Johnson chose to make it that way."</TE>
<TE>   Augusta National, formed as a private club in 1932 by golf legend
Bobby Jones, invited its first black member to join the club in 1990.
Lee Elder had been the first black pro to play the Masters in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   The club, which has about 300 members, permits women to play the
course as guests. Karrie Webb and Kelly Robbins of the LPGA Tour
played the course in the spring. Johnson invited the University of
South Carolina women's team to play as his guests. Burk said she
would continue her crusade. "This is really wrong for the 21st
century," she added. "I expect at some point we will try to have some
dialogue with the [Masters tournament] sponsors, given the fact that
Augusta National will not talk to us at all."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson made that point clear in both his letter to Burk and his
official statement, which said:</TE>
<TE>   "We hope Dr. Burk and her colleagues recognize the sanctity of our
privacy and continue their good work in a more appropriate arena."</TE>

<HD>Just What Selig Didn't Need: Another Stalemate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Now, of course, they will expand the All-Star rosters, and there will
still be problems.</LD>
<LD>   Now, of course, they will go from 30 players on each team to maybe
33 or 34 or 35, and the respective managers will be faced with the
nightmare task of squeezing them all into a nine-inning game or
sending some home disappointed, even angry they weren't used and
wondering why they were asked to attend.</LD>
<LD>   That, however, will be far better than what happened at Miller
Park Tuesday night.</LD>
<TE>   The 73rd edition didn't end after nine innings.</TE>
<TE>   It went through 10 and then 11 innings, becoming an All-Star game
in the truest sense since all 60 players were used, the disappearing
rosters eventually translating into the latest and--momentarily, at
least--worst of Commissioner Bud Selig's ongoing nightmares.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than extending and risking injuries to the last two
pitchers on the American and National teams--Freddy Garcia of the
Seattle Mariners and Vicente Padilla of the Philadelphia Phillies--he
decided to call it after 11 innings, leaving it tied, 7-7, and a
crowd of 41,781 chanting "Let them play, let them play."</TE>
<TE>   Imagine.</TE>
<TE>   Bud Selig, who brought baseball back to Milwaukee, who got the
taxpayers to help him build this $400-million ballpark, was now being
booed from his front row box as he exited through the National League
dugout and fans threw debris on the field.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine.</TE>
<TE>   His crowning night turning into a crown of thorns.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine.</TE>
<TE>   An All-Star game that had supplied enough magic moments to
momentarily freeze the negative flow, an All-Star game played against
the distracting backdrop of a potential strike and possibly pervasive
steroid use, amid the fresh memory of Darryl Kile and Jack Buck and
the disgraceful fight between relatives of the late Ted Williams
(don't they know, as the Newsday headline said, "There's No Cryonics
In Baseball"), has now become just one more ugly incident.</TE>
<TE>   Selig would apologize to the fans, saying he understood their
unhappiness.</TE>
<TE>   He would commend Managers Bob Brenly and Joe Torre for doing what
the fans want them to do, which is use all of their players.</TE>
<TE>   He would say that the roster situation would be re-evaluated and
that the rosters would probably be enlarged.</TE>
<TE>   This, he said, should enable All-Star managers to avoid a repeat
of what had just happened and also reduce the criticism that annually
accompanies the selection process and the inevitable number of
snubbed players.</TE>
<TE>   It was actually possible to feel a little sorry for the
commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   He was in a no-win situation.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be highly improper to blame Bud or anyone else," said
Brenly, the Arizona manager.</TE>
<TE>   "The other managers and organizations entrust us with their
players. Can you imagine the reaction if we return them hurt or
unable to take their regular turns in the rotation?"</TE>
<TE>   Torre agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't have it both ways," the Yankee manager said. "You can't
ask us to use all of our players and then get upset when we don't
have anyone left. Bob and I both saved a starting pitcher for the end
in case he had to pitch more than an inning, but the last thing I
want to do is send Freddy Garcia back to [Seattle Manager] Lou
Piniella hurt and I'm sure that the last thing Bob wanted to do was
send Padilla back to [Philadelphia Manager] Larry Bowa hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel bad for Bud, but he had no choice."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Garcia nor Padilla had pitched in five days, meaning they
were on a regular schedule, but Piniella and Bowa would have been
justified in reacting angrily if either had been extended beyond the
two innings they each pitched.</TE>
<TE>   As it was, Torre, who usually doesn't pick pitchers who have
worked on the Sunday before the Tuesday game, did break that
unwritten rule for this game to pick the deserving Barry Zito, but he
allowed Zito to pitch to only one batter in the sixth inning and he
used Eddie Guardado, the Minnesota closer, to pitch to only two
batters in finishing that inning--those limited stints, perhaps,
coming back to haunt him in extra innings.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Brenly used both Mike Remlinger and Byung-Hyun Kim in
the four-run AL seventh as Kim took a page out of his disastrous
October resume.</TE>
<TE>   It was not a good night for the All-Star relievers on either team,
including Eric Gagne. The Dodger closer was whacked for a home run by
Alfonso Soriano.</TE>
<TE>   The toll eventually led to the unsatisfactory and unpopular
conclusion, wiping out a tasteful pre-game show that included
tributes to Williams, a parade of Hall of Fame players and just about
every former Milwaukee star except Bernie Brewer. It also wiped out a
Torii Hunter catch that is certain to be included in every All-Star
montage.</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota center fielder soared high above the fence in
right-center to take a home run away from Barry Bonds in the first
inning and leave Sammy Sosa undecided on whether to describe Hunter
as Michael "Air" Jordan or Superman. It was proved two innings later
that he is not Superman, and that Bonds can be deprived but not
denied. Not even Superman was going to catch his smoking drive off
the facade of the second deck in right.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter and Bonds would have been candidates for the most valuable
player award that is now named after Williams, but no award was given
because of the unique way the game ended.</TE>
<TE>   Let 'em play? They'll try it in the future with more than 30
players on a side. That might lead to arguments of another kind, but
we should at least have a winner and loser.</TE>

<DL>SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Here lies baseball's greatest hitter, finally thrown a curve he
couldn't reach.</LD>
<LD>   Here lies a summer hero, frozen solid.</LD>
<LD>   Here in this gray cinder-block building, on this scrub brush of a
street in an airport industrial park, a marble company on his right,
an adjustable bed factory on his left.</LD>
<TE>   Outside it is 110 degrees. Inside, suspended upside down in a
stainless steel tank filled with liquid nitrogen, a legend cools.</TE>
<TE>   Tough, brave, yet not strong enough to avoid being torn apart by
his family.</TE>
<TE>   Here lies Ted Williams.</TE>
<TE>   The Splendid Popsicle.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is All-Star day, so you have come to this desert neighborhood
to pay homage to baseball's ultimate All-Star.</TE>
<TE>   You remember a couple of years ago, when Ted Williams made his
final All-Star game appearance, on a golf cart at Fenway Park, in a
ceremony that moved modern-day players to tears?</TE>
<TE>   This was a hot-blooded human being who touched people. This was
not an ice sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   Yet here he is, at Alcor Life Extension Foundation, a cryonic
suspension facility that has parts of about 50 frozen corpses they
optimistically call "patients."</TE>
<TE>   Williams arrived here last weekend, shortly after his death at 83.</TE>
<TE>   His son, John Henry Williams, sent him, reportedly hoping to
squeeze even more money out of his name, or at least his DNA.</TE>
<TE>   His daughter Bobby-Jo Ferrell, is legally protesting, claiming her
father wanted to be cremated, his ashes spread over his beloved
Florida Keys.</TE>
<TE>   This messy, spooky affair is as ill-befitting Ted Williams as a
ninth-inning strikeout.</TE>
<TE>   Remember how he ended his baseball career with a home run?</TE>
<TE>   Remember how he refused to sit down on the final day of the 1941
season, even though it put his .400 batting average in jeopardy?</TE>
<TE>   This was a man who understood exits.</TE>
<TE>   Is hanging in frozen limbo in the middle of a desert warehouse
considered an exit?</TE>
<TE>   You approach the front door, marked Alcor Marketing and Resource
Center, sturdy and gray between two tinted windows.</TE>
<TE>   This could be a cellular-phone store or rug warehouse, until a
security guard leaps from his folding chair and blocks your way.</TE>
<TE>   An identification card is passed. The door opens a crack. Another
guard reaches outside and takes the card. There is much whispering.</TE>
<TE>   You called ahead, you say. You just need a minute for some quick
questions, you promise.</TE>
<TE>   The card is returned. The door slams shut.</TE>
<TE>   They are too busy. They will call you later.</TE>
<TE>   Which, of course, they won't.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing is bizarre," says Ron Johnson, owner of a sewing
workroom two doors down. "That door is locked all the time. You never
see anybody. It's odd. It's not normal. I feel so bad for Ted and
what the jerk kid is putting him through."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors who have toured the facility say that it is essentially
a warehouse filled with giant steel containers around what appears to
be a surgical unit.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's for the heads," says Brad Porter, president of the
air-conditioning company at the other end of the building.</TE>
<TE>   Porter's outfit, Air Conditioning By Jay Inc., knows all about the
heads.</TE>
<TE>   Employees there helped construct racks that hold the severed heads
of those who want to freeze only their brains.</TE>
<TE>   They also helped build some of those containers, which are
essentially tombs.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, it's kind of creepy, I know," says Porter.</TE>
<TE>   The air-conditioning company's phone number is 92-CHILL.</TE>
<TE>   "That should be Alcor's number," employee Sally Kling says.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors say it's just as creepy outside, where an ambulance
drives up at all hours to a back door that warns of hazardous
materials.</TE>
<TE>   Out front, a wide-eyed Alcor employee rides around the building on
a creaking bicycle.</TE>
<TE>   During calmer times, the windows are not tinted, and neighbors are
treated to a window display of one of the giant tombs.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time somebody new works here, they are taken past that
window to get their reaction," Kling says. "When they took me, I was
like, 'Oh my God.' "</TE>
<TE>   Ted Williams, one of our most honored athletes, has been consigned
to a sideshow.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in there with all the other stiffs, and I mean stiffs,"
Kling says.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Williams, the guy who used to tell the jokes, is in the middle
of a bad one.</TE>
<TE>   "We tell people, 'Why go over there and get frozen when you can
come here and get turned into beautiful stone?' " says Beverly
Durigon of Travertine International, the marble company next door.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Williams has gone from the baseball family to ...</TE>
<TE>   "The Addams Family," says another business neighbor, and on a
steamy All-Star afternoon, the whole room howls.</TE>

<HD>BriteSmile Accuses Rival of Patent Infringement</HD>
<DH>Courts: The firm files suit to challenge Discus Dental's
methods in tooth-whitening process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The highly competitive $1-billion tooth-whitening industry has
another skirmish on its hands, this time a patent infringement
lawsuit between two California companies looking to corner the market
on a state-of-the-art "chairside whitening" process using a
light-sensitive hydrogen peroxide gel.</LD>
<LD>   Walnut Creek, Calif.-based BriteSmile Inc., which filed suit
against Discus Dental Inc. of Culver City, is not challenging the
chemical formulation of Discus' in-office whitening process, but it
is accusing the company of violating two patents obtained this year
on the method of delivery. One patent is for whitening teeth by
isolating, preparing the bleaching and then exposing teeth to light
during the process; the other is for using a transparent and
light-sensitive whitening gel.</LD>
<LD>   "You can patent the method and that is the law of the land,"
Brite- Smile Chief Executive John Reed said. Reed said his company
was aware of Discus Dental's efforts to use the same method last
year, but said his company was restrained from taking legal action
until the patents were official.</LD>
<TE>   "Want your smile back? Come on in," says a typical BriteSmile ad.
"The process takes just over an hour. The reward lasts for years."</TE>
<TE>   It's the second lawsuit filed by BriteSmile against Discus Dental
this year. Earlier, the company accused Discus Dental of interfering
with contractual arrangements with dentists by pushing its ZOOM!
Product, which uses the advertising slogan "Ignite the White."</TE>
<TE>   Discus Dental Chief Operating Officer Ken Rosenblood slammed both
lawsuits as the desperate acts of a company that has seen its stock
price drop by more than two-thirds since March.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't violated any patents and you can't violate a contract
if the contract is illegal in the first place."</TE>
<TE>   Both companies are vying for the lucrative California market and
for a decisive share of the more than 1.2 million Americans who
annually use over-the-counter bleaching kits, custom-fitted bleaching
trays, whitening gels or undergo laser or light treatments in dental
offices.</TE>
<TE>   Reed and Rosenblood said that their companies are banking on a
sense among Americans that white teeth have become a social
imperative. Reed and other experts added that California,
particularly its southern half, is one of the hot zones for cosmetic
dentistry along with New York City and a few other parts of the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   Discus Dental is not a publicly traded company. It is projecting
revenue of $100 million this year.</TE>
<TE>   BriteSmile reported losses in each of the last four quarters on
revenue of $42 million. Its stock closed up 4 cents to $2 on Nasdaq,
down from its 2002 high of $6.26 on March 11.</TE>

<HD>Conexant Spins Off Imaging Unit</HD>
<DH>Hardware: The move is part of the chip firm's strategy of
separating unrelated businesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In its third divestiture this year, Conexant Systems Inc. said
Tuesday that it has spun off its digital imaging business as a
private company.</LD>
<LD>   The new company, Pictos Technologies Inc., makes semiconductors
and software for digital cameras. Though not profitable, the new
project has raised $17 million from venture capital firms Kleiner
Perkins Caulfield &amp; Byers, Alloy Ventures and others. Conexant, which
also contributed cash to the venture, retains majority ownership of
the new firm.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Strong, Pictos' chief executive, said the company will have
$25 million in revenue this year and become profitable by late 2003.</LD>
<TE>   The spinoff is part of Conexant's long-term strategy of breaking
off unrelated businesses that may be worth more separately than
combined within the company, said Nathaniel Cohn, an analyst with
Goldman Sachs in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "The strategy is to build more focused companies," Cohn said.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Conexant sold a 55% stake in its manufacturing plant to
Carlyle Group for $20 million and spun off the business as Jazz
Semiconductor. In June, it spun off its wireless chip business,
called Skyworks Solutions, after merging it with Alpha Industries.
Because of a broad downturn in the telecommunications industry, the
Newport Beach chip company has delayed plans for a public offering of
its Mindspeed Technologies business, which sells chips to
communications equipment makers.</TE>
<TE>   Strong, 41, said the imaging business did not fit in with
Conexant's core modem and networking business.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't a lot of strategic synergy" between the two
businesses, he said. "So Conexant felt that in order to maximize the
return for shareholders, it was better to privatize the company so it
has more focus, more agility."</TE>
<TE>   Conexant's stock closed unchanged at $1.50 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Honda, GM, Subaru SUVs Rated 'Good' in Crash Tests</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Small sport utility vehicles made by Honda Motor Co., General Motors
Corp. and Subaru earned "good" ratings in an insurer-funded group's
front-end crash test, and Ford Motor Co.'s Land Rover Freelander
sport utility rated "acceptable."</LD>
<LD>   The models that rated "good" were Honda's 2002 CR-V, GM's 2002
Saturn VUE and Subaru's 2003 Forester.</LD>
<LD>   The 40-mile-per-hour frontal offset test by the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety evaluates how well a vehicle protects
passengers when it is hit on the front-end driver's side. The test
looks at damage to the crash test dummy, intrusion into the driver's
compartment and how well the seat belt and air bag restrain the
dummy.</LD>
<TE>   The latest results show that auto makers are improving the
structure of small sport utilities, institute officials said. Only
two small sport utilities, Hyundai Motor Co.'s Santa Fe and an
earlier version of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.'s Subaru Forester, had
scored "good" on previous tests.</TE>
<TE>   "This will mean improved protection for people in serious
real-world crashes," Insurance Institute President Brian O'Neill
said.</TE>
<GT></GT>
<CP>PHOTO: The 2002 Honda CR-V earned a "good" rating after an
independent, 40-mile-per-hour frontal crash test. The dummy's
position after the test indicates that the driver's survival space

<HD>Filming on L.A. Streets Down From Year Ago</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The shooting of films, TV shows, commercials and music videos on the
streets of Los Angeles in June continued to drop from a year earlier,
when studios were rushing to finish projects as a possible actors
strike loomed.</LD>
<LD>   Days spent shooting in public areas during the month declined 19%
from a year earlier, according to the Entertainment Industry
Development Corp., which issues film permits for most of L.A. County.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest decreases continue to be in feature film shooting,
which was most affected by the strike fears. In June, film shooting
was down nearly 40% to 614 days.</LD>
<TE>   For the first half of the year, production days dropped nearly 20%
from a year earlier to 13,381. One production day equals a single day
of shooting on a project.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers are skewed from their usual levels because studios
accelerated film production in late 2000 and early 2001 so they would
be ready if writers and actors walked out. Both groups eventually
settled without a strike.</TE>
<TE>   Although the EIDC numbers don't include production on studio lots,
where permits aren't required, they are considered a barometer of
Southern California production activity.</TE>

<LD>Dissatisfied with President Bush's corporate reform plan, investment
overseers across the country are taking matters into their own hands
to force corporations and Wall Street investment firms to clean up
their acts.</LD>
<LD>   The treasurers of California and two other states say they won't
do business with investment banks that allow cozy relationships
between their corporate finance and investment research divisions.</LD>
<LD>   And prominent business leaders such as Intel Corp. founder Andy
Grove are joining an effort by Peter G. Peterson, chairman of
investment firm Blackstone Group, to press for corporate governance
reforms.</LD>
<TE>   These efforts represent the stern judgments of prominent people on
the corporate scene today.</TE>
<TE>   In almost all cases, these are lifelong business and professional
people who know the score--and don't accept Bush's conclusion that a
relative few corporate wrongdoers are causing all the trouble.</TE>
<TE>   They believe, as Peterson puts it in a letter to 120 pension and
investment funds, that the revelations about corporate malfeasance at
Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc., Global Crossing Ltd. and other firms are
"a moral cancer and a governance cancer, which must be cut out if our
economic health is to be restored."</TE>
<TE>   California Treasurer Phil Angelides, who administers the state's
$250 billion in public employee retirement funds, said Tuesday that
he will instruct the funds to bar investment banks from doing
business with the state unless they separate their corporate finance
activities from investment research to avoid conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   The treasurers of New York state and North Carolina agreed last
week to take similar actions under a compact with California.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to take consumer action because the president's speech
was weak on legislation and weak on investment banking reform,"
Angelides said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Those three state treasurers are Democrats, and politics may play
a part in their reception of Bush's speech. But prominent Republican
business figures also are pressing for reform.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our equity culture is in danger," said Robert A.G. Monks,
a longtime advocate for corporate reform and director of the federal
government's pension fund protection agency under President Reagan.
"The people are angry and confused and needed a leader, but the
president didn't lead," Monks said.</TE>
<TE>   Groups founded by Monks, including International Shareholder
Services and Lens Inc., buy stock in companies to use their status as
shareholders to press for corporate reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson, who served as secretary of Commerce under President
Nixon, is organizing a Commission on Public Trust and Private
Enterprise to unite major institutional investment funds to press for
corporate governance reform.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Grove, Peterson has recruited former Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker, former Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt, Peter Gilbert, chief investment
officer of Pennsylvania's state retirement system, and others to his
commission. He stresses that his group takes no financial support
from the business community.</TE>
<TE>   The group aims to devise "best practice guidelines" for corporate
management and to have the pension funds ask companies in which they
own stock to adopt the guidelines or be disciplined by shareholder
votes against management or the sale of stock holdings.</TE>
<TE>   That Bush traveled to Wall Street on Tuesday to condemn corporate
wrongdoing is encouraging to all of these private and public efforts.
The speech raises the visibility of the problem and gives a green
light to private reform efforts.</TE>
<TE>   However, even admirers of the speech questioned its effectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the idea of recapturing funds gained by accounting
deception," said Barbara Lougee, professor of accounting at UC
Irvine, "but I don't know how it can be implemented. Corporate
executives have lawyers."</TE>
<TE>   What measures are reformers most interested in and why? Most focus
on accounting reform because deceptive accounting has been at the
heart of the repeated corporate scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Many, such as Lynn Turner, a former SEC chief accountant who now
teaches at Colorado State University, support legislation by Sen.
Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) that would empower a governmental oversight
board to set auditing standards. The legislation also would prohibit
an accounting firm from performing the basic audit and also doing tax
consulting for the same client on grounds of potential conflict of
interest.</TE>
<TE>   But the accounting industry has been lobbying against that
legislation, Turner says, and pushing a bill that passed the House of
Representatives under the leadership of Rep. Michael G. Oxley
(R-Ohio). Oxley's bill, which Bush complimented in his speech
Tuesday, would place auditing standards under the supervision of an
SEC panel that would be guided by accounting companies.</TE>
<TE>   Bush did not refer to other reforms that investment overseers
want, including an accounting treatment for stock options that would
recognize them as an expense.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush is caught between corporate America and a groundswell of
anger and concern among the public," said a prominent investment
expert who criticized the president only on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The criticism is that the president chose to side with what
critics charge is a class of corporate managers unwilling to
surrender prerogatives and perquisites.</TE>
<TE>   But reform by private actions is coming to corporate America
nonetheless, because public confidence is eroding and anger is
rising. Serious money has been lost by funds vested with the
retirement savings of thousands of Americans. The California Public
Employees' Retirement System, for example, has lost $580 million in
WorldCom. Serious money will lead to serious reforms.</TE>

<HD>Gateway Plans Anti-Piracy Classes</HD>
<DH>Computers: The free sessions will discuss legal ways to
download music and copy CDs. Critics question their motives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER and JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rip, mix, learn?</LD>
<LD>   Computer retailer Gateway Inc. plans to provide free classes to
consumers on the do's and don'ts of online music, showing how to
download music and burn CDs without violating copyrights.</LD>
<LD>   The three-hour classes--to be held at all 274 Gateway Country
retail stores--may help deflect criticism from record-label
executives. The executives argue that companies such as Gateway
encourage consumers to pirate music and movies online to boost sales
of their computers, CD recorders and related gear.</LD>
<TE>   Some music and movie industry leaders back a bill in the Senate to
mandate anti-piracy technology in computers and other digital
devices, a proposal Gateway opposes. Other groups want lawmakers to
slap a special tax on the sale of computers, Internet connections and
blank CDs to compensate copyright holders for piracy.</TE>
<TE>   Computer firms including Apple Computer Inc. have infuriated the
entertainment industry over the last several years, as hardware
makers tout the power of their equipment to swap music and movies.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway spokesman Brad Williams said the way to fight piracy is by
offering consumers a compelling legitimate alternative. Although the
music industry has "some very legitimate grievances" about piracy, he
said, "we haven't seen much from the major labels in terms of
educating consumers."</TE>
<TE>   The classes "sound cool, but I'd like to see the training guide,"
said Hilary Rosen, chairwoman of the Washington-based Recording
Industry Assn. of America, which represents the nation's five largest
music corporations. "Call me cynical but optimistic."</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Aram Sinnreich of Jupiter Research, a technology
consulting firm, called the classes "a brilliant little piece of PR"
that gives Gateway political cover "simultaneously as they're
promoting the music-stealing ability of their machines."</TE>
<TE>   Tension between Gateway and the music industry increased in April
when the San Diego-based computer company launched a radio,
television, online and in-store advertising campaign to rally support
for consumers' right to download music from the Internet. The RIAA
derided the advertising campaign, saying Gateway was using
"misleading scare tactics" to frighten consumers into buying more of
the company's products.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said the free courses will encourage consumers to
download music only when it's authorized by the copyright holders,
such as at the artists' Web sites or from a subscription service such
as EMusic. As for burning CDs, Williams said, Gateway believes that
it's legal only when consumers are recording copies for personal use
of CDs they already own.</TE>

<HD>Health-Care Group Hires Hollywood Agent</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The health-care industry, tired of playing the bad guy in movies such
as "John Q" and TV shows such as "ER" and "Chicago Hope," has hired
an agent to help get better roles.</LD>
<LD>   The American Assn. of Health Plans, which represents more than
1,000 health maintenance organizations, has signed with the William
Morris Agency.</LD>
<LD>   The AAHP said it wants to offer producers expertise on such issues
as medical privacy and bioterrorism, but does not want or expect veto
power over stories.</LD>
<TE>   "What we're trying to do is get a level playing field. We're not
saying it's verboten to attack some part of the health-care system.
We're saying there is another side to what we do," Mark Merritt,
senior vice president of the AAHP, said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Movies and TV shows in recent years have portrayed dedicated
doctors fighting heartless hospital administrators and bean-counting
insurance companies.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, "John Q," starring Denzel Washington, told the
story of a father who cannot afford a heart transplant for his son
and holds an emergency room hostage.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of attacking the film, the AAHP bought ads deflecting the
focus of anger from insurance plans to "a runaway litigation system
and expensive government regulations."</TE>
<TE>   Financial terms of the hiring of the agency were not disclosed.</TE>

<HD>Honda to Expand in N. America by 15%</HD>
<DH>Autos: The firm will spend nearly half a billion dollars to
boost vehicle production.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES and JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Showing strong faith in both an improving U.S. economy and a new-car
market that can sustain annual sales of 16 million to 17 million
units, American Honda Motor Co. Inc. said Tuesday that it would spend
nearly half a billion dollars over the next 30 months to boost annual
North American production by 180,000 vehicles, a 15% jump.</LD>
<LD>   The move is the latest in a string of new factories or plant
expansions announced by import car makers for their North American
operations in recent months--an expansion occurring at the same time
domestic car makers are shuttering some of their plants and
ratcheting down production capacity.</LD>
<LD>   Honda and other import brands see the North American market,
particularly the U.S., as fertile ground for more growth at the
expense of domestic brands, whose market share has been shrinking for
years.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a warning sign to the Big Three," said Michael Flynn,
director of the University of Michigan's automotive think tank. "The
Big Three are clearly not putting investment and product development
into passenger cars, except for a few niche vehicles."</TE>
<TE>   American Honda, which is based in Torrance, said it would spend
$425 million to double capacity in Alabama to 300,000 vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   It will spend $46 million more to increase engine production at an
Ohio plant and boost its vehicle production in Canada by 30,000 a
year.</TE>
<TE>   The move comes two weeks after Nissan Motor Co. said it would
expand capacity at its $1-billion Mississippi plant, still under
construction, and three months after South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co.
said it would build a $1-billion assembly factory in Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota Motor Co. also is building an engine plant in Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   The rush by Asian manufacturers to build in this country is a
clear signal that import brands are gunning for more of the Big
Three's home market.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the push by Asian and European brands comes in the
light-truck market--pickups, sport utility vehicles and
minivans--that once was the sole domain of domestic brands.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty clear there's a real big problem for the domestics,"
said Rod Lache, auto industry analyst for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Including Honda's new growth plan, Lache says, there will be 1.5
million units of additional capacity for light trucks, primarily
SUVs, in the U.S. by 2005, for total capacity of 10.5 million light
trucks a year. "There's no way the market is going to absorb that,"
and the domestic auto makers are going to be hit hardest, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and
DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler Group have no new market segments in which
to expand, the Japanese, South Korean and German auto makers still
can grow with mid-size sport utilities and big trucks, said Greg
Salchow of the Detroit office of investment bank Raymond James &amp;
Associates.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. auto market has surprised analysts and auto executives
with its continued strength in the recent weak economy.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. passenger vehicle sales set a record of 17.4 million in 2000,
and last year was second-best, with 17.1 million sales.</TE>
<TE>   Most experts say they expect new vehicle sales this year to be in
the 16.5-million-to-16.8-million range, which would keep it among the
best years.</TE>
<TE>   "We have seen a fundamental change in volume of the market over
the past 20 years. It was 13 million annually [in the 1980s], then up
to 14 to 15 million in the '90s; now it seems to be in
16-to-17-million range," said Thomas Elliott, American Honda's
executive vice president.</TE>
<TE>   "We see the market gradually expanding as the driving-age
population grows and the number of vehicles offered is growing and
the number of multiple-car households is growing, while car prices
remain relatively affordable," Elliott said. "We think this will
continue over the next five to 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   Honda's expansion will add 2,000 jobs at the Alabama plant to
bring total employment there to 4,300 by late 2004. The company now
has about 26,000 employees in North America.</TE>
<TE>   Honda executives would not say which vehicle they will build in
the expanded sections of the Alabama plant, which currently builds
the Odyssey minivan.</TE>
<TE>   The van shares much of its architecture with the Honda Pilot and
Acura MDX SUVs, which are built in Canada and could be added to the
Alabama factory.</TE>
<TE>   The new assembly line will be a "flex" line that can easily switch
from one type of vehicle to another. "Consider that we are doing the
Element [light truck] on the same line as the Civic [in Ohio], and
that gives you an idea of the range of flexibility," said Charles
Ernst, manager of Alabama plant.</TE>
<TE>   The imports' U.S. market share this year has been increasing,
especially for the South Korean car makers.</TE>
<TE>   Sales for Toyota and its Lexus luxury brand rose 2.2% through
June; Nissan and Infiniti sales were up 7.7%; Mitsubishi was up
12.6%; South Korea's Hyundai rose 16.2% and its Kia subsidiary's U.S.
sales soared by 20%. Honda's and Acura's combined sales were down
marginally, by 0.9%, due to a slowdown of Honda's best-selling model
as it prepares to release a completely redesigned Accord this year.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, GM sales dropped 1.6% through June, Chrysler Group's
American brands fell 3.9%, and the U.S. brands of Ford Motor, which
lost $5.45 billion last year, declined 12.2%.</TE>

<HD>Suit Against J&amp;J Alleges Misuse of Patents</HD>
<DH>Drugs: The filing follows a ruling that the firm's
protections for Imodium Advanced are invalid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Johnson &amp; Johnson's McNeil-PPC Inc. unit is accused in a lawsuit of
misusing patents to block competition to a version of its Imodium
anti-diarrhea medicine that also helps control gas.</LD>
<LD>   Patents protecting Imodium Advanced were invalidated by a federal
judge in Philadelphia on June 25, opening the door to competition
from Perrigo Co., a maker of store brand over-the-counter drugs.
Imodium Advanced, also sold over the counter, is an improvement on
McNeil's Imodium A-D, which has generic rivals.</LD>
<LD>   Perrigo would have begun selling a generic version of Imodium
Advanced as early as October 2000 if McNeil had not filed a
patent-infringement suit, consumer Marna Berkman of New York claims
in a lawsuit. She seeks class-action status on behalf of other
consumers.</LD>
<TE>   McNeil engaged in anti-competitive conduct to "obtain and maintain
monopoly power in the market for Imodium Advanced," the suit says.
McNeil spokesman Mark Gutsche said the antitrust suit is "baseless."
"We obtained the patents in good faith and took no actions that
interfered with Perrigo's right to market their product," Gutsche
said.</TE>
<TE>   McNeil plans to appeal the judge's ruling on the patents.</TE>
<TE>   "We strongly disagree with the decision by the U.S. District Court
concerning the validity of the patents," Gutsche said. "We also
reject the statements from the court regarding our motives for
obtaining patents on Imodium Advanced."</TE>
<TE>   According to the antitrust suit, the judge in the patent case said
McNeil's actions before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office were
"careless, irresponsible and, at the very least, tantamount to
studied and deceptive ignorance."</TE>
<TE>   Buoyed by about $45 million in advertising and marketing since its
introduction in 1997, Imodium Advanced sales are expected to reach
$200 million by the end of the year, the suit contends.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, filed July 1 in Philadelphia, seeks damages and a
court order barring McNeil from improperly blocking generic
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Perrigo shares fell 47 cents to $11.42 on Nasdaq. Johnson &amp;
Johnson fell 96 cents to $52.62 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Bad Loans Could Blunt Asia's Growth</HD>
<DH>Economy: A report says delays and years of weak measures
have cost the region an opportunity to tackle its massive debt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Japan's largest retailer, Daiei, announced a half-hearted plan in
2000 to improve profitability, refocus its business lines and work
down its $16.8-billion debt.</LD>
<LD>   Two years later, Daiei's financial condition is worse, its
mountain of debt remains high and its brand name has further
deteriorated.</LD>
<LD>   As Daiei goes, so goes much of Asia. According to a report being
released today, delay and years of weak measures have cost the region
a golden opportunity to tackle its enormous bad-debt problem.</LD>
<TE>   Compared with 2000, the region now finds itself 33% deeper in the
hole, weighed down by an estimated $2 trillion in nonperforming loans
expected to blunt economic growth for years.</TE>
<TE>   "Things could have been a lot better by now," said Jack Rodman,
author of "Nonperforming Loan Report: Asia 2002" by Ernst &amp; Young.</TE>
<TE>   Painful economic problems generally are easier to address when
times are relatively good, and that was the situation Asia found
itself in two years ago. Most economies in the region were enjoying
strong growth, the 1997-98 Asian currency crisis had awakened many
governments and their citizens to the risk of inaction, and
international investors were willing to buy bad debt at a discount.</TE>
<TE>   Now economies such as Japan, China, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand,
Indonesia, India, Malaysia and the Philippines find their
restructuring jobs more difficult. The global economy has slowed, the
accounting scandals in the U.S. have made international investors
more cautious, and deflation has intensified with many Asian
governments still reluctant to take bold steps, given the short-term
political and economic costs.</TE>
<TE>   That said, there also are some encouraging changes. In the last
several months, governments in Taiwan, the Philippines, India, China
and Japan have passed new legislation, initiated sales of
nonperforming loans and stepped up bank inspections.</TE>
<TE>   "NPLs are no longer such a dirty little secret to be swept under
the rug," Rodman said. "Have they fully recognized the scope of the
problem? No. But it's an improvement."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, a growing number of economists say, Asia's debt
problem is as much a political problem as an economic one. In many
countries, senior bureaucrats and politicians have shied away from
alienating fellow politicians, tycoons or mainstay companies by
foreclosing on loans or taking other tough steps generally seen as
necessary to regain traction.</TE>
<TE>   Equally daunting for many leaders is the prospect of being
penalized at the polls as voters register their wrath at thousands
more layoffs or at publicly funded bailouts of well-heeled bankers.</TE>
<TE>   The giant among Asia's nonperforming loan economies is Japan, with
a problem Ernst &amp; Young estimates at $1.2 trillion, or about 60% of
Asia's total bad-debt load.</TE>
<TE>   Japan has had more time to mull over, deflect and downplay its
problems than most other nations, given that most of its bad loans
were triggered by the collapse of its speculative investment bubble
more than a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1997, Japan has disposed of about $300 billion in bad loans,
but the bad-debt tide keeps rising, with the absolute amount the same
as it was two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders have become more willing to admit they have a serious
problem. "It's important to correct Japan's bank overcapacity problem
and quickly process the financial institution's nonperforming loans,"
Masajuro Shiokawa, Japan's finance minister, told delegates at an
Asia-Europe forum in Copenhagen over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Shiokawa's comments aside, many analysts question Japan's
definition of "moving quickly" as its leaders continue to muddle
along.</TE>
<TE>   The runner up in Asia goes to China, which Ernst &amp; Young estimates
has a $480-billion bad-debt problem. China is juggling a different
equation, stemming largely from the wrenching task of trying to
transform a centrally planned economy into one more based on market
mechanisms.</TE>
<TE>   The government has taken a tougher line than some of its neighbors
in admitting the problem and moving to sell off bad loans.</TE>
<TE>   "NPLs are a big headache for China. One difference at the margin,
however, is that the leadership is probably more proactive than the
Japanese," said Fred Hu, Hong Kong-based executive director with
Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Third in line is South Korea with a little more than $100 million
in bad debts, according to the report. Most economists give South
Korea good marks for addressing head on its bad-debt problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Without cleaning up, we can't expect a future," says Choi
Byung-kil, head of strategy with Hanvit Bank, the new bank created
from the merger of Hanil and Korea Commercial banks. "If we don't
accelerate our efforts, then we'll have to face another crisis again
soon, so the pressure remains very intense."</TE>
<TE>   South Korea has emerged as something of a model for its neighbors
as it has juggled the political and economic shoals of joblessness,
wrenching social change and accusations that the nation's leaders are
selling the nation's assets to outsiders for way too little.</TE>
<TE>   "Every country has a fear they're selling out the country cheap to
foreigners," said Kim Cheon-hong, executive director of Korea Asset
Management Corp., a government agency charged with disposing of bad
debt. "They think they're never going to get big gains. But it's like
chumming. At first there are no big fish, but they show up."</TE>
<TE>   Ernst &amp; Young's bad-debt figures--as well as those of many other
private-sector analysts--are far larger than the official statistics
provided by most governments. Japan, for instance, pegs its
nonperforming loan total for the nation's 133 banks at $344.2 billion
as of March. Although that's a 25% jump over the previous year, it is
still less than a third of the Ernst &amp; Young estimate.</TE>
<TE>   The difference is partly due to the amount of political pressure
banks and governments are under to understate the problem, keep
problems off the books and minimize their provisions for bad loans.</TE>
<TE>   "Their hope is that Asia's struggling economies and borrowers will
recover and make them whole again," the report says.</TE>
<TE>   But the disparity in numbers also underscores another problem: the
need for international standards covering the definition,
classification and treatment of bad loans at a time when the WorldCom
and Enron scandals reveal the need for more careful and consistent
handling of accounting problems.</TE>

<HD>Factory Growth in O.C. at a Standstill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Growth in Orange County's manufacturing sector came to a standstill
in the second quarter, in contrast to figures showing factory
activity continuing to pick up steam nationwide, according to a
survey of Orange County purchasing managers released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Chapman University's quarterly index of purchasing managers
declined to 49.9 in the second quarter, after surging to 57.7 in the
first three months of the year. A value over 50 means manufacturing
activity is growing, while a number under 50 indicates contraction.</LD>
<LD>   Chapman University economist Esmael Adibi blamed the decline in
the index on continued weakness in the county's high-tech sector as
well as a slowdown in inventory restocking that occurred in the first
quarter.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a little disappointing after a solid first quarter," said
Adibi, director of the Anderson Center for Economic Research at
Chapman University. "We are seeing a pause after all that inventory
rebuilding."</TE>
<TE>   The second-quarter performance of the Orange County purchasing
manager's index stands in contrast to recent figures from the Tempe,
Ariz.-based Institute of Supply Management, which compiles a
much-watched monthly index measuring the strength of manufacturing
activity nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   That index rose to 56.2 in June from 55.7 in May, reflecting the
fifth straight month of factory expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Adibi said the worst appears to be over for Orange County's
manufacturing sector, which has shed more than 12,000 factory jobs
from its pre-recession peak.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said the local index appears to be lagging behind the
national figures partly because the Orange County factory sector is
more heavily weighted with high-tech firms, which still are suffering
the effects of the tech meltdown and declines in commercial aircraft
production.</TE>
<TE>   The Chapman University survey's high-tech index slid to 43 in the
second quarter from 54.6 in the first three months of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County purchasing managers surveyed by Chapman University
reported declining prices and a big drop in new orders. Adibi said
that bodes ill for profits as well as employment, as manufacturers
probably won't add to their payrolls until they are convinced that
the fledgling recovery is for real.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wait-and-see situation," Adibi said. "Everyone is waiting
until those new orders come in."</TE>

<HD>Studios Sue Film88.com Over Copyrights</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The major Hollywood film studios filed a copyright infringement
lawsuit Tuesday against online movie distributor Film88.com and the
Malaysian attorney who allegedly launched the renegade service.</LD>
<LD>   The suit targets Alex Tan, also known as Soo L. Tan, and three
entities he allegedly directed: MasterSurf Inc., a company in Agoura
Hills; Film88.com, a Web site based in Iran; and Broadband Universal
Corp., a company that allegedly operates Film88.com.</LD>
<LD>   The suit seeks more than $30 million in damages related to the
unauthorized copying of at least 232 films, including such diverse
works as "Sunset Boulevard" and "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone."</LD>
<TE>   Film88.com enabled consumers to watch hundreds of hit movies and
classic TV programs online in near-VHS quality, charging $1 for
unlimited viewings over a three-day period.</TE>
<TE>   But the site didn't obtain the studios' permission to offer the
movies, nor did it pay for them, although it claims to have offered
30% of its revenue as compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Although some of the Film88.com Web pages were based in Iran, its
servers (the computers that stored and played movies through the Net)
were in Holland.</TE>
<TE>   A few days after the site launched, its Internet service provider
in Holland disconnected the servers at the request of the Motion
Picture Assn. Later, a Dutch judge granted the MPA's request to seize
Film88.com's servers.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit says Film88.com was Tan's second attempt to profit
from the studios' films. Previously, the lawsuit alleges, Tan
operated "a virtually identical piratical system" called Movie88.com
in Taiwan, which authorities in that country shut down in February.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to imposing financial penalties and confiscating all
of Film88.com's profit, the lawsuit seeks a permanent injunction
barring Tan and the associated companies from violating the studios'
copyrights.</TE>
<TE>   "Defendants' past conduct makes it clear they will resurrect their
infringing service by, for example, changing the Internet address of
their Web site and relocating some or all of their operations to
computers located in yet another country," the lawsuit says.</TE>
<TE>   Tan, MasterSurf and Broadband Universal could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit may not be the only legal problems faced by Tan. Mark
Litvack, the MPA's director of legal affairs and worldwide
anti-piracy efforts, said the association continues to discuss its
options with the governments of Taiwan and Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that Mr. Tan thinks this is a game and he's playing
with other people's chips, it's our intention to teach him that he's
not," Litvack said.</TE>

<HD>Regulators to Shut Down NextCard Accounts Today</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fallout from the February failure of online credit card issuer
NextCard Inc. will land on about 800,000 customers today when federal
regulators close their accounts, abruptly cutting them off from some
incentive programs that reward their past spending.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which has has been overseeing
the business since regulators seized the accounts Feb. 7, waited
until Tuesday to tell NextCard customers their Visa credit cards
would become worthless today. Regulators closed NextCard's banking
subsidiary because of heavy loan losses.</LD>
<LD>   Many NextCard customers received the news of the account closures
in e-mails sent Tuesday. Other customers won't find out until they
receive letters later this week.</LD>
<TE>   "We tried to give as much warning as possible," said FDIC
spokesman David Barr. "It's been a real juggling act for us to keep
these accounts active."</TE>
<TE>   NextCard's account holders will not be able to cash in bonus
points they stockpiled through the incentive programs once available
to them. Online retailer Amazon.com, which owns an 8.1% stake in San
Francisco-based NextCard, provided one of the credit card company's
most popular incentive programs. The FDIC advised NextCard account
holders that Amazon wouldn't redeem the spending points, but Amazon
said it would honor them.</TE>
<TE>   NextCard's stock, which peaked at $53.12 in late 1999, was
delisted from Nasdaq in March.</TE>
<TE>   NextCard said in May that it probably would file for Chapter 11
bankruptcy. Company officials did not return calls Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Antibody Creation on Corn Patented</HD>
<DH>Biotech: Technique makes disease-fighting proteins from
crops and may make millions for Epicyte Pharmaceutical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A small California biotech company said Tuesday that it has exclusive
rights to a new patent on a technique for producing therapeutic
antibodies from corn and other farm crops. Epicyte Pharmaceutical
Inc. of San Diego claimed that the patent gives it a leadership
position in an emerging industry, potentially worth millions, with
competitors including such agricultural giants as Monsanto Co.</LD>
<LD>   The patent was granted to Scripps Research Institute, where the
technology was developed by Epicyte's founders in 1989. Epicyte said
the patent applies to all plants and all antibodies, whether human or
animal.</LD>
<LD>   Antibodies are proteins naturally made by white blood cells that
defend the body against disease. They can target specific invaders
without disturbing other cells.</LD>
<TE>   Drug makers produce antibodies for cancer and other diseases using
conventional genetic engineering techniques. Of the 11 antibody-based
drugs on the market, none are made in plants.</TE>
<TE>   Most therapeutic antibodies are manufactured in hamster ovary
cells, an intricate process that requires sterile factories with
fermentation tanks and sophisticated purification equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Ninety antibody-based drugs are in various stages of development
at biotechnology companies. That has ignited a search for
cost-effective ways to produce large quantities of antibodies, valued
because they can target disease while causing few side effects.</TE>
<TE>   Some companies are experimenting with ways to genetically engineer
cows so that they produce human proteins in their milk, or to
engineer hens so that their eggs contain human antibodies.</TE>
<TE>   Epicyte is among the handful of companies trying to turn
agricultural crops into antibody factories, an alternative dubbed
"biopharming." The company estimates that a single acre of
genetically engineered corn can produce the same quantity of drugs as
a typical multimillion-dollar factory.</TE>
<TE>   The patent issued to Scripps on Tuesday covers DNA sequences
called "zip codes." They are molecular instructions that direct the
antibody production process in plants. The patent is the fourth
issued to Scripps on the 13-year-old invention by Epicyte founders
Andrew Hiatt and Mich Hein.</TE>
<TE>   Previous patents did not cover all DNA sequences, said Debra
Robertson, director of intellectual property for Epicyte. That
omission enabled competitors to engineer around the patents by
writing their own zip codes, she said.</TE>
<TE>   With the issuance of the patent Tuesday, "we believe now everyone
will have to come to us" for a license, Robertson said. The patent
expires in 2009.</TE>
<TE>   Monsanto said it was studying the patent and had no comment on it.
"We have a large patent base that covers many aspects of the
production of proteins in plants," spokesman Gary Barton said.</TE>
<TE>   Epicyte handled the patent application for Scripps, which licensed
the technology to Epicyte many years ago, said Thomas Northrup,
patent counsel for Scripps. Northrup and Robertson declined to
comment on the financial deal between Epicyte and Scripps. Epicyte is
privately held.</TE>
<TE>   Epicyte, in partnership with Dow Chemical Co., is developing an
antibody to treat the herpes simplex virus. Other corporate partners
include Johnson &amp; Johnson's biotechnology unit, Centocor.</TE>
<TE>   However, analysts said it is too soon to assess the commercial
promise of biopharming.</TE>
<TE>   And some worry that transgenic crops could end up in the food
chain. Wind might carry pollen from genetically altered plants to
neighboring fields, or animals might ingest the crops. The Food and
Drug Administration is expected to issue regulations on transgenic
crops soon.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, antibodies produced in plants contain sugars not
found on human antibodies, raising the possibility of rejection by
the body's immune system. Robertson said Epicyte's antibodies haven't
triggered an immune response in animals. "We don't think the
difference [in antibodies produced in plants and humans] is
important," she said.</TE>
<TE>   An answer may emerge soon. Centocor expects to know in three to
six months whether plant-made antibodies function as well as
conventionally produced antibodies, said Richard McCloskey, Centocor
vice president of medical research. He sits on Epicyte's scientific
advisory board. (Centocor also has a research deal with Monsanto.)</TE>
<TE>   The new technologies, including those using farm animals, could
trim antibody production costs by 25%, which would benefit patients,
McCloskey said. "If you produce a product, what good does it do if
the patients can't afford it and the health-care system won't pay for
it? As a clinician, that is my primary motivation" for looking at new
technologies, he said.</TE>

<LD>Fidelity Federal Bank, a Glendale savings and loan, will pay $1.6
million to settle a Justice Department lawsuit alleging it violated
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act by discriminating against sub-prime
credit card customers who were Latino or on welfare, the government
said.</LD>
<LD>   Third parties marketed the credit cards during the 1990s to
high-risk borrowers in New York, Mississippi and Alabama, Fidelity
President Greg Mitchell said. He said FBOP Corp., an Oak Park, Ill.,
banking company that in December purchased Fidelity's parent, Bank
Plus Corp., for $141 million, settled the 5-year-old case without
admitting wrongdoing.</LD>

<LD>Two consumer advocacy groups urged antitrust enforcers to challenge
merger plans involving the three leading cruise lines.</LD>
<LD>   P&amp;O Princess Cruises' proposal to combine with Royal Caribbean
Cruises Ltd., and Royal Caribbean's hostile bid to acquire Princess
would reduce competition and particularly harm retirees on fixed
incomes, the groups said.</LD>
<LD>   The American Antitrust Institute raised its opposition in a letter
to Federal Trade Commission Chairman Timothy Muris. The National
Consumers League joined in the plea.</LD>
<TE>   On the NYSE, P&amp;O Princess American depositary receipts rose 9
cents to $24.90, Royal Caribbean fell 33 cents to $19.85, and
Carnival fell 27 cents to $27.88.</TE>

<LD>Hotel chains have made progress in providing business opportunities
to minorities, but have been slow to increase black property
ownership and advertise in black-owned media, an NAACP report found.</LD>
<LD>   The report assigned grades to 11 national chains--Marriott
International Inc. received the highest grade, B, on the 2002 report
card; Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide Inc. was the lowest with a
C.</LD>
<LD>   In the last report card, issued two years ago, the NAACP gave
grades of mostly Cs and Ds to the chains.</LD>

<LD>   Robertson said the firings will occur over the next few months and
include all departments at the San Francisco-based firm.</LD>
<LD>   Boston-based FleetBoston, which purchased Robertson Stephens for
$800 million in 1998 as investments in technology companies soared,
said last week that it expects a loss of more than $282 million on
the sale of the investment bank. Robertson Stephens has lost $80
million in the last five quarters.</LD>

<LD>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. must pay $10.2 million to relatives of a man who
died when a Firestone tire bought from the retailer failed and a
sport utility vehicle flipped, a Texas state court jury decided.</LD>
<LD>   The jury last week awarded $29 million in damages to the family of
Terry Tripp, who was riding in a Chevrolet Blazer that rolled over in
September 2000 after a Firestone Dueler APT-model tire failed. Jurors
held Sears 35% responsible for the wreck and Bridgestone Corp.'s
Firestone unit 65% responsible. Firestone already had settled with
the family.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based Sears fell $1.17 to $51.40

<LD>The Senate has cut off lawmakers and their staffs from the most
popular online file-sharing networks--not so much to protect
copyrights, but to safeguard the upper house's computer network.</LD>
<LD>   In a notice sent out this month, the Senate's Sergeant at Arms
said "many computer security exposures have been reported" by users
of such popular "peer-to-peer" networks as Kazaa, Morpheus and
Gnutella.</LD>
<LD>   These include security holes that could be exploited by attackers,
the potential for unwittingly sharing sensitive Senate files and the
exchange of viruses.</LD>
<TE>   After noting that the networks also were used to "distribute
copyrighted intellectual property illegally," the memo says, "our
security evaluation concluded that continued use of peer-to-peer
client software and networks is an unacceptable operational risk to
the Senate and can impact the ability of the Senate community to
carry out its core missions." For that reason, the Sergeant at Arms
said, connections to peer-to-peer networks were being blocked.</TE>
<TE>   "We had nothing to do with this memo, but we certainly appreciate
the Sergeant of Arms' understandable concern about the security risks
of illegitimate peer-to-peer networks," said Hilary Rosen, chairwoman
of the Recording Industry Assn. of America.</TE>

<HD>Minorities Get Link to Funding</HD>
<DH>Entrepreneurs: U.S. agency launches equity access program
that offers opportunity for venture capital deals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to increase private equity funding to minority-controlled
firms, the U.S. Minority Business Development Agency and a
Washington-based nonprofit have launched a program to help minority
entrepreneurs tap into the venture capital network.</LD>
<LD>   The agency's equity capital access program will provide training
and counseling to more than two dozen minority entrepreneurs,
selected from among 200 applicants nationwide. Five finalists will
then be introduced to venture capitalists, although it will be up to
the entrepreneurs to secure actual funding.</LD>
<LD>   The program, which had its Los Angeles kickoff Tuesday, marks a
strategy shift for the agency, which in the past had focused largely
on helping minority business owners increase access to loans and
government contracts.</LD>
<TE>   Recognizing that access to capital--a perpetual problem for small
and minority-owned businesses--increases with access to the venture
capitalists, the program will serve as a sort of venture matchmaker,
hooking up carefully screened business owners with key players in the
VC community.</TE>
<TE>   "The venture capital industry is a relationship-driven business,"
said Ronald N. Langston, director of the Minority Business
Development Agency. "Investors are more likely to invest in companies
owned by people they know, or to look at companies for investment
based upon the recommendations of people they trust.</TE>
<TE>   "Minority businesses have not had access to these networks," he
added. "This program addresses these impediments."</TE>
<TE>   Experts in both the minority business community and the venture
capital network agree that ethnic minorities do not receive VC
funding at the same rate as whites.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Monica-based Milken Institute said in a report two years
ago that venture capital funds that target minorities received only
about 2% of all venture capital dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "Most minorities get their funding from minority-run funds," said
Betsy Zeidman of the Milken Institute.</TE>
<TE>   But that estimate does not take into account the large numbers of
Asian-owned firms, especially in the Silicon Valley, that have reaped
venture capital dollars from sources other than minority-focused
funds, said Mark Heesen, president of the National Venture Capital
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Based on his knowledge of the industry, Heesen believes that about
25% of VC dollars go to minority entrepreneurs.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to boost venture capital to minority entrepreneurs across
the nation, the Minority Business Development Agency launched the
equity access program with a budget of as much as $200,000 and an
Aug. 2 application deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the quality of their business plans and other factors, 25
entrepreneurs this September will head to a "boot camp" in Washington
for training in, among other things, accessing venture capitalists,
structuring a deal and understanding the "due diligence" process.</TE>
<TE>   Five will present their concepts to venture capital experts for
feedback, and possibly funding.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to find five fundable companies," said James Moore,
managing director of the Emerging Venture Network, the
Washington-based nonprofit that will help run the program.</TE>
<TE>   The program is seeking companies in industries with high growth
potential, including biotechnology and software development. The
companies should be looking for at least $1 million in funding, and
have the potential to return 10 times the investment in three-to-six
years, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The aim of the program is to move minority entrepreneurs--whose
numbers are growing at four times the overall U.S. business growth
rate--beyond the traditional funding sources of debt and "family,
friends and fools," Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   Moore acknowledged that after the dot-com bust, the venture
capital purse strings have not been as loose. Total venture capital
funding dropped to $33.63 billion last year, from $92.44 billion in
2000, according to a survey by Venture One and Ernst &amp; Young.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Moore and Heesen said venture capitalists continue to
search for good deals, especially those already vetted.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the VCs have to turn over every rock to find the best
opportunities," Moore said. "They can no longer just look at deals in
their own neighborhood. They have to look farther and harder than
ever before.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a tremendous opportunity here," he said.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Faces Probe by French Regulators</HD>
<DH>Finances: Investigators focus on when the media giant knew
of cash flow problems and how soon it revealed them. The firm secures
a $989-million loan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal achieved a crucial first step toward averting a
financial collapse by securing a key deal with its lenders, but the
French entertainment giant now faces an investigation into how it has
disclosed its complex finances.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation, which centers on whether the company disclosed
its liquidity crisis in a timely fashion, will complicate efforts by
new Chief Executive Jean-Rene Fourtou to restore investor confidence
in Vivendi, whose stock value has fallen 70% this year. Its shares
closed down 26 cents to $17.60 on Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts expressed worries about the timing of the investigation,
as investors already are on edge over a wave of accounting scandals
involving WorldCom Inc., Adelphia Communications Corp. and Enron
Corp.</LD>
<TE>   "This is not a good thing," said Paul Kim, a senior media analyst
with Kaufman Bros. "It adds another level of uncertainty that should
throw caution to investors."</TE>
<TE>   France's stock market regulator, the Commission des Operations de
Bourse, announced Tuesday that it launched an investigation into
financial information released by Vivendi since January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators from the agency visited Vivendi's Paris headquarters
to review the firm's books.</TE>
<TE>   The cause and scope of the investigation are unclear, but among
the key questions investigators will examine are when the company
became aware it faced a liquidity problem and how soon it conveyed
that to investors, said a source familiar with the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The commission, which does not have authority to fine companies,
refers cases of wrongdoing to public prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Gerard Rameix, the commission's chief executive, described the
probe as routine. "This doesn't mean we suspect wrongdoing. We would
do this any time the market is this confused."</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi spokeswoman Anita Larsen said the company was cooperating
fully with the inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   On the same day Vivendi's board replaced CEO Jean-Marie Messier
last week, it disclosed for the first time what Messier had denied:
Vivendi faced a short-term cash crunch. It must repay $1.8 billion to
lenders by the end of this month, using up most of the $2.4 billion
in cash and credit lines it has remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns over its $30-billion debt and more than $1 billion in
unexpected liabilities led credit-rating firms Moody's Investors
Service and Standard &amp; Poor's to downgrade Vivendi's debt last week.
S&amp;P estimated that Vivendi faced about $6 billion in financial
obligations this year, nearly double what most analysts expected.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's said Monday that it might further reduce the company's
rating to below "junk."</TE>
<TE>   The investigation was announced the day after Vivendi negotiated a
deal for a $989-million loan from six banks, said a source familiar
with the loan.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi, which owns Universal Studios, also is close to securing a
$2-billion loan from its banks, giving Vivendi's new management team
enough cash to meet its obligations over the next three months as it
evaluates its strategy and decides what units it needs to sell.</TE>
<TE>   The lenders include BNP Paribas and Societe Generale, banks that
helped oust Messier by threatening to withhold credit unless he was
removed.</TE>
<TE>   "It just gives them a few more months of breathing room," said
George Nichols, an analyst with Morningstar Inc.</TE>

<HD>Wyeth Woes Weigh Down Drug Shares</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: The sector slides on news of possible
risks in a hormone medication. Also, Merck further delays Medco IPO.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of major drug companies suffered another steep decline Tuesday
as a popular drug of industry giant Wyeth was linked to health risks.</LD>
<LD>   Another pharmaceutical giant, Merck, said late in the day that it
again would delay a planned $980-million initial public offering of
its Medco Health pharmacy unit.</LD>
<LD>   Drug stocks closed broadly lower after a government study showed
that Wyeth's Prempro, one of a group of hormone replacements used by
more than 8 million menopausal women, was linked to increased risk of
breast cancer and heart disease.</LD>
<TE>   The report sent shares of Wyeth down $11.94, or 24%, to $37.30 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "It's bad," said Lloyd Kurtz, a health-care analyst at Harris
Bretall Sullivan &amp; Smith, which held 1.2 million Wyeth shares as of
March. Hormone replacement products are "a very important cash-flow
generator" for Wyeth.</TE>
<TE>   The risk to Wyeth further unnerved drug stock investors. The
sector has fallen sharply this year on concerns about earnings growth
and, most recently, on jitters over Merck's accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Merck has come under fire for the way its Medco unit has booked
billions of dollars in revenue. The concerns have been magnified by
the doubts about corporate accounting raised by a host of financial
scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Merck has said its accounting for Medco followed generally
accepted accounting principles.</TE>
<TE>   But after trading ended Tuesday, Merck said it would delay the IPO
of Medco a third time, signaling that the firm had failed to lure
buyers even after reducing the stock's asking price, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Merck said the postponement was "due solely to market conditions,"
and that it expects to complete the deal within 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   Merck fell $2.06 to $45.75 in regular NYSE trading. Among other
drug stocks, Eli Lilly lost $2.11 to $49.98, Pfizer slid $1.31 to
$33.10 and Abbott Laboratories lost $1.59 to $35.41. All trade on the
NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   The American Stock Exchange index of 15 major drug stocks has
tumbled 25.5% this year, compared with a 17% drop in the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index.</TE>
<TE>   Other health-care stocks also were hit. Among drug distributors,
AmerisourceBergen plunged $8.02, or 11.3%, to $62.78, and Cardinal
Health sank $5.66, or nearly 10%, to $52.68, both on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   One drug firm offered some good news: Corona-based Watson
Pharmaceuticals said it would meet second-quarter and 2002 earnings
estimates. The generic-drug maker said it would earn 38 cents to 41
cents a share in the second quarter, compared with 52 cents a year
earlier. The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson First
Call is 39 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   For the year, Watson said it expected to earn $1.60 to $1.70 a
share.</TE>
<TE>   Watson shares rose 70 cents to $19.60 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Fall Sharply on Earnings Fears</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: President's call for stiffer penalties to stem
corporate fraud doesn't stop the sell-off.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors sent stocks sharply lower for a second straight session
Tuesday as worries about second-quarter earnings reports overshadowed
President Bush's proposal to increase the penalties for corporate
fraud.</LD>
<LD>   The losses, which followed a sell-off Monday, erased most of what
was left of Friday's 324-point rebound rally. Drug and soft drink
stocks were among the biggest losers, with only gold-mining shares
showing real strength. The dollar fell, as did bond yields.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said that after months of accounting scandals and
disappointing financial results, it will take more than a few words
from the president to convince investors that it is safe to come back
to the market.</LD>
<TE>   "We're just coming into earnings season now," said Will Braman,
chief investment officer of John Hancock Funds. "It's time for 'show
us the money,' and investors' expectations are not very high. There
is a lot of skepticism. The numbers we get are going to be pawed over
and looked at very critically."</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 178.81 points, or
1.9%, at 9,096.09. Microsoft, up 29 cents to $53.21, was the only
gainer among the 30 Dow stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Broader stock gauges also retreated. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index fell 24.15 points, or 2.5%, to 952.83. And the Nasdaq composite
index lost 24.49 points, or 1.7%, to 1,381.12, bringing its loss so
far this week to 4.6%.</TE>
<TE>   Losers led winners by 4 to 3 on Nasdaq and by 3 to 2 on the New
York Stock Exchange in moderate trading.</TE>
<TE>   In a widely anticipated speech on Wall Street Tuesday morning,
Bush called for longer prison sentences for executives who defraud
the public and stronger powers for the Securities and Exchange
Commission. He also wants to put together a task force to pursue and
prosecute corporate fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Although some analysts doubted whether Bush's comments were strong
enough to restore investor confidence shaken by repeated accounting
scandals, some investment pros said the market's sell-off should not
be construed as disappointment in the president's corporate
governance proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "There will always be skeptics who say it isn't enough," said Art
Bonnel, manager of the Bonnel Growth fund.</TE>
<TE>   Other strategists said the market's troubles probably will
continue until a more optimistic corporate earnings picture emerges.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing that could really turn this market around is the
earnings reports," said Phil Dow, director of equity strategy at
brokerage RBC Dain Rauscher. "People want to see positive comments
from the chief financial officers about the revenue picture. That's
what has been missing."</TE>
<TE>   General Electric's earnings, expected Friday, will be watched
closely, he said, and second-quarter reporting season begins in
earnest next week with about 600 companies expected to announce
results.</TE>
<TE>   Among Tuesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Drug maker Wyeth plummeted $11.94, or 24.3%, to $37.30 on news a
government study had raised questions about Wyeth's hormone
supplements. The selling spread to other drug companies, including
Merck, which lost $2.06 to $45.75. Merck fell Monday on concerns
about its accounting methods.</TE>
<TE>   * Chip stocks pulled back after Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank
reduced their forecasts for many companies in the group, citing weak
order prospects. Applied Materials dropped $1.28 to $17.72, while
Texas Instruments lost 85 cents to $23.30 and Intel slid 54 cents to
$17.96.</TE>
<TE>   * Retail stocks were more mixed. Pacific Sunwear rose $2.01 to
$24.48 after it increased its second-quarter earnings forecast. But
Tiffany fell $3.09 to $30.49 after warning its second-quarter profit
will fall to the low end of its previously expected range.</TE>
<TE>   * Two software companies were among the day's losers. Shares of
Retek, Nasdaq's leading percentage loser, plunged 63%, or $10.85, to
$6.46. Citrix Systems fell 92 cents, or 16%, to $5. The two gave
bleak financial forecasts and pressured other companies in the
software sector.</TE>
<TE>   * The S&amp;P index of gold stocks rose 5.8% as gold climbed $4 to
$316.10 an ounce. Among the gainers: Newmont Mining, up $1.71 to
$28.62, and Goldcorp, up 88 cents to $10.78.</TE>
<TE>   * The battered telecom sector showed some life. Lucent
Technologies rose 23 cents to $2.04, while Qwest Communications rose
50 cents, or about 24%, to $2.60.</TE>
<TE>   * Bond yields dipped as the decline in stock prices heightened
speculation that the Federal Reserve won't raise interest rates until
next year. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to
4.73% from 4.80% Monday.</TE>

<HD>Pepsi Bottler's Outlook Drags Down Sector</HD>
<DH>Beverages: The firm says results for third and fourth
quarters may miss forecasts. Shares of PepsiCo, Coca-Cola ease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pepsi Bottling Group Inc. took the pop out of soft drink stocks
Tuesday with a modestly disappointing earnings outlook.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 1 bottler and distributor of Pepsi soft drinks said its
second-quarter profit rose 14% despite some cool weather, but the
firm said third- and fourth-quarter results could be below
expectations.</LD>
<LD>   The company's shares dived $4.64, or 14%, to $27.75 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   The report also dragged down PepsiCo Inc., which fell $3.58, or
7.3%, to $45.27, also on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Soft drink stocks had been among the market's best performers in
winter and spring, as many investors hunted for relative "safe-haven"
shares as technology stocks continued to dive.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Pepsi Bottling said its cold-drink sales volume during
the second quarter was essentially flat because of cooler than normal
temperatures in parts of North America.</TE>
<TE>   Competitive pricing in select international markets also put a
damper on results, Chairman Craig Weatherup said.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the Somers, N.Y.-based company said it earned $139
million, or 47 cents a share, in the quarter ended June 15, compared
with $122 million, or 41 cents, a year earlier. Net revenue rose 7.3%
to $2.21 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The average estimate of analysts polled by earnings tracker
Thomson First Call was 47 cents.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it still expects 2002 worldwide volume sales to
increase 3% and prices to rise 3%, driving cash flow higher. But net
profit for the year will be $1.41 to $1.45 a share, the firm said.
The average estimate of analysts was $1.46, Thomson First Call said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the market has significantly overreacted," said J.P.
Morgan analyst John Faucher.</TE>
<TE>   But at brokerage UBS Warburg, analyst Caroline Levy cut her
ratings on Pepsi Bottling and PepsiCo to "buy" from "strong buy."</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a sense that this company, which has basically exceeded
expectations each quarter since it went public [in 1999], is becoming
more of an in-line performer," Levy said.</TE>
<TE>   Among soft drink rivals, bottling giant Coca-Cola Enterprises fell
$1, to $20.75, and Coca-Cola Co. eased 84 cents, to $56.44, on the
NYSE.</TE>

<HD>SEC May Propose Rule to Limit Consulting Work by Auditors</HD>
<DH>Reform: White House says the proposal would give corporate
audit panels responsibility for clearing such work by their
accountants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission is drafting a rule that would
ban accounting firms from doing any consulting work for their
corporate clients unless specifically approved by the client's audit
committee, the Bush administration said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed rule would mark a shift for SEC Chairman Harvey L.
Pitt, who is facing public outrage over corporate scandals, including
accounting irregularities at Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc. As
described in a statement by the White House, the plan would put the
onus on corporate audit committees to permit any consulting by their
accountants.</LD>
<LD>   Pitt, a Republican, urged Congress in March to delay passing any
bill that would prohibit auditors from also working as consultants
for their clients. Three weeks ago, Pitt said in a letter to
President Bush that the SEC will seek public comment on prohibiting
"certain" consulting services by auditors.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a muddle as to what the SEC is going to do," said Paul R.
Brown, chairman of the accounting department at New York University's
Stern School of Business. "The president's agenda is vague, and we
may hear something different tomorrow. I suspect the White House and
SEC haven't coordinated this yet."</TE>
<TE>   In his speech Tuesday on Wall Street reforms, Bush "called on the
SEC to adopt new rules to ensure that auditors will be independent
and not compromised by conflicts of interest."</TE>
<TE>   An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment on the White House
statement. Pitt, in a written statement on the president's speech,
said, "We are committed to forceful, aggressive, creative and prudent
efforts to revitalize and improve our system."</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Pitt have been under pressure from Democrats in Congress
to toughen oversight of corporate accounting. The Senate is
considering a bill sponsored by Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) that
goes beyond a Republican measure passed by the House in setting new
restrictions on how and when accounting firms can sell consulting
services to their clients.</TE>
<TE>   Sarbanes and other Democrats have said accounting firms have an
incentive to soften their corporate audits of companies if the firms
also are trying to win or keep consulting contracts with those same
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional concerns about consulting rose after Enron's
auditor, Arthur Andersen, disclosed that Enron paid Andersen $27
million for consulting and $25 million for auditing in 2000. Enron,
which filed for bankruptcy protection in December, hid $1 billion in
losses in off-the-books partnerships, according to an investigation
commissioned by the board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Andersen was convicted of criminal obstruction of
justice in connection with the firm's shredding of Enron audit
documents.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom in Talks to Get $3 Billion in Funding</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The firm says it will decide within three weeks
whether it will seek bankruptcy protection. It had originally sought
$5 billion from lenders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc. said Tuesday that it expects to decide within three
weeks whether to pursue bankruptcy protection or some other financial
reorganization.</LD>
<LD>   "We have no written formal proposals, but we expect to get term
sheets from at least two different sources shortly," said John W.
Sidgmore, chief executive of the U.S. long-distance telephone and
data services company embroiled in a $3.9-billion accounting scandal.
"I would say within three weeks we'll know."</LD>
<LD>   The company said it is in talks to secure $3 billion in funding,
rather than the $5 billion it originally sought. That money would
give WorldCom a financial cushion to meet its interest payments and
operating expenses and stave off a bankruptcy filing.</LD>
<TE>   A bankruptcy filing by WorldCom, which has $30 billion in
"junk"-rated debt, would eclipse the Chapter 11 filing by collapsed
energy trader Enron Corp. as the nation's largest insolvency.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom said it could get some interim financing before it
pursues any larger financial reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   Its banks include J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., Citigroup Inc. and Bank
of America Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Sidgmore said WorldCom had been contacted by some bondholders
about a potential debt-for-equity swap, but no formal discussions
have started.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom, which carries half of the world's Internet traffic, is
pressing ahead with its efforts to unload its unprofitable wireless
telephone business and other non-core assets, such as its Latin
American investments.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in discussion on all those, but I can't comment more
without revealing my hand," Sidgmore said.</TE>
<TE>   Kathleen Abernathy, a commissioner with the Federal Communications
Commission, said if WorldCom were forced to pull the plug on its
operations, the FCC could delay shuttering of crucial businesses,
such as the UUNet Internet business and long-distance telephone
network, until customers found new providers.</TE>
<TE>   Sidgmore and WorldCom Chairman Bert Roberts faced Congress on
Monday on the accounting debacle, just a day before President Bush
called for stiffer penalties for corporate abuses and a tougher
federal securities watchdog.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's former CEO Bernard J. Ebbers and its former chief
financial officer, Scott D. Sullivan, who were at the helm when the
company mishandled its accounts, refused to testify in the nine-hour
hearing, invoking their rights against self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   In Monday's hearing before the House Financial Services Committee,
Sidgmore said he was not aware of any wrongdoing or crime committed
by Ebbers.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know of anything to accuse him at this moment," Sidgmore
said.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom has no plans to renegotiate Ebbers' severance package,
which pays him $1.5 million a year for life, or bonuses he received
during his tenure.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom is trying to recruit new board members and may shuffle
the members of its audit committee, Sidgmore said. It expects to get
at least two new members to replace Sullivan and Ebbers. Sullivan,
who was fired June 24, remains a member of the board, but WorldCom
has asked him to resign.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Clinton,
Miss.-based WorldCom with fraud, alleging that it improperly booked
routine expenses as long-term capital investments for five quarters
starting in 2001, hiding losses of $1.22 billion.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom said it would comb its financial statements as far back
as 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a few other issues being investigated," said Sidgmore,
who declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, WorldCom fired its auditor, Arthur Andersen,
and replaced the firm, which also worked for Enron, with KPMG.</TE>
<TE>   Sidgmore declined to comment on whether WorldCom would sue
Andersen for failing to detect the accounting problems, or to recover
fees paid to the auditing firm.</TE>
<TE>   Because WorldCom asked KPMG to scour its books for 1999 and 2000,
KPMG must review whether it has any client conflicts that would
prevent it from working for the No. 2 U.S. long-distance telephone
company.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom shares fell 2 cents to 21 cents on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Companies Will Replace Seven Foreign Firms in S&amp;P 500</HD>
<DH>Indexes: The unusually large shift will add UPS and Goldman
Sachs, among others, after close of trading July 19.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standard &amp; Poor's said Tuesday that it would make an unusually big
change to the S&amp;P 500 index of blue-chip stocks, replacing the
index's seven remaining foreign companies with seven U.S.-based
firms.</LD>
<LD>   After the close of trading July 19, these companies will be
removed from the index: Royal Dutch Petroleum, Unilever, Nortel
Networks, Alcan Inc., Barrick Gold Corp., Placer Dome Inc. and Inco
Ltd.</LD>
<LD>   Added will be United Parcel Service Inc., Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., Prudential Financial Inc., EBay Inc., Principal Financial Group
Inc., Electronic Arts Inc. and SunGard Data Systems Inc.</LD>
<TE>   The make-over was prompted by S&amp;P rules aimed at eliminating index
overlap and tailoring products for asset-allocation purists. It will
make the S&amp;P 500 "a better reflection of the large-cap segment of the
U.S. equities market," said David Blitzer, head of the committee that
chooses S&amp;P index members. S&amp;P is a division of New York-based
McGraw-Hill Cos.</TE>
<TE>   The two European companies and five Canadian companies were
"double-counted" in the S&amp;P Global 1,200 index, and their elimination
from the S&amp;P 500 resolves that issue, S&amp;P said.</TE>
<TE>   The change puts all S&amp;P 500 members in compliance with current
selection criteria, which require members to be U.S. companies, S&amp;P
said. The seven companies entered the index--some as far back as 65
years ago--before the guideline was in place and before S&amp;P
established a series of global indexes. Tyco International Ltd.,
based in Bermuda, is considered a U.S. company by S&amp;P, said spokesman
Michael Privitera.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Pope, a strategist at Barclays Global Investors in San
Francisco, said the shift would mean about 2% turnover for the S&amp;P
500, the biggest change this year.</TE>
<TE>   Pope said the move "helps make the index cleaner." Nortel, for
example, was a concern of some clients, because the telecom company
was a big component of the Canadian stock market but also was
included in the S&amp;P 500.</TE>
<TE>   Max Isaacman, author of "How to Be an Index Investor"
(McGraw-Hill, 2001), said that although several of the new companies
are in the tech and financial sectors, the long-term effect on S&amp;P
500 performance may be minimal.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, the S&amp;P 500 is going to react as the U.S. economy
reacts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P said the effect on the stock prices of companies added to or
deleted from the index tends to be short-term. On average, deleted
stocks lose 11.7% between announcement and effective dates, S&amp;P said,
but those losses are made up by the sixth trading day after the
change.</TE>
<TE>   Pope said it would be "interesting to watch" whether such swings
are magnified this time by "the sheer impact of so many changes at
once."</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>St. Paul Cos., the fourth-biggest U.S. business insurer, postponed
for a fourth time an initial public offering of its reinsurance arm,
Platinum Underwriters Holdings, citing "market conditions."</LD>
<LD>   "We're temporarily postponing it," a spokesman for St. Paul said.
"We're still going to get it done."</LD>
<LD>   The St. Paul, Minn.-based insurer had postponed the offering until
this week at the earliest. Its stock fell $1.77 to $34.65 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   The delay underscores the difficulties companies face in raising
money through stock sales as U.S. stock markets are in a prolonged
slump. Drug maker Merck &amp; Co. on Tuesday indefinitely postponed the
$1-billion IPO of its Medco Health Solutions Inc. unit.</TE>
<TE>   This year, companies have raised less than $36 billion globally in
the IPO market, half the amount sold last year in the same period.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IBM Corp., which is selling its hard-disk drive business to Japan's
Hitachi Ltd. for $2.05 billion, said the unit had a pretax loss of
$423 million last year.</LD>
<LD>   The world's largest computer maker disclosed financial details on
its hard-disk drive business for the first time in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. It had published data only on its
larger Technology Group, which includes hard-disk drives and
semiconductors.</LD>
<LD>   Without the hard-disk drive unit, IBM would have earned $4.59 a
share in 2001, 24 cents more than the $4.35 it reported, the filing
said.</LD>
<TE>   The computer maker has been exiting money-losing businesses and
hiring contractors to do more manufacturing to reduce costs as it
copes with a sales slump.</TE>
<TE>   IBM will treat the sale as a discontinued operation under
generally accepted accounting principles. The computer maker issued
data on the hard-disk drive business for 2001 and the first quarter
of 2002 to help investors evaluate its profit from continuing
operations.</TE>
<TE>   IBM shares fell $1.63 to $69.67 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares in Deutsche Telekom rose on growing speculation that Chief
Executive Ron Sommer will be replaced after leading an expansion that
has saddled the telecom giant with a huge debt load. The stock closed
up 6.8% on the Frankfurt exchange, which was down overall, and rose
73 cents to $11.10 on the NYSE. The shares held their gains even
after the government, Telekom's biggest shareholder with a 43%
holding, denied a report it offered the job to a veteran auto
executive.</LD>
<LD>   Business magazine Wirtschaftswoche said Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder approached former Volkswagen Chief Executive Ferdinand
Piech about the post Friday. Sommer would step down by Monday at the
latest, the report said, citing unidentified sources.</LD>
<LD>   A government spokesman said that Piech attended an event sponsored
by VW at Schroeder's office Friday, but that Telekom was not
discussed. Volkswagen also denied that Piech, still a member of the
company's board, had been offered the job. A Telekom spokesman
declined to comment.</LD>
