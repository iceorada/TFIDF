<HD>Clarke Less Than What He Appears</HD>
<DH>Television* The actor loses 100 pounds, but his character
on 'The Job' hasn't--yet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANICE RHOSHALLE LITTLEJOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Meet Lenny Clarke. Stand-up comic. Sitcom actor. Diet guru.</LD>
<LD>   No, this is not a joke. While Clarke spends much of his time on
"The Job" playing languid detective Frank Harrigan--who's constantly
stuffing himself with doughnuts, Chinese food, birthday cake or
whatever else he can inhale--these days he just plays a funny fat guy
on television.</LD>
<LD>   Off-screen, the actor has dropped nearly 100 pounds since
November, from tipping the scales at 326 to recently weighing in at
230. And he's dropping weight daily, with a strict diet and exercise
regimen, aiming to slim down to a svelte 200 pounds. It's all he can
talk about these days, and he's finding plenty of willing listeners.</LD>
<TE>   "He was talking about it on 'The View' today," Denis Leary said
during an afternoon phone conversation from New York a few weeks ago,
after he and Clarke wrapped up their chat with Barbara Walters and
company for what was supposed to be an appearance to promote the new
season of the salty cop comedy (created by Leary and writer Peter
Tolan), which returned to the ABC lineup in January.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really funny, because when we got up there, he sat down on
the couch and just kind of took over and started talking about his
diet, and all these women in the audience couldn't wait to hear about
this guy's diet," Leary said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm seriously thinking about writing a book," Clarke said
enthusiastically on the phone from New York. "You know Richard
Simmons dances around in his little hot pants, and he's still kind of
chubby-looking to me. This is a guy who made billions of dollars
trying to get people to lose weight. But I don't know a lot of guys
who want to dress up in hot pants and jump around to oldies music."</TE>
<TE>   For the remaining eight episodes this season, Clarke will look
like his old self. But Leary is already making plans to let Clarke
flaunt his new physique next season--assuming there is a next
season--if only for a short time.</TE>
<TE>   Said Leary, "We're writing an episode where Frank's been on
vacation for a few weeks, and he comes back having lost all this
weight, and we're all like, 'Oh, my God!' And he says, 'Yes, I feel
like a new man.' So all of us, individually, decide to quit our main
vices. ... Then he goes away for a couple more weeks of vacation and
comes back with all the weight gained back, and we're like, 'Oh,
great!'"</TE>
<TE>   The issue of a third season for "The Job" remains up in the air.
Consistently bested in its 9:30 p.m. Wednesday time slot by NBC's
White House stalwart "The West Wing," "The Job" has yet to find a
sizable audience.</TE>
<TE>   Talking about the wretched ratings game, Clarke said, gives him a
weird sense of a deja vu to his own self-titled CBS series "Lenny."
CBS' answer to ABC's hit blue-collar queen "Roseanne," the 1990
sitcom starred Clarke as a working-class stiff from Boston, juggling
two jobs, a wife, kids, his parents, a no-good brother and an
onslaught of money problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Lenny" premiered to generally good reviews and plenty of hype
from CBS but a tepid audience response--perhaps abetted by constant
time shifting and preemptions for coverage of the Gulf War. By March
1991, the comedy was yanked off the air.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt 'Lenny' was a great show. I felt it was a quality show.
That's why I hope that ABC gives us time to develop an audience [for
'The Job']," Clarke said.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood was--and still is, to a certain degree--a bit daunting
for the Boston native, the oldest son of eight children from a
working-class, Irish-Catholic family. But then again, he never
actually thought he'd be in show business in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   While studying political science at the University of
Massachusetts, Clarke worked as a janitor in Cambridge City Hall. One
night he went to the Ding Ho Chinese Restaurant in Boston to watch
some comedians perform and decided to give stand-up a try.</TE>
<TE>   He returned the following week, telling the owners he had lots of
experience working the Las Vegas club circuit. They gave him his
first shot onstage. But because he hadn't developed any of his own
material, he stole a routine he'd heard days earlier from a Woody
Allen album.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone told me I was great, and then this little man came
backstage and said, 'Mr. Clarke, you're very, very funny, but you
don't need to be doing other people's material.' From that day on,
I've never done anyone else's material. But I bombed for a long
time," Clarke said.</TE>
<TE>   It took 15 years of stand-up to lead Clarke to the Montreal Comedy
Festival in Toronto, launching his television career. Still, with two
failed shows under his belt (the other a short-lived Fox variety
series, "The Sunday Comics," of which he was host), Clarke found his
personal life spiraling out of control.</TE>
<TE>   "When I started 'The John Larroquette Show' [in 1993], if you can
believe this, I was 176 pounds," he said. "I'd gone through a
divorce. I had lost 'Lenny.' I had lost 'The Sunday Comics.' I had
lost my nice house in Marina del Rey. I'd lost everything. I was so
depressed. Then I get 'The Larroquette Show,' and I was really into
craft services. I just went nuts. I gained 200 pounds doing that
show."</TE>
<TE>   Clarke now eats one meal a day, works out three times daily and
can be seen swimming, surfing or jogging near his Martha's Vineyard
home, which he bought five years ago with his second wife, Jennifer,
a charter fishing boat captain.</TE>
<TE>   As for his career, things are good, Clarke said. Last week, he was
in New York taping his first stand-up special for "Comedy Central
Presents ... ," which begins its new season this spring. He also has
a cameo role in the film "Baby's in Black," with Dustin Hoffman. "I
play a loud, drunk guy in a bar. Not a big stretch. But I've got to
tell you, it was a really enjoyable experience," Clarke said.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, he's waiting for word on "The Job"--and whether
he'll have one this fall. "I just hope and pray that we make it,"
Clarke said, "because I've never had more fun doing anything in my
life, except for sex.... Even when it's bad, it's great."*</TE>
<TE>   "The Job" is shown Wednesday nights at 9:30 on ABC. The network
has rated this week's episode TV-14-L (may be unsuitable for children
under 14, with a special advisory for coarse language).</TE>

<HD>Local Newscasts Feel Financial Pinch</HD>
<DH>TV* Declining ad revenue and a weak economy force some
independent and small-market stations to rethink priorities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY BERGEN</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Local news shows, the once-vaunted cash cows of television stations,
are no longer sacred.</LD>
<LD>   With ad revenues shrinking and expenses ever climbing, TV station
owners are wrestling with costs; in some cases, they are getting out
of the local news business altogether.</LD>
<LD>   Although previous economic downturns have led to some culling of
local news operations, many experts say the current trend may not
necessarily ease as the economy rebounds.</LD>
<TE>   The combination of an explosion of news and entertainment options
and changing lifestyles has led to a steady erosion of local news
audience share, especially for the late news. Chicago's big three
network-owned stations, for instance, have seen the combined ratings
for their late newscasts fall by more than a third in less than 10
years.</TE>
<TE>   Although Chicago's stations are clearly feeling the pressure from
falling revenue, the prospect that one of them will eliminate its
news operation seems remote. But such decisions have been made in
smaller markets, with Sinclair Broadcast Group killing local
newscasts within the last four months at its ABC affiliates in
Winston-Salem, N.C., the nation's 44th largest market, and in St.
Louis, the 22nd largest.</TE>
<TE>   Without a doubt, the weak economy and anemic ad market play major
roles in the demise of these newscasts.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically, No. 3 and No. 4 stations will bail out of news in
tight times," noted Tom Wolzien, senior media analyst with Sanford C.
Bernstein &amp; Co., an investment research and management company.</TE>
<TE>   "And we're likely in the next year to see more, as smaller
stations and weaker stations have more and more problems," he said.
"A lot of small broadcasters are outside their debt covenants now
because ad revenues have been so bad."</TE>
<TE>   Smaller stations are feeling squeezed by government mandates to
digitize operations and by decreasing compensation from networks to
run their programming, noted George DeVault, president and general
manager of Holston Valley Broadcasting Corp., which decided to stop
producing local newscasts this month at its ABC-affiliated and
UPN-affiliated stations in Kingsport, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Holston is negotiating to buy local newscasts from another
affiliate in the region.</TE>
<TE>   But other factors--including a proliferation of news and
entertainment choices, changes in lifestyle and the expected further
consolidation of TV station ownership--could lead to additional
thinning of the ranks even when the economy turns around, some
observers say.</TE>
<TE>   "The past decade has brought too many new local newscasts, too
many new competitors such as cable and Internet and too much audience
fragmentation," Hank Price, a senior fellow at Northwestern
University's Media Management Center and former general manager at
WBBM-TV, wrote in a recent paper.</TE>
<TE>   "For many stations, [local news] will never again be the 'cash
cow' of the 1990s," wrote Price, now general manager at WXII-TV in
Winston-Salem, owned by Hearst-Argyle Television. "In the end, most
communities will end up with one or two 'mega' news stations while
other outlets will offer entertainment or specialized programming."</TE>
<TE>   His prediction may sound dire, but local newscasts, which generate
40% to 50% of stations' annual revenues, clearly are no longer the
moneymaking machines they were as recently as 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "A review of traditional programming and advertising business
models is going on everywhere, at every level; market size doesn't
matter," said Larry Wert, president and general manager of WMAQ-TV in
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Weaker players in markets around the country are exploring a range
of steps, including greater use of syndicated programming,
rebroadcasting shows in different time slots and greater use of paid
programming, he said. Inside news operations, some stations have
expanded use of freelance on-air talent, angering unionized reporters
and anchors.</TE>
<TE>   "Some are finding it more economical to purchase newscasts
prepared by another station than to go to the expense of studios and
all the infrastructure you need," said Barbara Cochran, president of
the Radio-Television News Directors Assn.</TE>
<TE>   And some media companies are experimenting with merging the news
operations of their newspapers and TV stations, Price noted.</TE>
<TE>   Still, several observers think it is premature to predict that
local newscasts will dwindle to one or two major outlets per market,
as Price suggests.</TE>
<TE>   "I can remember in the late '70s and early '80s, when people were
saying all three networks cannot survive, and there was speculation
on which would go out of business or which one would drop news," said
Bob Papper, a professor of telecommunications at Ball State
University and co-author of an annual study on TV newsroom
profitability. "And you know what? It hasn't happened."</TE>

<LD>"Collateral Damage" led the weekend with $15.1 million, but Arnold
Schwarzenegger still is seeking to recapture the box-office punch of
"Terminator 2" and "True Lies," which made him a star.</LD>
<LD>   Warner Bros. took a risk when it delayed release of the
terrorism-themed action film last year, after the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "Considering the topical nature of the subject matter, I think
Warner Bros. made the right decision," said Paul Dergarabedian,
president of box office tracking firm Exhibitor Relations Co. "Had
the film not gone to No. 1, it would have been a major
disappointment."</LD>
<TE>   Coming in second was "Big Fat Liar," which grossed $11.6 million;
"Rollerball" battled poor reviews and other negative press to debut
in third place with $9 million.</TE>

<LD>Somehow, some way, the Da Camera Society of Mount St. Mary's
College's Chamber Music in Historic Sites found yet another
splendidly unlikely space for a concert Sunday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   This time, it was a breathtaking, predominantly Spanish-style,
1923-vintage Pasadena estate that had just reverted to its original
name, the William Henry Peters house, after a recent sale.</LD>
<LD>   Though not much more than a stone's throw from the 134 Freeway,
the estate, with a marvelous duck pond dominating the garden, was a
tranquil co-star to soprano Ellen Hargis and lutenist Paul O'Dette in
a program of 17th century music geared toward Valentine's Day.</LD>
<TE>   Obviously matters of love don't change much over the centuries,
for the range of sentiments, whether set to the often-unpredictable
rhythmic and harmonic turns of John Dowland or the fiery melodies of
Luigi Rossi, could have been at home in a 19th century German lieder
recital.</TE>
<TE>   Hargis' attractive spinto voice handled everything comfortably,
with superb diction and especially potent dramatic power in the Rossi
arias.</TE>
<TE>   Yet this is a true team at work, not just a singer backed by an
instrumentalist, for O'Dette has a whimsical musical personality of
his own.</TE>
<TE>   They seemed to have fun performing together, particularly when
O'Dette irreverently grooved on the rhythms in the closing selection
by Virgilio Mazzochi.</TE>
<TE>   Also, there were frequent solo showcases for O'Dette interwoven
among the vocal selections. From the Rossi pieces onward, O'Dette
switched from the lute to its unwieldy larger relative, the
chitarrone, which the skilled instrumentalist had a devil of a time
keeping in tune on this occasion.</TE>

<LD>Hey, does the name Britney Spears ring a bell? As the producer of
"Crossroads," the pop starlet's debut film that's due in theaters
Friday, Ann Carli knew that you'd have to be locked in a Guantanamo
Bay prison camp to avoid seeing Spears' sultry smile and gyrating
hips.</LD>
<LD>   Britney is everywhere: on magazine covers from Cosmo to Rolling
Stone; "Oprah," "Rosie," "Saturday Night Live" and "The Tonight
Show." Her Pepsi commercials were all over the Super Bowl. And
Britney is flavor of the month on MTV, with wall-to-wall play of her
"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" video and promotions for her film
(which is being released by MTV Films), including a week of
appearances on "TRL."</LD>
<LD>   But knowing Spears' face is one thing; wanting to see her movie is
another. So when teen star Mandy Moore's movie "A Walk to Remember"
opened last month, Carli hung out at the Beverly Center, asking girls
going into the film whether they wanted to see Britney's movie too.</LD>
<TE>   "I was so relieved to hear most of them wanted to go," says Carli,
who was a record company artist development exec before switching
over to making films. "You can interpret tracking information in a
million different ways. I just wanted to ground myself in reality."
When "A Walk to Remember" did an impressive $13.6 million in its
opening weekend, Carli was even more optimistic, since trailers for
Spears' film were playing before nearly every print of the film.</TE>
<TE>   "Crossroads" is more than just an attempt to establish Spears as a
movie star. It's also a fascinating example of how closely
intertwined the worlds of film and the record industry have become,
in large part due to the influence of MTV, which has helped transform
pop music into a visual medium. Not a penny of Spears' $12-million
film came from a movie studio. It's entirely bankrolled by a new wing
of the Zomba Group, whose Jive Records label is home to Spears, the
Backstreet Boys and R. Kelly. Zomba was so eager to team up with MTV
Films and its video channel's promotional machine that Zomba also put
up half of the film's marketing budget.</TE>
<TE>   I'll let the critics review the movie, but it's a respectable
acting debut for Spears, certainly better than those kitschy Pepsi
ads. And its story line--three teen girls rediscovering their
friendship on a cross-country road trip--should appeal to the younger
end of her teen audience. The film looks like a shrewd investment,
both for Zomba, who believes that a thriving film career will prolong
Spears' life as a pop artist and for Spears, who would like to
eventually be viewed as more than just a teen pop tart.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How times have changed. A decade ago, the gods of rock--Nirvana's
Kurt Cobain, Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor, Guns N' Roses' Axl Rose
and Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder--were openly disdainful of movies,
seeing them as uncool and artistically bankrupt. But attitudes have
undergone a startling transformation. Pop music is dominated by a new
generation of teen and hip-hop performers with a far more visual--and
entrepreneurial--approach toward entertainment. They don't share
their rock elders' fear that success equals selling out. Cobain
wouldn't have dreamed of doing a Pepsi commercial; Britney took the
$8 million and ran with it. A host of hip-hop stars, including Sean
"Puffy" Combs, Master P, Dr. Dre and Jay-Z, run their own record
labels and, not coincidentally, have been pursuing second careers in
acting and filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   Movies are a natural fit for hip-hop performers, whose images have
largely been shaped by the characters they play in their videos--and
in real life. After the success of "Exit Wounds," DMX signed a
lucrative three-picture deal at Warner Bros., even though he was in
jail just days before the film's press junket. For his young fans,
his brushes with the law give him far more street-cred as an action
hero than a graybeard like Arnold Schwarzenegger.</TE>
<TE>   Hip-hop stars also have more time to pursue films. Rock bands tour
incessantly: Linkin Park spent 325 days on tour last year. But few
hip-hop artists tour extensively, leaving plenty of time for
moonlighting in films.</TE>
<TE>   Films also have played a bigger role in shaping their artistic
identities. Rap music is full of references to movies, especially
gangster films. "The hip-hop generation grew up on movies," says
manager Benny Medina, who represents Jennifer Lopez and has worked in
the past with Will Smith and Combs. "Film is a natural reference
point, both in their lyrics and in their video images. When you're
out on a hip-hop tour, you can't get on the bus and not find [videos]
of 'Scarface,' 'Heat' and 'The King of New York.'"</TE>
<TE>   Ice Cube is already a movie kingpin, having helped create the
enormously successful series of "Friday" films. Method Man and Redman
just starred in the comedy "How High." LL Cool J has been impressive
in a number of supporting roles--he has a sizable part in
"Rollerball." Jay-Z makes his acting debut with Beanie Sigel in
"State Property," a gangster film opening here March 1.</TE>
<TE>   Eminem will star in "8 Mile," a drama directed by Curtis Hanson
that is slated for release this summer. After having a small part in
"The Fast and the Furious," Ja Rule is doing an action picture with
Steven Seagal and has said his next album will be his last; he wants
to concentrate on acting full time. Everyone has been wooing Alicia
Keys, who's been linked to several film projects, including a "Star
Is Born" remake with Smith.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   But making the transition from music to movies is easier said than
done. It was easy for Sinatra and Elvis, Streisand and Cher, even for
Markie Mark, the teen idol who matured into Mark Wahlberg. It has
been much harder for Madonna, Mick Jagger and Mariah Carey, the
latter of whom had a titanic bomb with "Glitter" last fall. Ditto for
'N Sync heartthrobs Lance Bass and Joey Fatone, whose recent film "On
the Line" failed miserably.</TE>
<TE>   Why do some performers make a seamless transition and others
embarrass themselves? Interscope Records chief Jimmy Iovine, a
producer of "8 Mile," thinks it's all about talent. "It's
simple--some pop stars can act and some can't," he says. But he adds:
"I think you see hip-hop artists making movies because their
sensibility is visual. They don't listen to music, they watch it."</TE>
<TE>   Most pop stars who've failed in film have either brought too much
baggage with them or made music films with
barely-a-step-away-from-reality characters. "There are exceptions
like 'Lady Sings the Blues' [with Diana Ross playing jazz and blues
legend Billie Holiday], but it's always a mistake for someone like
Mariah to play music people," says Rod Stewart manager Arnold
Stiefel, who was a producer of "Midnight in the Garden of Good and
Evil." "The concept doesn't work. It either ends up being too close
to reality or the story is too thin because it's just an excuse to
let the performer play someone like themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Not all musicians have the work ethic needed to be a success in
films. "Whether you come from hip-hop or pop or rock, it's all about
drive, discipline and focus," says Medina. "That's what separates
someone like Ice Cube from a dozen other talented artists. Will Smith
was already becoming the character he played in 'Six Degrees of
Separation' before he even got the part. The ones that make it have a
healthy obsession with challenging themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Having spent 11 years at Zomba Music, where she helped sign
Smith's rap group, DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, Carli was a
perfect point person for Spears' transition to film. After leaving
Zomba, Carli ran Smith's production company, served as executive
producer of the hit "Men in Black" soundtrack and co-produced
"Brother," Takeshi Kitano's critically lauded 2001 gangster movie.</TE>
<TE>   For Carli, it was important to surround Spears with women who'd
done female-oriented projects in the past. Screenwriter Shonda Rhimes
wrote "Introducing Dorothy Dandridge," an Emmy-winning TV movie with
Halle Berry. Director Tamra Davis has made more than 100 music
videos, an Indigo Girls concert film and "Guncrazy," starring Drew
Barrymore.</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, Carli tried to persuade Zomba chief Clive Calder to
make a movie with Smith. He'd passed. But when she proposed a Spears
film, he agreed to finance the entire project. While there's no
soundtrack for the movie, Spears' new CD has three songs from the
film, including her "Not a Girl" hit. The CD also has a three-minute
clip of behind-the-scenes footage from the film. "This wasn't about
helping boost Britney's album sales, though obviously it may help,"
says Carli. "Clive has always been grateful for the role Britney has
played in the growth of his company, and he believed in giving her an
opportunity to start a career in another medium."</TE>
<TE>   Does Britney have what it takes to make it in movies? Carli is
optimistic. "I think a lot of artists look at the success of someone
like Will Smith and think it's easy, but it's not," she says. "It
takes work and talent, but it also takes something more undefinable.
I'd call it the common touch, the thing that allows audiences to
relate to an artist, to make an emotional connection with them. Will
and Ice Cube and Mark Wahlberg all have it. And I think Britney's got
it too."</TE>

<HD>Rhythmists Polish Up Swing Era's Rare Gems</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mora's Modern Rhythmists have the look and the manner of a band
tapped into the recent swing-revival fad. And when the curtain went
up for their program at CSUN's Performing Arts Center on
Sunday--hosted by "The Swingin' Years" radio show disc jockey Chuck
Cecil--the tuxedo-clad players could easily have been kicking off a
dance set at the old Palomar Ballroom.</LD>
<LD>   But bandleader Dean Mora, despite his ebullient manner and
black-and-white wingtip shoes, had other plans in mind. Steering
clear of overly familiar swing-era repertoire--"In the Mood," "String
of Pearls," "Sing, Sing Sing," etc.--he offered a concert sparkling
with intriguing, often unfamiliar items.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the pieces had never made their way to commercial release,
such as an arrangement of "Anything Goes" tracing to a 1935 set of
Benny Goodman numbers recorded solely for radio station use.</LD>
<TE>   Others were almost as elusive: Duke Ellington's 1935 "Bird of
Paradise," for example, was recorded by Jimmie Lunceford rather than
Ellington, and here was performed by the Rhythmists in an arrangement
by the veteran orchestrator Spud Murphy (who was in the audience); a
slightly risque (for 1935) tune from the Dorsey Brothers' repertoire,
"Annie's Cousin Fanny"; Ellington's "I'm Satisfied," with the
original Ivie Anderson vocal sung by band singer Kayre Morrison.</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of the afternoon event, Mora showcased an even more
compelling item: "Reminiscing in Tempo" from 1935, Ellington's first
extended work, impressively rendered by the Rhythmists in its full,
13-minute form.</TE>
<TE>   The musicians did a splendid job of re-creating a far-ranging
lineup of material (all of it tracing to the decade between the late
'20s and late '30s), emulating the style of the period without
sacrificing their own musical individuality.</TE>
<TE>   Mora, on piano, and drummer Larry Wright were especially effective
in focusing the rhythm section, with Chris Tedesco and Jim Ziegler on
trumpet, Dave Bryant on trombone and Matt Germain on tenor saxophone
adding swing-inspired soloing.</TE>
<TE>   But the real fascination of the program centered on the window
that was opened into a colorful era in American jazz and popular
music.</TE>
<TE>   And Mora and his Rhythmists deserve an enormous amount of credit
for reminding us that classic 20th century jazz and swing deserve to
be heard, appreciated and preserved with the same care and
consideration accorded to three centuries of European classical
music.</TE>

<HD>A Mouse Makes Exuberant Leap to Stage</HD>
<DH>The ups and downs of Lilly, a heroine of popular children's
books, are layered with gentle humor for children and adults.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lilly, the self-proclaimed "Queen of Everything," favors cowboy boots
and covers nonexistent bumps and bruises with lots of adhesive strips
because it makes her look brave--and "when I look brave, then I feel
brave."</LD>
<LD>   Lilly, the little mouse heroine in Kevin Henkes' popular
children's books, is making an exuberant leap from the page to the
stage in "Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse," a downright adorable
production from the Kennedy Center's Imagination on Tour company.</LD>
<LD>   It winds up its run today at the Fred Kavli Theatre in Thousand
Oaks, Friday at the James Armstrong Theatre in Torrance and Saturday
at the Haugh Performing Arts Center in Glendora.</LD>
<TE>   In Kevin Kling's comic and heart-filled adaptation, Lilly, kindred
spirit to 5- and 6-year-olds everywhere, isn't so sunny when she
realizes that her new baby brother, Julius, is going to be around
permanently. Sent for a timeout in the "Uncooperative Chair," she
even daydreams that Julius has an unfortunate encounter with a
cat--and she's not sorry.</TE>
<TE>   Things are rosier on her first day at school with adored new
teacher Mr. Slinger, and when Grandma buys her a purple plastic purse
that comes with glamorous red sunglasses, three shiny quarters and
plays music. But then she disrupts class and Mr. Slinger takes it
away.</TE>
<TE>   Storm clouds gather, but with a morning-after air-clearing and a
surprise appreciation for big sister duty, Lilly is her old self.</TE>
<TE>   Catching up with the show at Pepperdine University's Smothers
Theatre, the staging is simple, with Ayun Fedorcha's candy-colored
lighting effects and set designer Tony Cisek's mobile set pieces and
a large framed screen for shadow play. Rock 'n' roll and classical
music selections are cleverly used to comic effect by composer and
sound designer Tony Angelini. Christopher Marlowe Roche did the
whimsical choreography and Howard Vincent Kurtz designed the
lighthearted costumes.</TE>
<TE>   Gentle humor is layered to appeal to both children and adults, and
what's happening as Lilly goes through her ups and downs is deeper
than you'd expect.</TE>
<TE>   Like Lilly's mom (Lynn Blackburn Lush) and dad (Scott Hampton
Cooke), parents with kindergartners will recognize Lilly's big
emotions as she bubbles over with joy, puffs up with indignation,
gets angry, droops with dejection and bounces back again.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Slinger, meanwhile, has a great tip for home: a special corner
with drawing materials where children can vent on paper.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Jerry Manning, and staged for the tour by Elizabeth
Pringle, the show's strong cast makes it lively fun, led by Silinea
Hilliard, who inhabits Lilly's red, tasseled cowboy boots and her
world of endless possibilities with charm and conviction.</TE>
<TE>   "Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse," today at 10 a.m. and noon, Fred
Kavli Theatre, 2100 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd., Thousand Oaks, $10, (805)
388-4411; Friday at 7:30 p.m., James Armstrong Theatre, 3330 Civic
Center Drive, Torrance, $11; groups of five or more, $8.50 a ticket.
(310) 781-7171. Saturday at 1:30 and 3:30 p.m., Haugh Performing Arts
Center, Citrus College, 1000 W. Foothill Blvd., Glendora, $5. (626)
963-9411. Running time: One hour.</TE>

<HD>Turning On the Power</HD>
<DH>DWP's centennial celebration show pays tribute to the
city's diversity with lively acts ranging from gospel to East
L.A.-eclectic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is a multifaceted
entity, what with handling water, electricity and waste disposal. So
it was fitting that it celebrated its 100th anniversary Sunday with a
show at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion honoring the cultural diversity
of the city.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, even the DWP can't cover the whole range of L.A. in a
three-hour show. But Voices for a Green L.A., as the event was
dubbed, gave it a good try, running from the Japanese taiko drummers
performing on the plaza outside the theater beforehand through
several shades of gospel, a pairing of Armenian and Sephardic Jewish
traditions and a rousing closing set by always-eclectic Los Lobos.</LD>
<LD>   With KCAL news anchor Pat Harvey emceeing, the evening featured
brief segments recounting DWP history, boosting its environmental
programs and boasting a little about not being caught off guard by
last summer's energy crisis.</LD>
<TE>   Overall, though, there was as much God and country as water and
power touted Sunday, starting with the patriotic and Christian
inspirational favorites performed by the LADWP Choristers--a
high-quality choir of department employees--in the mezzanine lobby
before the official show began.</TE>
<TE>   That focus reemerged in the main show's commanding performances by
the First African Methodist Episcopal Church's Brookinares Gospel
Choir and contemporary gospel-R&amp;B star Yolanda Adams.</TE>
<TE>   It was left for Los Lobos to tie all the evening's elements
together with a frisky encore of Woody Guthrie's inclusive anthem
"This Land Is Your Land," joined by both Adams and the First AME
chorus. Marking its own 25th year, Los Lobos, even in a scaled-down
set, had already covered a lot of cultural ground, starting with the
acoustic Mexican folk music of its roots and moving through its
vibrant array of rock, R&amp;B and pan-American influences, filtered
through but not limited by the band's distinctively East L.A.
sensibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Adams' set was powered by her stellar voice--naturally pure, full
and agile--and a dynamic personality to match.</TE>
<TE>   Being sandwiched between Adams and Los Lobos would be tough for
anyone, let alone something as unfamiliar to most in the half-filled
house as the pairing of John Bilezikjian, an Armenian American player
of the stringed instrument the oud, with Turkish-born Cantor Haim
Mizrahi, who sings in both Hebrew and the Judeo-Spanish language
Ladino. But the game audience got swept up in the music's exotic,
mournful strains.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd also was delighted by the opening sets, by the
invigorating, seven-woman percussion group ADAAWE and the remarkably
poised and accomplished Los Angeles Children's Choir. Fortunately,
the nominal theme of energy conservation didn't apply to the
high-wattage performers or the enthusiastic audience.</TE>

<LD>   Moss Kirov Design Triggers Opposition</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles-based architect Eric Owen Moss has entered a minefield
with his redesign of St. Petersburg's Mariinsky Theatre--the home of
the esteemed Kirov Opera and Ballet.</LD>
<TE>   The internationally acclaimed Moss, newly appointed director of
the experimentally oriented Southern California Institute of
Architecture, presented his ideas to the Kremlin last week.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Russian President Vladimir Putin will decide whether
his hometown will make the jump from the architecture of the 19th
century to that of the 21st, according to the Sunday Times of London.
If he favors the project, he faces tough opposition from the city's
cultural elite, as well as from local architects and city planners.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an imposition of completely different culture, and not
the best kind of culture," said Oleg Kharchenko, the city's chief
architect. "They say, 'You, who have lived in this city for so long,
your ancestors who created this city, you did it all the wrong way.
The right way is this empty nonsense.'"</TE>
<TE>   The new premises are intended to bring the cramped theater, built
in 1860, in line with international standards and stop Russia opera
singers and ballerinas from defecting to the West. Another goal:
giving St. Petersburg an architectural showpiece along the lines of
London's Tate Modern or Paris' Pompidou Centre.</TE>

<TE>   MUSIC</TE>
<TE>   Vonk Cancels L.A. Performances</TE>
<TE>   Conductor Hans Vonk has canceled his concerts this week with the
Los Angeles Philharmonic.</TE>
<TE>   The Dutch conductor, now in his sixth season as music director of
the St. Louis Symphony, had to halt a concert on Nov. 1 and canceled
his appearances with the orchestra in New York last week because of a
recurrence of Guillain-Barre Syndrome, a central nervous system
disorder that he first experienced in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't want to jeopardize the success of treatment for the
disorder by returning too soon to the podium, according to a
Philharmonic spokesperson. A replacement will be announced today.</TE>

<TE>   MOVIES</TE>
<TE>   UA Bringing 'Nickleby' to the Big Screen</TE>
<TE>   United Artists has given the go-ahead to a new film version of
"Nicholas Nickleby," the classic Charles Dickens novel that only last
month was shown on Bravo in a British television adaptation.</TE>
<TE>   According to Variety, Douglas McGrath ("Emma") will write and
direct, and Charlie Hunnam ("Adaptation") will star. Nathan Lane,
Christopher Plummer and Jamie Bell ("Billy Elliott") have also been
cast in for the film, which is budgeted at less than $10 million.</TE>
<TE>   The story, an eight-and-a-half-hour version of which ran on
Broadway in 1981, tells the story of a destitute orphan whose greedy
uncle (Plummer) finds him a teaching job at a Yorkshire school. He
flees to join a troupe of actors (headed by Lane).</TE>

<TE>   Ian, Dylan Make List of Grammy Hall-of Famers</TE>
<TE>   Janis Ian's "Society's Child" and Bob Dylan's pivotal 1965 rock
album "Highway 61 Revisited" are among the 55 new inductees into the
Grammy Hall of Fame, chosen by a panel of music professionals.</TE>
<TE>   There are 585 titles in the hall, selected because they are
considered timeless and influential forces in music history.</TE>
<TE>   Selections this year ran the gamut in terms of eras and genres.
They include Don McLean's "American Pie," Hank Williams' "Jambalaya
(on the Bayou)," Rufus Thomas' "Walking the Dog," Steppenwolf's "Born
to Be Wild," Marvin Gaye's "Mercy, Mercy" and Leadbelly's folk single
"Goodnight Irene," recorded in 1936.</TE>

spoken-word performance, has been rescheduled for March 14-17 at UCLA
and will include a performance by Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam and a
reunion of the seminal New York band Television.</TE>
<TE>   The traveling British festival of alternative arts had been slated
to visit the Westwood campus in mid-October but was postponed in the
wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Tickets sold for the original
dates will be honored, and more tickets are available through the
UCLA Central Ticket Office.</TE>
<TE>   This year's edition of the festival is curated by the members of
pioneering indie-rock band Sonic Youth, which will perform on the
final day of the event, and other acts include Wilco, Stereolab,
Stephen Malkmus, Sleater Kinney, Aphex Twin and Big Star.</TE>

<HD>Being Gay in a Conservative Environment</HD>
<DH>Movies* A documentary, 'Family Fundamentals,' profiles the
process of three grown children working for acceptance from their
families.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>"Homo milk." Brian Bennett points to the abbreviated store label for
homogenized milk pinned by a magnet to the refrigerator at his Long
Beach home. "I've been drinking homo milk all these years. Yeah, that
must be the reason."</LD>
<LD>   Soft chuckles at the scene punctured the silence of the darkened
theater--a burst of levity during the otherwise somber screening of
"Family Fundamentals," a documentary that debuted last month at the
Sundance Film Festival. Produced by Los Angeles independent filmmaker
Arthur Dong, it depicts the trials of three gay children struggling
for acceptance from their conservative families.</LD>
<LD>   On screen is Bennett, once chief of staff and surrogate son to
former Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), who condemned the gay
"lifestyle" in feverish speeches from the House floor. Bennett's
story is told along with those of a Mormon bishop's gay son and the
lesbian daughter of a Pentecostal minister from San Diego.</LD>
<TE>   Although Bennett's family supported his decision to go public with
his homosexuality in 1997, Dornan accused Bennett of exploiting their
relationship for publicity. He broadcasts a daily radio show from his
Virginia home and didn't respond to Dong's requests to be interviewed
for the film.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not his parents," declared Dornan's wife, Sallie, who said
they had not seen the documentary. "We just don't see him. He took a
life turn. He's chosen a lifestyle."</TE>
<TE>   "I miss him," said Bennett, a Southern California Edison vice
president. "For 20 years, they were my family too. [But] if I didn't
do what I did, I would have been an unhappy, miserable person. My
life is so much better now. I don't think about what my life would
have been like if I hadn't come out but what it could have been like
if I'd only come out earlier."</TE>
<TE>   It was Bennett's ties to Dornan--and public ostracism by the man
Bennett once lovingly called "Poppy"--that led Dong to want to tell
their story. The bond challenged the notion of what constitutes a
family "and I wanted to broaden the parameters of that definition,"
Dong said.</TE>
<TE>   "The other families in the film weren't directly affecting public
policies regarding homosexuality," he said, although their community
activism added to a culture of hostility toward homosexuality.</TE>
<TE>   The filmmaker's past documentaries explored other aspects of
homophobia, including "Coming Out Under Fire," on the treatment of
homosexuals in the military, and "Licensed to Kill," a frank look at
prison inmates convicted of gay-related hate crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "My films are not usually happy endings," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the last four years, Bennett has been busy crafting a happier
ending to a political life that stopped in mid-gasp with his
announcement. In doing so, he has staked a place in politics
arguably more enduring than Dornan himself.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett became one of the Austin 12--a group of gay Republicans
who met with then-Gov. George W. Bush in Texas in April 2000 to push
for tolerance within the party--an unprecedented meeting with a
presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Bennett told Bush that
his longtime partner, an African American Democrat, had "absolutely
no use for the Republican Party" because of its treatment of
minorities and gays.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Bennett helped organize the Republican Unity Coalition,
which held an inaugural breakfast in Washington attended by 400
people, including California GOP Chairman Shawn Steel. Co-hosts of
the first-of-its-kind event were the Republican National
Congressional Committee and its chairman, Rep. Thomas M. Davis
(R-Va.).</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I would have been involved at this level had I not
been an active conservative who happened to be gay," Bennett said.
"Sometimes, when I walk into a room, I feel like there's an element
there who wishes I wasn't there. Mostly I consider it a challenge."</TE>
<TE>   The inroads have not gone unnoticed: In October, the conservative
Family Research Council criticized the Bush administration for
implicitly endorsing the "homosexual political agenda," through
various political appointments and Bush's signing of an
appropriations bill for Washington that funded domestic partner
benefits for gay couples.</TE>
<TE>   Still, to many in the left-leaning crowd at Sundance who saw
Dong's film, Bennett remains in denial about one thing: He's a member
of the wrong party.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how he can be gay and still be a Republican, with
all that they stand for," said Billy Baggett, an activist attorney
from Lake Charles, La., who is featured in a documentary about the
toxic effects of manufacturing polyvinyl chloride.</TE>
<TE>   When told later of the remark, Bennett bristled. "Why should the
gay community write off a whole segment of the population?" he said.
"Change always comes from within."</TE>
<TE>   The political disconnect was palpable after one of the film's many
screenings, when Bennett defended his antiabortion views during a
question-and-answer session.</TE>
<TE>   Medical technology will advance so far, he contends, that
homosexuality soon could be detected before birth and parents could
opt to abort rather than raise a gay child.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could get as many pro-life groups as possible to view
this film," he said. "Right now, most of my fellow conservatives have
created an environment where [no] parent would want to subject their
child to the hatred they'd experience because they're gay or lesbian.
You want that parent to say, 'I want my gay baby.'"</TE>
<TE>   But working from within isn't enough when basic human rights are
at stake, said Bob Mulholland, political director for the California
Democratic Party.</TE>
<TE>   "Under Brian's rationale, blacks would still be in segregated
schools in the South waiting for Southern leaders to change,"
Mulholland said. "If a dog's biting you, you don't stay in the yard
hoping that the dog runs out of bites."</TE>
<TE>   Dong said some leaders within the gay community have criticized
Bennett for fighting to stay within the Catholic Church and the
Republican Party. Indeed, six months after Bennett's announcement, he
flew with his partner to New York City for a reception honoring those
named among the top 50 most influential gays in America. Bennett, who
hadn't seen the Out magazine issue before the reception, was crushed
as he read himself described as a sellout.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who viewed the film at Sundance was a longtime
Republican political consultant and friend of Bennett's who also is
gay--though not publicly so.</TE>
<TE>   He credited Bennett, a member of the state Republican Party
executive committee, for challenging party leadership to meet with
established gay GOP groups.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been continual bashing of gays by Republicans," said
the Los Angeles consultant, who asked not to be named. "It's hard to
blame people for defecting [to the Democrats]. It's been that way for
22 years. Then Bush came along. Things have really moved light years
ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Dong--writer, producer, director and sole publicist on his
film--is working on arranging a limited theatrical release for
"Family Fundamentals" in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York this
year. The film was selected for the Turin International Gay and
Lesbian Film Festival, held in April in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett, ever the optimist, said he'd like to see another film in
Dong's series: "I'd love for Arthur to do a follow-up called 'Common
Ground.'"</TE>

<HD>An Invigorating Trip</HD>
<DH>Some slight yet savvy changes in the James Lapine-Stephen
Sondheim musical 'Into the Woods' serve only to burnish its luster.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I wish."</LD>
<LD>   These restless words are at the beginning and the end of "Into the
Woods," the wise and witty musical by Stephen Sondheim and James
Lapine.</LD>
<LD>   Even after "Into the Woods" opened on Broadway in 1987, wishes
kept cropping up in Lapine's mind, as the librettist and director
thought about the show. His wishing led to an altered version of
"Into the Woods," now at the Ahmanson Theatre, with changes in the
staging and design and a few slightly modified lines.</LD>
<TE>   It would be a cruel irony if Lapine's efforts got him into
trouble. If the characters in this musical learn anything, it's that
desires can backfire when they come true. "Careful the wish you
make," wrote composer-lyricist Sondheim.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Lapine and Sondheim avoided that trap. Most of their
changes make minor improvements in what was already a masterpiece.
Blessed with an impressive cast, this new "Into the Woods" emerges
from the thickets in triumph.</TE>
<TE>   Those thickets can be thorny. By intertwining the familiar tales
of Cinderella, Little Red Ridinghood, Jack and the Beanstalk and
Rapunzel with an original story about a baker and his wife who are
unable to conceive a child, the plot of "Into the Woods" has, over
the years, struck many first-timers as excessively intricate. The
opening number, which introduces the plot strands, requires an
audience to multitask to an unusual degree.</TE>
<TE>   But for those who have seen many productions of the show, the
complexity of the story and the emotions that it stirs up ensure that
there is something fresh to appreciate with each new staging. So the
chance to see a reworking by the original creators is a bonanza.</TE>
<TE>   The simplest yet savviest change in this staging is literally in
the hands of the Witch, played by Vanessa Williams. The Witch has a
powerful second-act number, "The Last Midnight," in which she
expresses her impatience with the dithering of her fellow survivors
in the face of a giant who has just killed her daughter Rapunzel,
among others. Previously, the Witch did little during this number
except sing it.</TE>
<TE>   In Lapine's new staging, the Witch seizes the Baker's baby boy,
whose conception was one of the key achievements of the first act,
and virtually holds the infant hostage while she sings. She addresses
a few of the lyrics directly to the boy and predicts that he, too,
will lose his innocence.</TE>
<TE>   This single stroke adds a chilling dynamism to the song and
provides a splendid climax for Williams' performance, which is indeed
something to see. No offense to the other women who have played this
role, but the transformation from crone to glamour-puss has never
been as stark as it is with the preternaturally gorgeous Williams.
After her metamorphosis, she struts around the stage like a model,
showing off a striking red gown that retains just a suggestion, in
back, of the multi-colored rags she previously wore. If anyone can
embody the flash and pride of this scene, it's Williams. She also has
a strong, supple voice.</TE>
<TE>   The Witch and Rapunzel (Melissa Dye) sing a duet, "Our Little
World," that wasn't in the original production or recording, but it
was added for London and has appeared in subsequent productions, so
it's not exactly new.</TE>
<TE>   Second-billed John McMartin, as the Narrator and the Mysterious
Man, gets some of the latest changes. Unlike past Narrators, he
carries the flocks of Cinderella's bird friends onstage, manipulating
them as a rod puppeteer, even joining in their movements. McMartin
handles the Narrator's newly lighter touch well.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most altered characters is Jack's cow Milky-White,
previously only an inanimate model, sometimes carried like a
suitcase. This made Jack's tender affections for the cow all the
funnier. Now the cow is played by an actor in an elaborate cow suit.
Although remaining on all fours, the cow returns Jack's attentions
with yearning gestures and joins in some of the group dances. Looking
like a nod to Disney cartoon style, this change is more cute than
comic. But the cow delights the crowd, especially the youngest
viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the anthropomorphic department, wolves share the seduction
duties in ''Hello Little Girl,'' leading Little Red Ridinghood
astray. One wolf's attention is diverted by Three Little Pigs, making
their debut in this show and adding a fillip of amusement.</TE>
<TE>   Little Red Ridinghood herself has a few new lines in an exchange
with the Baker's Wife on the subject of marital arguments. But her
biggest change is that, with Molly Ephraim in the role, she looks
like a real and slightly insecure kid, not an adult doing a cartoon
version of a kid. Adam Wylie's fervent Jack also has a clearly
juvenile air--and because Milky-White is now a more authentic pet,
Jack isn't quite as dim as he used to be.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the other human roles haven't changed much. But Stephen
DeRosa and Kerry O'Malley as the Baker and his Wife, the two princes
(and wolves) Christopher Sieber and Gregg Edelman, and Laura Benanti
as Cinderella are all strong. A prerecorded Benanti also plays
Cinderella's mother, who appears as an enlarged projection from
within her tree, the size of the image clarifying the exposition.</TE>
<TE>   Marylouise Burke brings a distinctive crinkliness to the role of
Jack's mother, but on opening night her singing sounded wobbly.
Costume designer Susan Hilferty gave her a funny, flashy outfit in
the second act, paid for by Jack's loot from the Giant--a detail that
slightly bolsters the Giant's case.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Schmidt's woods set, a lush canopy of green, gives way to
barren branches for most of Act 2 but returns in time for the ending.
Other set pieces are built within huge models of old books of fairy
tales. Even Rapunzel's castle now is part of a big book and also
serves as the perch from which the Giant's Wife is finally killed.</TE>
<TE>   The terror of the Giant's Wife is conveyed through shadows and
sounds (the recorded voice of Judi Dench). At the end, we see only
her fallen spectacles. Then the characters sweep the stage, beginning
their lives anew. The parallel to recent world events is never made
explicit, but it won't go unnoticed in this richly textured
production.</TE>

<LD>These are not easy times for America's game-show contestants, those
legions of cockeyed optimists who for decades now have been searching
for shortcuts to Easy Street.</LD>
<LD>   Whereas once a bubbly personality and a knack for genteel parlor
games were all you needed to compete, now a new reality has set in.
In today's game shows, you might be asked to name the "Friends"
coffee shop, but then again, you might be asked to eat a handful of
worms.</LD>
<LD>   "The Chair" (Tuesdays at 8 p.m., ABC), hosted by tennis legend
(and legendary hothead) John McEnroe, asks mainly if you can keep
your cool in the heat of competition. The show combines "Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire" with "Fear Factor" and even a bit of "ER."</LD>
<TE>   Contestants are given a pre-show screening to determine their
resting heart rate, which is used to establish a baseline. Once the
cameras roll, a player takes the hot seat with heart monitor attached
and must answer trivia questions while keeping those heartbeats under
the baseline. The money for each subsequent question goes up as the
baseline goes down.</TE>
<TE>   McEnroe serves up beat-boosting insults and better-hurry-up
admonitions, but there are far more potent "distractions" in store.
Explosions and shooting flames test the resolve of the most steadfast
contestant, but then come the money shots: live animals (hog-tied for
safety) are lowered from the ceiling and left to hover just a whisker
away from contestants.</TE>
<TE>   A rival Fox show, "The Chamber," sued (and was countersued by)
"The Chair" in a dust-up over common elements, but the former show
was pulled off the air last month after just three airings because of
low ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "The Chair," meanwhile, seems to have found an audience,
particularly among the coveted 18-to-34 age bracket.</TE>
<TE>   What would Allen Ludden say?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A solo recital by Anoushka Shankar, daughter of master sitarist Ravi
Shankar, will open the 2002-03 World Stages series presented by the
Irvine Barclay Theatre and the Philharmonic Society of Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   Now 20, the younger Shankar began studying sitar at the age of 9
with her father and made her debut with him at 13 in New Delhi. She
will play a recital at the Irvine theater at 8 p.m. on Oct. 16 as
part of the Eclectic Orange Festival 2002.</LD>
<LD>   The series will continue at the theater:</LD>
<TE>   * Nov. 2: Huun Huur Tu, throat singers of Tuva. The quartet was
formed in 1992 to help preserve the traditional style of xoomei, or
throat-singing, which requires each vocalist to produce two distinct
pitches simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   * Jan. 16, 2003: Habib Koite, Afro-pop guitarist from Mali. Born
into a family of griots, hereditary musician-historians central to
West African musical culture, Koite tunes his guitar to the
pentatonic scale and plays on open strings. Unlike the griots, his
singing style is restrained and intimate.</TE>
<TE>   * March 15: Trinity Irish Dance Group, contemporary Irish dance. A
majority of this Irish American troupe trained at the prestigious
Trinity Academy of Irish Dance, based in Chicago/Milwaukee, which has
graduated a large number of world-class titlists honored at the
annual World Championships of Irish Dance.</TE>
<TE>   * April 1: Music, Dance and Martial Arts of Manipur, India. The
Anjika Manipuri Dance Troupe will be one of several performing from
the northeastern valley of Manipur.</TE>
<TE>   May 3: Orquesta Aragon. Founded in 1939 by bass player Orestes
Aragon, the band became synonymous with the cha-cha rhythm. Several
of the founding members' grandchildren perform in the band.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Series subscriptions, priced at $150 and $174, are on sale now.
Tickets for single events will go on sale later this spring. All
concerts start at 8 p.m. Information: Irvine Barclay Theatre box
office, 4242 Campus Drive, (949) 854-4646; Philharmonic Society,

<HD>Roadside Rests Can Be the Pits</HD>
<DH>Some 100 million travelers use the state's 88 mostly
spartan areas annually. A lawmaker wants to spruce them up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's probably happened to you: You're on a road trip, cruising down
the interstate. You're far enough away from here, but not quite
there.</LD>
<LD>   Then it hits you as suddenly as a blast of wiper fluid on your
windshield. You NEED to stop.</LD>
<LD>   The blue sign with the white letters appears on the horizon--"Rest
Area, Next Exit"--and your mind may fill with competing thoughts: OK,
finally, toilets and a drinking fountain. But will they be clean? I
can stretch my legs. But will there be more than a patch of shade?
Or, if it's night, will there be enough lighting, or people, around
so I don't feel like I'm about to become a victim in my own horror
flick?</LD>
<TE>   Each year, about 100 million travelers looking for rest and relief
stop at the 88 rest areas scattered throughout California, according
to the state Department of Transportation.</TE>
<TE>   What they find at those freeway pit stops is often spartan,
outfitted with only the most basic necessities: toilets and sinks
inside a bare, cinder-block structure. No paper towels, no vending
machines. The truly deluxe rest stops offer picnic areas with scenic
views, snacks and plenty of parking for recreational vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   It can be hit or miss when it comes to the roadside retreats--so
much so that one lawmaker has suggested that the way stations need a
little sprucing up, care of the private sector.</TE>
<TE>   But in rest stops, as in life, everything is relative. And the man
who wrote the book on the topic says California's freeway pit stops
are actually among the best in the West.</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Hammon has written three versions of the "Rest Area Guide,"
each covering a separate portion of the West.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some that are pretty basic, but if you've got to go,
that's all you need," he said. "I think California rest areas are
pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   Hammon, a retiree and freelance writer, spent a year visiting
every rest area in the state with his wife. The facilities are ranked
on a scale of one to four toilets, four signifying the finest
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Hammon said he would rank California rest stops among the top four
of 11 Western states for cleanliness, available parking, restroom
crowding, and amenities such as telephones and vending machines.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes low expectations and a desperate bladder can make even
the state's most austere rest stops look like sparkling oases.</TE>
<TE>   "They're pretty clean compared to other places," said Eric Donaty,
a Los Angeles dentist and frequent road-tripper. "They're well kept
up."</TE>
<TE>   The state spends about $11.3 million a year on rest-area upkeep.</TE>
<TE>   "Vandalism and litter are not big problems," Caltrans spokesman
Gene Berthelsen said. "Most people appear to stop and throw their
trash into the receptacles."</TE>
<TE>   Hammon did note one litter problem that appeared in several
restrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "For God's sake, use a roll of toilet paper, not the individual
sheets," he said. "They make a huge mess when someone pulls out
handfuls at a time. They wind up all over the floor."</TE>
<TE>   California's first rest area was created in 1962. It and the
dozens of freeways stopovers that would follow were constructed for
the short term.</TE>
<TE>   "Many were built on a 20-year plan," Caltrans spokesman Dennis
Trujillo said. "Many rest areas have gone beyond their life and
design."</TE>
<TE>   That's why Caltrans is planning face lifts for 17 rest areas over
the next four years. Renovations are underway at two rest areas. Work
at Desert Oasis on Interstate 40 in San Bernardino County should be
completed sometime this spring. And Willows on Interstate 5 in
Northern California's Glenn County is scheduled to reopen the first
week in April.</TE>
<TE>   Desert Oasis and Willows go a long way toward evoking the proper
sense of refuge and restoration.</TE>
<TE>   But, ironically, Donner Summit--scene of 19th century pioneer
cannibalism--is one of California's loveliest rest areas. Hammon
calls it a "destination rest area," a place where travelers might
choose to stop just for the scenery.</TE>
<TE>   The name Alpha Omega gives no clue as to what one might find. On
California 20 in Nevada County, it is the state's worst, in Hammon's
estimation.</TE>
<TE>   "It was comical," he said. "We would watch people step in [to the
restrooms] and then step right back out."</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to change the nature of the rest areas have met with
little success. Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) has called the stops
"unsanitary and unsafe."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Inland Empire lawmaker asked Congress to consider
altering standard rest area parameters. He sponsored legislation for
a pilot program that would allow commercial development--perhaps
fast-food restaurants and gas stations--at a few of the sites.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the proposal noted that commercialization could save
the state money by making the businesses responsible for upkeep.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law now prohibits commercial uses at the rest stops, and
Lewis' proposal died in Congress. Plans to revive it next year are up
in the air.</TE>
<TE>   With or without private enterprise, Caltrans is trying to respond
to complaints such as those of the congressman.</TE>
<TE>   To make travelers feel safer, parking spaces for California
Highway Patrol officers will be added at each area, providing a place
where officers can park and do their paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   "It's to create a law enforcement presence to reduce vandalism or
any potential hooliganism," said Caltrans spokesman Berthelsen.</TE>
<TE>   The state agency doesn't keep statistics on the number and type of
crimes that occur at rest areas, but Berthelsen said he thinks there
are few.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't assuage all drivers' fears.</TE>
<TE>   "Anywhere you go, [safety] is a concern," Donaty said. "It enters
your mind at nighttime, but a lot of other places are closed at that
hour." So travelers might have no alternative but to keep their eyes
on the horizon, looking for the next blue sign.</TE>
<TE>   Other states provide formal security service. In Texas, for
example, guards patrol while weary travelers sleep in their cars
overnight.</TE>
<TE>   California discourages travelers from spending the night at rest
areas.</TE>
<TE>   The facilities "are designed for about a 20-minute stop,"
Berthelsen said. "If we get people camping out, that will reduce [the
rest areas'] capacity."</TE>
<TE>   Truck drivers are the exception, however. "They do need to stop
and rest for long periods of time," Berthelsen said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, California has a shortfall of about 8,100 spaces
statewide for truck parking. It's a problem that Caltrans hopes to
correct, in part, with auxiliary lots at rest areas designed
specially for truck parking.</TE>
<TE>   If Caltrans officials are seeking more creative ideas to jazz up
their rest areas, they need only look a few states east.</TE>
<TE>   At New Mexico's Las Cruces Overlook on Interstate 10, travelers
can find inspiration, or amusement, in the towering roadrunner that
stands just beyond the standard restrooms. The representation of the
New Mexico state bird was constructed from trash salvaged from a Las
Cruces landfill.</TE>
<TE>   Also at the site, the state expresses its concern for
accommodating drivers. A sign asks visitors to decide whether the
stopover meets their needs and then register their opinions by
pushing one of two buttons, labeled "yes" and "no."</TE>
<TE>   Some Southern states, including Alabama, Mississippi and Texas,
offer grand welcome centers on their borders, providing travel
information and, in some cases, a taste of what the state has to
offer. Entering Florida, you just might be handed a cup of orange
juice.</TE>

<HD>Looking Back With the Director of 'Stunt Man'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GINA PICCALO AND LOUISE ROUG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Rush looks down on the San Fernando Valley twinkling beneath
the King Air airplane. These days, flying to Santa Barbara for the
afternoon is a rare treat for the 71-year-old director, who recently
gave up his Cessna for health reasons. Flying used to be the perfect
hobby, he says. "There are enough life and death concerns to take
your mind off work."</LD>
<LD>   And work has been a mixed bag for Rush. His defining moment, "The
Stunt Man," was his greatest success--and his greatest
disappointment.</LD>
<LD>   Now, 20 years after its release, the movie weighs on his mind
again. As part of a recently released DVD of the film, Rush
co-produced a documentary called "The Sinister Saga of Making the
Stunt Man," which tells the story of a movie that garnered three
Academy Award nominations but never found an audience.</LD>
<TE>   The saga in brief: It took nine years for the film, which stars
Peter O'Toole and Barbara Hershey, to make it to the big screen.
Then, when it did, the studio wasn't interested in promoting it, or
releasing it widely, Rush says, telling a familiar Hollywood story,
"and it slipped through the cracks."</TE>
<TE>   His 1980 film is "a movie about moviemaking and what is crazy
about our lives," Rush says over lunch. "There's an irresistible
metaphor in the movie about our universal paranoia. The [dread] you
feel when you realize your secretary had lunch with your boss, and
you don't know what they talked about."</TE>
<TE>   Growing up, Rush didn't aspire for a career in Hollywood. His
ambitions were loftier: He wanted to be first on the moon. Studying
astronomy and physics, however, Rush was felled by math and decided
that "science would have to stumble along without me." After odd jobs
in advertising and photography, he began making movies, a process he
calls "athletic."</TE>
<TE>   Directing "is too strenuous an event to attempt to have a heart,"
he jokes. "The true meaning of final cut is when they cut you in the
chest for the bypass."</TE>
<TE>   Is he bitter that "The Stunt Man" didn't soar? "It was difficult
at the time," he says, "but the opportunity was the best thing that
ever happened to me ... I feel I got away with a big one."</TE>
<TE>   From an Expert</TE>
<TE>   Porn star Nina Hartley will be the guest of honor at a Santa
Clarita synagogue this month as part of Temple Beth Ami's adult
education series. On Feb. 19, Hartley, who appeared in the film
"Boogie Nights" and has starred in more than 570 adult films, offers
"Love &amp; Sex in the 21st Century," a free lecture on the porn industry
that also features sex tips for monogamous couples.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Mark Blazer said he invited Hartley to participate in the
lecture series after meeting her through a mutual friend. Her
appearance will broaden his congregation intellectually, he said. "My
goal as a rabbi is to push the envelope," Blazer said. While Temple
Beth Ami is located in a conservative community, the members of the
reform Jewish congregation are very open-minded, Blazer said, and no
one has expressed any concern that Hartley's presence will be
offensive. "Part of Judaism is to engage and learn about as much of
the world as we can--not to be closed to the world," he said. "This
is really an opportunity that most people would never have."</TE>

<TE>   Michael York stands at a podium, surrounded by books, and checks
his watch. He looks up, and with Elizabethan grace says to his
audience: "Ever at my back, I hear time's winged chariot."</TE>
<TE>   On this Thursday night, York is at Book Soup in West Hollywood to
read from his new book, "Dispatches From Armageddon: Making the Movie
'Megiddo.'" And when he takes questions from the audience, the
answers are more often than not dispatches from the masters. Does he
share the religious beliefs of "Megiddo: Omega Code II's" funder,
Trinity Broadcasting Network in Orange County? "We are drowned in the
trivial," York replies, quoting Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard.
Then he dips into George Bernard Shaw, recalling one of the Irish
dramatist's characters, who said of religions: "The trouble is, I
believe in all of them."</TE>
<TE>   Is there a videotaped version of his long-ago portrayal of Pontius
Pilate, someone asks. "Heard melodies are sweet," says York, taking
his script from Keats, "but those unheard are sweeter."</TE>
<TE>   And why did his 1992 autobiography carry different titles in
England ("Travelling Player: An Autobiography") and in the United
States ("Accidentally on Purpose," Simon &amp; Schuster)? Here, Shaw's
words suffice: "Two countries divided by the same language."</TE>

<LD>BREAKING CLEAN</LD>
<LD>   By Judy Blunt</LD>
<LD>   Alfred A. Knopf</LD>
<TE>   320 pages; $24</TE>
<TE>   Like her parents and grandparents before her, Judy Blunt was
raised to live amid the austere terrain of eastern Montana. "I could
rope and ride and jockey a John Deere as well as my brothers," she
writes of her childhood in "Breaking Clean," a spare, sharp-eyed
memoir, "but being female, I also learned to bake bread and can
vegetables and reserve my opinion when the men were talking."</TE>
<TE>   Blunt's account, punctuated by storytelling ability as vast as the
Montana sky, recounts her rustic upbringing and life as a rancher's
wife on a land where the hardpan and sagebrush flats give way to the
Missouri River Breaks, "a country so harsh and wild and distant that
it must grow its own replacements, as it grows its own food, or it
will die." Hers is a panoramic tale of the American West, of
backbreaking work and simple pleasures, of the teeth-gritting
determination necessary in the face of terrible odds and the
blessings and curses of nature.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, it is the story of being defined by one's environment
up to a point, and then refusing to be defined by those constraints
any further. In Blunt's case, that means eventually leaving this life
for the big-city life of Missoula.</TE>
<TE>   Though Blunt was born in 1954, the memoir she limns might as well
be from the 1800s. Her first home offered no electricity and no
running water; the two-room shanty was "20 from the outhouse and a
dozen miles from a telephone." The childhood she describes comes
together as a luminous mosaic of horses and cattle, ranch dogs and
chickens, family roles and expectations defined by gender, and
responsibility hoisted onto slender shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   The stultifying limitation of "women's work," which for years
harnessed her roaming imagination and superb ranch-hand abilities, is
the thread throughout the memoir. Though Blunt was diligent at
birthing calves, for example, the men often sent her away, preferring
to pull the "calves in the early stages of labor rather than lose
sleep or daylight." Even the smallest token of self-realization was
suspect. She saved for three years to buy a typewriter on which she
composed when the family was asleep and all the chores done--until
the day she was late putting lunch on the table for the hay crew, and
her father-in-law "took my warm, green typewriter to the shop and
killed it with a sledgehammer." It is the utter lack of blame that
makes the tale come alive.</TE>
<TE>   Following these gender roles was how families survived, Blunt
tells us. When nature threatens from every side, there's no room for
attention to one's personal needs. The family and community must work
together--or perish.</TE>
<TE>   This ethos is most clearly seen when Blunt's 19-month-old daughter
was overcome one night by a quickly rising fever. The rains had
turned the roads to "gumbo," making the two-hour-plus journey over
muddied landscape to medical care an enormous risk in itself. When
the child's temperature hit 106 and convulsions began, the couple had
no choice but to travel. Reading this account, one is struck by the
abiding sense of community, the pulling together that made survival
possible.</TE>
<TE>   The young couple bounced on their precarious way, their daughter
clenched in the throes of febrile contortions, encouraged by
neighbors spread over the miles who had come out to show support. The
ranchers stood in the dark amid lashing rain, their truck lights
illuminating the next section of the road the young couple was to
navigate. "Word had gotten out," Blunt writes in her distinctively
understated tone. "The lights blinked once, like a nod. Good luck.
Safe journey....They stood silhouetted, one in front of each pickup."
Yet, after a time, this pull-together-or-perish way of life can drain
even the most hearty. A female college professor who lodged with
Blunt was perplexed as to how she managed. Could she go to town for a
movie or a dinner if she wanted to, the guest wondered, or get some
quiet time without her children? The woman clearly didn't understand
ranch life--it was never a matter of what one wanted. The visiting
woman's ideas of self-care, Blunt realized, were like those found in
ladies' magazines. "Take Care of Yourself First" articles applied to
her about as much as "Office Wear--How to Dress for Power." In
"Breaking Clean," Blunt strikes a delightfully tense, unsteady
balance and yet masterfully maintains it throughout a wild-ride of a
memoir. Like an accomplished bucking bronco rider, she gives us
untenable flashes of equilibrium even as they evaporate--the
stability of communal life one moment, the price such a way of life
extracts the next--never allowing readers to forget that on an
eastern Montana ranch, the advantages of one are based in the
restrictions of the other.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Rev. Wilbert Awdry wrote his first book about Thomas the Tank
Engine in England in 1945. Since then, generations of children have
grown to love the cheeky engine and his friends who live on the
Island of Sodor.</LD>
<LD>   Awdry was a retired Anglican clergyman who had a passionate
interest in railways. As a little boy in Box, Wiltshire, he would lie
in bed at night and listen to the trains of the Great Western Railway
running along the main line from Paddington to Bristol within 200
yards of his house. He imagined the engines talking to one another
and invented characters for them all.</LD>
<LD>   He first made up stories about Thomas and his friends in 1943 to
keep his son Christopher amused when he was ill with the measles.
Edmund Ward, a retired businessman who was looking for a diversion,
published the books. They were so successful that Ward was forced to
come out of retirement to handle the high demand.</LD>
<TE>   After 26 books, Awdry decided he could write no more, so his son
Christopher, for whom the stories were first created, took up the
series. Christopher began writing the books when his son Richard was
3--the same age as Christopher when his father started the railway
series. It is through Christopher's efforts that more than 40 more
stories were added to the increasingly popular series.</TE>
<TE>   The timeless charm of the Awdrys' works have made Thomas the Tank
Engine one of the most loved children's characters. The books can be
found in more than 135 countries around the world.</TE>
<TE>   California fans will be able to meet Thomas the Tank Engine when
the train pulls into local railroad stations in Sacramento, Fort
Bragg and Perris during the first national "Day Out With Thomas"
tour.</TE>

<HD>Gentlemen Take a Step Back in Time</HD>
<DH>Lines by Sean Combs, John Bartlett and others return to

<SE></SE>
<AU>NEW YORK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--Leave it to Sean "P. Diddy" Combs to jolt fashion out of a
subdued, reflective mood with an extravagant dose of runway--and
off-the-runway--theatrics. The 32-year-old rap mogul, a.k.a. Puff
Daddy, threw a multimillion dollar runway show and party for his Sean
John men's line Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   The bash, in the banquet hall of the Cipriani restaurant, cost an
estimated $1.24 million, and featured male models parading on the
runway in more than $1 million worth of antique jewelry from Fred
Leighton in Beverly Hills. Backstage after the show, a gate crasher
was tossed onto 42nd Street by guards.</LD>
<LD>   While his presentation was over the top, Combs showed conservative
clothes. The looks were decidedly gentlemanly--Cary Grant and Fred
Astaire--a marked departure from last fall's "super bad, super fly"
fur looks. Other menswear designers, who showed during the first
three days of Fashion Week, also took a nostalgic approach in
classic--and safe--country looks and outdoorsy clothes with a vintage
look.</LD>
<TE>   Combs' pre-show festivities, complete with front-row celebrities
Jessica Alba, Tara Reid, the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Anthony Keidis
and several rap artists, was more like a Hollywood movie premiere
with a throng of camera-toting tourists, onlookers and the paparazzi
on the street behind red velvet ropes. Inside, partyers gathered in a
VIP room before the show, several taking bottles of champagne with
them to their runway seats of hardwood that were especially built for
the show, along with a matching runway. White theatrical drapes, also
created for production, covered the walls of the hall with its high,
ornate ceilings.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when other designers are scaling back in a city healing
from the terrorists attacks and grappling with a difficult retail
environment, Combs' lavish entertainment included a commissioned
video about New York, old time Hollywood, jazz singers of yesteryear
and family photographs (the show was dedicated to his father, Melvin
Combs who died when Sean was 3 years old). Often, guests rose to
their feet and applauded the images of Billie Holiday, Louis
Armstrong and Josephine Baker that flashed on the screen to
background music loud enough to make your socks fall to you ankles.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to represent New York and show the fashion world that
Sean John loves New York! This is my New York fashion week state of
mind. I'm a different man than I was a year ago," he exclaimed
backstage after the show, referring to having been cleared last year
of alleged gun possession and bribery charges by a Manhattan jury.
Even then in the midst of the trial he staged a $1-million show, the
first show at Bryant Park to be broadcast live on E! Entertainment
and Style networks.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, added Combs, who does not design the line, "I scaled back
on the logos," a reference to his earlier collections of hip-hop
wear. His fashion direction, like his life, he said, has changed.
Gone are the past "gansta" uniform looks of baggy pants and
logo-emblazoned jackets and the extravagant furs of last fall, often
worn by bare-chested models. This time around, models were covered
from head to toe in a collection that has morphed from street wear to
town-and-country sophisticate with a hip Gatsby look--scarves,
jackets, belted trench coats and oversized newspaper boy caps--mostly
in solid colors from chocolate and camel to burgundy and red, and in
luxurious fabrics such as cashmere, suede, silk and velvet.</TE>
<TE>   Ivy League looks dominated with V-neck sweaters, French cuff
shirts, vests, blazers and paisley and striped ties. But even a rap
artist has to break loose and there were a few over-the-top, yet
elegant exceptions, including the show's finale--a brooch-adorned
burgundy, floor-length velvet and cashmere cutaway coat and matching
trousers that brought the audience, estimated at 1,000, to its feet.
Throughout the show, guests shouted their appreciation for the
clothes as if they were at a church revival.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Combs said, "I didn't think my show was ostentatious. I
feel that fashion needed some flavor. It's time for men to play dress
up, time for a sense of beauty in men's fashion." The Sean John line
had sales of more than $200 million in 1,200 stores last year and is
a staple among the Phat Farm, Fubu and Ecko hip-hop nation wearing
crowd.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of Combs, the other men's shows were low-key,
including John Bartlett's. Last September he presented his collection
three days before the attacks in the cavernous New York State Armory
in an artsy installation with half-dressed models in prison cells
that had more than 1,000 guests walking around in the dark and
tripping over each other. This time he staged a quaint runway show in
the sun-filled Boylan Studios in midtown Manhattan with slightly more
than 200 guests.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted my show to be more grass-roots and homey. There's a
sense of humility among many in the industry right now," he said
after his show of simple garments he described as clothes "that men
really wear."</TE>
<TE>   That included mostly outdoorsy looks: red and black plaid
lumberjack-styled shirts, thermals, quilted vests and varsity bomber
jackets and denim jeans tucked inside laced-up duck hunting boots.
Velvet, corduroy and moleskin fabrics dominated with a few
houndstooth blazers thrown in. He said the collection's idea came to
him after poring over an old Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. catalog he inherited
from his first job at then Williwear.</TE>
<TE>   At Tommy Hilfiger's show, nautical, prep school and American
country looks dominated, often all three looks layered upon each
other, almost as if the designer stood in front of racks of clothes,
closed his eyes and pointed here, there and everywhere to create
ensembles. Officer's coats and boot-cut pants were simple and basic.
Varsity jackets, toggle coats, argyle sweaters and tailored suit
coats mixed with track pants and plaid button-down shirts. He used
the usual New England fall foliage colors.</TE>
<TE>   "The season is about the classics in a feel-good way," Hilfiger
said after his show. "It's about clothes that are homey and relaxed,
that feeling you get when you bundle-up in your favorite sweater."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Kay, the designer for Perry Ellis, played it safe with a
wearable collection notable for a variety of coats: shearling car
coats, duffel coats, wool peacoats and cashmere double-breasted
overcoats. Suede zippered jackets as well as zippered sweaters were
teamed with slim pants in velvet, corduroy and cotton herringbone. A
slate of velvet outfits stood out including tuxedo jackets, black
vests and piped trousers.</TE>
<TE>   Models for the show included "real New Yorkers," men born and
reared in the city or transplants who have made it their own. Among
them were Simon Doonan, creative director of Barneys New York; Tom
Broecker, costume designer for "Saturday Night Live"; menswear
designer Gene Meyer, and Tony Fortuna, dubbed the city's best
maitre'd, who works at Lenox Room Restaurant and once worked at the
Hotel Bel Air in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Chereskin turned his showroom into a ski lodge for a
collection he said was inspired by the Olympics: bulky wool sweaters
in turquoise and red with matching scarves, puffy ski jackets teamed
with corduroy pants and soft cashmere sweaters. "Stores are having a
tough time right now which is why designers have to be more
inventive," Chereskin said. "This isn't the time for trendy clothing.
It's time for an Americana, get-back-to-the country look--something
that is recognizable and familiar to men."</TE>
<TE>   A few days before the show, Michael Kors chatted with a reporter
at his showroom about his first menswear line. The luxury sportswear
collection, which he will debut with his women's collection
Wednesday, includes boot-cut pants, cashmere suits and sweaters,
quilted leather jackets, shearling and fur coats, and corduroy and
denim jeans fashioned after ski wear.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted the clothes to feel casual but also luxurious, like
taking the granddad out of the granddad sweater," he said about the
line that is a masculine version of his women's wear--modern and
classic.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Cole, whose past collections have been a cross between
yuppie and slacker looks, also went with a country look with a
collection of outdoorsy layered combinations, including chunky
hand-knit sweaters, soft cotton shirts, tweed vests and velour
overcoats--most everything in a warm, earthy palette of gold,
cinnamon and burgundy pastels. Tweed pinstriped suits and corduroy
tuxedos had an urban appeal.</TE>
<TE>   A key element of his collection were slim leather pants, all
distressed, in greens, blues and grays, looking casual and well-worn,
almost vintage, especially with the square-toed cowboy boots on just
about every model.</TE>
<TE>   Cole paid homage to New York at the start of his show staged at
his company's showroom on West 10th Street, with a short film of the
Manhattan skyline and the city's neighborhoods mixed with several
messages from his new ad campaign. The designer is known for
campaigns that touch on social issues such as AIDS, violence against
women and the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   "On Sept. 12 fashion was the last thing on our minds," came the
first message as guests sat silently, many whispering their
discontent at the designer tying in the tragedy to ring up sales.
Others were saddened by the film.</TE>
<TE>   "We were captivated by role models, not supermodels," continued
the film. "Red white and blue became the new black. Slowly we are
returning to business as usual. But is it slow enough?" And finally,
read the last message: "On September 12 we were reminded life is not
a dress rehearsal."</TE>

<HD>Nurturing an Anorexia Obsession</HD>
<DH>'Pro-ana' Web sites tout the eating disorder as a choice,
not an illness, to the horror of experts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNELL GEORGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At first, peering into her computer screen, Janice Saunders was
struck by the eerie triptychs: jutting hipbones, a blade of clavicle,
a rib cage in relief.</LD>
<LD>   A double click brought her to message boards full of wild chatter
and ghoulish advice: "Worried about that side of fries last night?
Swallow half a bottle of laxatives!" "At a plateau? Try syrup of
ipecac, what they use at hospitals for accidental poisoning. This
helps to purge the body."</LD>
<LD>   With each left-click, each move of the mouse, a murky world came
more clearly into focus.</LD>
<TE>   "It is so great to feel lean and pure and clean. Thats why I'm
promoting Anorexia, although I don't think it should be labeled a
'disease.' It's not like that. Ana gives comfort, control, beauty.
Everything that a girl could ask for."</TE>
<TE>   Pro-anorexia? Anorexia as a desirable choice? At first, she says,
still sounding a bit bewildered, "I thought it was a joke. I thought
I was misreading."</TE>
<TE>   But as she explored, Saunders, who has been running her own Web
site, Support Concern and Resources for Eating Disorders, or SCARED,
out of her home in London, Ontario, found scores of
pro-anorexia--"pro-ana"--sites. Deeply disturbing pages aimed at
anorexics and bulimics were filled with tips on how to protect tooth
enamel from frequent episodes of purging, 2 a.m. "no-excuses"
exercise regimes and photos that flaunted a death-camp aesthetic of
skin and bones.</TE>
<TE>   Her early explorations became a vigil. Every day she gets up at
4:30 a.m. and goes to her computer to track the activity on her
site--and the others. The voices haunt her. "I live with Mia, but Ana
comes to visit occasionally, " says one posting. "I no longer hide
Ana from anyone," confesses another.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I hate Mia and I want Ana more than anything."</TE>
<TE>   "Mia"--bulimia nervosa--and "Ana"--anorexia nervosa--are the two
most tenacious eating disorders. Once, many anorexics and bulimics
tended to isolate themselves, say experts who have been helping
clients wrestle with these complex conditions for decades. But as
Saunders discovered, that is beginning to change. Within the fluid
anonymity of the Internet, a new generation has made its eating
disorders a unifying badge and, ultimately, a way to bond in a
dangerous pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   "They see this as something [to be] cherished," Saunders explains.
"They tell one another that it is going to give them happiness: It's
a place where they can make friends."</TE>
<TE>   In this realm, "support" or "advice" doesn't mean referrals to
doctor's care or tips for recovery. Rather, the hundred or so Web
logs--or blogs--loops, diaries and online pro-ana communities nurture
their visitors' consuming obsession with extreme thinness.</TE>
<TE>   One click away from the "Thin Commandments" is the "Ana Creed": "I
believe in Control, the only force mighty enough to bring order to
the chaos that is my world." And just a hyperlink away from that are
rated lists of "recommended" over-the-counter diet pills, supplements
and laxatives. The sites, say eating-disorder experts, pose grave
dangers to their most vulnerable visitors and a new set of roadblocks
to those who try desperately to treat them.</TE>
<TE>   "Anorexics tend to be a competitive bunch," says Jenn Berman, a
Beverly Hills-based therapist who daily sees the eating disorders
that take hold arise in the driven athletes and actresses she treats.
"So reading that someone lost X amount of pounds just ups their
activities. It's one of the reasons that group therapy isn't
recommended. Anorexics try to outdo each other--in illness, not in
success."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The pro-ana community is well-known to those who work with
anorexics and bulimics. Saunders heard about it when a young girl
battling an eating disorder visited her SCARED page and told her
about the sites she had run into en route. Saunders was immediately
concerned because she knew how powerfully women are drawn to the
Internet as they seek self-help tips.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, she had launched a Web page to help herself deal
with depression and offer a forum to others and was surprised to see
how many of her regular visitors sought help with eating disorders.
SCARED evolved to support them.</TE>
<TE>   Saunders wanted to see the new pro-ana sites for herself. She took
to sitting on a few mailing lists, using names such as SkinnyMini.
And in no time she began receiving daily e-mail reminders: "Remember.
Do not eat today." Or a nudge to recite one of the Thin Commandments:
"Thou shall not look at food."</TE>
<TE>   She jumped in with counter-arguments--sometimes riling others
enough to get kicked out of various rooms and lists. Then, last year,
she began running across postings that pushed her beyond chat room
spats. "One of the girls," she recalls, "was telling girls to cut off
the fat off their bodies with a serrated knife! Take a pile of
laxatives!'"</TE>
<TE>   The mother of four daughters in their early to mid-teens, she
asked herself: "Do I want [them] to read this? There are girls who
are spending their money and busting their butts to get help, and
this is what they are coming across."</TE>
<TE>   Saunders contacted Internet service providers, demanding that the
sites be shut down for offering content that harms minors. No
response. Eventually, though, her protests, along with those of
others who had begun to informally organize on her site, got
attention. Last summer, Saunders returned from a vacation to find her
online mailbox overflowing with messages, their subject lines
rejoicing: "We won!" or "Congratulations! They've closed the sites!'
I thought, 'Oh my God! That's great!'"</TE>
<TE>   But in just a few short weeks, the pro-ana pages were back--all
over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Again and again, under slightly altered names or camouflaged by
coded keywords, these sites and their Webmasters rebuild and
resurface, sometimes slightly disguised, but each time more
emboldened. "They are fighting a losing battle," one Webmaster
recently wrote. "I will just keep showing up."</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, the battle was joined by such health care
professionals as Holly Hoff, director of programs for the National
Eating Disorders Assn., based in Seattle. Her organization's efforts
paralleled Saunders', as her group sent letters to Yahoo and other
service providers that were hosting the sites. Yahoo took note in
August and was the first to begin closing pro-ana sites and clubs,
citing their harmful or threatening content. Other service providers
followed suit. But again, the sites reemerged elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Many eating-disorders specialists see shadings of their patients'
complex profile in the Webmasters' tenacity.</TE>
<TE>   Frequently, says Hoff, anorexics and bulimics "tend to be women
who are perfectionists, goal-achieving. They are the good students,
the good child, the good mate, the good friend." So the doggedness
fits the profile.</TE>
<TE>   "These sites illustrate an extreme representation of the illness,"
says Margo Maine, a Connecticut-based therapist and author of "Body
Wars: Making Peace With Women's Bodies" (Gurze Books, 1999). "More
than just a diagnosis, it becomes their total identity, this badge of
illness."</TE>
<TE>   Extremely Ana, Tiny Dancer, Stick Figures, Only Popular
W/Anorexia, Wanna B Skinny, Thinspiration and Dying for Perfection
are just a few Web sites that have recently been shuttered or slipped
from plain sight. Of the sites that remain, some are zine-like blogs
with a tumble of busy graphics that recall inky notebook doodlings or
hasty post-punk cut-and-paste locker collages. Others are crowded
chat rooms or hyperlinked Web rings. Compulsion, and a desperate,
unattainable desire for control, are everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "I ate 780 calories the other day and I still feel like I want to
die, (I wrote 'fat pig' on my left leg in marker, that seemed to help
a bit), so I went home and went running at 2:30 a.m. About 7 miles I
try to maintain a sense of balance."</TE>
<TE>   With their misspellings, muddy graphics or stream-of-consciousness
entries, some of these sites may look amateurish--even harmless. But
therapists are already seeing alarming evidence of their effects.
Their casual tone and imperfections, like a voice of a friend, are,
in fact, their power.</TE>
<TE>   And that easy intimacy drowns out the concerns of friends,
therapists and families in the minds of those with eating disorders.</TE>
<TE>   "Right away you see the skepticism," says therapist Berman, bent
over the laptop propped open on her office desk, a page open to
Friday night action on one pro-ana site. The boards are alive;
postings arrive every few minutes. Their hyperactivity, says Berman,
is part of the compulsive profile: Some posts flame a TV drama's
depiction of bulimia--sight unseen. Others complain about doctor
visits or stew over a concerned husband's attempt to force a
meal--"at least a chicken nugget.""There's a real we-versus-them
aspect," Berman says. "But all these people want to be thin as
opposed to being well."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the sites paint "Ana as lifestyle" in vivid brushstrokes:
Waif as elegant aesthetic; willpower as mark of strong character.</TE>
<TE>   This sort of argument marks the first phase of the illness, says
Ali Borden, primary therapist at the Monte Nido Treatment Center in
Calabasas. "When they start in on an eating disorder," says Borden,
"they are completely unaware of the effects. They think that they
will be thin, loved, successful, popular--which seems to be the stage
that the people running the sites are totally locked in. But suddenly
they realize: I feel tired, I'm not seeing my friends anymore, I feel
weak, I feel sick. But then they think: Well that must mean I'm not
working hard enough. I need to work harder."</TE>
<TE>   As they do, they face realities of a body deprived of food. Hair
thins. Bones snap. Organs give out.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 5 million to 10 million American women in
post-puberty struggle with some form of eating disorder, says Hoff.
And without intervention, Berman notes, anorexia has the highest
fatality rate in the DSM-IV, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Assn. That's
what these sites often gloss over, stresses Berman. "People die from
this disease," she says. "They die."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Sharon," a pro-ana Webmaster, created her site as a refuge from
the rub of criticism, the prying questions about her weight and size.
Her pages are understated, almost elegant. She says she spends "too
many" hours a day tending to them, coordinating a full roster of
forums--from fasting and pills to women with families ("How do you
balance ana and family life?").</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-'90s, she says, she was 16, discovering the
Internet--and obsessed with thinness. "I put up my first page about
the beauty of starvation," she says, and mail piled in, both hateful
and kind. "I was quite proud of myself causing such a stir!"</TE>
<TE>   "But my interest in this has gone beyond being provocative," she
explains. "My original goal ... was to bring the issue of eating
disorders to the forefront by making a site that was 'borderline.'
Where do diets end and anorexia and bulimia begin?</TE>
<TE>   "I think the line is blurry," she says. "In women's mags you see
an article about the horrors of pro anorexia, or some ballet dancer
who died of an ED right next to ads for fad diets and bone-thin
models. I felt that I was receiving a mixed message from the world
around me, so I decided to send one right back."</TE>
<TE>   Experts don't disagree with "Sharon" about the conflicting signals
sent to women. "When I begin therapy," Maine says, "I tell patients,
'Our society is like living in a cult, and I'm going to have to
deprogram you.'"</TE>
<TE>   A wisp of an Olympic star or blade-thin runway model offered up as
symbols of success in one corner of the culture are likely to turn up
as well on sites like "Sharon's." Some pro-ana pages are festooned
with graphics of the Kate Mosses or Calista Flockharts of the moment,
scanned from fan or glamour magazines. Others might be interspersed
with anonymous photos of skeletal girls and women--miming the
provocative poses of their idols. Such images (as well as
affirmations, rules and revelations) are referred to as
"triggers"--inspiration to help extreme dieters stay the course.
"Hunger hurts, but starvation works!"</TE>
<TE>   Victoria Jackson understands the power of triggers. Now 20, the
University of North Carolina student has wrestled with anorexia since
9. "Being anorexic is really hard, and it takes a ton of self-control
and willpower," Jackson says. A message or picture on a Web site, she
suggests, "isn't strong enough to convince a mind to do something so
demanding. I really think that the decision is already made. But the
Web sites are like a morale booster, something to keep you going, to
make things easier."</TE>
<TE>   When she looks at the sites at a reporter's request, she remembers
the rush that used to accompany a new discovery, a new technique for
staying in control of her weight. "A drink that has no calories ...
[or] a ... new trick to stop hunger pains," she explains, felt like a
new chance. "You are going against what your body is telling you. If
you're really hungry, that's hard to fight, so new ways to make it
easier are embraced. It's just one more thing to be absorbed in. One
more thing to drive you, one more tool.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm past all of that," Jackson says, "but even looking at [a
site] really upsets me. It's really going to add to people's
problems."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While some patients are horrified by the sites and immediately
alert their therapists, others don't always let on that they've made
visits, says Maine, "but you figure it out." The sites "just
reinforce every pathological thought. Some sites tell what to wear.
How to mask your lag [in gaining weight]: Weights, shoes under your
arms. Eating olives and pickles, water loading. There's a science to
it."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, she adds, they provide fuel for denial. "A lot
of these patients will look at these sites and say: "Well, I've never
been that skinny!' or I've not been to the hospital three times. So
I'm not really an anorexic. That's just part of the whole web of
illogical thinking."</TE>
<TE>   Specialists such as Maine felt their patients pulling away as they
spent more time on the sites, but they were reluctant to lead public
battles to get pro-ana material off the Internet. "We were worried
we'd lead [patients] there," Maine says. So last year, before they
turned to the Internet service providers, Hoff and other specialists
tried contacting the Webmasters directly.</TE>
<TE>   "We made appeals about their own health and well-being," Hoff
says. "We reminded them about their potential for harm.
Unfortunately, we didn't have much luck. They felt that it was their
right. That people visit at their own risk. Many of them feel that
they are martyrs."</TE>
<TE>   They hang on, tenacious.</TE>
<TE>   So does Janice Saunders.</TE>
<TE>   After her success last summer, she was flamed with angry e-mail,
pelted with profanity, taunted and threatened. But there have been
sweet surprises.</TE>
<TE>   She played a particularly vigorous game of cat and mouse with an
angry Webmaster, whose site was shut down, then resurfaced and was
shut down again. It reappeared yet again, but this time, it had
changed.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you here for?" the site's most recent version now asked
visitors. "What do you hope to find?"</TE>
<TE>   What followed was a sober renunciation and apology that gave
Saunders pause. "I am now very grateful to Yahoo for removing my Web
site, twice. I was absolutely devastated and angry at the time, now I
am very grateful and fully supportive of them. Please reach out. You
don't have to be lonely or hurting anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Saunders was stunned, and revitalized. "I can't remove every Web
site," she says. "But I think if it changes one thing ... it's well
worth it. Because too often, I'll ask, 'Where's so and so?' They're
gone from the lists, the chat rooms. Sometimes there is no answer.
They don't know what happened. Some girls just disappear."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It certainly is good news that Los Angeles County has decided to
offer vocational classes, along with reading, writing and math, to
young inmates at the county's 19 juvenile camps.</LD>
<LD>   So 16-year-old Tim, who has been in and out of juvenile hall since
he was 13, is learning to repair computers. And 18-year-old Martel,
who's serving time for receiving stolen property, has been taught to
set up online networks. The hope is that the classes will steer
juvenile offenders toward more constructive pursuits.</LD>
<LD>   I'm all for anything that helps these kids become productive
citizens. But what about the young men and women who have managed to
stay on the right side of the law? What are we doing for 15-year-old
Tony, who's sitting in class at your local high school, marking time
until he gets his diploma, unprepared to do much more after
graduation than stumble through life at minimum wage?</LD>
<TE>   College isn't in the cards. He's not interested in another few
years of literature and algebra, even if he could qualify. He's a
good kid--hard-working, honest, reliable--but prospects are bleak for
a young man whose resume lists little more than passing grades and a
few years behind a McDonald's counter.</TE>
<TE>   I'll bet Tony would love to learn to fix a computer or repair a
car. Does he have to rob someone before we give him a chance?</TE>
<TE>   Ageneration ago, kids like Tony would have passed through a series
of vocational classes en route to graduation. Auto shop, drafting,
cooking, woodworking ... classes that might ignite in them a hidden
passion, or at least prepare them to leave school with the
fundamentals of a trade.</TE>
<TE>   Those classes are disappearing from our schools today, the victim
of encroaching technology and a disdain for anything that doesn't
square with our focus on higher test scores and college-for-all.</TE>
<TE>   Once the domain of students not considered college material, shop
classes prepared kids to earn a living. Well, those kids are still
with us, never mind the hoopla about every child going on to college.
The reality is not every student can, or should. But everyone needs
to be prepared to support himself or herself--and a family--some day.</TE>
<TE>   County probation officials recognize a simple truth: Kids who are
allowed to develop and pursue their own interests are more apt to
stay in school, and more prepared for life after graduation. We seem
to have lost sight of that in our push to keep all students moving in
lock-step along the most demanding academic tracks.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not advocating a return to the voc ed system of the past. Too
often, students were herded into shop classes by ethnicity or income
level. Kids who were black or brown or poor were taught a trade
instead of how to think, denied a chance to strengthen their
academics, discouraged from pursuing college degrees. Even today,
some shop teachers complain that their classes wind up as dumping
grounds for the unmotivated, the behavior problems, the class clowns.</TE>
<TE>   But the realities of family, economics and business dictate that
we find some way to match the interests and abilities of students
with the needs of society. Businesses are crying about the lack of
trained employees, craftsmen and women are in short supply and
society is becoming more economically stratified. Without either a
skill or a college education, even high school graduates will be
consigned to jobs that pay less than a living wage.</TE>
<TE>   "A college education is wonderful," says Assemblywoman Jackie
Goldberg, a former school board member in Los Angeles and one of
several state legislators sponsoring legislation to rebuild our
crumbling vocational ed system. But only about 20% of jobs today
require four years of college, and only one in four high school
students will wind up with a college degree. "Let's face it, you
still need tool and die makers, carpenters, plumbers, people to fix
the car, people who can run a commercial kitchen. The private sector
is screaming that they don't have anybody to hire, but what are we
doing to prepare kids for those jobs?"</TE>
<TE>   In the past 20 years, vocational offerings in California schools
have declined by more than 75%. For example, more than half the
state's high school auto shop programs have shut down, even though
26% of the state's automotive mechanics are expected to retire in the
next four years.</TE>
<TE>   Academic reforms that raised the bar in subjects like math,
English and science took money away from vocational programs.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think schools wanted to get rid of the classes, but they
couldn't afford them anymore," Goldberg said. It's hard to teach
subjects like drafting or auto shop without investing in expensive
equipment. "It's not the same old 'change the oil' mentality, not
just drafting tables and T squares. If we're going to train these
kids, we have to teach them on the kind of equipment they'll be
expected to use. That takes money and commitment."</TE>
<TE>   There are some bright spots on the comeback trail. Partnerships
with businesses have produced funding for innovative programs in
vocations such as drafting and culinary arts at a handful of schools.
Community colleges and adult education centers have opened their
classes to high school students. And the new focus on academics has
infused some vocational programs with a holistic kind of vitality.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a growing political will to push for more
vocational programs," Goldberg said. "We're seeing the hue and cry
come from everywhere--businesses, parents, educators. The pendulum
swung too far in the other direction."</TE>
<TE>   As it swings back, let's hope kids like Tony can grab a ride.</TE>

<DH>A word to men in mortal fear of women's cruel scrutiny:
Kitchen appliances and bizarre tchotchkes from nice guys are always
treasured over roses and rings from slime balls. But do not forget
the words of Shakespeare: 'Love looks not with the eyes, but with the
mind.' Don't just grab the first thing you see. Follow your heart,

<LD>Cupid's arrow is not the only good intention to frequently miss its
target. Men and Valentine's Day, as many women will testify, go
together like Dracula and sunlight, like the Hindenburg and hydrogen,
like soup and hair.... Who knows what lurks in the hearts of
gift-giving men? Something mysterious, something dark, something ...
challenged.</LD>
<LD>   Many a man seems to have taken to heart the kind of advice posted
on the Internet by one Don Jones. In his "A Guy's Guide to the
Perfect Valentine Gift," he says: "Buying a present does not have to
consist of any actual thought. The process only has to appear as
though some thought went into it." Guys, we are not duped.
Girlfriends, here is your testimony:</LD>

<TE>   It was big, it was flat. It was our first Valentine's Day
together. He is a professional artist. [Perhaps] a huge homemade
card, full of hearts and glitter? No, a doormat. With the comment: "I
noticed you needed one."</TE>

<TE>   I received a Chinese puzzle box with something inside, but you had
to be able to open the box to get the gift. That took around an hour
or so. The size of the box sort of led me to believe that it might
hold a ring-sized object. The gift was, in fact, a wire animal made
of paper clips and rubber bands. We got a divorce.</TE>

<TE>   One year, my usually romantic gift-giving husband gave me ...
poultry scissors. He demonstrated how not only did these scissors
quickly and mercilessly dismember a chicken, but they also had a
bottle opener on one end and, if turned inside out, became pliers.</TE>
<TE>   I've never cut a whole chicken into pieces, let alone cleaned one
out. Anyway, we got a "whole fryer" and I started to snap off the
legs and wings with the mighty scissors, and pull out the innards
with the "pliers" tool, and within 10 minutes I had to breathe into a
paper bag. I was gagging, sweating and trying to blame it on the flu
so as not to hurt my hubby's feelings. The fancy scissors have never
touched chicken flesh since, and are now only used for cutting the
price tags off new clothes.</TE>

... an actual pear!</TE>

<TE>   A husband, who had been married to and/or dating me for nearly 10
years, gave me earrings. Pierced. Didn't know I didn't have holes in
my ears.</TE>

<TE>   I received a lovely bouquet--on Feb. 15. When I called to thank
him, I asked: "Did the florist forget to deliver them yesterday?" He
said proudly, "No, I got them cheaper this way!" But it wasn't until
I realized that all the restaurants we went to had coupons in the
Entertainment Book (buy one meal, get one free) that I ended it.</TE>

<TE>   I got a waffle iron for Valentine's Day one year. I think it's
important to note that the waffle iron lasted much longer than the
relationship with the guy who gave it to me. It still makes great
waffles!</TE>
<TE>   Barbra, 30</TE>
<TE>   Last year I had just started dating this guy in January and I made
him beautiful chocolate truffles--I had never made them before and my
kitchen looked like it had been hit by a chocolate bomb. And he got
me ... nothing, because his male friends advised him it was too
early, and he ignored the wiser advice of his female friends.</TE>

<HD>The Day the Dragon Danced</HD>
<DH>Part 2 The story so far: Grandma doesn't want to go to the
New Year's Parade but Charles, her grandson, is pulling her along
anyway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAY HAUGAARD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"And when did New Year's Day start being in February?" Grandma
grumbled.</LD>
<LD>   "It's in February because the Chinese have a different calendar,
Grandma. It's called a lunar calendar. That means it's figured by the
moon." I felt so smart to remember all the stuff we learned in
school.</LD>
<LD>   "Well, that's really something--you teaching me, honey."</LD>
<TE>   "Can, you remember what color Daddy's shoes are, Grandma?" I
pulled on her hand.</TE>
<TE>   "How you expect me to remember what color your daddy's shoes are,
child? You're the smart little kid. You should be better at
remembering things than I am."</TE>
<TE>   But suddenly I remembered something else Miss Peng had told us.</TE>
<TE>   "Chinese dragons can fly through the air without even any wings.
Did you know that, Grandma?"</TE>
<TE>   "Your teacher said that too?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes."</TE>
<TE>   There was a clanging sound. Metal hitting metal. "Sounds like the
parade is starting!" I looked down the street. There were high school
kids beating drums in time to clanging cymbals. They moved their feet
up and down as if they were marching but didn't move.</TE>
<TE>   "See, the drums beat the rhythm for the dragon to dance to,
Grandma. He welcomes in the first day of the new year."</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to dance? Well, I never saw a dragon dance."</TE>
<TE>   Now things started coming. A man driving a red convertible went
by. He waved to everyone and threw candy money wrapped in bright gold
foil. The red streamers on his car fluttered. There were Chinese
words on them.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what that says, Grandma?"</TE>
<TE>   "I surely do not but let me guess. Could it say, 'Happy New
Year?'"</TE>
<TE>   "That's right. In Chinese you say, 'Gung hay fat choy.'"</TE>
<TE>   "Miss Peng told you that?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, Daddy did. When is the dragon coming?"</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly there was a loud snapping, popping and a craaak!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: What is making that noise? It isn't the Fourth of July!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Author's note: The Chinese New Year is based on a lunar (moon)
calendar. Each moon cycle is a month. The years are divided into
cycles of 12. Each of the 12 years is named after an animal: rat, ox,
tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, cock, dog and pig.
Today starts the year of the horse.</TE>

<TE>   Kay Haugaard loves Chinese dragons. Their bright colors and
dancing make her happy. This story will be on The Times' Web site at

<LD>This morning, as the sun rises to meet the East Coast morning TV
shows, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences unveils its
2001 Oscar nominees. Fine, great, swell. Americans should realize
that this annual announcement of cinematic congratulations is a
blatant attempt to steal the predawn spotlight from the Clem, our
fictitious award with a meaningless name presented for doubtful
achievements in numerous convenient categories.</LD>
<LD>   The Clems, long awaited by fans of superficial news that matters
least but gets read most, honor people from entertainment, politics
and sports. Dave Manning, the famous fictitious critic of the
Ridgefield (Conn.) Press, raves: "The Clem ... a stunning achievement
in commentary!"</LD>
<LD>   * Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan was a Clem finalist for
Best Animated Feature but lost to Yosemite Sam.</LD>
<TE>   * Gov. Gray Davis won a Clem for his tiptoeing State of the State
tax statement: "Fifth," he said in the 102nd paragraph, "I will not
advocate raising taxes." "Advocate" is such a careful verb, leaving
ample room for other tax actions. And three crucial words were
obviously missing; their presence would have etched the sentence in
public concrete. Davis did not say, "Read my lips, I will not
advocate raising taxes." The Clem for Parser of the Year.</TE>
<TE>   * The Clem Award for Best Actress was a tie--Sen. Hillary Rodham
Clinton and First Lady Laura Bush--for their smiles when meeting at a
Senate hearing.</TE>
<TE>   * A Clem for grubbing went to the Salt Lake City Olympics for
scalping its own tickets. NBC got Dishonorable Mention for tape-
delaying the Games because the West Coast couldn't handle such
excitement live.</TE>
<TE>   * The Clem for Unwarranted Optimism goes to whoever is president
of Argentina today.</TE>
<TE>   * The Clem Silver Smile goes to Kings forward Jason Allison, who
never does.</TE>
<TE>   *  The Clem Not a Chance Comeback Award was to go to a simple
shoemaker named Michael Jordan. But the statuette was revoked after
his 51-point NBA game. The award instead goes to a congressman named
Condit.</TE>
<TE>   * Queen Elizabeth II won the Gold Chapeau Clem for Most Hats Worn
in a 50-Year Reign.</TE>
<TE>   * Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill won for Finding Good News in
History's Largest Bankruptcy: "Part of the genius of capitalism is
people get to make good decisions or bad decisions. And they get to
pay the consequences or to enjoy the fruits of their decisions."</TE>
<TE>   * Democratic National Chairman Terry McAuliffe got the Clem for
Sincerest Mock Dismay after scoring large profits on shares of
another bankruptcy, Global Crossing Ltd.: "I feel bad for everybody
who lost money on Global Crossing."</TE>
<TE>   * Finally, the Clem Career Corrigan Award goes to the navigation
team aboard the Greenville, the nuclear sub that in three separate
incidents has run aground and collided with two different ships in
ocean waters covering 80% of the globe's surface.</TE>

<HD>Egypt's Blanket on Dissent</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a quarter of a century Saad Eddin Ibrahim has been a lonely voice
in Egypt, promoting democratic ideas and religious freedom while
incurring the wrath of officials. Two years ago authorities arrested
him and charged him with receiving illegal funds from the European
Commission to monitor elections and with defaming Egypt in human
rights reports. His real "crime" was criticizing the government.</LD>
<LD>   After a six-month trial that included thousands of pages of
evidence, a high court judge took little more than an hour to
pronounce Ibrahim guilty and sentence him to seven years at hard
labor. Last week a Cairo appeals court overturned the conviction.
Diplomats from the United States and several European countries
attended the appeals court hearing, signaling clearly that their
nations expect Egypt to live up to its rhetoric about moving toward
democracy.</LD>
<TE>   Egypt too often equates legitimate dissent with potential violence
and clamps down when it should offer more opportunities for peaceful
opposition. The lack of legitimate outlets for dissent makes it
easier for extremists to recruit followers. Organizations like Al
Qaeda, whose followers include a number of Egyptians, fester under
repression. (Osama bin Laden's right-hand man, Ayman Zawahiri, who is
thought to have played a part in the 1981 assassination of Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat, is Egyptian, as was Sept. 11 hijacker Mohamed
Atta.)</TE>
<TE>   Granting people greater opportunities to take part in civil
society undercuts complaints that they are not represented and that
the state serves only a corrupt elite. Ibrahim and those who worked
with him at his Ibn Khaldoun Center for Social Development Studies
pointed out irregularities in Egypt's elections that favored the New
Democratic Party of President Hosni Mubarak. They also drew
attention to violations of human rights in Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals panel gave no reason for its decision and ordered
Ibrahim, who holds Egyptian and American citizenship, freed to await
further proceedings. The government should call off its vendetta and
drop the charges. Western nations provide Egypt with billions of
dollars a year in aid and count on it to participate in the Middle
East peace process. The government should respond by recognizing that
dissent is not treason and that as a society becomes more open it
becomes stronger.</TE>

<HD>A Rein on Power Generators</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One reason for last year's electricity blackouts was that a number of
the state's electric power plants were down at one time for supposed
maintenance or repairs. But state officials believe that the plants
often were taken off line for phantom repairs to create a false
shortage to drive up prices.</LD>
<LD>   The state was helpless to do anything about it because the 1996
electricity deregulation law required utilities to sell many of their
power plants to independent generating companies and removed those
plants from the jurisdiction of the state Public Utilities
Commission. When PUC officials went to inspect the plants to see
whether they really were closed for repairs or maintenance, they were
usually denied access. That raises the question of whether there ever
was a shortage of power plant capacity. Once the power companies
finally got all the plants up and running, there was plenty of power
and no more blackouts and prices began to fall.</LD>
<LD>   Ultimately, the Independent System Operator, an independent body
created by the Legislature to broker the purchase and sale of power,
estimated that big generating companies that own power plants in
California overcharged the state by as much as $6 billion, in large
part by creating false shortages and driving up the price to
stratospheric levels.</LD>
<TE>   The Legislature must make sure that the state is never again in a
position to be manipulated by the power companies. It should quickly
pass SB 39xx, by Sen. Jackie Speier, a Hillsborough Democrat. (A
double x designates a bill introduced in a second special session.)
The measure has passed the Senate but has been held up in the
Assembly since last fall, largely because of a personal squabble that
had little or nothing to do with the merits of the bill.</TE>
<TE>   SB 39xx is simple and logical. It would allow the PUC to require
that plants run by companies such as Calpine and Duke Energy be
operated in a way that ensures their "availability to maintain the
reliability of the electric supply system," as it does for those
plants still run by the major utilities, including Southern
California Edison.</TE>
<TE>   The measure would not place generating companies under state
control for rates and power contracts. That authority would remain
with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Legislature
already has passed a companion bill, AB 28xx, by Assemblywoman Carole
Migden (D-San Francisco), to provide standards for scheduling
maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   The power shortage may be fading from the state's collective
memory but much of the tangled mess of the deregulation law remains
to be dealt with. It's time for the Assembly to approve SB 39xx and
send it to Gov. Gray Davis for his signature.</TE>

<HD>Does Spending Account for Lifestyle Difference?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Southern Californians Buy Into the Lifestyle" (Feb. 6) uses the
Consumer Expenditure Survey to show how the Southern California
lifestyle differs from that of the rest of the country. Some of the
data seem to show something real; some don't.</LD>
<LD>   The difference between annual expenditures for tobacco probably
shows a lifestyle difference: L.A.'s $204 is just two-thirds of the
U.S.'s $309. It's reasonable to assume that cigarettes in California
are not significantly cheaper than elsewhere, so Angelenos probably
smoke fewer packs per day.</LD>
<LD>   The difference between annual housing expenditures for L.A.,
$16,550, and the U.S. as a whole, $12,188, may be significant; L.A.
spends about one-third more. But housing in the U.S. overall is
substantially less costly per square foot than housing in Southern
California, so does the difference show anything about lifestyle?</LD>
<TE>   Other figures probably show nothing at all. For example: "Southern
California households spend $148 on books, compared with $153
nationally." To attribute that tiny difference to anything at all is
unsupportable. Similarly, the difference between a transportation
expenditure of $7,215 nationally and $7,701 in Southern California is
less than 7%, reflecting not lifestyle but slightly higher gas
prices.</TE>
<TE>   The wonderful Southern California lifestyle is actually based on
our extraordinary environment and the creativity of the people who
live here. These things cannot be bought.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Bradley</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What about a regional comparison on how much fatter people are now
compared to 30 years ago? Or maybe an international comparison so
that Americans might start seeing how they really look through
others' eyes. In spite of how much time Southern Californians spend
at the gym, they don't seem to be losing any weight. At least the
statistic showing lower alcohol consumption is one we can be proud
of.</TE>
<TE>   Looking good because we're in good health is the real issue here,
not how much we spend on clothes and cars.</TE>

<LD>Re "Redone Park No Longer a Home," Feb. 8: I applaud Riverside's
efforts to restore White Park and beautify it. "Today," your writer
says, "the 112-year-old park practically shines." Wonderful. The
article said that the city is planning to spend $27 million in
improvements to other parks over the next few years.</LD>
<LD>   I have another suggestion: Use the $27 million to build homeless
shelters, and Riverside will not have a homeless problem. The
homeless people then can be put to work beautifying the other parks.
The homeless problem, having been eliminated by the building of $27
million worth of housing, would cease to put the kinds of stress on
the parks that outdoor living generates. The homeless men and women
would be housed and off to a good start contributing to society.</LD>
<LD>   To simply spend the $27 million on improving the parks without
addressing the social problems that helped cause the decline of the
parks and surrounding neighborhoods is foolish and shortsighted. A
civilized society is judged not in how it coddles and protects the
strong but in how it helps and cares for the weak.</LD>

<LD>The killing of pigs on Santa Cruz and Catalina Islands is an
admission of failure to properly manage California wildlife ("U.S. to
Aid Island's War on Wild Pigs," Feb. 6). For a national park official
to be "jumping up and down on this one"--the wholesale slaughter of
thousands of animals--is deplorable. Once the island foxes recover
and overpopulate, they too will be shot, when the only solution is
death.</LD>

<LD>Re "In a Pageant of Pomp, Pride and Security, Salt Lake Games Open,"
Feb. 9: I knew there was something about Friday night that I loved:
No Hollywood. It was wholesome--nothing outrageous. I loved the
Indians and the pioneers and especially the children. My
great-grandfather was there when the trains connected and he helped
drive in the golden spike.</LD>
<LD>   Salt Lake City can be very proud of its production. There must
have been a lot of tears when the flag was carried into the stadium.
I was glued to my chair and was not bored or "shocked" once. Our
President Bush is a class act; he fit in perfectly. God bless all
those in service to our country, those who lost their lives and those
they left behind. Thank you, Salt Lake City.</LD>

<LD>"Chief: Walk Away Proud" (editorial, Feb. 10) ignored an important
point. Charter Amendment F, passed in 1992 by a large majority of the
voters, set in place a system of determining who should be the leader
of the LAPD without regard to the opinions of the mayor, The Times or
Rep. Maxine Waters. The decision regarding Bernard Parks' request for
an additional term as chief of the LAPD should properly be made by
the Police Commission, based upon objective criteria related to his
performance as viewed against the rating criteria set by the
commission.</LD>

<TE>   I was prepared to believe this was all about Parks' job
performance until I read your editorial. You state, "The union's
leadership has attacked Parks with an unseemly zeal that even tops
the fervor with which it went after the previous police chief, Willie
L. Williams. While Williams and Parks could not be more different,
they are both African Americans." I forgot all about Chief Williams.
This sounds like a clear case of racism. How did the union feel about
Daryl Gates? Yeah, that's what I thought.</TE>

<LD>Re "U.S. Forces Beat Afghans After Deadly Assault, Ex-Prisoners Say,"
Feb. 11: American forces held prisoners for 16 days and beat and
kicked them until they realized that they were not Taliban or Al
Qaeda fighters. (I suppose the violence would have been justified if
they were terrorists?) So, the Americans apologize, and that's that.
Are the U.S. soldiers involved in these cruel beatings going to be
held accountable and disciplined? Probably not. This will be
dismissed with a big "Oops!" and forgotten.</LD>

to show the world that we are not on a peaceful mission but one of
revenge, power and arrogance.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Judith Chirlin overturned the
result of the Compton mayoral race last week and declared former
Mayor Omar Bradley the winner of the election, she did more than add
another twist to the dramatic and unpredictable politics of the city
of Compton. She elevated social science over the democratic process
in a way that is dangerous and unprecedented.</LD>
<LD>   Many will recall the allegations after the 2000 election that the
so-called butterfly ballot used in Florida's Palm Beach County led a
number of people who intended to vote for Al Gore to vote instead for
Pat Buchanan. Buchanan received a statistically high number of votes
compared to how he did elsewhere, which most social scientists say
would not have happened by chance.</LD>
<LD>   One proposed remedy to the butterfly ballot issue was to hold a
new election in Palm Beach County, but a judge ruled that the
Constitution requires all votes for the U.S. president be held on the
same day. Others suggested "reallocating" the vote based on
statistical studies showing that most of those Buchanan votes
"belonged" to Gore.</LD>
<TE>   This remedy, however, would have been unprecedented and would have
allocated votes based, at best, on a social science guess.</TE>
<TE>   Yet that is basically what the judge has done in the Compton case.</TE>
<TE>   She ruled that the name of Bradley's opponent, Eric Perrodin,
illegally appeared first on the ballot and that Bradley did not give
up his right to raise this issue by failing to call it to the
attention of the city clerk before the election.</TE>
<TE>   Both of these points are debatable.</TE>
<TE>   State law on ballot order is subject to two interpretations, and
Bradley's election attorneys should have checked whether the ballot
complied with state law. These arguments provide good grounds for
Perrodin to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   But even accepting the judge's rulings on these points, the remedy
is unsupportable.</TE>
<TE>   The judge accepted the testimony of Jon Krosnick, an Ohio State
University political science professor, that ballots are subject to a
"primacy effect."</TE>
<TE>   Krosnick is no doubt right that those candidates who are placed
first on the ballot tend to gain votes because of that placement.
Whether it stems from voter laziness or some other factor, this
advantage is so well known that California, like other states,
requires use of a "randomized" alphabet for listing candidate names
on the ballot in each election.</TE>
<TE>   Krosnick testified that in his estimation Perrodin received an
extra 300 or so votes because of his placement first on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The judge took this educated guess by Krosnick--based on a study
of Franklin County, Ohio, a place very different from Compton--which
certainly has a significant margin of error, and she elevated it over
the democratic process.</TE>
<TE>   She viewed the testimony as if it established how people actually
voted, and she used that testimony to put Bradley back in office.</TE>
<TE>   No published cases of which I am aware establishes this remedy.
Judges tend to overturn elections and install a different candidate
only when the judge can identify a certain number of illegal votes
cast and that affected the outcome of the election.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, the number of illegal votes identified was smaller
than the margin of difference between the two candidates.</TE>
<TE>   There is no question that social scientists have established a
"primacy effect." But social science is not an exact science.</TE>
<TE>   A judge should not credit an educated guess over the right of the
people of Compton to choose their own leaders. If the judge believed
the results were in doubt because of Krosnick's testimony, a new
election would have been the proper remedy.</TE>

election law, advised the city of Compton in the election dispute.</TE>

<HD>Slobodan Milosevic Is the Scapegoat in a Show Trial</HD>

<LD>The Balkans is a strange place: Nothing is what it seems to be.</LD>
<LD>   In June 2001, after nearly a decade of bloodshed and related media
frenzy, Slobodan Milosevic was arrested and transferred to The Hague
for trial. Thus ended the public relations phase of the hunt, giving
way to indictments for war crimes in Kosovo, Croatia and
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Milosevic, as a scapegoat in a show trial with a
predestined outcome, would be a perfect medium to exorcise the guilt
of those who are trying to obliterate their complicity in provoking
and expanding the Balkan wars.</LD>
<LD>   It will be voodoo justice: a desperate and dishonest attempt to
close the 1990s chapter of the Balkan history. Milosevic is gone from
the Balkan stage, but his departure gives additional credence to some
inconvenient facts.</LD>
<TE>   The careful reading of the last 10 years suggests that the trial
will be Milosevic's final act, designed, timed and scripted by higher
powers to neatly wrap up the cautionary tale of the "butcher of the
Balkans." Former Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck wrote in
a 2001 article in the Boston Globe that, if the 1995 Dayton agreement
"prolonged Milosevic's rule ... it also sealed his fate." In it,
Milosevic agreed to the tribunal that is now putting him on trial.
When he was arrested in 2001, "the trap that had been set in 1995 at
last slammed shut," wrote Shattuck. This confirmed a long-held
suspicion that the U.S. manipulated Milosevic and world opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Were allegations of Milosevic's "war crimes" in Bosnia and Croatia
true, he would have been indicted in 1995, instead of rubbing elbows
with U.S. politicos at the Dayton peace talks. Were Washington
serious about toppling him, it could have done so in 1996 by
supporting the Serb opposition movement, Zajedno. Yet the U.S. seems
to have been more interested in keeping Milosevic in power until the
last part of the Pax Americana scenario in the Balkans played out
with the NATO occupation of Kosovo.</TE>
<TE>   As the Balkans boogeyman on whom anything could be blamed,
Milosevic was an invaluable public relations asset to NATO
politicians who have been conveniently advancing their own
geopolitical agenda in the region in tandem with Albanian
secessionists.</TE>
<TE>   The individual charges against Milosevic are a double-edged sword:
Every one of them could be applied to the wartime deeds of Croats and
Bosnian Muslims, with regard to the Serbs and each other in a string
of nasty three-way armed conflicts. From the overblown issues of
"rape camps" to "concentration camps" to the true culprits in market
bombings to provocations and setups in Srebrenica to Racak, the long
list of myths conflicting with facts may prove to be embarrassing.</TE>
<TE>   The current war on terrorism brought to the limelight the ties
between the Bosnian war effort and Osama bin Laden's network. The
issue of simultaneous support from the CIA and Al Qaeda for the
Kosovo Liberation Army in the 1990s will gain attention as well.</TE>
<TE>   As someone who has nothing to lose, Milosevic may well take the
stand and turn the tables on his accusers. It may be only a matter of
time before someone cries out that the emperor is naked.</TE>

<HD>Enron Flew Under the Radar</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is the Enron story one of outrageous mendacity or stupefying
ignorance?</LD>
<LD>   As the case unfolds, corporate whistle-blowers emerge to tell of
timely but unheeded warnings of accounting chicanery while the
company's top executives, some now richly retired and others holding
high positions in the Bush administration, assume the posture of the
three monkeys of evil innocence. Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no
evil.</LD>
<LD>   Top Enron executives either were unbelievably stupid or their
business practices were deliberately venal to the point of
criminality.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, that determination will be left to the courts, but what
we have learned so far provides a compelling refutation of the
central ideology of modern conservatism, that huge corporations
function best when freed of governmental oversight.</TE>
<TE>   How opaque and out of control these enterprises must be if those
who run them profess such ignorance!</TE>
<TE>   Since the election of Ronald Reagan, the apostles of an
unregulated market, lavishly financed by business lobbyists, have
demolished barriers to corporate greed and corruption that for most
of a century had served this country well.</TE>
<TE>   The Enron debacle is just the most damning in a long list of
evidence that the zealots of deregulation did this country, and its
free-enterprise system, a terrible disservice. The financial markets
are now roiled and may be permanently damaged by profound suspicion
of corporate practices on the part of investors, who now realize they
have good reason to fear the worst.</TE>
<TE>   The deregulation ideology of modern conservatism, endorsed
mightily by our current president, who cited Enron as a model, holds
that big business can best police itself and that government
regulation is a costly intrusion.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the best case made by Enron's top executives to explain the
ignominious crash of their enterprise is that it was not possible for
them to know what was going on.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, if the bosses could not get at the truth, then outside
public surveillance, beyond that of complicit accounting firms, is
required.</TE>
<TE>   What better poster child for the failure of corporate
self-policing then Enron director Wendy L. Gramm, wife of Texas Sen.
Phil Gramm, who came to that $300,000-a-year position immediately
upon leaving her post in the first Bush administration as chair of
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Commodities trading has been Enron's most lucrative business. Its
enormous profits were made possible by two decisions pushed through
the commission by Gramm in the last months of the Bush administration
that exempted Enron's derivative trading from CFTC fraud oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Authority for the CFTC to exempt Enron was provided by a law
signed in 1992 by President George Bush, a close friend of Enron
Chairman Kenneth L. Lay and a major recipient of Enron campaign
contributions. Glenn English, the former Democratic representative
from Oklahoma who was one of the sponsors of the original act, warned
that the law's purpose was subverted by Gramm's rulings, which he
predicted accurately "opened the door to serious fraud," calling it
"the most irresponsible decision" that he had come across in his 18
years in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   While serving on the Enron board, Wendy Gramm has been a leading
voice in Washington, testifying before congressional committees in
favor of across-the-board deregulation of corporate business. Her
directorship of the regulatory studies program at George Mason
University, which received a $50,000 gift from Enron, has added
academic credibility to her testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Wendy Gramm served as a member of the Enron board's auditors
committee that had particular responsibility for making sure that the
books were not cooked. That they were cooked and that she, an
experienced professional in such matters, now claims ignorance of the
company's nefarious accounting practices, makes a compelling argument
for government surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   Enron spells the end of the Reagan revolution, which aimed at
giving corporate America a blank check.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, we have been mesmerized by woeful anecdotes of
government meddling in the private sector, but now as the Enron
scandal unfolds, there's a growing bipartisan consensus for Congress
to do its constitutionally mandated job of regulating the flow of
interstate commerce in the public interest.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, as Enron demonstrates, corporate greed knows no limits.</TE>

<LD>Re ''Bush Blesses Charity Plan,'' Feb. 8: President Bush's
Faith-Based Initiative is now renamed the Armies of Compassion
Initiative? What a fine (and amazingly candid) improvement. In order
to downplay the theocratic underpinnings of the earlier title, the
initiative now has a name that conjures images of soldiers shooting
mutilated battlefield victims, charitably putting them out of their
misery. Who said irony is dead?</LD>

<HD>Gore a Loser? Look at the Votes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Al Who? Gore's Uphill Road," Opinion, Feb. 10: So Jack Germond
wonders if Al Gore has the political standing to take part in the
"national debate." Hmm. He served two terms as our vice president and
got more votes for president in 2000 than any Democratic candidate
ever. In fact, some might say he actually won the election.</LD>
<LD>   Gore never had a chance to show what he could do as president, but
there is something we know for sure: Gore wouldn't have torn the
Constitution into pieces to benefit big business or the Christian
Coalition. He wouldn't have shredded international treaties and made
everyone's backyard a potential site for an oil rig. And he certainly
wouldn't have presented Congress with a budget that ravages our
Social Security surplus in the name of an "all war, all the time"
agenda.</LD>
<LD>   Those who voted for Gore should do so again and finally make their
votes count. To do otherwise is validating the idea that elections
can be won by destroying the opposition rather than by using good
ideas to get votes.</LD>
<TE>   Jody Kepple</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am mystified by a drawing you featured on the front page of the
Opinion section. Gore is shown in caricature with the word "loser"
stamped upon his forehead.</TE>
<TE>   Gore received the second-highest total of votes for
president--ever. Had the national media done their job in exposing
the corrupt manipulation of the Florida vote, he might be president
today.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps imprinting the word "robbed" upon Gore's forehead would be
more accurate.</TE>
<TE>   David M. Evans</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even with the Enron debacle fully upon us, Germond describes Ralph
Nader's presidential run as no more than a spoiler for Gore (along
with the Supreme Court's Florida vote decision) and as an ego trip.
Had Nader and the issue he saw as central to the campaign--corporate
control of politics--been allowed onto the podium of even one of the
three presidential debates, the Enron scandal might have been forced
onto center stage.</TE>
<TE>   If the major party candidates had been compelled to acknowledge
it, corporate corruption might have caught the voters' attention
before it turned out the lights in California, drove up utility bills
and cost investors and employees their life savings. Straight talk
about corporate contamination of politics was censored out of the
presidential campaign when Nader was locked out. Dumping Gore the
next time around will not change that.</TE>

<HD>Vote for Real Campaign Finance Reform</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This week the House will vote on campaign finance reform. Reps.
Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) and Martin Meehan (D-Mass.) have proposed
a bill that bans unlimited contributions from corporations like
Enron, labor unions and the wealthiest Americans.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of reform have offered an alternative to Shays-Meehan
that makes a bad system worse. Rep. Robert Ney's (R-Ohio) bill only
limits these so-called soft-money contributions in paltry ways and
then reroutes them through state parties, where they can be spent
without limitation.</LD>
<LD>   Other representatives argue that Shays-Meehan does not do
enough--that it has been weakened over the course of deliberation.
The Shays-Meehan bill is strong enough to stop corporate interests
from having coffee meetings in the White House and to stop
multimillionaires' overnight arrangements in the Lincoln Bedroom.
Shays-Meehan is neither weak nor insufficient.</LD>
<TE>   Now is the time tell Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) to
support real reform by voting for Shays-Meehan. Now is not the time
to abandon real reform by voting for the Ney red herring or to
sabotage reform by voting for "poison pill" amendments designed to
destroy the legislation.</TE>

<HD>V. Posner, 83; Tycoon and Corporate Raider</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>MIAMI -- Former corporate raider Victor Posner, who once owned
Arby's, Royal Crown Cola and Sharon Steel, died Monday of pneumonia
at the Miami Heart Institute. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Posner, a Miami Beach financier and industrialist, was a fearsome
corporate takeover artist in the 1960s, '70s and '80s whose empire
was once valued at $4 billion. He was named the nation's top-paid
chief executive by Business Week in 1985.</LD>
<LD>   But legal troubles befell Posner in 1987, when he pleaded no
contest to tax evasion and was ordered to give $3 million to the
homeless and serve meals in a Miami shelter.</LD>
<TE>   In 1994, a judge found Posner and his son, Steven, guilty of
violating federal securities law by failing to disclose a fraudulent
takeover scheme involving them and Wall Street investment tycoons
Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky.</TE>
<TE>   The judge barred the Posners from serving as officers or directors
of any publicly held company and ordered them to repay about $4
million they had received from Fischbach Corp., the New York
electrical company targeted in the scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Baltimore and the son of Russian emigres, Posner dropped
out of high school at 13 to work in a grocery store owned by his
parents. By 21, he had earned his first million dollars in Baltimore
real estate and continued building homes in Maryland until moving to
Miami Beach in 1954.</TE>
<TE>   Milton Ferrell, Posner's lawyer and friend, described the
businessman as "remarkably intelligent, very warm and engaging,
strong-willed."</TE>
<TE>   Posner continued his philanthropy despite his legal troubles. The
Victor Posner Center for Communicative Disorders at the University of
Miami Ear Institute is named in his honor.</TE>
<TE>   He also gave to Mount Sinai, Jackson and Miami Children's
hospitals in the Miami area.</TE>
<TE>   Posner's survivors include four children, seven grandchildren, one
brother and one sister.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral services will be private.</TE>

<HD>Tracy Roberts, 87; Acting Coach Led Playhouse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tracy Roberts, who acted in her youth but became better known as an
acting coach and artistic director of the Tracy Roberts Actors
Studio, where she produced and directed such plays as Ray Bradbury's
"The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit," has died. She was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Roberts died Friday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles,
said her sister, television writer and producer Ann Marcus. She died
of a cerebral hemorrhage.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to the Bradbury play, Roberts in recent years earned a
Drama-Logue Award for her production of "Shadowlands."</LD>
<TE>   Most recently, her sister said, Roberts directed "An Evening With
Clifford Odets" for an American Playwrights series, with a commentary
written and narrated by their brother, television and film writer
Raymond Goldstone.</TE>
<TE>   A decade ago, the two sisters collaborated on a play, "The Art of
Dining," which Roberts directed with Marcus as executive producer at
the Tracy Roberts Theatre in West Hollywood. Marcus, financially
successful as head writer for 14 years on "Knots Landing," among
other credits, had given Roberts a check for the production as a
birthday present.</TE>
<TE>   The careers as well as the lives of the sisters were long
intertwined. Roberts produced the first play Marcus wrote, "A Woman's
Place," at the Desilu Playhouse in 1960. Marcus got Roberts her first
television directing job.</TE>
<TE>   Born Blanche Goldstone in Little Falls, N.Y., which she liked to
describe as "pure Babbitt country," Roberts was the oldest of the
three showbiz siblings.</TE>
<TE>   With the goal of writing and acting, she studied at the University
of Michigan and Cornell University, and then moved to New York to
study and perform with the greats of the Actors Studio--Lee
Strasberg, Clifford Odets, Stella Adler, Elia Kazan.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, she also married Jerry Adelman, worked as a
model for illustrators and began searching for a stage name. She
settled on Tracy--sometimes credited as Tracey--Roberts in homage to
two actors she admired, Spencer Tracy and Robert Montgomery.</TE>
<TE>   The blue-eyed, raven-haired Roberts landed a role in Odets'
"Paradise Lost" and performed in several well-known plays, including
"The Women," "Hedda Gabler," "The Seagull" and the Broadway and Los
Angeles premieres of "Orpheus Descending."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, she also performed in such plays as "Winter Kill"
with Robert Alda.</TE>
<TE>   Motion pictures followed, and she appeared in several from
Westerns to comedies during the 1950s, including an uncredited role
as the "redhead" in Dean Martin's 1956 "Hollywood or Bust" and her
personal favorite, the 1952 "Actors and Sin" with Eddie Albert.</TE>
<TE>   But brains, beauty and talent were never enough to make her a
star.</TE>
<TE>   "As you get older, you can't get the parts. I hated all the B.S.
involved," she told The Times in 1993. "So when someone suggested I
start teaching acting, it first seemed like a comedown. But ... I was
inspired by other actors who had taken up teaching, like Bruce Dern
and Lee Grant [and by] ... my spiritual guide, my beloved acting
inspiration and teacher Michael Chekhov."</TE>
<TE>   She quickly established herself as a respected acting coach and
director and producer of plays featuring her students.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, after a quarter-century or so in the profession, she told
The Times she had indeed gone into teaching "kicking and screaming"
but had since "fallen in love" with the job.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything has to be there at once," she explained. "The painter
has paint, the sculptor clay, the musician an instrument. Actors have
only themselves: their imaginations, memories and attitudes--which
can be used in our craft."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts taught camera classes, audition and production workshops,
speech, movement, musical comedy and script analysis classes, but all
with the same focus, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We learn how to push buttons, tap into that creative energy, so
that those sources of behavior are there on demand. Then it's the
choice of those tools that gives an actor his individuality, his own
special talent."</TE>
<TE>   Known for her independence and intelligence, Roberts was perhaps
best described by her friend Anais Nin who dedicated one of her
books: "For T--Who is all the women I ever wrote about and not
according to men's patterns."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts is survived by her sister and brother. A memorial service
is being planned.</TE>

<HD>Nick Brignola, 65; Top Jazz Saxophone Player</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nick Brignola, a baritone saxophonist who was one of the top players
of his instrument in jazz, has died. He was 65.</LD>
<LD>   Brignola died Friday at the Albany Medical Center in Albany, N.Y.,
after a long battle with cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Troy, N.Y., Brignola was largely self-taught, learning the
clarinet at age 11 and then alto and tenor saxophones.</LD>
<TE>   Brignola studied music at Ithaca College and won a music
scholarship to the Berklee School of Music in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   He picked up the burly baritone saxophone quite by accident,
taking it as a loaner when his alto saxophone was being repaired.</TE>
<TE>   Influenced by greats of the baritone saxophone such as Harry
Carney, a mainstay of the great Duke Ellington orchestra, Brignola
developed his own style and began playing in Greenwich Village in New
York in the late 1950s. He next traveled to San Francisco, where he
worked with Cal Tjader's group.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, he became a prominent member of Woody Herman's big
band. He later began an association with trumpeter Ted Curson that
was to last off and on through the next three decades.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1960s, Brignola formed an electronic jazz-rock group
that opened for several rock acts, including Cat Stevens and Blood,
Sweat and Tears.</TE>
<TE>   But he returned to his jazz roots in the 1970s, teaming up again
with Curson and performing with him throughout the United States and
Europe into the 1980s. He also recorded a number of critically
well-received albums for small labels. When Brignola recently
appeared at the Jazz Bakery in Los Angeles, critic Don Heckman noted
that while he "has had an underappreciated career," he nevertheless
"played solo after solo filled with virtuosic explorations of the
horn."</TE>
<TE>   Brignola is survived by his wife, Yvonne; three children; a
granddaughter; and his mother.</TE>

<HD>Ani Pachen Dolma, 68; Tibet's 'Warrior Nun' and Author</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ani Pachen Dolma, known as Tibet's "warrior nun," who led the
resistance against the Chinese and was imprisoned for 21 years, has
died. She was 68. Dolma, who frequently brought her cause to Southern
California, died Feb. 2 of heart failure at her home in the Tibetan
exile community of Dharamsala, India.</LD>
<LD>   Her remarkable story was detailed in her book, "Sorrow Mountain:
The Journey of a Tibetan Warrior Nun," written with Adelaide Donnelly
and published in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   That summer, Dolma led one section of the San Francisco-to-San
Diego march to rally support for Tibetan independence from China. The
two groups met in Santa Monica to coincide with a visit here by the
Dalai Lama of Tibet, who wrote an introduction to Dolma's book. Actor
Richard Gere, a Buddhist and active supporter of the free-Tibet
movement, also wrote a preface and helped get the book in print.</LD>
<TE>   The Tibetan Government in Exile had asked the nun to write the
autobiography, and gave her stationery, overcoming her reluctance to
tell her story on the grounds that others had suffered more than she
had.</TE>
<TE>   She finally agreed to the project, she told an interviewer last
year, because: "Through my experiences, I can introduce to other
people what has happened to my country and also let the younger
generation know about what has happened to their country and what is
going on. Also, I thought, I am old, I am an old lady now, so after I
die I cannot bring my story with me. So I leave this story, and
through this story I am hoping will generate some sort of support in
the world to our cause."</TE>
<TE>   A reviewer for the Malaysia New Straits Times pronounced Dolma's
book "generally a good read," and wrote: "What is moving is the way
she successfully sought inner calm in the teachings of the Buddha,
despite the anger welling up inside her. There was no vengeance, only
remorse for the loss of the sacred scriptures and monasteries, which
were destroyed as part of a forced abandonment of Tibetan culture,
customs, habits and thoughts."</TE>
<TE>   A London Sunday Mail reviewer evaluated: "The writing is a little
slow to digest because it is set in a cultural milieu that is new to
Western readers. But the courageous Ani Pachen deserves the effort.
And her cause deserves to be recognized as a tragedy, not just a
slogan in the catalogue of human-rights abuses to which we in the
Western comfort zone turn a complacent cold shoulder."</TE>
<TE>   Born Pachen Dolma, the future freedom fighter was the only
surviving child of Pomda Gonor, chieftain of the Lemdha clan in Gonjo
in Kham, eastern Tibet. Although trained for marriage into another
chieftain's family, she also learned to ride horses and shoot guns
and became religiously devout. In her teens, she rebelled against
arranged marriage by fleeing to a monastery and becoming a Buddhist
nun--Ani Pachen. "Ani" means "nun" and "Pachen" translates roughly to
"Big Courage."</TE>
<TE>   But when her father died in 1958, clan elders insisted she take
over his duties, and she abandoned the religious life to lead farmers
and nomads in armed resistance to the invading Chinese People's
Liberation Army. When Gonjo was overrun, Dolma fled to the hills with
her family and led the fighting until she was captured a year later.</TE>
<TE>   For 21 years, until her release in January 1981, she endured cold,
starvation, psychologically scathing interrogation and physical
torture. She was kept in leg irons for a year, frequently hung upside
down, and for nine months confined to a dark concrete isolation cell.
She spent 11 years in the notorious Drapchi prison in the Tibetan
capital of Lhasa. Her hair fell out, and her health never recovered
from the years of malnourishment and mistreatment.</TE>
<TE>   "Faith. Faith kept me going," she said in an interview last year.</TE>
<TE>   Even after her release, she continued to fight for the cause of
independence in Tibet. But under threat of rearrest in 1988, she fled
over the snow-covered Himalayas to Nepal and then to Dharamsala,
where she realized her dream to meet the Dalai Lama and tell him her
story.</TE>
<TE>   Dolma made several trips to world capitals, including London and
Washington, D.C., to rally support for Tibetan independence,
frequently in the Dalai Lama's entourage.</TE>
<TE>   She left no immediate survivors.</TE>

<HD>Dave Van Ronk, 65; Folk Singer, Dylan Influence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Van Ronk, a singer and guitarist who sat in on the birth of the
1960s folk music revival and served as a mentor to its biggest star,
Bob Dylan, died Sunday in New York from colon cancer. He was 65.</LD>
<LD>   Though Van Ronk was never a major record-seller nor a prolific
songwriter, he was an influential interpreter of the country blues
tradition, and was among the first to record songs written by Dylan,
Joni Mitchell and other young composers who would soon make personal
expression a major component of popular music.</LD>
<LD>   Van Ronk had continued to tour and teach guitar until late last
year, when he underwent cancer surgery.</LD>
<TE>   Raised in his native Brooklyn and later in Queens, he began
playing the ukulele when he was 12 and later moved on to banjo and
guitar. A purist who favored traditional New Orleans jazz, he moved
to Manhattan in the mid-'50s and played banjo in jazz groups while
living in communal lofts and apartments with large groups of friends.</TE>
<TE>   Though he was an admitted "snob" with a disdain for folk music,
Van Ronk took a liking to the blues music he encountered while
collecting jazz records. To learn the finger-picking guitar technique
of such bluesmen as Furry Lewis, he watched the young musicians who
flocked to Washington Square to play folk music every weekend.</TE>
<TE>   His encounters there led to instruction from such masters as the
Rev. Gary Davis, but Van Ronk had no intention of being a
professional musician, planning instead to make his living in the
merchant marine. But when the singer Odetta heard him perform at the
Cafe Bizarre, she put him in touch with Albert Grossman, who later
would manage Dylan and others. Grossman at one point offered Van Ronk
a post in a folk trio he was assembling, but Van Ronk declined,
leaving it to someone else to fill out the lineup of Peter, Paul &amp;
Mary.</TE>
<TE>   But with his raspy voice and accomplished guitar work, Van Ronk
became prominent on the burgeoning folk scene, recording first for
the Folkways label and later for Prestige. He also was a resource for
younger musicians, including Dylan, who had come to New York from
Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Dylan frequently stayed at Van Ronk's apartment, where the two
shared ideas about music and literature. Van Ronk is credited with
introducing Dylan to the French Symbolist poets, and the two recorded
many of the same vintage songs, such as "Fixin' to Die" and "See That
My Grave Is Kept Clean." The version of "House of the Rising Sun" on
Dylan's debut album is based on Van Ronk's arrangement. They drifted
apart, but in 1974 they were together again, with Van Ronk joining
Dylan on stage at a New York benefit concert for Chilean political
prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Van Ronk's eclectic career continued into the 1990s. He performed
music ranging from jug band (including an album of Prokofiev's "Peter
and the Wolf" in jug-band style) to folk-rock to Brecht-Weill. His
1995 album "From ... Another Time &amp; Place" was nominated for a Grammy
in the folk category. He received a Lifetime Achievement Award from
ASCAP in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Van Ronk is survived by his wife, Andrea Vuocolo.</TE>

<HD>Donor Withdraws Gift to Trinity Law School Parent</HD>
<DH>Philanthropy: Trust pulls endowment worth an estimated $7
million yearly. Catalyst was firing of school's dean.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. REZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The head of an Orange County-based trust has withdrawn an offer of a
gift worth millions of dollars to the private university that owns
Trinity Law School in Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   William Welty, trustee of the Joshua Davidson Charitable Remainder
Annuity Trust in Yorba Linda, said the trust had planned to give
Trinity International University about $7 million annually so its
divinity school could be tuition-free. The money was to come from
income generated by one video and 16 audio satellite channels
controlled by the trust. The channels were appraised at $258 million
in 1996 but are not operational. Welty said he expects the channels
to begin programming by December 2004 or sooner, after a satellite is
launched.</LD>
<LD>   He said he pulled the endowment offer to Trinity International
University "because they never accepted it."</LD>
<TE>   But Welty also said that the university's firing of Trinity Law
School Dean Winston L. Frost last year "was the catalyst that led me
to revoke the gift."</TE>
<TE>   School officials accused Frost of plagiarizing an article that
appeared in the school's law review, which Frost denied. Welty did
not defend Frost's article but said the dean was fired without due
process. "Trinity didn't live up to the principles of a Christian law
school in the way they terminated him," Welty said. "The process was
arbitrary and unfair."</TE>
<TE>   Wes Anderson, Trinity International University's chief financial
officer, said Friday that the school considers Welty's gift
irrevocable.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that a change made to the 1996 agreement about a year
ago made Bill's gift irrevocable," said Anderson, who acknowledged
that the school received Welty's letter of revocation. "That's our
position. I can't say much more, except that it's all under legal
review by our lawyers."</TE>
<TE>   The trust's channels are similar to those owned by DirectTV and
EchoStar Communications, which provide satellite TV and audio
programming, said satellite television analyst Jimmy Schaeffler.
Schaeffler, head of the Carmel Group, appraised the channels at $258
million in 1996 for Welty. "Based on what has happened in the
direct-broadcast satellite industry since, and the success of
DirectTV and EchoStar, I guess they're worth a lot more today," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Welty's trust reached an agreement with Trinity
International University, based in Illinois, to turn over some of the
income generated by the channels. The university, which includes
Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, is run by the Evangelical Free
Church of America.</TE>
<TE>   However, the channels have generated no income because a satellite
for programming has not been launched. Welty said the FCC has
required that a satellite be working by December 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "Once it's operational, we anticipate an annual income of about $8
million," Welty said. "We were going to use $7 million of that to
endow Trinity Divinity School and make it tuition-free for all
students."</TE>
<TE>   Welty said he is a graduate of the divinity school.</TE>
<TE>   He informed Trinity of the gift's revocation in a Jan. 29 letter
to university President Greg Waybright, who did not return telephone
calls seeking comment. But Trinity spokesman Zach Kincaid said he was
aware of Welty's letter and added, "It's a sensitive thing around
here."</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, Welty gave other reasons for pulling the gift,
including what he said was the university's failure to report it "to
appropriate taxing authorities or to members of the Evangelical Free
Church." The requirements for reporting the offer are unclear, since
the gift does not yet generate any income and therefore does not have
value to the school.</TE>
<TE>   That alleged failure "connotes de facto rejection of our gift
offer at worst or at best a decision not to accept it," said the
letter. Anderson said he could not comment on the reasons Welty gave
for withdrawing the gift.</TE>
<TE>   Welty said he has had discussions with another private university
about transferring the gift but declined to identify the school.</TE>

<HD>Oil Companies Lose Fullerton Cleanup Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: Federal judges say fuel firms--not the
government--should pay for the McColl site, restored in '98, which
was a WWII toxic dump area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oil companies must pay for nearly all of the $100-million cleanup of
the McColl site in Fullerton, which was used as a toxic dump during
World Word II, a federal appeals court ruled Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling reverses a lower court's decision that held the U.S.
government responsible for the cleanup of the 22-acre site. The
cleanup was declared a high priority shortly after the federal
Superfund cleanup law was enacted in 1980. The oil companies
manufacturing aviation fuel for the war dumped more than 100,000
cubic yards of toxic byproducts on the site during the 1940s. Cleanup
was completed in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Atlantic Richfield Co., Shell Oil Co., Texaco Inc. and Union Oil
Co. of California argued that the federal government should pay for
the cleanup because of its role in urging gasoline production during
World War II. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the oil
companies were responsible for the dumping.</LD>
<TE>   A Decision to Pursue Further Appeal Pending</TE>
<TE>   "I think [the decision] was wrong," said Peter Taft, a Los Angeles
attorney representing the oil companies. "They did not give adequate
consideration to the [federal government's] coercion on the companies
to produce and therefore [force] them to dump under the wartime
situation."</TE>
<TE>   He said the companies, which already paid for most of the cleanup,
have not yet decided whether to appeal the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to reach U.S. Department of Justice attorneys familiar
with the case were unsuccessful. However, lawyers for the state of
California and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency were pleased
with the ruling on the 11-year-old case.</TE>
<TE>   People across the country knew about the hazardous pollution at
the site. Oily, acidic sludge--a byproduct of manufacturing jet
fuel--was dumped into pits at the McColl site. Homeowners began
complaining about odors and health problems after a neighborhood was
built nearby in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "Six of the 12 sludge pits were open and the other six were
underneath a golf course. Sludge would ooze up out of the earth
during the hot summer months," said Timothy Patterson, a deputy
attorney general representing the state of California.</TE>
<TE>   Testing found sulfuric acid, benzene and other harmful substances.
The site was declared a federal Superfund site in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   After years of debate, oil officials, local activists and federal
officials agreed on a solution: The pits were covered and topped by a
multilayered cap. A gas-collection system and groundwater equipment
were installed to monitor the site.</TE>
<TE>   The property became three holes of the Los Coyotes Country Club in
Buena Park. Although the oil companies paid for most of the cleanup,
they still were battling the 1991 lawsuit brought by the government
against them.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really is one of the Superfund success stories in terms
of cleanup," Patterson said.</TE>
<TE>   However, one neighbor who helped with the cleanup said it never
would have happened without the oil companies' cooperation, and that
they shouldn't be held responsible for what the federal government
forced them to do decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether you like the oil companies or not, they were ordered by
the government to do something," said David Bushey, who has lived for
24 years at a Fairgreen Drive home that abuts the McColl site.</TE>
<TE>   "Had they not, their officers would have been arrested and thrown
in jail for war crimes or something. They did their duty.</TE>
<TE>   "To throw it all back on them is really a shame. The fact is they
stepped up to [the] plate and went ahead and put their money up to do
the cleanup. Justice wasn't done."</TE>

<KH>THE FALL OF ENRON</KH>
<HD>Enron Ex-Employee Groups Seek Voice in Bankruptcy
Proceedings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Laid-off Enron Corp. workers have asked a Bankruptcy Court judge to
give them a major voice in deciding how creditors are repaid and how
the company will be restructured.</LD>
<LD>   Three separate groups of former employees have petitioned U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez to be named an official creditor
committee.</LD>
<LD>   The legal designation could give former workers significant
leverage as the court oversees issues such as financial settlements
with current Enron management and with other creditors. Many Enron
employees suffered huge losses in their retirement savings plans as
the company's stock collapsed.</LD>
<TE>   The Bankruptcy Court has named one creditor committee so far in
the Enron case. But that group is composed largely of banks and other
large institutions, and ex-employees complain that it doesn't have
their interests at heart. That 15-member committee has a single
employee representative, a former Enron lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever an issue arises where the employees want something
different than the J.P. Morgan Chases of the world want, they'll at
best have one vote out of 15," said Jeff Boyd, the Texas deputy
attorney general whose office is one of the groups seeking to
represent former employees.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez has set a Feb. 27 hearing to consider the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, few bankruptcy cases have had employee creditor
committees, experts said. Judges in most cases assign just one group
to speak for all parties. The idea is that it's easier for the
company to negotiate with a single set of creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the groups of former Enron workers expect to face stiff
opposition--not only from other creditors but from the company
itself. Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the firm believes former
employees are adequately represented by the existing committee.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect opposition from every camp," said Scott Baena, an
attorney for one of the two private employee groups.</TE>
<TE>   However, Gonzalez signaled in an earlier ruling that he would he
be willing to consider an employee committee. If the judge were to
approve the formation of such a committee, the individual members
would be selected by the trustee overseeing the case.</TE>
<TE>   The trustee also has the option to approve the formation of a
second committee at any time, potentially eliminating the need for
the court hearing.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Texas attorney general's group, two private
groups are vying to represent former employees: the Severed Enron
Employees Coalition and the Ad Hoc Committee of Former Enron
Employees.</TE>
<TE>   If either private group is approved it could mean a financial
bonanza for their lawyers, experts said. That's because Enron would
be required to pay the legal bills of any official committee. For the
lawyers, that means a guaranteed payday.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, lawyers often jockey to be chosen for such
committees, legal authorities said. The strategy, according to UCLA
law professor Lynn LoPucki, is to team up with the workers who are
most likely to be appointed to the committee--and who then would be
in a position to hire the lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an elaborate process by which the lawyers compete,"
LoPucki said. "The first step is for their clients to get on the
committee and the second is for the committee to hire them as
counsel."</TE>
<TE>   David McClain, an attorney representing the Ad Hoc ex-employee
group, said his goal is to make sure employees are treated fairly in
the bankruptcy case. "I would like the committee to hire me, but I
don't have any assurances they will," he said. "If I don't get any
money out of this, it's OK. This [battle for employees] is the good
fight."</TE>
<TE>   Having their legal tab picked up by the company would give former
employees enormous clout at the bargaining table, LoPucki said.
Because employees would have the financial wherewithal to mount a
prolonged fight, Enron management would be much more likely to accede
to their demands at the bargaining table, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1990 study that he co-authored, LoPucki found that groups
represented by official committees had great success in winning
settlements at the bargaining table.</TE>
<TE>   In 43 large bankruptcies from 1980 to 1988, LoPucki found that
every group represented by an official committee received some
financial settlement--even if the legal cases of some groups were so
weak that they almost certainly would have lost in a court decision,
he said.</TE>

<HD>NBC Clinches Deal for New 'Friends' Season</HD>
<DH>Television: Stars of hit series sign for a reported $1
million each per episode.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD and BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC finalized a deal Monday that will secure another season of
"Friends," with the cast of prime time's top-rated series signing for
an additional year at a salary believed to exceed $1 million for each
cast member per episode.</LD>
<LD>   Although NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., will be hard pressed
to make money on the show at that high a fee, its renewal seemed
increasingly imperative as ratings for the series have soared this
season, weathering a challenge from CBS' "Survivor."</LD>
<LD>   Representatives for NBC and AOL Time Warner Inc. unit Warner Bros.
Television, which produces "Friends," announced the agreement late
Monday, with NBC Entertainment President Jeff Zucker saying in a
statement that it is "no secret how important 'Friends' is to NBC."
The parties declined to discuss specifics of the deal, but sources
said the network will pay nearly $6.5million an episode, or more than
$150million for the season, making it one of the most expensive half
hours in TV history. AOL Time Warner would shoulder the balance of
the production costs.</LD>
<TE>   The cast, with advances against profits from the show's reruns
figured in, earns more than $900,000 an episode per actor under an
agreement that expires this spring.</TE>
<TE>   At 24 episodes per season, each actor is expected to receive
roughly $25 million for what will by all accounts be the show's final
year.</TE>
<TE>   Several sources said the cast members had thought this would be
the show's last season before its lofty ratings and perceived
creative resurgence prompted them to reconsider and agree to
continue.</TE>
<TE>   "They have [other] things in their lives; this was supposed to
end," said a source close to the cast, noting that the outpouring of
affection for the series had an effect on the stars' decision to
return.</TE>
<TE>   During more difficult renewal negotiations two years ago, when a
deal was finalized less than 36 hours before NBC was scheduled to
announce its fall lineup of shows in New York, "Friends" stars
Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc,
Courteney Cox Arquette and Matthew Perry presented a united front in
sealing a landmark package to stay with the show two more years.</TE>
<TE>   Though that deal involved financial incentives on various levels,
including back-end profit participation, the current negotiation was
said to be more straightforward.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the raises put the six actors in the company of sitcom
stars such as Jerry Seinfeld and Tim Allen in the latter years of
"Seinfeld" and "Home Improvement," as well as "Frasier" star Kelsey
Grammer.</TE>
<TE>   NBC desperately needs the series to maintain its ratings supremacy
among the younger demographics sought by advertisers and to plant the
seeds of future hits. As it is, the network has struggled to build
successful new comedies behind "Friends" on Thursday--a night when
movie studios pay a premium to promote their upcoming releases.</TE>
<TE>   "The 8 o'clock time period is really important," said Tim
Spengler, executive vice president and director of national broadcast
at Initiative Media North America, a major media-buying firm, adding
that without "Friends" to lead off Thursdays for NBC, "the whole
night could crumble."</TE>

<HD>Cheating Death by Leading Rare Life</HD>
<DH>Health: Anaheim school trustee Benny Hernandez is beyond
terminal in medicine's view. His secret seems to be sheer desire to
spread love and hope.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first time doctors expected Benny Hernandez to die, he was 3
months old and had a severe case of pneumonia. The infant had no more
than three days left, doctors predicted.</LD>
<LD>   His parents took him home and prayed. And he lived.</LD>
<LD>   His devout father told him in the years that followed: "God had a
plan for you. He has given you life, more than once. Twice."</LD>
<TE>   Now, the Anaheim Union High School District trustee, famed for
unseating an incumbent after spending $8.13 on his campaign, is
living under another death sentence. It was issued in January 2001,
when doctors told him an aggressive brain tumor would leave him six,
eight, maybe 12 weeks to live. So Hernandez, 45, quit his job as a
sixth-grade teacher in Compton and vowed to use his remaining time to
touch the lives of others.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen months later, Hernandez travels all over Southern
California, giving inspirational talks to community groups, schools
and churches. He tells people that each day is worth living, no
matter how many--or few--we are granted. He still attends school
board meetings when his health allows, and may run for Anaheim mayor.
Not that the medical news is good. Doctors have gone through his
skull twice to remove two tennis-ball-sized tumors. A third tumor is
growing fast.</TE>
<TE>   Two months after his election to the school board, Hernandez's
first tumor came with a headache so severe it forced him into the
emergency room.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, tests revealed the fast-growing, cancerous tumor. It
was the worst kind, glioblastoma multiforme, with tentacles that dig
so deep into the brain they can never be completely removed. Doctors
wasted no time; within a few days, they performed surgery that left
Hernandez with a scar the shape of a lucky horseshoe. And they told
him the bad news.</TE>
<TE>   His mother and older brother, in Colorado, put their lives on hold
to move closer to him.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Hernandez says he and his younger brother maintained a so-so
relationship for years. As he prepared to spend his brother's last
days with him, he thought, "How close can I get to Benny in 12
weeks?"</TE>
<TE>   But the news didn't seem to devastate Benny Hernandez as it did
his family. After surgery, he immediately started planning for the
future, as if he didn't comprehend his fate. The surgeon pulled Henry
Hernandez aside and told him: "I don't know if your brother
understands the seriousness of this. On a scale from one to four,
four being most serious, my take is that he's on five."</TE>
<TE>   Henry Hernandez is still with his brother.</TE>
<TE>   But while Benny Hernandez's tumors have not killed him, they have
taken away many of the skills he once took for granted. Until
Hernandez later regained some of his motor skills, his brother helped
dress him and escort him to countless meetings. Henry Hernandez has
provided the doctor with the difficult, honest updates on how his
brother is doing. No, Benny Hernandez often doesn't remember what day
it is. Yes, he needs to be reminded two, three, sometimes four times
a day.</TE>
<TE>   In other ways, though, Hernandez is full of life. "I want to spend
my last days reaching out to other people," he said. "I think that's
the greatest reward.... I will keep going until my last breath."</TE>
<TE>   He is visiting every school in Anaheim. There, he tells children
to go to college, get educated. Be somebody. When he talks in
churches, he jokes that the tumor is God's way of making him pray and
meditate more. He has lunch and dinner with friends. On many days, he
is up early and out late.</TE>
<TE>   The one thing that makes him cry is his wish to have more time
with his son, Alex, 8, whose birthday he marked by bringing a cake to
school and singing.</TE>
<TE>   In May, after 12 weeks of radiation treatment and about the time
doctors originally thought he would be dead, Hernandez took the trip
of a lifetime. An old college friend, Kathy Lopez, had heard about
the tumor. She tracked him down, renewed their friendship. As a
social worker, she was fascinated by Hernandez's attitude. "It just
kind of drew me to him," Lopez said. "I would go to church to hear
him. I had to be there all the time, be around somebody who was so
positive."</TE>
<TE>   She asked if there was anywhere he wanted to go but hadn't been.
He mentioned the Great Wall of China. She blurted out, "I'll take
you."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez is still awed by the social touch Hernandez displayed on
that trip, striking up conversations with strangers everywhere they
went. A few months later, the second tumor was causing problems.
Hernandez lost peripheral vision and motor skills. He couldn't walk
without a cane. In September, surgeons cut out two tumors that had
merged into one. But the operation was a success and much of
Hernandez's mobility was restored.</TE>
<TE>   Still, his driving days are over, and he walks slowly, his eyes
sweeping back and forth in front of him to compensate for the loss of
peripheral vision.</TE>
<TE>   The third tumor is growing. The doctor said to pray that it grows
outward, where he can grab it. Hernandez replied: "I'll grow 'em. You
scoop 'em."</TE>
<TE>   During the latest appointment, the doctor didn't issue an opinion
on the amount of time Hernandez has left. Hernandez never listens
anyway.</TE>

<HD>2 Students Sentenced for Visa Violations</HD>
<DH>Court: They get jail terms, face deportation. Pair had been
detained after Sept. 11 attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two foreign students detained by U.S. officials in their hunt for
members of the Al Qaeda terrorist network were sentenced in Los
Angeles federal court Monday for visa violations.</LD>
<LD>   Ahmed Nawaz Atta, a 19-year-old Pakistani studying computer
science at Irvine Valley College, was sentenced by U.S. District
Judge William Rea to the two months he had served in custody.</LD>
<LD>   Atta, who now faces deportation, was accused of lying about his
immigration status when he took a job at Fry's Electronics. Foreign
students are barred from taking jobs in the United States without
permission from the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</LD>
<TE>   In court Monday, he said he was forced to find work because his
father could no longer support him in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Another student, Sami Med Fathi ben Hafaiedh, 28, described a
similar predicament when he appeared for sentencing Monday before
U.S. District Judge Manuel Real on charges of lying about his student
visa.</TE>
<TE>   Hafaiedh, enrolled at an English language school, apologized for
breaking the law, but said he was forced to do so because of economic
necessity.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Tunisia, Hafaiedh was picked up in an immigration raid
on a Glendale food market after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Real sentenced him to six months in prison. Afterward, Mary Kelly,
a federal public defender, expressed disappointment with the
sentence. She had asked for a shorter sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Hafaiedh and Atta will be turned over to immigration authorities
for deportation after their release.</TE>
<TE>   Before being charged with criminal violations, the two men had
been ordered deported after a hearing by an INS administrative law
judge.</TE>
<TE>   In view of the deportation orders, defense lawyers argued that
prosecuting Atta and Hafaiedh on criminal charges served no purpose
and represented a departure from past practice at the U.S. attorney's
office.</TE>
<TE>   The two defendants were among more than 1,100 people, mostly young
men with Middle Eastern backgrounds, who were taken into custody
under broad, new powers given to the Justice Department to
investigate suspected terrorists after the September attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Neither man was ever linked in court proceedings to Al Qaeda or
any terrorist group.</TE>

<HD>Viacom May Purchase KCAL for $600 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Media giant Viacom Inc. is purchasing KCAL Channel 9--the last
independent major broadcast station in the Los Angeles market--for a
rumored price of $600 million, insiders said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Executives for Viacom declined to comment, and representatives for
KCAL and Young Broadcasting Inc., the station's owner, could not be
reached.</LD>
<LD>   Under the proposed agreement, Viacom, which owns CBS and its Los
Angeles outlet KCBS-TV  Channel 2, would operate both local stations,
under what is known as a duopoly.</LD>
<TE>   KCAL's centerpiece is a three-hour prime-time news block, largely
because the station has lacked the resources to bid aggressively for
programming against other local broadcasters, which are affiliated
with networks. The station is the only independent VHF outlet
(stations positioned from Channels 2 through 13) in the nation's
second-largest television market.</TE>
<TE>   Insiders speculated that since Viacom owns CBS and the fledgling
UPN network, the company would eventually seek to switch KCAL to UPN.
KCOP Channel 13, the current UPN affiliate, was acquired last year by
News Corp., the parent of the Fox television network, which also owns
KTTV Channel 11.</TE>
<TE>   KTLA Channel 5, which is affiliated with the WB network, is owned
by Tribune Co., owner of the Los Angeles Times.</TE>
<TE>   Relaxation of Federal Communications Commission regulations has
cleared the way for a series of TV station sales, including
elimination of a rule that prevented duopolies--that is, a single
entity owning two television stations in a single market.</TE>
<TE>   Operating two stations is attractive because it allows station
owners to combine and streamline operating costs, while providing
them more leverage in negotiating for program rights and the sale of
advertising time. In addition to KTTV and KCOP, General Electric Co.,
owner of NBC and KNBC Channel 4 in Los Angeles, recently agreed to
acquire the Spanish-language Telemundo network and its Los Angeles
outlet, KVEA.</TE>
<TE>   KCAL was bought by Young Broadcasting from Walt Disney Co. in
1996. Disney was forced to sell KCAL when the studio acquired Capital
Cities ABC, which owned KABC-TV Channel 7 locally, to comply with the
duopoly restriction that existed at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Management for KCAL and Young has touted its commitment to news,
sports (including local broadcast rights to the L.A. Lakers) and
community programming. The station recently added a 4 p.m. newscast
to its lineup.</TE>

<HD>Davis to Reveal Plans for Federal Farm Funding</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis will announce plans today to distribute $63 million
in federal funds to help specialty crop producers.</LD>
<LD>   The grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture will be used for
marketing, promoting food safety and nutrition, and conducting crop
research, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   The money is part of a $5.5-billion supplemental farm aid package
approved by President Bush last year that provides economic aid to
growers of specialty crops, mostly fruits and vegetables. The
Agricultural Economic Assistance Act targeted California specialty
crop growers who don't receive traditional farm subsidy money.</LD>
<TE>   The grant was awarded to the California Department of Food and
Agriculture, which will distribute aid to farmers. Davis will
announce details of the program at the World Ag Expo in Tulare.</TE>

<HD>U.S. May Oust Security Firm From Airports</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The government is trying to put troubled Argenbright Security Inc.
out of the security business at U.S. airports.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Aviation Administration is seeking bids from other
security companies to take over Argenbright's airline security
operations.</LD>
<LD>   Argenbright has 40% of the market.</LD>
<TE>   The FAA now oversees airline security, but that responsibility
will shift to the new Transportation Security Administration on
Sunday. The new agency also will supervise security screeners, a job
now done by the airline industry.</TE>
<TE>   By Nov. 19, about 30,000 federal employees, hired and trained by
the TSA, will screen all passengers and luggage.</TE>
<TE>   An Argenbright spokeswoman, Cynthia Faulkner, said the company was
"ready to work with DOT and TSA and the aviation authorities during
the transition period."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said the
government would not sign any new contracts with Argenbright but that
the company would continue its current operations.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Transportation Department doesn't want Argenbright to
handle any airport security.</TE>

<HD>Mann Buys Half of Lockheed Facility</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB HOWARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Biotechnology pioneer Alfred Mann has acquired almost half of a
377-acre former Lockheed aerospace research facility at Rye Canyon in
Valencia for a project called Mann Biomedical Park, boosting the
Santa Clarita Valley's reputation as an emerging biotech center.</LD>
<LD>   The new biomedical park will be designed to accommodate other Mann
companies in addition to one called Advanced Bionics that already
occupies space at Rye Canyon, said John DelRusso, director of
facilities for Advanced Bionics.</LD>
<LD>   Mann bought the land in what is now known as Rye Canyon Business
Park from a partnership of Foster City, Calif.-based developer Legacy
Partners. DelRusso said the property was acquired through a newly
formed company called Mann Biomedical Park LLC.</LD>
<TE>   The 160 acres that Mann purchased includes about 420,000 square
feet of industrial buildings, most of which were renovated by Legacy.
About two-thirds of the property is occupied, said DelRusso, who said
the new owners will market the remaining space to prospective
tenants.</TE>
<TE>   Besides filling the existing space, Mann expects to build
facilities at Rye Canyon. DelRusso said it's too early to say which
companies will locate there or how much new space Mann expects to
build.</TE>
<TE>   Advanced Bionics, which operates its research center and
administrative offices in 90,000 square feet at Rye Canyon, is
already building about 66,000 square feet of additional space there
and plans to move its manufacturing to Rye Canyon from Sylmar. The
company is one of a number of biomedical firms founded by Mann, who
pioneered such medical devices as heart pacemakers and hearing
implants. Mann's land purchase, which is in a portion of Valencia
within the city of Santa Clarita, was the second in recent weeks by a
biomedical firm with plans to move to Valencia.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica-based Specialty Laboratories Inc. bought nearly 14
acres in Valencia Corporate Center at Interstate 5 and Valencia
Boulevard, where the firm plans to build a 200,000-square-foot lab
and corporate headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Terms of the Rye Canyon land sale were not disclosed. Legacy and
partner Goldman Sachs paid about $20 million in 1998 for the 377-acre
Rye Canyon property, which was known as Kelly Johnson Research Center
when it was operated by Lockheed.</TE>
<TE>   Mann was represented in the land purchase by Jim Linn of Grubb &amp;
Ellis. The sellers were represented by Craig Peters and Doug
Sonderegger of CB Richard Ellis.</TE>

<HD>WellPoint Health Profit Rises 23%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WellPoint Health Networks Inc., one of California's biggest health
insurers, said fourth-quarter profit rose 23%, beating estimates, as
the firm added customers and raised premiums.</LD>
<LD>   Net income rose to $109.9 million, or $1.65 a share, from $89.5
million, or $1.37 a share, a year earlier, WellPoint said in a news
release. Revenue rose 40% to $3.42 billion from $2.44 billion.</LD>
<LD>   WellPoint, the parent of Blue Cross of California, has signed up
profitable customers by offering patients a range of co-payments for
medical care and a greater choice of doctors than some rivals. The
company also has acquired Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies in
Georgia and Missouri, giving it a presence on the East Coast and in
the Midwest.</LD>
<TE>   "Pretty much across the board, it's a good quarter," said ABN Amro
Inc. analyst Peter Costa, who has a "buy" on WellPoint and doesn't
own the shares. "They're starting to get diversified out of
California, which is a good thing. They're getting what I'd say is
some good strength in the major markets."</TE>
<TE>   The Thousand Oaks-based insurer was forecast to earn $1.59 a
share, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson
Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   WellPoint announced earnings after U.S. markets closed. Shares of
the company rose $1.30 to $127.29 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The company had 10.1 million customers as of Dec. 31, an increase
of 28% from 7.9 million the year before.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Leonard Schaeffer wants WellPoint to gain a
foothold in the Midwest, Southeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the
U.S. to compete with rivals such as Cigna Corp., UnitedHealth Group
Inc. and the biggest U.S. health insurer, Aetna Inc.</TE>
<TE>   WellPoint gained 1.9 million customers in March when the insurer
bought Atlanta-based Cerulean Cos., the parent of Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of Georgia.</TE>

<HD>Craig Realty Group Planning to Remodel, Expand Citadel</HD>

<LD>A Newport Beach developer plans to remodel and expand the Citadel
Outlets shopping center, a former tire factory along the Santa Ana
Freeway in Commerce that looks like an Assyrian temple.</LD>
<LD>   Craig Realty Group has assumed management of Citadel Outlets and
has six months to negotiate a deal to buy the center from the city
for about $50 million.</LD>
<LD>   The 147,000-square-foot outlet center, about nine miles southeast
of downtown Los Angeles, includes 42 stores on a site originally
built as a Samson Tire &amp; Rubber Co. plant, later operated by
Uniroyal, and converted to an outlet mall 10 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Craig's plan would expand the center by 100,000 square feet,
adding 18 to 23 new stores by summer 2003 and creating a new look for
the interior along with a new entrance and parking layout.</TE>
<TE>   The remodeling would preserve the Citadel's 22-foot-high wall,
which the city designated a cultural landmark in the early 1980s,
said Raymond Ramirez, assistant director of community development for
Commerce. The wall, which runs a third of a mile along the freeway,
features bas-relief griffins, winged genies and warriors in chariots
in a design inspired by ancient Assyria.</TE>
<TE>   The city has been looking for a developer to remodel and expand
the outlet center, which has become dated.</TE>
<TE>   Commerce chose to negotiate exclusively with Craig, Ramirez said,
because of the firm's reputation and experience developing and
operating outlet centers.</TE>
<TE>   Craig operates five outlet centers on the West Coast, including
Carlsbad Company Stores in Carlsbad and Cabazon Outlets near Palm
Springs.</TE>

<HD>Kennedy-Wilson Plans to Raise $23 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kennedy-Wilson Inc. said it plans to raise $23.1 million by selling
about a 25% stake in its Japanese unit and use the proceeds to make
more purchases.</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy-Wilson will sell 7,000 shares at $3,300 each in
Kennedy-Wilson Japan Inc. The shares, being sold through a group of
underwriters led by Nikko Salomon Smith Barney, will start trading
Feb. 19 on Nasdaq Japan.</LD>
<LD>   The expected sales price values the unit at about $93.4 million.
Kennedy-Wilson will retain about 14,300 shares, or a 50% stake, in
the unit, said Richard Mandel, president of the Beverly Hills-based
real estate investment and advisory firm's commercial property
division.</LD>
<TE>   When the company announced the plan to sell the shares in
September, Mandel said the sale would let Kennedy-Wilson continue
buying Japanese real estate assets and loans. Outside investors will
retain about 25% of the unit, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Japan has been trying to address a problem of soured real estate
loans and investments. To help bring more capital into property
markets, government officials made it possible for real estate
investment funds to sell shares to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy-Wilson and its Japanese partners have acquired about 22
office buildings worth about $400 million. They also have spent about
$150 million buying bad loans with a face value of $2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The company's shares rose 5 cents to $4.70 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>Strategies for financing and developing apartment buildings in Los
Angeles despite the shortage of new building sites will be the topic
of a conference presented by the Urban Land Institute and the Richard
S. Ziman Center for Real Estate on Feb. 20 at UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning with a reception at 6 p.m., the event at Korn
Convocation Hall will include a case study of an apartment project in
the San Fernando Valley and a discussion of how prospective
developers can identify and complete similar "infill" projects, which
are developments of relatively small parcels of land in otherwise
fully developed areas or redevelopments of existing properties in
fully developed neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   Cost of the event is $55 in advance for non-members and $25 for
public officials and students, $10 more for on-site registration. For

<HD>DuPont Mulls Textile Spinoff</HD>
<DH>Chemicals: Firm plans to reorganize, create interiors
business that could be sold to public.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DuPont Co. could spin off its $6.5-billion textiles and interiors
business as part of a broad corporate restructuring announced Monday.</LD>
<LD>   After years of trying to position itself as a science company,
DuPont's latest plan calls for it to reorganize into five specialized
businesses and create a textiles and interiors unit that later could
be sold through an initial public offering.</LD>
<LD>   Long concerned about DuPont's lackluster profit, investors reacted
positively to the announcement, sending shares of the Wilmington,
Del.-based company up more than 4% on the New York Stock Exchange.
Shares of DuPont rose $1.84 to close at $44.56 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   The textiles and interiors business, which has been hurt by stiff
competition from abroad, would boast $6.5 billion in sales--23% of
the company's total sales--and would be the world's largest
integrated fiber concern.</TE>
<TE>   DuPont hired Morgan Stanley to study the possible spinoff and
hopes to separate the textiles and interiors business by late next
year, it said.</TE>
<TE>   Expenses relating to the separation would be covered by
"aggressively" cutting costs in the company's corporate and support
services.</TE>
<TE>   The concern includes Lycra fabrics and Stainmaster carpets and the
polyester and nylon business of DuPont, which invented nylon in the
late 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   DuPont has sold its pharmaceuticals unit to Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co. and completed its spinoff of Conoco Inc. in 1999, divesting
itself of the oil and gas company it acquired for $7.6 billion in
1981.</TE>
<TE>   DuPont's announcement came the same day Eastman Chemical Co.
canceled plans to spin off its specialty chemicals and plastics
business.</TE>
<TE>   DuPont also has been hard hit by low prices for its chemicals and
plastics in the face of the U.S. economic recession.</TE>
<TE>   It now plans to divide into five businesses in addition to
creatingthe textiles and interiors subsidiary.</TE>
<TE>   The five businesses would be electronic and communications
technologies; performance materials; coatings and color technologies;
agriculture and nutrition; and safety.</TE>

<LD>Almost one-third of the employees fired by Enron have found new jobs
less than two months later, an informal survey of more than 600
former employees shows.</LD>
<LD>   That's about half the average time needed to find work in Texas,
where it took workers about 15 weeks to find a job in the second half
of last year, according to the Texas Workforce Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Still, many ex-Enron workers saw their retirement savings wiped

<HD>Insurers Boosting Liability Rates for Execs Due to Enron
Collapse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shareholder lawsuits stemming from the collapse of Enron Corp. are
prompting insurers to raise the price of coverage for corporate
executives and directors against claims of mismanagement.</LD>
<LD>   Companies with market values of more than $1 billion face premium
increases of more than 50%, according to Willis Group Holdings Inc.,
the third-largest insurance broker.</LD>
<LD>   Mary Gardner, a risk manager at Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. in Hoffman
Estates, Ill., said she is concerned about rate increases. Sears
covers its directors and officers through National Union Fire
Insurance Co., a unit of American International Group Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Even before the litigation targeting Enron and its former auditor,
Andersen, insurers were driving up rates to recoup losses from the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and from securities fraud lawsuits after
the plunge in dot-com stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Now they're raising prices more, anticipating record Enron-related
settlements.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, a record 500 cases were filed against companies and their
directors and officers, said James Newman, executive director of
Securities Class Action Services, which publishes Securities Class
Action Alert. In the five years through 2000, there were 200 to 300
class actions filed each year.</TE>
<TE>   The average settlement also has grown. In 2000, the average
settlement was $25 million, up from $17.5 million in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next year, there are cases that may settle for about $500
million, Newman said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, companies that have paid $5,000 to $10,000 for every $1
million of coverage for the first $50 million are paying $25,000 or
$30,000 per $1 million for the same coverage, said Susanne Murray,
leader of the directors and officers practice of Willis Group.</TE>

<HD>Skilling's Mother Says Son Should Have Known</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The mother of former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling says
he should have known the company was facing extreme financial
trouble, Newsweek magazine reported.</LD>
<LD>   "When you are the CEO and you are on the board of directors, you
are supposed to know what's going on with the rest of the company,"
the magazine quoted 77-year-old Betty Skilling as saying in an
interview before her son testified last week. "You can't get off the
hook with me there.... He's going to have to beat this the best way
he can," she said.</LD>
<LD>   Testifying voluntarily Thursday before the House Energy
subcommittee on oversight and investigation, Skilling took no blame
for the bankrupt energy trader's collapse and said he had no reason
to believe it was in financial trouble when he left the company in

<TE>   Skilling said at the time that he was resigning "for personal
reasons."</TE>
<TE>   Betty Skilling had her doubts, according to Newsweek. "I don't
think he knew he was in such high water, but I think he must have had
some idea because he resigned," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling's father, Tom Skilling, said, "I've never known him to do
a dishonest thing in his life."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Monday, California officials said Skilling actively
pitched one of Enron's partnerships to a California investment fund
in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Controller Kathleen Connell said a transcript of a December 1997
meeting of the California Public Employees' Retirement System
(CalPERS) board of directors showed Skilling answered detailed
questions about the investment deal, known as Jedi II.</TE>
<TE>   Connell released parts of the transcript to the San Jose Mercury
News, editing out all but her own comments in deference to CalPERS
lawyers, who ruled that a full transcript of the closed door meeting
was not a part of the public record.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Resigns From 3 Enron-Related Firms</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three energy companies affiliated with Enron said Monday that
Andersen had resigned as their auditor because of independence
concerns, in a sign that the beleaguered accounting firm is rapidly
moving to distance itself from the bankrupt energy trader.</LD>
<LD>   Natural gas pipeline operator Northern Border Partners said
Andersen had resigned as its auditor as of Feb. 5, citing concerns
over its ability to perform independently in light of recent events.
Enron Northern Plains Natural Gas Co. and Pan Border Gas Co., which
are wholly owned subsidiaries of Enron, are general partners in the
Northern Border partnership.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen also withdrew as auditor of Portland General Electric, a
regional electric utility, and EOTT Energy Partners, a crude oil
marketing and transportation firm. Both are Enron affiliates.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Heavy cost cutting and promotions have helped Walt Disney Co.'s theme
parks show slow but steady improvement in business since Sept. 11,
the company said.</LD>
<LD>   Overall attendance at Walt Disney World is 10% to 15% below last
year's levels, compared with a 20% decline in the first quarter of
its fiscal year, said Paul Pressler, chairman of Walt Disney Parks
and Resorts. . At Disneyland Resort, attendance is up from last year
because of the opening of California Adventure. Pressler also said
business was up at Disney Cruise Line and the Disney Vacation Club.</LD>
<LD>   Pressler expressed caution about a quick turnaround, noting that a
slowdown in international travel continues to put the squeeze on Walt
Disney World, where 50% of all guests arrive by plane.</LD>

<HD>Viacom to Write Down $15 Billion in 'Goodwill'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Viacom Inc., the third-largest media company, probably will write
down as much as $15 billion of "goodwill" from the purchase of
companies including Blockbuster Entertainment and CBS Corp., analysts
said.</LD>
<LD>   Under a new U.S. accounting rule that took effect this year,
Viacom may reduce the value of its $72 billion in goodwill--the
difference between the purchase price of an asset and its book
value--as soon as the first quarter. AOL Time Warner said last month
it would take a goodwill-related expense of as much as $60 billion in
the first quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Viacom may write down goodwill from its $8-billion purchase of
Blockbuster in 1994 and its $50-billion acquisition of CBS two years
ago, analysts said. Under the new rules, Viacom no longer must write
down, or amortize, a part of goodwill every quarter. The change will
increase the firm's reported profit.</LD>

<HD>Fleetwood's Top Two Execs Step Down</HD>
<DH>Management: CEO Potter and Chairman Kummer retire amid
mobile-home slump.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fleetwood Enterprises Inc., the nation's second-largest producer of
manufactured homes that has been mired in a deep slump since
mid-1999, replaced its top two executives Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Nelson Potter resigned as the Riverside company's chief executive
and president to pursue other interests, the company said. He also is
leaving the board of directors. Chairman Glenn Kummer is retiring but
will remain on the board.</LD>
<LD>   The changes follow the company's report in December of a loss for
the quarter ended Oct. 28--the seventh straight quarterly deficit.</LD>
<TE>   "It's about time," said Michael Crawford, an analyst at B. Riley &amp;
Co. in Los Angeles. "It's not the same company it was when they took
charge. The business never performed up to expectations under their
leadership."</TE>
<TE>   The company, which is also the nation's largest producer of
recreational vehicles, has been slashing production amid an industry
slowing of sales for homes made in a factory. Fourteen of its 42
manufacturing plants have been closed.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Fleetwood has been unable to show much financial
improvement. "They have not turned around our profitability with the
speed which we would have preferred," said Kathy Snyder, director of
investor relations for the company.-</TE>
<TE>   Though traditional homebuilders have been enjoying record sales,
shipments of mobile homes have been plummeting, leaving dealers with
bulging inventories. The prime customers for those homes, mostly
blue-collar workers, have been hard hit by layoffs during the
recession. Moreover, GreenPoint Financial, one of the largest
mobile-home lenders in the nation, closed down in January as loan
defaults soared.</TE>
<TE>   "It's typical in this situation that management steps down,
because the company is facing an oversupplied marketplace and
short-term prospects for the industry are mediocre at best," said
Craig Silvers, a real estate analyst based in Los Angeles. "It's
probably time to bring in new management with fresh ideas."</TE>
<TE>   Both leaders were replaced with directors who will be interim
managers during a search to find long-term replacements.</TE>
<TE>   David Engelman, former chief executive of UnionFed Financial Corp.
and a company director since 1999, will take over as CEO. Thomas
Pitcher, a retired senior partner of a law firm who has been a
director since 1998, will assume Kummer's duties.</TE>
<TE>   Fleetwood's shares closed at $10.45, down 3 cents on the New York
Stock Exchange. The news was announced after the market closed.</TE>

<LD>Stocks rallied for the second straight session Monday as expectations
for an economic rebound overshadowed fears of shady accounting
practices.</LD>
<LD>   "The market has finally begun to look beyond the Enron cloud and
respond to what we believe are very positive fundamentals," said
Milton Ezrati, a senior economic strategist at Lord Abbett &amp; Co.</LD>
<LD>   Industrial stocks such as DuPont, Caterpillar and Nucor climbed as
investors positioned themselves for an anticipated recovery in the
U.S. economy this year.</LD>
<TE>   Wireless technology company Qualcomm and conglomerate Tyco
International bounced back after being pounded by accounting
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks gathered momentum throughout the session. The Dow Jones
industrial average jumped 140.54 points, or 1.4%, to 9,884.78, adding
to Friday's 119-point gain. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 27.78
points, or 1.5%, to 1,846.66. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose
15.72 points, or 1.4%, to 1,111.94.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers by 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by
4 to 3 on Nasdaq. Trading was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks snapped a five-session losing streak Friday, putting an end
to the longest string of losses in the market since September.
Investors are still on edge after the bankruptcy of Enron, but panic
over the prospect of another accounting scandal is subsiding,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Qualcomm rose $3.82 to $41.28 after defending its books Friday
after a research firm's report that raised concerns about the
wireless technology firm's accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco rose $1.92 to $31.80 and was again the most active NYSE
stock. The conglomerate has rallied in the last four sessions after
taking a beating when investors questioned its accounting.</TE>
<TE>   "People are getting more comfortable with the whole accounting
issue.... Companies are coming out pretty quickly when they are
attacked," said Owen Fitzpatrick, head of the U.S. Equity Group at
Deutsche Bank Private Banking.</TE>
<TE>   DuPont climbed $1.84 to $44.56, boosting the Dow. The largest U.S.
chemical company said it could spin off its $6.5-billion textiles and
interiors businesses as part of a broad restructuring.</TE>

<HD>SEC Demands Documents From Qwest</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Regulators want to examine transactions as part of
probe into Global Crossing's accounting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Securities investigators expanded their probe into the accounting at
Global Crossing Ltd., serving a subpoena on rival Qwest
Communications International for documents relating to deals between
the two communications companies.</LD>
<LD>   Qwest revealed the subpoena from the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Monday, saying that the request for documents was "in
connection with the SEC's investigation of Global Crossing."</LD>
<LD>   The two companies bought and sold at least $100 million of space
on each other's fiber-optic networks in a deal that Global Crossing
booked as cash revenue even though the deal produced no new cash,
according to allegations made by a former Global Crossing employee.</LD>
<TE>   It is common for carriers that own large communications networks
to buy capacity from one another to augment their systems and serve a
larger region. In the last year, however, some analysts have worried
that the practice had become something of an accounting game.</TE>
<TE>   A Qwest spokesman said that the Denver-based company is one of the
largest purchasers of capacity on Global Crossing's network but that
all of its contracts with Global are legitimate and accounted for
correctly.</TE>
<TE>   "There was never a case of a phantom transaction," said Qwest
spokesman Michael Tarpey. "We believe we've got documentation showing
specific [network] routes, with cash changing hands.... Everything is
buttoned up here according to [generally accepted accounting] rules."</TE>
<TE>   Tarpey said Qwest received the subpoena Friday and would submit
the requested documents to the SEC in two weeks. He said the company
is not a target of the SEC probe and has not been contacted by the
FBI, which has begun a separate inquiry into Global Crossing's
accounting practices, according to sources.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Olofson, former finance vice president at Global Crossing, has
accused the company of using faulty accounting and contrived "swaps"
of capacity with other carriers to inflate revenue and mislead
investors about Global Crossing's true financial condition.</TE>
<TE>   Olofson's allegations, outlined in an Aug. 6 letter to the
company's top attorney, are at the heart of investigations by the SEC
and by the FBI. Both Global Crossing and Qwest are audited by the
Andersen accounting firm, but each company accounted for the
transactions differently, according to Olofson's letter.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Qwest fell 24 cents to close at $9.36 Monday on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Bermuda-based Global Crossing, which has executive offices in
Beverly Hills, filed for bankruptcy-law protection Jan. 28. Company
executives say Olofson's allegations are false and that the company's
accounting methods are within SEC rules.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing also has booked capacity deals with Level 3
Communications Inc. and 360 Networks, a Canadian communications
company that filed for bankruptcy protection last year. A spokeswoman
for 360 Networks said the company has not received a subpoena from
the SEC and has not been contacted by the FBI. Representatives at
Level 3 did not respond to calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Asia Global Crossing, a sister company to Global Crossing, said it
has not received a subpoena or been contracted by the FBI. However,
the subpoena served on Global Crossing late last week includes a
request for contracts that involve Asia Global Crossing, spokeswoman
Madelyn Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite strenuous denials from Global Crossing, the allegations
surrounding the company, its accounting practices and the financial
dealings of its politically connected executives are prompting
increasing comparisons to the continuing saga at Houston-based Enron
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The energy trader's collapse revealed a quagmire of misleading
accounting and self-dealing within the firm, sparking investigations
by several agencies and Congress, and renewed interest in the
accounting minutiae involving Global Crossing and others.</TE>
<TE>   Like Enron, Global Crossing's corporate trail includes excessive
executive compensation and loans, large stock sales by top officers
before the company's bankruptcy filing and a cozy relationship with
Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of letters to Global Crossing in 2000, SEC officials
peppered the company with questions about the way it accounted for
capacity deals with other companies. The agency also questioned
whether Andersen's independence was "impaired" with the hiring of
Joseph Perrone as Global Crossing's new senior vice president of
finance.</TE>
<TE>   Perrone came to Global Crossing from Andersen, where he had been
the audit partner for Global Crossing since the company's inception.
Ultimately, the SEC was satisfied that Andersen "met the requirements
for independence," according to Global Crossing spokeswoman Becky
Yeamans.</TE>
<TE>   Yeamans described the SEC questions in 2000 as "routine"
correspondence between regulators and a company about to sell stock
to the public.</TE>
<TE>   The inquiries came as Global Crossing prepared to sell tracking
stock in its GlobalCenter Internet hosting subsidiary--a plan that
was aborted--and later, as Asia Global Crossing geared up for its
initial public stock offering.</TE>
<TE>   John Gavin, whose SEC Insight research firm scours SEC
correspondence for relevant data about public companies, said he
doesn't view the Global Crossing-SEC letters in 2000 as routine.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the more extensive probings of a company that we've
seen, and it shows that the SEC was very concerned about Global
Crossing's accounting and disclosure practices," Gavin said.</TE>

<HD>Nortel's CFO Quits Over Trades in His 401(k) Plan</HD>
<DH>Securities: Transactions violated a company policy
prohibiting them during periods around major announcements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nortel Networks' chief financial officer abruptly resigned on Monday,
citing mistakes he made in trading Nortel stock within his 401(k)
retirement plan.</LD>
<LD>   The Canadian telecommunications company said it had voluntarily
submitted data to securities regulators in both the U.S. and Canada
regarding trades made by Terry Hungle, who was named Nortel's chief
financial officer last October.</LD>
<LD>   Hungle, while serving as vice president of finance for a Nortel
subsidiary, transferred about $78,500 from a stock mutual fund that
was primarily invested in Nortel stock to a fixed-income fund on
March 27, 2001, Hungle said in a statement released Monday. After the
market closed that day, the company announced that it would not meet
analysts' earnings expectations, which caused the company's stock
price to plunge 19% the next day.</LD>
<TE>   In December, Hungle transferred about $86,300 back into the stock
fund, effectively reversing his previous trade, he said. Two days
later, Nortel announced that the company's losses would not be as bad
as expected, which caused the stock price to rise.</TE>
<TE>   The trades violated Nortel's internal guidelines prohibiting
executives from buying or selling shares within a set period of time
around major company announcements, the company said. Many companies
have similar "trading windows," which bar executives from making any
transactions involving company stock immediately before or after
major company announcements.</TE>
<TE>   These trading windows are not required by law, Securities and
Exchange Commission officials said Monday. However, they aim to
protect the company and company executives from allegations of
insider trading.</TE>
<TE>   "I now recognize that I made a serious mistake in judgment by
executing the March 27 and Dec. 18 transactions outside the 'window
period' in which the company's senior employees were permitted to
trade in Nortel stock," Hungle said.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of those mistakes in judgment, I am resigning from my
position as chief financial officer."</TE>
<TE>   Hungle's resignation follows a tough period for Nortel, whose
stock has fallen 76% in the last 12 months. It also comes as
investors and regulators are paying close attention to any hint of
corporate impropriety, especially in relation to employee pension
plans.</TE>
<TE>   Nortel, based in suburban Toronto, said Monday that pending the
appointment of a new chief financial officer, Frank Dunn, president
and chief executive, would take on the additional role. Dunn served
as Nortel's chief financial officer until Oct. 31, 2001, when he was
named CEO.</TE>
<TE>   "This matter is unfortunate, but the actions we have taken are in
the best interests of Nortel Networks," Dunn said in a prepared
statement. "Let me emphasize that this matter solely relates to the
personal investment transactions made by Terry Hungle and does not
relate to the business, operations or financials of Nortel Networks."</TE>
<TE>   Nortel refused to comment further. Nortel's stock closed up 55
cents to $6.84 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The news of Hungle's resignation was released after the market
closed. Nortel said a meeting with analysts scheduled for today in
New York would be held as planned.</TE>

<HD>PacifiCare Faces Texas Suit</HD>
<DH>Courts: Attorney general says a subsidiary failed to pay
medical claims of three physicians groups that went bankrupt. Shares
decline 11%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PacifiCare Health Systems Inc.'s turnaround efforts were dealt a
setback Monday when the state of Texas announced a lawsuit against
one of the company's subsidiaries for failing to pay medical care
providers that recently went bankrupt.</LD>
<LD>   Texas Atty. Gen. John Cornyn charged that three physicians groups
in San Antonio, Dallas and Fort Worth  became insolvent, in part,
because of PacifiCare of Texas' failure to pay for legitimate medical
claims and because of its failure to monitor the financial health of
those providers.</LD>
<LD>   "When doctors and hospitals don't get paid as they should--or when
they should--and as a result terminate their relationship with a
health plan, patients suffer the consequences," said Cornyn. "This
problem particularly affects those chronically and acutely ill
patients whose long-term relationship with their doctor is crucial to
their health."</LD>
<TE>   PacifiCare responded by saying that the lawsuit had no merit,
noting that it had "already advanced cash payments on behalf of
members to contracted medical groups to cover the medical services
provided on behalf of its members."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the Santa Ana-based parent company, one of the nation's
largest managed-care companies and the biggest operator of Medicare
health plans, dropped $2.26, or 11%, to close at $18.98 in Nasdaq
trading. The shares have dropped 46% over the last year.  The suit
comes on the heels of an announcement in January that the company was
reducing its work force by 15%, or 3,000 jobs. PacifiCare has an
earnings announcement set for Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit follows months of contentious negotiations between
PacifiCare of Texas and the state. The company was put under state
Department of Insurance oversight when it did not resolve the
payments issue, but it was released from oversight last April. In
October, the company filed its own lawsuit against the state,
challenging its right to investigate whether the company had violated
state laws.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Crawford, an analyst with Fox Pitt Kelton, said that the case
illustrates the precarious situation faced by HMOs that are trying to
adapt to a system in which they no longer control costs through fixed
payments. Many HMOs now are being forced into more of a shared risk
model in which doctors and hospitals are paid more for the care they
provide.</TE>
<TE>   "When those providers go bankrupt, there are lots of
responsibilities that get transferred back to the health plan, like
claims adjudication, and the health plan may not be prepared for
that," Crawford said.</TE>
<TE>   The Texas action is also an example of how states have beefed up
their once toothless "prompt pay" laws demanding that
health-maintenance organizations pay doctors and hospitals for
medical claims on a timely basis. In Georgia, for example, the
state's insurance commissioner recently fined Humana Health Care of
Georgia Inc. $400,000 for violating that state's prompt-pay law.</TE>

<HD>Licensing Problems Threaten PayPal IPO</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>PayPal Inc. warned Monday that its popular online payment service is
about to be shut down in Louisiana by banking regulators, casting
another cloud over the firm's planned initial public stock offering.</LD>
<LD>   PayPal had hoped to sell 5.4 million shares at $12 to $14 apiece
last week, but a patent infringement lawsuit filed by CertCo Inc.
threatened to short-circuit the company's service. That prompted
PayPal to delay the IPO until this week.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Louisiana's claim that PayPal is operating an unlicensed
banking business could force the company to lower its IPO price or
delay the deal, analysts said. But the firm's underwriters said they
still hope to sell the stock Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   In documents filed Monday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Palo Alto-based PayPal said Louisiana regulators sent a
letter Thursday ordering the service to stop brokering payments
between online buyers and sellers until the company receives a money
transmission license. In its SEC filing Monday, PayPal said it will
comply with the order.</TE>
<TE>   Although Louisiana represents less than 1% of PayPal's overall
business, the company's regulatory problems in that state might not
be isolated, management said. New York also has notified PayPal that
the company is running an unlicensed banking business. New York
regulators still haven't ordered PayPal to stop doing business there,
which accounts for 6.4% of the payment volume handled by the company.</TE>
<TE>   The company said regulators in nine other states have indicated it
needs a license to run its online payment service. PayPal said it
already has filed, or plans to file, applications in those states.</TE>

<HD>CalSTRS Buys Apartment and Retail Complex</HD>
<DH>Purchase of the Plaza at the Arboretum in Santa Monica is
one of the largest local residential deals in recent years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California State Teachers' Retirement System has purchased the
Plaza at the Arboretum apartment and retail complex in eastern Santa
Monica's commercial hub in one of the largest local residential deals
in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   The pension fund for the state's public school educators made an
initial payment of nearly $76 million for the 351-unit complex at
2200 Colorado Ave., according to a CalSTRS Investment Committee
report.</LD>
<LD>   The sale also includes a so-called earn-out arrangement that could
boost the price substantially depending on the property's financial
performance in its early years.</LD>
<TE>   CalSTRS bought the Plaza from its developer, a group led by Foster
City, Calif.-based Legacy Partners Residential.</TE>
<TE>   Westside apartment sales specialist Karoline Sauls said that
although tenant demand has softened, property values haven't been
noticeably hurt. That's primarily because investors continue to
pursue Southern California apartment properties, which they consider
more recession-proof than other types of commercial real estate, said
Sauls, a broker at Hendricks &amp; Partners.</TE>
<TE>   Apartment values on the Westside should move up 5% or so this
year, according to investment brokerage Marcus &amp; Millichap. Values
had jumped well over 10% to an average of about $125,000 a unit last
year even as the economy cooled, the brokerage reported.</TE>
<TE>   CalSTRS paid close to $216,000 a unit for the Plaza at the
Arboretum, which opened last summer in what the city calls the
Professional &amp; Entertainment District. As the Plaza fills--it now is
two-thirds occupied--the purchase price might be adjusted upward
depending on its financial performance.</TE>
<TE>   W. Dean Henry, president of Legacy Partners Residential, declined
to describe the pricing formula, and CalSTRS' real estate director
did not respond to phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   The complex, with apartments that rent for $1,655 to $2,890 a
month, was designed by Kaufman Meeks &amp; Partners. It includes five
seven-story buildings linked by ramps to a central parking structure
and ground-floor retail stores.</TE>
<TE>   The complex was projected to cost about $54 million. Henry said
Legacy Partners Residential had substantial cost over-runs and
construction delays but said it is satisfied with the venture's
outcome and will continue to manage and lease the property.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Ann King of Moran &amp; Co. brokered the sale. Heitman Capital
Management is overseeing the investment on CalSTRS' behalf.</TE>

<HD>Savage's Fate Left to Investors</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Qualcomm Inc. shareholders will determine today whether to re-elect
Enron Corp. board member Frank Savage to the telecommunications
giant's board.</LD>
<LD>   Savage, who has served as a Qualcomm director since 1996, faces
opposition from the California Public Employees' Retirement System, a
major Qualcomm shareholder, and the AFL-CIO.</LD>
<LD>   "Mr. Savage has worked diligently for the shareholders of Qualcomm
and intends to continue to serve as one of its directors," said
Savage's attorney, W. Neil Eggleston.</LD>
<TE>   Savage is one of many Enron directors and executives whose roles
in other companies are undergoing scrutiny as the Houston energy
trading company collapses amid federal regulatory and congressional
probes into possible wrongdoing by senior Enron officials.</TE>
<TE>   Two former Enron board members have bowed out of other board
positions, including Wendy Lee Gramm, who resigned last week as a
director with Invesco Funds, and Robert Jaedicke, who last month left
the board of the California Water Services Group.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS, which owns 3.2 million shares of San Diego-based
Qualcomm, said Monday it had cast its votes against Savage. CalPERS
spokeswoman Pat Macht said the Enron imbroglio "raised considerable
questions about the competence of Enron directors."</TE>
<TE>   Savage's duties on four other boards and his role in managing
Enron's bankruptcies also make it "doubtful he would be able to spend
quality time on the Enron board," Macht said.</TE>
<TE>   Savage's candidacy also is opposed by the AFL-CIO, the major union
organization whose members own 3.1 million Enron shares through their
benefits funds. The Washington-based group began lobbying companies
in January to eject Enron officials from their boards.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors can't afford another Enron," said Andrew L. Stern,
president of the Service Employees International Union and a member
of the AFL-CIO. "Qualcomm should show good governance and restore
investor confidence by asking Frank Savage to step down off the
board."</TE>
<TE>   Qualcomm spokeswoman Christine Trimble said Savage "has served
with integrity" on the company's 13-member board. She said Qualcomm
will continue to monitor the situation.</TE>

<HD>Restaurant Group Tightens Security</HD>
<DH>Food: California association will unveil a program to
screen potential employees through credit checks and Department of
Motor Vehicles records.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Restaurant Assn. is unveiling a program today for its
18,000 member restaurants that will screen potential hires by using,
among other things, reports from credit bureaus and the Department of
Motor Vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   The association says the service is aimed at addressing the
industry's long-standing problem with high turnover as well as more
recent concerns about food and water safety since Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   The checks require consent from prospective employees.</LD>
<TE>   Still, analysts expressed concern about the increased use of
pre-employment background checks, saying that prospective workers
with less-than-pristine credit records could be disqualified without
the chance to defend themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Muller, a management professor at the University of
Central Florida in Orlando, said restaurants, service stations and
grocery stores often have been employers of last resort for the
hard-core unemployed, such as ex-felons.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, these guys have already paid their debt to society and are
motivated to turn it around," Muller said. "Where are they going to
go if they can't work as a chef or busboy?"</TE>
<TE>   Kristen Short, a spokeswoman for the association, said job
applicants with spotty records could let prospective employers know
before the background checks, so as to defuse the issue and provide a
complete explanation.</TE>
<TE>   She said members have expressed increasing interest in security
issues since Sept. 11, and she added that many are likely to take
advantage of the new service.</TE>
<TE>   "Owners want to be able to assure customers that, yes, the food is
safe, and that they've done a thorough background check on everyone
to ensure it stays that way," she said.</TE>
<TE>   After the terrorist attacks, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
suggested that restaurants, supermarkets and farms consider criminal
background checks on employees as precautionary measures against
possible tampering with food and water supplies. The FDA did not
mention credit checks.</TE>
<TE>   The CRA program, run in conjunction with AbsoluteBackgrounds.com,
an employee screening firm near Sacramento, will offer association
members a 10% discount on a variety of checks. The fees will range
from $5 to verify Social Security numbers to $18 for criminal
searches, said Steve Pearce, the company's vice president for
marketing.</TE>
<TE>   The association will receive 5% of the revenue generated by its
members.</TE>

<DH>Development: 'Town center' outdoor mall in the high desert
draws big crowds to its stores and restaurants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MORRIS NEWMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Apparently embracing the "town center" design concept that has proven
popular elsewhere in Southern California, Coachella Valley residents
are crowding into the restaurants and theaters of the River, a newly
opened outdoor shopping center. Although upscale Rancho Mirage does
not lack stores, merchants in the $50-million, 240,000-square-foot
mall report serving more customers than they planned for when the
mall opened late last year.</LD>
<LD>   Borders--the first large-format bookstore in the Coachella
Valley--is experiencing heavier-than-expected sales volume since
opening in October, and has hired 45 sales clerks rather than the 30
planned, said General Manager Tawny Raymond. Another tenant, P.F.
Chang's China Bistro, the Scottsdale, Ariz.-based restaurant chain,
is attracting diners in numbers "beyond our expectations," said
operating partner Tom Eads.</LD>
<LD>   The mall's success, according to its developer, Jerry Snyder, is
based on two factors: the appeal of a traditional shopping street and
the spike in the tourist trade after Sept. 11 to places such as the
Coachella Valley that can easily be reached by car.</LD>
<TE>   In the "town center" design scheme, shopping complexes are built
to look like downtown areas or city squares, with outdoor walkways,
plentiful landscaping and street-like arrangements of shops and
restaurants. Town center-style shopping districts have proven
particularly popular in suburban settings that lack traditional
shopping streets or other notable public gathering places. Such
projects have popped up in recent years in Brea, Calabasas, Irvine,
Pasadena, Santa Clarita and Thousand Oaks. Although the Coachella
Valley is rich in attractions and sporting venues, such as golf
resorts, country clubs and tennis centers, the area is lacking in
pedestrian-oriented public places.</TE>
<TE>   "We are filling a social need," Snyder said.</TE>
<TE>   The River, said Eads, quickly established itself as a destination.
"It's the only place in the [Coachella] valley where people can go
with undefined plans, and say, 'we'll figure out what to do when we
get there,'" he said. At least one local resident agreed. The center
is "like nothing else in the valley," said Dr. Joseph P. Durante, a
Rancho Mirage obstetrician. "The outdoor environment has added a lot"
to the area.</TE>
<TE>   If the River has a gimmick, it is water, which has obvious appeal
in a climate with sunshine 350 days a year and temperatures often
soaring into the triple digits. Five acres of the 30-acre site are
covered in water in various displays. A reflecting pool of nearly 2
acres along the front of the shopping center is a startling sight in
the high desert and serves as a sort of billboard. The center's
design by Jerde Partnership of Los Angeles also includes stepped
waterfalls, fountains lined in black river stones and the namesake
"river," studded with artificial rocks, that runs down the major
walkway inside the center.</TE>
<TE>   The River started two years ago when Barry Foster, economic
development director for Rancho Mirage, asked Snyder to submit a
proposal to the city on the property, which had gone undeveloped for
nearly a quarter century. Before Snyder, said Foster, "we had gone
through six or seven developers," none of whom could put together a
project that was acceptable to the city or to retailers.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, retailers were bypassing Rancho Mirage in favor of
newer locations, such as La Quinta, said Snyder. The Los Angeles
developer, who had been a weekend resident of Rancho Mirage for 20
years without building anything in the Coachella Valley, responded
with a proposal for an entertainment center, anchored by a multiplex
cinema and oriented around open courtyards and water features.</TE>
<TE>   Some earlier developers had wanted to build so-called power
centers composed entirely of stand-alone, "big-box" retailers,
surrounded by an asphalt lake of parking. The city refused. "Mr.
Snyder had the vision to create that focal point, a downtown for the
community," said Foster. "I think the city could have easily changed
the direction and settled for something marginal [in quality],
settled for something different, such as a big-box center. But that
was not the wish of the community."</TE>
<TE>   The centrality of Rancho Mirage in the Coachella Valley--the city
is roughly equidistant between Palm Springs to the west and Indio to
the east--gives the center a good location. Foster said the center
would draw its customers from the cities of the Coachella Valley,
many of which are arranged along Highway 111 like a string of beads.
The River's trade area is also a large one, according to Foster. The
Coachella Valley has a full-time population of about 310,000 people,
plus a part-time population (such as owners of second homes) of
140,000. In addition, the area attracts an estimated 3.5 million
visitors annually.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond demographics, the search by vacationers for travel spots
closer to Los Angeles has benefited places such as Rancho Mirage,
said Snyder. "What has really helped is that people don't want to
fly," he said. "The desert is booming because of Sept. 11."</TE>

<KH>THE FALL OF ENRON</KH>
<HD>Financial Troubles Reached Core Trading, Marketing
Operations</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Units that Enron championed to investors also
may have hid losses, say analysts and former employees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS and LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Enron Corp. circled the drain late last year, the Houston company
insisted that its core energy trading and marketing businesses were
still in fine shape.</LD>
<LD>   In reality, interviews and documents show, Enron's crown jewels
may not have been so shiny without the help of fancy accounting and
the infamous off-the-books partnerships.</LD>
<LD>   "Enron was like that old joke: We're losing money on every trade
but we're going to make it up on volume," quipped Cary Wasden, an
energy analyst who began warning about Enron two years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Wasden and others were worried by hints in Enron's murky financial
reports that all was not right in key Enron businesses. Now Enron's
own internal investigation and accounts from former employees of
Enron Energy Services make those misgivings appear prescient.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's energy trading operation, led by its Internet trading
forum called EnronOnline, was the biggest in the world, and to hear
Enron tell it, the best. Its retail arm, Enron Energy Services, sold
electricity, natural gas and energy management services to businesses
in deregulating markets, and was "a tremendous business," Enron's
then-Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, and then-Chairman Kenneth
L. Lay told shareholders in the company's rosy 2000 annual report.</TE>
<TE>   But even these units that were championed to investors were
struggling and perhaps masking hundreds of millions of dollars in
losses through the aggressive use of legitimate accounting techniques
and other, less legitimate means, according to analysts and former
high-level employees.</TE>
<TE>   Managers of Enron's wholesale trading business, which provided
most of the company's revenue in 2000, were not content to merely
bring buyers and sellers together.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Enron played the role of market maker, putting itself on
the other side of each transaction. If you had electricity to sell,
Enron would buy it and resell it to someone else, dealing in
commodities from coal to toilet paper.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Burning Through So Much Money</TE>
<TE>   In that role, Enron needed an enormous amount of cash. But in the
last quarter before it filed for bankruptcy-law protection in early
December, Enron ran through more than $6 billion in cash, Portland,
Ore., energy economist Robert McCullough calculates, based on the
company's public statements.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough and others think the trading business was burning
through so much money because it was struggling to make a profit but
that the pain was partly hidden by Enron's enthusiastic use of an
accounting method known as mark-to-market, which let Enron recognize
the predicted earnings of a deal in the current quarter even if the
contract stretched 20 years or longer.</TE>
<TE>   Although that technique is standard in commodities trading,
problems emerge when there is no liquid market that can establish
with a degree of certainty what future market values will be.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's trading business initially enjoyed healthy trading
profits, but as imitators rushed in to become the next Enron, trading
margins shrank and the company was forced to look for new markets to
dominate.</TE>
<TE>   Although the volumes of power and gas sold continued to rise,
Enron's trading profits began falling in 1998, said Wasden, managing
director of Reed, Wasden &amp; Associates, a merchant bank in Bellevue,
Wash. Enron's trading margins before interest and taxes, one way to
measure profitability, peaked at 5.26% in the first quarter of 1998
but fell to 1.65% in the third quarter of 2001, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron also made operations look better by recording asset sales as
revenue instead of as one-time gains, the more common accounting
treatment, Wasden said. In the second quarter of last year, the
company booked $700 million of asset sales as revenue, Wasden
figured. "Once you factor that out, they were losing money on energy
trading."</TE>
<TE>   Analyst James Chanos was troubled more than a year ago by what he
called the trading operation's "abysmally low" return on capital, a
widely used measurement of profitability. Chanos' New York company,
Kynikos Associates, makes money by "shorting" stock, or betting that
a particular stock is about to decline in price.</TE>
<TE>   Chanos saw a 7% return on capital for trading in 1999, meaning
that for every dollar of outside capital that Enron was using, it was
earning only 7 cents. Chanos also figured that Enron's cost of
capital was more than 7%, "which meant, from an economic cost point
of view, that Enron wasn't really earning any money at all, despite
reporting profits to its shareholders," Chanos testified Wednesday
before a House panel.</TE>
<TE>   The recently released investigation by Enron directors shines a
flashlight into only a small corner of the company's labyrinth of
off-the-books transactions but raises a significant question about
Enron earnings, economist McCullough said. If at least $1 billion, or
about 70%, of Enron's recent earnings were illusory based on the
examination of only a few partnerships, as the report concludes, then
how healthy could the core operations really have been?</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most telling sign is that Enron, after conducting an
auction to unload its energy trading business, ended up giving it
away to UBS Warburg, a unit of Swiss bank UBS, in exchange for a
share of future profits. On Monday, EnronOnline, the once vaunted
online trading unit, became UBS Warburg Energy, virtually ending the
energy giant's involvement in the industry it once dominated.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Enron's massive retail arm, Enron Energy Services, was
not the profit center that it seemed, former managers and executives
say. The unit sold energy under contract and otherwise managed the
energy needs of tens of thousands of retail clients, from the
University of California to J.C. Penney and Carl's Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Next to the wholesale trading arm, EES was touted by management as
having enormous growth potential for the company. That message never
waned, even as the unit's massive customized contracts lost money and
California's energy crisis in early 2001 battered the unit's book of
business--heavily weighted toward California clients, former
employees said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Restructuring Hid Losses, Ex-Worker Says</TE>
<TE>   An e-mail sent by a disgruntled manager to then-Chairman Lay in
August alleged that more than $500 million in EES losses had been
obscured by a restructuring effort. The missive by Margaret Ceconi,
reported last month, was somewhat vague on the bookkeeping but made
it clear that the unit was portrayed as profitable although it was
heavily burdened.</TE>
<TE>   Enron Corp. spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to discuss specifics
of the trading business or retail operation, saying the company
prefers to look ahead. An EES spokeswoman said that "all the facts
are not in [Ceconi's] letter and the facts will come out soon."</TE>
<TE>   Several other former EES managers have since supported Ceconi's
assertions, painting a picture of a company that used legitimate
accounting methods in questionable ways to achieve what many now say
were deceptive ends.</TE>
<TE>   As with Enron's larger trading business, at the heart of the EES
story is aggressive mark-to-market accounting that allowed the
company to book as current earnings massive future profits that might
never materialize, former employees and analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The future profits on Enron's retail energy contracts--some of
which stretched out as long as a decade--were based on the company's
own models. And those were "crystal ball" curves that predicted the
wildly unpredictable, such as exactly when certain states would pass
legislation to deregulate their energy markets, said former EES
executive Glenn Dickson.</TE>
<TE>   "The only reason the contracts were worthwhile was that
mark-to-market," he said. "You were able to take today 10 years'
worth of minimal profit. But once you're into it, if your curves
aren't as good as what you hoped for, your revenue line deteriorates.
You lose money."</TE>
<TE>   And lose money EES did. Unforeseen problems with California
deregulation threw off the models that predicted profits for the
California book of retail customers. The exact amount is unclear, but
Dickson said, "We had a couple hundred million dollars of position
that EES had taken for that regulatory risk, where we predicted one
thing and now it was different."</TE>
<TE>   The unit also was burdened by the types of contracts it was
seeking--large deals custom-tailored to individual industrial and
commercial clients that could take one or two years to close.</TE>
<TE>   By that time, there was a lot at stake to ensure they would be
profitable. Dickson said that sometimes meant changing the variables
of the underlying model to make the deals appear like winners. Those
future profits were then booked even though the likelihood they would
materialize was slim.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An Effort to Clean Up the Bad Deals</TE>
<TE>   By February 2001, new managers at EES--once headed by Thomas E.
White, now secretary of the Army--was taking stock of the mess. They
launched Project Phoenix, an effort to clean up the bad deals and
renegotiate contracts. They temporarily put the brakes on new deals.
When they started again, a more conservative approach meant "no more
pressure to fudge with the curves," Dickson said.</TE>
<TE>   Then the whole risk desk--which modeled the curves and traded in
retail energy--was moved out of EES into Enron Wholesale Services,
the company's touted wholesale trading unit.</TE>
<TE>   Dickson said the reasons for moving the retail trading desk were
legitimate--to do away with redundancies. But it served another
purpose: The bad deals were moved off the EES books while management
was still promoting the unit as highly promising.</TE>
<TE>   "There was definitely a huge side benefit to not show the world
that the early deals were not good," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Others were even harsher in their assessments.</TE>
<TE>   "Within EES there wasn't a person who had any understanding of the
business who didn't know the reason it was being moved was because of
the [California] book of business and our position," said one former
executive. "They told the analysts it was because of synergies. It
wasn't. The reason was ... to cover up these huge losses."</TE>
<TE>   It was all about timing, he said.</TE>
<TE>   EES had not become profitable until the fourth quarter of 2000,
and then it did so largely on the strength of its California retail
business and its trading positions here, the former executive said.
But when California wholesale power prices went through the roof in
the first quarter of 2001, EES suddenly faced "massive losses of well
over $100 million," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, it was clear that Enron's foray into broadband was
tanking. To admit losses in another unit held forth as an engine of
profitability was not an option managers cared to entertain, he said.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the restructuring, Enron restated its second-quarter
2000 results for EES, Securities and Exchange Commission filings
show. Originally, the unit had revenue of $840 million and operating
income of $24 million. After the restatement, revenue was cut in half
to $420 million, but profit almost doubled to $46 million.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting experts say that companies have leeway to restructure
but that doing so is improper if the purpose is to obscure losses and
misrepresent profitability.</TE>
<TE>   Economist McCullough said much remains hidden about the condition
of Enron's businesses: "The fundamental question we all wonder about
is are these people basically con men or did they represent a
combination of recklessness and pride."</TE>

<HD>MetLife Faces Asbestos Claims</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MetLife Inc., the biggest U.S. life insurer, may be facing more than
$625 million in costs related to lawsuits over its alleged failure to
disclose research from the 1920s to 1950s on the health risks of
asbestos, said Colin Devine, a Salomon Smith Barney Inc. analyst.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based company said in its third-quarter filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission it is the defendant in
numerous lawsuits seeking compensatory and punitive damages.</LD>
<LD>   Devine said MetLife received about 100,000 claims over the last
two years. If even a quarter of those claims are settled for as
little as $25,000 a claim, that would mean a total cost of
$625million, he said.</LD>
<TE>   John Calagna, a MetLife spokesman, said MetLife has set aside
reserves and bought reinsurance to protect against potential losses.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of MetLife rose 2 cents to $29.57 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<LD>The Treasury Department sold $16 billion in three-month bills at a

$14 billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 1.81%, down from

Jan. 22, when the bills sold for 1.67% and 1.735%, respectively.</LD>
<LD>   The new discount rates understate the actual return to
investors--1.748% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,956.60, and 1.852% for a six-month bill selling for $9,908.50.</LD>

<LD>Bank of America Corp., which paid $254 million for Banco Liberal,
said in a lawsuit that the sellers inflated the purchase price and
then stole $38 million from the Brazilian bank after transferring
ownership.</LD>
<LD>   In court papers filed in New York, Bank of America also said it's
now exposed to "significant penalties" because the sellers, who were
officers of Banco Liberal, violated Brazilian foreign exchange law.</LD>
<LD>   Bank of America, then known as NationsBank, bought a majority
stake in Banco Liberal in 1998 as part of its effort to expand into
the Brazilian market. When Bank of America first invested in Banco
Liberal, the Brazilian bank was the country's fourth-largest manager
of foreign money.</LD>
<TE>   Bank of America is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive
damages, in addition to $38 million for the alleged embezzlement.</TE>

<LD>A currency trader suspected of defrauding the U.S. branch of Allied
Irish Banks of $750 million received hefty bonuses for his dealing,
the bank said.</LD>
<LD>   The confirmation that John Rusnak got bonuses of $100,000 to
$200,000 a year, on top of his salary of $85,000, came as AIB said
the bank's directors and top management would have to forgo bonuses
until an investigation of the alleged fraud is completed.</LD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>National Golf Properties Inc.'s shares fell 17% after the largest
U.S. golf course owner said it is suspending dividend payments.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Monica-based company's shares fell $1.65 to close at
$8.05 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares are down 62% since
August, when National Golf said the firm that leases most of its 137
courses, American Golf Corp., may be unable to pay its rent because
of a drop in business.</LD>
<LD>   National Golf had been paying a 46-cent-a-share quarterly
dividend. The company said Friday that the dividend was cut to
"increase financial flexibility." Company officials didn't return
phone calls requesting comment.</LD>
<TE>   The company also said it reached "forbearance agreements" with
certain of its lenders regarding the default on a $300-million credit
line. American Golf's violation of a fixed-charge coverage ratio
triggered the default last year.</TE>

<HD>Global Execs Recognize Workers' Loss</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Global Crossing co-chairmen say Chapter 11 filing
was best to 'preserve' firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN and ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A contrite Gary Winnick told Global Crossing Ltd. employees last week
that the beleaguered telecommunications company had no viable
alternative to filing the fifth-largest bankruptcy case in U.S.
history in January, rendering worthless $453 million in stock held by
employees and other investors.</LD>
<LD>   "We recognize that many of you have been hurt by the collapse of
our company's stock," Winnick, Global Crossing's founder and
co-chairman, wrote in a letter Thursday with Lodwrick Cook, the other
co-chairman. "There are no words to explain how deeply we wish there
had been a solution to our current situation that could have been
different.</LD>
<LD>   "But after consulting the best of legal, and financial minds, it
was determined that filing Chapter 11 was the best way to preserve
our wonderful company for a better day ahead."</LD>
<TE>   In a separate letter Friday to Global Crossing's 8,000 employees,
Chief Executive John Legere defended his multimillion-dollar
compensation package and acknowledged rumors of an FBI investigation
of the firm's accounting methods. He added that the company is
seeking additional investors to help lift it out of bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   The letters, which employees said were posted on the company's
internal computer network, offer the first look at the executives'
spin on the events leading to Global Crossing's filing for bankruptcy
protection under the weight of $12.4 billion in debt. Winnick, Legere
and other executives have been tight-lipped since the filing.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing spokesman John Schmidt declined to comment on the
letters.</TE>
<TE>   "We view all communications between management and employees as
confidential," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick founded Global Crossing five years ago with a personal
investment of $15 million. His dream was to build a worldwide
undersea phone network, and he raised $20 billion to finance it. Over
the years, he has cashed out $602 million, using $94 million to buy a
mansion in Beverly Hills and pledging $100 million to charity. The
company is based in Bermuda but has its executive offices in Beverly
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, Winnick struck a sympathetic tone with employees,
who not only lost their investments in Global Crossing stock but also
saw the value of their retirement plans dwindle. He said the
reorganization plan will allow the company to "provide its people
with a means to rebuild their futures."</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's Bankruptcy Court filing "was the first part of a
necessary strategy to make sure our hard work is not in vain,"
Winnick and Cook wrote. "We have full confidence that the proposed
investment by Hutchison Whampoa and SingTech is the first step in a
carefully planned strategy, designed to restore the financial
stability of our company."</TE>
<TE>   Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and Singapore Technologies Telemedia, two
Asian telecommunications powerhouses, have agreed to provide Global
Crossing with a $750-million investment in exchange for a majority
stake of undefined size. The infusion is the key to the firm's
reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   As for the FBI investigation, which has been reported in the
media, Legere's letter neither confirmed nor denied it. "I'll not
speculate on that further," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The company also is under investigation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Legere wrote that he welcomed the chance to
answer allegations of shady accounting practices made by Roy Olofson,
a former vice president of finance who says he was unfairly dismissed
by Global Crossing after he questioned the practices.</TE>
<TE>   Legere wrote that the SEC will find that "there is nothing amiss
with our accounting."</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of Legere's letter addressed his compensation package,
which has been criticized as exorbitant for a company whose finances
turned out to be so precarious. Legere received a $15-million loan in
February 2000 when he joined Asia Global Crossing, of which Global
Crossing owns 59%. The loan was forgiven in October, after Legere
became Global Crossing's chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Legere wrote that the loan was meant to compensate him for giving
up stock and options in Dell Computer Corp., where he was a
high-ranking executive before he joined Asia Global Crossing. The
$15-million payment was never designed to be repaid and was set up as
a loan solely for tax reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Legere wrote that the $1.1-million salary and $3.5-million signing
bonus he received when he joined Global Crossing were considered
reasonable by the company's board of directors, who consulted with
compensation experts and voted to approve the package.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hired by Global Crossing to do a tough job--that is, take a
company that was transitioning from a building phase to an
operational phase all while facing enormous financial challenges in
the company, the industry, and economy," Legere wrote.</TE>

<HD>Congress May Enter UAL Labor Dispute</HD>
<DH>Airlines: Walkout by mechanics could prompt intervention to
keep the No. 2 U.S. carrier flying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>United Airlines' mechanics may reject a new contract today and force
Congress to take the rare step of forcing a settlement to block a
strike that could cripple the nation's second-biggest airline and the
domestic air-travel system.</LD>
<LD>   Union leaders said the 10,600 mechanics might indeed reject the
contract that was proposed by an emergency presidential board. That
would give the sides only a week to find another solution before the
mechanics are free to walk out. Also, 2,200 cleaning and janitorial
workers at United, the main unit of parent company UAL Corp., are
voting on this contract.</LD>
<LD>   "My sentiment tells me they will reject it," Thomas Buffenbarger,
president of the International Assn. of Machinists, told reporters
after a speech to the National Press Club in Washington. "If they
reject the contract, they will vote to strike."</LD>
<TE>   UAL's new chief executive, John Creighton, urged the mechanics to
approve the offer and called the vote "historic, in a way, because
it's a choice between moving forward and stopping in our tracks." In
a recorded message to United's workers, Creighton said, "I'm not
going to kid anyone. This vote is important to the future of this
company."</TE>
<TE>   UAL, which lost $2.1 billion last year because of the weak economy
and the travel slump triggered by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks--a
record loss for a U.S. airline--is still losing about $10 million a
day. Pressure is on the carrier and Creighton to further slash
United's operating expenses until travel rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   A work stoppage at United would be felt worldwide. Based in the
Chicago suburb of Elk Grove Village, United has about 1,650 flights a
day and is also the biggest carrier serving Los Angeles International
Airport, handling 20% of its traffic.</TE>
<TE>   If the mechanics vote against the pact and United and the IAM are
unable to reach a deal, Congress probably would be called upon to
settle the matter to avoid further disrupting the air-travel system.
It's a situation Congress has not faced since the airline industry
was deregulated in 1978, according to Edgar James, general counsel of
the Allied Pilots Assn., the union for the pilots of AMR Corp.'s
American Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   But organized labor abhors the idea of congressional intervention
in the collective-bargaining process, and Buffenbarger said there
would be "hell to pay" if Congress imposes a settlement. He indicated
the mechanics might then do only the minimum work that the contract
requires--which effectively could cause a legal work slowdown that
would disrupt operations.</TE>
<TE>   The mechanics are voting on a contract proposed by an emergency
board President Bush convened to block the mechanics' initial plan to
strike Dec. 20. The board recommended an immediate 37% pay hike for
the mechanics, who haven't had a raise since 1994, to put them on par
with peers at other big carriers.</TE>
<TE>   United reluctantly approved the plan. But many mechanics felt
union negotiators "could do better than what the [emergency board]
proposed," and found the retirement benefits and job-security
provisions inadequate, IAM spokesman Joe Tiberi said. Union leaders
also have insisted that their members get the new contract before
they agree to any wage and work-rule concessions United is seeking
from all of its employees to ride out the travel slump.</TE>
<TE>   The five-year United contract proposed by the emergency board
includes an immediate raise in senior mechanics' wages to $35.14 an
hour from $26.50, with additional increases in the coming years.</TE>
<TE>   The offer "is a very generous contract," Raymond Neidl, an analyst
at ABN Amro in New York, told clients Monday. Noting the prospect
that it may be rejected, he said, "The mechanics, in our opinion,
seem to be on a suicide mission that could take the company down if a
rejection leads to a strike."</TE>
<TE>   Congress has several options. It could vote to simply extend the
"cooling-off" period during which the two sides would keep
negotiating. It could mandate binding arbitration on the airline and
union. Or it could impose the emergency board's proposal. But any
congressional involvement would be problematic: Congress is in recess
starting Thursday, and the strike could start next week.</TE>
<TE>   Results of the vote are expected late tonight or early Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the labor tension, UAL's stock rose 39 cents, to $12.69 a
share, Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two developers bought shopping center sites in Valencia from Newhall
Land &amp; Farming Co. recently as the building of retail properties
continues in response to residential development in the Santa Clarita
Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles office of Jacksonville, Fla.-based Regency Centers
bought 10.9 acres at Valencia Boulevard and Old Road, and Newport
Beach-based Hopkins Real Estate Group bought 7.39 acres at the
northeast corner of Copper Hill Drive and Newhall Ranch Road.</LD>
<LD>   Regency plans to build a 100,000-square-foot center called
Westridge Village that is scheduled to open in summer 2003. It will
be anchored by a 50,000-square-foot Albertson's supermarket, said Mac
Chandler, a vice president at Regency.</LD>
<TE>   Hopkins will build a 70,000-square-foot center called Highridge
Crossing that is slated to open in spring 2003 and is 50% leased,
said Ray Bayat of Grubb &amp; Ellis, who represented Hopkins and Newhall
Land in the land sale along with Mitch Bayat, Bert Abel and John
Cserkuti.</TE>
<TE>   With its latest land purchase, Hopkins is developing four Valencia
shopping centers totaling 220,000 square feet on approximately 24
acres, said Larry Weese, a Hopkins senior vice president. He said the
firm is negotiating to buy land for a fifth Valencia center.</TE>
<TE>   Terms of the Regency purchase, which was negotiated directly
between Chandler of Regency and Robert A. Mayhew of Newhall Land,
were not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins paid $4.2 million for its parcel, Grubb &amp; Ellis said.</TE>

<HD>Internet Dater Convicted of 3 Rapes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After four days of deliberations, a Pasadena jury Monday convicted a
Canoga Park man of raping and assaulting three women he had met over
the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   The jury of six women and six men convicted Daniel Zabuski, a
41-year-old registered sex offender, on six counts ranging from
forced oral copulation to attempted sodomy.</LD>
<LD>   The jurors deadlocked on five counts involving an alleged fourth
victim. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Terry Smerling
declared a mistrial over those counts.</LD>
<TE>   "This case holds the lesson that you really shouldn't trust anyone
you meet over America Online," Deputy Dist. Atty. Amy Suehiro said
after the verdict. The prosecutor described the victims as lonely
women who "didn't use common sense."</TE>
<TE>   Suehiro said she probably will not retry the allegations involving
the fourth woman because Zabuski, a third-strike felon, already faces
150 years to life in prison. His previous convictions for sex
offenses date to 1983.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, a now-retired Pasadena judge caused an uproar when he
dismissed a rape case against Zabuski, saying a prostitute could not
be raped.</TE>
<TE>   Zabuski's latest sex-crime wave began about two years ago, just
weeks after his parole expired for the earlier assaults, Suehiro
said.</TE>
<TE>   One woman met Zabuski in an online chat room for people interested
in dominant and submissive sex, Suehiro said. Zabuski contacted the
other women by "instant messaging" them through America Online after
reading their user profiles.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney, James Barnes, said his client had only consensual
sex with the women, who are in their 20s and 30s. Barnes also said
the women had wanted to engage in sadomasochistic acts with Zabuski.</TE>
<TE>   Zabuski's wife, Debbie, said she believes her husband is only
guilty of infidelity.</TE>
<TE>   Juror Carlton McKinney, a 66-year-old retired engineer who lives
in Eagle Rock, said jurors felt deep pity for the victims, all of
whom met Zabuski alone after computer chats. "They're very mixed-up,
confused people," McKinney said. "We wanted to take up a collection
for them."</TE>
<TE>   Zabuski's sentencing is scheduled for March 11.</TE>

<HD>2 Divers Survive 12 Hours in 57-Degree Ocean Waters</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two divers rescued by a freighter after spending more than 12 hours
in 57-degree water in the Pacific Ocean southwest of San Diego said
wetsuits saved them from drowning.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Harris of San Diego and Robert Doan of El Cajon landed in
the water after their boat capsized about 11 a.m. Sunday. They were
brought north to San Pedro and turned over to the U.S. Coast Guard on
Monday morning by the freighter Nauticus Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   The men were in their 14-foot recreational vessel Sunday when it
developed engine trouble. While they were trying to fix the engine,
the boat was swamped by heavy seas.</LD>
<TE>   Harris told the Coast Guard that the two men had signal equipment,
but that many ships passed them by before they were picked up about
midnight.</TE>
<TE>   Both men were said by a Coast Guard spokesman to have arrived in
San Pedro in good condition, and a few hours later they drove back to
the San Diego area.</TE>
<TE>   Coast Guard spokesman Lance Jones said that in water so chilly,
"you would have hypothermia and die within anywhere from five and
eight hours." He said Harris told him, "It was our wetsuits that kept
us going all the way."</TE>

<HD>Bigger Role Urged for Palmdale Airport</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Mayor says more must be done to attract airlines
and businesses. Master plan is being developed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn called on the city Airport Commission
on Monday to intensify efforts to develop Palmdale Airport into an
important part of Southern California's air transportation system.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn delivered his message on the eve of a commission vote to seek
competitive proposals from consultants to help develop a master plan
to guide development of the Antelope Valley airport for the next 25
years.</LD>
<LD>   The mayor supported the creation of a master plan to attract
commercial aviation to the 17,000-acre Palmdale facility, where there
is none now. He also called on the city airport department to market
Palmdale to airlines.</LD>
<TE>   "It is clear we cannot wait for the airlines and the aviation
industry to come to us," Hahn wrote in a letter to the commission.
"We have to show them how they can profitably operate at [Palmdale]
and we have to do everything possible to attract the necessary
passenger and shipper traffic."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor also asked that any plan for Palmdale include commercial
and industrial development around the airfield, which, he said, would
"serve as a potent prerequisite for new and sustained commercial air
service."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn noted that it has been three decades since the city purchased
the acreage in Palmdale, but the promise of it becoming a major
airport has not materialized. There is one aviation tenant, SR
Technics, which does airplane maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   One commercial airline had shown interest in beginning service at
Palmdale, but that proposal was tabled after national air traffic was
reduced following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, said Nancy Castles,
a spokeswoman for the city airport department.</TE>
<TE>   Development of air service at Palmdale is seen as a way to reduce
the necessity for Los Angeles International Airport to expand beyond
levels acceptable to neighbors.</TE>

<HD>Jones Attacks Riordan's Stand on Education</HD>
<DH>Campaign: The candidates disagree on breaking up the L.A.
district and on who should control schools.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI and MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial hopeful Bill Jones came to the home turf of
the front-runner in the GOP primary Monday, hopping on a rickety
school bus in Woodland Hills to bash the education record of former
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan.</LD>
<LD>   After touting his own school reform plan, Jones criticized Riordan
for opposing the breakup of the Los Angeles Unified School District
and for backing a new school board and superintendent who are trying
to finish the uncompleted Belmont Learning Complex.</LD>
<LD>   "Dick Riordan's hand-picked superintendent and his hand-picked
school board members haven't made a dent in the bureaucratic
nightmare of LAUSD," Jones said outside Reseda High School.</LD>
<TE>   Riordan, who has made a point of literally laughing off Jones'
jabs for months, responded sharply at a campaign stop of his own in
Chinatown.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sick and tired of answering the folklore and the lies of
people in this campaign," Riordan said. "I think people want to hear
about education."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan has already faced an onslaught of negative ads from the
man he is trying to unseat, Democratic Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   At the state Republican convention last weekend, both Jones and
the third GOP candidate in the race, Pacific Palisades businessman
Bill Simon, lit into Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Simon is preparing his own series of television spots lambasting
Riordan and has contributed $1.4 million more to his own campaign
this past week.</TE>
<TE>   Simon and Jones have lagged behind Riordan in raising campaign
cash. Simon, a multimillionaire, has stayed competitive largely by
lending money to his operation.</TE>
<TE>   With Simon in New York at a fund-raiser, Monday was a contrast
between the underfunded and underdog campaign of Secretary of State
Jones and Riordan, also a multimillionaire.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan last month cruised through California in a huge black bus
with a black leather sofa, granite tile floor, mirrored ceiling, DVD
player, VCR and microwave oven--previously used to ferry pop singer
Chaka Khan and basketball star Dennis Rodman.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' standard-issue yellow school bus was nearly 90 minutes late
pulling into the parking lot of the Promenade Mall in Woodland Hills
to pick up the secretary of state and his entourage. One reporter
rode along with the candidate, his wife, three campaign staffers, one
supporter from Thousand Oaks and seven UCLA students who are in the
same fraternity as Jones' nephew.</TE>
<TE>   When he wasn't criticizing Riordan's record on education, Jones
pushed his own school reform proposal, which calls for limiting
school districts to 30,000 students, slimming the state education
bureaucracy and allowing schools to control their curriculum,
construction and budget.</TE>
<TE>   Although Jones calls for less meddling from Sacramento, some of
his proposals could interfere with local control of schools. To hold
districts to 30,000 students would require splitting L.A. Unified
into 24 new districts and overturning a decision by Carson voters
last year to stay with the mammoth district rather than create their
own.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said he could be flexible on the size of districts but that
parents and teachers would agree that smaller means better. "Our
basic premise here is to get the money and the authority to the
school site," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The bus stopped outside Reseda High, where Jones criticized
Riordan for opposing the breakup of the L.A. district after promising
to back it in his first campaign for mayor in 1993. Jones said the
San Fernando Valley, a hotbed of the school breakup movement, has
suffered because of Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick has said his goal as governor would be to 'empower' people,"
Jones said. "Did Dick empower the people of this valley as mayor?
No."</TE>
<TE>   Jones later stopped at the $123-million Belmont Learning Complex,
where construction was halted in 1999 because of fears of methane gas
contamination.</TE>
<TE>   Although the mayor of Los Angeles has no power over the school
district, Jones contended that Riordan is responsible for the
district's current push to finish the school.</TE>
<TE>   "It would seem to me that if they're so focused on getting
something built, they should do it somewhere they know is safe," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   School district officials have said they will open Belmont only if
it can be made safe.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan said Monday that the school board and Supt. Roy Romer, the
former Colorado governor recruited by the former mayor, had "turned
that district around."</TE>
<TE>   "Belmont, I predict, will be open because of the leadership of
these people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On his visit to the Wing Hop Ginseng &amp; Chinese Products store in
Chinatown, Riordan appeared with a group of Asian American
supporters.</TE>
<TE>   To mark the eve of the Chinese New Year, he handed out small red
envelopes to merchants and customers. Under ancient Chinese custom,
the envelopes would contain cash; Riordan's were stuffed with
chocolate money.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan used the occasion to renew his attacks on the governor's
fiscal management.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope Gray Davis considers a tradition of the Chinese New Year,
and that is that you're to pay all your debts before the end of the
year," Riordan said. "But Gray Davis has another idea. He's going to
make future generations pay the debts for his mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan has declined to say how he would close a state budget gap
of more than $10 billion, but he reiterated his support for
consolidating some state agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is the time to start the cutbacks," he said. "Make every
cutback you can, starting today. Get rid of redundant departments."</TE>
<TE>   Roger Salazar, a Davis spokesman, said the governor has an
excellent record on the budget. "He doesn't know what he's talking
about," Salazar said of Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who attended a Chinese New Year celebration Monday in San
Francisco's Chinatown, released two new television commercials for
his reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   One promotes his expansion of a program that provides health
insurance to children whose families can't afford it. The other casts
him as tough on crime--a supporter of gun control and the death
penalty with a slew of endorsements from law enforcement.</TE>

<HD>Judicial Agency Leader Cleared</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A special examiner has cleared the director of California's judicial
watchdog agency of any wrongdoing during the agency's disciplinary
investigation of a Sonoma County judge.</LD>
<LD>   However, the examiner, retired federal judge Charles A. Legge,
said in a 23-page report to the Commission on Judicial Performance
that director Victoria Henley's work on the case "does present the
appearance of impropriety."</LD>
<LD>   Henley had been accused of failing to disclose that her husband
had pending litigation against Superior Court Judge Patricia Gray
while the agency's investigation was underway.</LD>
<TE>   The commission released Legge's report Monday and announced that
it has asked the attorney general's office to take over the
disciplinary investigation of Gray.</TE>
<TE>   The claims against Henley were lodged in October by Los Angeles
lawyer Mark Geragos, who is defending Gray against the commission's
allegations that she unfairly accused a 1995 election opponent of
condoning the actions of child molesters, robbers and those who kill
police. The opponent was a deputy public defender who represented
indigent criminal defendants.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos has demanded that the Gray case be dropped. On Monday, he
denounced Legge's report.</TE>
<TE>   "For an organization charged with making sure judges uphold
ethical standards, this is an abomination," Geragos said. Henley said
she accepted Legge's findings. "I'm gratified the independent
examiner found no conflict of interest, no misconduct on my part and
that my actions did not prejudice the commission or its investigation
in any respect, and that neither my husband nor I obtained or
attempted to obtain personal advantage."</TE>

<HD>5 Held in Puzzling Death of Toddler</HD>
<DH>Crime: Man, four women living with 13 children are indicted
after boy dies of alleged neglect, malnutrition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- Marin County authorities on Monday were trying to
piece together "a complicated puzzle" involving a man and four women
charged in the death of a toddler, a victim of suspected neglect and
severe malnutrition. A dozen other children were removed from the
group's upscale suburban home.</LD>
<LD>   The five suspects are scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday in Marin
County Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   They were arrested Friday when the children, ranging from 8 months
to 16 years old, were taken into custody after the adults were named
in a grand jury indictment.</LD>
<TE>   The adults are Winnfred Wright, 45; Carol Bremner, 44; Mary
Campbell, 37; Deirdre Hart Wilson, 37; and Kali Polk-Matthews, 20.</TE>
<TE>   All were indicted on charges of involuntary manslaughter and child
endangerment. All except Polk-Matthews also were indicted on one
count each of second-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators were called in Nov. 13 after two adults brought the
toddler to Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael.</TE>
<TE>   The 19-month-old boy was later pronounced dead, and sheriff's
deputies were called because of a "lack of information supplied by
the parents," according to a Marin County Sheriff's Department
statement.</TE>
<TE>   After the toddler's death, authorities served multiple search
warrants and seized numerous undisclosed items they said "show a
pattern of ongoing mistreatment of the children," who investigators
say all suffered from varying degrees of malnutrition and neglect.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the children had rickets, a softening of bones caused by
lack of vitamin D or calcium, said Sheriff's Deputy Fred Marziano.</TE>
<TE>   He said none of the women is legally married to Wright, whom he
described as unemployed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely an odd arrangement," Marziano said. "The only way
I can describe it now is as a group of adults cohabitating in one
home and producing children."</TE>
<TE>   Using blood samples and DNA testing, detectives have spent weeks
trying to determine the relationships of the adults and children
living in the home in the upper-middle class community of Marinwood,
20 miles north of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say Wright fathered all 13 children, including the
deceased boy. The mothers varied, but included all four women.</TE>
<TE>   "Due to the lack of cooperation from the adults living in the
home, investigators were faced with piecing together a complicated
puzzle in determining the parents of each of the children," the
Sheriff's Department statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Marziano said the suspects continue to be uncooperative. "Other
than the first day or so after the child's death, they have refused
to talk to us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, a neighbor said the group moved into the rented home
about three years ago and immediately made it clear they preferred to
keep to themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "They seemed a strange lot--they were very private and kept to
themselves and didn't interact much with the rest of the
neighborhood," said Lynne Scofield, who lives a few doors away from
the group's two-story home.</TE>
<TE>   Scofield said she never heard cries or anything out of the
ordinary--even though she saw several children and different women
around the home.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was just a man and two women, and I assumed one was
his wife," she said. "They were such a private family, you stopped
paying any attention to them after a while. They were so rarely out."</TE>
<TE>   The 12 other children were removed from the home by state child
protective services workers and examined by doctors at UC San
Francisco Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Scofield said neighbors are upset about the events.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all in complete shock that they kept babies and so many
children in that house," she said. "This isn't the kind of
neighborhood where these terrible things happen."</TE>

<HD>2 Die in Tijuana Blazes That Destroy 90 Homes; Many Lose
Electric Power</HD>

<LD>In Tijuana, winds kicked up a series of fires Sunday that killed two
people, destroyed 90 homes and dislocated scores of residents before
being contained. Half of the homes were in a humble settlement not
far from the city's main garbage dump.</LD>
<LD>   Maria del Refugio Pena, 22, burned to death after winds caused a
short circuit in a power line connected to her house, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The burned body of Tomas Sanchez Zaragoza, 37, was found in his
house in another part of the city although officials were unable to
immediately give details on the circumstances of his death.</LD>
<TE>   Many of the houses caught fire from wind-carried embers and
flaming debris. The winds knocked down trees and sent signs, banners
and television antennas flying.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-four people were being housed in a city-run shelter,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   About half of Tijuana's 1.3 million residents lost power at least
temporarily as a result of the winds and fires, said Jose Ruiz Rosas,
an official of Baja's Civil Protection agency.</TE>
<TE>   In many of Tijuana's lower-income neighborhoods, homes are densely
packed and built of plywood and other materials that burn easily.</TE>
<TE>   Many homes illegally siphon electricity from power lines. City
officials warned residents Monday that electricity lines should not
hang over the roofs of their homes and urged them not to use power
obtained in that way.</TE>

<HD>20-Year 'Alimony' Proposed for Valley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A panel setting terms for a proposed San Fernando Valley secession
recommended Monday that the new city pay Los Angeles $563 million in
"alimony," spread out over 20 years.</LD>
<LD>   The payments would start at $65.8 million annually and decrease by
5% each year until 2022. They would make Los Angeles financially
whole after a breakup, representing the taxes that Valley residents
had paid in excess of the value of services they received.</LD>
<LD>   The alimony plan by a Local Agency Formation Commission committee
offers Los Angeles far less than the $305 million a year in
perpetuity that the city had sought.</LD>
<TE>   Valley VOTE, the pro-secession group, also did not get all it
wanted. It had urged the committee to impose a 10-year limit on the
payments.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council's top analyst, Ron Deaton, denounced the plan as
"voodoo economics." He said it vastly underestimates the lost Valley
tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The LAFCO panel rejected Deaton's proposal that an independent
Valley pay $285 million annually--in addition to alimony--to maintain
certain centralized services, such as the police dispatch system. Los
Angeles officials say they would not be able to reduce those services
after secession, even if the Valley no longer used them.</TE>
<TE>   Deaton also said the plan by the LAFCO committee fails to account
for $30 million that Los Angeles would lose in taxes on property
transfers.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO Executive Director Larry Calemine, however, said the $30
million would be covered in the $65.8-million payment.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine also said he will recommend that LAFCO require Los
Angeles to provide water, power and sewer service to a Valley city at
the same rates charged to the rest of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   He based his decision on a legal opinion given Monday by County
Counsel Lloyd W. Pellman, who said LAFCO has the authority to cap
post-secession utility rates.</TE>
<TE>   That finding contradicts a legal opinion issued by Los Angeles,
which says the city would retain the right to charge Valley residents
higher rates.</TE>
<TE>   The LAFCO panel delayed action on a proposal that a Valley city
not be required to set up a civil service system similar to that of
Los Angeles. The committee tabled the matter after the heads of two
city labor unions claimed the proposal would reduce worker
protections common in government service.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Mayor James K. Hahn on Monday asked the state
controller's office to conduct reviews of LAFCO financial studies of
Valley cityhood and an independent harbor area. The City Council had
requested the reviews on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn followed the council's lead after Controller Kathleen Connell
said her office could complete the reviews within 45 days. That would
ensure that the secession measures could be on a November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO must decide by April whether the cityhood bids for the
Valley, harbor and Hollywood should go before voters in November.</TE>

<HD>Police Hunt Suspects in Shooting of 8 at Party in North
Hills</HD>
<DH>Violence: Investigators believe gang members are behind the
attack on a birthday celebration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police searched Monday for several gang members believed
responsible for wounding eight teenagers at a North Hills birthday
party.</LD>
<LD>   About 50 youths, some as young as 13, were attending the 15th
birthday celebration for a Bishop Alemany High School student Friday
night when three men entered and opened fire with what witnesses said
were shotguns and an assault weapon.</LD>
<LD>   "They showed up and sprayed the crowd," said Det. Mike Oppelt of
the Los Angeles Police Department. "We believe there were at least
two shooters."</LD>
<TE>   The two most seriously wounded party-goers--a 15-year-old boy and
a 19-year-old man--both were shot in the head. The younger victim, a
freshman at Alemany in Mission Hills, was upgraded Monday from
critical to serious condition. The older victim was in fair
condition. The others were treated and released.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators with the LAPD Asian gang task force were trying
Monday to identify the suspects, but they would not say which gang
they believe may have carried out the attack in the carport of an
apartment in the 15000 block of Nordhoff Street.</TE>
<TE>   Some said the shooting is the latest indication that gang-related
crime is becoming more lethal in some parts of the city, including
the San Fernando Valley. According to LAPD figures, 584 people were
killed citywide over the last year, an increase of about 6% from
2000, when 551 people were slain, and about 37% above the 1999 level.
Generally, about 70% of all homicides are gang-related, police
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In the busiest LAPD division in the Valley, Foothill, there were
35 killings in 2001, up from 24 the year before, because of
gang-related slayings and several multiple homicides. Yet in the
Devonshire division, where Friday night's shooting took place, there
were 15 homicides in 2001, four fewer than the year before.</TE>
<TE>   Many parents of students at Alemany High, where some of the
party-goers attended school, were shocked Monday to learn of the
violence. They said they had chosen the private school to protect
their children, parent board President Lori Lundgren said.</TE>
<TE>   "I usually don't have to worry about things like this, and that's
why this was a surprise," said Lundgren, who has a son in the 11th
grade at Alemany and a daughter who graduated there in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been involved in Alemany for the last six years, and I've
never known any of this ever to have happened ... ," Lundgren said.
"There's never even a fight at Alemany."</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere on campus Monday was somber as some students
attended counseling sessions and others started crying during class,
said William Moussa, a freshman.</TE>
<TE>   "Girls were saying they had nightmares; they kept seeing people
being shot over and over," said another freshman, who declined to
give his name.</TE>
<TE>   He said Friday's party was supposed to celebrate the 15th birthday
of a female Alemany student.</TE>

<HD>Irvine Firms Radiance,  Endologix Will Merge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James S. Granelli</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Medical products maker Radiance Medical Systems Inc. said Monday that
it has agreed to merge with privately held Endologix Inc., a maker of
minimally invasive treatments for vascular diseases, for about $8.4
million in cash and stock.</LD>
<LD>   The companies, both based in Irvine, said Radiance will pay 75
cents in cash and one share of its stock for each of the 11.1 million
Endologix shares it doesn't already own. Radiance holds a 4% stake in
Endologix.</LD>
<LD>   The merged company will take the Endologix name and will be run by
Franklin D. Brown, who took over a year ago as chairman and chief
executive at Endologix. Jeff Thiel, president and chief executive of
money-losing Radiance, will be a director of the merged entity.</LD>
<TE>   Under the deal, Radiance also would pay up to 50 cents a share in
cash or stock, a total of $5.6 million, if Endologix gets regulatory
approval by specified dates for its minimally invasive stent
technology. Radiance stock has dropped 75% in the past year to close
at $1.70 a share Monday, down 3 cents on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The merger is subject to shareholder approval.</TE>

<HD>Suspect's Looking for a New High: a Drug-Dealing Lawyer to
Defend Him</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The February issue of California Lawyer magazine contains some wacky
legal transcripts, including one from Beverly Hills Municipal Court
with a Perry Mason-like twist:</LD>
<LD>   Judge: Do you have money to hire your own lawyer if you desired?</LD>
<LD>   Defendant: No, I don't.</LD>
<TE>   Judge: Do you desire to have a public defender?</TE>
<TE>   Defendant: No, I don't.</TE>
<TE>   Judge: Do you want to represent yourself?</TE>
<TE>   Defendant: No, I will hire the attorney that got me high.</TE>
<TE>   Judge: Say it again?</TE>
<TE>   Defendant: I will hire the attorney that got me high on the drugs
that I was on that night. I think he owes me the courtesy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hold that question: Richard Showstack of Newport Beach saw a
driver who apparently was weary of people asking if he had any Grey
Poupon. The license plate on his Rolls Royce said: NO MSTRD.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not another Florida voting debacle ... Is Secretary of State Bill
Jones, one of the hopefuls for the Republican gubernatorial
nomination, living in the past?</TE>
<TE>   Tim Oder, a government teacher at Fallbrook High, received some
mailers from Jones that indicated that the March 5 primary has
already been held (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's an area for employee breaks: After spotting a "customer
pickup" spot outside a store, Deborah Wolen of Studio City quipped:
"I think I'd opt for home delivery" (see photo). (Could the pickup
area really be inside the fence?)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Well, the Beach Boys weren't into surfing: Brad Polt-Jones, who
lives in downtown L.A. in a converted warehouse-studio saw some young
men with skateboards being photographed and videotaped amid the
industrial digs.</TE>
<TE>   A passerby asked one of the guys if they were making a
skateboarding movie.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, the questioners forgot that this is L.A., the land of
illusion. The subjects were actually rock musicians posing for
promotional shots.</TE>
<TE>   "None of us know how to skate," admitted one of the guys.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Liking the odds: In closing, here is a transcript that California
Lawyer reprinted from the newsletter of the California Judge's Assn:</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor: I'm sitting here, and I looked at the jury. Eleven
women around you.</TE>
<TE>   Prospective male juror: Hey, happy days.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor: We don't know how the jury will be after this right
now. But if you were in a jury such as right now, eleven to one, can
you still work with all eleven of them?</TE>
<TE>   Prospective male juror: Could we be sequestered?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Several readers thought they had caught me in a
spell-check boo-boo in an item about a taxi customer who was arrested
soon after robbing the driver. I said the assailant, who pulled the
job outside his residence, was no "road scholar." Some accused me of
misspelling "Rhodes scholar." Of course, I was making a joke about a
dumb roadside crime. Can't decide whether it's worse to commit a
misspelling or a bad pun.</TE>

<HD>Hospital Clowns Make the Rounds</HD>
<DH>Health care: Whittier facility trains volunteers to cheer
up its patients. Medical experts believe humor is good therapy.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The critical care unit had an outbreak of frowns. So the Whittier
hospital sent in the clowns.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh, so you need your B-12 shot?" bellowed the red-nosed Dr.
Strawbelly as he bounded into patient Jim Walker's room waving a
foot-long "syringe" that looked more like a contractor's caulking gun
than a medical instrument.</LD>
<LD>   "No!" replied Walker, mustering a grin. The 64-year-old Bell
Gardens truck driver was laughing as Nurse Beacuz and Nurse SoSo
squeezed in next to Strawbelly. Like the make-believe doctor, they
also wore goofy costumes and dispensed jokes.</LD>
<TE>   When the going gets glum, they go for the guffaws at Presbyterian
Intercommunity Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Medical experts across the country who believe laughter is good
therapy have for decades asked clowns to cheer up patients.</TE>
<TE>   Humor fights off chronic stress hormones that weaken your body,
said Dr. Lee Berk, an assistant medical professor at UC Irvine who
has studied the subject for a quarter-century. "The more you laugh,
the more you tune up your immune system."</TE>
<TE>   But operators of the 339-bed nonprofit health center have gone a
step further: They've created their own hospital clown school.</TE>
<TE>   Their first 21 clowns graduated last week. On this day, they
fanned out through the hospital, from the emergency room to the
pediatric ward.</TE>
<TE>   The clowns' arrival at the critical care unit caused nurses' heads
to pop out of doorways. "This can't help but help," said Dr. Mukesh
Shah, a real doctor who was on duty. "If the nurses smile, the
patients smile, too."</TE>
<TE>   The hospital's clown school students took 16 hours of training
over eight weeks before graduating to their multicolor wigs,
greasepaint makeup and puffy-pants costumes. Veteran clowns Paul and
Charlene Hammons and Pam Ehlers, all of Whittier, conducted the
classes.</TE>
<TE>   "In a hospital, you have to be sensitive and respect patients'
space and privacy," said Paul Hammons, 52, a manufacturing manager
who portrays Dr. Strawbelly. "You have to avoid the more physical
clown stuff."</TE>
<TE>   There are other rules, too. They must ask permission before
entering patients' rooms because some people are scared of clowns.
Clowns must wash their hands after leaving each room, and they must
be careful not to touch medical gear such as IV tubes and electronic
heart monitors.</TE>
<TE>   That didn't stop Ehlers, a 40-something second-grade teacher, from
joking about the equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "Want to have a seat while we're waiting?" the costumed Ehlers
quipped to fellow clown Alice Pierson, 80, also of Whittier. Pointing
to a potty seat attached to a bedpan, she deadpanned: "That one's not
taken."</TE>
<TE>   The hospital clowns are unpaid volunteers, although several are
also employees of the hospital. Gabriel Valles, 50, is a security
guard there. He was surprised--but delighted--when co-workers failed
to recognize him. His elaborate red, white and blue clown face makeup
had taken more than an hour to apply.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow clown Joe Estrada, a 61-year-old Los Angeles County
probation officer, spent 90 minutes painting on his smiley face. "If
my boss saw me, he'd have a fit," Estrada joked. "But I like doing
this. It's therapeutic."</TE>
<TE>   Identically costumed clowns Joan Overbeck, 77, Marie Moberly, 72,
and Betty Bradley, 77, strolled through the hospital's triage area
and into its emergency room to cheer up 13-month-old Andres Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   The three women enrolled in the clown class after remembering they
had look-alike clown suits left over from a Pico Rivera Women's Club
event.</TE>
<TE>   "No, we're not wearing padding. What you see is what you get,"
Bradley said of the red satin get-ups. The other two roared at the
joke.</TE>
<TE>   "We've known each other 50 years," said Overbeck.</TE>
<TE>   The youngest clown in the hospital class was 11-year-old Anthony
Hernandez of Rosemead.</TE>
<TE>   "Clowning around is harder than I thought it would be," he
confessed as he headed toward patient Arnold Ponce de Leon's room.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony was joined by 71-year-old Roy Holguin, a retired Whittier
tool and die maker who spent $300 on a clown suit of patriotic stars
and stripes.</TE>
<TE>   Ponce de Leon brightened when he received a barrage of jokes and a
handcrafted balloon animal from the clowns.</TE>
<TE>   "It lifted my spirits a lot," said the 69-year-old who was
recuperating from surgery.</TE>

<HD>More Patrols Urged to Curb Crime in Parks</HD>
<DH>Violence: Hahn seeks greater police presence at city's 20
most dangerous green spaces. An LAPD official calls the mayor's plan
inefficient.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn on Monday called on the Police
Department to increase patrols at the city's most dangerous parks,
saying he is alarmed by a recent increase in crime in the community's
green spaces.</LD>
<LD>   "We can't allow our parks to become safe havens for criminals,"
said Hahn, surrounded by residents and other city officials at Silver
Lake's Bellevue Park, a place the mayor called one of the city's most
crime-plagued parks.</LD>
<LD>   A week after announcing he does not support a second term for
Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, the mayor continued to focus on what
he says is the city's rising crime rate.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, Hahn refrained from explicitly criticizing the chief,
but he made it clear that he believes more needs to be done to combat
violence.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to have police officers where the problems are," Hahn
said. "We can't surrender the parks to the criminal element."</TE>
<TE>   But police officials said the LAPD already patrols parks and that
the mayor's proposal would be inefficient.</TE>
<TE>   The debate over park safety reflects the running disagreement
between Hahn and Parks about the city's crime trends.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor cites a 17.3% increase in violent crime over the last
two years as a sign that the city is getting more dangerous, while
Parks notes that violent crime has been lower under his tenure than
during the previous four-year period.</TE>
<TE>   Police Department officials say Hahn is just taking a snapshot of
the actual crime trend.</TE>
<TE>   "It's inaccurate to say today that we have a serious crime problem
in the city of Los Angeles based on the last year of statistics,"
said LAPD Cmdr. Gary Brennan. "You have to look at crime over time."</TE>
<TE>   But Hahn said the numbers show that crime is going up.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, if you average things in and average it over five
years and 10 years, you can make statistics say anything you want,"
the mayor said. "The facts speak for themselves. There's a problem
and a problem that needs to be resolved."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Hahn used the city's parks to draw attention to the
issue, noting that there were 21% more criminal incidents reported to
the park ranger staff in 2001 than the year before. LAPD officials
did not have comparable statistics about the crime rate in parks
immediately available.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor cited several recent shootings as evidence of the need
for a greater police presence in the parks. In November, a
13-year-old boy was shot and killed in the lobby of St. Andrews
Recreation Center in South Los Angeles. In December, suspected gang
members fired into the Wilmington Recreation Center, sending more
than 100 people fleeing for cover.</TE>
<TE>   And last week, staff members at the Jim Gilliam Recreation Center
in South Los Angeles locked themselves inside the building as a
shooting suspect was chased through the park.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn asked the Police Commission to study the idea of creating a
dedicated park police unit within the Police Department, similar to
the transportation unit that patrols the city's buses and subways.
The mayor also asked the City Council to approve an ordinance that
would increase penalties for crimes committed in parks.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the mayor said he wants the LAPD to increase its
patrol of the 20 most dangerous parks in the city.</TE>
<TE>   But Brennan said the LAPD already has a safe parks program, which
coordinates patrol officers, senior lead officers and the unarmed
park rangers who work for the city's Department of Recreation and
Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Under the program, police officers are responsible for the safety
of the parks in the neighborhoods they patrol and work with the park
staff and rangers to combat crime and other problems, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Brennan said the idea of a separate park patrol would take
officers away from other responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frankly an inefficient use of resources and it's not the
best way to do police work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As Hahn announced his proposal, children chased each other across
the grass and residents sipped coffee. But the peaceful morning scene
belied what neighbors say happens in Bellevue Park at dusk.</TE>
<TE>   When night approaches, the small green nook tucked into a hillside
is overrun with gang members drinking beer and smoking marijuana,
according to neighbors and park staff.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a 14-year-old girl was shot and killed in the park.</TE>

<HD>First Lady Applauds LA's BEST</HD>
<DH>Education: Laura Bush praises the after-school program in a
visit to North Hollywood. Students show her a science experiment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an art classroom in North Hollywood with 21 wide-eyed children
Monday, First Lady Laura Bush promoted a local after-school education
program, calling it a model for the nation.</LD>
<LD>   "If you heard President Bush's education bill, he's very
interested in great after-school programs like this one," Bush said
to kindergarten through fifth-grade students and a swarm of media at
Fair Avenue Elementary School.</LD>
<LD>   The program, LA's BEST, was established in 1988 and has expanded
from the initial 10 schools to 101. Proponents say it has
successfully brought art, science, sports and tutoring to thousands
of students ages 5 to 12 in lower-income neighborhoods.</LD>
<TE>   Children who participate in LA's BEST had better attendance,
better grades and scored better on standardized tests, a UCLA study
found.</TE>
<TE>   Fair Avenue Elementary was chosen because its recent standardized
test scores showed great improvement. Ten percent of its 1,800-member
student body is enrolled in the program.</TE>
<TE>   LA's BEST "has really contributed to the academic success of this
school," said Los Angeles Board of Education President Caprice Young.
"This is an impoverished neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   About 45 students enrolled in LA's BEST reenacted a science and
art lesson for Bush on Monday afternoon. Four students demonstrated a
science experiment called the "submarine egg." In a lesson about
buoyancy, the students showed how an egg will float in water if salt
is added.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little nervous," said Gary Bellamy, a third-grader, while
watching the experiment. "I'm glad it floated; otherwise it would
have been embarrassing."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also visited a classroom where letters written by
schoolchildren and addressed to her husband were stapled to the wall.
There, children gave the former public school librarian a toy-sized
model of a vintage sports car and asked her to give it to Jay Leno
when she made an appearance on his talk show later in the day. They
also peppered her with questions and asked her to say hello to the
president on their behalf.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you really live in the White House?" asked first-grader Daniel
Rivas.</TE>
<TE>   Carla Sanger, president of LA's BEST, said Bush's visit further
legitimized LA's BEST as a model after-school program.</TE>
<TE>   "This attention is such an acknowledgment to our staff and
family," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The program, which is run by the city, L.A. Unified and private
contributors on an annual budget of about $12 million, serves 7,500
students citywide. The activities run at the sites Monday through
Friday after school until 6 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Deputies, Gays Leave Troubles in the Past</HD>
<DH>Community: West Hollywood leaders say the Sheriff's
Department has done an about-face since being accused of bias 10
years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>West Hollywood's gay and lesbian community was boiling over with
frustration in 1991. Gov. Pete Wilson had just vetoed a major gay
rights bill, sparking statewide protests. The AIDS epidemic continued
to claim lives.</LD>
<LD>   And when the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department fired a gay
deputy amid cries of discrimination, activists had had enough. So
they lobbied to end the city's contract with the Sheriff's Department
in favor of a police force that might better reflect the population
of 36,000, which was estimated to be one-third gay.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council put the divisive issue on the ballot, and voters
narrowly decided to keep the Sheriff's Department. The close brush
with losing a $9-million contract, the department's largest at the
time, pushed the station to begin efforts to improve its relationship
with gay residents. Ten years later, residents and city officials
said, that relationship has gone from troubled to positive.</LD>
<TE>   Today, several openly gay deputies serve in the station; it is a
presence that was unimaginable a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's been a long, long journey, but the [deputies] are now part
of the community. And the community respects what they do,'' said Ivy
Bottini, co-chairwoman of the Lesbian and Gay Advisory Board, a group
of residents who act as liaisons to the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Change has come not only in the city but in the department's
policies. After his election in 1998, Sheriff Lee Baca added the word
''homophobia'' to his agency's core-values statement. He vowed that
the department would ''stand against racism, sexism, anti-Semitism,
homophobia and bigotry in all its forms.''</TE>
<TE>   ''Law enforcement has to do more to protect human rights and civil
rights,'' Baca said recently.</TE>
<TE>   Things were different 10 years ago. West Hollywood residents said
law enforcement raids on gay bars, mistreatment of homosexuals in
jail and lack of deputy recruitment in the gay community created
animosity among gay and lesbian residents.</TE>
<TE>   ''I think a lot of people felt there was homophobia within the
Sheriff's [Department],'' said Nancy Greenstein, a former West
Hollywood public safety administrator who is UCLA's director of
police community services.</TE>
<TE>   Rodney Scott, who is gay and has lived in West Hollywood for more
than a decade, has seen the station's transformation.</TE>
<TE>   When deputies dealt with gay and lesbian residents 10 years ago,
''they weren't sensitive to sexual orientation issues,'' he said.
''Those were challenges that have pretty much been mitigated.''</TE>
<TE>   Changes in Policy Made</TE>
<TE>   Scott, co-chairman of Christopher Street West, said deputies
''work really well with us'' at the group's annual gay pride parade
on Santa Monica Boulevard, which attracts about 250,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   ''The thing that spurred the change--I think a lot of it--was that
election,'' said Deputy Don Mueller. The November 1992 ballot measure
to form a police department was defeated 53% to 47%.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Greenstein said, she worked to improve the Sheriff's
Department's relationship with gay and lesbian law enforcement
officers and residents. That meant eliminating questions about
applicants' sexual practices from the department's psychological
screenings, implementing cultural awareness training and recruiting
from the gay community. Even before the election was called, West
Hollywood had begun securing changes in department policies. In 1990,
the city won a battle--begun soon after incorporation in 1984--to bar
discrimination in the hiring of gays and lesbians as deputies.</TE>
<TE>   Bias against them was cited by the 1992 Kolts Commission in its
review of the Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   The department was ''a very difficult environment for gays and
lesbians to work in or find employment'' in, according to the
359-page report produced by the commission, which was led by special
counsel James G. Kolts.</TE>
<TE>   The gay community saw the April 1991 termination of gay West
Hollywood Sheriff's Deputy Bruce Boland as a prime example of
discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   The department said he was fired because of erroneous information
in a report he filed that led to a drug suspect being freed. Boland
contended the error was minor and that he was fired because of his
sexual orientation.</TE>
<TE>   The West Hollywood station has made such an about-face that a
plaque with a photo of Boland, who died of AIDS in 1995, now hangs in
the lobby.</TE>
<TE>   And Deputy Mueller, who is gay, heads the station's community
relations effort.</TE>
<TE>   For years, fear of discrimination kept him from pursuing his dream
of becoming a cop. Then in 1990, he left his job as a stockbroker and
went for it. When he was hired and assigned to the Men's Central
Jail, he worked just as hard to hide his sexual orientation.</TE>
<TE>   'I Was Tired of That Fear'</TE>
<TE>   ''I had to make up stories about a fake, imaginary girlfriend,''
Mueller said. ''I had to make up reasons why my friends had to call
first before coming over. I was terrified [that] somebody would see
me when I was 'somewhere questionable.' I was tired of that fear.''</TE>
<TE>   So, two years after being hired and just months after Boland was
exonerated and reinstated, Mueller revealed to his captain that he
was gay. Then he took a 10-day vacation, fearing what the reaction
would be.</TE>
<TE>   While he was gone, he received several supportive phone messages
from co-workers.</TE>
<TE>   One, Mueller remembered, said, '' 'You got guts. You're stupid,
but you have guts.' ''</TE>
<TE>   There were a few uncomfortable stares when he returned to work,
but, as one of only two openly gay deputies in the department then,
Mueller said, he was soon asked to recruit gay and lesbian deputies.</TE>
<TE>   Next, he became the instructor for the department's 90-minute
cultural awareness training for deputies on gay and lesbian issues.</TE>
<TE>   ''I taught them the basics--almost Gay 101--the basics of the gay
and lesbian community,'' Mueller said. That included educating people
about stereotypes, hate crimes, domestic partner violence and
inclusive language, and how to work with a gay or lesbian partner.</TE>
<TE>   West Hollywood station personnel expanded on this by allowing
members of the city's transgender community to conduct an information
session during briefings and inviting gay and lesbian residents to
address newly assigned deputies during their orientation.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the station's Valuing Diversity Plan, which was adopted
by the entire department in January, deputies take turns making a
presentation each month about their race, ethnicity, religion or
sexual orientation.</TE>
<TE>   The station tracks hate crimes and hate incidents, which have the
potential to escalate, said Mueller, who was assigned to West
Hollywood in 1996. He has developed a policy of having gay and
lesbian deputies make follow-up calls to hate crime victims.</TE>
<TE>   ''They identify themselves as a gay or lesbian deputy,'' he said,
''not as part of the investigation, simply to offer support.''</TE>
<TE>   ''Things have changed here,'' said Ken Leffler, operations
lieutenant at the station. Station personnel are on 16 city
commissions, councils or boards, including the Transgender Advisory
Board. ''We address the concerns of the city.''</TE>
<TE>   The West Hollywood station had a brief relapse in the summer of
2000 when its special problems unit conducted a sting operation.
Capt. Lynda Castro said the deputies responded to complaints of lewd
conduct in the men's room of the Pacific Design Center by going
undercover without following proper procedures. Some residents called
it entrapment.</TE>
<TE>   ''It was something that unfortunately happened and we did a number
of things to address it,'' she said.</TE>
<TE>   Two deputies involved were transferred, additional training was
given, a civilian liaison joined the special problems unit, and
several gay and lesbian groups discussed the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Gordon, co-chairman of the Lesbian and Gay Advisory Board,
was part of the discussions and commends Castro for making ''honest
efforts'' to correct past mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   Starting Point for the County</TE>
<TE>   Gordon praised the addition of lesbian and gay staff at the
station. Deputies and other station personnel ''hear the concerns of
the community and are responsive,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Steve Martin said West Hollywood's gay and lesbian
community gets ''specialized services'' that should be extended
countywide. ''If you're really treating people fairly, you do it
across the board,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Prang, one of four openly gay members on the five-seat
council, said the city's improved relationship with gay and lesbian
residents represents a starting point for change countywide.</TE>
<TE>   He is a civilian field deputy for the Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   West Hollywood Councilman John Duran, who represented Boland
during his trial and sued the department for its treatment of inmates
with HIV, is surprised by the station's turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   ''As a former civil rights lawyer who sued the Sheriff's
Department every chance he got, I've seen a drastic change,'' Duran
said. ''They have done exactly what they said they would: They
reformed.''</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>FALLBROOK</DL>
<LD>Residents of this northern San Diego County community returned to the
smoldering ruins of their homes Monday, poking through ashes for
heirlooms lost, mementoes gone forever and precious documents
destroyed.</LD>
<LD>   Many spoke in dazed and tearful tones of the brutal fire that
erupted suddenly Sunday morning and raced like a typhoon of flames
through high brush, avocado groves and million-dollar homes. By day's
end, at least 30 homes were destroyed and hundreds of residents had
been forced to flee.</LD>
<LD>   "We're homeless now," said Alberta Parker, a retired convenience
store owner. "We saw the flames and felt the wind, strong enough to
blow you over."</LD>
<TE>   Fire officials say the blaze also destroyed 10 smaller structures,
two fire engines and numerous private cars.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana winds were blamed for blazes in several locations in
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Around Fallbrook, more than 4,500 acres burned.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so smoky, it was hurting our eyes and throats," said
Beverly Packard, whose home on Santa Margarita Road was gutted. "Now
everything is gone. Everything."</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials said Monday that the fire was 50% contained, helped
by a drop in temperature and wind speed and the round-the-clock
efforts of more than 700 firefighters from throughout Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   No cause for the blaze has been determined, although investigators
are studying whether it began in a canyon near Gavilan Mountain Road
where brush was being burned.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners told harrowing tales of having only a few minutes to
grab some possessions and flee the advancing flames as softball-sized
embers flew through the air. They said the fire made a roaring sound,
like a locomotive.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pitch black [from smoke]," said Sharon Brunner, who fled
with her husband and granddaughters. "There was a wall of fire on
both sides of the road. A voice inside me said, 'Just put your foot
on the accelerator and go.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Brunners rejoiced that their daughter, Kristen, picking
through the ashes of their 4,000-square-foot ranch-style home, was
able to locate her wedding ring. Other neighbors, on similarly
frantic hunts, were not as fortunate.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was going to die," Mary Fogg said of the shock of
seeing her burned-out home.</TE>
<TE>   Fogg said she had to flee without her medicine and her husband's
Purple Heart, awarded after the World War II battle at Guadalcanal.
"We put our whole life into this house," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Burke was able to save his 1954 red MG sports car but was
nearly trapped by the flames that consumed his house.</TE>
<TE>   "I probably dillydallied too much," he said. "But the wind
shifted. Fortunately, the flames flew over my head and suddenly it
was clear."</TE>
<TE>   Eight people, accompanied by three dogs, took refuge for an hour
in a backyard swimming pool as the fire raged over their heads. They
had been ordered into the pool by firefighters circling in a
helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   The group used towels to cover their faces, the only part of their
bodies above the 50-degree water. They stayed in the pool until they
were rescued by San Diego Sheriff's Deputies Dan Perkins and Gary
Crowley and were taken, soot-covered and trembling with cold, to
Fallbrook Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought hypothermia would take us before the smoke would," said
Bob Burton, a retired high school teacher. "I've never been so cold
in my life."</TE>
<TE>   Many residents remembered that it was the sense of bucolic remove
from the madding influences of Southern California that had brought
them to Fallbrook--population 30,000--60 miles north of San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The Fallbrook ideal is the "gentleman farmer" with a small avocado
grove and a corral for horses and other livestock. Many of the
residents fled Sunday with their horses in tow.</TE>
<TE>   The community's isolation--and the winding roads and long
driveways--hampered efforts by firefighters. The fast-moving fire
hopped with a vicious caprice from ridge to ridge. Although
brushfires are not uncommon in the county, Fallbrook had largely been
spared until Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents wondered why no firefighters answered their frantic
calls.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to buy a $4,000 fire hydrant and put in all these
sprinklers and yet not a damn firetruck came down the street," said
Sue Burke.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials said that the constantly shifting winds made it
impossible to surround the fire in its early stages or to get to all
of the threatened homes. High winds also prohibited the use of air
tankers, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   If there are prototypical Fallbrook residents, it may be the
Burkes. They considered moving to the Pacific Northwest when Richard
retired as an aerospace engineer in the Los Angeles area.</TE>
<TE>   Instead they chose Fallbrook and the spectacular view of De Luz
Canyon, the same canyon that exploded in flames, destroying their
home and nearly taking their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife wanted to live in town," said Burke. "I wanted the
country. This was a great compromise."</TE>
<TE>   Even amid tragedy, some residents tried to maintain perspective.
There were no fatalities and only 11 minor injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "This is nothing compared to Danielle van Dam," the 7-year-old
girl who vanished 10 days ago in San Diego, said Parker, who moved to
Fallbrook from Orange County to escape smog, crowded freeways and
earthquakes.</TE>
<TE>   At the Fallbrook Cafe at Mission and Brandon roads, less than a
mile from the heart of the fire, lunchtime patrons talked of
Fallbrook residents bravely rebuilding and starting anew.</TE>
<TE>   "These people were energetic and ambitious enough to afford homes
out there," said David Hadley, a Fallbrook resident of three decades.
"They're not going to pack up and go away now."</TE>
<TE>   And while there was shock, there was also acceptance that the
Southern California upscale, rural lifestyle has risk attached.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't live out there in that wilderness without considering
the fire danger," said Bill Lashbrook, whose home was spared. "It's a
gamble to live in nature."</TE>
<TE>   "There are lots of burnable things here," said Earle Cook. "But
people are resilient."</TE>
<TE>   The Brunner family, which lost everything except their cat, dogs
and family pictures, was already planning the future.</TE>
<TE>   "We were going to start remodeling the master bedroom," said
Sharon Brunner. "Now we've got more of a major remodel."</TE>
<TE>   Among the homes that were damaged but not destroyed was that of
singer Rita Coolidge. The Grammy winner was on tour and had just
performed at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Surveying the damage Monday to her home and avocado grove,
Coolidge said she felt lucky compared to some of her neighbors whose
homes burned to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, Santa Ana winds diminished considerably Monday,
helping firefighters battle a brushfire that swept through a
wilderness area over the weekend, scorching 2,400 acres near Anaheim
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was about 35% contained and no longer spreading, said
Kymbra Fleming, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Fire Authority.
Full containment is expected by 6 p.m. Wednesday, she said.</TE>

<HD>Bradley, Andrews Restored to Office</HD>
<DH>Compton: Charges of misconduct mix with conciliatory
remarks and vows to appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Compton's  political turbulence paused just long enough Monday for
the mayor and council member defeated last year to be sworn back into
office by a city clerk accused in a lawsuit of mishandling the
election.</LD>
<LD>   The ceremony was barely over when City Clerk Charles Davis
defended his role in the election, which was overturned Friday in a
civil verdict that surprised even its victors.</LD>
<LD>   During a news conference held immediately after he conducted the
ceremony that returned Mayor Omar Bradley and City Councilwoman
Melanie Andrews to office, Davis accused them of breaking the law by
meeting with other council allies Sunday night to consider a new city
manager.</LD>
<TE>   And in still another twist, Davis said their alleged candidate for
city manager was said to be Sheriff's Capt. Cecil Rhambo, the
substation commander who had to assign round-the-clock deputies at
City Hall over the weekend to prevent removal of city property or
documents--an allegation made Friday by Bradley backers.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the meeting, Rhambo stood outside the substation and
smiled through a wince. Yes, he said, there was a meeting of Bradley
and four council members at the substation Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   But the meeting was meant to address a legal question: To whom
would authority fall in the absence of the city manager? The current
city manager and his assistant city manager were appointed by ousted
Mayor Eric Perrodin, and considered by Bradley to be illegal, Rhambo
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no interest or intention to become city manager," Rhambo
said, referring to a position that has had limited job security
recently.</TE>
<TE>   Even residents of this city of 93,000 sometimes have trouble
following Compton's roiling politics, but Bradley and Andrews vowed
to bury grudges and restore stability to a municipal government
rocked since June's disputed city election.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley was defeated in June in a city election that he challenged
in a lawsuit against the city of Compton, City Clerk Davis and
Perrodin.</TE>
<TE>   The election handed longtime incumbent Bradley a stunning upset by
Perrodin, a deputy district attorney who campaigned as a reformer. It
also unseated Councilwoman Andrews, an educator and Bradley ally who
was defeated by Leslie Irving.</TE>
<TE>   In her 33-page ruling Friday, Superior Court Judge Judith C.
Chirlin reversed the results of the election and expressed
disappointment at the conduct of all sides in the case and urged more
responsible behavior. Citing fraud by Irving and three relatives,
Chirlin banned Irving from ever holding public office in California.</TE>
<TE>   The judge found no fraud on the part of Perrodin but found the
election was tainted by a technicality--that the candidates were not
listed on the ballot in accordance with state election law.</TE>
<TE>   Asked Monday if he intends to appeal the judge's ruling, Perrodin
replied, "Absolutely."</TE>
<TE>   That legal appeal adds suspense and a lack of finality to this
chapter of Compton's political history.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts, shocked that Chirlin reinstated the incumbents
rather than calling for a new election, said an appeal of the
controversial ruling stood a decent chance. Even the witness, a
political science professor from Ohio, said he was surprised that the
judge relied so heavily on his testimony.</TE>
<TE>   It remained unclear who had been in charge of the city between
Friday's legal ousting of Perrodin and Monday's swearing-in ceremony.
But by Monday, Bradley was clearly in political command.</TE>
<TE>   After he and Andrews were officially returned to their positions,
their supporters cheered as they vowed to mend fences and refrain
from retaliating against political enemies. One of those was City
Clerk Davis, whom Bradley referred to as though he was not across the
counter handing him his paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   "I hold no ill will for Mr. Davis," Bradley told a bank of
reporters and cameras present to document his return to power. "If I
waste one moment trying to pay someone back, then I'm wasting my
time."</TE>
<TE>   And Davis promised to use "the carrot, not the stick" whenever he
could.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the conciliatory tone of the ceremony, accusations of
wrongdoing still seeped into comments by Bradley and Davis, though
the tone was subdued compared with charges that have been lobbed
since last year's election.</TE>
<TE>   After the Bradley and Andrews entourages left the noontime
ceremony, Davis for the first time responded to the judge's ruling
and her characterization of his role in the election as slipshod. The
judge had ruled that at least one dead person and numerous
noncitizens had voted illegally in the election and that Perrodin's
name was put first on the ballot in violation of state law.</TE>
<TE>   Perrodin's name also appeared first on a primary ballot. The judge
said Davis should have listed the candidates in the June 5 election
in random order, rather than using the same order from the primary
ballot. By being listed first, the judge said, Perrodin gained an
improper statistical advantage that won him at least 306 votes,
enough to determine the outcome in the close race.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, an elected city official who has held office for 28 years,
could not resist throwing barbs after defending his handling of the
election. "You show me an election that's perfect," he said, "I'll
show you a fixed race."</TE>
<TE>   He handed out a four-page typed statement, some of which he read,
and included a copy of the state election code, from which he cited
various subsections he believes supported his actions.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing one of the judge's criticisms that Davis had used 1983
guidelines, Davis was asked why he had not kept up with election code
revisions since then.</TE>
<TE>   "I dropped the ball on that, a number of people dropped the ball
on that," he said. But "man, have you seen the size of that book?" he
asked, holding up his right hand to demonstrate its thickness.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said that he hopes Bradley "will act like he did in his
first term, not his second," and promised to look past their previous
differences.</TE>
<TE>   And asked if he would conduct himself differently in the future,
Bradley picked his words carefully. "The only thing I would do
different," he said, "is I would negotiate with far more sugar."</TE>

<CX>   Compton election--A story in Tuesday's California section
incorrectly identified the status of Melanie Andrews when she ran for the
Compton City Council in June 2001. Andrews, who was defeated in that
election, did not run as an incumbent. A judge, citing fraud by Andrews'
opponent, last week declared that Andrews has won the election.</CX>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kansas' bid for an undefeated season in the Big 12 Conference is
alive--barely. All it took was 110 points and clutch three-point
shooting in overtime.</LD>
<LD>   Drew Gooden scored 28 points and Jeff Boschee made two three-point
baskets in overtime, helping the No. 2-ranked Jayhawks defeat Texas,
110-103, Monday night at Austin, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Kansas (22-2, 11-0 in conference) is vying for its first Big 12
regular-season title since 1998.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought we did lose our poise," Kansas Coach Roy Williams said.
"But I think we answered their baskets and challenges."</TE>
<TE>   Texas, which matched Kansas' transition game nearly basket for
basket, gave up 100 points for the first time since a 102-72 defeat
to the Jayhawks in 1997-98.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Mouton had 25 points for Texas (16-8, 7-4).</TE>
<TE>   OTHER GAMES</TE>
<TE>   Caron Butler had 20 points and 11 rebounds, leading Connecticut
(16-6, 8-3) to a 46-40 victory against Villanova (13-9, 4-7) at
Hartford, Conn., in the second-lowest scoring game in Big East
history.... Brian Greene scored six of his 16 points in overtime and
Colorado State (10-13) ended a losing streak at four with a 70-66
victory against Michigan (10-12) at Fort Collins, Colo.... San Diego
State (14-10, 3-6 in the Mountain West) was a 77-73 winner against
Brigham Young (14-8, 4-5) at San Diego, a day after the mother of
Aztec Coach Steve Fisher died in Herrin, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Clancy of USC and Jason Kapono of UCLA are among 20 men's
finalists for the Naismith player of the year award, which will be
presented to the men's and women's winners at Atlanta on April 5....
LyRyan Russell, San Francisco's fifth-year senior point guard, will
be sidelined for the season after an MRI confirmed a torn  knee
ligament. Russell, the West Coast Conference's leader in steals (1.95
a game), was injured in San Francisco's 80-67 victory at Loyola
Marymount on Saturday.</TE>

<LD>   "Mayor Willie Brown claims to be a major fight fan," Ostler wrote.
"I can see him now, greeting Tyson on the steps of city hall,
presenting him the key to the city, having first taken the precaution
of changing the lock.</LD>
<LD>   "Da Mayor could also present Da Chomp with a 49er helmet with
full-face cage. Much mutual guffawing and backslapping would occur.</LD>
<TE>   "For laughs, we could have a panhandler approach Tyson and say, 'I
haven't had a bite in days.'"</TE>

<TE>   Trivia time: Which NFL Europe team has produced two Super
Bowl-winning players?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First and goal: Patrick Reusse of the Minneapolis Star Tribune put
the NFL season to rest with a thought worth considering.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, no rules remain for winning a Super Bowl, not when you
consider this: Fran Tarkenton and Dan Marino couldn't win one, and
Trent Dilfer and Tom Brady have won the past two."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second and goal: Chicago Sun-Times columnist Ron Rapoport, still
shell-shocked by Super Bowl prices, lowered the curtain this way:
"You have to wonder how many of those who have descended into
credit-card-maxout hell consider it money well spent by dawn's early
light the next morning."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No hearts, fewer flowers: With Valentine's Day almost here,
consider some words Dan Le Batard of the Miami Herald penned
recently.</TE>
<TE>   "You can say Dallas Maverick owner Mark Cuban is a meddlesome
buffoon, a money-hurling dork, an ego-inflated rebel, a
fine-collecting irritant, a classless boor, a spoiled rich kid and a
spotlight-seeking fool without getting any argument from me.</TE>
<TE>   "But don't say he's bad for his sport, or sports in general. And
certainly don't say he's bad for his team. And don't say he's a bad
owner, either.</TE>
<TE>   "Because, flaws aside, I love the guy."</TE>
<TE>   Difficult to tell, isn't it?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stretches of imagination: A word of advice from Dallas Morning
News columnist Steve Davis to coaches in wake of the resume scandal
at Notre Dame: "Any job-seeking coach who hasn't rushed over to
Kinko's to clean up any 'stretches' isn't the sharpest cheese on the
plate."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A swing and a miss: Riviera Country Club and San Diego's Torrey
Pines South Course are likely to be rivals when it comes to staging
the U.S. Open golf tournament in 2008.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, Nick Canepa of the San Diego Union-Tribune
suggests history is on San Diego's side.</TE>
<TE>   "When Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first came to our links in 1542, he
probably pulled out a 7-iron, turned to the members of his foursome
and said: 'We can do a U.S. Open here.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The Amsterdam Admirals, with Adam Vinatieri in 1996
and Kurt Warner in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Considering all the frozen water being shown on NBC,
Bernie Lincicome of the Rocky Mountain News suggests a better use for
it.</TE>
<TE>   "Ice was meant to be surrounded by scotch. Two-thirds of the world
agrees with that fundamental law of nature."</TE>

<LD>   What: "Night Train Lane"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Mike Burns</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Eakin Press, Austin, Texas</TE>
<TE>   Price: $16.95</TE>
<TE>   This paperback version of Dick "Night Train" Lane's biography was
published shortly before the Hall of Fame cornerback's death on Jan.
29 at age 73.</TE>
<TE>   Although the obituaries captured the essence of Lane's life and
his greatness as a football player, for those who seek a more
complete look, this readable, 107-page book provides it.</TE>
<TE>   In the foreword, Pat Summerall writes: "I played with him and
against him. He was the best I've ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   In the first chapter, Steve Sabol, the president of NFL films, is
quoted as saying: "Night Train Lane was way ahead of his time. He had
a flair, a sense of bravado. He was the forerunner of Deion Sanders."</TE>
<TE>   Sabol has Lane on his all-time defensive backfield with Willie
Wood, Ronnie Lott and Herb Adderly.</TE>
<TE>   Lane was born on April 16, 1928, in Austin, Texas, and three
months later, he was dumped in a trash bin by his mother, a
prostitute who would later come back into his life. Lane was found by
Ella Lane, who reared him.</TE>
<TE>   Lane played one year of junior college ball, then joined the army
at 19. While playing for an army team he was noticed by a scout for
the Los Angeles Rams, who offered him a tryout.</TE>
<TE>   He made the team and as a rookie in 1952 set an NFL record with 14
interceptions. The record still stands.</TE>
<TE>   Lane got his nickname from Ram teammate Tom Fears. Lane often
stopped by Fears' room when he was listening to Buddy Morrows' song
"Night Train."</TE>
<TE>   At first, Lane didn't like the nickname.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1954, after he was traded to the Chicago Cardinals, he had
a big game against the Washington Redskins and their star running
back, Charlie "Choo Choo" Justice. A headline in a Chicago newspaper
read: "Night Train Derails Choo Choo," and the nickname stuck for
good.</TE>
<TE>   Lane, who went from the Cardinals to the Detroit Lions, retired in
1965.</TE>
<TE>   Lane was living in an assisted-living facility in Austin when he
died.</TE>

<HD>Second Race at Fontana Not Likely, Helton Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The chances of California Speedway getting a second Winston Cup race
are about the same as the possibility of American-built Toyotas or
Nissans appearing in a Winston Cup race.</LD>
<LD>   "Possibly some day, but not right now," Mike Helton, president of
NASCAR, said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think we can handle any more races on our schedule," he
said. "There are good arguments for another race at Fontana that make
a lot of sense, but at the same time we are trying to maintain
loyalty to areas that got us to where we are now."</LD>
<TE>   That would be Martinsville, Va., Bristol, Tenn., and Richmond, the
only tracks still on the schedule that are shorter than one mile. All
host two races a year.</TE>
<TE>   The existing schedule has 36 points races plus two other weekends
of racing from February to November.</TE>
<TE>   "As for an import getting into Winston Cup, we know some are made
in the United States, which would comply with our American-built
regulation, but the hang up is that our cars are normally aspirated,
while theirs are fuel-injected.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, the way we build our Winston Cup cars today, they are
more NASCAR stock cars than manufacturers' stock cars. So, maybe one
of these days, we'll see a Toyota or a Mercedes or a Nissan in our
races."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Four drivers, headed by Kyle Petty, were second day qualifiers for
Thursday's Twin 125 races. Petty's speed of 183.061 mph in a Dodge
Intrepid put him in 27th place. Other late qualifiers included
veteran Mike Skinner, 41st at 181.785; Kirk Shelmerdine, 51st at
178.246; and Norm Benning, 53rd and last at 168.429.</TE>
<TE>   "We're 27th and that's borderline," Petty said. "We really don't
know how anybody stacks up right now. How can you know? They've
changed the rules since last year. You just don't know where
anybody's at."</TE>
<TE>   One thing is certain, rookie Jimmie Johnson and 2001 rookie of the
year Kevin Harvick will start on the front row of Sunday's Daytona
500. They earned their spots as the fastest qualifiers Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Positions 3 through 30 will be made up of the highest finishers in
the Twin 125s. Positions 31-36 will be determined by qualifying
speeds, and 37-42 are provisionals determined by car owner's rank
last season. The 43rd and final spot is reserved for any former
Winston Cup champion who might otherwise have failed to qualify.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Gordon received his fourth driver of the year award from
sponsor Barry Schmoyer, making him the most honored driver since the
award was initiated in 1967. Mario Andretti and Darrell Waltrip had
been three-time recipients.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon will receive an Indian Chief motorcycle as his award.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis 500 winner Helio Castroneves and three other
open-wheel drivers, Sam Hornish Jr. and Scott Sharp of the Indy
Racing League and Danny Lasoski of the World of Outlaws, got in some
high-banked testing for Friday's International Race of Champions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a total learning curve for me, I've never been on
pavement before," said Lasoski, whose sprint car is owned by Tony
Stewart, another IROC entrant. "Ever since I got the invite, Tony has
been really talking it up big. At the end of the year, he and I went
one on one in testing and I whipped him up bad. He says now it's time
to get even."</TE>
<TE>   Al Unser Jr., a driver without a ride for 2002--except for
IROC--also was on hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got some things working, I hope, but nothing definite," said
the two-time Indy champion. Unser lost his IRL ride when Budweiser
dropped its sponsorship of Rick Galles' team.</TE>
<TE>   It was fortunate for IROC to get Castroneves as one of its
drivers. The Brazilian is the only "international" driver in the
12-car field.</TE>

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Wanted: Top Offensive Player</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The off-season to-do list for Mighty Duck General Manager Pierre
Gauthier--should he return--is to find an offensive force.</LD>
<LD>   Numbers don't lie and 255 goal-less power plays say a lot.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks have had more opportunities than any other team in the
league and only the Pittsburgh Penguins rank lower on the power play.
Something is missing in the lineup ... something big.</LD>
<TE>   "There is some skill on the power play, but we don't make the
patient play," Coach Bryan Murray said. "We don't have that person
who seems to want to buy time for us, make the creative play and give
us a chance to score a goal."</TE>
<TE>   The answer is obvious to the players and their coach.</TE>
<TE>   There are so many reasons the Ducks need a big, skilled player,
and the power play ranks high on that list.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks were blanked on three power-play tries in the first
period Sunday, when the game with Dallas was scoreless. One goal
might have changed things considerably.</TE>
<TE>   "We just got out-battled on our power play last night," left wing
Mike Leclerc said. "When we got the puck deep, we got out-battled in
corners and they were able to keep icing [the puck] down."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks have two power-play goals in their last 26
opportunities. There have been similar streaks this season. They
haven't scored a power-play goal in 33 of their 60 games this season.</TE>
<TE>   How much would one power-play goal have meant in those 33 games?
In 14, the Ducks either lost by a goal or were tied.</TE>
<TE>   "The couple of guys who have the ability to score [power-play]
goals on this hockey team are smaller guys," Murray said. "We miss on
the first chance and we have a hard time winning battles. That's a
very obvious thing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks face Calgary Wednesday night. A match-up that may not
send either team gently into the Olympic break.</TE>
<TE>   The two teams had a memorable fight-filled battle on Dec. 8 in
Calgary. They had fewer incidents in a Jan. 19 game, but there was
enough payback fights and chippy play that could make Wednesday's
game interesting should it become a rout.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any special feelings toward them, I really don't,''
said Duck tough guy Kevin Sawyer, who has been suspended twice this
season. "Actually, right now, I'm trying to focus on holding back a
little bit. I don't want to get suspended again."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Familiar teams are atop the seedings for the Southern and City
section playoffs. The Southern Section begins playoffs Thursday, and
the City Section begins Championship Division play Friday.</LD>
<LD>   A division-by-division preview:</LD>
<LD>   CITY SECTION</LD>
<TE>   CHAMPIONSHIP DIVISION</TE>
<TE>   Last season's champion: Harbor City Narbonne.</TE>
<TE>   Seeded teams: 1. Narbonne (21-3), 2. Westchester (17-8), 3.
Chatsworth (19-7), 4. Gardena (21-4).</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse: Palisades (14-11) closed the season with a victory
against Westchester.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Narbonne seems more susceptible than last season, but the
Gauchos have too much depth for City teams to overcome.</TE>
<TE>   SOUTHERN SECTION</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION I-AA</TE>
<TE>   Last season's champion: San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   Seeded teams: 1. Lynwood (24-0), 2. Long Beach Poly (28-0), 3.
Chino Hills Ayala (23-4), 4. Anaheim Esperanza (21-4).</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse: Rialto Eisenhower (23-3) gave Poly one of its closest
games, 48-38, and is on the same side of the bracket.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Lynwood was the I-AAA champion last season, but that
division has been dissolved. Anything less than a Lynwood-Poly final
will be a major disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION I-A</TE>
<TE>   Last season's champion: Fullerton Troy.</TE>
<TE>   Seeded teams: 1. San Clemente (22-3), 2. Westminster (21-4), 3.
Newhall Hart (22-4), 4. San Bernardino (19-4).</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse: Edison (17-8) has a victory against Hart and comes
through San Bernardino's quarter of the bracket.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: San Clemente has been the most consistent team in the
division, and it's a failed season if Tritons don't win the title.</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION II-AA</TE>
<TE>   Last season's champion: Brea Olinda.</TE>
<TE>   Seeded teams: 1. Troy (24-2), 2. Ventura (24-2), 3. Irvine
Woodbridge (24-3), 4. Ventura Buena (17-8).</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse: Alhambra Keppel (23-2) lost to Woodbridge, 43-40, and
is athletic enough to present a challenge for Ventura in
quarterfinal.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The toughest division from top to bottom, 10 of the 27
teams have been ranked in The Times' top 25.</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION II-A</TE>
<TE>   Last season's champion: Artesia.</TE>
<TE>   Seeded teams: 1. Brea Olinda (19-6), 2. Santa Margarita (21-4), 3.
Redondo Union (18-7), 4. Torrance North (20-6).</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse: Santa Ana Mater Dei (20-6) lost three of its last four
games but at one point was very good.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Brea is no shoe-in, but the Ladycats' struggles
offensively are offset by division's best defense. Brea held Lynwood
to its season-low 53 points, and San Clemente to its second-lowest,
49.</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION III-AA</TE>
<TE>   Last season's champion: North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake.</TE>
<TE>   Seeded teams: 1. Artesia (20-5), 2. La Puente Bishop Amat (21-7),
3. Apple Valley (21-4), 4. Newbury Park (22-5).</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse: Rim of the World (21-4) has beaten Newbury Park and
Apple Valley and comes through Newbury Park's quarter of the bracket.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Division got a lot more interesting after Artesia's
Lauren Ervin, a 6-3 center, quit last week.</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION III-A</TE>
<TE>   Last season's champion: None.</TE>
<TE>   Seeded teams: 1. Torrance Bishop Montgomery (20-5), 2. Pasadena
Muir (21-4), 3. Inglewood Morningside (19-7), 4. Fullerton Rosary
(15-13).</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse: Santa Ynez (21-4), in Rosary's quarter of the bracket,
has won 12 in a row. Its last three losses were by a combined nine
points.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Bishop Montgomery has won back-to-back state titles and
shouldn't have any problems winning another section championship.</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION IV-AA</TE>
<TE>   Last season's champion: Oak Park.</TE>
<TE>   Seeded teams: 1. Playa del Rey St. Bernard (16-7), 2. Oak Park
(16-10), 3. Cerritos Valley Christian (20-5), 4. Orange Lutheran
(19-6).</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse: Santa Fe Springs St. Paul (20-7), in Valley
Christian's quarter of the bracket, is an at-large team from the
tough Del Rey League and has one of the division's top players,
Crystal Erwin.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: St. Bernard is the most complete team in the division.</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION IV-A</TE>
<TE>   Last season's champion: Playa del Rey St. Bernard.</TE>
<TE>   Seeded teams: 1. Brentwood (23-1), 2. Cypress Brethren Christian
(21-3), 3. Montclair Prep (16-5), 4. Oaks Christian (18-8).</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse: Capistrano Valley Christian (17-5) isn't as
well-rounded as Cate or Windward, but guard Bethany Thom is capable
of helping her team score an upset, as she did in a 54-50 against
Brethren Christian.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Brentwood is the team to beat. It won its last meeting
against Montclair Prep, 70-54.</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION V-AA</TE>
<TE>   Last season's champion: Montclair Prep.</TE>
<TE>   Seeded teams: 1. Palos Verdes Rolling Hills Prep (18-6), 2. Encino
Holy Martyrs (16-7), 3. Granada Hills Hillcrest Christian (13-9), 4.
Saugus Scott Academy (16-6).</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse: Boron (15-7), which comes through the Scott Academy
quarter of the bracket, could be especially dangerous with homecourt
advantage.</TE>

<HD>Nobody Like Him</HD>
<DH>Jordan Has Given Wizards Respectability, and Is Still
Revered Around the NBA</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Well, it's not like the days when they claimed he could heal the
sick.</LD>
<LD>   Someone actually claimed Michael Jordan did that too, back in his
heyday in the '90s, but it's not like that any more.</LD>
<LD>   He's no longer transcendent, merely ascendant, more human than
legend, as prone to the signature gaffe, such as the breakaway dunk
he blasted off the back rim in the All-Star game, as he once was to
the perfect moment, such as his farewell (we thought) title-winning
shot in 1998, framed perfectly by the photographers, with all those
slack-jawed Jazz fans in the background, transfixed on the ball in
the air, and Jordan in the foreground, right hand frozen in his
follow-through, as if he knew ... which, of course, he did.</LD>
<TE>   This hasn't turned out to be the story that saved the nation or
warmed the hearts of an entire world, but then Jordan never said it
would, that was just some sports writers who needed to take a deep
breath.</TE>
<TE>   Nor has he succumbed to an over-weaning ego, made a fool of
himself, tarnished his legacy or whatever some other writers said he
was going to do.</TE>
<TE>   This is no longer a league/network hype or an issue for a "sports
roundtable," but an actual story. It's not aged Willie Mays cringing
under fly balls in the sun or a Buddha-shaped Muhammad Ali waddling
out to get beaten up by Trevor Berbick.</TE>
<TE>   Going into tonight's game against the Lakers, Jordan's Washington
Wizards are 26-21, on pace for a 45-37 finish, which would be a
26-game improvement.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA record is 36, set by the Spurs in 1997-98 after losing
David Robinson for a season, going 20-66, drafting Tim Duncan, and
rising to 56-26.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the Spurs' 35-game jump in 1989-90, when Robinson
was a rookie, and the Celtics' 32-gamer in 1979-80, when Larry Bird
arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Duncan turned 22 in 1998, Robinson was 24 in 1990 and
Bird was 23 in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, as you may have heard, will turn 39 Sunday, making him the
oldest most valuable player candidate on record.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sure he was going to average 20-plus," said New Jersey Net
Coach Byron Scott, an old foe, last week. "I didn't think he would do
this well and have his team playing as well as they've been playing
so far ...</TE>
<TE>   "One man can change the total attitude and the total makeup of a
team...."</TE>
<TE>   Like the latter-day Ali, Jordan is an evolving focus of adoration.
In his swaggering prime, everyone but the boldest or most foolhardy
shrank from him. New York Knick coach Jeff Van Gundy called him "a
con man," hoping to break his spell over the Knick players. In a
famous on-court snarl-off, Jordan told Philadelphia's ferocious
rookie, Allen Iverson, he had to respect his elders and Iverson told
him where he could go with his complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it was always a lie; they all revered Jordan. If you
were a basketball player, coach or fan, how could you not?</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, it's OK to say it, even--aw, shucks, I love you,
man--if he's in the room.</TE>
<TE>   "That mystique, it don't ever go nowhere," said Iverson at the
All-Star game, sitting alongside Jordan in the interview room. "He's
the guy all of us wanted to be like....</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say he's doing better than I thought he would. I never
thought about judging how well he would do. I knew Michael Jordan
would be Michael Jordan. That's the best in the world. To take
Michael Jordan's shoes and try to fill them, they just wouldn't fit.
There will never be another Michael Jordan. Nowhere near."</TE>
<TE>   Happily then, this Michael Jordan will be around for the rest of
the season, and, he says, next.</TE>
<TE>   In this saga, it ain't over till it's over and sometimes, not even
then.</TE>
<TE>   There Have Been Bad Times ...</TE>
<TE>   A celebrity is a person who works hard all his life to become well
known, then wears dark glasses to avoid being recognized.</TE>
<TE>   Comedian Fred Allen</TE>
<TE>   For good--try fame and an estimated $375-million fortune--or ill,
Jordan has defined and embodied modern-day celebrity, an exalting,
life-devouring process.</TE>
<TE>   There are two of him, the Mike few know, walled off behind a few
faithful retainers, and the Jordan Image, the commercial-penetrating,
product-moving machine that always seems to make the big shot and say
the right thing.</TE>
<TE>   This takes genius beyond mere artistry and charisma. Jordan may
mangle syntax but he has acute antennae. One can't imagine him
misreading a crowd, as Kobe Bryant did in Philadelphia. Jordan, one
suspects, would have sensed this wasn't working right away and, as
long as nothing he cared about was at stake, changed course.</TE>
<TE>   But Being Michael means everyone has an opinion about what he's
doing and sometimes that isn't such fun.</TE>
<TE>   When he announced his latest return, an army of disbelievers
seemed to arise in opposition, not only disapproving but offended.</TE>
<TE>   All of a sudden, his presence on a basketball court wasn't going
to be a reason to get excited. Now he was inconvenient.</TE>
<TE>   "The indulging of an ego run amok," wrote the New York Post's
Wally Matthews.</TE>
<TE>   " ... Bored, restless and unable to exit the stage," wrote the
Boston Globe's Bob Ryan.</TE>
<TE>   " ... Always wants it to be about him," wrote the New York Daily
News' Mike Lupica.</TE>
<TE>   " ... It's a bad team and he's stuck playing with bad players,"
said former teammate Scottie Pippen. "It was a bad decision. Even
though you're on TV every night, nobody wants to watch you. I don't
think they'll be any good by the time he retires."</TE>
<TE>   But attention was never Jordan's problem. He was as famous, gawked
at and pursued as Wizard president as he had ever been as icon of the
Bulls.</TE>
<TE>   One can't resign from celebrity of this magnitude. He was like
Bill Clinton or the Beatles. The problem was that in retirement,
Jordan had everything he didn't like about fame, the loss of privacy,
etc., without the thing he liked best, the ability to walk out on a
stage and unloose the magic one more time.</TE>
<TE>   If he was no longer the boy next door, there's no reason to doubt
his love for what he always called "the game of basketball," which
was so humble that once, after playing in an exhibition in the old
Chicago Stadium during his first retirement, he knelt to the floor
and kissed the glowering Bulls logo.</TE>
<TE>   So he returned once more ... and it was a disaster.</TE>
<TE>   His first game was in Madison Square Garden, with everyone
harkening back to his last return in 1995, shortly after coming back
from a two-year layoff, when, rusty as he was, he scored 55 against
the Knicks and hit Bill Wennington under the hoop on the last
possession for the game-winner.</TE>
<TE>   There was talk about this game--on cable--outdrawing Game 3 of the
Yankee-Diamondback World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Jordan looked old and slow, the Wizards young and
clueless, the Knicks won and viewers tuned out by the tens of
thousands.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess," acknowledged Jordan afterward, striking a
never-before-heard note, "the difference is I'm a little bit older
than I was.... "</TE>
<TE>   Was he wondering how much he had left, or how much help he could
expect?</TE>
<TE>   Let's just hazard a guess: Yes.</TE>
<TE>   A week later in Washington, against the 76ers, he threw a pass to
center Jahidi White, who fanned on it. The ball passed through
White's arms, untouched, and sailed out of bounds.</TE>
<TE>   After 11 games, they were 2-9 and even Richard Hamilton, the most
established of the young Wizards, had lost his starting job for four
games. Jordan, who was supposed to be playing 30 minutes was going 40
and his arthritic left knee was so sore, he would fly back to Chicago
for a second opinion. Old guys get injured more often and heal more
slowly. It's life.</TE>
<TE>   In Cleveland, after the loss that dropped them to 3-10, Jordan
issued an unvarnished critique--"I just think we stink"--and a
warning:</TE>
<TE>   "I can't keep up this pace.... I don't see anybody covering my
back but everybody, I'm sure, expects me to cover theirs. That's
something I'm not going to live too much with."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and back in Chicago, his wife Juanita filed for divorce, the
grocery store tabs got on the case and the Washington Post ran a
story, describing the negotiations between husband and wife before
they were married, when she was threatening to file a paternity suit.</TE>
<TE>   "They were discussing and they were dating," Juanita's former
lawyer, Michael Minton, told the Post. "They were saying, 'We're
emotionally committed to each other.' But this was not exactly like
Ozzie and Harriet."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from that, it wasn't such a bad start to the season.</TE>
<TE>   There Have Been Good Times ...</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, there are bigger dreams. One thing you don't want to do is
wake up too quick.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want to keep dreaming and hope you don't wake up and when
... you do wake up, you surprise everybody and it was well worth the
dream."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan to ESPN's David Aldridge last week</TE>
<TE>   Then everything turned around.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't magic but defense, which is a product of desire and
effort and a specialty of Doug Collins, whom Jordan had hand-picked
as coach, needing someone he was already comfortable with, as always.</TE>
<TE>   Collins, strung like a violin string, had quickly and dramatically
improved two teams, Jordan's Bulls and Grant Hill's Detroit Pistons,
before burning himself and everyone else out. But now he was 53 and,
with Jordan as on-court leader and emotional rudder, the situation
was tailor-made for him.</TE>
<TE>   In their first 11 games, the Wizards gave up 100 points six times.
In the next 36, they've given up 100 only seven.</TE>
<TE>   They won nine in a row, lost Hamilton, went 7-9 without him and
then, after he returned, won five in a row going into the break,
climbing into a tie for No. 5 in the East.</TE>
<TE>   It's not the same old Jordan, not even close. On the other hand,
it's still Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   When he returned from Retirement I in 1995, Orlando's Nick
Anderson, a friend of his, announced "No. 45," which Jordan was then
wearing, "doesn't jump like No. 23."</TE>
<TE>   It was true, Jordan was no longer the sky walker of the '80s. Of
course, he then dropped 38, 40 and 39 on Anderson in the next three
games of the East semifinals. It has never been a good idea to mess
with this guy.</TE>
<TE>   Now, after Retirement II, Jordan doesn't even jump like No. 45,
living like a latter-day Bird or Magic Johnson, on his skill, of
which there is a lot, and his wiles, of which there are many.</TE>
<TE>   "He's lost a step and thank goodness," said Bull Coach and former
teammate Bill Cartwright. "Now, he's halfway normal."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan's moves still leave defenders off balance but he can't get
the same kind of separation. His shooting percentage is a career-low
42.1% (a career 50% shooter, his previous low was 46% in his second
season, which ended early when he broke a foot).</TE>
<TE>   But he's still closer to "extraordinary" than "normal." He still
gets even, as after a particularly embarrassing two-for-10, six-point
night against the Indiana Pacers, when he came back to put up 51 and
45 points in the next two games.</TE>
<TE>   His shooting is turning up (33% in October, 41% in December, 43%
in January, 46% this month), his knee is getting stronger and his
minutes are stretching out (34 in December, 38 in January, 40 this
month).</TE>
<TE>   He isn't overshadowing the young guys--another supposed bugaboo.
He ran fourth in All-Star voting behind Vince Carter, Shaquille
O'Neal and Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, the young guys would be enchanted to have him around.
As the Clippers' Darius Miles said, "He's the reason I play."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and Juanita withdrew her divorce petition. The Jordans are
trying to work it out.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't an ending but right now, it's happy enough. It's not the
pundits' comeback anymore, it's all Jordan's and he's enjoying it.</TE>
<TE>   Picture him and Iverson, a bald, middle-aged man with a little
mustache next to a 26-year-old, corn-rowed, tattoo-emblazoned
representative of the younger generation, wearing a red headband with
"The Answer" on it.</TE>
<TE>   Someone asks Iverson to compare Jordan's game now to Bryant's.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't answer that question if I were you but go ahead,"
rumbles Jordan. "That's an unfair question, really, truly."</TE>
<TE>   "You heard what he said," says Iverson, laughing, refusing to
answer.</TE>
<TE>   "Next," says Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed.</TE>

<HD>No Regrets Playing Potvin</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>King Coach Andy Murray said he had no regrets about using goaltender
Felix Potvin on Friday night, even though Potvin, playing on
consecutive nights for the first time this season, gave up a
season-high six goals as the Phoenix Coyotes overcame a 4-0 deficit
in a 6-5 overtime victory at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   "None at all," Murray said. "The reasons for using him were
justifiable. We can all speculate [in] hindsight, and Felix wasn't as
good as he normally is, but he didn't feel fatigued....</LD>
<LD>   "I have to say, based on the circumstances, if I had to make the
decision again, I'd make the same one. You go on percentages and what
you think, and everything pointed to Felix playing."</LD>
<TE>   Murray used Potvin after saying earlier in the week that he would
probably give the start to backup Jamie Storr if Potvin played
Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   "Felix wants to be in there right now," the coach said. "I'd love
from a professional perspective to give Jamie a chance because he's
worked real hard. The other side of it is, we have identified our No.
1 goalie.... You have a No. 1 guy for a reason. He should be your guy
who plays in these important games, and that's no reflection on Jamie
at all. I think he's been outstanding. But I think you're sending the
wrong message if you're not playing the guy you perceive to be your
No. 1 guy."</TE>
<TE>   Potvin, who made his season-high 10th consecutive start Monday
night against the Dallas Stars, played in the Kings' last 23 games
last season after being traded from the Vancouver Canucks. He wants
to play in every game, he said, but denied lobbying Murray to play
Friday night, as Murray had indicated.</TE>
<TE>   "I never asked," Potvin said. "He came to me [before the game] and
asked me how I felt. I said I was fine and he said, 'Do you want to
play?' and I said, 'Yeah.' You always want to play. You come and ask
me, I'm going to say yes."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lubomir Visnovsky, who played for Slovakia in two Olympic
preliminary-round games over the weekend, was scratched Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the record: Before Friday, the Kings last squandered a 4-0
lead Oct. 11, 2000, when the St. Louis Blues scored four goals in the
third period of a 4-4 tie at Staples Center.</TE>

<HD>Potvin Stops Shooting Stars</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Goalie makes a season-high 32 saves in Kings' 2-1
victory over Dallas before sellout crowd.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Putting their weekend misadventures behind them, Ziggy Palffy and the
Kings boldly resumed their NHL duties Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   Palffy, who touched off an international incident Saturday with
his participation in an Olympic preliminary-round game in Salt Lake
City, scored the winning goal with 6:40 to play and the Kings
defeated the Dallas Stars, 2-1, in front of a sellout crowd of 18,118
at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings, who squandered a four-goal lead in a 6-5 overtime loss
to the Phoenix Coyotes on Friday night, also got a first-period goal
from Adam Deadmarsh and a brilliant performance from goaltender Felix
Potvin.</LD>
<TE>   Potvin, after giving up a season-high six goals in a lackluster
performance against the Coyotes, made a season-high 32 saves, his
shutout bid ending only when center Pierre Turgeon scored on a tip-in
with 36 seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   Palffy was back in the King lineup after spending the weekend in
Utah, where on Saturday he had surprised the Kings by playing for
Slovakia, against their wishes, in a 3-0 loss to Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Less than 24 hours earlier, Palffy had scored three goals at
Phoenix, registering his first hat trick since November 2000, but the
Kings had coughed up a 4-0 second-period lead and suffered a
disheartening lost.</TE>
<TE>   By Monday, Palffy had been forgiven--the Kings blamed Slovak team
executives and not the all-star winger, who sat out his previously
approved Sunday night commitment to his countrymen after the Kings
had expressed their displeasure with his unauthorized Saturday
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   And the loss to the Coyotes, while not forgiven, at least had been
forgotten, King Coach Andy Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   "Every game that comes, whether good things happen in the game or
bad things, I think you move on from that and go into the next game,"
Murray said before Monday night's game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all coaching rhetoric and cliches after you've had a big win
to say, 'We're on the right track,' or, 'This will be the big
turnaround for us.' That only happens based on how you play the games
after that....</TE>
<TE>   "To read anything else into situations, I think you're setting
yourself up. If I was to say, 'This could be an omen for bad things
to happen,' that's probably what would happen. I would prefer to say
it's a one-game affair."</TE>
<TE>   The Palffy situation, he said, was "no distraction at all."</TE>
<TE>   The Stars, though, presented a challenge, even if their
disappointing season had led to the Jan. 25 firing of Coach Ken
Hitchcock. The Stars, 2-3-1 under interim Coach Rick Wilson, a former
King assistant, already had defeated the Kings twice, 2-1 at Dallas
on Oct. 9 and 4-3 at Staples Center on Nov. 15.</TE>
<TE>   "There aren't many holes in their lineup," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   Deadmarsh, who had a career-high four assists against the Coyotes,
found the hole between the legs of Star goaltender Ed Belfour with
3:18 to play in the first period, redirecting a blast from the point
by defenseman Mathieu Schneider to give the Kings a 1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The power-play goal was the Kings' league-leading 51st--they rank
second in the NHL in power-play conversion percentage--and
Deadmarsh's 18th, tied with Palffy for the team lead. The assist was
Schneider's third point in three games since returning to the lineup
after sitting out two games because of a strained left shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, the Kings had killed three penalties thanks to some
brilliant stops by Potvin, one a glove save on a shot from right in
front of the net by Joe Nieuwendyk.</TE>
<TE>   With the teams back at even strength, Potvin made another glove
save, this one on a shot by Jamie Langenbrunner on a two-on-one
breakaway.</TE>
<TE>   Neither team generated many scoring opportunities during the
scoreless second period, when the Kings were limited to only three
shots on goal.</TE>
<TE>   The Stars, who had eight shots in each of the first two periods,
kept the pressure on early in the third but Potvin kept the puck out
of the net.</TE>
<TE>   About three minutes into the period, he made a pad save on a shot
from just outside the crease by Pat Verbeek. About two minutes later,
he used his stick to turn away a shot by Pierre Turgeon after the
Star center had intercepted a clearing pass by defenseman Jaroslav
Modry and skated in alone.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Murray was surprised to be involved in a tight game.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to realize that the way we're going to have to play in
the last 26 games is going to have to be on par with what we did last
year," he said, referring to his team's stirring 13-5-5 stretch run
into the playoffs last spring. "There's no backing off.... We've got
to play as hard as we possibly can."</TE>

<HD>Wizards Aren't Magical to Lakers</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Bryant, Jackson aren't overly excited about
tonight's game, despite presence of Jordan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's just another regular-season game, insist several of the Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   Against just another team.</LD>
<LD>   Led by just another player.</LD>
<TE>   Right, and the Olympic men's downhill is just another day on the
slopes.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to rebound from their last game, a loss at home to the
last-place Chicago Bulls nearly a week ago, and trying to regroup
after the All-Star break, the Lakers are trying to downplay the
playoff-level hype surrounding tonight's game at Staples Center
against Michael Jordan and the Washington Wizards.</TE>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson wouldn't buy into speculation about how
he would react to facing Air Jordan, upon whose wings Jackson and the
Chicago Bulls soared to six NBA titles in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't anticipated any kind of reaction," Jackson said. "I'm
just going into it as coaching a game."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he would "disinvolve" himself from making it into
anything more.</TE>
<TE>   "I anticipate that, before the game, we will see each other,"
Jackson said, "and that will be it.... It will not be Michael versus
Kobe."</TE>
<TE>   How can it not be? Jordan, the master and Kobe Bryant, the
disciple, on the same court, one of the premier superstars of the
20th century having returned to test a superstar of the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   Whoa, whoa, said Bryant, cut the hyperbole.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't mean to kill your buzz," he told reporters. "I know hype
is part of the game, but it's not an individual thing for me. This
game to me just means the Lakers have got to beat the Wizards.</TE>
<TE>   "I got to do what I got to do to get this team going."</TE>
<TE>   It might be different if Shaquille O'Neal was playing tonight. He
is the only player capable of dominating the spotlight even when
Jordan and Bryant are on the floor. But the closest O'Neal will get
to the floor is a courtside seat. He's on the injured list because of
a chronic toe injury.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, at least, concedes this is not just another game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like the student going against the teacher," said
Jordan, referring to Jackson, "Although the teacher is not playing,
he's got a pretty good student [Bryant] there who can illustrate his
teachings. I look forward to that.... There will be a lot of emotions
in the game.... I am pretty sure we are both looking forward to the
challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia Mayor John Street called Bryant on Monday morning to
apologize for the fans who booed Bryant in Sunday's All-Star game at
First Union Center.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me," said Bryant, a Philadelphia native, "those people
don't speak for Philadelphia."</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   vs. Washington, 7:30</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net</TE>
<TE>   Site--Staples Center</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KLAC (570)</TE>
<TE>   Records--Lakers 33-13, Wizards 26-21</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Wizards--(2000-01) 2-0</TE>
<TE>   Update--It has been a decade since the Lakers lost a home game to
Washington. The last time it happened, the Great Western Forum was
home to the Lakers, Chicago was home to Jordan and Bullets was the
team name of the Washington franchise. The Wizards went into the
All-Star break with a five-game winning streak. Jordan is averaging
25.1 points, 5.3 assists and 1.48 steals, all team highs. His total
of 286 rebounds is second only to the 368 by Popeye Jones.</TE>

<HD>Time to Meet Better Half</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Lakers are in familiar position of having
to turn their game up a notch after All-Star break.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Turns out, peace, harmony and cute nicknames mean nothing to their
regular season.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers, twice-defending NBA champions, still can't be bothered
by the 82 exhibition games that drag them through the league's
unworthy, as they view the other 28. It would be arrogance, if they
cared enough. Instead, it is indifference, raging. An Olympian
apathy.</LD>
<LD>   A year ago, when the organization burned and a talk-show host
actually got Coach Phil Jackson to bite on the Shaq-or-Kobe question,
among other frailties, the Lakers only needed to resolve the
Shaq-and-Kobe conundrum to become great, consistently. Or so the
theories went.</LD>
<TE>   Now, they hug. One calls the other "Fire," and the other answers
to "Ice." Two weeks ago, Shaquille O'Neal led a six-man Laker
contingent through slate-roofed neighborhoods all the way into
Ardmore, Pa., to watch Kobe Bryant have his high school number
retired. Last January, they could have held the ceremony at O'Neal's
house and served Krispy Kremes afterward, and he wouldn't have
attended.</TE>
<TE>   But that we knew.</TE>
<TE>   The interesting part is that they decided to like each other, to
play for each other, to never roll their eyes at the other, and still
the regular season is a treacherous place. In a curiously
inconsistent first half, the Lakers took their newfound chemistry,
lived with it for a while, and then turned themselves into exactly
the same team. Though capable of brilliance (see the Shaq-less
victory in San Antonio), they are uninterested for days, even weeks,
at a time.</TE>
<TE>   So today they re-enter the regular season after five days off,
against Michael Jordan and the Wizards, just the kind of team they
would have lost to had Jordan not come along and transformed it into
a playoff contender.</TE>
<TE>   They still could fall, for they won't have O'Neal. But if the
Lakers and those who watch them learned nothing else from last
season, it is that humiliation in February means nothing to them in
May.</TE>
<TE>   "Just playing the game together, getting better together, that's
all," Bryant said. "It's a process, is all.</TE>
<TE>   "We're more comfortable with where we are this year than we were
last year. You know what I'm saying? We're playing OK. We could be
playing much better. And we will. But this is where we are right now
and we can only go up."</TE>
<TE>   The other truth: If O'Neal is hale, happy and motivated, the
Lakers can be 15-1 in the playoffs and make their final commute to
Staples Center on the top decks of a few convertible buses.</TE>
<TE>   If that is their course, then Dr. Robert Mohr will be this
season's Eddie Palubinskas, the odd little Aussie who cured O'Neal's
Knoblauchian free-throw syndrome, thereby returning O'Neal's game to
its previous, fearless tenor in time for the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Mohr is the UCLA podiatrist whose duty is O'Neal's arthritic big
toe, sore for months, and the reason O'Neal is on the injured list
for the second time in six weeks. On Mohr's watch, the plan is to
alter O'Neal's shoe and its insert, then become progressively more
aggressive, if necessary. Surgery is an option, though probably not
until after the season.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers expect O'Neal to sit out at least a handful of games in
the second half, which means more Bryant, who averaged 30.2 points
and 25.0 shots in the nine games O'Neal missed before the break, and
more "Superfriends."</TE>
<TE>   "Even though Shaq's not 100% healthy and he's not active enough,
we can still use his strength and his ability for the best of this
team in shorter minutes ... and get by on experience, on our moxie,"
Jackson said. "We have to keep perspective of the overall season and
what we're going to be like in March, which is a grinding month for
us. We're going to have to be prepared to make it through a couple of
real tough months and then get into the playoffs in the best order we
can. If this helps him get through it, if this is one of the things
that makes his toe not symptomatic then he has to get after it."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, O'Neal's off-and-on availability appears to have fouled
Jackson's feel for his rotation. The Lakers often play poorly when
transitioning to or from O'Neal, in part because O'Neal's absence
makes them dependent on either the triangle offense or Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   So they watch Bryant go and they jack three-point shots and they
wonder when O'Neal will be back.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes," forward Rick Fox said, "we create our own challenges
by the way we choose to approach a game."</TE>
<TE>   It is the attitude that produced six losses to last-place teams,
the woeful Chicago Bulls twice. They lost four of the nine games they
played without O'Neal, who served a three-game suspension for the
punch that grazed Brad Miller's left ear, and will play the next four
without him as well.</TE>
<TE>   Though they rank near the top of the league in most of the
important offensive and defensive categories, the Lakers often don't
play like it, which makes Jackson cross his legs and grin thinly.
Sometimes they wear on his legendary patience, and all he really
demands is that they land in mid-April with O'Neal decently fit and
pointed in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   Said Fox: "Shaq always sets the tone."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson reminded everyone on their way to the All-Star break that
championships aren't to be had in February. A few days before,
however, Sacramento King center Vlade Divac warned, "If [the Lakers]
don't have the home-court advantage this year, they're not going to
win it."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings lead the Lakers in the Pacific Division by 21/2 games.
They have only one fewer loss, however, and the coming months have
belonged to the Lakers for two years running. Fox said that the first
half often falls to the individuals, those early months being the
time to score points, sell shoes and, as it turns out, tweak
Jackson's serenity.</TE>
<TE>   "Right around the corner, before you blink an eye, we'll be
playing for the real marbles," Fox said. "Then, the talk turns to
who's going to be playing for the trophy."</TE>

<LD>Utah Jazz guard DeShawn Stevenson was sentenced Monday to two years'
probation for having sex with a minor.</LD>
<LD>   Stevenson was not present for the hearing at Fresno, but his
lawyer, Roger Litman, pleaded no contest on his behalf to charges
that Stevenson, 20, had sex with a 14-year-old girl in June.</LD>
<LD>   Litman pleaded guilty on Stevenson's behalf to a charge of
disturbing the peace for a fight at a basketball game the night he
was drafted by the Jazz out of Fresno's Washington Union High in the
first round in 2000.</LD>

and man," Stevenson said in a statement. "It has given me a new
respect and appreciation for the opportunities I have been blessed
with in my life and career."</TE>
<TE>   California law allows lawyers to enter guilty pleas to
misdemeanors on behalf of their clients. Under the deal, Stevenson
will serve no jail time but must complete 100 hours of community
service and pay $1,100 in fines.</TE>
<TE>   Litman said the Jazz would arrange for Stevenson to do his
community service at the Boys &amp; Girls Club. Prosecutor Brian Andritch
objected to that idea, saying Stevenson should not work around
children because of the case's circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Dale Ikeda clarified that Stevenson could
complete the service at a club for boys only.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jazz reserve center Greg Ostertag was suspended for one game after
bumping Coach Jerry Sloan during a game last week.</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz signed Rusty LaRue to a second 10-day contract.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stephon Marbury apologized for his drunken driving arrest and said
he hoped it wouldn't lead to him being traded from the Phoenix Suns.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a terrible mistake. I feel really bad. I'm sorry for what
happened and I feel horrible about the situation," Marbury said.</TE>
<TE>   Marbury was arrested Friday at Scottsdale, Ariz., after a police
officer said he saw the player's car speeding and weaving on the
road.</TE>

<HD>Colorado Leaves Bruins in Daze</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boston Coach Robbie Ftorek said the Colorado players "were just
everywhere on the ice."</LD>
<LD>   Bruin defenseman Sean O'Donnell said "it felt like they had six or
seven guys out there."</LD>
<LD>   Joe Sakic, Rob Blake and rookie Radim Vrbata each had a goal and
an assist, and the Colorado Avalanche ended a four-game losing streak
at home, defeating the Bruins, 5-2, Monday night.</LD>
<TE>   With one game remaining before the Olympic break, first-place
Colorado extended its lead to seven points over Edmonton in the
Northwest Division.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to finish these games [before the break] and focus,"
Sakic said. "We have been pretty frustrated with the way that things
were going, and tonight was a very good game. Everybody skated and we
did a better job in the neutral zone and forechecked and kept the
puck out of our end."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins, down 3-0, got two goals in the second period to pull
within 3-2 and had a chance to tie the score, but Adam Foote made a
lunging deflection with his stick to keep Bill Guerin from scoring.</TE>
<TE>   Less than two minutes later, Vrbata scored on a rebound.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why you put your stick on the ice, that's why you put your
stick in the lane," Ftorek said. "We weren't as prepared as we needed
to be."</TE>
<TE>   Blake, Stephane Yelle and Sakic scored first-period goals and
Colorado outshot Boston, 10-3.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Roy made 16 saves for the Avalanche. Backup John Grahame
stopped 20 shots for the Bruins, who were 5-0-1 in their previous six
games.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 3, Tampa Bay 1--Sergei Gonchar and Adam Oates scored 19
seconds apart in the second period at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The Capitals finished their four-game stretch between the All-Star
and Olympic breaks by gaining seven of a possible eight points,
building momentum in their drive for a playoff berth.</TE>
<TE>   Washington is 12-1-1 in its last 14 games against Tampa Bay, which
got a goal from Zdeno Ciger.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 3, Montreal 2--Brendan Shanahan scored with 13.2 seconds
left in the third period, lifting the Red Wings at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Shanahan recovered a rebound in the corner and banked a shot off
goalie Jose Theodore from the right corner for his 30th goal this
season and 496th of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Sergei Fedorov scored twice for the Red Wings, who got captain
Steve Yzerman back in the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Yzerman sat out six games following knee surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 5, Atlanta 4--Tomas Kaberle scored twice at Toronto,
including the go-ahead goal with 4:27 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Kaberle tied the score, 1-1, at 10:29 of the first period.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Roberts, Jonas Hoglund and Mats Sundin also scored for the
Maple Leafs, who rallied from 3-1 and 4-3 deficits.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colorado acquired forward Mike Keane from the St. Louis Blues in
exchange for forward Shjon Podein.</TE>
<TE>   Keane, 34, earned one of his three Stanley Cup rings with the
Avalanche in 1995-96. He has four goals and six assists this season.</TE>
<TE>   Podein, 33, has six goals and six assists. He sat out the last
eight games because of a knee injury.</TE>

<KH>Lonnie White ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>Time of the Year for Coaches to Watch Their Back</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the NHL's Winter Olympic Games break two days away, expect
struggling teams to take a closer look at their coaching before play
resumes Feb. 26.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to the success New Jersey General Manager Lou Lamoriello
had two years ago when he fired Robbie Ftorek late in the season and
the Devils responded by winning the Stanley Cup under Larry Robinson,
it has become more acceptable for GMs to make 11th-hour coaching
changes.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't a surprise when Pittsburgh got rid of Ivan Hlinka and
Florida canned Duane Sutter earlier in the season, but eyebrows were
raised after Ken Hitchcock and Robinson, coaches who have won two of
the last three Stanley Cups, were fired last month.</LD>
<TE>   Dallas terminated Hitchcock after his players seemed to tune him
out for good and Robinson was let go by Lamoriello for almost the
same reason.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the focus is that if a coach has been there for a couple
of years and for whatever reason, the team is not playing to
expectations of the owner or the general manager ... " said Mighty
Duck Coach Bryan Murray, the sixth winningest coach in NHL history.
"The coach is blamed rather than have the players read a riot act."</TE>
<TE>   Word around the league has Washington's Ron Wilson as the coach
most likely to get the boot next.</TE>
<TE>   Washington General Manager George McPhee and owner Ted Leonsis
have stuck behind Wilson all season but they can't be pleased with
the Capitals' play this season. Despite adding Jaromir Jagr during
the off-season to go along with sniper Peter Bondra and goaltender
Olaf Kolzig, Washington is fading fast in the Eastern Conference
playoff race.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina has a comfortable lead over the Capitals in the Southeast
Division and Wilson is starting to feel the heat.</TE>
<TE>   "All the things that become a loser's mentality is us right now,"
Wilson said earlier this month. "If the players want to slough off
all the responsibility on me, I'll take it. But you're a professional
athlete, you're paid to perform, you're paid to compete hard."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, who coached the Ducks from 1993-1997, led Washington to
the Stanley Cup finals in his first season (1997-98), but hasn't
advanced past the first round of the playoffs since.</TE>
<TE>   Only Detroit's Scotty Bowman (ninth season), Carolina's Paul
Maurice (seventh), Ottawa's Jacques Martin (seventh) and St. Louis'
Joel Quenneville (sixth) have been with their teams longer than
Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   If Wilson is fired, he'll become the latest victim of a disturbing
development around the league, according to Murray.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope it's not a new trend because there are some good people
that get let go," Murray said. "I was disappointed that both Ken and
Larry were let go because they've won Cups and that is the ultimate
goal. To see them released from top-notch organizations is not a good
sign.</TE>
<TE>   "I know New Jersey and Dallas were both down a little bit this
season but to me, that's a shared responsibility. The leadership
within the room is supposed to step up to the plate once in a while.
But that seems to be the shock therapy that we're using around the
league."</TE>
<TE>   Brother vs. Brother</TE>
<TE>   Toronto's Robert Reichel will compete for the Czech Republic in
the Olympics and thanks to Germany's advancement into the group of
eight, Reichel will go up against his brother, Martin.</TE>
<TE>   It will be the second time in Olympic history that brothers have
competed against each other in hockey. The other time was in 1960 at
Squaw Valley when Frantisek Pikal from the Czech Republic played
against brother Zdenek Pikal, who competed for Australia.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the first time I've played against him," said Robert,
who is playing in his 11th NHL season after spending two years in the
Czech Republic playing for Litvinov. "I played at the World
Championships in 1996 against him, and 1997 too. I've played him a
few times. Usually, we just talk after the game. Otherwise, I'm
concentrating on my game and hopefully my team."</TE>
<TE>   Martin Reichel has been living in Germany since 1980 and hasn't
played for the Czech Republic in international competition.</TE>
<TE>   Line Shifts</TE>
<TE>   Longtime NHL referee Paul Stewart reportedly plans to retire next
season after 19 seasons. Stewart, who survived colon cancer in 1998,
wants to spend more time with his family and would like to finish
working a Boston-Montreal game, the same two teams who played in his
first NHL game....</TE>
<TE>   Before the season began, not too many people thought the Phoenix
Coyotes would still be in the playoff picture at the Olympic break.
But Coach Bob Francis has done a formidable job keeping the Coyotes'
postseason dreams alive.</TE>
<TE>   Francis has not been afraid to make changes and his latest
decision to shake up his lines, which included the teaming of
Ladislav Nagy and Daymond Langkow, has resulted in nine goals in the
Coyotes' last two games....</TE>
<TE>   The most inspirational story in the league took a positive turn
recently when Saku Koivu said the stomach cancer that has sidelined
him all season is in full remission and he hopes to rejoin the
Montreal Canadiens in April.</TE>
<TE>   Team doctor David Mulder said there were no traces of cancer but
that Koivu has to be monitored closely for the disease for the next
five years. Mulder doesn't think that Koivu could play this season
but said the player has "proved us wrong in every case" during his
recovery and added "nothing's impossible."</TE>
<TE>   Koivu, who underwent chemotherapy to battle non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma, said he will try to work out six times a week in his
comeback attempt....</TE>
<TE>   The once high-flying Edmonton Oilers have crashed back to Earth
and there are reports out of Canada that all but five players are
available. Goaltender Tommy Salo, left winger Ryan Smyth, center Mike
Comrie, defenseman Eric Brewer and forward Georges Laraque are the
only untouchables. Soon to be restricted free agent Anson Carter
would be a great pickup for the Kings, who finally have some depth to
work with.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton's Comrie noticed an illegal curve on one of the sticks
used by Atlanta rookie Ilya Kovalchuk at the NHL's YoungStars game at
Staples Center. Oiler Coach Craig MacTavish informed a referee of the
infraction in a recent game between the teams. After Kovalchuk spent
two minutes in the penalty box for playing with an illegal stick, he
returned to the ice with a legal stick and scored a goal.</TE>

<HD>Back to the Good, Old Days</HD>
<DH>Golf: Restoration of six holes at Riviera to their original
design earns high marks from Tour players.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most of the big names won't be at Riviera until today's practice
rounds, but some of the golfers who will be competing in the Nissan
Open this week were there Monday to play in an invitational pro-am
and test the revamped course.</LD>
<LD>   One of them was Bob Burns, the 1990 NCAA Division II champion from
Cal State Northridge.</LD>
<LD>   Burns, playing with four amateurs, shot a one-over-par 72 and
afterward said he was impressed with the new-look Riviera.</LD>
<TE>   "I like all the changes," he said. "Sure, it's longer now, but
that's the trend these days. I think overall they've improved the
course."</TE>
<TE>   Burns said he particularly liked No. 8, which now sports a new
left fairway bunker. He said the bunker gives the hole more
character.</TE>
<TE>   Burns played in the Buick Invitational at Torrey Pines in La Jolla
last week and finished in a group at two-under and earned $14,760.</TE>
<TE>   K.J. Choi, who finished in a group at six-under at Torrey Pines
and earned $48,600, also liked the changes, although he said Riviera
is now more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Choi, a Korean whose English is limited, said, "Second shot is now
very important."</TE>
<TE>   The recent winds have dried out the course, and Choi said that is
going to make the course more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "The ball travels farther, but it is hard to put spin on it," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Choi didn't expect the scores to be low this week, and that eight
to 10 under could be a winning score.</TE>
<TE>   Among the changes to the historic, 76-year-old Riviera layout is
the restoration of holes five, seven, eight, nine, 12 and 13 to the
original design, as they were before being wiped out by floods in
1939.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not old enough to remember how the course was back then,"
said Burns, 33.</TE>
<TE>   But he's certainly familiar with Riviera.</TE>
<TE>   Although Burns now resides in Knoxville, Tenn., he grew up in the
San Fernando Valley and attended Granada Hills Kennedy High before
moving on to Cal State Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   While in college he worked in the bag room at Valencia Country
Club, and still calls it his home course.</TE>
<TE>   His loyalty lies with Valencia, but he is also fond of Riviera.</TE>
<TE>   "It has always been a great course," he said. "It's even better
now."</TE>
<TE>   No. 5 is now 444 yards, 25 yards longer than before.</TE>
<TE>   The 408-yard No. 7 features a man-made barranca off the right side
of the fairway. It is out of bounds.</TE>
<TE>   No. 8 is 46 yards longer, No. 9 is 38 yards longer, No. 12 has
gained 50 yards, and No. 13 has a slight uphill element.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Kuchar, the 1997 U.S. Amateur champion--his title followed
three in a row by Tiger Woods--was at Riviera, but he didn't play in
the pro-am. He was there to put in time on the driving range and
practice his putting. He missed the cut at Torrey Pines.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been at this course before today," he said, "but I've
always heard everybody rave about it. It looks great and you can't
beat this weather."</TE>
<TE>   Kuchar, who visited some friends in San Diego last weekend after
missing the cut at Torrey Pines, said this was only his second visit
to the Los Angeles area.</TE>
<TE>   "The only other time was when I came out here to be on the
'Tonight Show With Jay Leno.'"</TE>
<TE>   Kuchar played in 11 PGA Tour events last year with sponsor
exemptions and made enough money, $572,669, to earn his PGA Tour card
without going to qualifying school. Kuchar ranked second to Charles
Howell III in PGA Tour nonmember earning. Howell, who will also be at
Riviera this week, earned $1,520,632.</TE>
<TE>   The Nissan Open field has grown by five. Steve Pate of Agoura
Hills and UCLA was added as a sponsor exemption, and four players
earned spots by qualifying at Los Serranos in Chino Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Shriver of Cypress and Steve Sear shot 66s on the North
course to qualify. On the South course, Brad Bell of Sacramento
qualified with a 65 and Eddy Lee of Corona got in with a 69.</TE>
<TE>   The tournament, which has lost Woods but features 32 of the top 50
players in the world, begins Thursday.</TE>

<LD>Kazuhisa Ishii wanted to complete contract negotiations with the
Dodgers quickly so he could be the first player in the team's spring
training complex at Vero Beach, Fla., Thursday. As it turns out, the
Japanese pitcher will probably be the last player to report.</LD>
<LD>   Ishii said Monday he might be late for spring training because he
is still waiting for a visa from the U.S. government. The left-hander
could not apply for the visa until Friday, the day he signed a
four-year, $12.2-million contract with the Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   "We hope to have him early next week, but it's a guessing game,"
said Derrick Hall, the Dodgers' senior vice president for
communications. "But the good thing is he's been throwing all along,
and he's ready to go."</LD>

<LD>Santa Margarita is the No. 1-seeded Division I team in the Southern
Section girls' water polo playoffs that begin today with wild-card
games.</LD>
<LD>   The Eagles will play host to the winner of today's game between
Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley and Long Beach Millikan on Thursday
in a first-round game.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Ana Foothill, the top-ranked team in the division until it
lost to Santa Margarita two weeks ago, is seeded second, Newport
Harbor third and Lake Forest El Toro fourth.</LD>
<TE>   Santa Barbara earned the top spot in Division II after its 11-7
victory last week over second-seeded Ventura in a Channel League
game. The Dons will play the winner of today's wild-card game between
Thousand Oaks and Oxnard Rio Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   Division III and Division V will compete in 32-team brackets that
begin first-round play today.</TE>
<TE>   Three-time defending champion Bell Gardens is the top-seeded team
in Division III and Crescenta Valley is No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside Arlington is the top-seeded team in Division V after
defeating second-seeded Riverside North last week in the final of the
Ivy League tournament. North is not one of the seven teams that
received first-round byes because it is not a league champion.</TE>
<TE>   Corona del Mar is the top-seeded team in Division IV, followed by
fellow Pacific Coast League members Irvine University and Laguna
Beach. Because Laguna Beach finished third in league, it will host a
wild-card game today against Placentia Valencia.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If the NHL wants its best players in the Olympics, and wants the
worldwide exposure the Olympics offer, then the NHL should get
totally into the Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Or it should get totally out.</LD>
<LD>   What happened over the weekend, with several NHL players taking
red-eye flights into Salt Lake City, scrambling to play a game or two
for a national team like Slovakia or Latvia or Germany that was
trying to qualify for the final eight-team Olympic field, then
rushing to catch another late-night or early morning flight back to
their NHL team so that they could suit up for a game Monday night,
was just ridiculous.</LD>
<TE>   Recapping the weekend mess, Ziggy Palffy of the Kings was given
permission by the Kings to play one game over the weekend for
Slovakia and that one game was to have been Sunday. That was
Slovakia's second of three scheduled pool-play games. The Slovaks
were heavily favored to move out of their pool and into the field of
eight.</TE>
<TE>   And the NHL had pretty much left it up to teams as to how much
leave they'd want to give players to run into Salt Lake City over the
weekend and run back home to play one or two more NHL games before
the league shut down for the Olympics. But league officials also made
it clear they did not want to diminish the importance of the NHL
regular season--as if their own playoff format didn't already do
that.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the NHL missed it, but the Olympics started Friday night.
That's what all those fireworks were for. The NHL wants to be big
league but it's bush league. It was NHL players from the U.S. team
who sullied the 1998 Olympics when they trashed hotel rooms after
losing. And this year the NHL has already brought petty bickering to
the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Countries like Slovakia wanted their best team on the ice for the
qualifying rounds. The NHL wouldn't let that happen because the NHL
isn't shutting down until Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   So while the players who will represent the U.S., Canada, Russia,
Finland, Sweden, the Czech Republic, didn't have to worry, guys like
the Kings' Ziggy Palffy and his King coaches and his Slovakia
national team coaches were all put in impossible positions.</TE>
<TE>   King Coach Andy Murray and General Manager Dave Taylor shouldn't
have been forced to play hard ball with the coach and manager of the
Slovakian national hockey team.</TE>
<TE>   Palffy, a hard-working, well-respected King, loves Slovakia, his
country, dearly. He shouldn't have been forced into being torn
between paycheck and country, between sitting on the bench and
watching his countrymen get eliminated from the final round of the
Olympic hockey tournament. He should have been allowed to do what was
right by the Kings, who are fighting for a playoff position and need
to have every player in the best condition.</TE>
<TE>   And who could blame Slovakia Coach Jan Filc for playing Palffy
after saying he wouldn't? There was Palffy sitting in full uniform at
the end of the bench, while Slovakia was losing in an upset to
Germany, 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   So Palffy was given the call. Come in please. And he did. Wouldn't
you? Slovakia doesn't have many chances to win Olympic medals. Had
its team made it into the finals when all its NHL stars would be
free, Murray says the Slovakians would have had a good chance at
winning a medal.</TE>
<TE>   Murray also said the Slovakian management miscalculated by taking
a skeleton team of about 10 from home, hoping that daily fly-ins by
its NHL players would get the Slovaks safely into next week. It
didn't work. Even with Palffy coming in at desperation time Saturday,
Slovakia lost to Germany. With Palffy in street clothes and only
watching, the Slovakians tied Latvia, 6-6, Sunday and were
eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   Palffy wore full gear Saturday, he was told, so that he could be
an inspiration to his teammates. What kind of inspiration is that?</TE>
<TE>   Look, guys! This really good player is wearing our colors. He
can't play. We have a deal. He can only play Sunday. But there he is.
On our bench. Watching.</TE>
<TE>   That's not a pep talk a coach should want to give.</TE>
<TE>   "The NHL has a hard and fast rule," Murray said, "that if your
team is playing, you are obligated to put your best team forward. We
don't fault Ziggy. He wanted to play Saturday, he wanted to play
Sunday. But he also knew what we needed.</TE>
<TE>   "If he'd played Sunday, he would have played five games in five
nights. He's risking injury at such an important time of the season
for us. What do you say to the other players in our locker room who
work hard and do everything they can to help us win?"</TE>
<TE>   Of course Murray should want his best players on the ice in top
condition for every game. So should the coaches of countries with
teams in the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   The Olympics are diminished when Slovakia doesn't make the finals.
The NHL looks desperate when it agrees to have its players in the
Olympics, but only partially.</TE>
<TE>   Even Murray noted that "personally, you can shut down four or five
more days if you wouldn't have the All-Star game."</TE>
<TE>   But then NHL officials wouldn't have a place to wine and dine and
schmooze.</TE>
<TE>   And that's just too bad.</TE>
<TE>   If you agree to have your players in the Olympics, this should be
the rule:</TE>
<TE>   When the athletes march into the Olympic Stadium, when the Olympic
oath is read and the flame is lighted, then no more games in your
league.</TE>
<TE>   The Olympics have begun. The NHL should be dark until that flame
goes out.</TE>

<HD>Kobe Picks Worst Time to Put Team Back in 'I'</HD>

<LD>Now some folks might consider it heckling--the parting shot I yelled
at Kobe Bryant on Monday after badgering and getting nowhere with him
in a news conference after the Laker workout, but all I was trying to
do was make sure he doesn't get booed again tonight.</LD>
<LD>   This is the one NBA game everyone in L.A. has been waiting for:
Kobe versus Michael, but now Kobe is telling us it's "not really"
that special to play Michael Jordan, "it's just another game," and
his responsibility tonight will be to "make sure I get my teammates
involved."</LD>
<LD>   There ought to be a NBA rule tonight that the other eight players
on the court are not allowed to touch the ball. I already love the
fact Shaquille O'Neal is being true to his word about making Kobe the
league's MVP this season, and he won't be around to clog up the
court, but I don't like what I'm hearing from Kobe.</LD>
<TE>   "As a leader, I need to make sure everyone gets involved," Kobe
said, which means when he passes the ball to Slava Medvedenko
tonight, this one could come down to Slava versus Michael, and won't
that be memorable.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WE'RE NOT going to get much help from Phil Jackson, the king of
the party-poopers, who made it clear this game "is not going to be
Michael versus Kobe," or "Michael against me."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, I think Mr. Sacred Hoops is out to sabotage our night on
the town. "I won't have Kobe defending against Michael," he said, and
so Kobe is going to guard Richard Hamilton, and I know you've been
waiting all year for that.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, once the game starts Jackson doesn't do much, so
there's still a chance his two prized pupils will try to impress the
master with their best moves. At the very least, imagine the final 10
seconds of a quarter with Kobe or Michael dribbling the ball at the
top of key and the other one on defense poised for the one-on-one
finale, and you know everyone in Staples Center is going to come to
their feet. Jackson might even stand up, which is something else we
haven't seen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DURING THE All-Star game in Philadelphia, microphones picked up
Jordan telling Kobe they weren't going to let him take over the game,
and Kobe replying, "don't talk me to death--just go out there and do
it."</TE>
<TE>   Now that's the kind of talk everyone was hoping to hear Monday,
but instead Kobe went politically correct, doing his best to quash
the anticipation. I suggested to Kobe that maybe he wasn't telling us
how he really felt.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was going to be stoked about it, I'd tell you guys" said
Kobe--sure, like he's well-known for pouring his heart and soul out
to the media.</TE>
<TE>   Then he really laid it on, and said, "it's time to start picking
it up as a team." I'd like to know why the Lakers didn't think of
that last week when it was Kobe against Kevin Ollie and the Bulls?</TE>
<TE>   Why must the good of the team get in the way of our entertainment?</TE>
<TE>   I asked Kobe if he could put the team's welfare on hold for
another game--like that's a big deal for a team that can turn it on
and off whenever it wants.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to ruin your buzz," he said, and I told him he was, and he
apologized again, but I don't think he really meant it.</TE>
<TE>   And that's where it ended, Kobe walking away and I couldn't help
myself. I yelled after him: "How about just one quarter?" knowing one
scintillating quarter of the old man versus the kid would be an "I
was there moment" to cherish for some time, and Kobe just kept
shaking his head no.</TE>
<TE>   It's not going to happen, of course, because most of us weren't
born in Philadelphia, but you already know how Michael reacts when he
thinks everyone is against him, and now we know when you boo Kobe,
you get his MVP game. Too bad we couldn't hire a few louts from
Philly for a few hours just to get Michael and Kobe going--and then
send the morons back to that miserable hellhole where they belong.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT WAS about 2:30 when Jackson met with the press, and when asked
about Kobe's performance in the All-Star game, he said he didn't see
it because he "didn't want to waste time watching it" while on
vacation.</TE>
<TE>   A little after 3, "The Phil Jackson Show'' made its debut on KMPC
1540 here in L.A., and Jackson told host Chris Myers the game of
basketball is an "evolving sport which we all saw in the All-Star
game."</TE>
<TE>   So did he or didn't he? Myers asked Jackson if he had spent time
during the break scouting, which tells me Myers isn't big on doing
his homework.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he was in Palm Springs getting a "massage, exercise,
facial and pedicure," and that's something else he kept from the
media, or I'd have asked what color nail polish he's using on his
toes these days.</TE>
<TE>   Myers asked Jackson, "Do you have a thought where the interest in
the All-Star game currently lies?"</TE>
<TE>   I have a pretty good idea where Jackson's interest in the All-Star
Game lies, and seeing as how I wasn't getting the straight scoop so
far, I switched stations and had to decide between listening to a
replay of "The Jim Rome Show," or "Doug &amp; Joe" live. It was a pretty
easy choice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Raul:</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like what you wrote about the Dodgers. I've noticed from
the very beginning you're stuck in Gary Sheffield's jock strap.''</TE>
<TE>   If that were true, I believe I'd be in Atlanta right now.</TE>

<LD>The loss to Villanova might mean a slightly lower seeding in the NCAA
tournament for UCLA. Yet there are no regrets for taking the trip.</LD>
<LD>   "We just want to play basketball," guard Rico Hines said. "We're
young and we don't want to sit around over the weekend just because
we had a bye."</LD>
<LD>   A funny thing happened while the Bruins were away: They gained
ground in the Pacific 10 Conference race.</LD>
<TE>   Oregon lost at Stanford and California, leaving Arizona as the
only team with three losses. UCLA, USC, Oregon, Stanford and
California all have four.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins play host to Arizona on Thursday in what might be the
most important regular-season game left on the schedule.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats overcame a 20-point second-half deficit to beat UCLA
at Tucson last month.</TE>
<TE>   Bruin guard Jon Crispin, sitting out the season under NCAA rules
after transferring from Penn State, was in the limelight over the
weekend, although it was not at the game against Villanova.</TE>
<TE>   Crispin and his brother, Joe, had their numbers retired at nearby
Pitman, N.J., High, where they are the two all-time leading scorers.</TE>
<TE>   Joe, a rookie with the Phoenix Suns, and Jon helped Penn State to
the NCAA tournament round of 16 last season. At Pitman, Joe scored
2,651 points, Jon scored 2,319 and the team won state titles in
1996-97 and 1997-98.</TE>
<TE>   "I had nothing but great memories about playing for Pitman," Jon
said. "The atmosphere is better than Penn State, better than UCLA and
better than Phoenix."</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As far as Coach Henry Bibby is concerned, and after seeing every team
in the Pacific 10 Conference at least once, Trojan forward Sam Clancy
is the best player in the league.</LD>
<LD>   "He's the most dominating player," Bibby said. "And other than Sam
Clancy as player of the year in the Pac-10, I would name [Arizona
forward Luke] Walton. If I had to pick someone other than a player on
my team, I would go with Walton. I think he really makes that team
go."</LD>
<LD>   Playing at the top of a 3-2 zone, Walton severely disrupted USC's
passing lanes and had a triple-double in the Wildcats' 97-80 victory
at Tucson on Jan. 17. USC plays first-place Arizona Saturday at the
Sports Arena.</LD>
<TE>   Clancy, meanwhile, is on a run of eight double-doubles in a row
and is the Pac-10's third-leading scorer (21.6) in conference games,
trailing Stanford's Casey Jacobsen (23.2) and Washington's Doug Wrenn
(23). Clancy is also the league's second-leading rebounder (10.1)
behind Stanford's Curtis Borchardt (11.3).</TE>
<TE>   "It's his last go-round ... and there's no tomorrow for Sam,"
Bibby said. "He's trying to set himself up for the [NBA] draft and
get himself in position to get in the [NCAA] tournament. So he's
really working hard."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior forward David Bluthenthal is one of three recipients of the
2002 Marty Glickman Award as outstanding Jewish scholastic athlete of
the year, an honor bestowed by the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in
Commack, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   The other Glickman award recipients are Michigan's Hayden Epstein,
a punter and kicker on the Wolverine football team, and Yale's Sada
Jacobson, the No. 1-ranked fencer in the world in the under-20
women's sabre division.</TE>

<HD>Military to Probe Alleged Abuse of Afghan Prisoners</HD>
<DH>War: Rumsfeld orders an inquiry into reports that U.S. troops beat
villagers taken in raid. Meanwhile, officials deny CIA missile strike
killed civilians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has asked for an investigation
into allegations that a group of Afghans mistakenly taken prisoner by
U.S. Special Forces troops last month was beaten and mistreated, but
senior Pentagon officials said Monday that so far there was no evidence
that such abuse took place.</LD>
<LD>   At a news conference at the Pentagon, officials also defended a CIA
missile strike last week near Zhawar Kili in eastern Afghanistan amid
reports that civilians there had been killed.</LD>
<LD>   The strike by a Hellfire missile from an unmanned Predator drone hit
its intended target, the officials said. Those killed were "not
innocents," said Rear Adm. John D. Stufflebeem, deputy director of
operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</LD>
<TE>   The reports are part of an increasing drumbeat of alleged misfires and
mistakes by U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Pentagon officials say the
situation in Afghanistan is becoming increasingly murky, with former
Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters switching sides or seeking to blend into
the general population.</TE>
<TE>   "To say that conditions in Afghanistan are confusing is an
understatement, you know," said Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke.
"And it's impossible to say these people are on this side and these
people are on that side. People are on multiple sides, and they switch
sides. So there is a great deal of confusion about information in
general. And we do always try to get to [the] truth."</TE>
<TE>   Local officials in Afghanistan say there is a growing body of evidence
that the United States has, in several cases, captured or killed the
wrong people.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. investigators trekked up to the mountainside site of the Hellfire
missile strike late Sunday and left Monday morning, taking small pieces
of human flesh and bone, communications equipment, documents, small
weapons and ammunition, defense officials said.</TE>
<TE>   A report in the Washington Post on Monday said those killed in the
strike had been peasants collecting scrap metal. U.S. officials have said
they believed the targets were Al Qaeda members, in part because of their
Arab-style dress.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not know who the individuals were at the strike site,"
Stufflebeem said. "The indications were there that there was something
untoward that we needed to make go away."</TE>
<TE>   Stufflebeem did not elaborate, citing concerns about the secrecy of
intelligence operations. He said forensics experts plan to conduct DNA
tests on the remains to try to determine the identities of those killed.
U.S. officials reportedly have sought DNA samples from members of
terrorist leader Osama bin Laden's family.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. intelligence official said the CIA continues to believe that
the missile attack "was a good strike on an appropriate target," although
there is no hard evidence suggesting that Bin Laden was among those
killed.</TE>
<TE>   "We still think it was someone senior" in the Al Qaeda terrorist
network, the official said Monday, because the group was so large and
appeared to show deference to one man who appeared taller than the rest.</TE>
<TE>   The official disputed reports that the victims were innocent
civilians. He said the drone had tracked the group for "a long time"
before the order was given to fire a missile.</TE>
<TE>   "No one was going around gathering any scrap metal, I can tell you
that," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the men who were reportedly beaten, they were among 27 Afghans
captured in a Jan. 24 nighttime raid on what military intelligence
analysts had mistakenly identified as a terrorist hide-out in a remote
village in Oruzgan province.</TE>
<TE>   Two told reporters over the weekend that they had blacked out from the
beatings. Others claimed that their ribs had been broken. The men said
they are allies of Afghanistan's interim prime minister, Hamid Karzai,
and were not Taliban or Al Qaeda fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke said Monday that those captured were not "high value" members
of the Taliban militia or Al Qaeda, but she added that they may have been
onetime Taliban allies who switched sides.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors said 21 villagers were killed in the assault. One U.S.
soldier was wounded. The CIA reportedly has begun paying reparations to
victims of the raid.</TE>
<TE>   Stufflebeem said it is plausible that the men were treated harshly
when they were first taken prisoner.</TE>
<TE>   "In that initial encounter, you don't know who's good, you don't know
who's bad, and you don't take the chances, you just secure the area,"
Stufflebeem said. "So everybody's treated the same, and it's relatively
harsh, I would say."</TE>
<TE>   But Clarke and Stufflebeem said military officials were seeking to
determine whether soldiers in the raid did anything inappropriate.</TE>
<TE>   "The investigation is still ongoing. The secretary and Gen. [Tommy]
Franks [the head of U.S. Central Command] have asked for more information

<HD>Animation Drawing New Respect in Hollywood</HD>
<DH>Movies: Three films will be nominated today as Oscar devotes
category to an industry in transition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAUDIA ELLER</AU>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the beginning, there was Snow White.</LD>
<LD>   Walt Disney's lovely songbird made history in 1937, debuting in
Hollywood's first movie-length cartoon. It was an instant creative and
financial sensation.</LD>
<LD>   Today, 65 years later, her legacy will take center stage when three
films will be nominated in a new Oscar category--best animated feature.
The prize represents Hollywood's official, if not belated, acknowledgment
of animation as a bona fide art form.</LD>
<TE>   But the films that made 2001 a record box-office year for animation
hardly resemble their ancestral "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Lifelike computer-generated images have nudged aside traditional
hand-drawn characters in such mega-hits as "Shrek" and "Monsters, Inc.,"
both of which are expected to be nominated today.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the animation industry is redefining itself at a furious
pace, leaving everyone from financiers to artists wondering where the
evolution of technology and tastes will lead. Although the new world of
digital animation is creating opportunities for some, it is leaving
others behind.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry is in a very odd transition now," said Tom Schumacher,
president of Walt Disney Animation. "We're making more animated movies
than ever, they're being made with different techniques, and the nature
by which we make those movies--in a garage or in a studio--is all
changing."</TE>
<TE>   And all this has prompted painful changes and choices not only for
studio chiefs but for the hundreds of displaced animators who made their
living drawing pictures by hand, not by computer mouse.</TE>
<TE>   Jobs once considered essential for hand-drawn movies are no longer
needed in computer animation, which is far less labor intensive than the
traditional style.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a huge amount of dislocation," said Steve Hulett,
business representative of the screen cartoonists' union, which</TE>
<TE>   has seen its membership plummet from a high of 2,800 in 1996 to about
1,500 today.</TE>
<TE>   Among the casualties is Steve Starr. He worked as a traditional
animator at Disney for 26 years. When times were good, he commanded more
than $130,000 a year. Last month, he was laid off and forced to sell his
dream house.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very tough, there's not much out there right now," said Starr,
49, who plans to enroll in a community college course on computer
animation.</TE>
<TE>   Leading the digital charge is another former Disney animator, John
Lasseter, creative chief of Pixar Animation Studios in Northern
California. In 1995, Pixar and partner Disney were behind the movie that
started the animation revolution--"Toy Story"--and continued it with last
year's "Monsters, Inc."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Hollywood, Lasseter is revered as the modern-day Walt
Disney. He believes digital animation is simply the logical extension of
"Snow White," when Disney used a new multi-plane camera to give more
depth to his hand-drawn characters.</TE>
<TE>Studios Still Smarting From Past Expenses</TE>
<TE>   Lasseter said that when he saw early computer graphics coming out of
university research labs in 1980, his first thought was: "Wow, this is
what Walt was always looking to do--getting more dimensionality in his
animated films."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, no amount of wizardry can make up for a lack of
substance. "You need a great story populated by compelling characters
that takes place in believable worlds."</TE>
<TE>   That's what made "Snow White" the highest-grossing movie of its day,
upstaged a couple years later by a movie called "Gone With the Wind." For
its artistic and technical achievement, "Snow White" was awarded a
special Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, other animated films have been nominated for, or received,
Academy Awards, mostly in the musical or short-film categories. Only "Toy
Story" and Disney's 1991 "Beauty and the Beast" have crashed the top
tier--the former a nominee for best screenplay, the latter for best
picture.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly two years ago, however, with hit animated films flooding the
market, the motion picture academy decided it was time for full-length
features to compete head-to-head.</TE>
<TE>   Actor Tom Hanks was tapped to chair the entry screening committee.
Hanks, the voice of "Toy Story's" lovable cowboy, Woody, was a natural
choice.</TE>
<TE>   Hanks believes audiences generally "accept anything in
computer-generated movies, whereas with cell-animated movies they may
say, 'It's just a cartoon.' . . . The eye and mind are being dazzled by
the pure technology and how the story is told."</TE>
<TE>   This is particularly true in an age when a generation of adults, teens
and youngsters has been weaned on MTV, video games and out-of-this-world
special effects in such big-screen groundbreakers as "The Matrix."</TE>
<TE>   Hanks was so seduced by the creative potential of computer animation
that he is elbowing his way into the fray, developing and producing two
projects for Universal Pictures. One is Maurice Sendak's classic "Where
the Wild Things Are." The other is John Nickle's lesser-known book, "The
Ant Bully," a "chance discovery" that Hanks said his 6-year-old son
brought home from school.</TE>
<TE>   But, as with any movie, there are no sure things.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the record jackpots earned by "Monsters, Inc.,"
DreamWorks/Pacific Data Images' "Shrek" and Paramount
Pictures/Nickelodeon's "Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius," there also were three
notable duds last year--Warner Bros.' "Osmosis Jones," Sony Pictures'
"Final Fantasy" and Disney's traditionally animated "Atlantis."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, some studios are still smarting from the huge sums they
poured into animator salaries and production facilities trying to
replicate the success of Disney's 1994 blockbuster, "Lion King."</TE>
<TE>   What they got for their money was a string of expensive
flops--including "Quest for Camelot" and "Titan A.E."--prompting a
wrenching about-face.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox, both of which launched full-scale
divisions, virtually shuttered their animation operations, laying off
hundreds of workers. Even market leaders Disney and DreamWorks
dramatically retrenched as production costs and animator salaries soared
amid heightened competition among the studios.</TE>
<TE>   The studios are being lured back by the smell of the recent successes.
This time, though, they are doing it with caution, mindful of the costly
lessons of the past.</TE>
<TE>   "We're putting our toe in the water with titles that call out to
audiences but we're not committing to spending production money until we
have a screenplay," said Universal Pictures Chairwoman Stacey Snider. The
studio, which last released an animated film in 1995, has three in the
works, including one based on the classic children's book "Curious
George."</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros. too is treading carefully. "Now, if we like a script,
we'll put a team together," said Warner Bros. Chairman Barry Meyer.
"We're not going to lock into a fixed overhead where you're looking to
justify its existence and just push through projects."</TE>
<TE>Traditional Artists Learn Computer Skills</TE>
<TE>   Even studios that have never produced animated films are afraid to
stay on the bench, including Disney-owned Miramax, known for its highbrow
movies, and sister label Dimension Films, known for the horror spoof
series "Scream" and "Scary Movie."</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question about it," said Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein,
"there's a huge audience for these movies."</TE>
<TE>   These days, animation for animation's sake is not enough to justify
the kind of big money gamble of the mid-1990s. Said Weinstein's brother,
Bob, who heads Dimension: "I'm not in the animation business, I'm in the
movie business. To me, I'm buying the story and the talent."</TE>
<TE>   Disney also is reshaping its strategy to reduce costs and risk.
Animation chief Schumacher said that despite the studio's ongoing
commitment to making animated movies, it plans to cut several hundred
more jobs by the end of next year. That would leave roughly 1,000 people
in the animation division.</TE>
<TE>   Most will work on a project-by-project basis, rather than being paid
under costly long-term contracts. Disney and rival DreamWorks also are
cross-training many traditional artists so they can create on computers.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't be surprised that within a couple of years, 95% of the
traditional artists will be trained in computer skills," said
entertainment attorney Nancy Newhouse Porter, who represents a number of
top animators. "Those who don't, limit their options significantly."</TE>
<TE>   For some entrepreneurs, the cutbacks have opened new doors.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of a digital work station--the equipment used to scan
drawings and store them on a computer--has fallen from $50,000 in 1995 to
as low as $2,500 today, according to some estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Huelsman, who teaches computer animation classes at the Los
Angeles Unified School District's Abram Friedman Occupational Center to
displaced and employed studio artists, said: "I have a waiting list
longer than my arm."</TE>
<TE>   The declining costs made it possible for Larry Whitaker to start his
own business, Cornerstone Animation in Glendale, after his contract as a
Disney animation supervisor was not renewed. Whitaker said the technology
lets him experiment with a range of styles with a small core of artists.</TE>
<TE>   Since last year, Whitaker said, Cornerstone's revenue has jumped 15%,
largely because major studios are farming out work.</TE>
<TE>   Whitaker said animation production has become "lean and mean."
Studios, he said, can "use us to keep their overhead down."</TE>
<TE>   Even the big guys are gearing up their digital operations, hoping
maybe to be the next Pixar.</TE>
<TE>   Six months ago, "Jimmy Neutron" director Steve Oederkerk sank $6
million of his own money into building a 40,000-square-foot
computer-animation studio in San Clemente, near his home in San Juan
Capistrano. Oederkerk, best known for his live-action work, said that as
the technology becomes more affordable, it creates vast opportunities
outside the traditional Hollywood system.</TE>
<TE>   'You'll see 19-year-old kids whipping up [computer-generated] movies
and TV shows from their garages."</TE>
<TE>Lines Between Old, New Animation Blur</TE>
<TE>   John H. Williams, a "Shrek" producer, also is forming his own
computer-animation studio in Los Angeles with $100 million in independent
funding to co-finance a slate of movies with a soon to be announced
studio partner.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a much more powerful way of taking you into alternative worlds
with all these textures, complexities and depth," Williams said of
computer-generated imagery.</TE>
<TE>   No one, of course, is predicting the demise of traditional animation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like how you feel when someone sends you a typed letter versus a
handwritten letter," said DreamWorks partner Jeffrey Katzenberg, who as
Disney Studio's former chairman, oversaw the release of such
traditionally animated hits as "Lion King," "Beauty and the Beast" and
"Aladdin."</TE>
<TE>   "There's an intimacy that comes when you receive a handwritten note
and that's what is . . . so special and so singular about traditional
animation."</TE>
<TE>   As the lines between old and new animation blur, so too do the
boundaries between animated and live-action movies.</TE>
<TE>   "Lord of the Rings" and "Gladiator" are just two examples of films
with seamless special effects using the same computer technology as
"Shrek" and "Monsters, Inc."</TE>
<TE>   And this leads some in the movie business to wonder whether Oscar's
new animation category comes too late.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a great thing that it draws attention to animation, but
it's a tricky category," said Disney's Schumacher. "And when I look down
the road five years, it's an even trickier category."</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>
<TE>Animation Now and Then</TE>
<TE>   Disney's "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (1937) was Hollywood's
first movie-length cartoon, winning a special Oscar for artistic and
technical achievements. In the intervening years, Oscars for animation
have mainly been limited to musical and short-film categories. Only one
animated feature, Disney's "Beauty and the Beast" (1991), has been
nominated in the best picture category. This year three films will be
nominated in a new Oscar category--best animated feature. The nominations
will be announced today. Among those considered will be last year's
financially successful, computer-generated films "Monsters, Inc.," "Jimmy
Neutron: Boy Genius" and "Shrek."</TE>

<CX>   Steve Oedekerk--An article Tuesday in Section A on animation
misspelled Steve Oedekerk's name and incorrectly identified him as the
director of "Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius." The movie was directed by John
A. Davis, who also was a credited screenwriter and producer. Oedekerk was
one of the writers and producers of the animated movie, produced by
Davis' DNA Productions studio.</CX>

<HD>LACMA Acquires Islamic Art</HD>
<DH>Museum: The purchase gives county institution one of the world's
top collections in the field.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a move that adds significantly to its diversity and stature, the
Los Angeles County Museum of Art has landed a renowned collection of
Islamic art that it has been seeking for several years.</LD>
<LD>   The acquisition of about 775 objects--to be announced this morning at
a news conference--effectively doubles the museum's already notable
Islamic collection and catapults the Wilshire Boulevard institution into
a league with the world's 10 best places to see historic Islamic art.</LD>
<LD>   The collection of decorative arts, architectural ornaments and
calligraphy was built over nearly 40 years by Maan Madina, a Syria-born
professor emeritus of Middle Eastern languages at Columbia University. He
sold the bulk of his collection to the museum at an undisclosed price and
donated a few additional pieces.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the funds were provided by Camilla Chandler Frost, a longtime
LACMA trustee who is the sister of Otis Chandler, former publisher of The
Times. According to a scholar familiar with the Madina materials, the
collection, which dates from the 7th century to the 19th century, is
worth in the range of $15 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The acquisition of this collection, which illustrates the richness
and diversity of the Islamic culture, is particularly appropriate at this
juncture in our history, but we didn't plan that," said Andrea L. Rich,
president and director of the museum. "We were motivated by the strength
of the collection and the opportunity to acquire it."</TE>
<TE>   Discussions between the museum and Madina have gone on for several
years, Rich said, and he had already lent some of the objects to the
museum for display starting in 1996. They reached a preliminary agreement
several months ago, when Frost decided to underwrite the purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Oleg Grabar, a leading authority on Islamic art who is a professor
emeritus at Harvard and Princeton universities, said that snagging the
Madina collection is a "a major coup, especially for the West Coast. The
East Coast has very remarkable collections in the field. But on the West
Coast, LACMA is the only museum that had something significant, and now
this makes it major."</TE>
<TE>   With the new addition, LACMA's Islamic holding ranks third nationally,
according to Linda Komaroff, the museum's curator of Islamic art. The
collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York of 11,000 to
12,000 pieces is the largest in the country, while the Smithsonian
Institution's Freer and Arthur M. Sackler galleries offer the finest
selection of masterpieces, she said.</TE>
<TE>   LACMA's acquisition also gives the museum world status in Islamic art,
Komaroff said, albeit well behind the top collections, which are at the
British Museum in London, the Louvre in Paris, the Museum of Islamic Art
in Berlin and the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, Russia.</TE>
<TE>   For LACMA, the significance of the Madina collection is more a matter
of breadth and depth than numbers. The current collection of about 1,000
pieces, including many ceramic shards, mainly consists of Persian
material. The new material--including 250 glazed ceramics and tiles, 65
textiles, 50 glass objects and 50 examples of calligraphy--will allow the
museum to present a much more comprehensive picture.</TE>
<TE>   "The strength of this new collection is from Egypt, Syria, Iraq and
Spain," Komaroff said. "The Persian material, including tiles, a book
binding and a wood finial, are things we don't have. It's kind of
serendipitous that the two collections fit together so well; they make
one really great collection."</TE>
<TE>   Among the highlights are a hexagonal, glazed ceramic table made in
Syria during the late 12th century or early 13th century; a glass lamp
created during the same period in the eastern Mediterranean region; and a
double page from a parchment manuscript of the Koran, made in Spain in
the 13th century. Stylized floral designs proliferate on vividly colored
tile works.</TE>
<TE>   Islamic art might be expected to be exclusively religious, but at
least 75% of the pieces in LACMA's collection are secular, Komaroff said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are objects of daily use. You don't have to understand the
religion to appreciate them. Islamic art is perhaps the most accessible
manifestation of a complex civilization."</TE>
<TE>   Complicated objects, such as a star-shaped mosaic made of glazed
tiles, cut and fitted into a pattern, offer insight into the
craftsmanship and intellectual traditions of the decorative arts, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you see something that is beautiful and meant to be touched, it
makes you relate a little better to whomever that work of art was made
for."</TE>
<TE>   Madina, who was born in Syria in 1926 and came to the United States to
do graduate work at the University of Chicago in 1947, could not be
reached for comment. In a statement released by the museum, Madina said
he is "delighted at the acquisition of my collection in its entirety by a
museum that already has substantial holdings of Islamic art complementary
to mine."</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-one pieces from his collection are on view in the museum's
galleries of Islamic art, including some that have been previously
displayed as anonymous loans. An additional 25 or 30 examples will be
installed over the next few months. Plans for an exhibition drawn
exclusively from the collection are in the works, Komaroff said.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition announcement comes as the museum is beginning
fund-raising for a new building, designed by Dutch architect Rem
Koolhaas, that would replace four of the six existing LACMA structures.
It provides for expanded exhibition space for the permanent collection,
which will be arranged according to a global view of artistic
achievements, with the Madina collection falling under the umbrella of
Asian art.</TE>
<TE>   LACMA made its first major commitment to Islamic art in 1973, with the
acquisition of about 650 objects from the collection of New York dealer
Nasli M. Heeramaneck, as a gift of LACMA benefactor Joan Palevsky. A
group of ancient bronzes, ceramics and seals, purchased with funds from
the Ahmanson Foundation, and gifts from individuals have enhanced the
Islamic holdings over time.</TE>
<TE>   Camilla Chandler Frost said her interest in the field has been
reinforced by studies connected to her travels to Turkey, the Arabian
Gulf countries and Iran. As for the Madina collection, "It's one of the
great private collections in America and, thus, a rare opportunity for
LACMA to build on its strength," she said. "I felt that it was so
special, we had to make an effort to acquire it."</TE>
<TE>   Rich said the acquisition is the third step in a strategic plan to
upgrade the museum's encyclopedic collection. In an effort spearheaded by
the board of trustees' collections committee six years ago, curators
filed reports outlining "areas where we could and should fill in, and
areas where there were opportunities to do really significant things,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   That led to targeting three areas that needed bolstering: Latin
American, Korean and Islamic art, Rich said. The museum acquired the
Bernard and Edith Lewin collection of more than 1,800 paintings and works
on paper by Latin American modernists in 1997. The Robert W. Moore
collection of Korean art--consisting of 250 works that range from
ceramics and textiles to paintings and spanning 2,000 years--was added in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   The Madina collection fulfills the mandate for Islamic art, but other
challenges lie ahead, Rich said. At the time the reports were made, the
museum was looking for new leadership in the departments of American art,
decorative art and prints and drawings.</TE>
<TE>   "We now have new, vibrant, active curators in those departments," Rich
said. "They will be doing the same kind of analysis and we will set our
sights for the areas that will really help us."</TE>

<HD>Simon an Eager but Rookie Politician</HD>

high expectations.</DH>

<DL>BAKERSFIELD
</DL>
<LD>Bill Simon Jr. is flashing that Boy Scout grin again, the one
that's a yard wide and makes you wonder if he swallowed a happy pill. He
has just wrapped up a speech to a group of Republican women here, and
their standing ovation has left him pumped.</LD>
<LD>   Cornering his press secretary, the GOP candidate asks the question he
asks after every stop on his long-odds journey to become California's
next governor: "How did I do?"</LD>
<LD>   The aide shrugs, having heard only bits and pieces of the talk. So
Simon--looking hopeful, craving feedback--turns to a reporter: "What did
you think? I've reworked it a little, tried some new stuff. . . . Was it
better than the last time you saw me?"</LD>
<TE>   In a world dominated by cocksure, battle-tested politicians, Bill
Simon is an eager, earnest work in progress, openly delighting in every
stage of his maiden campaign.</TE>
<TE>   He listens to old Ronald Reagan radio addresses in his car, works the
cell phone while on the treadmill, huddles with a "brain trust" he
assembled for policy advice, studies tapes of past gubernatorial
debates--and tries to learn Spanish on the side. If the wealthy Los
Angeles investor loses to a Republican rival March 5, it won't be for
lack of trying.</TE>
<TE>   But Simon must win over an electorate that has proved itself leery of
rich political newcomers--guys like Democrat Al Checchi, who had brains
and $40 million in 1998 but couldn't derail the Gray Davis train. Critics
call Simon a Checchi rerun, right down to his failure to vote in three
recent elections. They say only hubris--or political naivete--would drive
him to seek the governorship on his very first shot at elected office.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's friends and family insist the cheerful, unpretentious man they
call Billy is different. He most certainly is not, they say, a restless
master of the universe out to conquer yet another mountain. Rather, he is
driven by an ethic of public service seemingly etched on his DNA.</TE>
<TE>   He evolved in the long shadow of an extraordinary father, Nixon
administration Treasury Secretary William E. Simon. A mercurial
taskmaster, Simon Sr. demanded unswerving excellence from his eldest boy,
who rarely veered off task.</TE>
<TE>   Simon the son launched his campaign just six months after his father's
death, but friends and relatives say the bold bid for the state's biggest
job has less to do with paternal legacy than his own devotion to charity
and his Catholic faith. He prays each morning and makes regular
pilgrimages to Lourdes, the shrine at the foot of the Pyrenees. Over the
last decade, as success in business left him feeling "strangely empty,"
he has committed more and more time to good works--even hosting an
inspirational cable show, "Sundays With Simon."</TE>
<TE>   "Bill could have lived the life of the preppy party boy, using his
sinecure to run around and play golf and have a good time," says John
Morrissey, his neighbor in Pacific Palisades.</TE>
<TE>   "But he's a doer, and he's tried hard to make something of the gifts
he has. I honestly think he's in this for the purest of reasons."</TE>
<TE>Lattes on Doorsteps</TE>
<TE>   A baby boomer with old-fashioned good manners and a self-deprecating
wit, Simon is described by friends as a guy who's never too busy to
return a phone call--and likes to surprise neighbors by leaving morning
lattes on their doorsteps.</TE>
<TE>   Reared in New Jersey, he settled in California a dozen years ago and
has adopted the Golden State lifestyle with gusto. He surfs with
12-year-old daughter Lindsay, hikes with wife Cindy in the Santa Monica
Mountains and loves nothing better than a backyard barbecue.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a personal fortune that could buy Brioni suits and dinners at
Spago, Simon is a decidedly unflashy guy whose friends joke he's never
spent more than $5 on a haircut. He all but gave up drinking after a DUI
conviction in his 20s, and now, at 50, his only apparent vice is a
cheeseburger addiction.</TE>
<TE>   "What's that saying about the good example being the most irritating?
Well, that's Bill," jokes Ted Knetzger, a boyhood friend.</TE>
<TE>   Being the good example, however, has not always been easy.</TE>
<TE>   Like others who are both namesakes and first-born sons of powerful
men, Simon has borne the pressure of great expectations. One of his five
sisters, Mary Streep, can still picture young Billy holed up in his room
with a glass of iced tea, "studying, studying, studying," while the rest
of the brood played gin rummy or dominoes with Dad.</TE>
<TE>   As a teenager, Simon was on the prep school honor roll and mastered
German and Russian. At the same time, he was serving as captain of the
tennis team, reciting the Mass in Latin and befriending poor kids as a
Big Brother. Aside from a nasty temper on the court--his parents once
took away his racket for a month--he was the kid who "always did the
right thing," recalls his younger brother Peter.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's drive and diligence are rooted partly in his father's humble
beginnings--and his promise that the sky was the limit for those who try
hard. The senior Simon was a weak student in college, working at an ice
house and changing truck tires when Billy was a young boy. But a chance
meeting with a Wall Street executive abruptly opened a door, and the
elder Simon pushed through it, launching his storied career in finance.
Before long, the family had left their cramped basement apartment behind,
ultimately settling in a three-story Tudor in Summit, N.J., when Billy
was in fourth grade.</TE>
<TE>   For years, however, his father kept the extent of his success a secret
from the seven children--and from his wife, Carol. A former model who
managed her bulging household with warm efficiency, she clipped coupons,
knit radiator covers and allowed Billy a $20 tennis racket, not the $30
Davis Imperial he coveted.</TE>
<TE>   The children learned the magnitude of their father's wealth when he
was tapped for the Treasury spot by President Nixon in 1973. Simon got
the news from his college roommate, who came across a newspaper story
pegging his father's income at $3 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all shocked, because we'd honestly had a pretty ordinary
life," Simon recalls. "We had a station wagon, I'd always had
jobs--cutting lawns, working as a hospital orderly."</TE>
<TE>   The elder Simon--who went on to serve as Nixon's energy czar and then
amass a fortune through leveraged buyouts--died in 2000. But his imprint
is visible on his son, sometimes painfully so.</TE>
<TE>   On the campaign trail, Simon notes that his dad often derided him as
"one of the great minds of the 13th century" when he did something dumb.
He makes a joke of it, but Streep recalls that their father could "slice
you in half with a single comment." The parenting style, Peter Simon
adds, was "not violent, but definitely forceful."</TE>
<TE>   Billy Simon left home for Williams College in 1969, a year of anti-war
protests, sexual liberation and psychedelic drugs. It might have been a
time for experimentation, for rebelling. It was not.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Simon was captain of the tennis and squash teams, got elected
class president and hit the books--hard. "Bill didn't grow his hair long
or convert to Islam," recalls Bill Eyre, a college friend. Vietnam loomed
as a possibility, but the draft was canceled two weeks before his number
was due to be called.</TE>
<TE>   Simon had planned a career in medicine, but abandoned that idea after
a string of Cs in science classes. Instead, he followed his father to
Wall Street, sharing a brownstone in Greenwich Village with a bunch of
pals.</TE>
<TE>Currency Trader, Enjoying Life</TE>
<TE>   Working as a currency trader, Simon romped around the city with his
twentysomething friends, enjoying what he has called "a wilderness
period." In 1978, he was stopped for drunk driving. Refusing a sobriety
test, he was automatically convicted of a misdemeanor under New Jersey
law.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, says his boyhood friend Knetzger, Simon "realized he had
ceded a bit of control of his life to the fun elements associated with
cocktails. He made a deep commitment to handle that, and he has been very
successful."</TE>
<TE>   Simon calls the DUI a mistake of "youthful exuberance," one he regrets
and has never repeated. He drinks only rarely now because "as I got
older, life picked up speed, and I didn't have time for much of anything
but work and family."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the DUI, Simon met a bridesmaid at his brother's
wedding--Claudia Matthews--and married her. The couple moved to Boston,
where Simon enrolled in law school, having revived an old dream of
someday making a living in a courtroom. He got the law degree, but the
marriage--while producing a daughter, Cary, now 20--didn't take.</TE>
<TE>   Simon calls the divorce, and eventual church annulment, perhaps the
most painful time in his life. Aside from the obvious dilemma it posed
for a strict Catholic, the split made the boy who never blundered feel as
if he'd let everyone down.</TE>
<TE>   "You feel awful, like you made a public mistake," Simon says. He
remains friends with his first wife and close to their daughter, but
calls the split "just very, very sad" and "embarrassing."</TE>
<TE>   It was his mother who finally pulled Simon out of his gloom and onto a
path that would define his adult life. She told him to volunteer at
Covenant House, an organization that helps homeless kids, "where I'd meet
some people who really had it tough." He followed her advice.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd get these kids right off the street, and we'd try to figure out
their problems, how to help them. It was an incredible experience for
me," Simon recalls.</TE>
<TE>   As his interest in charity grew, Simon's professional life took
another turn. After three years at a law firm, he signed on with the U.S.
Attorney's Office in New York, working under the man who would become
that city's world-famous mayor, Rudolph Giuliani. Like others in the
office, Simon shouldered a mixed load, defending FBI agents while
prosecuting drug dealers and chasing the assets of organized crime
families.</TE>
<TE>   Simon and Giuliani stayed in touch over the years, and their bond is
proving fruitful. Giuliani appears in Simon's campaign ads and has
headlined lucrative fund-raisers on both coasts.</TE>
<TE>   After three years as a government attorney, Simon veered back into the
business world, joining his brother and father to create an investment
firm. The transition was a bumpy one. The patriarch was endowed with a
sizable ego and made clear where he stood in the pecking order. At the
time, Simon told a friend he feared he "might just be serving coffee to
Dad."</TE>
<TE>   But eventually, recalls sister Mary Streep, "Billy and Peter started
standing up to him. They hashed it out, and they all started to bloom."</TE>
<TE>Volunteered to Move West</TE>
<TE>   When the trio decided to expand William E. Simon &amp; Sons' investments
in the Pacific Rim, it was Bill Jr. who volunteered to move West in 1990
and open the firm's Los Angeles office. Simon and his wife Cindy, whom he
married in 1986, settled in Pacific Palisades, where they now live in a
$3-million, seven-bedroom home with daughter Lindsay and sons William
III, 14, and Griffin, 9.</TE>
<TE>   With his investment business flourishing, but leaving him feeling
unfulfilled, Simon began devoting more time to charity. The evolution was
a natural one.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's parents had made it clear that "giving back was going to be
part of who we were," he said. To underscore his message, Simon's father
ordered his seven children to master Andrew Carnegie's essay "The Gospel
of Wealth," which exhorts the moneyed to dispense their fortune "to
produce the most beneficial result for the community." In that regard,
Simon's greatest passion has been Covenant House.</TE>
<TE>   Since moving west, he has served a term as its Los Angeles chairman,
guided fund-raising campaigns and recruited other power players to the
board. He also continues to spend hands-on time, says George Lozano,
executive director of Covenant House California: "It's not just about the
board or writing checks for Bill."</TE>
<TE>   At Catholic Charities of Los Angeles, where he is vice chairman, Simon
gets credit not just for improving fiscal accountability but for dropping
in on programs in the field, making sure they deliver services as
promised. And at Good Samaritan, a charity Simon launched with a friend,
he screens grants to Southern Californians in distress.</TE>
<TE>   Underpinning much of his philanthropy--and his everyday life--is
Simon's Catholic faith. Besides his frequent visits to Lourdes, where he
helps the sick into its healing baths, he and his father once had a
private audience with Pope John Paul II.</TE>
<TE>   In a published essay, Simon said he has sensed through prayer that
"God wanted me to preach."</TE>
<TE>   "There is serenity when one realizes that someone else is in charge,"
he wrote, "especially when that someone is God."</TE>
<TE>   Those who know Simon confirm that he holds religious principles quite
dear, but say he does not demand the same standard for those around him.</TE>
<TE>   On the campaign trail, his faith comes up only when he outlines his
position on abortion: "As a Catholic," he says, "I am pro-life." He
typically adds that his wife is pro-choice, and that the law on abortion
is settled, so "there's not much a governor can do."</TE>
<TE>   The timing of Simon's quest to become governor, coming just after his
father's death, has prompted some theorizing about whether he's trying to
outdo his famous dad. The candidate says there's no connection. Rather,
he feels that what he calls the "house of California" is crumbling. And
he believes he can help.</TE>
<TE>   Like many political greenhorns, however, Simon has found that
campaigning is not as easy as it looks. He excels at working a
room--exuding warmth and openness, finding a thread that connects him to
whomever he's wooing. But when it comes to debates or speeches before
large groups, he is less natural, and displays a boyish enthusiasm that,
in the cynical world of politics, tends to look contrived.</TE>
<TE>   Simon has also struggled with another consequence of campaigning--the
relentless media spotlight. Public attention is something he has
vigilantly avoided in his business life. But now he's a candidate,
offering himself for inspection. And reporters want to tour his home,
meet his kids and know his net worth, all requests he has denied.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very public thing--you're out there tooting your own horn,
and the attention is different for me," Simon says.</TE>
<TE>   More problematic, Simon is reluctant to put on the hard press when it
comes to the lifeblood of politics--fund-raising. "I won't risk losing a
friend over it," he says. So he trails former Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan in money raised, and by last month had been forced to loan his
campaign $2.3 million--about half his total contributions.</TE>
<TE>   He has also shown a distaste for attacking Riordan, the Republican
front-runner and a friend who coaxed Simon into the race before deciding
to join it himself. And he has found himself forced to explain his
failure to vote in primaries in 1996, 1998 and 2000: He was tied up at
work, he says, but admits "there's no excuse."</TE>
<TE>Political Newcomer, Economic Conservative</TE>
<TE>   He may be new to the game, but Simon is well aware that his anonymity
makes him a longshot. Still, he hopes his message as an economic
conservative with a philanthropist's heart will turn some heads.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's critics admit many of his ideas have merit. But they wonder
why he's starting at the top. Why not run, say, for attorney general, a
job that meshes well with his experience as a prosecutor?</TE>
<TE>   "What you have here is another example of the arrogant guy who thinks
his wealth can buy the race," says Sean Walsh, policy director for the
other GOP contender, Secretary of State Bill Jones. "Maybe consultants
filled his head with dreams of grandeur. But you'd think a guy with his
background would have been able to resist the siren song."</TE>
<TE>   Simon says it's fair to question whether his experience qualifies him
for the job. Indeed, his life has been replete with skeptics questioning
whether he won a job or honor the hard way, or merely by birthright.</TE>
<TE>   That's to be expected, Simon says. But he still bristles at those who
"seem to be saying, 'How dare you run?'</TE>
<TE>   "Politicians don't have a monopoly on leadership, and fortunately we
live in a great country, where people can step up and say, 'I don't like
what's going on and I think I can make a difference.'</TE>
<TE>   "If the voters say, 'I don't agree with you and I don't want to give
you a chance,' then that's fine. I've given it my best shot."</TE>

<HD>A Lonely Quest for Safer Cars</HD>
<DH>Thousands are killed or crippled each year in rollover crashes. A
former GM engineer says strengthening roofs would save lives, but auto
makers say he's wrong.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The videotape shows an older gent in a cable-knit sweater and
tennis shorts, strapped into the frame of a car that is hanging
upside-down from a winch.</LD>
<LD>   The man is Don Friedman, a former General Motors Corp. executive, and
his aim is to prove that stronger roofs on cars and trucks would save
lives in rollover wrecks. An estimated 26,000 Americans suffer serious or
fatal injuries in such accidents each year.</LD>
<LD>   On this Sunday afternoon in 1998, Friedman is in his son's yard in
Santa Barbara, sitting in a car with a reinforced roof. It will be
dropped from a height of 1 foot, approximating what Friedman says is the
typical impact in rollovers. If Friedman is right, the fortified roof
will save his neck. An ambulance is standing by, in case he's wrong.</LD>
<TE>   Technical snafus delay the test, so Friedman is left hanging for 45
minutes, his south end pointing north. In his frustration, he calls on
some of the colorful language he learned in the Navy. Finally, the
countdown begins, the car falls, and Friedman emerges--irascible but
unharmed.</TE>
<TE>   The tape is just one, albeit the most unorthodox, of the tools
Friedman has used in his crusade to force manufacturers to strengthen
vehicle roofs.</TE>
<TE>   During the last dozen years of a long and eventful engineering career,
Friedman has made "roof crush" his cause. In courtrooms, conferences and
technical papers, he has passionately made the case that with a few more
pounds of steel, costing an extra $20 to $50 a vehicle, auto makers could
prevent thousands of deaths and catastrophic injuries each year.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman also has sought to expose what he and allies say is
disinformation--auto makers' contention that there is no cause-and-effect
relationship between smashed roofs and severe injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers say that vehicle roofs are sufficiently robust and that
the safety value of making them stronger would be almost nil. Auto makers
and their research scientists contend that people are injured in
rollovers because they fall headfirst into the roof as it hits the
ground, not because the roof collapses on them.</TE>
<TE>   The final word in the debate rests with the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, which sets vehicle safety rules. Its current roof
safety standard, adopted 31 years ago, was largely shaped by the auto
industry.</TE>
<TE>   After years of delay, the agency began a review of the standard last
fall. It is not clear when, or whether, it will revise the rule.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, a battle of experts is playing out in courtrooms
across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman, 74, is the leading authority on the strengthen-the-roofs
side of the argument. His passion and erudition are so winning that
jurors have been known to ask for his autograph. Even his courtroom
adversaries acknowledge his effectiveness. Auto safety advocates view him
as an oracle.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look simply at effectiveness in . . . advocating this issue .
. . and holding manufacturers accountable through product liability
litigation, he is No. 1," said Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center
for Auto Safety, a consumer advocacy group in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The auto industry takes a different view. "Mr. Friedman is a
well-known, paid expert for plaintiffs," said Jay Cooney, director of
legal communications for GM. His "statements are self-serving and in
furtherance of his career."</TE>
<TE>   Rollovers are the most dangerous type of motor vehicle accident, based
on the percentage of people killed or badly hurt. Each year, there are
about 250,000 rollovers, involving about 350,000 drivers and passengers.
About 10,000 die and about 16,000 are seriously injured. The toll has
risen gradually as a consequence of America's love affair with
sport-utility vehicles and pickups, which are less stable than cars.</TE>
<TE>Roof Collapse Debated as Cause</TE>
<TE>   In terms of the human cost, the deaths may not be the worst of it.
Thousands of rollover victims have suffered brain damage or paralysis,
with all of their life-wrecking effects.</TE>
<TE>   Roof failure is not the only culprit. If vehicles, particularly SUVs
and pickups, were more stable, there would be fewer rollovers. The number
of victims would be reduced if everyone wore seat belts and if the belts
fit more snugly.</TE>
<TE>   But roof crush may cause as many as 6,900 serious to fatal rollover
injuries each year--26% of the total, according to NHTSA.</TE>
<TE>   Auto makers say that roof collapses are not to blame. Their
explanation, sometimes called the "roof dive" theory, goes like this:</TE>
<TE>   When a vehicle flips over, the occupants drop toward the roof. Even
when they are wearing seat belts, their heads typically reach the roof
because of slack in the belts. So when the roof hits the ground, the head
absorbs the impact. The weight of the body pressing down on the neck adds
to the force. Whether or not the roof holds up, the damage has been done.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman contends that people almost never fall to the roof with
enough force to get badly injured. That's the point he sought to make
with his 1998 video, which he has played in court. He contends that it
takes the additional impact from the roof collapse to cause serious harm.</TE>
<TE>   Owlish-looking under tufts of white hair, Friedman is paid $400 an
hour as an expert witness for plaintiffs. But he is comfortable
financially and says it's not about the money.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman has helped numerous plaintiffs in rollover cases win sizable
settlements or jury awards. But he is determined to see the federal
standard toughened. In his view, litigation is at best an after-the-fact
remedy--helping only when people already have lost loved ones, or the use
of their arms and legs.</TE>
<TE>   Exhibit A is John Hess, who was a passenger in a Ford pickup that
flipped on Christmas Day 1988. The roof collapsed. The Castaic resident,
who had been a construction worker, a motorcycle rider and a bouncer in a
country and western bar, at 28 became a guy in a wheelchair, with no
bladder control.</TE>
<TE>   Hess sued Ford. Friedman testified on his behalf, and Hess won $12.5
million in damages. But the case is still on appeal, and after 13 years,
Hess hasn't seen a dime of the award.</TE>
<TE>   With such victims in mind, Friedman at times has made his campaign
personal, as in a recent letter to a principal author of GM-sponsored
studies that support the industry's position on roof safety.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope you have no problem," Friedman wrote, "living with the thought
that you were responsible for perpetrating this deception and its
horrendous social cost."</TE>
<TE>Designed Missile Guidance System</TE>
<TE>   When Friedman joined the executive ranks of GM at age 33, he already
had begun to make his mark. In 1953, while still in his 20s and working
for a defense contractor, he designed the guidance system for the
Sidewinder heat-seeking missile.</TE>
<TE>   He was lured to GM in 1960, to run a division of the company's
research lab in Santa Barbara. During the next eight years, Friedman and
his team did the conceptual design of the lunar rover vehicle that the
Apollo astronauts took to the moon. They patented the electric drive
system used in many electric cars today. Under a contract with the
Department of Transportation, Friedman also designed the experimental,
gas-stingy "minicar."</TE>
<TE>   But Friedman, a restless and creative thinker, grew tired of GM. When
GM turned down the government's request to build a prototype of the
minicar, Friedman saw his chance. He left the company, took the federal
contract with him and founded Minicars Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman soon became a leading research and development contractor for
NHTSA. He did research on air bags, interior padding and protection from
frontal, side and rear collisions. He designed and built experimental
vehicles to demonstrate enhanced safety features.</TE>
<TE>   This work proved particularly entertaining for Friedman's growing
family. Susie Bozzini, one of his daughters, remembers hanging around the
test site to watch cars getting battered to bits. While her dad and his
crew set up crash tests, "me and my sisters would play with the dummies,"
she said. Then "we'd all line up on the dock--plugging our ears, of
course--and . . . they would run the car into the wall."</TE>
<TE>   Friedman eventually tired of government work. In the mid-1980s, he
turned over Minicars to his engineer son Keith and went into the expert
witness business.</TE>
<TE>Government Adopts Safety Standard</TE>
<TE>   At the time, roof strength was becoming a more pressing issue than
ever before.</TE>
<TE>   Up to then, pickups and vans had been used mainly as work and cargo
vehicles and only rarely to carry people. As a result, many of the
federal government's vehicle safety standards did not apply to them. By
the late 1980s, that was changing. By 2001, Americans were buying more
light trucks--a category that consists of SUVs, pickups and
minivans--than cars. Because of their higher road clearance and top-heavy
design, light trucks flip more often than cars do.</TE>
<TE>   Within the industry, the roof safety rule is known as Standard 216.
Its origin illustrates how industries sometimes heavily influence
regulations meant to protect the public. The nation's auto safety
standards stem from an act of Congress in 1966. NHTSA got the task of
writing the standards. The fledgling agency lacked manpower and
experience and relied heavily on the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Developing a reliable test of roof strength was no easy task. Simply
staging rollovers would not work, because no two are completely alike. A
roof that collapsed in one rollover might survive another. The trick was
to create a test on a motionless vehicle that would reflect the real
world. And the auto makers were more than glad to help.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers had long been interested in how their roofs held up in
accidents. As early as 1933, GM was rolling vehicles down hills and
dumping them off ramps to see what happened to the roofs, according to an
internal company report produced in court.</TE>
<TE>   A Ford Motor Co. engineer asserted in the 1960s that roof strength
definitely mattered. "People are injured by roof collapse," the engineer,
John R. Weaver, said in a memo. "The total number of nationwide deaths
and injuries cannot be estimated, but it is a significant number."</TE>
<TE>   Strong roofs would become more important as seat belt use increased,
Weaver said. That's because the belts hold people erect during rollovers,
putting them at greater risk if the roof fails. "It seems unjust to
penalize people wearing effective restraint systems by exposing them to
more severe rollover injuries than they might expect with no restraints,"
he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In 1966, anticipating the new federal requirements, GM's head of
automotive safety engineering, Louis C. Lundstrom, set an ambitious goal
of building roofs "strong enough to withstand a 70-mph ground-level
rollover" and ordered drop tests, according to an internal document.</TE>
<TE>   But GM and Ford, in separate tests, found vehicle roofs collapsing in
drops from various heights, documents show.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Bertelson, a former Ford safety manager who testifies for
plaintiffs in accident cases, said that "the first drop tests they did at
Ford literally shocked the engineers, and they almost couldn't believe
what was happening."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, the auto makers focused on designing "a test that we can pass,"
Bertelson said.</TE>
<TE>   GM engineers developed a device for testing roof strength--a hydraulic
ram that pushed a steel plate down on the front edge of the roof. The
company demonstrated the device to other car makers and to NHTSA and
recommended its use.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA agreed to forgo a drop test and instead built Standard 216
around the GM test device and test method.</TE>
<TE>   As a former GM engineer testified in 1996: "This 216 method was
actually developed first at GM and presented to the government and . . .
adopted by the government as the test method for roof crush resistance."</TE>
<TE>Friedman, Others Highlight Flaws</TE>
<TE>   The standard required that roofs withstand a force of at least 1.5
times their weight, or 5,000 pounds--whichever was less--without giving
way more than 5 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Roofs that easily pass the test can still collapse in rollovers.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman and others point to several defects in the standard--the most
basic being that in rollovers, the force applied to the roof often
exceeds 1.5 times the vehicle weight.</TE>
<TE>   Other deficiencies have been noted by the industry itself in internal
documents produced in court. For example, industry tests have shown that
the windshield contributes as much as 30% or more of the roof strength
measured in the Standard 216 test. That would be fine if windshields
remained in place in rollover wrecks. In fact, experts say, the
windshield almost always pops out after the first roll.</TE>
<TE>   Another flaw is that the test applies nearly vertical force to the
roof. In real rollovers, there also are strong lateral forces on the roof
because vehicles slide as well as fall.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman has performed crush tests on more than a dozen vehicle models
but with the windshields removed and force applied at more of an angle.
All of the vehicles passed the federal test with room to spare. They all
failed Friedman's version.</TE>
<TE>   A similar demonstration by Friedman served as dramatic evidence last
year in a roof crush case in New York. The model involved, a Chevrolet
Suburban, had withstood more than 10,000 pounds of force in the Standard
216 test. But in a videotape played for the jury, the same model, without
windshield, was lowered to the ground at a 36-degree angle--typical,
Friedman says, of how a roof touches down. When the weight on the roof
reached 4,400 pounds, it had collapsed more than 5 inches.</TE>
<TE>   The jury returned a $5.2-million verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Auto makers have conducted sophisticated research to bolster their
contention that worries about roof strength are misguided.</TE>
<TE>   In 1975, Edward A. Moffatt, a GM accident investigator with a
doctorate in bioengineering, put forth the theory that people weren't
being hurt by roof failures but rather from falling to the roof as it hit
the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Several years later, GM sponsored a pair of studies to test the
theory. Moffatt, by then a private consultant, worked with GM engineers
to stage the most elaborate rollover tests ever performed--then or since.
The studies became known as the Malibu series, after the Chevrolet
Malibus used.</TE>
<TE>   The studies told what happened when 16 Malibus were subjected to
multiple rolls. Eight of the cars had standard roofs, and the other eight
had roofs strengthened with roll cages--networks of steel bars. On-board
cameras tracked the movements of crash dummies as the cars tumbled.
Instruments mounted on the dummies' heads and necks measured the force of
impact with the roof.</TE>
<TE>   Both studies counted the number of "potentially injurious impacts" to
the dummies.</TE>
<TE>   As expected, the standard roofs suffered extensive damage, whereas the
reinforced roofs held up well. Yet the frequency of injurious impacts,
according to the studies, was almost the same.</TE>
<TE>   The authors included this disclaimer: "It is not the intent of this
paper to state that these levels of impact would cause a particular
injury to a person."</TE>
<TE>   Their conclusion: "The results of this work indicate that roof
strength is not an important factor in the mechanics of head/neck
injuries in rollover collisions."</TE>
<TE>   The auto makers now had a potent weapon to wield in court.</TE>
<TE>Discovered Studies on Eve of Trial</TE>
<TE>   Friedman encountered the Malibu studies in 1989, as he was preparing
to testify in his first roof crush trial. The case had been filed against
GM by a New York man whose wife had become a quadriplegic and later
killed herself.</TE>
<TE>   As he sat on his bed in a New York hotel room and pored over the data,
Friedman came to a stunning realization: The studies, he believed, were
highly misleading and proved the opposite of their stated conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the dummies in the two sets of cars suffered about the same
number of injurious hits, as defined by the authors. But, Friedman saw,
the average impact sustained by the dummies was much greater in the
standard-roof cars than in those with reinforced roofs. And virtually all
of the heaviest impacts, most likely to cause severe injury, occurred in
the standard-roof cars, the data showed.</TE>
<TE>   "You just cannot look at the data and believe that you're equally safe
in a roll-caged vehicle as in a production car," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman tore into the studies when he took the stand. As the jury was
reaching its verdict, the family accepted a multimillion-dollar
settlement from GM.</TE>
<TE>   After the trial, Friedman attacked the Malibu studies at every
opportunity--at engineering conferences, in technical papers and in
court. With Carl E. Nash, a former senior NHTSA official, Friedman held
workshops for plaintiff's attorneys and experts, prepping them to
challenge the Malibu results.</TE>
<TE>   Moffatt said he stands behind the studies, which he described as "the
most nit-picked set of crash tests in the history of the world."</TE>
<TE>   He said that, contrary to Friedman's criticism, the researchers did
not skew their findings to support the industry's position.</TE>
<TE>   "I have devoted my life to rollover research, because I think it's
very, very important," he said. "My research is 100% correct. It's 100%
honest . . . and it is all going toward a better understanding of the
true mechanics of rollover."</TE>
<TE>A Believable Witness in Court</TE>
<TE>   Whenever Friedman testifies in a roof crush case, Moffatt or one of
his Malibu coauthors is sure to appear for the defense.</TE>
<TE>   These confrontations consist of hours or even days of
headache-inducing testimony about delta Vs and translational velocity,
cadaver tests and the biofidelity of crash dummies. The technical issues
are so complex that only those who are being paid by one side or the
other can even pretend to understand them. So being believable is at
least as important as being right.</TE>
<TE>   Whether wowed by Friedman's intellect, or charmed by his gruffness and
passion, jurors seem to respond well to him.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman is "a fabulous witness," because "it's obvious that he
really, really, really believes what he is doing," said Michael Piuze, a
Los Angeles plaintiff's lawyer who has won three large roof crush
verdicts with Friedman's help.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman's "a dangerous witness," said Warren Platt of Snell &amp; Wilmer,
a leading automotive defense firm. "The guy's a zealot, and you can take
that as a compliment or criticism. Sometimes, it resonates on the jury."</TE>
<TE>   Expert witnesses are supposed to appear pleasant and unflappable,
never rising to the bait, though Friedman must have skipped that page of
the manual.</TE>
<TE>   Consider what happened when a defense lawyer, during a lengthy
cross-examination, caught him in a mistake. "So you learned something
from me," the lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   "I am learning that you're a very sneaky guy," Friedman replied. Then,
in Friedman's version of withdrawing an insult, he said: "I apologize if
I stated something derogatory about your character, even though it might
be true."</TE>
<TE>   Adversaries complain that Friedman, like many experts, is prone to
tailor his research and testimony to suit his clients. They have derided
his videotaped drop test as a parlor trick, arguing that in real
rollovers, victims take sharper blows to the head and neck than Friedman
did, whether or not the roof holds up.</TE>
<TE>   After losing a big roof crush case in which Friedman spent 17 days on
the stand, GM lawyer Vincent Galvin blasted the "chameleon-like quality
of his opinions."</TE>
<TE>   "I think he honestly believes what he's saying," Galvin said. But
cross-examining Friedman, he said, "is like trying to herd cats or push
jello around." He "just says what he wants to say."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his passionate involvement in the courtroom wars, Friedman
glumly admits that the litigation hasn't made roofs any stronger. What's
needed, he maintains, is government action.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, NHTSA said it was performing research and would soon
determine whether Standard 216 should be revised.</TE>
<TE>   Not until last fall did the agency request comments to assist it "in
upgrading [the standard] . . . to reduce injuries and fatalities . . .
resulting from roof intrusion during rollover crashes."</TE>
<TE>   Friedman and other safety advocates called for a stronger standard. GM
and other auto makers, citing the Malibu tests, argued for the status
quo.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Coben, an Arizona lawyer who has sued auto makers in roof crush
cases, said in his comments to NHTSA that the issue was simple.</TE>
<TE>   "What possible harm can result from strengthening the structure that
supports the roof?" Coben wrote. "I submit there is no harm, and if there
is a chance that even one life can be saved . . . then a new standard
should be adopted."</TE>
<TE>   Until that happens, Friedman will keep pushing. "It's such an
egregious situation," he says. "Now I'm at the end, where I want to see
something done.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not giving up. I don't give up easy."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The FBI warned Monday night that a suspected terrorist from Yemen
and as many as 16 associates could be planning an attack against
Americans as early as today.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI identified the main suspect as Fawaz Yahya Al-Rabeei, a Yemeni
national born in Saudi Arabia in 1979.</LD>
<LD>   The alert said that an attack could occur in the United States or
against U.S. interests in Yemen. It was the most specific of the four
nationwide alerts that the FBI has issued since Sept. 11, following
earlier warnings that some condemned as vague and alarmist.</LD>
<TE>   "The credibility of the threat on this one appears a little stronger
than the previous alerts," said a law enforcement official who requested
anonymity. "But we don't have information on any specific targets."</TE>
<TE>   The alert was triggered by information gathered both at the Guantanamo
Bay naval base in Cuba, where U.S. authorities have been interviewing
detained Al Qaeda operatives, and in Afghanistan, where the U.S. military
has been sifting through material left in the rubble by Al Qaeda forces,
law enforcement officials said.</TE>
<TE>   A detainee recently flown to Guantanamo Bay from Afghanistan told
American investigators about someone in Afghanistan whose brother
mentioned "an imminent attack on the 12th," said a U.S. official who
asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   The warning was issued on the fourth day of the Winter Olympics, which
are taking place in Salt Lake City amid extraordinarily tight security
measures.</TE>
<TE>   The alert, issued to 18,000 law enforcement agencies and the public at
large, read: "Recent information indicates a planned attack may occur in
the United States or against U.S. interests in the country of Yemen on or
around 02/12/02. One or more operatives may be involved in the attack."
It is posted on the FBI Web site, http://www.fbi.gov.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Rabeei's whereabouts are unknown, and law enforcement officials
said he is not believed to have shown up on any of the watch lists that
the FBI and other agencies have been using to track suspected terrorists
since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for California Gov. Gray Davis said the governor's office
passed the warning on to California law enforcement officials Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "In the wake of this latest FBI alert, California law enforcement
officials continue to be on high alert. Since receiving notice from the
FBI, we have notified all California law enforcement of the threat with
names of suspects via the California Anti-Terrorism network," said Steven
Maviglio, the governor's press secretary.</TE>
<TE>   "No other actions are being taken at this time."</TE>
<TE>   At the center of the FBI alert is Al-Rabeei, who may also use the name
Furqan or numerous other aliases. He and as many as 16 associates are
considered "extremely dangerous," the FBI said. The agency urged local
police to be on the lookout for any members of the group.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI posted photos of 13 of the suspects on its Web site. The
photos appear to be standard passport photos; all but three of the 17
suspects are believed to carry Yemeni passports.</TE>
<TE>Information Gathering Suggests Al Qaeda Link</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's warning drew no direct link between Al-Rabeei and Al Qaeda,
but the fact that the directive was triggered by information gathered in
Al Qaeda interrogations strongly suggests that he may be associated with
Osama bin Laden's terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know if the target is in the United States or against U.S.
interests or somewhere else," said the U.S. official. "We think Yemen is
a possibility, but it's really not clear."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has been probing Yemen terrorist connections more aggressively
in recent weeks, and President Bush spoke by phone Monday with Yemeni
President Ali Abdullah Saleh to review progress in the U.S.-led war on
terrorism. It was not clear whether the two leaders also discussed the
tip that led to the FBI warning.</TE>
<TE>   Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said early Monday that
Bush "expressed appreciation for the Saleh government's recent efforts to
deny terrorists use of Yemeni territory. The two agreed on the need for a
sustained effort and continued cooperation in the fight against the
terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's call followed a visit Monday to Yemen by Gen. Tommy Franks,
head of the U.S. Central Command, which is running the war in
Afghanistan. Franks told reporters there that the Bush administration
does not expect to deploy combat troops in Yemen but will help the
government by providing training and other assistance.</TE>
<TE>   A team of Yemeni investigators flew to Guantanamo Bay last week to
help interrogate 21 Yemenis who have been detained for their suspected
links to Al Qaeda or other terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   The Yemeni team includes investigators who are working on the
still-unsolved attack on the U.S. Navy destroyer Cole by a squad of
suicide bombers in October 2000 in the harbor of Aden. The attack killed
17 U.S. sailors.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. blames Al Qaeda for that bombing and the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Yemen's government also has launched a series of armed raids in recent
weeks in an attempt to capture two senior Al Qaeda operatives, including
one man wanted for the Cole attack. In one clash, 18 soldiers and six
local villagers were slain.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI, which drew criticism from some police for putting out past
alerts to the public before sharing them with law enforcement officials,
made a point of sending Monday's warning to law enforcement agencies
several hours before it went public.</TE>
<TE>Authorities Try to Corroborate Threat</TE>
<TE>   While authorities are still seeking to corroborate the intelligence
pointing to the prospect of a an attack today, "we wanted to get as much
information out as quickly as we could," an official said.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the Los
Angeles Police Department said their officers have been on heightened
alert since Sept. 11 and that no extra measures would be taken as a
result of the new warning because it was too general.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't done anything because there's nothing the FBI is giving us
that is specific enough to tell us where this is going to occur," said
Sheriff's Deputy Ron Bottomley. "Our officers are always on alert since
9/11."</TE>

<DH>Olympics: The American team turns in an 'awesome' triple play in
the men's snowboarding halfpipe event.</DH>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>The red, white and blue Games of Salt Lake City added gold, silver
and bronze to the color scheme here Monday when the young U.S. men's
snowboarding team swept their sport's marquee event.</LD>
<LD>   The sweep was the first by an American Winter Olympic team since 1956,
taking place before a wildly enthusiastic home crowd that swelled to as
many as 30,000 when the morning women's downhill event was postponed by
high winds. The trio of Ross Powers, Danny Kass and Jarret Thomas also
succeeded in bringing an Olympic fringe sport into the mainstream.</LD>
<LD>   "With everything that has happened to our country, this is huge," said
Powers, the 23-year-old gold medalist from South Londonderry, Vt. "It's
awesome."</LD>
<TE>   Awesome was not only the vernacular of the day in this sport of the
young and gnarly, but also a description of the performances and the
post-competition scene.</TE>
<TE>   Powers was the fourth competitor to go out in the halfpipe event, and
when he made his first push above the pipe and soared 15 feet high, the
crowds went wild. Kass, 19, from Hamburg, N.J., tried a corkscrew spin
and two upside-down twists but was 3.6 points behind Powers' 46.1--but
enough to get the silver. Thomas, 20, of Golden, Colo., was superb with a
2 1/2 spin and height nearly equal to Powers'. That earned him a 42.1,
four-tenths behind Kass and just one-tenth in front of Italian Giacomo
Kratter for the bronze.</TE>
<TE>   America's last such sweep took place in Cortina, Italy, when Hayes
Alan Jenkins, Ronnie Robertson and David Jenkins took all the medals in
figure skating.</TE>
<TE>   It also pushed the United States medal total to six--four of them in
snowboarding after Kelly Clark's gold Sunday in the women's halfpipe--and
made overall American medal success in these Games likely.</TE>
<TE>   The best United States medal efforts during the Winter Games was the
13 won in 1994 in Lillehammer and in '98 in Nagano.</TE>
<TE>   When the U.S. won just six in the '88 Games in Calgary, the U.S
Olympic Committee faced much criticism. Commissions were appointed to
solve the problem and more money was spent on Winter Olympic athletes,
leading to projections that the U.S. would win 20 medals in these Winter
Games.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest winner of the Games for the U.S. may be snowboarding.</TE>
<TE>   That is only appropriate, fans say, considering the sport was born in
the U.S. in the 1980s when someone decided zipping down a mountain would
be more fun anchored to one wide board instead of two skis.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the sport has had to fight the stereotype of teenage surf
or skateboard rats let loose on the slopes, complete with baggy, saggy
pants, outlandish hats and a language all their own. That reputation
wasn't helped by boarders' penchant for buzzing skiers while shredding
the mountainsides, or for the flap caused when a snowboarding gold
medalist tested positive for marijuana at the Nagano Games.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, that reputation has changed in recent years. Now, industry
analysts say, Baby Boomers who once held disdain for the sport that was
largely the domain of a younger generation are now trying it, much to the
amusement of boarders, who refer to them as "grays on trays."</TE>
<TE>   Its popularity is particularly on the rise in the Pacific West, where
boarders represented nearly 42% of ski resort visitors last year,
industry experts say.</TE>
<TE>   That trend is likely to continue, especially with the likes of Powers
serving as the self-appointed ambassador of the sport.</TE>
<TE>   "This is huge for snowboarding, awesome," said Powers, who held his
board high over his head on the top rung of the victory stand and then
invited Kass and Thomas to join him. Powers signed autographs for anybody
willing to wait, signed tickets, even an American flag. And when one
youngster asked for his goggles, Powers tossed them to him.</TE>
<TE>   Lost slightly in the American snowboard sweep was the quest of German
Luger Georg Hackl to become the first Winter Olympian to win a gold medal
in four straight Games. Hackl did not, but when he took a silver behind
Armin Zoeggler of Italy, he still had achieved the first of a medal in
his fifth Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Ten-time World Cup champion Markus Prock of Austria took the bronze
and American Adam Heidt, while extending the U.S. drought of never
winning a medal in luge, finished fourth, his country's best ever.</TE>
<TE>   Hackl, at 35 the most successful luge competitor ever, was not the
least bit upset.</TE>
<TE>   "Second place is where I belong," he said. "Armin is the right Olympic
champion."</TE>
<TE>   With the marque women's downhill postponed by high winds and the pairs
figure skating medal to be determined that night, just two other medal
events took place.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Henkel, 24, of Germany won the women's 15-kilometer biathlon
(skiing and shooting) and Ole Einar Bjoerndalen of Norway won the men's
20K biathlon, defending his Nagano title. Jeremy Teela of Anchorage
finished 14th, matching the best-ever American performances by John
Burritt in 1960 and Peter Karns in 1972. The U.S. women did not fare as
well, Rachel Steer of Anchorage doing the best at 31st.</TE>
<TE>   In the first half of the two-day men's 500 speed skating event, Casey
FitzRandolph of Verona, Wis., posted the fastest time, outracing
defending champion Hiroyasu Shimizu of Japan. Shimizu's world record is
34.32 seconds. FitzRandolph set an Olympic record with 34.42 and Shimizu
was second with 34.61. Kip Carpenter, a 22-year-old from Brookfield,
Wis., had never skated under 35 seconds, but his 34.68 was good enough
for third, going into today's second and final round.</TE>
<TE>   In curling, the United States team posted an upset in the qualifying
tournament when it beat Sweden, the gold medalist from Nagano, 10-5. Tim
Somerville of Roseville, Minn., made the clinching shot. And in women's
hockey, Canada won the first game of the tournament, beating Kazakhstan,
7-0. The Kazakhstan goalie, Natalya Trunova, was bombarded and forced to
make 59 saves to keep the score respectable.</TE>
<TE>   Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze extended Russia's dominance of
Olympic pairs figure skating Monday night by the slimmest of margins over
Canada's Jamie Sale and David Pelletier.</TE>
<TE>   The Russians collected seven 5.9s for artistry, enough to give their
nation its 11th straight gold medal, dating to 1964. Sale and Pelletier
earned the silver medal and China's Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo won the
bronze.</TE>
<TE>   American champions Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman finished fifth but
said the performance was "the greatest thing we've ever done."</TE>

to Rod Serling at the Museum of Television &amp; Radio correctly identified
on first reference his "A Town Has Turned to Dust" as an episode of
"Playhouse 90" but on second reference mistakenly indicated that it was
an episode of "The Twilight Zone." In addition, the story incorrectly
suggested that "Mr. Denton on Doomsday" was the first episode of "The
Twilight Zone" to be broadcast. It was the third.</LD>

<HD>Wanted: Rock Star (No Experience Needed)</HD>
<DH>Music: Limp Bizkit invites all comers to try out as the
popular band's new guitarist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They stood in line, these 315 guitarists, like so many
rosary-clutching supplicants seeking an audience with the pope. Yet
deep down they knew they were more like six-string-wielding lambs to
the slaughter.</LD>
<LD>   Each patiently waited his or her turn Monday at the Guitar Center
in Hollywood for that one brief, shining moment (in this case,
roughly 60 seconds): a shot at wowing the members of hard-rock band
Limp Bizkit.</LD>
<LD>   The band, which has sold more than 16 million albums in the last
five years with its aggressive musical style, says it is hoping to
hire its new guitar player through an audition process in which
professional experience is neither necessary nor even desired.</LD>
<TE>   Of roughly 5,000 musicians who have showed up since the tryouts
began in Fresno last month, one may win that spot. The band isn't
guaranteeing it will anoint any of them after the last barre chord
has faded to silence. Still, those odds struck most of the comers as
far better than hitting the lottery.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm in there," said Phil Lopez, 33, who had driven from
Rancho Cucamonga, one of 600 guitarists who turned up at the Sunset
Boulevard store. The first 315 were allowed into the pre-audition; of
those, a handful were to be selected to jam with the band during the
evening's final session.</TE>
<TE>   "I must have practiced my stuff 300 times," said Lopez, who said
he is in the automotive business and at one time had been part of a
band. "A lot of guys just played one
riff--chunka-chunka-chunka-chunka--</TE>
<TE>   but I knew they wanted to hear something different. If anybody
gets called back to play with tonight, I'm sure it'll be me."</TE>
<TE>   'I Think I've Got a Shot'</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing is just being a part of this," said Jerry
Gurrola, 25, of South Gate, with a "#167" inked on the back of his
right hand in black marker to show his place in line.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I've got a shot," said Gurrola, who works in a warehouse
and plays in bands that pay tribute to Jimi Hendrix and Black
Sabbath. "There is a lot of competition, but the thing that's cool is
that if I don't make it, then I'll know that the guy they do pick
really deserves it. And if I don't make it, then that's just
motivation for me to get better."</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of hopefuls like Lopez and Gurrola, from teens to
fortysomethings, most toting battered brown Gibson cases or with
sleek black Fender gig bags over their shoulders, turned out for the
final stop on a 22-city tour. It's Limp Bizkit's way of holding out
the brass ring to guitarists around the country, if not the Western
Hemisphere, to fill the vacancy that occurred when Wes Borland quit
last fall.</TE>
<TE>   The overwhelmingly male crowd was a remarkably diverse-looking
bunch, some with straight, long hair and faded blue jeans, others
outfitted in camouflage and sporting punkish dyed spikes, still
others with a clean-cut GQ look.</TE>
<TE>   All they had in common was the sturdy ego that seems to be part of
every rock guitarist's standard equipment--and a willingness to go
down in flames.</TE>
<TE>   One complained that he was rebuked when he made a move to change
the dials on one of the rehearsal room amplifiers. Another smarted
from being cut off mid-solo when he ran over the time limit.</TE>
<TE>   After Borland quit the band, declaring he wanted to get back to
making music, not just money, the remaining members decided to open
the spot to a young unknown. They happily brushed off any skeptics
who suggested the whole campaign was a scheme to keep Bizkit's name
before the public in the lull between albums.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't said we're definitely going to pick somebody out of
these auditions," said Limp Bizkit road manager Yeti Ward. "Every day
we run into somebody saying, 'C'mon, you guys aren't really going to
choose one of these guys, are you?' I wouldn't be sitting in Oklahoma
City if we weren't really looking for somebody."</TE>
<TE>   Said singer Fred Durst: "I hope we find somebody. I really hope we
do. But you can't force it. It's like if I were looking for my
soulmate and I was going on 4,000 dates in one month. I might find
her, but I might not. It's more the vibe. There's no technical skill
level we're looking for. I'll know when it happens, but it hasn't
happened yet."</TE>
<TE>   The band has no specific timeline for announcing audition results
but Durst says members are eager to go to work on a new album.</TE>
<TE>   Chance for Someone's Dream to Come True</TE>
<TE>   The band came up with the unusual "every guy" approach because
Durst and the rest of Limp Bizkit remember when they were "a bunch of
nobodies" in Jacksonville, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   "So while they are looking for somebody who has a unique way of
playing that can bring something different to the band, at the same
time they want to give some musician their ultimate dream."</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen-year-old Chris Romero of Ventura liked the odds.</TE>
<TE>   "Definitely better than hitting the lottery," he said. "Besides,
with the lottery it's just luck. This is skill.... I'd like to think
they really are going to pick someone from the auditions. But like my
dad told me, 'Just go and see what it's like and don't get your hopes
up.'"</TE>
<TE>   In at least one case, quantity was as much a factor in applicants'
hopes as quality.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Morgan came from Durham, N.C., with his seven-string guitar,
akin to the customized instrument Borland played. He was accompanied
by a friend, Carlos Ollervides, who was convinced Morgan's instrument
gave him an inside track.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would they want to go down in quality [by choosing a
six-string player]?" Ollervides asked from their spot on the sidewalk
near the end of the line. "They won't."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the band chose three musicians to jam with Limp Bizkit
in front of several dozen people inside the guitar store Monday
night: Jonas Anderson, 25, of Fresno; Monte Pittman, 26, who lives
about a block from the Guitar Center, and Anoush Saboktakin of West
Hollywood, who was the 300th guitarist in line.</TE>
<TE>   It was impossible to gauge Saboktakin's age. He listed his
birthdate on his application form as summer 2002.</TE>

<HD>New Version Will Replace Pulled Koran</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A translation of the Koran with several controversial footnotes and
commentaries that offended some Jews will be permanently removed from
Los Angeles public school libraries and replaced with a less
objectionable version, according to an agreement reached Monday.</LD>
<LD>   A panel of Islamic experts and other educators will review
potential substitutes for the nearly 300 copies of the 1934 book "The
Meaning of the Holy Quran," which were donated last month by a local
Islamic foundation to the Los Angeles Unified School District. School
officials last week took the books from shelves pending Monday's
meeting with Muslim and Jewish leaders.</LD>
<LD>   Dafer Dakhil, head of the Omar Ibn Khattab Foundation, which
donated the books, agreed to their permanent withdrawal and said
Monday that he did not mean to "hurt the feelings or cause discomfort
to members of other faiths."</LD>
<TE>   The books triggered a debate about the role of various religious
scriptures in public education and how best to explain ancient texts
that may make disparaging remarks about other cultures or religions.</TE>
<TE>   All sides praised Monday's settlement and some participants
suggested it was a sign that tensions may have cooled since a series
of disputes between local Jewish and Muslim groups.</TE>
<TE>   "In the interest of good faith and goodwill and being sensitive to
people's concerns we agreed that the books should not be used," said
Salam Al-Marayati, spokesman for the Muslim Public Affairs Council.</TE>
<TE>   Dakhil started Monday's closed-door meeting at district offices by
apologizing for any offense he might have caused, according to
participant Michael Hirschfeld, executive director of the Jewish
Community Relations Committee of the Los Angeles Jewish Federation.</TE>
<TE>   "His sincerity was very apparent," Hirschfeld said. "He recognized
it as a mistake and was interested in doing whatever possible to
bridge differences."</TE>
<TE>   Dakhil, a fixture at regular district Board of Education meetings,
donates space to the district at the foundation's offices near USC
and provides free workshops for teachers interested in learning more
about Islamic culture, history and the Koran, which some Muslims
prefer to be spelled Quran.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to be interviewed in detail in person or by telephone.
But in an e-mail response to questions posed by The Times, Dakhil
said, "The purpose of our gift was [to] promote greater understanding
of Islam and Muslims at a time when misconceptions and interest about
Islam and [Muslims are] at a peak; and to provide educators and
students an opportunity to use the Quran alongside the Bible and
scriptures of other faiths."</TE>
<TE>   Al-Marayati of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, in an interview
after the meeting, pointed out that many religious books, including
the Jewish Torah and the New Testament, have passages that are less
than politically correct in references to other groups.</TE>
<TE>   He and other Muslims at the meeting agreed to work with school
officials to find another version of the Koran as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Rowena Lagrosa, L.A. Unified's executive administrator of
educational services, said the meeting reaffirmed the district's good
relationship with Dakhil's foundation, but she acknowledged that the
translation in question "did not go through the normal district
review procedures."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the district distributed the books to middle and
high schools two weeks ago, a history teacher complained about
references that seemed to be anti-Jewish.</TE>
<TE>   One of the objectionable footnotes, for example, said: "The Jews
in their arrogance claimed that all wisdom and all knowledge of Allah
was enclosed in their hearts. But there were more things in heaven
and earth than were dreamt of in their philosophy. Their claim was
not only arrogance but blasphemy."</TE>
<TE>   Most Popular English Translation of Koran</TE>
<TE>   "The Meaning of the Holy Quran" is the most popular English
translation of Islam's sacred scripture, say scholars. Ahmed Osman of
Amana Publications in Beltsville, Md., said his company sells
millions of copies each year throughout the world and has never
before heard complaints about the book.</TE>
<TE>   But he acknowledged that "a translation is an interpretation," and
that author Abdullah Yusef Ali brought his own perspective to the
book.</TE>
<TE>   According to Osman, Ali was a native of British colonial India who
memorized the entire Koran in Arabic at age 8.</TE>
<TE>   He became a highly regarded scholar known for his mastery of
Islam, along with his knowledge of Christian and Jewish texts--and
the English language.</TE>
<TE>   Ali Asani, an Islamic scholar at Harvard University, said that
Koranic commentaries often reflect "particular political goals," and
that Ali's perspective might have been colored by his experience in
colonial India when many Muslims felt they had to resist encroachment
by other cultures.</TE>
<TE>   Asani, in a telephone interview, also said that other translations
better reflect more pluralistic elements in the Koran, which has many
passages praising Jews and Christians as "the people of the book."</TE>
<TE>   The flap follows several months of tense relations between
Southern California Jews and Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   Those include the arrest of longtime Jewish Defense League's
leader Irv Rubin on charges that he planned to bomb the King Fahd
mosque in Culver City.</TE>
<TE>   And some Jewish leaders condemned Al-Marayati for his sarcastic
statement before the perpetrators were identified that the Israeli
government was just as likely to have blown up the World Trade Center
as Muslims.</TE>

<LD>Former Soviets--Ukrainian Viktor Petrenko and Russians Alexei Urmanov
and Ilia Kulik--have won the last three Olympic men's titles. The
streak is expected to continue this year with Russians Alexei Yagudin
and Evgeny Plushenko vying for the gold medal.</LD>
<LD>   Yagudin, fifth in the 1998 Winter Games, won world championships
in 1998, '99 and 2000, but Plushenko won last year. Vowing to come
back, perhaps so that he can again partake in the victory
celebrations that he reportedly relishes, Yagudin appears to have
regained the edge this season. We'll know more after tonight's short
program, which counts for one-third of the final score.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. champion is Todd Eldredge, who is competing in his third
Olympics. He is known as "No Quad" Todd because he is the only
contender who doesn't consistently include a quadruple jump in his
programs. But he is steady and could benefit if everyone else
crashes. The other Americans, Timothy Goebel and Michael Weiss, are
also considered bronze-medal contenders.</LD>

<LD>Jonny Moseley is back to defend his title from 1998 in the men's
moguls final, but some of the acrobatic air has gone out from
underneath his skis in the last four years. He and his patented
"Dinner Roll" barely made the U.S. team.</LD>
<LD>   Jeremy Bloom, who delayed his college football career at Colorado
to prepare for the Olympics, is the best American hope. He comes here
leading the World Cup moguls standings.</LD>
<LD>   Finns are favored. Janne Lahtela, who finished second to Moseley
in Nagano, won the overall World Cup titles in 1999 and 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Mikko Ronkainen won last year. Sami Mustonen finished third in
Nagano and was second to Lahtela in the 2000 World Cup standings.</TE>

<HD>Hockey Is Teen's Passion</HD>

<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Teenage girls in figure skates at the Olympic Games are supposed to
wear sequined outfits and perform toe loops and salchows.</LD>
<LD>   Sixteen-year-old Lyndsay Wall wears skates. And pads and a helmet.
She's a defenseman on the U.S. women's hockey team.</LD>
<LD>   She leaves the frilly things to others. Like her sister Ashley,
who prefers gymnastics and "girly stuff", according to their father,
Kraig. After six months of checks and slap shots, Lyndsay will
probably pass on her junior prom this spring. Hockey's her passion.
Has been ever since she was 5 and Kraig gave her some sticks.</LD>
<TE>   "He just thought I was really energetic and rough and tough, so he
thought to throw me into hockey," Wall said.</TE>
<TE>   Now the family is about to enjoy the reward. It's payback for the
dents and holes Wall put in the garage door of their home in
Churchville, N.Y., from firing slap shots, in addition to the damage
inflicted on the basement walls from playing inside on rainy days.
It's a reward for the early morning practices, for the years of
competing against boys, one of whom broke her collarbone when she was
13.</TE>
<TE>   She's part of the 20-player U.S. women's team, that begins defense
of its 1998 gold medal today against Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Already, the Olympics have been special. She met President Bush,
Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong and baseball iron man Cal
Ripken before the opening ceremonies on Friday, then heard the crowd
roar when the United States was announced and she marched into the
stadium during the parade of nations.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a great experience, especially for someone my age,"
Wall said. "To be able to say that I'm in the Olympics, I went to
opening ceremonies, I got to meet those people ... that's something
that every 16-year-old doesn't say."</TE>
<TE>   "We feel a lot of pride," her mother, Sandra Wall, said.
"Especially [because of] her age. We're still in shock."</TE>
<TE>   Wall impressed Olympic Coach Ben Smith with her play at the USA
Hockey women's development camps last July, and he invited her to the
women's national tryouts at Lake Placid, N.Y., the next month. She
made the 25-woman roster.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I was like, 'I might have a chance for this,'" Wall said.
"My confidence level really started to build."</TE>
<TE>   She survived the trim to 20 players in December and wound up
playing in 23 games during the team's 31-game pre-Olympic tour. She
has been home only twice since August, living a life of practice and
travel.</TE>
<TE>   So Wall must have always been a mature person to handle such a
rigorous, adult-like lifestyle, right?</TE>
<TE>   "Uh, no," her mother said. "She's grown up a lot. When you're
hanging out with 30-year-olds and you're 16, you can't act your age."</TE>
<TE>   "You have to take care of yourself," Lyndsay said. "You don't have
your mother to pick up your clothes or do your laundry. You have to
remember to do your homework, stuff like that. I have to do it all on
my own, you know?"</TE>
<TE>   Wall is taking English and American history classes from
Churchville-Chili High School through the Internet, replying to
teachers' questions via e-mail. She's getting a cultural education as
well, with experiences such as a trip to the Great Wall of China when
the U.S. women played the Chinese national team.</TE>
<TE>   Her teammates say she fits in, even if at times she does betray
her age. The team packed plenty of its own food for overseas trips;
Wall's stash included Pringles and Ho-Ho's.</TE>
<TE>   Wall is part of a youthful contingent that has provided a nice
blend to a team that returns 14 players from the group that won the
first women's hockey tournament in Nagano, Japan, four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "They bounce off the walls, those guys," said Cammi Granato, 30.
"Julie Chu [19] has more energy than my four-year old niece. She
wakes up with a smile on her face, goes to bed with a smile on her
face. She brings that excitement and energy. Lyndsay Wall doesn't
even have her license yet. Natalie [Darwitz, 18] and Krissy
[Wendelll, 20] are always dancing and singing. Those guys definitely
bring a fresh attitude and some high energy."</TE>
<TE>   The Americans are also revitalized by finally reaching the real
competition. They won all 31 games on their pre-Olympic tour.</TE>
<TE>   "We're the defending champions and it's in the United Sates and
all that stuff," said goaltender Sarah Tueting, who will alternate
with Sara DeCosta during the games. "We know the reasons why the
pressure's there, but we also know we're in control of whether we let
it affect us.</TE>
<TE>   "We would be stupid and foolish to overlook anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Finland, which won the bronze in Nagano and finished third in six
of the seven women's World Championships, is the biggest threat among
the three other teams in the United States' preliminary round group.
They wouldn't face Canada until the medal round.</TE>
<TE>   For Wall, the hardest part might not be the Olympic competition.
It might be the return to high school life.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to be used to getting up at 6:30 in the morning and
going to school," Wall said. "I'm going to be used to hanging out,
eating whatever I want. Just doing like a grownup does."</TE>

<KH>BIATHLON</KH>
<HD>On Many Levels, Athletes and Fans Give It Their Best Shot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEW FREEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TRIBUNE OLYMPIC BUREAU</BD>
<DL>MIDWAY, Utah</DL>
<LD>It was as if someone with a gigantic crane uprooted and transported
an entire European biathlon stage across the Atlantic Ocean and then
brick by brick reassembled it to provide a day of great theater.</LD>
<LD>   Biathlon was invented by Norwegians and perfected with some help
from neighboring Sweden, but such an atmosphere was unheard of for
the United States. Monday, the Soldier Hollow venue for the 2002
Winter Olympics might as well have been Oslo or Stockholm.</LD>
<LD>   There were 8,500 spectators sitting and standing in the sunshine
and about an equal number seemed to be waving flags. Just about as
many Norwegian and Swedish flags as American banners.</LD>
<TE>   Though the only guys doing the NFL thing and painting their faces
with symbols of their country seemed to be Norwegian. Of course,
biathlon is as big in Norway as football is in the U.S., so it was
only fitting.</TE>
<TE>   On a day that may have seen the best-ever American men's Olympic
showing--and foreshadowed an even better week ahead--the Norwegians
certainly received their payoff. Already a national hero from his
1998 Olympic gold medal performance and his multiple World
Championship medals, Ole Einar Bjoerndalen won the men's 20-kilometer
gold medal in 49 minutes, 3.3 seconds. And Liv Grete Poiree won the
silver medal in the women's 15 kilometer.</TE>
<TE>   But it was really a United Nations celebration. Andrea Henkel of
Germany won the women's race in 47:29.1, and Magdalena Forsberg of
Sweden at last won an Olympic medal, taking the bronze. Forsberg has
won the last five World Cup titles but had never done well in the
Olympics. Until she missed two targets in her final shooting round.
she had gold in her sights.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I did very well except for the two shots I missed,"
Forsberg said. "I'm very happy to win the bronze medal. My legs were
so shaky--that happens when you ski hard on the tracks. But of course
it's also a combination of pressure and of being nervous."</TE>
<TE>   Biathlon combines shooting accuracy--aiming a .22-caliber rifle at
4-centimeter-wide targets 50 meters away--and cross-country skiing.
The athletes must ski as hard as they can, then try to will their
heartbeats down to a manageable level when they shoot.</TE>
<TE>   Americans have never won an Olympic medal, but the way the fans
responded you might have thought it was the World Series. There is no
real history of crowd turnout and enthusiasm for the sport in the
U.S., but most Europeans felt at home too.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe there is more sophisticated cheering. The loudest shouts
follow clean shots. The Norwegians emulated that style here. Forsberg
said the energy from fans was palpable, but they cheered differently.</TE>
<TE>   "In America," she said, "they scream all the time."</TE>
<TE>   American biathlon had quite a bit to scream about Monday. U.S.
fans decorated the whole neighborhood except the course backdrop wall
of snow featuring turquoise Olympic rings that resembled a big
frosted cake baked for the occasion. Friends and family members made
banners. That was all visual, but the decibel level caught American
racers off guard.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Teela of Anchorage, Alaska, and an Army specialist who is a
member of the service's World Class Athlete Program, placed 14th,
equaling the top finish of any American ever in an Olympics, and Jay
Hakkinen of Kasilof, Alaska, placed 26th. Bjoerndalen, who also raced
in the 30-kilometer cross-country event for Norway on Saturday, edged
Frank Luck of Germany, who won silver, and Victor Maigourov of
Russia, who took bronze, but the real shock was Teela's finish.
Teela, 25, didn't feel sharp, and although he made 18 of 20 shots
prone and standing, he didn't think he skied well. He and Hakkinen
consider Wednesday's 10-kilometer sprint their best event--and the
nation's best chance for a top 10 or a historic medal.</TE>
<TE>   At the opening ceremony, Teela was seated near President Bush--and
he is one of the athletes who passed his cell phone to the president
to chat with his girlfriend. Ninth in the world championship sprint
in 2001, Teela said he would be nowhere without the Army's program.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels good to represent all the soldiers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And he knows the noise will increase, flags will be waved more
vigorously, and that he will feel even better if he represents the
Army into the medals.</TE>

<HD>This Is Kinder, Gentler Brooks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Herb Brooks was famous in 1980 for the stern lectures he delivered to
his team of impressionable, young college kids during the seven
months they prepared for the Lake Placid Games.</LD>
<LD>   This time, guiding NHL professionals for 10 days at most, Brooks
plans to do less talking and more listening.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think of this being a dictatorial type of thing," said
Brooks, whose team begins play Friday against Finland at the E
Center. "You try to pull it out of them, as opposed to putting it in.
You try and pull it out and make it an ownership-stake type of thing
for the players. Then you have a better chance of a cohesive locker
room."</LD>
<TE>   If this is a different Brooks, that's because these are decidedly
different times in Olympic hockey.</TE>
<TE>   The participation of NHL stars for the second time has changed the
tournament structure and made a quick bonding process imperative. The
six seeded teams--the U.S., Canada, Sweden, Finland, the Czech
Republic and Russia--will each have only one practice before their
openers. "If the U.S. is fortunate to win, it will be no miracle,"
Brooks said at a news conference Monday. "We're one of six teams
that's got a shot at it."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks is convinced the U.S. and Canada will be at a disadvantage
on the Olympic ice surface, which, at 200 feet long and 100 feet
wide, is 15 feet wider than NHL rinks.</TE>
<TE>   "We have more of a north-south [directional] mentality," he said.
"For Europeans, it's different. They know how to play east-west. They
know about cycling the puck. They know how to come back to the puck.
The Canadians and Americans will have to make that adjustment."</TE>
<TE>   Nor will the U.S. have the kind of home-continent advantage. "It's
not like going to a foreign country for anybody," Brooks said.</TE>
<TE>   As it was in the last U.S. men's Olympic successes, goaltending is
sure to be a pivotal factor for the U.S. in this tournament. Brooks
said Monday he hadn't settled on one starter and might rotate two of
the three goalies on the roster before deciding which to play again.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. goalies Mike Richter, Tom Barrasso and Mike Dunham have all
struggled at times this season, leading Brooks to joke that he'll
leave the decision to goaltending coach Warren Strelow and say,
"Don't screw up."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to sell people short, but I do recognize the great
goalkeepers that are here from the other countries," Brooks said. "I
don't want to hang our goalkeepers out there in case we don't do it.
There are other factors.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if you play smart and hard and do it with some class, you
should be able to sleep at night," he said.</TE>

<LD>The U.S. men split their opening day curling matches Monday,
including a 10-5 upset of world champion Sweden.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. skip Tim Somerville made a difficult shot to beat Sweden.
Leading, 4-3, in the seventh end, or inning, Somerville used an angle
shot to knock one stone into the Swedish stone and push them out of
scoring position.</LD>
<LD>   "It was like a 1-in-20 shot, but it was kind of the only one I
had," Somerville said. "I feel like I have won a medal already. But
there is still a long, long journey to go."</LD>

<LD>The women's Olympic downhill, billed as Picabo Street's last race,
was delayed a day when winds that gusted as high as 20 mph near the
top of the Wildflower course forced Monday's race to be postponed.</LD>
<LD>   The downhill was rescheduled for 9 a.m. PST today.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously it's safety first, then it's fairness second, so I know
they made the right decision," Street said. "Of course it's
disappointing because we all wanted to race. But I don't think the
Americans are going to have any problem getting up for tomorrow."</LD>
<TE>   Skier safety always takes priority in the Alpine speed events,
where skiers reach speeds in excess of 80 mph. The safety issue has
become more pronounced this season given the on-course death of
French skier Regine Cavagnoud and a crash that left Swiss skier
Silviano Beltrametti paralyzed.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Monday's decision to postpone the downhill also was
performance-related because the gusting winds may have benefited some
racers and hurt others.</TE>
<TE>   There was no hint of postponement Monday morning as thousands of
fans packed the grandstands under a cloudless sky, and it appeared as
though Street was going to run her final downhill under another lucky
star. She originally drew start position No. 2, the same bib number
she wore on her gold-medal run in super-giant slalom at the 1998
Nagano Games.</TE>
<TE>   In the rescheduled race, however, Street will race from the 26th
position. U.S. teammate Caroline Lalive drew the No. 2 bib for
today's race.</TE>

<HD>Sweeping Sensation</HD>
<DH>Led by Powers, American snowboarders take top three spots
in the men's halfpipe; first U.S. sweep since 1956.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON,</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>United States snowboarders made Olympic history Monday, recording the
first sweep in the men's halfpipe, a feat that cements snowboarding's
future and is further evidence that America is emerging as a winter
sports power.</LD>
<LD>   Ross Powers, 23, of South Londonberry, Vt., won the gold medal
with a ride featuring spectacular twists and spins accompanied by
huge chunks of hang time while soaring 15 feet above the lip of the
halfpipe--what riders call "big air."</LD>
<LD>   Danny Kass, 19, of Hamburg, N.J., perhaps the most inventive
halfpipe rider in the world, took the silver. Jarret [J.J.] Thomas,
20, of Golden, Colo, got the bronze. Tommy Czeschin, 22, of Mammoth
Lakes, finished sixth.</LD>
<TE>   Afterward, in an emotional reference to the Sept. 11 terror
attacks, Powers said, "After everything that's happened to us in the
States, it's huge....</TE>
<TE>   "To sweep it here, in our country, it's awesome."</TE>
<TE>   The last time the U.S. swept an event in the Winter Games was 1956
when the men's figure skating team, led by Hayes Jenkins, did it in
Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. now has six medals after three days of competition.
Officials with the U.S. Olympic team predicted Americans would win at
least 20 here.</TE>
<TE>   The most Americans have won in a Winter Games is 13, in 1998 at
Nagano, Japan, and in 1994 in Lillehammer, Norway.</TE>
<TE>   About a dozen years ago, U.S. Olympic officials embarked on a
multimillion-dollar program to boost American medal results at the
Winter Games--the U.S. was already traditionally strong in the Summer
Games--and said they expected the program to start paying off in
2002.</TE>
<TE>   "I wiggled my way up to the finish line so I could watch these
kids," U.S. Olympic Committee President Sandra Baldwin said. "We are
so proud of them."</TE>
<TE>   The medal sweep by the American men--in concert with a gold won
Sunday in the women's halfpipe by Kelly Clark--has given snowboarding
a boost of widespread publicity and reinforced the belief of those
who have long said it will become one of the glamour events of the
Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   A capacity crowd of at least 16,500 packed Park City Mountain
Resort for both the women's and the men's contests. Both events were
held in brilliant sunshine, with loud rock music playing over the
loudspeakers and a frenetic announcer delivering breathless
commentary; the audience cheered loudly and warmly for athletes from
all nations, louder still for the Americans. "The crowd was just
amazing," Kass said.</TE>
<TE>   The sweep promises to further propel snowboarding into mainstream
culture. Only a few savvy businesspeople are already in on the secret
that, for example, video games featuring--or endorsed by--star riders
translate into millions of dollars in sales.</TE>
<TE>   NBC, intent on tapping into the all-important 18-to-34 market,
delayed airing the men's halfpipe competition--which wrapped up
Monday about 3:30 p.m.--until prime time.</TE>
<TE>   The results guarantee "mainstream exposure to what's been going on
in snowboarding for a long time," said Jake Burton, one of the
sport's pioneers. "I don't think there's any sport that is
progressing the way this one is."</TE>
<TE>   All three medal winners are hard-working athletes fiercely devoted
to the sport and each boasts an engaging personality--the opposite of
the stereotype of snowboarders as dope-smoking slackers.</TE>
<TE>   That image can be traced in part to the 1998 Winter Games, when
Ross Rebagliati of Canada tested positive for marijuana after winning
gold in slalom racing. He ultimately got to keep the medal--officials
ruling there were no grounds to take it away--but the incident lent
credibility to the image of snowboarders as potheads.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't do drugs," Kass said Monday on his way to be tested.
"Drugs are bad."</TE>
<TE>   After he won, Powers--who months back launched a foundation aimed
at helping underprivileged athletes--patiently and graciously signed
autographs. He signed tickets, vests, flags--anything. And when fans
said, "Thank you," he said, "You're welcome." On his way out of the
stadium, he threw his goggles to a kid who had asked for them.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody loves snowboarding, and when you see a good show--wow!"
Thomas said. Just moments before, after his mother, Susan, and his
stepfather, Bob Ransome, told him how thrilled they were for him, he
confided he was happy but nonetheless hoped he hadn't disappointed
them by finishing third.</TE>
<TE>   "Sorry I sketched," he told them, using snowboarding lingo that
means "wasn't perfect."</TE>
<TE>   Kass, who trains in Mammoth Lakes, also had a cheering section. He
frequently travels with a crew of other young men and they can be
loud while trying incessantly to be funny. On Monday, that meant
bringing a blow-up doll (male version) to the stands. "The team
manager," Kass joked.</TE>
<TE>   But right next to his pals were 14 Kass relatives--Danny's father,
Craig; his stepmother, Lore; his mother; Joanne Thiem; a grandmother,
Irma Braunig, whom he calls "Oma"; and various cousins, nieces and
nephews. The scene looked like something out of a Saturday morning
youth soccer game.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Casillo, one of Kass' friends, said the medals "shows how
serious [U.S. snowboarders] are," adding, "These colors don't run."</TE>

<LD>Where do I begin ...</LD>
<LD>   to tell the story of ...</LD>
<LD>   the end of civilization as we know it?</LD>
<TE>   Like a mosquito to one of those backyard zapping devices, I was
drawn to the Winter Olympic figure skating pairs finals Monday night.
I sensed that we were on the edge of the apocalypse.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't because a gold medal winning streak--either Soviets or
Russians have finished first in pairs in each Olympics since
1964--was in jeopardy. As winning streaks go, that one doesn't
resonate in Los Angeles quite like the Lakers' 33 consecutive
victories or UCLA's seven consecutive NCAA basketball titles.</TE>
<TE>   No, ominous clouds were gathering over the Salt Lake Ice Center
because of the favored Canadians' choice of music for their freestyle
program.</TE>
<TE>   The Russians, with their classical upbringings, have over the
years brought the best traditions of the Bolshoi and Kirov theaters
to figure skating.</TE>
<TE>   When the Protopopovs won the pairs in 1964 in Innsbruck, Austria,
and '68 in Grenoble, France, they skated to music such as
"Meditations" from Jules Massenet's opera "Thais."</TE>
<TE>   Natalia Mishkutenok and Artur Dmitriev won in 1992 in Albertville,
France, to "Liebestraume." Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov, who
won in 1988 with a program combining Chopin and Mendelssohn, used
Beethoven's "Moonlight Serenade" to win in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian team of Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze,
leading after Saturday night's technical program, came full circle in
the long program, skating to "Meditations."</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian pair of Jamie Sale and David Pelletier, second after
the technical program but still considered the favorites by many,
skated to the theme from "Love Story."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am often reminded when I make reference to a cultural touchstone
from my youth ("Easy Rider," Boz Scaggs, "Harry O") that not all of
you were as aware as I was--or even alive--during the '60s and '70s.</TE>
<TE>   So maybe you missed "Love Story," the book, the movie and the
song, the last of which actually was titled, "Where Do I Begin?"</TE>
<TE>   As advertised by Bantam Books, Erich Segal's novel is "the
wonderful, tumultuous, heartfelt story of Oliver Barrett IV and Jenny
Cavilleri--the story of a rich Harvard jock and a wisecracking
Radcliffe music major who have nothing in common but love ... and
everything else to share but time."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe. I didn't read the book.</TE>
<TE>   But I can tell you that the "All Movie Guide" is dead on in this
appraisal of the 1970 film starring Ryan O'Neal and Ali McGraw:</TE>
<TE>   "Despite financial travails (the pampered Oliver actually has to
go to work!) the couple is blissfully happy ... until Jenny is
diagnosed as having a disease that consigns the victim to an early
death, but which leaves said victim looking like a million bucks even
on the brink of eternity."</TE>
<TE>   As my wife can tell you, I tear up at least twice a night while
watching television. "Touched by an Angel" gets to me every time. I
even cry when Kenny dies in "South Park," and that occurs at least
once every episode.</TE>
<TE>   I left the theater after seeing "Love Story" as dry-eyed as if I
had been watching the evening news.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The theme song, composed by Frenchman Francis Lai, was every bit
as sappy as the movie, and you wouldn't have heard a complaint from
me if I had never heard it again. And then came the pairs final
Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   As they would say in the "South Park" movie, "Blame Canada."</TE>
<TE>   Sale and Pelletier used "Love Story" in 1999, mercifully ditched
it and then were actually prodded by many to reprise it for their
Olympic campaign. I guess there is no accounting for taste. One
figure skating writer the other day referred to the program as
"wildly popular," which suggests that we haven't come far as a
society in 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   I fear for the future. The tasteful Russians are on the wane in
pairs figure skating. Sports authorities in the Soviet Union used to
steer the best skaters into pairs and dance. Today, the skaters
themselves make the decisions, and most of them, like Americans,
prefer to compete in singles. Collectivism is out. Individualism is
in.</TE>
<TE>   Tamara Moskvina, the legendary pairs coach from St. Petersburg,
Russia, has moved to New Jersey. She still coaches Berezhnaya and
Sikharulidze there. But she also is coaching Americans--including
Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman, who entered Monday night's competition
in fifth place--and sees firsthand that standards</TE>
<TE>   are not as high everywhere</TE>
<TE>   in the sport as they were in</TE>
<TE>   Russia.</TE>
<TE>   After the efficient but less-than-sparkling performance of
Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze in the technical program, Moskvina said:
"Americans in such case would say, 'Tremendous, beautiful,
unbelievable.' What else? 'Amazing.' We Russians, we say, 'OK.'"</TE>
<TE>   The standard is slipping for music too.</TE>
<TE>   If the Canadians can become gold medal contenders with "Love
Story," what's next?</TE>
<TE>   "Feelings"?</TE>
<TE>   "Mandy"?</TE>
<TE>   Shame on the Canadians. Winning a medal doesn't mean you never
have to say you're sorry.</TE>

<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Valentyn Oletsky scored two goals Monday for Ukraine, which kept
alive its hopes for advancement from the Olympic men's hockey
preliminary round with a 5-2 victory over Switzerland.</LD>
<LD>   Looking completely changed from the undisciplined team that was
shut out by Belarus in its first game, Ukraine (1-1-0) relentlessly
hit and attacked in a victory that likely eliminated the Swiss
(0-1-1), the pre-tournament favorites in Group B.</LD>
<LD>   In perhaps the most physical game of the tournament, both teams
played tight-checking, bad-tempered hockey, with several minor
skirmishes and even a first-period fight with actual punches -- a
rarity in international play.</LD>
<TE>   Switzerland was thought most likely to advance from the weaker of
the two preliminary round groups because of its commitment to team
play, but the Swiss, who tied France in their first game, simply
couldn't match Ukraine's physical play.</TE>
<TE>   Ukraine got a boost with the addition of two NHL players -- St.
Louis' Sergei Varlamov and Philadelphia's Ruslan Fedetenko.</TE>
<TE>   Oletsky got the lead for Ukraine just 2:08 in when he put his own
rebound past Colorado Avalanche backup goalie David Aebischer.</TE>
<TE>   In the other men's game Monday night, Vladimir Tsyplakov
redirected a slap shot between French goalie Cristobal Huet's pads
for the decisive goal, putting Belarus into the final round of
Olympic hockey with a 3-1 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Belarus (2-0) is assured of winning its four-team preliminary
round pool even if it loses Wednesday to Switzerland (0-1-1).</TE>
<TE>   Belarus and the winner of Tuesday's Latvia-Germany game will join
Canada, the United States, the Czech Republic, Russia, Finland and
Sweden in the final round beginning Friday.</TE>
<TE>   France took a 1-0 lead in the first period on Maurice Rozenthal's
third goal in two games, but Andrei Rasolko's goal tied it later in
the period.</TE>
<TE>   Women</TE>
<TE>   Ann-Louise Edstrand scored a power play goal in the first period
on Monday as Sweden opened a three-goal lead and held on to beat
Russia 3-2 on the first day of the Olympic women's tournament at
Provo, Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden outshot Russia 44-14 to put the Russians on the verge of
elimination. With the loss, Russia needs a victory or tie over
top-seeded Canada (1-0) on Thursday to have any chance of advancing
to the medal round.</TE>
<TE>   Lotta Almblad and Kristina Bergstrand also scored for Sweden.</TE>

<LD>There are 6 billion people in the world, 131 members of the
International Olympic Committee.</LD>
<LD>   How to become one of the lucky ones?</LD>
<LD>   It's like they say about real estate and location--except that
with the IOC, the key word is connections.</LD>
<TE>   Cases in point:</TE>
<TE>   * Francois Narman, president of the national Olympic committee of
Belgium, was made a member at last week's IOC elections. The
president of the IOC is Jacques Rogge, born and raised in Ghent,
Belgium.</TE>
<TE>   * Two Arab royals, each in their early 20s, were also made
members: Sheikh Tamin Bin Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani of Qatar and
Prince Nawaf Fahd Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia. An influential
behind-the-scenes IOC figure is Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahad al-Sabah of
Kuwait, head of the Olympic Council of Asia, which represents all
that continent's national Olympic committees.</TE>
<TE>   * Last year, at an IOC session in Moscow, Juan Antonio Samaranch
Jr. of Spain was made a member.</TE>
<TE>   He is a senior official in the modern pentathlon federation, but
perhaps the other members noticed before the vote that Samaranch's
father was the outgoing IOC president.</TE>
<TE>   About 10% of the IOC membership are women--but none of the new
members.</TE>
<TE>   To the IOC's credit, Olympic athletes can now be members. Like the
athletes at the Summer Games before them, athletes at these Games
will select some members.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the reform plan enacted two years ago in the wake of
the Salt Lake bid scandal, the IOC now includes members who were
proposed because of their positions in international sports
federations or national Olympic committees.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Sandra Baldwin, the president of the U.S. Olympic
Committee, was made an IOC member last week. She is replacing Bill
Hybl in the IOC; Hybl was the former USOC president.</TE>
<TE>   Over the past couple years, the U.S. has had four IOC members.
Baldwin lives in Phoenix, the others in Southern California--Anita
DeFrantz of Los Angeles, Jim Easton of Van Nuys and Bob Ctvrtlik of
Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   There are 199 nations in the Olympic movement--more than in the
United Nations. And while many countries don't have an IOC member
(Vietnam, Ethiopia) and others have just one (North Korea), the
principality of Monaco, which isn't even really a country, has an IOC
member (Prince Albert).</TE>
<TE>   It makes abundant political sense for the U.S. to have several
members.</TE>
<TE>   Seven of the IOC's top corporate sponsors are U.S. corporations.
NBC is the IOC's chief financial underwriter, with a $3.5 billion
contract that gives it exclusive rights to televise the Games in the
U.S. from 2000 through 2008.</TE>
<TE>   For the past few years, Switzerland has had five. You think that
might have something to do with the IOC being based in Lausanne,
Switzerland?</TE>
<TE>   Connections, connections, connections.</TE>

<HD>United, They Skate</HD>
<DH>Naomi Lang and ice partner Peter Tchernyshev represent two
faces of the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP HERSH</AU>
<BD>TRIBUNE OLYMPIC BUREAU</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Naomi Lang stood on the field in Rice-Eccles Stadium, fighting tears
as members of Utah's five Native American tribes danced and sang in
front of her during the opening ceremony for the 2002 Winter
Olympics. What she saw transported her back to a childhood of eating
Indian fry bread and watching the stomp dance and the grass dance
performed by members of her tribe, the Karuk, in Northern California.</LD>
<LD>   Lang's ice-dance partner, Peter Tchernyshev, sat with members of
the U.S. Olympic team in the end zone behind her, moved by the pride
of the Native American tribal leaders as they rode horses across the
ice surface installed on the field. What he saw transported him back
to a childhood in St. Petersburg, Russia, where he had learned about
Indians by reading James Fenimore Cooper and Mayne Reid in Russian.</LD>
<LD>   Tchernyshev also found himself moved by a feeling he did not
expect would be so strong.</LD>
<TE>   "I was overwhelmed with patriotism," he said. "I never could
imagine I would have already so much pride in this country for all
the opportunities it has given me."</TE>
<TE>   Until then, Tchernyshev, 31, might not even have realized just how
much his perspective had been altered by the terrorist attacks of
Sept. 11. From his apartment in Hackensack, N.J., he can see where
the World Trade Center used to stand.</TE>
<TE>   Now he and Lang, the four-time U.S. ice-dance champions, stand
together for something, for the centuries of people who have defined
the American experience. She is a Native American, the first Indian
woman to compete for the United States in the Winter Olympics. He is
a new American, having become a citizen Jan. 29, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "It is symbolic that we have both sides, a Native American and a
new American, merging together in one peaceful mission," Tchernyshev
said.</TE>
<TE>   For Lang, that mission has taken on a much greater dimension than
simply skating in the ice-dance competition that begins Friday. She
has become a symbol to Native Americans, most of whom did not know
until recently that Lang was included among them. In mid-December, a
Native American Web site had an article headlined "Unknown Amongst
Her Own ... No Longer."</TE>
<TE>   "It's neat that she self-identifies," said Gene Keluche, chairman
of the Native American Sports Council. "So many Native Americans,
particularly those with Spanish surnames, haven't figured out their
ancestry."</TE>
<TE>   Lang, 23, never hid her heritage. Until the Olympic year, there
simply weren't many reasons to ask for biographical information about
an ice dancer who had never finished higher than eighth in the world
championships.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel great over the exposure I've been getting because it gives
Native Americans the recognition they deserve," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Suzy Chaffee, a 1968 Olympic skier who is an activist for Native
American causes, was impressed to the point of well-intentioned
overstatement.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw a stunning picture of her on the cover of [a
magazine], Indian Country Today, I thought, 'Wow, this could be
Native America's Cathy Freeman, who could do wonders to lift her
people, like Aborigines, women and blacks in past Olympics.'" Chaffee
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lang has almost no chance to win a gold medal, as Freeman, an
Aborigine, did after lighting the Olympic cauldron two years ago in
Australia. And even if Lang's role in the opening ceremony was not as
prominent as Freeman's, it was nevertheless of great significance to
Native Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "Ms. Lang has no idea as to how proud the Karuk tribe is of her
and how very much her hard work and dedication has put smiles upon
our hearts," said Gary Lake, a Karuk tribal councilman.</TE>
<TE>   Five athletes were chosen to present gifts and then receive
blessings from leaders of Utah's five Native American tribes during
the opening ceremony. Each represented a country with particular
historical meaning to the modern Olympics. Lang, representing the
2002 host country, presented a laurel wreath to Rupert Steele of the
Goshute Indian Nation.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't even describe the feeling going through me when I was
standing there," Lang said. "I have worked so hard in my life to be
where I am. I'm hoping to be a role model to give other Native
American children hope they can make something of themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Lang's recent success has brought a poignant personal reward: the
chance to reestablish a relationship with her Karuk-German father,
Jason Lang, who was divorced from Lang's mother in 1981. Two weeks
ago she received a congratulatory e-mail from him. It was their first
contact in 14 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really emotional for me," she said. "I know he still loves
me. I would like to get to know him. I don't hold any grudges or
judge people from the past. I want to look into the future."</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to imagine a future in which many Native American kids
take up figure skating, given the sport's high cost and the
relatively few rinks near Native American lands.</TE>
<TE>   "You would have said the same thing about golf until Notah Begay
came on the scene," Keluche said. "Now, with the help of the U.S.
Golf Assn., we have established 33 junior golf programs for Native
Americans across the country."</TE>
<TE>   Begay, half-Navajo, one-fourth Isleta and one-fourth San Felipe,
is the most successful Native American golfer. He has won four PGA
tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   "Naomi's achievements also can have a considerable impact on the
aspirations of our youth," Keluche said.</TE>
<TE>   Lang comes from a tribe that had settled in northwestern
California by 30 BC, according to archeological and architectural
evidence. The current Karuk population, centered in the town of Happy
Camp, Calif., is just under 4,000.</TE>
<TE>   She was born in Arcata, Calif., where her mother, Leslie Dixon,
had moved from Michigan after graduating from high school. Lang's
parents divorced when she was 3, and she moved to Michigan five years
later with her older brother, Danny, and their mother, who is of
French-English-Irish descent. Lang's Karuk name, Maheetahan, means
"Morning Star."</TE>
<TE>   "Native American culture was a big part of our life in
California," said Dixon, a psychiatric nurse in Kalamazoo. "I tried
to keep Naomi in touch with her heritage after we moved back to
Michigan. We would go back to visit our Karuk relatives once a year
until 1996, when Naomi's schedule became too busy."</TE>
<TE>   She and Tchernyshev have skated together since 1996. He had
emigrated four years earlier from Russia, hoping to find skating
opportunities after the breakup of the Soviet Union, where he had
been an undistinguished singles skater. The only English he knew at
the time was his first name.</TE>
<TE>   This has not been an easy season for them. They withdrew from fall
competitions because he had shin splints. The events of Sept. 11
haunted him as he stared across the Hudson River from his apartment.
When the tattered flag found in the World Trade Center rubble was
carried into the opening ceremony, Tchernyshev found himself "crying,
as many in the crowd were."</TE>
<TE>   The Native American part of the ceremony lifted his spirits.</TE>
<TE>   He recalled giving a skating exhibition with Lang in 1997 on a
Canadian Indian reservation just north of the New York border.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always had respect for Native Americans because of the
human qualities portrayed in the books I read," Tchernyshev said. "I
felt it at that exhibition. At the opening ceremony I got another
chance to feel their dignity and see the way they carry themselves.
When the Native Americans were dancing, I felt like Naomi and I were
taking part."</TE>
<TE>   The Russian immigrant and the Karuk, ice-dancing for Native
Americans, for all Americans, for a global TV audience.</TE>
<TE>   "It's incredible," Lang said. "Who would have thought we would
have been able to skate together in the Olympics?"</TE>

<KH>LUGE</KH>
<HD>He Let History Slide On By</HD>
<DH>Germany's Hackl fails in his bid to win four consecutive
gold medals, but he doesn't mind.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARRY TEMKIN</AU>
<BD>TRIBUNE OLYMPIC BUREAU</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Just about everyone seemed to want Georg Hackl to make history Monday
except Georg Hackl.</LD>
<LD>   The German luge superstar had a chance to win his fourth
consecutive gold medal as he began the final two runs of the men's
singles at Utah Olympic Park. No Winter Olympian has accomplished
that feat in an individual event, but Hackl barely seemed to notice,
or care.</LD>
<LD>   This is a man whose obsession with and devotion to his sport is
the stuff of legend, so for him history was just one more
distraction. Maybe that's why Hackl thrust his right fist skyward in
jubilation as he finished his final run, even though he knew that
Italy's Armin Zoeggeler--the next racer up--would almost surely end
his run of gold.</LD>
<TE>   Hackl accepted defeat graciously, pleased to have won any medal
and almost relieved for the sake of his sport that the right person
had finished No. 1, even if that person no longer was he.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm satisfied and happy with the silver medal," he said. "The
gold medal was won by the best man.</TE>
<TE>   "We are all sportsmen and accept that the best man wins."</TE>
<TE>   With a healthy 0.232-second lead through three runs, Zoeggeler
probably could have taken his fourth run on a trash can lid and still
held off Hackl. The 28-year-old Italian policeman was consistently
fast beginning with his first run Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   He posted at least the second-fastest time on each of his four
runs while compiling a total time of 2:57.941, a healthy 0.329 of a
second ahead of Hackl. Austria's Markus Prock finished third in
2:58.283; Adam Heidt of the U.S. was fourth in 2:58.606.</TE>
<TE>   With his victory, Zoeggeler finally laid claim to the title of
world's top luger, a status he seemed primed to attain after winning
two world championships and two World Cup titles since he won the
silver medal in the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a long wait and a long way to this gold medal," said
Zoeggeler, who won a bronze medal in 1994 in Lillehammer, Norway. "It
took a lot of power and energy, but now I'm really happy."</TE>
<TE>   Hackl, 35, said a shot at a fourth gold medal did not motivate him
to compete in his fifth Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "My motivation to come here was first and foremost my sport," he
said. "Maybe we can talk about history later, but not right now."</TE>
<TE>   The silver medal, which matched the one Hackl won in 1988 in
Calgary, did make him the first Olympian to win a medal in five
consecutive Winter Games. Through all those Games, he finished ahead
of Prock, who won two silvers plus Monday's bronze.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed Zoeggeler too, might wind up forever in Hackl's
rear-view mirror. But Hackl, hampered by an old back injury, had four
mediocre starts and couldn't make up enough ground.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, the 37-year-old Prock said he was 99% sure he was
retiring, even though he set a track record of 44.271 on his third
run. Hackl said he will compete for another year, then assess his
future.</TE>
<TE>   He provided the day's most poignant moment when he dedicated his
latest medal to his father Georg, who died last month. The son then
broke into tears and covered his face with his hands.</TE>
<TE>   Though only 24, Heidt said he will evaluate whether to continue
making the sacrifices in time and money that a luge career demands.
Monday, he was content to savor achieving the best Olympic finish
ever for a U.S. singles luger. Wendel Suckow placed fifth in the '94
Games, and Cammy Myler matched that in 1992 in France.</TE>
<TE>   Heidt was fourth after Sunday's two runs. "I felt right up until
the end I had a shot at a medal," he said. "I never sell myself
short.</TE>
<TE>   "This may not be a medal, but it's the highest ever for an
American, and I'm pretty happy with that."</TE>

<LD>The NBC announcers working Monday night's pairs competition were as
incensed as everyone else about the judges' decision that deprived
Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier of a gold medal and gave it
to Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze.</LD>
<LD>   "My heart breaks for both pairs, and I'm embarrassed for our sport
right now," NBC commentator Sandra Bezic, a former Canadian pairs
champion, said before the medals ceremony.</LD>
<LD>   Partner Scott Hamilton said, "How did that happen? They won that
program. There's not a doubt of anyone in the place, except for maybe
a few judges. That will be debated forever.</LD>
<TE>   "How do you win the performance, win the crowd, win the night and
lose the medal? One point. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union,
except for Kristi Yamaguchi and Tara Lipinski, every single gold
medal in those Olympics has gone to Russian republics. Every single
one."</TE>
<TE>   Play-by-play announcer Tom Hammond said, "They'll talk about this
one for a long time. So the Russian domination of Olympic pairs
skating continues here in Salt Lake City. The first figure skating
event of these Winter Games features beautiful skating in the pairs
free skate. With a controversial finish as the Russians win again,
and there's yet another judging controversy in the figure skating
world."</TE>
<TE>   The announcers were almost totally silent while Sale and Pelletier
were skating. Finally, Hamilton said, "Throw a triple loop, and the
gold is theirs!"</TE>
<TE>   After Sale landed cleanly to complete the triple loop, Bezic said,
"Simply perfect.... They did it!"</TE>
<TE>   Apparently they weren't perfect enough to satisfy the judges.</TE>

<TE>   Elvis is back in the building. And in figure skating, that can
mean a spectacular display of jumping and artistry.</TE>
<TE>   The building in this case is the Salt Lake Ice Center, where the
men's figure skating competition will begin tonight with the short
program. And Elvis is Elvis Stojko of Canada, the two-time Olympic
silver medalist whose brilliance has been dimmed in recent years by a
series of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   This time, though, he said he's fit and eager to skate. That would
add another element of intrigue to a competition that promises to
deliver fireworks from Russian rivals Evgeny Plushenko and Alexei
Yagudin, as well as quadruple-jump masters Timothy Goebel of the U.S.
and Alexander Abt of Russia.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody can be beaten," said Stojko, who fought a groin injury to
finish second to Ilia Kulik of Russia at the 1998 Nagano Games.
"There's nobody invincible."</TE>
<TE>   Stojko, 29, is a four-time Olympian and three-time world champion.
He finished fifth at the season-opening Goodwill Games in September,
second to Yagudin at Skate Canada and sixth at the Nations Cup behind
Plushenko, Goebel, Chengjiang Li of China, Abt and Takeshi Honda of
Japan. He didn't qualify for the Grand Prix Final.</TE>
<TE>   However, he is optimistic he can keep his mind and body together
to grab the gold in his fourth and final Olympic appearance.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel very light here," said Stojko, who will perform his
2-minute, 40-second program last of the 29 men today. "Just ready to
skate and not worried about anything.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any injuries. I don't have any problems. I've waited
four years to come back and skate."</TE>
<TE>   Six-time U.S. champion Todd Eldredge, a three-time Olympian who
was 10th at Albertville in 1992 and fourth at Nagano in 1998, is also
hoping his final appearance will be his most enjoyable on many
levels.</TE>
<TE>   "In my first one, I had a back injury, but it was still kind of a
great experience being at the Olympics because it was my lifelong
goal to be there," he said. "At Nagano, I was thinking it would be my
last time competing at the Games, and I put a lot of pressure on
myself.... I don't look at a medal anymore. I just look at having a
great experience. I haven't had that, outside of the opening
ceremonies."</TE>
<TE>   Eldredge, who was among the eight athletes chosen to carry the
World Trade Center flag into the opening ceremony, was third at Skate
Canada, second at the Trophee Lalique and fourth at the Grand Prix
Final this season. But after finishing behind bronze medalist Goebel
at the Grand Prix Final, Eldredge defeated Goebel at the U.S.
championships last month at Staples Center.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The head of the U.S. Olympic Committee when the Salt Lake City
scandal broke is about to become vice president of an international
sports group led by a powerful South Korean implicated in the case.</LD>
<LD>   Former USOC president Bill Hybl has been offered the vice
presidency of the International Taekwondo Federation, a source with
knowledge of the offer said Monday, speaking on condition of
anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, Hybl was instrumental in helping his hometown of
Colorado Springs, Colo., become host of this year's meeting of the
General Assn. of International Sports Federations, the umbrella
organization of Olympic sports. Both the federation and GAISF are run
by Kim Un Yong, an International Olympic Committee member who was
censured in the million-dollar scam involving Salt Lake City's
winning bid for the Winter Olympics.</LD>
<TE>   An IOC ethics panel handed Kim a "most severe" warning three years
ago after it concluded he had used his position in international
sports to further the careers of his son and daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Hybl, whose term on the IOC expired last week, declined to discuss
a position with the taekwondo federation. Kim was unavailable for
comment. Last summer, Kim finished second in voting for the IOC
presidency, defeating--among others--Dick Pound, the Canadian member
who led the ethics investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Hybl was USOC president from late 1996 until December 2000, and
was in office when the scandal broke in November 1998. He
commissioned an independent ethics investigation, headed that found
"an improper culture of gift-giving" in the Olympic bid system.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   David Wallechinsky, Los Angeles freelance writer and
internationally known Olympic historian, got twin surprises in Salt
Lake City the last few days, when he was added to the prestigious
list of those being awarded the Olympic Order.</TE>
<TE>   Wallechinsky, of Santa Monica, who has written 20 books and
perhaps received the most acclaim for his eight on the Olympics,
arrived in Salt Lake City last week and soon was told that he would
be accorded the Olympic Order. That was the first surprise.</TE>
<TE>   The second was in the ceremony Sunday, in which the silver Laurel
Wreaths signifying the honor were handed out by President Jacques
Rogge of the International Olympic Committee. Besides Wallechinsky,
the honor went to Irwin Belk, longtime USOC member; Eduardo Henrique
de Rose of Brazil, longtime member of the IOC medical commission; and
Peter Montgomery, vice president of the Australian Olympic Committee.</TE>
<TE>   But after Rogge presented the awards, he said that, by protocol,
only one person would be asked to speak for the group, and added,
"Because David is a radio broadcaster, we invite him to say a few
words." Wallechinsky, who is working here for MSNBC and Westwood One,
said he was both flattered and unprepared. "I did my best,"
Wallechinsky said. "I just said that one would hope that receiving
this award would not be the end of what all four of us did and will
do for the Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   Wallechinsky, 54, was nominated by IOC member Pound. He said that,
upon returning to the Westwood One broadcast facilities, his fellow
workers referred to him as "Your Eminence."</TE>
<TE>   "I assume that will end soon," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Aerial skier Jacqui Cooper, Australia's best hope for a medal at
the Salt Lake Winter Olympics, ruptured a knee ligament in a nasty
fall while training and will not be able to compete at the Games,
Australian officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper, 29, a three-time World Cup champion, tore her anterior
cruciate ligament when she landed awkwardly after a jump in Deer
Valley, Utah, site of the freestyle aerial event.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NBC continues to get solid ratings with its Winter Olympics
coverage and easily beat the competition. NBC got a 17.6 rating with
a 27 share for its third night of coverage Sunday, while ABC averaged
a 6.4/10 for the same time period, Fox a 6.3/9 and CBS a 6.1/9.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles rating for Sunday night's coverage was a 18.5/28,
again beating the national average. And Salt Lake City again had the
top local-market rating with a 37.0/57, followed by Portland with a
27.5/41 and Denver with a 24.3/36. San Francisco drew a 19.6/32.</TE>
<TE>   The 17.6 national rating was NBC's highest for a Sunday night
since Game 6 of the NBA finals in 1998, when Michael Jordan's
last-second shot against Utah gave the Chicago Bulls their sixth NBA
title. That game got a 22.3.</TE>
<TE>   The 17.6, however, was lower than the 20.2 CBS got for its third
night of Winter Olympics coverage in 1998. CBS' first Sunday in
Nagano, Japan, was highlighted by women's figure skating and the 20.2
was the network's third highest of the 17 days of the Games.</TE>
<TE>   NBC also reported that Sunday's NBA All-Star game delivered an
8.2/15 nationally, a 61% increase over last year's 5.1/8. NBC
credited the Olympic lead-in for the increase. In L.A., the All-Star
game drew a 10.7/23.</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The Russian dynasty in Olympic pairs figure skating lives on, albeit
with a little help from training facilities in New Jersey and a
controversial decision by the judges.</LD>
<LD>   Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, who train in Hackensack,
edged world champions Jamie Sale and David Pelletier of Canada by a
5-4 margin in the long program Monday to win the 11th consecutive
Olympic gold medal for Soviet or Russian pair skaters. Although the
crowd at the Salt Lake Ice Center favored Sale and Pelletier's
romantic "Love Story" routine, judges from Russia, China, France,
Poland and Ukraine preferred Berezhnaya and Skiharulidze's classical
rendition of "Meditation from Thais," ignoring a stumble by
Sikharulidze on the landing of a double axel jump.</LD>
<LD>   Xue Shen and Hongbo Zhao of China were third, narrowly missing a
historic moment when Shen fell on the landing of a throw quadruple
salchow. U.S. champions Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman were fifth,
unable to move up after the short program despite an impressive
performance to Rachmaninov.</LD>
<TE>   The subjectivity of figure skating, always a source of debate,
drove Sale and Pelletier to tears. Having overcome a collision in the
warmup between Sale and Sikharulidze that left Sale with bruised
knees and a sore stomach, they gave a poignant performance that
brought the crowd of 16,458 to its feet and inspired Pelletier to
kiss the ice in gratitude.</TE>
<TE>   To learn it wasn't enough to win was almost more than they could
bear, but Pelletier acknowledged disappointment is part of any sport
with elements that can't be quantified.</TE>
<TE>   "Your Olympic dreams can sometimes turn into Olympic nightmares.
I'm just happy my Olympic dream stayed an Olympic dream," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to rain on anybody's parade. If I didn't want this
to happen, I would have gone down the hill on skis. I can't believe
we did it like this. This was the toughest day of my life....</TE>
<TE>   "I was shaking in my pants before I got on the ice. This is such a
relief. For six months, you go to the grocery store and you bring
back gold. You go to the hardware store and bring back gold, and I
just was going to buy a hammer. It's six months of people's
expectations coming out of me.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a human being and obviously sad to come second, but nobody
can ever take this performance away from me."</TE>
<TE>   Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze received four 5.7s and five 5.8s (out
of 6.0) for their technical marks and seven 5.9s and two 5.8s for
presentation. Sale and Pelletier got six 5.8s and three 5.9s for
technical merit and five 5.8s and four 5.9s for presentation. They
were ranked first by the judges from the U.S., Canada, Germany and
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   NBC commentator Scott Hamilton, the 1984 men's gold medalist,
called the result heartbreaking as his voice cracked with emotion.
Fellow commentator Sandra Bezic, a Canadian who has choreographed
gold medal-winning programs for Tara Lipinski, Brian Boitano and
Kristi Yamaguchi, seconded that sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm embarrassed for our sport right now," Bezic said.</TE>
<TE>   But the Russians' coach, Tamara Moskvina--a legend in the
sport--saw no reason for a fuss. And Sikharulidze said the pair's
performance merited gold, extending a Russian stranglehold that began
in 1964 with Lyudmila Belousova and Oleg Protopopov at the Innsbruck
Games.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to skate with emotion, with our feelings, with everything.
I try hard and I try my best," he said. "I don't put the marks and we
don't make a big mistake. That's important, too. There were no falls.
There was something with my jump but not a big thing. It's a detail.
We tried to do something special and open from inside."</TE>
<TE>   Berezhnaya, who survived a 1996 practice accident in which the
blade of her then-partner Oleg Shliakov penetrated her skull and
temporarily inflicted brain and motor-skill damage, was overcome
after learning she and Sikharulidze had won.</TE>
<TE>   "There's something different in the air," she said of the
Olympics. "Just like one moment, and that's it, and everything
happens. It's just unforgettable feelings."</TE>
<TE>   Sale won't forget her feelings, either, saying she still loves
figure skating despite its inherent flaws.</TE>
<TE>   "What's happened has made me love the sport even more," she said.
"Flying through the air, the chemistry I have with Dave--nothing will
ever take that away.... Our silver medal is worth a gold to us."</TE>
<TE>   Ina and Zimmerman, skating to Rachmaninov, skated as smoothly as
much in unision as they have in their 3 1/2 years together, a
performance marred only when she touched her hand to the ice in
landing a double axel. They were ecstatic with their performance,
hugging at center ice while an appreciative crowd gave them a
standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the best thing I ever felt in my life," Zimmerman said.
"To be in the Olympics, being in the U.S, the crowd was boisterous
and supportive. Kyoko and I both fed off it. When we did the second
lift, it was like a big hand was helping us and pushed us along."</TE>
<TE>   Said Ina, who finished out of the medals at two previous Olympics
with a different partner: "If I walked away tonight, I could say I
walked away at the top of my career. Both John and I can say we leave
on a good note."</TE>
<TE>   The second-ranked U.S. pair, Tiffany Scott and Philip Dulebohn,
finished 13th after a rocky performance. Scott fell on both throws
and stepped out of a jump, and they collided as he let her down after
a triple twist. The couple had missed most of this season because he
had a hip fracture.</TE>

<KH>Mike Penner THE DAY IN SALT LAKE</KH>
<HD>It's a New Definition for Success in U.S.</HD>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Snowboarding? We rock! Curling? We roll!</LD>
<LD>   We also shred, sweep, fakie, freeze, bonk, cab, clean and tail
slide with the best of them. But you already knew that.</LD>
<LD>   Monday at the Olympics, the United States unleashed its
snowboarders and curlers on the world. Results? Pretty rad. The U.S.
snowboarders swept the men's halfpipe medals--gold to Ross Powers,
silver to Danny Kass, bronze to J.J. Thomas. At the same time, on an
ice sheet in Ogden, the U.S. men's curling team swept, and swept some
more, until it had defeated reigning world champion Sweden, 10-5--a
result that stunned the curling world and had halfpipers in Park City
saying, "Huh?"</LD>
<TE>   Snowboarding and curling. The so-called pastimes of Generation X
and Generation Zzzzzz, as different in style and intensity as skate
punk and polka, McTwists and McMuffins, beer keggers and ... well,
beer keggers.</TE>
<TE>   The events entered the Olympic arena side by side in 1998, much to
the bewilderment of either sport.</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarders wondered what they were doing in the same Games with
a bunch of old people with odd accents armed with strange brooms.
Curlers wondered what they were doing sharing the same Olympic
village with a bunch of young hellions with odd accents armed with
strange tunes. First time out in Nagano, both sports experienced
growing pains. The '98 snowboarding competition went up in a cloud of
smoke, all the giant slalom and halfpipe results overshadowed by what
Canadian gold medalist Ross Rebagliati did or didn't have in his
halfpipe. (A drug test said it was marijuana.) Canada also incurred a
curling disaster when its favored men's team, unsettled in a faraway
land where fish is eaten raw instead of pickled or smoked, fell apart
in the final and was routed by Switzerland, 9-3.</TE>
<TE>   Great curling squads, like great armies, travel on their stomachs.</TE>
<TE>   Second time around, the Americans, as is their tendency, have
elbowed their way to the front of the pack, showing everyone else how
it's supposed to be done. After Kelly Clark's victory in the women's
halfpipe Sunday, the U.S. men's sweep gave the United States four of
the six 2002 halfpipe medals.</TE>
<TE>   And the U.S. men's curling team, according to a U.S. men's curling
press release, "stole a single in the second when Sweden's last-rock
draw for one was just slightly heavy.... The dramatic seventh was set
up by vice skip Mike Schneeberger, who made a raise takeout and
rolled the shooter over to guard another U.S. rock. Then came
[Sweden's Peja] Lindholm's draw, and eventually the counterpunch."</TE>
<TE>   We're talking two sports and two different languages here.</TE>
<TE>   But, since we rule the world in both, the least we can do as new
diehard snowboarding and curling fans is learn the subtle variances
between the two.</TE>
<TE>   STONE</TE>
<TE>   Curling: The round, handled granite playing piece. The focus of
everyone's intense attention.</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding: What friends allegedly tried to do to Canada's
Rebagliati during a pre-Olympic party in 1998. Rebagliati went on to
win the gold medal in men's parallel giant slalom, then had his medal
stripped after testing positive for marijuana, then had his medal
returned after successfully appealing on the grounds that marijuana
is not a "performance-enhancing" drug. Unless, of course, the event
is parallel giant pizza consumption.</TE>
<TE>   ROCK</TE>
<TE>   Curling: Another name for the stone.</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding: To snowboard successfully. As in, "Dude, you
rocked!" Also: The form of music preferred by snowboarders--although
(very important here) absolutely none of that stuff preferred by
snowboarders' older brothers and sisters. Birth of the genre: Circa
1999. Old-school practitioners: Green Day, Blink 182, Jimmy Eat
World. Rolling Stones? Huh? That's a curling thing, right?</TE>
<TE>   BONK</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding: The act of hitting an object with the snowboard.</TE>
<TE>   Curling: The act of hitting a spectator with the stone.</TE>
<TE>   AIR</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding: Leaving the ground by jumping or leaping.</TE>
<TE>   Curling: That stuff on the top of a Canadian curler's 'ead.</TE>
<TE>   FREEZE</TE>
<TE>   Curling: A stone thrown and played to come out to rest against
another rock.</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding: What 30,000 spectators did when they came out to
Park City Monday to root for the Americans against the world.</TE>
<TE>   SKIP</TE>
<TE>   Curling: The player who usually throws stones last, directs the
game and determines the team's strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding: What Norwegian snowboarder Terje Hakonsen, the
Michael Jordan of the halfpipe, did to the 1998 and 2002 Winter
Olympics. Snowboarding, says Terje, is "about fresh tracks and
carving powder and being yourself and not being judged by others."</TE>
<TE>   OLLIE</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding: Method to obtain air without a jump by first lifting
the front foot, then lifting the rear foot as you spring off the tail
of the board.</TE>
<TE>   Curling: Curler from Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   EAT</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding: To wipe out.</TE>
<TE>   Curling: To pass the time before, after and during a curling
competition.</TE>
<TE>   POP TART</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding: Airing backward to forward without rotation.</TE>
<TE>   Curling: Judging by appearances, a popular training-table food.</TE>
<TE>   STALEFISH</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding: Type of air achieved when the rear hand grabs the
heel edge of the board behind the rear leg and between the bindings
while the rear leg is straightened.</TE>
<TE>   Curling: Bad pregame meal.</TE>
<TE>   CANADIAN BACON</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding: Type of air achieved when the rear hand reaches
behind the rear leg to grab the toe edge of the board between the
bindings while the rear leg is straightened.</TE>
<TE>   Curling: Good pregame meal.</TE>

<HD>A New Marquee Event That Is Worlds Apart</HD>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The future of Olympic sports McTwisted and Stalefished across
America's front porch Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Its jeans hanging halfway off its rear end.</LD>
<LD>   Its hair hanging tangled off its head.</LD>
<TE>   Its dreams not exactly the dreams of heroes past.</TE>
<TE>   "I would never want to be on a Wheaties box, I never eat the
stuff," said Danny Kass, smiling. "Put me on Count Chocula."</TE>
<TE>   Draped in heavy metal and big air, the future of Olympic sports
landed square in the middle of America's fears that its children will
go too fast, risk too much, hang too loose ... and get away with it.</TE>
<TE>   Does a medal sweep by three of our kids in something called
halfpipe snowboarding qualify as getting away with it?</TE>
<TE>   It sure sounded as if it did at raucous Park City, where Ross
Powers, Kass and J.J. Thomas won the gold, silver and bronze medals,
respectively, in only the second U.S. winter sweep ever.</TE>
<TE>   After which, Powers and Thomas autographed the bare breasts of an
excited female fan.</TE>
<TE>   While Kass acknowledged a male blowup doll he jokingly called his
team manager.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, this is not going to be easy.</TE>
<TE>   That's four U.S. snowboarding medals in two events that, despite
their lofty status as Olympic sports, still appear to some as
skateboarders doing tricks in overcoats.</TE>
<TE>   The question is not whether America is the new dominant power in
what could be the Winter Olympics' new dominant game.</TE>
<TE>   The question is, does it want to be?</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding, after all, is not simply two skis tied together.</TE>
<TE>   It is a culture apart.</TE>
<TE>   It is more than the traversing of a hill, it is the empowering of
a generation, with a sometimes reckless, sometimes rebellious
attitude that sometimes irritates instead of inspires.</TE>
<TE>   What adult skier has not looked either angrily or jealously at the
young tattooed soul flying past him on a snowboard?</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarders are often viewed not as young people lawfully flexing
their voice, but as transplanted bums from the mini-mart parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   Loiterers, only faster.</TE>
<TE>   The average American sports fan understands the athlete who
listens to music on headphones before the competition. But during the
competition?</TE>
<TE>   "Why not? It's cool," Kass said.</TE>
<TE>   And doesn't the average American sports fan want its athletes to,
like, lift weights?</TE>
<TE>   "It haven't been to a gym in, I don't know, two years," Kass said.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, America wants its athletes to at least act like
athletes.</TE>
<TE>   "I try not to think of myself as a jock," Kass said.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, snowboarders were shoved into the Olympics four years
ago by officials who viewed them not necessarily as studs, but
marketers.</TE>
<TE>   As figure skating attracts women, and downhill skiing attracts
men, snowboarding could speak--and sell--to young adults.</TE>
<TE>   "If you understand kids," said Kass, 19, "then you understand us."</TE>
<TE>   But many still didn't understand.</TE>
<TE>   And when that 1998 winner of the first Olympic snowboarding event,
Canada's Ross Rebagliati, tested positive for marijuana and
temporarily lost his medal, the news was greeted with rolled eyes and
tongue-clucking.</TE>
<TE>   You see? Thought so.</TE>
<TE>   Many figured that snowboarders would finally just go away, much
like skateboarders are eventually kicked out of grocery-store parking
lots.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I've been kicked out of a few parking lots," Kass said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet suddenly, in the middle of last week, they showed up again.</TE>
<TE>   I know because I was there, at the news conference for the
halfpipe folks, the longest hour in the history of the hired
interpreters.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of those words they used, there's no translation for them,"
said frustrated Renate Dallmann, a German expert. "I had to reach way
back to high school for some of the other words."</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the meeting, everyone was staring at Kass because,
with shaggy hair and distant eyes, he looked just like the infamous
"Fast Times at Ridgemont High" burnout named Jeff Spicoli.</TE>
<TE>   Sounded like him too.</TE>
<TE>   When asked how he liked being a first-time Olympian, he squinted.</TE>
<TE>   "The uniforms are pretty mommy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When asked how he deals with the pressure of being a first-time
Olympian, he squinted.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe lots of video games?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about his sport's reputation, though, he frowned.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't do this sport if you're high, you can't do it if you're
drunk," he said. "That's just crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Crazy, perhaps, but Monday morning, the Salt Lake Tribune carried
a story written by Kirsten Stewart with this first paragraph:</TE>
<TE>   "University of Utah fraternity bashes are like Tupperware parties
compared with the drunken, late night revelry of snowboarders renting
the Beta Theta Pi house during the Olympics, says an angry Greek Row
neighbor."</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, those snowboarders aren't Olympians, but workers at a
nearby extreme-sports expo. But still ...</TE>
<TE>   Then later Monday, America's Olympic snowboarders brought the
party where it belonged, to the snow, and above the snow, with
acrobatic moves and tricks that would have won a gold medal for any
gymnast or diver.</TE>
<TE>   They are different. But they are athletes. And they aren't going
to leave the room while you wait for them to grow up.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like in high school, the cool kids were on the football team
... but the skateboarders were stealing all their cheerleaders," Kass
said, grinning. "I know some kids from my high school are really
surprised when they see me on TV. They're probably like, uh-oh ... "</TE>
<TE>   Probably. Right up until they see the silver medal draped around
his neck, and hear our national anthem played for another dude just
like him.</TE>

<DL>KEARNS, Utah</DL>
<LD>His major competitor slipped and fell in the first half of the men's
500-meter race Monday at the Utah Olympic Oval, so in today's second
half, American speedskater Casey FitzRandolph has to be concerned
pretty much with only one man.</LD>
<LD>   Casey FitzRandolph.</LD>
<LD>   If he can skate as fast and as well today as he did Monday, he
will win a medal. If he can skate a little faster, a little better,
he can assure that its color will be gold. If he falls, as did his
good friend and chief rival, Canadian Jeremy Wotherspoon, all will be
lost.</LD>
<TE>   So FitzRandolph's task today, in speedskating's only two-day race,
will be to skate as fast as he can, but not so fast that he's out of
control, while being as careful as is prudent, but not so careful as
to slow himself down.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, he has to skate a fine line.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little bit afraid in my turns [Monday], and that's not
good," he said after putting himself in the lead with an
Olympic-record time of 34.42 seconds. "It slowed me down. I have to
be more aggressive and trust the ice more."</TE>
<TE>   And there's the rub. Wotherspoon, the World Cup leader skating in
the last pair of the day and eager to beat the time FitzRandolph had
posted three pairs earlier, trusted the ice and never made it to a
turn. In fact, he never made it through the first 50 meters, falling
before getting a chance to stretch his legs after his start.</TE>
<TE>   "He did a couple of steps in the beginning, and then his skates
got stuck," Canadian Coach Shawn Ireland said. "It appeared to be a
technical error."</TE>
<TE>   That error not only left FitzRandolph in the driver's seat, but
also boosted the medal chances of teammate Kip Carpenter, who,
surprisingly, finished the day in third place, sandwiched between
FitzRandolph and their now-most-dangerous opponent, world record
holder Hiroyasu Shimuzu of Japan, the defending Olympic champion.</TE>
<TE>   Shimuzu, paired with American Joey Cheek, skated a
then-Olympic-record 34.61, knocking Carpenter out of the lead he had
taken with a run of 34.68. Cheek skated 34.78 and starts today's race
in seventh place.</TE>
<TE>   Marc Pelchat, the fourth American, is 34th after demonstrating
what grace under pressure is all about. Noted for his explosive
start, Pelchat, like Wotherspoon, had hardly begun his race when he
went pitching to the ice. The former hockey player slid, spun around
on his bottom, then scrambled to his skates and resumed racing.
Veteran speedskating observers agreed there had never been a more
graceful recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Although he was the unwitting beneficiary of Wotherspoon's fall,
FitzRandolph viewed it with sadness. Since the Nagano Games four
years ago, the veteran skater from Verona, Wis., has been training
with the Canadian team at the Calgary Olympic rink. So he and
Wotherspoon are more than rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Shimuzu, only .19 of a second behind, still looms as a formidable
rival. And FitzRandolph, even with his fast time, had to steady
himself with a hand on the ice through the last turn. One bobble and
...</TE>
<TE>   "I am not too happy," Shimuzu said. "I came here to win the gold
medal. That's what I am going for."</TE>

<LD>Max Fillmore is opening his home in Bountiful, a suburb of Salt Lake
City, for 10 days to a couple he has never met, knowing only they
need a place to stay and he needs to contribute something toward
making Olympic visitors feel welcome.</LD>
<LD>   Starting Wednesday, Fillmore and his wife, Sharla, will host Gail
and Joanne Smith, the father and stepmother of Sunset Beach
short-track speedskater Rusty Smith. The arrangement was made through
the Athlete Family Host program, which is sponsored by Samsung. The
program places more than 1,000 relatives of Olympians from around the
world with 600 families in the Salt Lake City area. In addition to
the families of U.S. athletes, families of athletes from Japan,
Russia, Lithuania and Australia have been matched with local host
families.</LD>
<LD>   Fillmore, a food services broker, and his wife, an elementary
school principal, know the Smiths only through e-mail. Yet Fillmore
said he had no hesitation about offering them accommodations and as
much tour-guide advice as they want.</LD>
<TE>   "We're very excited," he said. "My wife is volunteering, driving
for the Olympic family, and my son is driving athletes. I was
thinking this is an opportunity I could meet some people and have a
good time and not make such a commitment to [volunteer] training,
which required a tremendous amount of commitment.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard about the program on the radio and we were lucky enough
to be picked. The program is designed for a maximum of eight days,
but they said they were going to stay in a hotel 90 miles away, and
we said we couldn't let them do that."</TE>
<TE>   Smith, whose mother, stepfather and girlfriend will stay with
other host families, is delighted with the generosity. "My parents
don't have a lot of money so they wouldn't have been able to come
otherwise," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fillmore said he hadn't heard of Smith, but has done some research
since discovering he would be host of Smith's family.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm eager to meet them and learn a little bit more about what his
chances are to bring home the gold," Fillmore said.</TE>
<TE>   Condo Mania</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that some residents of a Salt Lake City condo are
hanging international flags from their balconies.</TE>
<TE>   The bad news is, some passers-by claiming to be from the People's
Republic of China demanded that Taiwanese flags hanging from the
balcony of two condos be removed.</TE>
<TE>   The condo representatives rebuffed the two men, claimed that they
weren't going to be bullied or back down from their mission of
spreading international good will.</TE>
<TE>   Then they admitted that the owners of those two condos left town
before the Games, so nothing could be done anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Gracious or Cautious?</TE>
<TE>   Herb Brooks, coaching the U.S. men's hockey team for the first
time since he guided the 1980 team to a stunning gold medal at Lake
Placid, said he declined an invitation to join the 1980 Olympians in
lighting the caldron high above Rice-Eccles Stadium during last
Friday's opening ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "It was nice to see. I watched it on television," he said. "I had
a chance to maybe go, but it belongs to the players.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't going to get up that high with the players because maybe
they'd push me off."</TE>
<TE>   Player Prerogative</TE>
<TE>   Brooks also said team captain Mike Eruzione has, over the years,
exaggerated some aspects of the 1980 team's odyssey.</TE>
<TE>   "I listen to the gospel according to Mike," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike believes in free speech. He just doesn't give 'em anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Skater With Voltage</TE>
<TE>   Never underestimate the inspirational power of the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   In his Olympic debut, speedskater Kip Carpenter, 22, of
Brookfield, Wis., skated the men's 500 meters in Olympic-record time,
34.68 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't hold up, but it was good enough for third place, going
into today's second half.</TE>
<TE>   Said Carpenter:</TE>
<TE>   "This was my first Olympic race and I was super amped. I was more
nervous for the Olympic trials. So many times this morning, I just
couldn't wait. I wanted to go out there and rip it up.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to have the best
performance of my life."</TE>
<TE>   Rinky-Dink</TE>
<TE>   So you want to see one of the Olympics' most popular events? Be
prepared to see only three-fourths of it.</TE>
<TE>   Amazingly, the Delta Center has seats--including some of the most
expensive ones--from which one cannot see the entire ice during
figure skating events.</TE>
<TE>   Even more amazingly, organizers have acknowledged this blunder and
are selling discount, obstructed view tickets.</TE>
<TE>   The problem? What else? Greed.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Olympics, organizers had a choice of holding the figure
skating events in the larger E Center rink on the outskirts of town,
or in downtown Salt Lake City on the smaller surface of the Delta
Center (renamed the Salt Lake Ice Center during the Olympics).</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to generate more bucks because the Delta Center has more
seats, they decided to hold it there.</TE>

<HD>After Stumbles, Jansen Finished Strong</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The baby Dan Jansen waltzed with across the ice in Lillehammer, the
9-month-old named after his beloved sister? Little Jane is 8 now, and
Jansen no longer can hold her over his head. And Jane has a sister,
Olivia, who is 6.</LD>
<LD>   But Jansen is divorced from Robin. It was Robin who wept in the
stands and passed baby Jane through the crowd so that Dan could carry
Jane. Dan is remarried and living in North Carolina so he can be
close to his daughters.</LD>
<LD>   So the fairy tale does have a messier, real-life ending.</LD>
<TE>   But Olympic fans will forever get chills watching the replay of
one speedskating race.</TE>
<TE>   Because of one race, Jansen had his future set. He can earn
$15,000 for one speaking engagement. And he can endorse products, be
a TV commentator, as he is for NBC. Setting seven world speedskating
records, winning seven speedskating World Cup championships would
have set him up for nothing but the need to find a regular job.</TE>
<TE>   But because, on Feb. 18, 1994, Jansen won a gold medal in his
eighth, and final, Olympic race, he became a beloved Olympic
champion--by his countrymen and speedskating fans around the world.</TE>
<TE>   We knew Jansen's story on that February day at the raucous
speedskating oval in Hamar, Norway. We knew how Jansen, youngest of
nine children, had been fourth as an unknown 18-year-old in the 500
meters at the 1984 Olympics; how his sister, Jane, his inspiration
and mentor, had died of leukemia on the day of his 500-meter race at
the 1988 Calgary Games and how Jansen raced anyway, then slipped and
fell and how he fell again, four days later, in the 1,000-meter
event.</TE>
<TE>   We knew Jansen came to the 1992 Albertville Games as a favorite in
the 500 but skated heavily in slushy ice and finished fourth. He
tried so hard in the 1,000 that he pushed himself too hard early and
faded to 26th at the finish.</TE>
<TE>   In all the other big races, the non-Olympic ones, Jansen won. He
came to Lillehammer at his peak, a 28-year-old who had won the most
important 500-meter races of the year. But in the Olympic race,
Jansen slipped again. He finished, but was eighth. For a couple of
days, Jansen was so discouraged he said he wouldn't skate the 1,000.</TE>
<TE>   When he got to the starting line, Jansen said later, he was
without much hope. But as the starting gun fired, he felt a jolt of
electricity. With the Norwegian crowd loudly in his corner, Jansen
was on a world-record pace at 600 meters. Even when he slipped in the
second-to-last turn, the feeling was different. Jansen kept going. As
he crossed the finish line, he tried to find the clock.</TE>
<TE>   But Jansen didn't really need the clock. The crowd told him the
result--a world record. Jansen watched for nearly 40 minutes as the
rest of the field continued, but no one threatened his time.</TE>
<TE>   It was then that Robin passed little Jane down through the crowd.
As the national anthem played, Jansen pointed to the sky,
acknowledging his sister, Jane.</TE>
<TE>   Jansen didn't return calls for this story, but in other reports he
has said his life is good. The divorce was painful, but he recovered.
He's near his girls, and his parents live in North Carolina too.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Strange as it might sound, the most impressive performance in
Canada's 7-0 victory over Kazakhstan in the women's hockey
preliminary round came from the losing goaltender.</LD>
<LD>   At times, Kazakhstan's Natalya Trunova looked like a cartoon
character scrambling to catch every plate from a falling stack of
dishes. She faced a staggering 66 shots and managed to turn away 59.</LD>
<LD>   Five of Canada's goals came on power plays. And five of them came
off rebounds, as Kazakhstan's defenders repeatedly failed to clear
the hard-charging Canadians from the crease.</LD>
<TE>   "She played a great game," said Canadian forward Cherie Piper, who
had a goal and an assist. "Our hats are off to her."</TE>
<TE>   Trunova used every covered inch of her 5-foot-5 body--and more--to
stop shots, from her skates to her helmet. She even came 15 feet in
front of the net to snatch an airborne puck. And when Canada's
Isabelle Chartrand casually slid the puck toward the net after an
offside call, Trunova kicked that away too.</TE>
<TE>   One play typified how her day went. She reached to her left to
make a great glove save against Vicky Sunohara, but she couldn't hold
the puck and Sunohara scored on the rebound.</TE>
<TE>   By the third period, Trunova looked spent. She dropped to one knee
in rare moments when the puck was at the other end of the ice. (Her
counterpart, Kim St.-Pierre, faced only 11 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the crowd cheered louder with every save Trunova
made in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   "I could feel the support in the third period from the people
around here," Trunova said. "But I definitely could feel the support
of all the people in Kazakhstan as well."</TE>
<TE>   The game represented progress for Kazakhstan, which doesn't have
any women's hockey leagues. It lost its last game to Canada, 11-0.</TE>
<TE>   For Canada, these Games represent glorified practice laps around
the rink until an expected gold-medal showdown against the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. is in the back of our minds," Jennifer Botterill said.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadians were a little disappointed that they didn't get more
shots past Trunova. But their team clearly played at a higher level
than Kazakhstan.</TE>
<TE>   Hayley Wickenheiser had two goals and an assist.</TE>

<HD>Rose Bowl May Need NFL Team to Stay Afloat</HD>
<DH>Pasadena: With Galaxy soccer team leaving, officials seek
ways to keep the stadium viable. Critics call it a long shot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying they need to ensure the Rose Bowl doesn't become an empty
landmark, Pasadena City Council members on Monday voted unanimously
to seek a major new tenant, possibly an NFL franchise.</LD>
<LD>   City officials stressed that a pro football team in Pasadena
remains just a concept, but one they must explore given their belief
that the National Football League will have a team in the Los Angeles
area in the next five years.</LD>
<LD>   An NFL franchise in a renovated stadium is the best way to ensure
that the 80-year-old landmark remains viable, according to a
three-year business plan submitted by the Rose Bowl Operating Co.
board.</LD>
<TE>   "If it is not us who attracts an NFL team, it will be someone else
with a new stadium, and that stadium, rest assured, will take all our
tenants," Councilman Victor Gordo said. "That would have a severe
impact on Pasadena's economy.... We'd be negligent not to pursue an
NFL team."</TE>
<TE>   But council members said any commitment to professional football
in the Arroyo Seco would come only after considerable review of
environmental, neighborhood and preservation issues.</TE>
<TE>   . "We've a responsibility to maintain the Rose Bowl's national
prominence," said Darryl Dunn, general manager. "An NFL team as a
major tenant is the best way to make that happen."</TE>
<TE>   The aging Rose Bowl, which has hosted five Super Bowls, would
require extensive renovations to lure an NFL franchise from another
major city. Despite recent renovations, its 46 suites are far from
luxurious, its amenities outdated and conditions generally crammed in
the 92,000-seat venue.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say it is a pipe dream because the stadium is too big and
outmoded.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it a longshot? Yes, we understand that," said William Thomson,
Rose Bowl board member. "But it's enough of an opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   NFL owners in 1999 rejected stadiums in Carson and Hollywood Park,
as well as a revived Los Angeles Coliseum, and awarded an expansion
franchise to Houston. Houston billionaire Bob McNair bid $700 million
and a new $310-million stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Thomson said NFL officials have told city officials that a
renovated, state-of-the-art stadium would be capable of drawing an
NFL team.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena, according to the plan, would not put up public money but
would seek private financing for the team and renovations.</TE>
<TE>   "If the NFL is coming here, it won't be through taxpayer funding,"
Pasadena Councilman Paul Little said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors of the Rose Bowl aren't expected to allow the NFL in
their backyard without a fight. Norman Parker, president of the Linda
Vista Annandale Assn., a residents group on the Arroyo's west rim,
said the city cannot insulate the neighborhoods from air and noise
pollution that 1 million fans would bring each year.</TE>
<TE>   While a new management team at the Rose Bowl has won over many
neighbors, Lee Zanteson, an officer of the residents association,
said any move to bring an NFL team would face a legal challenge.</TE>
<TE>   With one of the Rose Bowl's major tenants, the L.A. Galaxy soccer
team, departing for a new 20,000-seat stadium in Carson next year,
Dunn said, the Rose Bowl cannot afford inaction.</TE>
<TE>   "What happens if a new stadium is built in L.A.?" Dunn asked. "We
could lose the UCLA football to that stadium. And the concerts and
other events would follow."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn told The Times recently after
talks with the NFL that he is open to supporting potential sites in
the city other than the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as the other stadium is the Coliseum, we believe UCLA
won't go there," Dunn said. "But any other stadium and all bets are
off."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's contract with the Rose Bowl expires at the end of the 2003
season. Signing the Bruins to a long-term contract is Dunn's top
priority.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want the Rose Bowl to become the Orange Bowl," Gordo
said, referring to the Miami stadium. He noted that even the Orange
Bowl games these days are played in Miami's modern Pro Player
Stadium, home of the NFL's Miami Dolphins.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena has invested $32 million over the last 10 years in
improvements at the Rose Bowl. The adjoining city-owned Brookside
golf course pays the bond debt for that renovation, which is about
$2.5 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl Operating Co., a nonprofit group that operates the
stadium and golf course, had a net profit of $1.3 million in the last
fiscal year, which ended June 30.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, there were 22 events at the Rose Bowl. This year, there
may be close to 30. However, the departure of the Galaxy will mean
the loss of about $500,000 in revenue, stadium official say.</TE>
<TE>   To offset that loss, the business plan calls for more
international soccer games and music events. The council on Monday
approved a deal for another international soccer game and Wango
Tango, a one-day June concert sponsored by radio station KIIS-FM.</TE>

<HD>Teamsters Seeking to Represent the LAPD</HD>
<DH>Labor: Campaign is seen as referendum on Police Protective
League's effort to remove Parks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND and JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the nation's largest and brawniest labor unions--the
Teamsters--is launching a campaign to represent Los Angeles police
officers and, in the process, decertify the Police Protective League.</LD>
<LD>   The Teamsters' effort, which will be announced today, comes at a
politically volatile time as the league works to remove LAPD Chief
Bernard C. Parks, who is seeking a second five-year term.</LD>
<LD>   A group of about 200 officers backing the Teamsters so far
generally support Parks and oppose the league's lobbying, said
regional Teamsters head Jim Santangelo.</LD>
<TE>   "It's about the chief, and it's about the representation they're
getting from the league," said Santangelo, president of the Teamsters
Joint Council 42, which has about 120,000 members.</TE>
<TE>   League President Mitzi Grasso said the union leadership is
"confident the Teamsters will not be able to take us over....</TE>
<TE>   "The Teamsters have a very poor record of representation in law
enforcement in California and [on] the West Coast," Grasso said. "It
is an industrial union with no experience representing law
enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which has about
1.5million members nationwide, represents 297 law enforcement
agencies across the country, said spokesman Rob Blackwell.</TE>
<TE>   Members include 400 Nevada state troopers who affiliated two
months ago, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn this month opposed Parks' reappointment,
citing unhappiness among the Los Angeles Police Department's rank and
file with the chief's leadership.</TE>
<TE>   The union battle could be seen as a referendum on officers'
sentiments about Parks and the league's opposition to him. The league
represents about 8,200 of the LAPD's 8,910 officers.</TE>
<TE>   Santangelo said about 10 officers went to the Teamsters nearly a
year ago to ask for organizing help. Since then, he said, they have
been joined by about 200 others.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Teamsters will begin distributing blue pledge cards to
gauge support for the switch in representation.</TE>
<TE>   A month ago, as the Teamsters campaign gained momentum, the league
affiliated with the AFL-CIO after 75 years as an unaffiliated union,
a move that many saw as an attempt to stop the larger union.</TE>
<TE>   The national federation protects member unions from raids by other
member unions through an official adjudication process. The league
plans to file a complaint under that process, Grasso said.</TE>
<TE>   Santangelo said the affiliation was not done properly, and AFL-CIO
would not stop the Teamsters, one of its largest affiliates.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as our attorneys are concerned, this isn't a raid," he
said, using the official term for the prohibited activity.</TE>
<TE>   Ground Rules for Campaign</TE>
<TE>   Santangelo said he and other Teamsters met with LAPD
representatives Monday to work out ground rules for the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   He said department officials initially wanted to ban officers from
wearing Teamsters T-shirts or buttons while off duty, but later
agreed to allow it.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to shut us down," Santangelo said of the LAPD
leadership, "but we're not going into this lightly."</TE>
<TE>   Blackwell claimed the Teamsters would have more clout to bargain
strong contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "The LAPD has seen attrition of its officers," he said. "They have
lost officers to suburban police departments that have better wages,
benefits and hours. So this attrition made those officers think that
maybe we could get a stronger contract with the Teamsters."</TE>
<TE>   Cmdr. Gary Brennan, a spokesman for the LAPD, said the issue would
remain a matter for the unions and the officers to work out.</TE>
<TE>   "The department's position is it's going to stay out of it," he
said.</TE>

<LD>A Santa Monica man who helped hijack a Soviet jetliner 32 years ago
pleaded not guilty Monday in Superior Court to charges that he
murdered his father.</LD>
<LD>   Albert Victor White, 46, formerly known as Algirdas Brazinskas, is
accused of bludgeoning 77-year-old Pranas Brazinskas in their
apartment on Jan. 5.</LD>
<LD>   Officials say the father and his son, who was then 13, hijacked
the plane over the Soviet Union in 1970. The father said he was
trying to escape the Soviet Union because he faced death as a member
of a Lithuanian resistance group. In a gun battle with guards on
board, a flight attendant was killed.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of San Fernando Valley residents urged a commission Monday to
redraw the 2nd City Council District in a way that will keep
candidates Wendy Greuel and Tony Cardenas in the same district.</LD>
<LD>   Residents complained that they might find, when the new districts
take effect, that whichever candidate they chose in the March 5
election no longer represents them.</LD>
<LD>   But the chairman of the Los Angeles Redistricting Commission
unveiled a plan that would include Greuel and Cardenas in the same
redrawn district, which would stretch from Sunland-Tujunga to Van
Nuys. That should prevent the redistricting plan from becoming an
issue in the March election, Chairman John Emerson said.</LD>

<LD>A former Oxnard accountant has been sentenced to nine years in state
prison for embezzling more than $1 million from two charities that
raise money for mentally disabled residents.</LD>
<LD>   Paul E. Peachey, 61, owned a company that for 18 years provided
accounting services for thrift stores run by the Foundation for
Retarded Citizens of Ventura County and the Santa Maria Assn. for the
Retarded Foundation.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said that, over a nearly four-year period, he altered
checks made out to him or his company and used some of the money to
build a 5,400-square-foot home on 20 acres in Tulare County.</LD>
<TE>   The Ventura County Superior Court judge also ordered Peachey to
pay $880,000 in restitution to the charities.</TE>

<LD>The parents of a missing San Diego girl who vanished from her bedroom
more than a week ago offered a $25,000 reward Monday for information
leading to her return.</LD>
<LD>   Brenda and Damon van Dam said they hoped the offer would help
sustain national attention on the case and lead to a breakthrough in
the investigation.</LD>
<LD>   The family has not seen 7-year-old Danielle since Damon van Dam
put her to bed Feb. 1. She was discovered missing the next morning.
Police believe she was abducted.</LD>

<HD>Cheating Death With a Rare Life</HD>
<DH>Service: Benny Hernandez--beyond terminal--spreads hope.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first time doctors expected Benny Hernandez to die, he was 3
months old and had a severe case of pneumonia. The infant had no more
than three days left, doctors predicted.</LD>
<LD>   His parents took him home and prayed. And he lived.</LD>
<LD>   His devout father told him in the years that followed: "God had a
plan for you. He has given you life, more than once. Twice."</LD>
<TE>   Now, the Anaheim Union High School District trustee, famed for
unseating an incumbent after spending $8.13 on his campaign, is
living under another death sentence. It was issued in January 2001,
when doctors told him an aggressive brain tumor would leave him six,
eight, maybe 12 weeks to live. So Hernandez, 45, quit his job as a
sixth-grade teacher in Compton and vowed to use his remaining time to
touch the lives of others.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen months later, Hernandez travels all over Southern
California, giving inspirational talks to community groups, schools
and churches. He tells people that each day is worth living, no
matter how many--or few--we are granted. He still attends school
board meetings when his health allows, and may run for Anaheim mayor.
Not that the medical news is good. Doctors have gone through his
skull twice to remove two tennis-ball-sized tumors. A third tumor is
growing fast.</TE>
<TE>   Two months after his election to the school board, Hernandez's
first tumor came with a headache so severe it forced him into the
emergency room.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, tests revealed the fast-growing, cancerous tumor. It
was the worst kind, glioblastoma multiforme, with tentacles that dig
so deep into the brain they can never be completely removed. Doctors
wasted no time; within a few days, they performed surgery that left
Hernandez with a scar the shape of a lucky horseshoe. And they told
him the bad news.</TE>
<TE>   His mother and older brother, in Colorado, put their lives on hold
to move closer to him.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Hernandez says he and his younger brother maintained a so-so
relationship for years. As he prepared to spend his brother's last
days with him, he thought, "How close can I get to Benny in 12
weeks?"</TE>
<TE>   But the news didn't seem to devastate Benny Hernandez as it did
his family. After surgery, he immediately started planning for the
future, as if he didn't comprehend his fate. The surgeon pulled Henry
Hernandez aside and told him: "I don't know if your brother
understands the seriousness of this. On a scale from one to four,
four being most serious, my take is that he's on five."</TE>
<TE>   Henry Hernandez is still with his brother.</TE>
<TE>   But while Benny Hernandez's tumors have not killed him, they have
taken away many of the skills he once took for granted. Until
Hernandez later regained some of his motor skills, his brother helped
dress him and escort him to countless meetings. Henry Hernandez has
provided the doctor with the difficult, honest updates on how his
brother is doing. No, Benny Hernandez often doesn't remember what day
it is. Yes, he needs to be reminded two, three, sometimes four times
a day.</TE>
<TE>   In other ways, though, Hernandez is full of life. "I want to spend
my last days reaching out to other people," he said. "I think that's
the greatest reward.... I will keep going until my last breath."</TE>
<TE>   He is visiting every school in Anaheim. There, he tells children
to go to college, get educated. Be somebody. When he talks in
churches, he jokes that the tumor is God's way of making him pray and
meditate more. He has lunch and dinner with friends. On many days, he
is up early and out late.</TE>
<TE>   The one thing that makes him cry is his wish to have more time
with his son, Alex, 8, whose birthday he marked by bringing a cake to
school and singing.</TE>
<TE>   In May, after 12 weeks of radiation treatment and about the time
doctors originally thought he would be dead, Hernandez took the trip
of a lifetime. An old college friend, Kathy Lopez, had heard about
the tumor. She tracked him down, renewed their friendship. As a
social worker, she was fascinated by Hernandez's attitude. "It just
kind of drew me to him," Lopez said. "I would go to church to hear
him. I had to be there all the time, be around somebody who was so
positive."</TE>
<TE>   She asked if there was anywhere he wanted to go but hadn't been.
He mentioned the Great Wall of China. She blurted out, "I'll take
you."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez is still awed by the social touch Hernandez displayed on
that trip, striking up conversations with strangers everywhere they
went. He wore T-shirts with such legends as "I'm too sexy for my
hair" (referring to his bald and scarred pate) and "God's in
control." Everyone became an acquaintance: the tailor, people on the
bus, tourists on a Yangtze River cruise and in shops where he bought
back scratchers and tacky souvenirs.</TE>
<TE>   A few months later, by the end of summer, the second tumor was
causing new problems. Hernandez lost peripheral vision and motor
skills. He couldn't walk without a cane. In September, surgeons cut
out two tumors that had merged into one. But the operation was a
success and much of Hernandez's mobility was restored.</TE>
<TE>   He believes it is the power of God, prayer and love. And maybe the
two cups a day of medicinal Chinese tea made from mushrooms, supplied
by a man in Laguna Beach who had heard about Hernandez's illness.</TE>
<TE>   Still, his driving days are over, and he walks slowly, his eyes
sweeping back and forth in front of him to compensate for the loss of
peripheral vision.</TE>
<TE>   In his pocket, he carries a computer organizer. He frequently
pulls it out, checking his schedule and looking for phone numbers. It
has a calendar full of dates he thought he'd never see: his 45th
birthday last month, his son's eighth birthday. There was even a
joking entry for systems shutdown, set for a day earlier this month.
That was the most recent day doctors had told Hernandez he could not
expect to live beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Now, in considering a run for mayor of Anaheim, he envisions an
active approach--walking the precincts, knocking on doors--though it
is unclear how much his health would allow.</TE>
<TE>   Raised a Seventh-day Adventist, Hernandez was performing in a
musical trio with his brothers by age 4. Called the Little King's
Heralds, they played the accordion and sang hymns, booked almost
every weekend at churches in Southern California and Mexico and
appearing on religious television shows.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez was always the straight kid, the do-gooder, his brother
said, the one who never even tried a cigarette. In school, at La
Sierra University and Cal State Long Beach, he was active in
community groups and professional associations.</TE>
<TE>   It was typical of Hernandez to become a social worker after
college, corralling wayward youth and setting them up with jobs or
finding college counselors for them. He liked working with kids so
much, he decided to become a teacher and run for the Anaheim
elementary school board. He served on that board before making two
unsuccessful bids for the high school board.</TE>
<TE>   On his third try, in 2000, he didn't campaign until the last
minute, after a friend called him to say she had 70 of his old
campaign signs gathering dust in her garage. He went to Target,
bought some electrical ties and, with his son, hung the signs up on
fences in Cypress. All in all, he spent $8.13--and finally won.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, The only aspect of death that makes Hernandez cry is the
thought of leaving his son, Alex, who turned 8 last month. On Alex's
birthday, Hernandez delivered a cake to his son's classroom and, with
one arm around Alex's shoulders, sang "Going Home."</TE>
<TE>   Alex looked up at his father and wiped his eyes. He crossed the
fingers on both hands in that common child's signal of wishing, and,
as if that weren't enough, he crossed his arms over his chest. Later,
he said, he was making a wish that his father would not cry. When he
blew out the candles, he made another wish. But he would not share
that secret.</TE>
<TE>   Alex lives in Los Angeles with his mother, who never married
Hernandez.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could spend more time with my boy," Hernandez said,
wiping tears from his eyes. "And I just hope that all the love that
has come my way, that he will receive the same love from everyone. I
hope I can teach him how to give love, to receive love."</TE>
<TE>   The third tumor is growing. The doctor said to pray that it grows
outward, where the doctor can grab it. Hernandez replied: "I'll grow
'em. You scoop 'em."</TE>
<TE>   During the latest appointment, the doctor didn't issue an opinion
on the amount of time Hernandez has left. Hernandez never listens
anyway.</TE>

<HD>El Toro Senior Is Killed in Crash</HD>
<DH>Fatality: High school student's car shears a telephone pole
and tree on Live Oak Canyon Road. Two passengers are also injured.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blake McGill loved to laugh, loved to cook and loved to drive--fast.</LD>
<LD>   The popular 17-year-old El Toro High School senior often took his
car into Trabuco Canyon to drive the tight curves of Live Oak Canyon
Road, and early Sunday morning, that's where his life ended.</LD>
<LD>   McGill was heading south on Live Oak near Monastery Road when he
lost control of his car shortly before 12:30 a.m., California Highway
Patrol Officer Denise Quesada said. Authorities said that stretch of
road, which snakes through the canyon, is a tempting but deadly
highway.</LD>
<TE>   Officers said McGill was trying to negotiate a curve when his car
slammed into a telephone pole, shearing it off at the base, and then
rammed a tree.</TE>
<TE>   The canyon road has a posted 35-mph speed limit and police said it
appeared the young driver was speeding.</TE>
<TE>   Two passengers--Matt Grabot, 16, of Mission Viejo, and Jeremy
Block of Lake Forest--suffered moderate injuries and were taken to
Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center, authorities said. McGill
died at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday afternoon, more than two dozen of McGill's friends and
classmates gathered at the crash site--some crying, others standing
in silence as they stared at the twisted metal of a fence damaged in
the wreck. They placed heart-shaped balloons, flowers, candles and
notes around a white cross adorned with a photo of McGill--smiling
and raising a cup to the camera.</TE>
<TE>   Classmates said that McGill--a football player whose height and
bulk belied his gentle nature--had an infectious, toothy grin and a
sense of humor that could win over anyone.</TE>
<TE>   "He would just say certain things that would get you going, and
you couldn't stop laughing," said Justin Gautier, 18, a senior who
played on the football team with McGill.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Rolf, 18, said his classmate was the kind of guy others went
to when they needed cheering up.</TE>
<TE>   "He was always laughing," Rolf said. "And he had no enemies.
Everybody loved him."</TE>
<TE>   Word of McGill's death spread quickly in the Lake Forest
community. Eddie Randall, 18, said a friend called early Sunday to
break the news.</TE>
<TE>   By Monday morning the news had swept the campus. A banner was hung
in the campus and about 400 students gathered during morning break to
listen to their classmate's favorite Bob Marley songs. Students
scribbled notes on the banner.</TE>
<TE>   "You could always make me laugh," one student wrote. "Time stopped
today," read another.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial assembly is planned Friday at the school.</TE>
<TE>   The outpouring of emotion came as no surprise to Kim Ogle, one of
McGill's teachers: "He walked into class every day with a smile on
his face."</TE>
<TE>   Ogle said McGill once won thunderous applause from classmates when
he read them a sonnet he had written about breaking up with a
girlfriend. A copy of the poem lay among the mementos at the crash
site.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I'm better off alone," the poem read, "with the wind at my
back and the sun on my face."</TE>

<HD>Crews Tame Canyon Blaze as Winds Die</HD>
<DH>Nature: Containment likely on Wednesday for wildfire near
Anaheim Hills. Damage to region's rare species probably not severe,
experts say.</DH>

<LD>Santa Ana winds diminished considerably Monday, helping firefighters
battle a brush fire that swept through a wilderness area over the
weekend, scorching 2,400 acres near Anaheim Hills.</LD>
<LD>   The fire was about 35% contained and no longer spreading, said
Kymbra Fleming, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Fire Authority.
Full containment is expected by 6 p.m. Wednesday, she said.</LD>
<LD>   "It's burning in very steep, rugged terrain that is not easily
accessible," Fleming said. "They are fighting it with hand crews, but
they don't expect it to grow in size, and they don't expect it to
reach any populated areas."</LD>
<TE>   About 1,000 firefighters have been battling the blaze, which
started about 9:15 p.m. Saturday in Coal Canyon, a rugged wilderness
area stretching east of Anaheim Hills through Chino Hills State Park
between the Eastern toll road and the Riverside Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Driven by Santa Ana winds gusting to 70 mph, the fire quickly
consumed much of the area's thick scrub, but never threatened human
life or property, Fleming said.</TE>
<TE>   By Monday, winds were less than 15 mph. Fire crews "are fairly
confident that they are going to be able to hold it to 2,400 acres,"
Fleming said Monday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Although firefighters said the cause of the blaze was under
investigation, environmental activists who have battled for decades
to preserve Coal Canyon received an e-mail Monday from Chino Hills
State Park Supt. Ron Krueper, blaming the fire on a fallen power line
at the Riverside-Orange County line.</TE>
<TE>   "Due to the high winds, the fire 'hopped' southwest into the back
area of Coal Canyon," the e-mail read.</TE>
<TE>   Because the area is home to rare or endangered species of plants
and trees, biologists were at the scene Monday to evaluate damage,
said Ken Pimlott, a spokesman for the California Dept. of Forestry
and Fire Protection.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, Pimlott said, the burned land hosts one of the
world's four remaining stands of Tecate Cypress, a species once found
throughout the Southwest. Other shrubs and flowers common to the area
are Riversidian sage scrub, dudleyas and Braunton's milk-vetch.</TE>
<TE>   Initial indications were that environmental damage may not be
severe. "It was a very mosaic burn," Pimlott said, "and it didn't
burn completely. There is still vegetation ... I wouldn't say it's a
serious impact."</TE>
<TE>   The largest and most famous of the trees, christened "Big Mo" by a
would-be real estate developer several years ago, was burned only on
its lower branches, Krueper's e-mail said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities' bigger concern is that the blaze could be a harbinger
of fire risk to come. "Any time you have Santa Ana winds with as
little rain as we've had, it makes things very dry and hazardous,"
Fleming said. "I think it's just a reminder that we live in an area
where ... we have to be careful. When we get Santa Ana winds as
strong as they were on Saturday night, it poses a problem."</TE>
<TE>   No more high winds are expected this week, she said.</TE>

<HD>Argentina Lets Peso Float Freely</HD>
<DH>Economy: Currency avoids a plunge, dipping 5% in value. Product
hoarding continues amid fears of inflation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>Following days of uncertainty, hoarding and repeated calls for
calm, Argentina allowed its currency to float freely against the dollar
for the first time in a decade Monday. The peso slipped slightly in value
but did not suffer the free fall many feared.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of people lined up outside exchange houses in Buenos Aires,
the capital, where the dollar sold for about 2.1 pesos, a drop of about
5% from the peso's unofficial value Friday. The day of relative calm
represented an important--if temporary--victory for the government of
Eduardo Duhalde, which is struggling to rescue Argentina from economic
collapse.</LD>
<LD>   In the hours before trading opened, officials repeatedly assured
nervous Argentines that if necessary the central bank would use some of
its $14 billion in cash reserves to keep the value of the peso at "a
reasonable level."</LD>
<TE>   Since a partial devaluation Jan. 11, the peso has traded at two
levels: an official rate, 1.4 to the dollar, for most government
transactions, and a free-floating rate set by the market. The government
now has, in effect, allowed the market to set one peso rate.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "the government will not sit with its arms crossed, doing
nothing," Anibal Fernandez, Duhalde's chief of staff, said Monday morning
on a radio show. "The government will intervene as is necessary to defend
the peso."</TE>
<TE>   The full peso devaluation comes as the government tries to end months
of economic instability and social unrest that have seen five presidents,
a freeze on many banking transactions and daily street protests.
Unemployment has surged, hitting 22% this month.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's closing rate represents a 52% drop in the peso's value
compared with December, when it traded one-for-one with the dollar.
Argentina's decade-long policy of keeping the peso equivalent to the
dollar nearly bankrupted the country and helped lead to the rioting that
brought down President Fernando de la Rua on Dec. 20.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm coming to buy [dollars] because it's not clear what's going to
happen next," said Isabel Pessoa, 35, as she waited outside an exchange
house. "I prefer having dollars because it's always the most sure thing
to have."</TE>
<TE>   Fears of a new round of hyper-inflation sent Argentines scurrying to
supermarkets to hoard foodstuffs and household items, including cooking
oil, sugar, pasta and cleaning goods.</TE>
<TE>   Inflation reached 3.6% just in the month of January. Prices for a wide
range of consumer goods, from apples to computer supplies, have risen
even more dramatically in the past week.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a fever of price increases," said Miguel Fernandez
Madero of Proconsumer, a consumer protection group. "We have good reason
to fear prices will skyrocket in the coming week."</TE>
<TE>   Even domestically produced vegetables now cost 30% more than they did
last week, Fernandez said. The price of disposable diapers has increased
27% over the same period. Many computer products are unavailable, he
said, because many retailers are refusing to sell products in
anticipation of a rise in the dollar's value.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is speculating, trying to take advantage of the situation,"
said shopper Ruben Villareal as he left a grocery store where he stocked
up on sugar and cartons of cookies.</TE>
<TE>   "What's happening here is a symptom of what's wrong with Argentina,"
store manager Gerardo Abrieta in the northern suburb of San Isidro said
of his empty shelves. "There is no confidence in anything. We don't know
if the peso will find a floor or fall to pieces. The uncertainty is
total."</TE>
<TE>   Despite fears of widespread social unrest, Monday saw only the
protests that have become part of daily life. Unemployed workers blocked
several roads leading into the capital, forcing hundreds of commuters to
walk into town.</TE>
<TE>   Officials continued to work Monday on a plan to reopen banks and
reduce government spending. Such a plan is considered vital to securing
assistance from the International Monetary Fund and other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Economy Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov is set to meet today in
Washington with the IMF and U.S. officials, including Treasury Secretary
Paul H. O'Neill. Remes hopes to secure an aid package of as much as $25
billion.</TE>
<TE>   IMF Managing Director Horst Kohler issued an encouraging statement
Friday, saying Argentina's move to a fully free-floating currency was a
positive step. But Argentina may have to cut its budget further before it
gets such an aid package.</TE>
<TE>   The government has already taken some cost-cutting measures. It
announced Saturday that it would close 21 embassies--a quarter of its
worldwide total--and 15 consulates. The Senate is also preparing a bill
to cut legislators' salaries, trips and vehicle usage.</TE>

<HD>Orthodox Angry at Vatican's Plans for Dioceses in Russia</HD>
<DH>Religion: Leaders denounce the decision as a violation of territory
and call it a blow to the churches' emerging ties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>The Vatican announced Monday that it will establish four formal
dioceses within Russia, touching a theological nerve and sparking a round
of condemnations from the Russian Orthodox Church, which accused the
Roman Catholics of violating its "canonical territory."</LD>
<LD>   The decision may prompt a temporary freeze in relations between the
two churches, said Metropolitan Kirill, chairman of the Russian Orthodox
Church's external relations commission.</LD>
<LD>   He said it was "absolutely clear that the decision has dealt a blow to
the improvement of the relationships between our churches that had just
started to take shape."</LD>
<TE>   Catholic emissaries had privately informed the Orthodox patriarchy of
the plan Friday, but the decision to form dioceses in place of "apostolic
administrations" established by the church during Soviet times was
formally announced Monday.</TE>
<TE>   At the Vatican, church spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the move
was prompted by "the need to improve the pastoral assistance to the
Catholics present in that vast region, as they have insistently
requested."</TE>
<TE>   "Today's decision of the Holy See to raise the apostolic
administrations [in Russia] to the level of proper dioceses is just
bringing the structure of the Catholic Church in Russia back to normal.
Nothing else," said Archbishop Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz, the Catholic
apostolic administrator in Moscow.</TE>
<TE>An Infringement of the Orthodox View</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 1.3 million Catholics live in Russia, according to the
Vatican, but Kondrusiewicz put the figure at about 500,000 within
Russia's population of 144 million.</TE>
<TE>   Most Catholics in Russia are of German, Polish, Lithuanian or
Belarussian descent; some in Siberia descended from political exiles in
czarist and Soviet times. A smattering of foreign Catholics, including
Filipinos, Koreans and Africans, work or study in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   But for the Orthodox hierarchy, the establishment of dioceses is an
infringement of its view of Russia as its own "canonical territory." From
the Orthodox perspective, there cannot be dual spiritual authorities in a
given place.</TE>
<TE>   "If in the past there was only some moderate presence of the Catholic
Church in Russia, then starting today there in fact is an alternative
church here, a new church," said Archpriest Vsevolod Chaplin, an Orthodox
spokesman. "Our attitude toward this move is exactly the same as the
Catholics would have to us appointing an alternative pope of Rome."</TE>
<TE>   Kondrusiewicz pointed out that the Vatican has been amenable to
Orthodox dioceses being established in predominantly Catholic countries.</TE>
<TE>   "Take Poland, for instance," he said. "I cannot say exactly how many
[Orthodox] dioceses there are now today, but there are about half a
dozen."</TE>
<TE>   Even though only about 200 Catholic parishes are scattered across
Russia, compared with well over 10,000 Orthodox communities, the Orthodox
fear that the Catholic Church intends to recruit new members.</TE>
<TE>   A range of sharp disagreements between the two churches has prevented
Pope John Paul II, 81 and ailing, from fulfilling an often expressed wish
to pay an ecumenical visit to Russia during his papacy. The Russian
Orthodox patriarch, Alexy II, has refused to issue an invitation and
protested last year when John Paul dared to visit Ukraine and Kazakhstan
without the Orthodox church's consent.</TE>
<TE>   President Vladimir V. Putin said last month that he would host the
pope if the Vatican and the Russian Orthodox Church ever managed to
resolve their disputes, but Orthodox leaders say that is increasingly
unlikely.</TE>
<TE>Historical Distrust Seen as One Root of the Rift</TE>
<TE>   Geraldine Fagan, a correspondent in Moscow for the Britain-based
Keston Institute, which monitors religious freedom in the former Soviet
Union, said the two churches' rift is fraught with historical distrust.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, she said, the Russian Orthodox Church considers all
Russians part of its flock, whether or not they espouse a belief in God
or attend church regularly. Any contact between Russians and the Catholic
Church, therefore, is considered proselytism.</TE>
<TE>   Another friction has been the rapid resurgence of the Catholic Church
in Ukraine. Since the fall of communism 10 years ago, the Eastern-rite,
Greco-Catholic Church has been reclaiming believers, churches and
property that had fallen into the hands of the pro-Moscow Orthodox church
in western Ukraine after that region came under Soviet control during
World War II. To the Catholics, it is a correction of a historical
injustice; to the Russian patriarch, it amounts to Catholic expansion.</TE>
<TE>Decision Seen as One More Insult</TE>
<TE>   A religious affairs expert with the patriarch's publishing house said
that, for the Orthodox, Monday's announcement was one more insult by the
West against Russia.</TE>
<TE>   "The way the Catholic Church acted falls in line with the
traditionally harsh policies of the Vatican toward the Russian Orthodox,"
said the expert, who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   The animosities reach back centuries, Fagan said.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds almost ridiculous, but if you talk to those Russian
Orthodox who are virulently anti-Catholic, if you ask them why, within a
couple of minutes they will be telling you about the Crusades of 1204.
They are not looking at today, at the modern world--they immediately go
back to the Middle Ages."</TE>

<HD>Israel Strikes Palestinian Compound in Gaza</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Second day of air raids comes in response to Islamic
militants' use of new longer-range rocket.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israel launched a second day of retaliatory airstrikes on the Gaza
Strip on Monday, attacking a security compound housing imprisoned Islamic
militants as politicians debated how best to respond to the Palestinians'
first use of a new rocket.</LD>
<LD>   Right-wing ministers clamored for the government to oust Yasser Arafat
and destroy his Palestinian Authority. But Defense Minister Binyamin
Ben-Eliezer backed away from earlier warnings that Israel would respond
massively to the use of the Kassam-2 rocket.</LD>
<LD>   "I said that it would be hard to put up with this," Ben-Eliezer said
of the rockets, whose range of roughly five miles makes them a threat to
cities in the heart of Israel's coastal plain. "The meaning of this is
that we'll try to deal with this in various ways--intelligence,
interception and operations" to destroy suspected missile factories,
Ben-Eliezer told a committee of the Knesset, Israel's parliament.</LD>
<TE>   The target Monday was a large, walled quarter of Gaza City known as
the Saraya compound, headquarters of the Palestinian military
intelligence and general security service.</TE>
<TE>   Apache helicopters carried out Monday's first strike shortly before
noon as the morning session of the school day ended and the afternoon
session began. Hundreds of schoolchildren were on streets crowded with
pedestrians when the first missiles slammed into the compound.</TE>
<TE>   As people scattered in panic, a pillar of black smoke rose high above
the burning complex. Rescue workers and others rushed to the scene, only
to dive for cover when Israeli fighter jets swooped in, firing a second
round of missiles. Palestinians reported that several of the compound's
buildings were set ablaze.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City reported that 37 people were
injured. Many were hit by flying glass and other shrapnel, including
Denver photographer George Kocheniec and two other journalists.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of angry Gazans converged on the compound and demanded the
release of prisoners kept there, many of them affiliated with the
militant Islamic group Hamas. Palestinian police fired in the air to
drive the mob back. Police sources later said they moved some prisoners
to keep them safe from further Israeli attacks.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher criticized Israel's
bombing in populated areas, warning that it could intensify the fighting.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank, relatives of prisoners held in a Hebron jail stormed
the building Monday, freeing an unknown number of detainees. Palestinian
police reportedly did not resist the assault.</TE>
<TE>   The airstrikes in Gaza were a familiar Israeli response to a
Palestinian attack; the same security compound has been hit before.
Although Monday's strikes were unusual because they were carried out
midday, they were not the sort of dramatic, conflict-transforming
retaliation that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Ben-Eliezer had said
would come if the Palestinians dared to use the Kassam-2.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the relatively limited Israeli response may be that the
rockets fired Sunday fell into a field in the Negev desert, causing no
injuries and little damage. The Israeli warnings have mostly focused on
what would happen if the Palestinians hit an Israeli town or city.</TE>
<TE>   But military analyst Alex Fishman, writing in the Yediot Aharonot
newspaper, offered another explanation. Israel's hand, he said, "is not
free," because the Bush administration has warned Sharon against
escalating the fight with the Palestinians as the United States considers
how to deal with Iraq. President Bush has labeled Iraq part of the "axis
of evil" that the U.S. intends to tackle in its war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush will not let anyone set the region ablaze and undermine the
messianic task that he has taken upon himself, to root out evil from the
world in general and from Iraq in particular," Fishman wrote.</TE>
<TE>   But if Ben-Eliezer hinted that Israel will limit, for now, its
response to the threat from the Kassam-2 rockets, other Cabinet ministers
called for all-out war on the Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   "Our final goal should be to destroy the Palestinian Authority's
military capability and to break the terrorists' and the Palestinian
leadership's will to fight us," said Uzi Landau, public security
minister. "These things will be achieved through our continuous,
extensive and unrestricted action."</TE>
<TE>   Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Sharon's chief rival in the
Likud Party, told Israel Television that Sharon's policies have failed.</TE>
<TE>   "We must exact a price," Netanyahu said in an interview Sunday. "If
you get rid of this regime, you are telling the person who comes next,
'Watch out.' "</TE>
<TE>   Netanyahu said that Sharon "is doing too little too slowly." The only
solution to nearly 17 months of fighting with the Palestinians, Netanyahu

<HD>White House Signals Willingness to Resolve Differences With Iran</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: U.S. is open to dialogue in hopes of pressing reformers
to stand up to religious hard-liners, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Despite the escalating war of words between the United States and
Iran, the Bush administration has sent a strong signal through diplomatic
back channels that Washington is still interested in resolving
differences through dialogue, senior administration officials said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The message was conveyed, the sources said, shortly after President
Bush's State of the Union address two weeks ago, in which he labeled Iran
one of three nations in an "axis of evil."</LD>
<LD>   "If Iran wants to set a clear course toward the modern world, we're
happy to talk to them, work with them," State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher said Monday.</LD>
<TE>   The overture marks a new U.S. tactic. Increasingly concerned about
Iran's advanced weapons programs, the administration has decided to take
a policy gamble and press Tehran's reformers to stand up to religious
conservatives who have thwarted democratic openings, closed down the
independent press and imprisoned pro-democracy activists over the past
five years.</TE>
<TE>   "The president's message to Iran is that it's time to choose," said a
senior State Department official who asked to remain anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   But the overture may not be enough to quell the hostile public
reaction to the Bush administration's recent string of criticisms. In one
of the biggest demonstrations in years, hundreds of thousands of Iranians
took to the streets of Tehran on Monday, carrying anti-American banners
and burning effigies. The strident scene at Freedom Square was
reminiscent of the early days of Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.
State-controlled television reported that millions turned out in other
cities.</TE>
<TE>Big Crowds Seen as Reply to 'U.S. Insults'</TE>
<TE>   President Mohammad Khatami, the country's leading reformer, heralded
the turnout as a signal of Iran's reply to "U.S. insults and trumped-up
charges," he said. Khatami had called on Iranians to join the rallies,
which marked the 23rd anniversary of the revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Just months after his election in 1997, Khatami called for cultural
exchanges and a "dialogue of civilizations" to help bring down the "wall
of mistrust" between Tehran and Washington. In contrast, on Monday he
suggested that U.S. policies were the cause of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "The American people have every right to ask their leaders how long
should they pay the price for their faulty policies. What policies and
what reasons caused the Sept. 11 attacks?" he said to the crowds, which
often interrupted him to shout, "Death of America!"</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said Monday that they are not worried about the fallout
from Khatami's provocative remarks, interpreting them as a predictable
political reaction.</TE>
<TE>   "He has to cover his flank," said the State Department official. "He
doesn't want to appear to be too soft. We don't consider this to be a
reversal of any kind."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is instead focusing on a strategy aimed at
resolving the power struggle between reformers and religious hard-liners
in Iran. All of the Islamic Republic's traditional elected government
branches, including the presidency, have religious counterparts that have
final veto power over everything from elections to candidates to
legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's State of the Union speech pointed to this rift, calling Iran a
nation that "exports terror while an unelected few repress the Iranian
people's hope for freedom." And in congressional testimony last week,
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell openly talked about the problems
created by Iran's two rival power centers: a popularly elected government
and the conservative unelected clerics.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials say they do not want to play the factions
against each other or fragment power in the country. Their goal is to
"support the aspiration of the Iranian people," expressed in four
elections since 1997 that were overwhelmingly won by reformers, according
to a senior U.S. official.</TE>
<TE>   The administration hopes to "help strengthen" the reformers by talking
publicly about Tehran's recent misadventures; among other things, it is
accused of secretly shipping 50 tons of arms to the Palestinians and
undermining the new Afghan government by aiding a regional warlord.
Washington believes that top Iranian officials are not fully aware of all
the actions taken by the Intelligence Ministry and the Revolutionary
Guards, both of which are under the control of religious hard-liners.</TE>
<TE>   "Khatami says all the right things on Afghanistan. We could get along
perfectly fine with his state policies. But the reformers don't control
the others and often don't know what they do," the administration
official said.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech Monday, Khatami conceded that there were "many
differences" among Iran's leaders, a reference to the power struggle, but
he said the country is united in supporting the cause of the 1979
revolution.</TE>
<TE>Reformers Have Been Put on Notice, U.S. Says</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials also contend that leading Iranian reformers
have conveyed their understanding of recent U.S. actions--and said they
are not unhappy that the United States aired problems that reformers are
reluctant to make public.</TE>
<TE>   As an incentive, the United States is holding out the prospect of
dialogue. "Obviously, the preferred method remains to be able to sit down
. . . for a serious discussion and talk about Iran and the course it
might go on," Boucher said.</TE>
<TE>   But the United States has also put Iran's reformers on notice that
their failure to prevail on the critical issues facing their nation will
force the administration to begin looking for others to support, U.S.
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We intend to help in this way, but if it undermines or hurts the
reformers, then it's an indication that they're too weak a reed and maybe
we should look at the next generation, the youth, the women and the
elements of civil society," said the senior U.S. official.</TE>

<LD>A Buddhist nun has become the first female monk ordained in
Thailand, presenting a serious challenge to the nation's all-male clergy.</LD>
<LD>   Varanggana Vanavichayen, 55, was ordained Sunday by a female Sri
Lankan monk in the presence of a male Thai monk. Theravada scriptures, as
interpreted in Thailand, require that for a woman to be ordained a monk,
the ceremony must be attended by a male and female monk.</LD>
<LD>   Monks are the main clerics in Thai Buddhism. The deputy chief of the
government's Religious Affairs Department, however, said Varanggana will
not be recognized as a monk.</LD>

<DH>Mideast: Ex-Cal State student is to be hanged for millennium
scheme. But prosecutors fail to prove any link to the Al Qaeda network.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO
</DL>
<LD>A San Jose-born man was sentenced to be hanged Monday after a
Jordanian military court found him guilty of plotting to blow up tourist
sites during millennium celebrations. But the court acquitted him of
being linked to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.</LD>
<LD>   For the second time, Jordanian prosecutors failed to convince a
military judge in a state security court that Raed Hijazi, 33, was
affiliated with Al Qaeda. That verdict underscored the difficulty U.S.
prosecutors could face in trying to draw hard connections between
suspects now in custody and Bin Laden's organization.</LD>
<LD>   But Chief Judge Tayel Raqqad found that there was sufficient evidence
to convict--and execute--the former Cal State Sacramento business student
for scheming to blow up sites that attracted Jewish and American tourists
during New Year's Eve celebrations in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   "Where is God's will? Why are you sentencing me to death?" Hijazi
shouted after the verdict was read. "You are ruling against your people.
[Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon doesn't sentence his people to
death."</TE>
<TE>   Had prosecutors succeeded in linking Hijazi to Al Qaeda, that might
have helped quell some of the skepticism that remains in the Arab world
concerning Bin Laden's responsibility for the Sept. 11 attacks in the
U.S. Many people in this region believe that the attacks were part of an
Israeli conspiracy to undermine the Palestinian uprising. U.S.
authorities had said there was evidence connecting Hijazi to a man
arrested in Chicago who had direct links to the hijackings.</TE>
<TE>   Raqqad, however, said there was no evidence that Bin Laden's network
has had any formal structure or membership in Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   "You are found guilty of conspiracy to carry out terrorist attacks in
Jordan, and your punishment is the death penalty," the judge told Hijazi,
a father of three who holds U.S. and Jordanian citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   When Jordanian security agents broke up what they say was a terrorist
cell in late 1999, Hijazi was in Syria. At the initial trial, five
co-defendants and Hijazi were convicted of plotting the attacks but were
acquitted of being connected to Al Qaeda. Hijazi was sentenced in
absentia. After he was captured and extradited, he was granted a new
trial. Prosecutors used the opportunity to revisit the issue of links to
Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Hijazi's lawyer said Monday that he will appeal the verdict and the
sentence, a process that could take several years.</TE>
<TE>   "The important sentence to me is that they dismissed charges of any
relation with Al Qaeda, and this is an essential part of the case,"
Muhammad Hijazi, 67, the father of the condemned man, said in a telephone
interview from Jordan. "The sentence is unjust and is inhuman. He did
absolutely nothing against any human being. . . . If he really wanted to
attack U.S. targets, he would have done that there [in the U.S.]. Why
would he come all the way over here to do that?"</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Hijazi confessed to his involvement in the plot,
although he later said the confession was beaten out of him. Court
records paint a detailed portrait of Hijazi's activities and link him
directly to bomb-making material and weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Hijazi was introduced to radical Islamic ideas in 1991, when he met a
Fijian militant while studying business at Cal State Sacramento,
according to court papers. Five years later, prosecutors said, he went to
Syria, where he met a militant who helped him craft a plan for building a
terrorist cell in Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors alleged that Hijazi and his co-conspirators worked
together for years saving money, buying weapons and building and testing
explosive devices. At one point, officials said, Hijazi worked as a taxi
driver in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   The millennium plotters' goal was apparently to attack New Year's
revelers at Jordan's Mt. Nebo, where biblical tradition says Moses saw
the Promised Land, and at a site along the Jordan River where Jesus is
said to have been baptized.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors charged that Hijazi received weapons and explosives
training at an Al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan and bought weapons in Iraq,
including Kalashnikov rifles. But the core of the government's case
rested on the allegation that Hijazi and another man rented a house in
which to store materials used in making explosives.</TE>

<HD>New Governor Named for Strife-Torn Province</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: The move may reignite tribal clashes after deadly
battles last month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The interim government Monday appointed a new governor of Paktia
province, setting up a possible new showdown with the previous governor,
who had fought a bloody battle with a rival warlord.</LD>
<LD>   In announcing Taj Mohamad Wardak as the governor of Paktia, in eastern
Afghanistan, Gen. Deen Mohammad Joorat, chief of the national security
department, blamed neighboring Pakistan for the unrest that has swept
Paktia.</LD>
<LD>   Joorat said Wardak, who replaces former Gov. Bacha Khan, was an
influential figure who could rule the province peacefully.</LD>
<TE>   Wardak served as governor of the northeastern province of Badakhshan
in the 1970s and is seen as a supporter of Afghanistan's former king,
Mohammad Zaher Shah, who was ousted in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   The appointment was made a day after Khan said he would oppose any
move by interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai to replace him.</TE>
<TE>   Khan vowed to recapture the provincial capital, Gardez, 60 miles south
of Kabul, the Afghan capital. He was forced out of the city by fighters
loyal to rival commander Haji Saifullah after two days of clashes late
last month.</TE>
<TE>   The violence highlighted problems Karzai faces in uniting the country
and imposing stability as old tribal and ethnic rivalries emerge after
the defeat of the Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   The fighting in Gardez broke out when Khan tried to disarm loyalists
of Saifullah, who claims to have been chosen as governor by the town's
tribal council. More than 50 people were killed in the clashes.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai accused Khan of starting the fighting with heavy-handed
tactics, but Khan warned that there would be more trouble unless he was
returned to power.</TE>
<TE>   "Fighting will erupt if they [Saifullah's forces] do not evacuate the
area. . . . We are ready to take it any time," Khan said. "If Karzai
takes the decision of appointing another governor, then he will confront
problems in other provinces."</TE>
<TE>   In Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates on Monday, Karzai called for more
international peacekeepers to protect his government from challenges from
tribal leaders.</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Train Yemeni Soldiers in Hunt for Al Qaeda Suspects</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SANA, Yemen
</DL>
<LD>The United States does not expect to deploy combat troops in Yemen
to hunt for suspected Al Qaeda terrorists, but it will help train Yemen's
military, the head of the U.S. military's Central Command said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   On a visit to Sana, the Yemeni capital, Gen. Tommy Franks discussed
military and security cooperation with President Ali Abdullah Saleh.</LD>
<LD>   Asked if Washington was ready to send troops to Yemen, where at least
two Al Qaeda suspects wanted by the United States are reportedly hiding,
Franks said, "I don't think at this time we have any expectation of
putting U.S. combat troops here on the ground."</LD>
<TE>   He said Saleh had not asked for U.S. combat troops but was interested
in military training and assistance in creating a coast guard to help the
Yemenis protect their coastline.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has been pushing Yemen for greater cooperation on
anti-terrorism since the October 2000 attack on the U.S. destroyer Cole
in the Yemeni port of Aden.</TE>
<TE>   Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, has committed
itself to joining the U.S. war on terrorism. But Yemeni officials say
this cannot be done without U.S. training, military assistance and aid.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, President Bush asked Congress to reward America's new
friends in the war against terror. Just $2 million in military aid was
earmarked for Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the government-run Yemen Observer reported a comment from
an unidentified Defense Ministry official saying the amount was "a big
joke."</TE>
<TE>   Yemen's government admits Al Qaeda suspects may exist in the country,
but it says the network has no military training camps or any other
organized presence.</TE>
<TE>   At least two terror suspects believed to be in Yemen, Qaed Salim
Sunian Harethi, allegedly a top Al Qaeda official, and Mohammed Hamdi
Ahdal, are wanted by the United States in the Cole attack.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen soldiers and six tribesmen were killed in December when
Yemeni special forces trained with U.S. help pushed into a tribal region
where the two were suspected to be hiding. Yemen's government has said it
is negotiating with tribes that may be sheltering the pair but that it
will use force if they are not turned over peacefully.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Bush
spoke by telephone with Saleh just after Franks' visit.</TE>
<TE>   Bush "expressed appreciation for the Saleh government's recent efforts
to deny terrorists use of Yemeni territory," Fleischer said.</TE>

<LD>Sixty leading intellectuals, mostly high-powered academics who
study ethics, religion and public policy at American universities and
think tanks, will issue an open letter today explaining why they believe
the war on terrorism is necessary and just.</LD>
<LD>   "There are times when waging war is not only morally permitted, but
morally necessary, as a response to calamitous acts of violence, hatred
and injustice. This is one of those times," the letter says.</LD>
<LD>   Among the signers of "What We're Fighting For: A Letter From America"
are ex-senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), now a professor at
Syracuse University; Francis Fukuyama of Johns Hopkins University; James
Q. Wilson of UCLA; and Samuel P. Huntington and Theda Skocpol of Harvard.</LD>

<HD>New Year's Isn't the Same in New York's Chinatown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>The narrow streets will be jammed with cars today and the festive
Lion Dance Parade will again lure huge crowds into lower Manhattan as New
York's historic Chinatown celebrates New Year's.</LD>
<LD>   But appearances are deceiving in a community that was devastated by
the Sept. 11 attacks. Thousands of workers who live here lost their jobs
after the nearby twin towers fell and businesses closed. Phone service
has yet to be fully restored and tourism has fallen off dramatically.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a slight economic rebound, some observers fear that growing
pressure to convert failing businesses into upscale offices and
condominiums may eventually turn New York's Chinatown into an ethnic
theme park like Little Italy--a tourist destination that was once a
gritty, vibrant neighborhood where immigrants lived and worked.</LD>
<TE>   "We all tend to feel hopeful at the New Year celebration, because it
may bring us new signs of life," said Paul Lee, whose family has run the
32 Mott Street general store since 1891. "But business is so bad, I might
not be here next month. The front door could be locked soon. Right now, I
think every business, every employee in New York's Chinatown is
vulnerable."</TE>
<TE>   More than 100,000 jobs were lost in New York after the attacks, most
of them low-income positions in the apparel, hotel and restaurant
businesses, according to a study by the New York-based Fiscal Policy
Institute. Many lower Manhattan communities suffered huge economic
setbacks after Sept. 11, but Chinatown's troubles were unique.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to driving out tourists, the attacks disrupted a fragile
economy in Chinatown--an insular world where residents patronized local
stores and each segment of the community helped support the others.</TE>
<TE>   Factory workers shopped in a local grocery; the travel agency owner
dined in a neighborhood noodle shop. All were linked, and if this chain
ever broke, it could destroy Chinatown's identity as a bona fide
neighborhood, according to Benjamin Warnke, director of the Renaissance
Economic Development Corp., which is spearheading revival efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The interdependent economy has been traumatized, he said, "and some
people fear we may never quite put it together again. You might see a
large number of businesses begin to close here right after the Lunar New
Year."</TE>
<TE>   Other stores may simply relocate to newer Chinatowns in Brooklyn and
Queens. Either way, Warnke said, a community of more than 100,000 people
is in danger.</TE>
<TE>   Restaurants, jewelry stores, travel agencies and souvenir shops have
been hard hit. But the area's 250 garment factories suffered the biggest
economic blow. Many had to shut down for weeks after Sept. 11, because
trucks could not drive through the debris-ridden streets to make
deliveries.</TE>
<TE>   More than 12,000 people worked in the factories, and 7,000 lost jobs
when their shops closed or laid off a large segment of the work force,
according to May Chen, who heads the local chapter of the garment workers
union.</TE>
<TE>   "These workers were the economic backbone of Chinatown," she said.
"And it's not clear how well we can retrain many of them. This is an
economic battle that will involve the future of our whole community."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the displaced garment workers were older Chinese women, a vast
majority of whom do not speak English. The factories were losing business
to foreign competition long before the terrorist attacks, Chen noted, and
it is even harder now to find work for these women in a deepening
recession.</TE>
<TE>   Agnes Wong, who worked as a seamstress for 30 years in Chinatown
before losing her job on Sept. 11, is trying to improve her language
skills in courses offered by UNITE, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial
and Textile Employees. But as she pondered her job prospects on a recent
afternoon in the union's Chinatown office, she echoed the sadness of many
workers.</TE>
<TE>   "None of us wants welfare," said Wong, 58. "We want to work. And when
you lose your job, you feel hopeless. I think that I have lost my way."</TE>
<TE>   Merchants on Mott Street, the economic center of Chinatown, offered
similarly downbeat views. Although festive red and gold banners for New
Year's hung on storefronts, along with American flags, the mood was grim.</TE>
<TE>   "How bad is business? It's down 60%," said Gary Lum, who works in Wing
on Wo, an antiques shop. ". . . A lot of shopkeepers worry about simply
surviving."</TE>
<TE>   Once, store owners could count on a huge influx of customers who
worked at the World Trade Center and frequently came to Chinatown for
lunch.</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly, the World Trade Center isn't there, and all of these people
are gone," said Eddie Cheung, a salesman at the Sinotique antique store.
"A whole bunch of customers disappears overnight. What do you do?"</TE>
<TE>   As economic woes increased last fall, Chinatown leaders began lobbying
federal officials for emergency aid. The U.S. Department of Labor
responded with a $1-million grant for job training and worker
re-education, and the local agencies administering Operation Jump Start,
as it is known, are hopeful that Chinatown will somehow ride out the
economic slump.</TE>
<TE>   The program offers businessmen wage subsidies to retrain workers. But
it's hard to hire female garment workers who are 55 and can't speak
English, said David Chen, executive director of the Chinese-American
Planning Council, which is helping to administer the grant.</TE>
<TE>   Some predict a troubling future for the community, he said, and as
with so many things in Manhattan, it's all about real estate values.</TE>
<TE>   If the economic crunch worsens, fewer residents will spend money in
shops and restaurants, he noted. Shopkeepers will find it hard to pay
rents. Soon, property owners seeking a better return on investments will
consider turning their downtown real estate into more lucrative
condominiums and co-ops.</TE>
<TE>   Gentrification has transformed other lower Manhattan neighborhoods,
and Little Italy--directly adjacent to Chinatown--may be the prime
example. Once a thriving ethnic enclave, it has been shrinking in size
over the years, replaced by shops that, ironically, were part of an
expanding Chinatown.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Little Italy is primarily a tourist magnet, with thousands
pouring in to visit street fairs, religious ceremonies and restaurants.
And some wonder if an economically humbled Chinatown may face the same
fate.</TE>
<TE>   These are grave concerns for Paul Lee, whose quiet store is the oldest
in Chinatown. But nowadays he has more urgent problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to borrow money to pay my bills now, and I'm holding off
creditors as best I can," he said. "I ask for extensions every week."</TE>
<TE>   As he spoke, an elderly Chinese woman came into the store waving a
telephone bill. Ping Chow Chai's service had yet to be restored, five
months after the attacks, and she asked Lee to call the phone company for
her.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm tired of playing the victim, because after a while you don't want
to get out of bed," he said. "But you know what? We're victims here."</TE>

<HD>Danger Found in Trade Center Air</HD>
<DH>Science: Researchers discover extremely high levels of pollution.
'Situations like this just don't exist' in most of the world, project
leader says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Smoke and dust from the destroyed World Trade Center buildings
exposed residents of lower Manhattan to weeks of some of the highest
levels of air pollution ever studied, a team of California scientists
reported Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Carefully analyzed samples of air collected about a mile from the
World Trade Center site in the weeks after the attacks show
extraordinarily elevated levels of tiny particles laced with soot and
metals, the researchers said. Fires smoldering in the rubble turned
glass, concrete and computer equipment into an aerosol fallout that was
far more intense and persistent than expected, they added.</LD>
<LD>   "No one has ever reported a situation like the one we see in the World
Trade Center samples," said Tom Cahill, an atmospheric physicist at UC
Davis and the leader of the project. "In New York City and in most of the
world, situations like this just don't exist."</LD>
<TE>   Cahill and his colleagues report finding almost no asbestos and very
little lead in the air--two pieces of good news for worried New Yorkers.
They also found that the pollution levels had dropped sharply by late
October. But those reassurances for many in the city may be outweighed by
the intensity of the pollution the researchers did find: weeks of very
high levels of sulfur and sulfuric acid, titanium, nickel and minute
particles of silicon from pulverized glass and concrete.</TE>
<TE>   For many of the pollutants, the exact health effects are unknown. But
recent studies have shown that tiny particles can penetrate lungs and be
absorbed into the bloodstream. Exposure to particles has been linked to
elevated rates of cancer, heart attacks and asthma.</TE>
<TE>   The condition of New York's air in the aftermath of the trade center
disaster has been the subject of heated political debate for months. The
federal Environmental Protection Agency has said their studies showed air
in Manhattan was safe. But many New York residents and politicians and
the EPA's own ombudsman have suggested the agency has improperly
downplayed health concerns.</TE>
<TE>Independent Study Widens Debate</TE>
<TE>   The new research represents the first publicly available assessment
from independent, university-based researchers. The findings quickly
exacerbated an already irate debate.</TE>
<TE>   "We now know enough to be alarmed and outraged at the federal
government's response to the environmental impact of 9/11," said Rep.
Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), whose district covers much of the affected area.</TE>
<TE>   "The EPA has created a full-scale crisis of public confidence," Nadler
said at a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing called to
examine the government's response to New York's pollution exposure.</TE>
<TE>   EPA spokeswoman Bonnie Bellow declined to comment on the findings,
saying agency officials had not been able to read and review the
research.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognize people have concerns, and we are concerned about
people's safety," Bellow said.</TE>
<TE>   Cahill, however, said the EPA failed to identify more air pollutants
over a wider area because the techniques and equipment it used do not
capture the tiniest particles, which the agency's own scientists have
acknowledged are the most hazardous.</TE>
<TE>   "The EPA could have identified these particles within a couple of days
if they looked for them, but they didn't," Cahill said.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers from California, who have extensive experience
analyzing airborne pollutants, collected air samples in Manhattan at the
request of the Energy Department from Oct. 2 to mid-December. Rainstorms
washed out most of the large particles, they found. But large masses of
tiny specks remained airborne until the fires were extinguished in late
October.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists collected particles continuously for three months and used
seven tests to sort them based on color, size and chemical composition.
They scanned particles with lasers and electron microscopes at Davis and
the Energy Department's Lawrence Berkeley and Lawrence Livermore national
laboratories to determine their chemical compositions.</TE>
<TE>   The results showed that the level of particles in New York's air
outdid even the worst pollution from the Kuwait oil field fires.</TE>
<TE>   The main problem was tiny particles, which can penetrate deep into the
lungs and enter the bloodstream. New York particle pollution
concentrations were 50 times greater than those found in California's San
Joaquin Valley, one of the smoggiest places in the nation, Cahill and his
associates reported.</TE>
<TE>Harmful Particles Slip Indoors</TE>
<TE>   While the widespread pollution from the fires has ended, scientists
who conducted the research say danger has in many cases moved indoors.</TE>
<TE>   The particles, many of them more than 100 times smaller than the
diameter of a human hair, easily slip past windows and doors and collect
on drapes and carpets. Confined inside apartments or offices, they can
pose a long-term health risk unless properly removed.</TE>
<TE>   "These particles are ultra-fine and can suspend in the air for a long,
long time. They behave more like a gas and are hard to remove," Cahill
said.</TE>
<TE>   While the exact health risk is uncertain, many New York residents have
refused to move back into apartments or offices. Parents have refused to
send children back to schools near the trade center site until they are
convinced the air is safe.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers endorsed recommendations from the New York City Health
Department that New Yorkers wipe all interior surfaces with wet cloths
and avoid vacuuming or sweeping.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be extremely careful moving into indoor space or else you
will re-suspend these particles for a very long time," Cahill said.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Rescue Workers Move to Sue Over Respiratory Damage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>More than 1,300 people, mostly firefighters who toiled in the
smoldering rubble of the twin towers, have notified New York City they
may sue for damages stemming from the attack on the World Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   The claims, a necessary first step before lawsuits can be filed
against the city, alleged the firefighters and other workers were exposed
after Sept. 11 to "dangerous levels" of toxins, PCBs, benzine, lead,
chromium, copper, asbestos, sulfur dioxide, fiberglass and other toxic
and carcinogenic chemicals.</LD>
<LD>   The exposure was the result of "negligence, carelessness and
recklessness" in not providing rescue workers with proper protective
gear, including respirators and other breathing apparatus, the legal
papers charged.</LD>
<TE>   Many of the firefighters said in the claims that they suffered from
cardiopulmonary and respiratory ailments including a constant cough,
burning lungs, trouble swallowing and other injuries, the full extent of
which are still unknown.</TE>
<TE>   In October, the Fire Department arranged for a group of firefighters
to undergo a specialized breathing test at Montefiore Medical Center in
the Bronx. Physicians found 25% had airway irritation.</TE>
<TE>   The percentage remained the same when the tests were repeated in
November and December.</TE>
<TE>   Approximately two-thirds of the firefighters with positive results in
October continued to show irritation. In addition, 13% of those who
tested normal in October showed irritation, according to the study.</TE>
<TE>   "The continued presence of airway irritation in a sizable number of
participants on this repeat test raises the question of whether this
irritation will persist for longer time periods," wrote Dr. David
Prezant, the Fire Department's pulmonary expert, in a letter to the
firefighters who took part in the study. "If the hyperreactivity persists
for longer time periods, this may represent irritant asthma."</TE>
<TE>   "Without further evaluation, it is impossible to predict whether
airway irritation will resolve in persons currently experiencing it," he
added.</TE>
<TE>   The department is planning more tests in March.</TE>
<TE>   The possibility of lawsuits concerned former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani
and Gov. George Pataki. Both officials wrote to House Speaker J. Dennis
Hastert (R-Ill.) in the fall seeking a congressional cap on the city's
liability for recovery work at the trade center site.</TE>
<TE>   The airline security bill passed by Congress granted their request,
setting a liability limit of $350 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not suing about Sept. 11. We are suing about the month that
followed," said Jim McGarry, a principal partner in a Manhattan law firm
representing many of the firefighters. "During that time, the city of New
York and other agencies at ground zero failed to provide proper
respirators.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a fire marshal who was told, 'Your bronchial tubes are coated
with silica. Don't do any exercise whatsoever,' " McGarry continued. "I
have another fireman with acute asbestos scarring of the lungs. . . .</TE>
<TE>   "You have marathon runners who can't jog. You have fathers of 2- and
3-year-olds who can't carry their children down stairs," he added.
"People are scared."</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials admit a shortage of respirators existed after the twin
towers collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   "We had them in limited supply at the time of the attack," said Frank
Gribbon, a Fire Department spokesman. "As the days wore on, we ordered
them, and we had them delivered. . . . We do acknowledge initially they
weren't available."</TE>
<TE>   Gribbon said some workers decided not to wear the respirators or put
them on intermittently.</TE>
<TE>   More than 9,000 firefighters have been given comprehensive medical
examinations since the attack, he said, with "no significant elevations"
of lead, beryllium, mercury or other metals reported.</TE>
<TE>   The department spokesman said impairments ranged "from a mild cough or
irritation to more severe issues in the extreme, resulting in reduced
lung capacity." The majority have returned to work full time in
firehouses, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a couple of hundred people out on medical leave or on
restricted duty," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighter Philip DeMaria, 33, hasn't been able to work and belongs
to the group charging inadequate protection at the site.</TE>
<TE>   "The first couple of weeks, all we were given were paper painters'
dust masks," he said. "They don't help you for the exposure to asbestos
and other chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   "When they finally gave us the proper respirators, they didn't provide
the proper filters and instructions. The filters they were using were
supposed to be changed more frequently than they were telling us."</TE>
<TE>   DeMaria, who worked more than 12 hours at a time at the trade center
site, said he finally learned from an employee of the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration that the mask's filters should have been
replaced every four hours.</TE>
<TE>   He said hundreds of firefighters developed coughs, wheezing and
shortness of breath at the site. DeMaria said he contracted an infection,
asthma, coughed up blood for two months and lost his voice. His lung
capacity fell to below half its normal level, but with the help of
steroids and other medications, it is showing improvement.</TE>
<TE>   He badly wants to return to work.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a job. It's a way of life. It's a family," said DeMaria,
whose father retired as a fire lieutenant after 30 years. "I work in a
firehouse with 50 firemen and fire officers. Those are the people I
respect. I miss being in my firehouse."</TE>

<LD>It's not quite a case of making a silk purse out of a sow's ear,

<LD>When court clerks asked prison inmate Greg Gould Jr. to list his
occupation for a marriage license, he replied "criminal."</LD>
<LD>   It was part of a ceremony last month in the basement of Pennsylvania's
York County courthouse. "That was a joke. Did they write it down that
way?" asked Gould, 30.</LD>
<LD>   Gould married Valentina Marie Natasha Roberts, the mother of his two
children.</LD>
<TE>   Gould was convicted Jan. 10 of multiple robbery counts in a 1999 gas

<HD>Best Way to Tend Borders Escapes INS</HD>
<DH>Crossings: Officials are struggling to come up with a comprehensive
system to monitor entries and exits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In the hopes of politicians, it has emerged as one answer to the
challenge of international terrorism: keeping tabs on foreigners as they
enter and exit the United States. "It's important that we have good
information," President Bush said recently, "so we can secure the
homeland."</LD>
<LD>   Yet an array of obstacles still stands in the way of a comprehensive
"entry-exit" system as called for by many members of Congress and
endorsed by the White House. The Immigration and Naturalization Service
has yet to make some of the basic decisions about the demanding new task,
including how to prevent spectacular traffic jams at border posts.</LD>
<LD>   A complete system could require construction of many new exit gates to
process travelers leaving the United States, sparking environmental
concerns and difficult planning decisions at 153 crossings along the
Mexican and Canadian borders. And while some former critics are more
receptive to such controls since Sept. 11, business interests still fear
they could damage cross-border commerce.</LD>
<TE>   The Bush administration last week requested $380 million for a
"comprehensive" entry-exit system and set a target date of September 2004
for a program that would track hundreds of millions of border crossings a
year. But close observers question whether the federal government can
finish the project on time, and whether it will be as all-encompassing as
the White House has urged.</TE>
<TE>   "This idea is easier said than done," said Theresa Brown, manager of
labor and immigration policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "When you
start delving into what it really entails, it's a whole lot more
complicated than people might think."</TE>
<TE>   Immigration officials monitor all arrivals and departures by air and
sea--but they have no strategy to track departures by land. The approach
is widely seen as antiquated.</TE>
<TE>   Even inside the INS, officials concede that some of the most basic
issues remain far from settled. More than 505 million people entered the
United States last year through Mexico and Canada (including travelers
who came here more than once). Of the half-billion entries, more than
half were made by noncitizens.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to be going out to private industry to get ideas and
suggestions and to ask, 'If you had to track the entry and exit of all
these people, how would you do it?' " said Shonnie Lyon, a chief
inspector in the INS office of inspections.</TE>
<TE>   It is an ancient question. Congress called for all departing "aliens"
to be recorded on official manifests as long ago as 1907, according to
the INS. Yet it was not until 1996--as public concerns mounted about
terrorism and the booming population of illegal immigrants--that
lawmakers ordered the immigration service to come up with a modern plan
to do the job.</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, the proposed new border controls sparked a fierce
backlash. Border-state interests warned that long lines would trigger
economic chaos, disrupting tourism and other industries. Business
interests feared that new red tape would bog down the movement of cargo
at a time when manufacturers were demanding parts and supplies faster
than ever before. Merchants near Mexico and Canada complained that new
hassles in crossing the borders would keep customers out of their shops.</TE>
<TE>   A Detroit-area official once argued that if the INS needed an extra 30
seconds to process even half of the daily vehicles that crossed the
Ambassador Bridge between Detroit and Windsor, Canada, it would take so
much time as to "effectively close the bridge."</TE>
<TE>   Besieged with complaints, the INS abandoned plans three years ago to
try out the approach at the border crossing in Eagle Pass, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time you increase the amount it takes to do an inspection or
check the driver, you're backing up traffic--and that creates major
problems," said Martin Rojas, director for cross-border operations for
the American Trucking Assns.</TE>
<TE>Technology May Not Be Up to the Task</TE>
<TE>   Congress postponed the mandate in 1998 and again in 2000, when it
sought to ease the economic anxieties by prohibiting the new system from
adding paperwork. Under current law, the system would be in full effect
by 2005, a schedule that the White House wants to speed up by a year.</TE>
<TE>   Truckers are prepared to help establish a workable plan that addresses
the needs of border security, Rojas said. But he voiced the widespread
doubts: "We're going to have to see--I don't really think the technology
is there yet."</TE>
<TE>   The challenge appears greatest at land borders. Jets and ships already
collect passenger manifest information. But tracking departing motorists
represents an entirely new challenge, in part because U.S. land borders
were designed to inspect entrants, not those who are leaving.</TE>
<TE>   At the busy entry point of San Ysidro, 24 gates await travelers
entering the United States from Mexico; only two exist for those who are
heading south of the border. Stephen Gross, chairman of the San
Diego-based Border Trade Alliance, which advocates international trade,
warned that without a major expansion of facilities, "you'd have a line
that was 10 hours long."</TE>
<TE>   Such concerns have long slowed progress on a plan. But the politics
all changed after Sept. 11, when the INS was embarrassed by its lack of
readily accessible records for the 19 hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed new system would have quickly accessible records of
noncitizen arrivals and departures. Advocates say this information could
be used in concert with other government databases, creating a new
potential to tip off officials when foreign visitors stay too long in
this country, and also helping catch those whose names are on terrorist
lookout lists.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're not supposed to be here more than a period of time, then
maybe you ought to just go on home," Bush said last week, suggesting one
use of the proposed system.</TE>
<TE>System of Magnetic Cards Considered</TE>
<TE>   For all that, INS officials have yet to make basic technical decisions
about how they would record entries and exits. The agency has considered
one technology in which at least some foreign travelers could record
their border crossings by swiping a magnetic card, and another in which
it would apply stickers with bar codes to vehicles that are driven across
the border.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, the INS has considered whether it should issue foreign
travelers cards that contain data in a radio signal.</TE>
<TE>   "As they pull up to the booth, the antenna reads the card," said Lyon,
describing such an approach as "a distinct possibility."</TE>

<HD>Pieces of U.S. History Pilfered</HD>
<DH>Theft: A National Archives employee is accused of selling artifacts
for $100,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE FIORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>It began when an astute federal worker was shopping on EBay and
came across a treasure that should not have been for sale anywhere, much
less an Internet auction house: a pardon signed by an American president.</LD>
<LD>   It ended Monday when a veteran employee of the National Archives was
charged with stealing priceless historical treasures and selling them on
the open market, including a pardon signed by Abraham Lincoln and an
autographed photograph of Neil Armstrong on the moon.</LD>
<LD>   Shawn P. Aubitz, 45, had worked at the archives' downtown Philadelphia
branch for 14 years, and part of his job was to sift through some of its
120 million pieces of history for display in rotating exhibits,
authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   But prosecutors allege that he spent three years pilfering as many as
100 American artifacts and selling them for an estimated $100,000, in
what is believed to be the first case of employee theft in the archives'
68-year history.</TE>
<TE>   The precise number of documents taken is not known and some of the
items that were sold have not been recovered, said Patrick L. Meehan,
U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not just value measured in dollars--these were authentic
documents, the actual records of events that ware part of our American
history, and when they are removed from the collection the value is
incalculable," Meehan said. "This wasn't just a crime against the
National Archives. This was a crime against future generations and their
access to American history."</TE>
<TE>   Aubitz was charged with one count of theft by a government employee
and faces a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a maximum
fine of $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Jody Hobbs said Aubitz "sincerely and fully regrets
his actions and believes he made a mistake in judgment. He has made every
attempt to assist in the recovery of the items."</TE>
<TE>   The stolen items included Civil War documents such as an 1863 warrant
to the U.S. marshal to seize Arlington House, the estate of Robert E.
Lee, which is now a national landmark atop a hill at Arlington Cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   There were slave trade documents, autographed photographs of
astronauts taken during Apollo and space shuttle missions and pardons
signed by a dozen presidents, James Madison and Andrew Johnson among
them.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps the most intriguing was a pardon signed by Lincoln,
considered particularly valuable because it is a rare example of his full
signature, as opposed to the abbreviated "A. Lincoln" he more commonly
used. The pardon is valued at $2,000; Aubitz allegedly sold it on EBay
for $12,000.</TE>
<TE>   "In these days when signatures of aging baseball players can have
great value, you can imagine the value of something signed by Abraham
Lincoln," Meehan said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors could not say which document was first spotted on the
Internet, but the report sparked an investigation that led to Aubitz's
termination in 1999 from the Philadelphia branch, where he worked as an
archivist. The National Archives is based in Washington and its satellite
office in Philadelphia maintains artifacts from parts of the country rich
with history, including Delaware, Maryland and Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   "He was in a position of trust," Meehan said. "He had a unique insight
into what would be valuable. He would be tutored in what were
historically interesting documents."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Robert Zauzmer said Aubitz is cooperating with
investigators but cannot remember exactly how many documents he took.
Investigators said they are contacting people in the business of buying
and selling American artifacts in hopes of tracking down the items.</TE>
<TE>   Documents have been stolen from the National Archives before, but
never by someone on staff, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, scholar Charles Merrill Mount was convicted of transporting
stolen historic documents, including letters from Lincoln and Winston
Churchill, that belonged to the National Archives and the Library of
Congress. Mount--who sported the mannerisms of an English gentleman--was
a biographer and former Guggenheim Foundation fellow who insisted that
the documents he sold to a bookshop belonged to him.</TE>

<HD>Waxman Seeks Inquiry of Enron's Political Ties</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Rep. Henry A. Waxman has doggedly pursued an investigation into
Enron Corp.'s political influence, but as a member of the House minority
without subpoena power, the Los Angeles Democrat has been able to go only
so far.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, he appealed to Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.), chairman of the
Government Reform Committee, to launch a probe of Enron's political
activities--and do it with the same zeal used to investigate President
Clinton's campaign fund-raising.</LD>
<LD>   "A company that seemingly operated through fraud managed to become one
of the most influential voices in Washington and a significant presence
for both parties," Waxman, the panel's top Democrat, said in a letter to
Burton.</LD>
<TE>   A Burton spokesman said the chairman had not seen the letter and would
respond later in the week.</TE>
<TE>   Although a dozen congressional panels are investigating Enron's
collapse, none is focusing on the fallen energy giant's political
activities, Waxman said. Since the 1989-90 election cycle, Enron's
officers, directors, employees and political action committees have
contributed almost $6 million to candidates and political parties. About
three-quarters of that amount went to Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   During the Clinton investigation, Waxman often assailed Burton's
efforts as partisan. Waxman chief of staff Phil Schiliro said his boss
was not seeking to limit the probe to Enron's ties to the Bush
administration. In fact, Waxman asked Burton to seek from Enron records
related to the use of its corporate jets by political candidates and
documents detailing Enron contacts with both the Bush and Clinton
administrations, as well as with members of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Waxman's request comes as former Enron chief Kenneth L. Lay is
expected to invoke his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination
today in his first Capitol Hill appearance since Enron filed for
bankruptcy Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   House Republican leaders began circulating draft legislation Monday
designed to address accounting and oversight weaknesses exposed by
Enron's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   The bill--similar to several other proposals--would amend the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by requiring that accounting firms be
subjected to review and sanctions by a newly created public regulatory
organization, which would report any conflicts of interest or quality
problems to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The draft bill would also require greater and faster financial
disclosure by publicly traded companies, including details about stock
sales by company insiders and off-the-books partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Another section would prohibit company officers and directors from
selling shares during a blackout period that restricts sales by employees
participating in a retirement program. And the bill would mandate more
regular reviews of financial statements by the SEC, particularly for the
largest U.S. companies.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee, said his boss plans to send a letter
to former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, asking him to "clear
up some of the perceived inconsistencies" in his congressional testimony
"as well as some of the discrepancies" between his testimony and that of
other witnesses.</TE>

<HD>Couple Plead Guilty to Aiding Illegal Immigrants From China</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>The head of one of the nation's largest immigration asylum law
firms and his wife pleaded guilty Monday to faking asylum applications to
help smugglers bring hundreds of Chinese into America.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Porges, 63, said he "personally approved every asylum
application" as he admitted to a conspiracy in which the Porges Law Firm
lied to help more than 1,000 immigrants stay in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   "I was aware that many of the stories submitted by the aliens were
either false, inaccurate or exaggerations," he said. "I deliberately did
not investigate."</LD>
<TE>   His description of his crimes before U.S. District Judge Denise Cote
was followed by a confession by his wife, Sheery Lu Porges, 49.</TE>
<TE>   She described helping smugglers in the kidnappings of 17 Chinese
immigrants since 1997 by telling them where they could find clients of
the law firm who promised to pay a fee to come to America.</TE>
<TE>   In return, the smugglers would ensure a steady stream of business from
immigrants seeking asylum in the United States, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The immigrants, who otherwise could not legally enter the United
States, agreed to pay between $40,000 and $50,000 to be brought to
America. The smugglers were sent to collect the fee after learning flight
plans from the law firm, Sheery Lu Porges said.</TE>
<TE>   She said the law firm also advised what routes should be used to
smuggle people into the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The couple entered guilty pleas to racketeering and tax evasion
charges under agreements that called for each of them to serve at least
six years and two months in prison. Sentencing was set for May 17.</TE>
<TE>   Sheery Lu Porges is pregnant with twins due in August, and a lawyer
for her said she would seek to avoid incarceration until after the
children are born.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. James Comey said the prosecution of the couple demonstrated
that immigrant smuggling had become a major focus of law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "With our nation now at war against terrorism, it has become an even
more critical concern," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Bronson, a lawyer for Robert Porges, said his client decided to
plead guilty rather than endure a trial after prosecutors offered deals
to about 10 of the law firm's employees and eight smugglers.</TE>
<TE>   He said the deals created a mountain of evidence that "just by the
sheer weight would have made a defense impossible."</TE>
<TE>   Bronson said his client was unjustly singled out for a practice that
was so common that advertisements in Chinese newspapers coaxed
prospective immigrants to contact law firms to perfect their asylum
applications.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sad case because he's a lawyer, 63 years old, and he's going
to jail for conduct which is conducted every day by people in this
business," Bronson said.</TE>
<TE>   As part of their plea, the couple agreed to forfeit $6 million,
including their Stamford, Conn., home and $2.1 million in cash seized
from the home and two safe deposit boxes after their arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Bronson said the firm that had been operated by the couple would
continue in business, though the couple would no longer be involved. The
firm had represented immigrants nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen former Porges employees were charged with racketeering, alien
smuggling or asylum fraud. Ten have pleaded guilty; one remains a
fugitive.</TE>
<TE>   The fraud was forcing the government to review as many as 7,000 asylum
cases.</TE>

<HD>Groups Urge Broader Colon Cancer Testing</HD>
<DH>Health: More Medicare coverage is needed to boost the screening
rate, experts say. Deaths in 2002 are expected to top 48,000, data show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Not enough elderly Americans are being screened for colon cancer,
even though Medicare often picks up most of the costs, according to
critics asking Congress to expand coverage.</LD>
<LD>   The American Cancer Society estimates that colon cancer will kill
48,000 people this year in the United States, more than any other cancer
except lung cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Congress passed legislation in 1997 that provided Medicare coverage of
colonoscopies for screening purposes, but a General Accounting Office
review of claims in 1999 found just 3.8% of Medicare patients had gotten
a colonoscopy that year. That's just 1 percentage point above 1995,
before Medicare began covering screenings.</LD>
<TE>   "Virtually every Medicare recipient should be screened for colorectal
cancer," Randy Fenninger, a spokesman for the American Society for
Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, said Monday. "The promise of the legislation
isn't being fulfilled."</TE>
<TE>   ASGE, the American College of Gastroenterology and other health groups
say the Medicare coverage rules discourage testing. For example, the
critics say, patients must exceed their deductible before Medicare will
pick up any of the costs. In addition, the program doesn't cover the cost
of the doctor's visit before the procedure.</TE>
<TE>   Under current law, a Medicare patient who undergoes a screening
colonoscopy as a hospital outpatient pays 20% of the roughly $205
doctor's fee, and, if the patient has reached his yearly deductible,
Medicare pays 80%.</TE>
<TE>   Legislation introduced in both the House and Senate would pick up 80%
of the cost whether or not a patient has reached the deductible and would
cover the patient's visit to the doctor before the procedure. It also
would raise to about $265 the maximum physicians could charge for the
test to qualify for Medicare reimbursement.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that the result will be more access to early detection and
treatment, and therefore we believe thousands of lives [will be] saved,"
said Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), a sponsor of the bill.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Sen. Pete V. Domenici returned to work Monday after spending five
days in a hospital for tests to determine the cause of steady pain in his
right elbow.</LD>
<LD>   The 69-year-old senator cast votes on two judicial nominations after
his release from Walter Reed Army Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   "I am very glad to be back at work," Domenici (R-N.M.) said in a
statement. "I am grateful to the doctors and staff at Walter Reed for all
they've done to pinpoint the source of this pain."</LD>
<TE>   Domenici injured his arm during a touch football game with his
grandchildren on Thanksgiving 1999. He was told at the time he had
pinched a nerve in his neck and has undergone continual therapy and had
two operations.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors now attribute the injury to a pinched ulnar nerve in the
senator's elbow. They do not believe that further surgery would help,
Domenici spokesman Chris Gallegos said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Thomas Larkin of Walter Reed's anesthesiology and pain management
department said it will take several weeks to get Domenici's medication
adjusted to control the pain without causing side effects.</TE>
<TE>   Gallegos said doctors have asked the senator to reduce his workload
this week.</TE>

<HD>Governor Pitches Utah as Home for Tech Companies</HD>
<DH>Business: Mike Leavitt holds seminars for executives, financiers,
hoping they will bring their offices to his state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>From an ornate ballroom inside the turn-of-the-century governor's
mansion here, the serious business of the Olympics is being conducted:
the business of selling Utah.</LD>
<LD>   At a series of high-powered seminars, Gov. Mike Leavitt is busy
pitching Utah as a haven for biomedical research and digital technology,
offering hard-to-come-by Olympic tickets to gain an audience with venture
capitalists and high-tech entrepreneurs.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a very clear message for them," Leavitt said of the hundreds
of financiers and Silicon Valley executives that he's invited to attend
the breakfast sessions.</LD>
<TE>   The spirited meetings are conducted by leaders from the academic,
business and political worlds and include five Cabinet members, the dean
of Harvard Business School and former U.S. Rep. Jack Kemp of New York.
The topics are wide-ranging, but the agenda is clear: Come do business in
Utah.</TE>
<TE>   "We are by most measures considered one of the top 10 technology
markets. We haven't had the exposure we need," Leavitt said, calling his
effort to attract business leaders "full-gear schmooze."</TE>
<TE>   It's not the hard sell some would expect. The state has nine public
colleges and four private universities, providing a highly educated,
tech-savvy work force. Utah is ranked sixth among all states for its
ability to adapt to the high-tech new economy, according to a study
released last year by the Washington-based Progressive Policy Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Utah's public schools are among the most wired, with 92% connected to
the Internet, 10 percentage points higher than the national average,
according to a national marketing study conducted last year. Nearly 70%
of Utah households have a computer, and in 2000 Dun &amp; Bradstreet ranked
Salt Lake City as the nation's No. 3 "high-tech hot spot."</TE>
<TE>   "The work force here is educated and computer literate," said Patrick
Byrne, CEO of Overstock.com, an online liquidator based in Salt Lake
City. He noted that Brigham Young University and the University of Utah
established computer science departments 20 years ago and have nationally
recognized research arms.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no problem finding computer-literate employees," he said.</TE>
<TE>Connecting With High-Tech Industry</TE>
<TE>   Byrne attended a recent seminar led by Kim Clark, dean of the Harvard
Business School, which featured a lively discussion of the digital
economy and the thorny world of genetic mapping. Clark paced in front of
a white board bearing the state's slogan for Leavitt's high-tech
initiative: "Utah, Where Ideas Connect."</TE>
<TE>   Leavitt, a 51-year-old Republican, is a tireless campaigner for his
state's position in the high-tech world. His seminars, gathering
investors to mix business with pleasure, appear to be having some impact.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been impressed with how progressive people are," said Bruce
McCaw, Seattle-based venture capitalist and CEO of Pistol Creek
Financial. McCaw said he came for the seminars, and attending Olympic
events was secondary. "You can see how this is an environment where you
can get things done. Business leaders like places where they can get
things done."</TE>
<TE>   Utah offers tax and other incentives to lure businesses, but the state
prefers to brag about its existing high-tech companies and
infrastructure. Among companies with offices here are Iomega Corp.,
manufacturers of Zip drives and portable storage devices for computers,
and Intel, which has a large research and development campus here.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to get the word out," Leavitt said. "We have one of the
largest cancer research centers here, we are the leaders in gene mapping,
there may be two or three places in the world that manufacture more
medical devices than we do. We don't want to be a place of the past, we
want to be a place of the future, that's why we're in biotech and new
technologies."</TE>
<TE>   Attracting money and companies to Utah is also not the chore it used
to be. The Olympics have not just opened a window to the state's natural
wonders, but also prompted the state to embark on a crash program to
upgrade its infrastructure. The airport, highways and public
transportation have all been expanded and modernized in the last two
years.</TE>
<TE>   Those are among the reasons Bruce Witte, the CEO of the international
printing company AlphaGraphics, moved his headquarters here last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Salt Lake is an undiscovered gem," Witte said. "Everybody
likes to think they are ahead of the curve--I am ahead of the curve by
relocating here. I tell every executive I know about Salt Lake and they
don't believe me. They'll learn. In my view, Salt Lake is the No. 1 city
to do business in in the United States."</TE>
<TE>Grand Ideas, Little Investment</TE>
<TE>   Some say, however, that Leavitt's enthusiasm for the initiative is not
backed by the financial muscle necessary to do the job.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor is working relatively hard on attracting high-tech
business, but the state is investing relatively small amounts of money in
the effort," said R. Thayne Robson, director of the Bureau of Economic
and Business Research at the University of Utah. He is also on the
governor's board of economic advisors.</TE>
<TE>   "I applaud the governor's program. What he's trying to accomplish is
great, but the money isn't behind it," Robson said. "Neighboring states
are spending more to attract that kind of business and offering them more
in the way of tax breaks and subsidies."</TE>

<HD>Bush's Prescription for Medical Reform</HD>
<DH>Policy: In remarks, the president emphasizes strengthening the
doctor-patient relationship and attacks trial lawyers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE
</DL>
<LD>America's health-care system is "in need of urgent reform,"
President Bush said Monday as he laid out an array of principles that he
said would provide greater patient choice, reduce costs and expand
coverage.</LD>
<LD>   "We must reform health care in America," Bush said in a speech at the
Medical College of Wisconsin. "We must build a modern, innovative
health-care system that gives patients more options and fewer orders and
strengthens the doctor-patient relationship."</LD>
<LD>   But the president offered few new specific ideas. Instead, he blamed
lawyers for many of the ills in the system.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the principles that he espoused here enjoy broad bipartisan
support in Congress, including a patients' bill of rights, but opinions
diverge over how best to achieve those goals.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who leveled a blast at Bush on Monday was Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy (D-Mass.), who was the president's key congressional ally on
education reform.</TE>
<TE>   "For senior citizens, the administration's budget is just another
broken promise. Its commitment to prescription drug coverage under
Medicare is less than for new tax breaks, less than the Republican
Congress supported last year, and far less than is needed to give the
elderly the protection they need," Kennedy said in a statement issued in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "Senior citizens deserve a real Medicare prescription drug benefit,
and they deserve it now," the senator added.</TE>
<TE>   After addressing an audience of several hundred supportive physicians,
Bush attended a fund-raiser for Wisconsin Gov. Scott McCallum, a fellow
Republican who became governor after Tommy G. Thompson resigned to serve
as Bush's secretary of Health and Human Services.</TE>
<TE>   It was the president's fourth post-Sept. 11 fund-raiser--a reflection
of his quickening pace of partisan political activities in anticipation
of the November elections. Last week, Bush attended two fund-raisers in
New York for Gov. George Pataki.</TE>
<TE>   With the control of both the House and Senate at stake, Bush is
scheduled to attend about 40 political events for Republicans around the
country.</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks here, the president did not immerse himself in the
nitty-gritty details of health policy, but he did spend a good deal of
time enunciating his broad goals.</TE>
<TE>   The details are in the budget that he released last week.</TE>
<TE>Breaking Down Where the Money Will Go</TE>
<TE>   Among them is $14 billion over the next decade to expand medical
savings accounts--tax-exempt accounts that individuals may create and use
to pay for most routine, out-of-pocket medical expenses short of
catastrophic illnesses. A number of states already have such accounts.</TE>
<TE>   These accounts, Bush said, would afford consumers greater control over
how their health-care dollars are spent. Other proponents say such
accounts can generate savings for employers, instill cost-consciousness
among consumers and create unprecedented competition among providers,
while granting unrestricted choice of doctors and eliminating
bean-counters from the physician-patient relationship.</TE>
<TE>   But opponents warn that the accounts attract mainly the young and
healthy, leaving sicker people with high-cost medical needs in
traditional insurance pools, causing premiums to soar and forcing some
into the ranks of the estimated 40 million uninsured Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's proposal would lower the deductible requirements for the
medical savings accounts and allow the funds to be used for preventive
care costs.</TE>
<TE>   "If part of reform is to restore the patient-doctor relation and to
give patients more choices, we have to change the tax system to encourage
and allow for patients to make decisions that [are] in their best
interests," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   For those who lack employer-based coverage, Bush is seeking $89
billion in his budget for "health credits"--$1,000 for individuals and
$3,000 for families--to buy insurance. Such credits would enable 6
million uninsured Americans to afford coverage, according to the White
House.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's budget also seeks $15 billion to help the newly unemployed by
paying 60% of the cost of their continued health coverage. This provision
would help 4 million displaced workers, the White House said.</TE>
<TE>   The president also called for pooling small businesses and individuals
into purchasing arrangements to increase their bargaining power with
insurance companies.</TE>
<TE>   The budget seeks $190 billion for Medicare, the medical insurance
program for older Americans, which the president called "antiquated."</TE>
<TE>   Bush complained, for example, that Medicare offers insufficient
coverage for preventive medicine. He also vowed to provide seniors with
coverage for prescription drugs, although he did not explain how.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got Republicans and Democrats and an independent from the
United States Senate working on Medicare reform," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also called for the creation of an additional 1,200 community
health-care centers in the next five years. There are already about 3,000
such clinics serving the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Bush became most animated when he called on Congress to enact a
patients' bill of rights. The GOP-controlled House and the
Democratic-controlled Senate have passed competing versions, with the
biggest differences over consumers' ability to sue medical providers.</TE>
<TE>   Bush came down squarely Monday on the side of the providers--and the
House bill, which contains far stronger limitations on the legal recourse
of consumers who believe they have suffered at the hands of insurance
companies or doctors or both.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's fierce anti-lawyer remarks likely set the stage for a huge
tussle with Democrats, who enjoy strong financial support from trial
lawyers all over the country.</TE>
<TE>   "We should be serving the interests of the patients, not the
self-interests of trial lawyers," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "Needless litigation . . . does incredible harm to our health-care
system. It costs everyone time and money, especially patients who need
care quickly, and can destroy the bond of trust between physician and
patient," the president added.</TE>
<TE>   "Frivolous lawsuits drive up insurance premiums for everybody,
discourage employers from offering employee coverage at all. It is really
important to remember that we want to help doctors to heal, not encourage
lawyers to sue."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "And the hostile legal atmosphere that doctors face is
adding to costs and undermining the quality of health care in practical
ways."</TE>

<HD>N.J. Killer Paroled After 38 Years</HD>
<DH>Crime: Thomas Trantino shot two policemen in '63. The state had
fought to keep him in prison.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAMDEN, N.J.
</DL>
<LD>A man convicted of killing two police officers in 1963 has been
released from a halfway house and is on parole after more than 38 years
in custody.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas Trantino, who turned 64 on Monday, had been the state's
longest-serving inmate. He spent most of his adult life in prison.</LD>
<LD>   His case inspired the state Legislature to pass two laws attempting to
ensure that no police killer would ever be paroled.</LD>
<TE>   Trantino had been rejected for parole nine times. But a year ago, the
state Supreme Court said the parole board lacked proof that he posed a
threat to society and sent him to a halfway house for a year.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Corrections confirmed that he had been released late
Sunday or early Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple of hours one way or the other don't matter," said Jerry Voto
Sr., the son of Peter Voto, one of Trantino's victims. "The point is,
he's out."</TE>
<TE>   Trantino's lawyer, Roger A. Lowenstein, said Trantino had a job lined
up and would most likely move to another halfway house in Camden.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a nonevent," Lowenstein said of the release. "He's
probably going to move from one halfway house to another."</TE>
<TE>   Trantino was sentenced to death for fatally shooting the officers in
Lodi, but the sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1972 after the
state's death penalty law was deemed unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   The two officers--Voto, 40, and Gary Tedesco, 22--were shot in August
1963 after they responded to a disturbance call at a bar where the men
had been drinking. Voto was beaten and shot in the head. Tedesco, who had
been forced to strip to his underwear, was shot in the stomach.</TE>
<TE>   Trantino surrendered the same night; his accomplice was shot to death
two days later by police trying to arrest him.</TE>

<HD>Alabama Gov. Says He's Innocent</HD>
<DH>Corruption: Donald Siegelman claims reports of a probe into his
finances is a Republican campaign maneuver.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONTGOMERY, Ala.
</DL>
<LD>Gov. Donald Siegelman proclaimed his innocence Monday amid reports
that criminal investigators have subpoenaed his banking and investment
records as part of a growing probe into state business deals.</LD>
<LD>   "I know I have done nothing wrong and those records will show that,"
Siegelman said.</LD>
<LD>   Siegelman said he learned about the subpoena from a report in the
Birmingham News on Sunday, and he accused someone within the
investigation of leaking information to damage his reputation in an
election year.</LD>
<TE>   Recent statewide polls showed the Democrat in a virtual dead heat with
the two leading Republican front-runners, Lt. Gov. Steve Windom and U.S.
Rep. Bob Riley.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear this is coming from a joint investigation by a Republican
attorney general and a Republican U.S. attorney. It's coming at the
beginning of what will be a tough, hard-fought campaign," Siegelman said.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama Atty. Gen. Bill Pryor and U.S. Atty. Leura Garrett Canary
declined comment.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal authorities have investigated several state deals,
including a now-defunct Alabama warehouse construction project supervised
by one of Siegelman's long-term supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Roland Vaughan, former chairman of the Business Council of Alabama,
was hired for $25,000 by a Siegelman aide to scout warehouse sites for
the state. He was indicted for theft after it was discovered he was
half-owner of the site he recommended Alabama buy, according to court
papers.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the News also disclosed that Siegelman failed to report
money from investments and legal fees on his financial disclosure
reports, some dating back to 1996. He filed amended reports with the
Alabama Ethics Commission after being questioned by the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the governor said the amount was less than $250,000.
The investment money came through Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach, one of the
companies from which investigators have sought Siegelman's financial
records. No one from the firm returned a telephone call Monday.</TE>

<HD>GOP Leaders Go Into Battle on Finance Bill Without Bush</HD>
<DH>Campaign: They push for the president to get more involved as
debate starts. Potential defectors are told passage could cost the party
the House.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>As the House battle on campaign finance reform legislation starts
today, frantic Republican leaders are warning their troops that the
future strength of the GOP is at risk if the bill passes.</LD>
<LD>   But a key party warrior has been missing from the battlefield:
President Bush, who has been keeping a low profile in the House's pivotal
debate on limiting special-interest contributions to politics.</LD>
<LD>   Bush is under pressure from House Republican leaders to change his
posture and help their effort to kill or cripple the bill. If Bush stays
on the sidelines, they warn, the bill is far more likely to pass, aided
by substantial defections from Republican ranks.</LD>
<TE>   But Bush has made no secret of his desire to steer clear of an issue
that has bedeviled him since it was central to his presidential primary
fight against Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a leading proponent of the bill
coming before the House.</TE>
<TE>   The reform issue confronts Bush at a particularly awkward time. Enron
Corp. and its executives have been major financial backers of his
political career, and the administration has labored to demonstrate that
its policies have not been affected by the energy company's influence.</TE>
<TE>   Bush spokeswoman Claire Buchan said Monday that White House aides may
work with GOP leaders on crafting amendments to the bill--changes that
reform backers contend are aimed at killing the measure. The president
however, has made no commitment to getting personally involved, Buchan
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's hands-off stance on campaign finance reform has generated some
tensions between the White House and House Republicans. Some lawmakers
believe they have taken significant political risks to carry his agenda
on trade, taxes and other issues through Congress, and now he is failing
to reciprocate on a matter crucial to them.</TE>
<TE>Lawmaker Questions Bush Aides on Issue</TE>
<TE>   At a recent closed-door party retreat, many Republicans were
infuriated when three top aides to Bush, including chief political
advisor Karl Rove, refused to give a straight answer to a blunt question
about whether the White House would help House leaders amend or defeat
the campaign finance bill.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't have an answer," said Rep. John T. Doolittle (R-Rocklin),
who posed the question. "This is something they would just as soon stay
away from, but they are going to have to be right in the middle of it."</TE>
<TE>   At issue is legislation, backed by most House Democrats and a cadre of
renegade Republicans, that would eliminate "soft money"--the unlimited,
loosely regulated contributions to national political parties by
corporations, unions and individuals. With the amount of such donations
now totaling hundreds of millions of dollars each election cycle,
reformers say soft money givers such as Enron are bound to exert unfair
clout on politicians.</TE>
<TE>   Versions of the bill, co-sponsored by Reps. Martin T. Meehan (D-Mass.)
and Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), passed the House twice in the late
1990s. But each time, the measure stalled in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   In April, after McCain had spotlighted the issue in his presidential
bid, a reform bill passed the Senate. During the debate on it, Bush said
he supported a ban on soft money contributions by unions and
corporations, but that the prohibition should not apply to individuals.
He also called for a requirement that unions get the consent of their
members before using dues for political contributions, a proposal
strongly opposed by labor leaders and most Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the House nor Senate bills reflect Bush's recommendations, but
so far he has not threatened to veto the bills.</TE>
<TE>   In Milwaukee, where Bush spoke Monday, deputy White House press
secretary Scott McClellan said of Bush's position: "The president has
made his principles very clear: He supports campaign finance reform,"
McClellan said. "If it improves the system, the president intends to sign
it."</TE>
<TE>   McCain, meanwhile, has remained a major player in the debate. He held
a news conference Monday with business executives who support the soft
money ban. Later, he met with House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt
(D-Mo.) to plot strategy. And he is phoning fence-sitting House members
to urge their support for the reform bill, including some Republicans he
campaigned for in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   GOP leaders have ratcheted up their rhetoric to stem defections.
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) told a closed-door meeting of
Republicans last week that the bill was a matter of "life and death" to
the GOP, saying its passage could cost the party control of the House. A
major GOP concern is that unions, acting on their own, still would be
able to mobilize get-out-the-vote efforts for Democrats. Republicans,
without soft money, could not match such efforts, the GOP leaders say.</TE>
<TE>   But some Republicans fear that without a veto threat from Bush, such
warnings and calls for party unity may lack teeth.</TE>
<TE>   "If [Bush] put up a fight, [that] might give pause to some undecided
swing votes," said a GOP political strategist who asked not to be named.
"But when you sit on your hands, the message you are sending is: This is
not a priority, so go vote however you want."</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the soft money ban are aiming to fend off amendments to
the House bill--which is similar but not identical to the Senate
version--and then send it directly to the Senate for final approval. That
would keep the matter from going to a conference committee to resolve
differences between the House and Senate bills, a procedure that
sometimes derails legislation.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, House Republican leaders are readying a series of
amendments to change the bill enough to force it to a conference
committee.</TE>
<TE>   One such amendment would require all political donors to be U.S.
citizens. Another fight could arise over whether the bill would take
effect 30 days after enactment or after the 2002 elections.</TE>
<TE>   McCain indicated Monday that he favors delaying the effective date
until after November's vote, which could increase support for the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The most contentious votes are not expected until Wednesday, but the
House is expected today to agree to ground rules, including which
amendments will be offered. GOP leaders remain hopeful that Bush will
throw his weight behind one or more of their proposed amendments.</TE>
<TE>   Although the GOP leaders are disappointed Bush has not gotten more
involved in the debate, few are surprised. They note Bush personally
would have few concerns about a soft money ban because, as his 2000
presidential campaign showed, he is a master at generating the smaller,
regulated donations that go directly to candidates. The Republican
leaders also appreciate that Bush is inclined to focus his political
resources on maintaining bipartisan support for his war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "He has bigger problems to deal with than this," said a House
Republican close to Bush. "If we can't solve it on our own, it's our own
problem."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts argue that the best thing Bush can do to help other
Republicans politically is to maintain his own sky-high popularity
ratings and guard against being tainted by the Enron controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "The president's glow is what's keeping Republicans in favor," said
Marshall Wittmann, a political analyst at the conservative Hudson
Institute. "That glow could be tarnished if he's viewed as highlighting
his political Achilles' heel: his link to big money."</TE>

<HD>Editor to Quit Job at Online Magazine Slate</HD>
<DH>Journalism: Michael Kinsley cites need for change, health reasons
in decision to leave.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE
</DL>
<LD>Michael Kinsley said Monday he is stepping down as the editor of
Slate, the pioneering and widely admired online magazine he founded with
the backing of Microsoft Corp. in 1996.</LD>
<LD>   In a memo to his staff, Kinsley said he felt "a need for change, and I
think Slate could use a change as well."</LD>
<LD>   Kinsley told Associated Press that he would continue to write for
Slate and hoped to work on other projects, such as promotional
opportunities with other media organizations.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not going to be spending my time sitting around," he said,
putting to rest any notion that he was retiring.</TE>
<TE>   Kinsley said the fact that he has Parkinson's disease was on his mind
when he made the decision to leave Slate.</TE>
<TE>   "On the one hand it would be nice to have a bit more time to exercise
and do other things I ought to do for my health," he said from his
Seattle-area home. "On the other hand, I was thinking if I do this
everyone will be thinking it's because of the Parkinson's. So that
actually was [causing] me to put it off."</TE>
<TE>   Kinsley surprised many in journalism circles in December with an
announcement that he had been diagnosed eight years ago with Parkinson's,
a progressive neurological disorder which causes muscle tremors and
affects more than 1 million Americans. It is incurable but not usually
fatal.</TE>
<TE>   In an essay for Time magazine, Kinsley said he had struggled with his
decision to keep the fact that he had Parkinson's to himself and defended
the notion of going on with his life as if he didn't have the disease.</TE>
<TE>   Kinsley is a former editor of the New Republic, a weekly commentary
magazine, and has also been a co-host of "Crossfire," a CNN political
talk show.</TE>
<TE>   One of the earliest online magazines to make a name for itself, Slate
has built a reputation for excellence and thoughtful commentary that
remains among the most respected on the Web.</TE>
<TE>   But Slate has yet to become profitable on its own.</TE>
<TE>   "To be blunt, we haven't yet accomplished my main goals here, which
were to establish the kind of publication that would become
self-sustaining," Kinsley said. "We're very close to proving that, but
we're not there yet, but I intend to be here to celebrate when we do."</TE>
<TE>   Slate's deputy editor, Jack Shafer, and political editor, Jacob
Weisberg, will oversee the magazine until Kinsley's successor is named.</TE>

<HD>Arizona 'Eco-Arsonist' Gets 18 Years in Prison</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX
</DL>
<LD>A man who said he wanted to save the desert from housing developers
was sentenced Monday to 18 years in prison for setting fire to a series
of luxury homes being built near protected mountain land.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Warren Sands of Phoenix, labeled an "eco-arsonist" by the press,
received two years shy of the maximum sentence that U.S. District Judge
Susan Bolton could have imposed because of a plea deal with prosecutors.
He also must pay $2.82 million for damage caused.</LD>
<LD>   A teary-eyed Sands, 50, apologized to his victims during the hearing
and said there was no excuse for his actions.</LD>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Joseph Welty said Sands' arson rampage was "a
reprehensible crime" designed to fuel his ego, not preserve the
environment.</TE>
<TE>   Sands pleaded guilty Nov. 7 to eight counts of extortion and one count
of using a fire to commit a felony. He had been indicted on 23 arson and
extortion counts.</TE>
<TE>   Sands admitted to setting eight fires in Phoenix and Scottsdale from
April 2000 to January 2001 in a supposed attempt to save protected areas.</TE>

<HD>Vandal Intended to Derail Train</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Transit officials said Monday that whoever wedged a concrete block
under a Northridge railroad track last week was trying to derail a
train.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, the Metrolink board posted a $10,000 reward for
information in the case.</LD>
<LD>   The damage to the track jarred a Metrolink train carrying 300
passengers from Oxnard to downtown Los Angeles on Thursday, officials
said. They said it was the worst act of vandalism in Metrolink's
10-year history.</LD>
<TE>   "This was such a serious threat," Metrolink spokeswoman Sharon
Gavin said.</TE>
<TE>   The jagged, 2-foot-long block of concrete had been jammed under
the track at the Nordhoff Street overpass. It lifted 20 feet of rail
2 inches, enough to derail a fast-moving train, Gavin said.</TE>
<TE>   The Metrolink train was traveling 70 mph when it bumped over the
elevated track. For several hours afterward, trains slowed to 5 mph
through the area, Gavin said. The rail was fixed later Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, a conviction for attempting to derail a train
carries a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility
of parole. If a derailment kills another person, the offense can
carry the death penalty.</TE>

Angeles County Sheriff's Department at (909) 392-8413.</TE>

<HD>County Strawberry Harvest Is Ripe for a Record Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County's strawberry harvest is shifting into high gear, as
clear skies and mild temperatures boost production and put growers on
pace toward what could be a record season.</LD>
<LD>   Although a recent cold snap put the brakes on the early season
harvest--statewide production stood at 1.6 million trays through
Friday, compared with 2.2 million during the same period last
year--there are plenty of berries on the way.</LD>
<LD>   "The cold weather slowed us down a little bit, but it's a long
season," said Oxnard strawberry grower David Murray, who oversees
about 300 acres for Coastal Berry Co. "Our fields look better than
ever, and I think consumers can expect to see high-quality fruit."</LD>
<TE>   Most production this time of the year takes place in the southern
part of the state, especially in Ventura County. Growers here have
continued to plant record acreage with strawberries, now the county's
second most valuable cash crop, after lemons, according to the
county's agricultural commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   Strawberry growers on the Oxnard plain have 8,582 acres in
production this year, a 10% increase over last year and double the
acreage dedicated to strawberry production a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Growers statewide are working 27,178 acres this year, an 8%
increase over last year and the most in state history, according to
the California Strawberry Commission. Spokeswoman Dominique Hansen
said a longer growing season and extended periods of good weather
could combine for a record production year.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get some good weather going, we could really be looking at
some high-volume numbers," Hansen said. "From what I understand the
quality has been really good, the fruit tastes great, and it looks
great."</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say there haven't been problems.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to minor damage inflicted by last month's frigid
temperatures, growers are entering the second year of reduced use of
the controversial soil fumigant methyl bromide.</TE>
<TE>   Championed as a potent pest killer, the colorless, odorless gas
had been used on more than 90% of California's commercial strawberry
acreage until 2000, when it started to be phased out under terms of
an international treaty.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists and others have long fought to ban use of the
fumigant, saying it is potentially harmful to children, farm workers
and people who live near fields where it is applied. It is scheduled
to be banned altogether by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California strawberry growers also wrestled this season
with rampant root rot that caused scores of plants to wither and die.
Some farmers were forced to replant as much as one-quarter of their
acreage because of the disease, according to a Ventura County
agricultural official.</TE>
<TE>   Many local growers say they fear low prices for their harvests, as
increased acreage and higher yields create an oversupply and
depressed markets.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last decade, no other area of the state has planted more
new strawberry acreage than Ventura County, which remains
California's second-largest strawberry producing region behind
Watsonville/Salinas, according to the strawberry commission.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the value of the crop has been dropping. The county's
strawberry crop generated $186 million in sales in 2000, $34 million
less than the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   "All it produces for the most part is a losing market for all of
us," said veteran Camarillo grower Michael Conroy, who farms about
100 acres.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at all these people [planting strawberries] and you
wonder, 'What do they know that we don't know?'" he added. "Those
that can't keep pace are going to fall by the wayside. For small
people like myself, you hope you can find a niche in the market and
keep it going year after year."</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard grower Kaz Iwamoto has done just that. By growing
pesticide-free berries and selling directly to customers at farmers'
markets, Iwamoto said he's been able to build a following with his
Harry's Berries brand.</TE>
<TE>   Organic berries now represent about 1.5% of the plantings
statewide.</TE>
<TE>   "We set our prices usually quite a bit higher than anybody else in
the market, and the people who buy from us don't even blink," said
Iwamoto, who is just getting going on a harvest that will peak this
spring. "Our customers know us, and we've established trust with our
brand."</TE>

<DL>ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST</DL>
<LD>Authorities on Monday identified two teenagers killed when a car
plunged into Lake Hughes over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Clifford Johnson, 19, of the Lake Hughes area and Timothy William
Grimsley, 15, of Green Valley died when their car went over the side
of Lake Elizabeth Road on Saturday night, California Highway Patrol
Officer Rusty Moore said.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles County coroner's office is conducting an autopsy,
but preliminary evidence suggests the two drowned, Moore said.</LD>
<TE>   The driver, 20-year-old Caleb Burge, was taken by helicopter to
Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, where the CHP said he was in
serious condition. Blood tests show Burge was not intoxicated, Moore
said.</TE>
<TE>   Burge was wearing a seat belt but the two passengers were not,
according to the CHP.</TE>
<TE>   Grimsley's mother, Martine Kurs, said her son had moved from her
home in Lake Hughes to his father's home in nearby Green Valley about
a month ago.</TE>

<HD>New Map Includes Both Candidates</HD>
<DH>Elections: Plan would keep Cardenas, Greuel in redrawn 2nd
District.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of San Fernando Valley residents Monday urged a commission to
redraw the 2nd City Council District in a way that will keep
candidates Wendy Greuel and Tony Cardenas in the same district.</LD>
<LD>   Residents complained that they might find, when the new districts
take effect, that whichever candidate they choose in the March 5
election no longer represents them.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Redistricting Commission had proposed boundaries
that would have split the 2nd District, putting Greuel's Van Nuys
home in one district and Cardenas' Panorama City residence in the
other.</LD>
<TE>   Armed with more than 100 signatures, Lloyd Hitt and other
residents of Sunland-Tujunga called that proposal unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "We asked you to stop interfering in elections. We find that
you're asking us to choose between the elected representative of our
choice and the district of our choice," Hitt said.</TE>
<TE>   But Commission Chairman John Emerson unveiled a plan Monday that
would include Greuel and Cardenas in the same redrawn district, which
would stretch from Sunland-Tujunga to Van Nuys. That should prevent
the redistricting plan from becoming an issue in the March 5 council
election, Emerson said.</TE>
<TE>   "For those of you worried about having two candidates in separate
districts, stop worrying. It's not an issue," Emerson said at a
public hearing at Parkman Middle School in Woodland Hills on Monday
attended by more than 300 people. However, Alan Clayton of the Latino
Redistricting Coalition said it appears that Emerson's alternative
would dilute Latino voting strength in a new district. If that
happens, Clayton said, he will file a voting rights complaint with
the U.S. Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Emerson said an alternative proposal by Clayton that would keep
the two candidates in one district and maintain Latino voting
strength also will be considered by the commission.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever wins the March 5 runoff election will, for about five
months, represent the current 2nd District. The new lines will take
effect Aug. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Territory removed from the 2nd District would become part of a
district represented either by Councilwoman Ruth Galanter or
Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski. Their districts are being merged
along the coast to allow for the creation of a district in the
Valley. If the council approves the plan, the Valley will have five
districts.</TE>
<TE>   In her campaign, Greuel has told Sunland-Tujunga residents not to
waste their votes on Cardenas, because he would not live in the 2nd
District after the remapping.</TE>
<TE>   That concerned Emerson and other commissioners. Emerson said
keeping both candidates in the same district would "remove the draft
map from being an issue in the political campaigns." The council
today will ask its staff to consider extending by two weeks the
commission's March 1 deadline for redrawing the districts. That would
allow the commission to set the 2nd District aside until after the
election, Councilman Tom LaBonge said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Sunland-Tujunga residents complained that their
district was gerrymandered in the commission's original plan to
combine it with Encino in the West Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Emerson's alternative would swap much of Van Nuys for
Sunland-Tujunga in the district that includes Encino.</TE>

<DH>Politics: Residents of tiny Hidden Valley say they're
unhappy with county services. Critics say developer Murdock has a
hidden agenda.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Residents of an upscale horse community in eastern Ventura County
have been quietly exploring the possibility of forming a new
city--but have shelved plans pending the outcome of a supervisor's
race in the March 5 election.</LD>
<LD>   If successful, Hidden Valley would become the county's 11th city.
Its wealthy residents would gain greater control over everything from
how often roads are paved to how many homes will sprout from its
rolling, green hills.</LD>
<LD>   But the push is already fraught with obstacles and tinged by the
bitter growth politics that have defined the surrounding Conejo
Valley for more than a decade.</LD>
<TE>   Hidden Valley residents say they are motivated by a desire for
better municipal services and control over building decisions. But
critics suggest that the area's largest landholder, developer David
H. Murdock, is behind the push for cityhood so he can subdivide his
land into pricey new homes.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock owns 1,540 acres in Hidden Valley, including his 10-acre
Arabian horse ranch, county records show. At a recent meeting where
Hidden Valley property owners discussed incorporation, Murdock
reportedly asked his neighbors to hold off until after the March
primary.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock also urged the homeowners to vote for Randy Hoffman,
saying he would better represent their interests on the county Board
of Supervisors than his opponent, Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Linda
Parks, said Everett Millais, executive director of the Local Agency
Formation Commission. Hoffman and Parks are vying for the Thousand
Oaks-based seat being vacated by retiring Supervisor Frank Schillo.</TE>
<TE>   "He said it's important to get Randy Hoffman elected as supervisor
and have someone who pays more attention to [Hidden Valley]," said
Millais, who attended the Feb. 2 meeting at the request of the
homeowners. LAFCO would review any proposal for cityhood before it
goes to a ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' slow-growth supporters have seized on that statement as
evidence that Murdock is backing Hoffman because he wants to usher
through new residential housing. Murdock has contributed $91,000 to
Hoffman's campaign, making him the entrepreneur's biggest backer.</TE>
<TE>   Critics charge that Hoffman will help Murdock push through
cityhood for the area if he is elected supervisor. Supervisors are
allowed to appoint a representative to LAFCO, which is influential in
determining whether new cities are approved.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock May Benefit</TE>
<TE>   From Incorporation</TE>
<TE>   "A Hidden Valley city would benefit David Murdock tremendously,"
said Mary Weisbrock, president of the slow-growth organization Save
Open Space. "If they become a city, those acres will not be under the
county's growth-control laws. And a beautiful, bucolic valley will be
destroyed with urbanization."</TE>
<TE>   Murdock could not be reached for comment. But Rick Principe,
president of the Hidden Valley Homeowners Assn., said Murdock did not
spearhead the drive for cityhood.</TE>
<TE>   Under current zoning, Murdock could build up to 75 homes.
Weisbrock said she has no objection to that. But she worries that the
number would increase if the land is taken out of county control.</TE>
<TE>   Principe said he began exploring the idea of incorporation last
year as a way to solve grievances with county government. Residents
of the rolling horse country believe the county has ignored their
requests to resurface Potrero Road, a two-lane country road that
bisects the community, Principe said.</TE>
<TE>   And a recent proposal to create a greenbelt for the area, which
would place new restrictions on what can be built, has neighbors
alarmed, Principe said. Neighbors want to preserve the area's rustic
feel, but don't want another layer of bureaucracy imposed on them, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "That would place new restrictions on things like building a barn
or a riding ring," Principe said. "We don't need another bureaucratic
department to review everything we do."</TE>
<TE>   Schillo backed off from the proposal after the homeowners group
said it would not support a greenbelt, Principe said. But many think
the idea will be resurrected if Parks, a slow-growth advocate, is
elected, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Roadblocks in the way of incorporation may end up scuttling the
process anyway. How to pay for administering a city, staffing a city
council and providing services is a key question mark.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest obstacle is a requirement that a new city have at
least 500 registered voters. The county's elections division said
Hidden Valley has about 126 registered voters. The neighboring Lake
Sherwood community has 865 registered voters, but Principe said it is
unlikely that Hidden Valley residents would support joining forces.</TE>
<TE>   "People in Hidden Valley do not want to give up control to
anyone," he said. "To go from giving control to the county to giving
control to Lake Sherwood, they are not gaining anything."</TE>
<TE>   Residents Will Wait Until Election to Decide</TE>
<TE>   Still, residents will hold off until the March election to make a
final decision, Principe continued.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite honestly, what we would like to see is a Board of
Supervisors that will listen to us," he said. "If we have that, we
wouldn't have to push for anything."</TE>
<TE>   Schillo acknowledged that Potrero Road has not been resurfaced for
at least a decade. But other county roads are in the same condition
because of a lack of road funds, he said. The supervisor warned
residents to study the idea of cityhood very carefully before making
a decision.</TE>
<TE>   "If they want to be a city, fine," he said. "But they will have to
pay for it, and that will be pretty expensive."</TE>

<HD>Accountant Sentenced for Robbing Charities</HD>
<DH>Courts: Paul Peachey of Oxnard gets nine years in prison
for embezzling $1 million from groups aiding the disabled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Oxnard accountant has been sentenced to nine years in state
prison for embezzling more than $1 million from two charities that
raise money for mentally disabled residents.</LD>
<LD>   Paul E. Peachey, 61, owned a company that for 18 years provided
accounting services for thrift stores run by the Foundation for
Retarded Citizens of Ventura County and the Santa Maria Assn. for the
Retarded Foundation.</LD>
<LD>   His responsibilities for the charities included bookkeeping,
payroll management and issuing checks, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   From January 1997 to November 2000, authorities say, the owner of
Peachey Accounting Service altered checks made out to him or his
company and used some of the money to build a 5,400-square-foot home
on 20 acres in Tulare County.</TE>
<TE>   Peachey, who was arrested after one of the charities noticed a
problem in its books, initially denied the charges. But he later
pleaded guilty to three counts of felony grand theft and one count of
income tax perjury, admitting that he signed false tax returns.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Ventura County Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark
ordered Peachey to pay $880,000 in restitution to the Foundation for
Retarded Citizens of Ventura County. The charity discovered losses
that exceeded $800,000.</TE>
<TE>   Peachey was also ordered to pay $277,589 to the Santa Maria
association and $21,441 to the state Franchise Tax Board.</TE>
<TE>   To recoup losses, the Foundation for Retarded Citizens reached a
civil settlement in which the Tulare County house and other assets
were turned over to the group.</TE>

<HD>New Plea Sought in Infant's Death</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Father who admitted to killing his 10-week-old by
shaking him has a new attorney and now wants a trial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Simi Valley father who pleaded guilty last month to second-degree
murder for shaking his infant son to death is now attempting to
withdraw the plea.</LD>
<LD>   Brian Trelatsky, 26, appeared in Ventura County Superior Court on
Monday for a sentencing hearing, accompanied by a new defense
attorney. But he asked instead to reverse his plea. He did not give a
reason.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Ken Riley postponed sentencing and gave Trelatsky three
weeks to put his request in writing.</LD>
<TE>   Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona said she will oppose a change
of plea, saying Trelatsky knew what he was doing when he pleaded
guilty.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no basis for the plea withdrawal in this case," Corona
said after the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Marina del Rey attorney E.J. Montanez, who took over Trelatsky's
defense from a public defender, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Corona said the defense must show that the plea was made under
duress or demonstrate that Trelatsky didn't understand what he was
doing. That will be tough to prove, she said, because Trelatsky
agreed in writing that there was a factual basis for the plea and
that he was not coerced.</TE>
<TE>   Trelatsky faces a mandatory sentence of 15 years to life in prison
for killing his 10-week-old son, Tyler.</TE>
<TE>   A stay-at-home father, Trelatsky was the primary caregiver for the
infant and an older son, Scottie, now 3.</TE>
<TE>   On March 28, 2000, firefighters and police responded to a 911 call
of a baby not breathing and found Tyler in cardiac arrest at the
family's mobile home.</TE>
<TE>   Tyler was taken to Simi Valley Hospital for initial treatment,
then transferred to the pediatric intensive-care unit at Northridge
Hospital Medical Center, where doctors determined that he had
symptoms consistent with shaken-baby syndrome. The child died the
next day.</TE>
<TE>   Trelatsky was arrested six months later and charged with child
abuse causing death, which carries a prison sentence of 25 years to
life.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors reduced the charge to second-degree murder after
Trelatsky offered to plead guilty to the lesser charge, Corona said.</TE>
<TE>   She said Monday that she will try to prosecute Trelatsky on the
original abuse charges if the guilty plea is withdrawn and the case
goes to trial.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing on the plea issue is set for March 12.</TE>
<TE>   Trelatsky remains in jail in lieu of $278,500 bail.</TE>
