<LD>I heard from my old friend Abdul the other day and he said, "Beware."</LD>
<LD>   As you might imagine, this shook me up considerably, considering
the current climate of caution in America, until he explained that
his reference was to the "Star Wars" movie and not to a terrorist
attack.</LD>
<LD>   He was warning me that it was a lousy movie and I shouldn't waste
my time seeing it. "See 'Spider-Man' instead," he said, in the kind
of conspiratorial tone he loves.</LD>
<TE>   I guess I'm a little edgy these days. We've had so many warnings
about impending terrorist attacks that even visiting my barber
requires a certain amount of courage.</TE>
<TE>   When I told Abdul of my concern, he hesitated a moment and then
said, "Well, I do have some serious information."</TE>
<TE>   He's kind of a character, and I was tempted to ignore him, but
then he came up with a source as good as those who feed information
to the FBI, the CIA, the National Security Council, the Department of
Defense and the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul had heard from his mother in New Haven who had heard from
her cousin in Detroit who had heard from a sister in Tacoma who had
heard from a niece in East Timor that certain Arab owners of
convenience stores, gas stations and liquor stores who are secret
members of Al Qaeda will rise up as one sometime this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Good Lord," I said, "you mean there's going to be an all-out
attack?"</TE>
<TE>   "Worse," he said, shaking his head. "They're going to all shut
down at once."</TE>
<TE>   I'll admit that the impact of the warning didn't strike me at
first, even though it came from a reliable source. Well, sources. But
when one considers how many convenience stores, gas stations and
liquor stores are run by Arabs, this could cause chaos if they
simultaneously shut down.</TE>
<TE>   We have seen many instances of rage in L.A. centered around cars,
including road rage, lane rage and parking space rage. Suppose we
were suddenly cut off from an easy source of gasoline. Would fuel
rage follow? I shudder to think.</TE>
<TE>   Even worse might be beer rage. If those guys in backward-facing
Dodger caps and packs of cigarettes tucked into the rolled-up sleeves
of their T-shirts can't get their six-packs right away, God knows how
they might express their unhappiness.</TE>
<TE>   Hard liquor rage, while possibly more modified, could, in
conjunction with the other rages, result in the kind of calamity that
paralyzes commerce and shuts down the economy. I saw a friend go into
a martini rage once when they mistakenly poured sweet vermouth
instead of dry vermouth into his gin, and it wasn't a pretty sight.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to alarm anyone," Abdul said, "but I'm thinking we
should go to a pink alert status."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we have a pink alert," I said. "We have green,
yellow and red. I'm not even sure about the green."</TE>
<TE>   Abdul leaned in closer. "Oh, there's a pink all right," he said.
"The FBI just hasn't made it public yet. It goes from yellow to pink
and then to red. The pink means they're just outside the door. I
heard it from my sister who heard it from a bartender in Washington,
D.C.!"</TE>
<TE>   I am inclined to dismiss Abdul's warning. Yes, his source/s are up
to the level of Abu Zubeida, that so-called senior Al Qaeda commander
we're holding, but I'm not too sure about him, either. He warned us
that terrorists were going to strike our banks, and then he warned us
they were going to strike our malls, and nothing's happened.</TE>
<TE>   Causing problems at banks doesn't concern me, since banks are so
arrogant, but screw up a mall and all those teenage girls who are
deprived of hanging out could begin displaying symptoms of mall
withdrawal, resulting in untypical bouts of screaming, crying and
refusing to clean their rooms.</TE>
<TE>   I was in something of a dilemma. Abdul's mother in New Haven and
her cousin in Detroit and her cousin's sister in Tacoma and her niece
in East Timor could have been spreading what the FBI likes to call
disinformation. Meaning lies. Another weapon of terrorism is to see
us running around in all directions like so many Keystone Kops,
dashing in and out of doors and bumping into each other until we drop
exhausted and the terrorists walk in and take over.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, if I don't warn America as Abdul suggested, and
all the convenience stores, liquor stores and gas stations actually
do shut down, the damage could be devastating. Even worse, I'll be
nagged to death by Congress, talk show hosts, political pundits and
people like me with no expertise in anything wanting to know what I
knew and when I knew it.</TE>
<TE>   So I'm not going to do anything but suggest that you keep some
extra gasoline on hand and stash away several cases of beer. Do it
secretly, because they're watching us closely. I get that straight
from my sister in Oakland who got it from a woman at a nail salon who
heard if from the wife of a pool boy who got it from a friend in the
cleaning business who heard it ...</TE>

<LD>Jeff Krulik has modest plans for his 15-minute guerrilla documentary
"Heavy Metal Parking Lot." He wants to produce a DVD. Oh, and a
feature-length movie, a Broadway musical, a TV show, a Saturday
morning cartoon, a line of clothes and maybe even skateboards.</LD>
<LD>   "I have no qualms about turning this into a product," he said,
nursing his jet lag with a margarita at a Mexican restaurant on
Sunset Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   Krulik had just flown in from Washington, D.C., to promote the
1986 movie he created with John Heyn, which is getting theatrical
release alongside the full-length documentary "Home Movie." Both open
Friday at the Nuart.</LD>
<TE>   "Parking Lot" stars a group of Spandex-clad Judas Priest fans,
hanging out at the Capital Center arena in Largo, Md., before a
concert. It was, until now, circulated only through bootleg copies
and word of mouth, becoming a cult classic, with fans including Sofia
Coppola, Spike Jonze, Ed Norton and David Grohl of the Foo Fighters.</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, we didn't have any particular vision beyond showing it
to our friends," Krulik said. "Now, years later, it has an
anthropological feel. People have written term papers on it." He
added, "It's sort of a 'Nanook of the North,' an ancient,
entertaining culture."</TE>
<TE>   He attributes the underground success of the movie to its stars.</TE>
<TE>   "They were so animated, inebriated and willing to go on camera,"
Krulik said. "As soon as you took the camera out, you had your
material ....We happened to hit pay dirt."</TE>
<TE>   And the two filmmakers, who conceived of the project "as a lark,"
found and documented a moment in popular culture.</TE>
<TE>   "If you grew up in the '80s, you either were at that concert or
you were there through osmosis," Krulik said. "It was a rite of
passage."</TE>
<TE>   After "Heavy Metal Parking Lot," Krulik did a "Neil Diamond
Parking Lot" and a "Harry Potter Parking Lot." Fans of the genre have
sent their tributes, including "Girl Power Parking Lot."</TE>
<TE>   Krulik, who found that his offbeat sensibility made him able to
anticipate the next pop culture phenomenon, paused as he pondered
what we should look for next.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe Barry Manilow?"</TE>
<TE>   The Standard Crowd</TE>
<TE>   A mob of restless partygoers shoved past burly security guards
into the event of the night, a loud, flashy affair to celebrate a
video game and a hotel opening. Their glittery presence on the vacant
streets of downtown Los Angeles, just a few blocks west of Skid Row,
seemed incongruous. The crowd of narrow girls in blousy summer attire
and famous people dressed to blend in left Flower Street and made its
way into the party that was held in and around the new Standard
Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Skyscrapers provided a glamorous backdrop to the outdoor portion
of the event. A projected version of the PlayStation 2 logo danced on
the buildings. (The video game company hosted the party and rented
the hotel for the week. The Standard doesn't open to the public until
Monday.) At one end of the transformed parking lot, Jane's Addiction
performed the Rolling Stones' tune "Sympathy for the Devil," putting
its unique spin on the song. Perry Farrell, who bore a startling
resemblance to John Travolta a la "Saturday Night Fever," held a
martini in one hand and the microphone in the other.</TE>
<TE>   People gravitated toward the elevated, rotating bar for
complimentary cocktails. Not everyone was impressed with the
mechanics. "I went a full circle before I got a drink," one man said.
In the crowd, David Arquette and Courteney Cox Arquette mingled,
occasionally signing autographs. Tobey Maguire was there chatting up
a woman, but there will be no photographic record of his or Drew
Barrymore's attendance. Both actors prohibited pictures.</TE>
<TE>   At the hotel, guards kept a crowd at bay. Those refused entry
peered in the window at the privileged guests sitting on pink
couches. "They're not letting in the Philistines," an onlooker said.
"Colored drinks" weren't allowed inside, either. In the lobby, a
waitress tried to explain this policy to Hugh Hefner and his five
girlfriends. "The fabric," she explained. "Even cranberry juice will
mess it up." Hefner guffawed and ordered a vodka tonic. A bald man
wearing blue eye shadow and false eyelashes walked around the lobby
carrying a riding crop. He stopped in front of the escalator,
shimmied, then looked over his shoulder and shouted: "Swizzle stick
on the couch!" No one flinched.</TE>
<TE>   After midnight everyone wanted to go to the roof. It was the
party's VIP lounge, of course, where the mood oozed with exclusivity.
People lounged on the trio of waterbeds that are part of the roof's
decor. Others warmed themselves by a brick fireplace, idled near the
bar or hovered around the steamy pool. Meanwhile, downstairs, people
clamored to get into the hotel with an urgency usually reserved for
natural disasters, prompting one woman to comment: "I guess this is
the only party in town tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "I stayed with Camryn Manheim when I was a prospective student.
She was tired of putting up prospectives, but when she was asked to
do it again, she said, 'Let me see pictures.' She looked at head
shots and pointed to me and said, 'I'll take him.'"</TE>

<LD>THE TRANSLATOR</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By John Crowley</LD>
<TE>   William Morrow</TE>
<TE>   298 pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   John Crowley is the award-winning and much-admired author of seven
previous novels, vast in conception and hard to classify. Though he
is generally considered a fantasist, Crowley's fantasy is of a sort
that seems to lurk just under the surface of our own world, like a
mirror urgently reflecting our image back at us with increased
intensity and subtly altered perspectives.</TE>
<TE>   "The Translator" is in many ways a surprising departure, a Cold
War drama whose emotional and political realism is conveyed with
unexpected delicacy and nuance. By the end, the novel blooms into a
container for the largest questions, as it weighs the meaning of
individual lives against the fate of empires.</TE>
<TE>   The translator of the title is Kit Malone. It is February 1961,
and she is one of a group of high school poets being feted at the
White House. She shakes President Kennedy's hand and hears for the
first time the name of Innokenti Falin, a recently exiled Russian
poet now teaching in the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   From this point we move forward and backward in time, caught up in
three separate strands of Kit's life: emblematic scenes from her
childhood, her college career and involvement with Falin, and a
present-day conference in Russia devoted to the work of the
long-vanished poet, much of which survives only in Kit's
translations.</TE>
<TE>   Kit's father's job setting up "a network of electronic brains"
means frequent childhood moves, so she grows especially close to her
older brother, Ben. When she needs to assemble an insect collection
for school, he helps her overcome her reluctance. Later she will
write a poem about growing closer to nature "by means of the one
thing nature doesn't possess of itself, its names."</TE>
<TE>   Ben, in a burst of patriotism, enlists in the Army and joins the
Special Forces. Kit's response to this abandonment of their shared
world is a reckless pregnancy, which she spends in a convent; the
infant dies at birth. She also gives up poetry, or so she thinks.</TE>
<TE>   Kit's tentative first days on a Midwestern campus in the early
1960s are evocatively portrayed. Her fortuitous enrollment in Falin's
advanced poetry class, heady discussions of verse, their hesitant
involvement with one another for differing reasons they only
gradually come to understand--all this is rendered with aquarelle
freshness. The Manichean political atmosphere of the Cold War adds
palpable shadows to the edges of the picture.</TE>
<TE>   A second tragedy befalls Kit when news of Ben's death arrives. Her
private griefs allow her to grow closer to Falin's more worldly life
of loss and exile, though much about him remains mysterious. Kit
becomes friendly with a melange of student radicals, which places her
relationship with Falin in a larger, unsettling political
perspective. She is questioned by a government agent. This paranoid
milieu eventually provokes her doubts about the true circumstances of
her brother's death.</TE>
<TE>   The book's central thread, the erotic relationship between teacher
and student, unfolds through an accretion of unexpected details (such
as the fact that Falin owns a sports car, but Kit must teach him how
to drive it properly). Though she knows no Russian, Falin asks Kit to
help him translate his poetry, which--like the poet himself--can now
only live a shadow life in the exile of another language. The
progress of their linguistic intimacy--the poems and fragments of
poems, the Russian's American diction, Kit's naive assurance, the
human yearnings for which translation is only a metaphor--is
thoroughly convincing. Kit is simultaneously propelled back into
poetry and forward into feeling and the understated sexual denouement
is all the more powerful.</TE>
<TE>   Crowley's control of these interwoven strands is impressive. Each
layer of time feels like a renewed present, and the jumps between
them are never disruptive or coercive.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Falin's own political position grows murkier (is he some
sort of agent for the U.S.? For Russia?) he elaborates a Gnostic
vision drawn from the actual Russian philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev:
The soul of each nation is overseen by two angels, a greater and a
lesser, and they can be corrupted or in conflict with one another. Is
this a political parable? Strategic obfuscation? Or a real
explanation? Falin tells Kit he must go away. His wrecked car is
found, but no body.</TE>
<TE>   Just as the various time-threads in the novel are kept open
through its structure, so the book honors its mysteries. The fates of
nations and of individual lives continue to hang in the balance as
"The Translator" resonates long after the last page is turned.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Bushra Jawabri, now 20, a Palestinian refugee from the West
Bank, arrived in Maine for a summer camp session at Seeds of Peace,
she was terrified at the thought of sleeping in a cabin with her
sworn enemy.</LD>
<LD>   "I remember at the opening ceremony I was afraid to introduce
myself because that person might be Israeli, and the picture I had of
them were of soldiers who wanted to kill us," recalls Jawabri of the
visit in 1995 at the camp in rural Otisfield, about 30 miles
northwest of Portland. Since 1993, the camp has hosted teens from
conflict-ridden regions around the world. Despite her fears, Jawabri
slept in a bunk with 10 other girls--half of them Israeli, the other
half Palestinian--and, to her relief, "woke up the following morning
with the Israeli girls and nothing had happened. Nothing had happened
to me; nothing had happened to them." Now a junior at Manhattanville
College in New York, Jawabri said it was a big revelation.</LD>
<LD>   Such moments are daily occurrences at Seeds of Peace, which was
founded--by former journalist John Wallach, who had covered the
Middle East--with a group of 40 Israeli, Palestinian and Egyptian
teenagers who came to the camp for its first two-week session. This
summer, Seeds of Peace will host about 450 children and 75 adults
from 22 countries, including this year, for the first time,
Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   Although the program began by focusing on the Middle East, it has
greatly expanded its scope over the last two years. "Our signature
program was the Middle East. Because that model was so impressive, we
started to get approached by other people," said Dena Fisher,
executive director of the program, which has a staff of 25 with
offices in New York, Washington, D.C., and Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   "Cyprus was the first non-Middle Eastern country to come, in 1998,
and the Balkans were added in 2000," Fisher said recently from her
office in New York. Other participating countries, including India
and Pakistan, were added only last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We could expand a million-fold, it's just a question of
resources," Fisher said, citing Ireland as a country they would like
to bring into the program.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from a small group of U.S. campers, the children come from
war-torn countries where they have been taught to distrust outside
cultures. The tactic is to pair them with other kids whom they would
otherwise see as enemies.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve Afghan teenagers--six girls and six boys, ages 13 to
15--will come to the camp this summer and will be expected to
interact with Indian, Pakistani and American campers.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is suggesting that youth exchange is going to end a war or
conflict," said Susan Crais Hovanec of the South Asian Bureau of the
U.S. State Department from her office in Washington, D.C. The hope
is, however, that the participation of the Afghan children might make
them less vulnerable to being recruited into terrorist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "Children born of despair and violence and intolerance are
nurtured to hate and be distrustful and are highly susceptible to
terrorist propaganda. But children who are enabled to experience
cross-cultural encounters themselves and form their own opinions and
beliefs become seeds of peace," said Hovanec.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan government was quick to jump at the chance to
participate this year, said Homeyra Mokhtarzada of the Afghan Embassy
in Washington, despite the fact that when Seeds of Peace officials
first made overtures in January, the newly formed Afghan government
was barely a month old.</TE>
<TE>   "When we told Kabul [about the opportunity to participate], the
ministry didn't have phone systems or even electricity," Mokhtarzada
said. "The fact that they worked so hard to get these kids to Seeds
of Peace speaks to how important the program was to the government.
There are so many other priorities, but when this program came along,
the minister of education, Rasool Amin, himself made it a priority to
participate."</TE>
<TE>   There was some concern, however, that it would be difficult to
find Afghan children fluent in English, a requirement of the camp. As
it turned out, more than 350 qualified teens applied for the 12
slots.</TE>
<TE>   One reason the Afghan government was so eager to participate was
to have Afghan voices represented in international dialogue,
especially the voices of children, Mokhtarzada said. "I thought it
would be a great experience not only for the kids from Afghanistan,
but for the American children to learn about young Afghan kids'
dreams and aspirations, what they face day to day and what they've
lived through. These are kids who were there in the very worst of
times under the Taliban and were not lucky enough to leave. By
participating in Seeds of Peace, we are giving a voice to a group
from Afghanistan who haven't been heard from."</TE>
<TE>   Campers Are</TE>
<TE>   Government Appointees</TE>
<TE>   Kids who attend the camp sessions are selected by their own
governments. The only exceptions are the Americans, who hear about
the camp through word of mouth and apply for a small number of slots
through the Seeds of Peace office in New York. The Americans, who pay
$3,500 to participate in a 31/2-week session, must demonstrate
leadership skills, be articulate and have an interest in the
cross-cultural experience the camp provides. This summer, 58 U.S.
kids--chosen from a pool of 500 applicants--will attend. None of them
are from California.</TE>
<TE>   It costs about $2,500 to host each foreign camper for the session,
of which there are three this summer. Participants from other
countries are usually chosen by the departments of education of their
respective countries, and all costs are covered by the camp.</TE>
<TE>   The camp's operating budget is expected to exceed $1 million this
year, and although the program has received about $300,000 in funding
from the U.S. State Department over the last two years, most of its
operating costs are covered by private charitable donations, among
them contributions from the Annenberg Foundation, UBS Warburg
Foundation, Novartis and Lockheed Martin.</TE>
<TE>   In part because of the English-fluency requirement, for the first
few years of any country's participation, the teens often come from
the upper echelons of society. But, Wallach said, as a country
continues to participate and the number of campers increases, the
demographic mix tends to even out. Such has been the case with the
Israeli and Palestinian participants. The Israelis sort through
thousands of applications each summer, and the Palestinian Authority
through hundreds.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian Authority did not send a delegation of campers
last summer because of the current crisis in the Middle East,
although some Palestinians whose homes are in countries other than
Israel did participate, among them Jordan. In the past, as many as
70% of the children sent by the Palestinian Authority have come from
refugee camps. It still remains uncertain whether the Palestinian
Authority will send a delegation this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Wallach said that "when the government chooses the kids, you are
likely to gets kids who reflect that government's point of view." The
people who attend Seeds of Peace are not always "the ones who want to
make peace," he said, and the challenging work they do at camp
becomes all the more relevant.</TE>
<TE>   The non-U.S. campers come accompanied by a delegation of adult
educators and government officials, all selected by their respective
countries' departments of education. These adults participate in
their own program, arranged so they will not have undue influence
over the children they accompany. The "escorts," as they are
officially called, have their own coexistence sessions, and their
chief interaction with the kids during the summer comes when they
present the children with an inclusive history of their region that
they are required to form during the adult sessions.</TE>
<TE>   This Isn't 'Some</TE>
<TE>   Pie-in-the-Sky Scenario'</TE>
<TE>   So how do these potential seeds of peace get planted? Don't assume
these kids simply gather in the woods to share their mutual
understanding, warned Wallach. "There are no illusions about some
pie-in-the-sky scenario," he said. The kids undergo an evolution,
which is far from easy, Wallach said. At the beginning, "each side
views themselves as the victim, and the other side as the aggressor."</TE>
<TE>   "The first week they come, they are either completely idealistic
or determined to prove that their point of view is the only right
one," Wallach said. In the second week, they begin to "understand
that the version of history they have been taught may not be the only
reality there is," but they also come to realize there are very real
reasons hate exists between the two sides. "The third week, they
realize they have to deal with that hatred and still need to accept
each other anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Groups of 10 teenagers sit down with a professional facilitator to
confront the difficult, sometimes seemingly impossible, questions
that divide them. Benji Weiman-Kelman, 18, an Israeli from Jerusalem
who attended the camp in 2000, said it was most difficult for him
when the Palestinians in his group "were asked to condemn suicide
bombings and they wouldn't." At the same time, it also made him think
of his upcoming compulsory military duty, beginning next year, in a
new way: "It turned the other side into specific faces, my friends."</TE>
<TE>   Liz Carlin, a 17-year-old New Yorker who attended the camp, last
summer, sees the coexistence sessions as a step to a more nuanced
understanding of the world. "It's like when you realize your parents
are three-dimensional people. You start off thinking your parents, or
your government, is the best in the world. When that image gets
shattered, at first you blame them for everything that is wrong, but
then you start to see the good with the bad."</TE>
<TE>   The Internet also helps the campers continue on their journey
toward acceptance and understanding when they leave camp. In addition
to a daily list serve, known as SeedsNet, and chat rooms, the
occasional well timed e-mail from a friend from camp can often be the
most meaningful action toward peace.</TE>
<TE>   "If everything that is happening is going on and I can still
receive an e-mail from an Israeli Seed telling me about their
concern, I feel there is hope for the future," said Jawabri. "Seeds
of Peace is the only reason I am hopeful about the crisis in the
Middle East today."</TE>

<LD>Watering becomes important for every plant in the garden now. Most
roots (even tree roots) are in the upper 2 feet of soil, so water
long enough to wet the soil to this depth. Then don't water again
until the soil an inch or two deep dries. Watering too often and not
deep enough kills a lot of plants in California.</LD>
<LD>   In preparation for summer's heat, renew mulch around plants to
keep roots cool and conserve water. Use stringy shredded bark or
partially decomposed homemade compost. Pile it an inch or two thick,
keeping it a few inches from the bases of plants.</LD>

<LD>What Is a Conductor?</LD>
<LD>   Whenever you watch a symphony orchestra, everyone on stage is
playing an instrument--except one person who stands facing the
musicians. That person is the conductor. A conductor is the leader of
the orchestra and has several important duties.</LD>
<LD>   A conductor sets the tempo for a piece of music, so the musicians
know how fast or slow to play. When you see a conductor waving his or
her hands in the air, it's so the musicians can see and follow the
beat of the music.</LD>
<TE>   A conductor also guides the orchestra so that the musicians play
the music the way the composer wanted it played. The musicians can
also tell from the way the conductor moves the baton how loudly or
softly to play, and even when to play an important part.</TE>
<TE>   Most conductors use a small wooden stick, usually painted white,
called a baton, which they hold in one hand while they conduct the
orchestra. In the 17th century, conductors used a large wooden cane,
but it was very heavy and made a lot of noise. Eventually, the batons
got smaller and lighter, like those in use today.</TE>
<TE>   You can observe conducting up close at the Pacific Symphony's
family concert this Saturday morning at the Orange County Performing
Arts Center in Costa Mesa. For more information, call (714) 755-5799
or visit at www.pacificsymphony.org.</TE>

<HD>Wanted: Ladybug Tenants</HD>
<DH>The beetles might be the answer to your aphid problem, but
getting them to stick around can be tricky</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ByY BARBARA WHITAKER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite Valley views, a sound roof and hand-painted details, this
rent-free bungalow in the Hollywood Hills went unused over the
winter.</LD>
<LD>   Even the raisins left for prospective tenants were untouched.</LD>
<LD>   Seems as though ladybugs don't have much enthusiasm for Los
Angeles real estate.</LD>
<TE>   Sitting on the shelf of a local garden center, the Ladybug
Village, a box with a sloping roof and four slits in the front,
seemed like an interesting experiment and it was geared to kids.</TE>
<TE>   But even for insects, a house is not necessarily a home. If
attracting ladybugs is your goal in the garden, providing a roof over
their heads is probably not going to do the trick.</TE>
<TE>   "They're selling you a bill of goods," said Mary Louise Flint, a
Davis-based specialist in integrated pest management for the
University of California.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the house, which was devised as a hibernating box, dressed
up a dreary corner of the garden and piqued an interest in how to
attract ladybugs, or lady beetles to be more accurate.</TE>
<TE>   Ladybugs, which are particularly fond of aphids, are among the
most effective insect predators found in the garden. As adults,
ladybugs will eat about 100 aphids a day, and some of their larger
larvae, which look like tiny, black six-legged alligators with orange
spots, will do the same, Flint said. Ladybugs also have been known to
have an appetite for such garden scourges as scale, spider mites and
mealybugs.</TE>
<TE>   The key is attracting ladybugs and then keeping them in the
garden. This is harder than it may seem because the insects have a
tendency to follow their tummies, flying off to a neighbor's yard
within a day or so in search of food.</TE>
<TE>   Although there are products to lure them and certain plants are
said to be beguiling, the one sure thing ladybugs love is what
gardeners hate: aphids. A cottage industry has grown up around this
relationship, with ladybug collectors working the Sierra Nevada and
coastal ranges of Central California, gathering the convergent lady
beetle, Hippodamia convergens, where the bugs gather en masse and
hibernate.</TE>
<TE>   Although there are hundreds of species of lady beetles, this one,
with its distinctive orange body and black dots, is the most widely
recognized and the most commonly found in California gardens.</TE>
<TE>   With our ladybug house vacant and the aphids camping out on the
roses, it seemed a good time to explore the ins and outs of buying
lady beetles. A variety of suppliers can be found on the Internet. A
quart of ladybugs (that's about 4,500 of them) at $17.50 plus $3.95
shipping seemed a good deal from the Ladybug Co. in Berry Creek,
Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Steel, who runs the company, said the ones shipped earlier
this month would be "old bugs" that have been refrigerated. Once they
get out there, she said, they'll be hungry. To keep the ladybugs in
the yard as long as possible, they should be released in the evening,
because they will not fly at night, and at the base of plants they
will have to climb up. Gently misting them and wetting the area where
they will be released, which provides something for them to drink,
will also help. The Ladybug Co. sells Bio-Control Honeydew to entice
them to stay, but Steel says a 10% sugar solution also will do the
trick.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done quite a bit of research on releasing lady beetles and
what we find is about 95% you release fly away within 12 hours,"
Flint of UC Davis said. "But if you have a high aphid population, a
small percentage of them will stick around and clean up the plant."</TE>
<TE>   The cost of buying the ladybugs was just slightly less than the
nearly $20 it cost to purchase the house, but it was well worth an
afternoon's entertainment for the children in the neighborhood who
delighted in placing them around the garden.</TE>
<TE>   The children even made sure to place a few on that unused
bungalow, which had been properly outfitted last fall with a couple
of water-soaked raisins as attractants. (Raisins, it turns out, were
a cheap alternative to items such as Ladybug Lunch, a powder that
typically costs about $5, and "Eau de Ladybug" ($7.99 for a 2-ounce
bottle), described as a "pheromone-based" liquid that can be used to
lure ladybugs.</TE>
<TE>   (Ladybug aficionados on the Internet suggest simply mixing
one-fourth cup of white sugar with a teaspoon of yeast and 2 cups of
warm water. After the mixture stops foaming add one-half teaspoon
honey and mix into a syrup that can be sprayed where lady beetles are
believed present).</TE>
<TE>   Although the lady beetles and aphids are now gone from my garden,
in the spirit of the experiment, small parts of the garden have been
dedicated to plants that are said to attract beneficial insects,
including ladybugs.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts suggest planting low-growing plants such as alyssum
and clover, which will attract aphids and, in turn, ladybugs. But for
gardeners interested in attracting a broad array of beneficial
insects, any number of plants will provide nectar and pollen and
sources of shelter. Among the top-rated plants for beneficial
boarders are anise hyssop, a summer-blooming perennial with
licorice-scented leaves that is also attractive to butterflies;
golden marguerite; fennel; and mint.</TE>
<TE>   Annuals such as basil, bachelor's button, California poppy,
cosmos, dill, lobelia and sunflowers are said to be effective. And
among a long list of perennials are aster, white lace flower,
catmint, comfrey, coneflower, evening primrose, garlic chives, Korean
mint, lavender, lupine, mint and yarrow.</TE>

that such plants will boost a garden's ladybug population. "But it
makes people more aware of biological control and that's something I
support."</TE>

<DH>Bang &amp; Olufsen reshapes home audio and video by letting
form take the lead.</DH>

<AU>KATHY BRYANT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At Denmark's award-winning Bang &amp; Olufsen, which has been in business
since 1925, design drives the company. "We have had the same
philosophy for the last 50 years," says Ole Bek, president of Bang &amp;
Olufsen, America. "The designer is totally in charge once the basic
idea, often just a cardboard model, is approved. After that there's
no management input at all. That takes a little courage from time to
time, but it's the way we do things."</LD>
<LD>   Design innovations continue today with all-in-one systems like
BeoLink, which allows for all the video and audio components in a
home to be connected and controlled by one single, sleek remote
called the Beo 4, which company officials claim is so simple it can
be operated in the dark. "By pushing one button on this one remote,
you can do 13 different functions that would normally need three
remotes," says Fernando Alfaro, product specialist at South Coast
Plaza's B&amp;O. This follows their idea of simplifying both design and
technology for easy mastery.</LD>
<LD>   "Our products have to be the best because we charge for it," says
Bek. "If we can't do something unique, we just won't do anything."</LD>
<TE>   Some critics say that B&amp;O waits too long to put some products on
the market, like the commercially available flat-screened plasma
television, which has been available from other companies for about
four years. B&amp;O just introduced one in December, with its
high-definition compatible plasma television retailing for about
$10,000. "We were waiting to come out with a plasma TV until we could
get the technology we wanted," says Bek. Plasma TVs in different
brands now run as low as $4,000 for one with a 42-inch screen at
discount stores.</TE>
<TE>   In the home theater showroom of the B&amp;O stores, the thin TV hangs
on the wall with the two small color-coordinated speakers below it.
Additional speakers, which can be hooked to the TV and stereo system,
are tall, standing cylinders available in black, blue, green, red or
aluminum. "Our designers came to us with a pencil, and said they
wanted that to be the shape of the speakers. There was no available
technology to have the speakers in that shape, so it took us two
years to develop them."</TE>
<TE>   Their most successful product to date is the BeoSound 9000,
retailing for about $4,000, which has a radio with six CDs on
display. The spinning CD that is playing creates a colorful moving
design. The unit can be put on a table or hung vertically or
horizontally on the wall. BeoSound 1, a portable, built-in CD/radio
with powerful speakers, is also popular for its organic, curved shape
and is available in five colors with all the controls hidden in back.</TE>
<TE>   The emphasis on design has worked well for the company most of the
time. Bek could only name one product, a television available only in
Europe, that was a great design that nobody bought. "We loved it, but
it didn't sell, so we took it off the market."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Fiell, author of "Scandinavian Design," due out from Taschen
publishing in September, says, "For me, one of the high points of
design at B&amp;O happened in the 1960s and 1970s, with Jacob Jensen's
audio systems. With these, Jensen completely redefined the design
vocabulary of audio equipment and gave the company its unmistakable
identity. You can still very clearly see this language of design in
B&amp;O's products today." In 1978, New York's Museum of Modern Art,
which has 21 B&amp;O products in its permanent design collection,
presented a special Bang &amp; Olufsen exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason for the continuity of their design look is the
small turnover in designers. "David Lewis has been with us for 25
years," says Bek. "He works with a group of around 60 people,
designers, mechanics, engineers, in what we call 'Idealand.'
Sometimes the company sees the need for a new product and sometimes
the Idealand people bring a new concept to us."</TE>
<TE>   According to Fiell, David Lewis' BeoSystem 2500 in 1990 marked
another high point at B&amp;O. "His all-in-one layout was revolutionary
and was critical in differentiating B&amp;O's products within the
marketplace," he says. In the design of this system, Lewis emphasized
function with the flat front of the CD and tape recorder protected by
a shade that slides open when in use. In 1990, the company was
awarded ID Magazine's Classics Prize, the first time the award was
given to a company rather than a product.</TE>
<TE>   "Our single golden rule is that if a product doesn't bring a smile
to your face the first time you see it, we won't create it."
Certainly the glass curtains that open and close on the plasma TV,
the curved telephone for $475 that fits in its triangular stand or
snugly in the hand and the lights that dim or brighten at the touch
of the remote do just that.</TE>
<TE>   "To me," concludes Fiell, "B&amp;O epitomizes the attributes of good
design: durability, unity, integrity and inevitability." Bang &amp;
Olufsen has stores throughout the United States. For more

<LD>Mark stayed up late reading Mr. Yoshiro's book about trees, and for a
while he even forgot he was mad at him.</LD>
<LD>   He was surprised to learn one way to identify trees was by looking
at their leaves. And, he hadn't known that trees give off the oxygen
people need to live.</LD>
<LD>   But he didn't say good morning to Mr. Yoshiro the next day,
anyway.</LD>
<TE>   "Still upset, Mark?" Mr. Yoshiro asked him.</TE>
<TE>   Mark nodded, then sat at his desk.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry if I didn't take you seriously yesterday. I shouldn't
have laughed. You know, I belong to a group that takes field trips to
study trees, and kids are welcome. Think about joining us sometime,
OK?"</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe," Mark muttered and hoped Mr. Yoshiro didn't hear him.</TE>
<TE>   As the sun was going down, Mark went out of his house and leaned
against the rough bark of the tree. He put his feet on the steps, but
there wasn't any place to climb to now.</TE>
<TE>   He thought about all the fun he'd had with Stacey, playing in the
blossoms and climbing the steps, and the longer he stood there, the
more ticked off he got.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Yoshiro just didn't get it. Even though he'd apologized, he
didn't understand that Mark had a right to be mad. Mark had lost
something he liked a whole lot, but all Mr. DiCosta wanted was to be
grumpy.</TE>
<TE>   Then Mark remembered what Mom had said. Was Mr. DiCosta upset
because he'd had to move? Or had he lost something? What if he
thought he had a right to be grouchy, too?</TE>
<TE>   Well, the only way Mark would know was to ask him, like Mr.
Yoshiro said.</TE>
<TE>   He walked toward Mr. DiCosta's house and decided Mr. Yoshiro had
another good idea, too.</TE>
<TE>   He'd begin by talking about trees and then try to find out what
was bothering Mr. DiCosta.</TE>
<TE>   Friday: Will Mr. DiCosta listen?</TE>
<TE>   This is Marjorie Flathers' third jacaranda story for the Kids'
Reading Room. She, too, was shocked when a jacaranda tree near her
home was cut back severely, but she is enjoying the other beautiful
jacarandas in bloom and hopes you are, too. This story will be on The

<HD>His Sense Is to Just Go With the Flow</HD>
<DH>Bill Cox works as a dowser, defying skeptics with his
unusual ability</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELANIE FINN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In most of Southern California, the earth hides its water beneath
rock and sand and mountain. When Steve Andrews and Diane Best began
to build their house deep in the San Bernardino wilderness, 21 rugged
miles from the nearest municipal water tank, they knew they'd have to
dig a well. But, on their square mile of land, where? And how deep?</LD>
<LD>   They asked Bill Cox, a soft-spoken, exceptionally fit octogenarian
who has spent the past 35 years finding secret stashes of water in
the ground beneath the American Southwest, Canada, Japan, Egypt,
Brazil and, mostly, California. He finds it--or dowses--with a stick,
his hands or his "aurameter."</LD>
<LD>   "He marked the ground and told us where to dig, exactly, and said,
'Here. Not 6 inches to the left or right,'" Andrews recalls. Cox had
been hired to dowse a nearby plot and liked their land so much he
offered to waive his $600-plus fee. "He told us we'd have an
excellent well, that there was a confluence of three different water
courses."</LD>
<TE>   They had Errol Smith, a well digger based in Big Bear, drill on
the spot marked by Cox, and he hit water at 125 feet, 140 feet, and
160 feet. The resulting well yielded 30 gallons per minute, more than
twice the amount needed for domestic use. Smith once believed dowsing
was quackery, but, he says, after 45 years of drilling he's seen it
work too many times. Dowsing is the ancient art of locating lost or
hidden objects, usually water, through heightened intuition or some
subconscious connection to water's energy--or so its practitioners
claim. Cox, 81, calls it "clairsentience"--extrasensory touching.</TE>
<TE>   The most common form of dowsing involves a forked switch, which,
held lightly in the hands, twitches to indicate a water source
beneath the soil. Dowsers, also known as water diviners or water
witches, have been practicing for at least 1,000 years in Europe.
Many cultures throughout the world have similar traditions.</TE>
<TE>   Cox's experience of water is intense: half meditation, half
vision. He says he feels, sees, tastes and hears the underground
water; his aurameter, a flexible steel rod, simply amplifies his
senses. Sitting in the living room of his home in the Ojai hills,
quiet but for the burble of an ornamental waterfall,  Cox recalls one
instance: "I was locating a well site, and it was as if [in my mind]
I was being lowered down a well shaft with a miner's cap. I was going
down through different levels; I could call out the different strata
formations I was seeing. And then the water."</TE>
<TE>   His English wife, Davina, adds, "He called out the strata, and I
wrote them all down, and when the client drilled the well, Bill had
been correct about everything."</TE>
<TE>   His favorite jobs are "lost causes, when no one else can find
water." He has written nine books, lectures worldwide and is renowned
in dowsing circles. He has had more than 400 clients, including
schools, water companies and ranches.</TE>
<TE>   He predicts where and how deep the water is, whether it is hot or
cold, whether it flows horizontally or vertically, and how many
gallons per minute are available. And he does this, he says in his
quiet, still manner, with an accuracy rate of 80% to 93%.</TE>
<TE>   Such claims are roundly dismissed by hydrologists and geologists
who rely on detailed maps and a kind of underground X-ray called
electrical resistivity to detect water, minerals and oil. Bernard W.
Pipkin, professor emeritus of earth sciences at USC, finds dowsing
very amusing. "These guys are like Mayberry," he says, referring to
TV's "The Andy Griffith Show."</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever success they have is based on local knowledge. These
guys know the land and where water is most likely to be found--and
some of them are very good," allows Pipkin. Beyond that, he says, "to
believe in dowsing you have to have a willingness to believe in the
paranormal. There is nothing scientific about what they do."</TE>
<TE>   A 1986 study of dowsers in Germany reached an ambiguous
conclusion. Five hundred self-proclaimed dowsers were asked to
pinpoint a water pipe hidden beneath the floor of a barn. Forty-three
exhibited exceptional skill, which, the study noted, could not be
attributed to mere chance and, "a real core of dowser-phenomena can
be regarded as empirically proven."</TE>
<TE>   Not so, counters Jim Enright, retired professor emeritus of
behavioral physiology at UC San Diego. The 43 "skilled" dowsers were
not able to repeat their performance, he points out in a 1999
rebuttal in the Skeptical Inquirer. In fact, he writes, the data was
persuasive disproof of the dowsers' abilities.</TE>
<TE>   But none of this concerns Cox--or the legion of amateur and
professional dowsers throughout the world. The American Society of
Dowsers in Danville, Vt., has more than 4,000 members and holds
conferences and workshops nationwide. Members are a curious mix of
old-timers who wander the fields with forked willow sticks, and New
Agers who embrace the power of the right brain, the cabala and ESP.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1960s, then a writer and musician in Santa Barbara,
Cox was asked to co-write a book on dowsing with a respected
California practitioner, Verne Cameron. "I had no intention of
dowsing myself," says Cox. "It sounded like someone dropping off to
sleep."</TE>
<TE>   The two spent time in the field, and, when Cameron became weak
from cancer, Cox carried him on his back. He was impressed with
Cameron's talent; then one day, Cox arrived late at a site and
Cameron asked him what he thought. "I took [the aurameter] and said,
'It looks like 11 gallons a minute at 225 feet and 96 degrees.' I had
the figures almost spot on." When Cameron died shortly thereafter,
Cox took over his client list.</TE>
<TE>   Cox has also expanded on Cameron's theory of "primary water,"
which states that heat and geochemical action in and above the
Earth's magma create water, which is urged upward as steam through
seismic faults and rock fissures. This water, produced inside the
Earth, Cox says, is totally independent of climate changes, and
therefore perpetual.</TE>
<TE>   "Impossible," says professor Pipkin. "There is water, but it gets
tied up with minerals. It would never be potable by the time it
reaches the surface."</TE>
<TE>   But for Cox and his wife, the line between possible and impossible
cannot be so definitively drawn. A few years ago, Cox was hired by a
school on Awaji Island in western Japan to locate a new well because
the water in the school's existing well was heavily contaminated by
iron and barely potable.</TE>
<TE>   Jitso Tanagi, chairman of the board of directors for Yanagi Gakuen
Schools, says he was initially doubtful about dowsing, but more
conventional hydrology methods had failed.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, Cox found them good water. "We now not only have a
constant and stable supply of good water, which doesn't depend on
meteorological conditions," says Tanagi, "but through Mr. Cox, we
have also become reacquainted with the bountifulness of nature."</TE>
<TE>   The school built a 5-by-5-foot monument over their treasured well
in honor of Cox and his wife. Tanagi notes, "We learned from Mr. and
Mrs. Cox of the wonderful potential of the human senses and the human
brain."</TE>

<LD>   Art</LD>
<LD>   Marilyn will be there. Jackie and Elvis too. Add some flowers, a
little disaster, a few Campbell's Soup cans and you've got the
makings of a colorful show that could only be about Andy Warhol. The
highly anticipated ''Andy Warhol Retrospective'' arrives at MOCA on
Saturday for a three-month stay after a hugely popular run at
London's Tate Gallery. Billed as the first comprehensive exhibition
of Warhol's work presented here in more than 30 years, the extensive
survey will feature more than 200 paintings, drawings and sculptures
that bridge the worlds of commercial and fine art.</LD>

<TE>   Theater</TE>
<TE>   Athol Fugard will direct the West Coast premiere of his new drama
"Sorrows and Rejoicings." Like Fugard's best work, the play
interweaves the political with the personal. Set in his Karoo
homeland, it explores the legacy of apartheid on a white South
African poet--exiled for speaking out against the racist regime--and
on two women in his life, one white, one black. The cast includes
Brienin Nequa Bryant, John Glover, Judith Light and Cynthia Martells.</TE>

<TE>   The American Cinematheque salutes one of the maverick director of
the 1950s with the seven-film series Ride Lonesome: A Tribute to Budd
Boetticher and the Randolph Scott Westerns. Boetticher, who died in
November at age 85, had trained as a bullfighter in Mexico before
moving to Hollywood, where he made his mark with half a dozen western
morality plays that starred Scott as an archetypal loner seeking
justice.</TE>

Westerns, Lloyd E. Rigler Theatre at the Egyptian, 6712 Hollywood
Blvd., Hollywood. "7 Men From Now" and "The Tall T," Friday, 7:30

<TE>   The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County says don't smash
that spider. Bring it in to their first-ever California spider
survey. Just coax any local arachnid--alive--into a plastic bottle
and bring it to the museum's 16th annual Insect Fair this weekend.
While you're there, check out the displays of living and preserved
insects, plus bug art, books and jewelry.</TE>

<TE>   Opera</TE>
<TE>   Italian composer Luciano Berio has written a new ending for
Puccini's "Turandot," the portion the composer left undone at his
death. This new resolution, which replaces the standard one written
by Franco Alfano, will be heard for the first time in an opera house
when Los Angeles Opera unveils its new "Turandot" with a cast
including Audrey Stottler, Franco Farina, Hei-Kyung Hong and Rosendo
Flores.</TE>
<TE>   "Turandot," Los Angeles Opera at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion,
135 N. Grand Ave., downtown L.A., Saturday, 7:30 p.m. $34 to $165.

<TE>   Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   The mini Swedish Invasion that looked like a pop oddity a few
months ago is suddenly gathering force, having linked up with the
larger rising rock tide of the return-to-raw represented by the
Strokes, the White Stripes, et al. The Hives are riding that wave
onto radio and into the hearts of the new garage-rock generation.
Their Roxy show figures to be a wall-rattling introduction.</TE>
<TE>   The Hives, the Roxy, 9009 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, Monday, 8
p.m. Also Tuesday. (310) 278-9457. Both shows sold out.</TE>

<LD>"Who's on third?" a teenage girl in the stands pipes up.</LD>
<LD>   "No, Who's on first," someone else in the next section wisecracks.</LD>
<LD>   At tiny Sam Lynn Ballpark, home of the California League's
Bakersfield Blaze, a Single A franchise of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays,
the seats are so close to the action that you can hear everything,
even the faint whoosh of the on-deck hitter's practice swing.</LD>
<TE>   The Rancho Cucamonga Quakes are on their way to beating the Blaze,
6-2, but minor league baseball isn't about winning games or even
winning seasons. It's about the pure, in-the-moment pleasure of the
sport. How could it be otherwise for die-hard fans who know that
every player on the field will be gone, either moving up or getting
cut, by this time next year?</TE>
<TE>   Everything that is missing from the major league game can be found
in minor league parks (only for teams affiliated with major league
clubs) dotted around the L.A. area, in San Bernardino, Lake Elsinore,
Visalia, and Lancaster. In Bakersfield, the reserved seats are $6
(and even the $4 general admission seats are good), the hot dogs are
$2, kids in uniform get in free, and the prize for the "dirtiest car
in the parking lot" contest is a free car wash.</TE>
<TE>   But underneath all the homespun charm runs the electric
possibility of catching a sneak preview of baseball history. Imagine
what it must have been like to watch Pedro Martinez pitch his first
game of pro ball. Ken Eddy, who has been a season ticket holder since
he retired from the Kern County Sheriff's Department in 1989, has
seen Martinez, Mike Piazza, Eric Karros, Raoul Mondesi, Hideo Nomo
and Paul LoDuca in action. "I was even here the one night Orel
Hershiser pitched," Eddy remembers. "He was rotating through on
rehab."</TE>
<TE>   Eddy won't say who his favorite player is this year, because as a
member of the booster club, he "adopts" a different player every
season, offering free rides, advice and the occasional home-cooked
meal. The dinners are especially welcome, since million-dollar
signing bonuses are reserved for a handful of hot prospects. The
average Single A ballplayer earns $600 to $800 a month, according to
Blaze assistant general manager Brian Thomas. "The rest of the year,
they're working at Radio Shack."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, silence falls when No. 22, Josh Hamilton, steps up to the
plate for his first at-bat. Hamilton was the No. 1 draft pick in
1999, and the second high schooler ever to be drafted in that top
spot. A-Rod was the first. Hamilton, bless his soul, hits it out of
the park.</TE>

<LD>Sometimes the stares throw her. Then Lorna Lourenco remembers: Not
every mother of two tools around the high desert in a vintage hearse.</LD>
<LD>   Lourenco's husband and kids were among the shocked three years ago
when she traded her Dodge Omni and $500 for a beat-up 1974 Cadillac
Fleetwood Miller-Meteor high-top. Now that the hearse count is up to
four, the surprise has worn off, and family, friends and neighbors
all pitch in to help the Lourencos run Phelan-based Gothic Limos.
Clients from L.A. to Las Vegas pay about $500 to stretch out for a
night of the living dead.</LD>
<LD>   Lourenco and her husband, David, outfit each with mood music,
black lighting and a "slumber chamber." They and others chauffeur to
gothic weddings, cemetery tours and over-the-hill parties. This
summer they'll add tours of locations in the HBO series "Six Feet
Under," which is fueling the rise of hearse chic. "Used to be we'd
get the evil eye from everyone but bikers and fringe people," she
said. "But now drivers in BMWs and SUVs give us the thumbs-up."</LD>
<TE>   Besides the '74 she calls Baby Doll, the fleet includes an '86
Cadillac Fleetwood she named the S.S. Goth, a '62 Caddy called Sixth
Sense and a yet-to-be-named '68 she and her husband recently drove
home from Texas. That's right, Lourenco's been through the desert in
a hearse with no name.</TE>

<LD>There is rich terrain to explore beyond the borders of your own
neighborhood, no matter where you've drawn that metaphoric line. To
the south lies San Diego with its distinctive entertainment and
cultural mix. Head east and eventually urban sprawl melts into a
desertscape that is as breathtaking as it is unforgiving. North has
its own set of treasures in Ojai's artists' enclave and Santa
Barbara's historic district and tempting beaches, accessorized with
barbecue pits on the sand--a trend worth spreading.</LD>
<LD>   All of which is to say, when you've tired of your own environs and
the local beach has lost its early-season allure, look beyond ...
where the options are virtually unlimited.</LD>
<LD>   A change of pace is only a short drive away. The challenge comes
in choosing a direction.</LD>
<TE>   In the grab bag of possibilities, take 10 of your closest friends
out for an ostrich egg brunch. Don't have 10 friends? Try the emu
omelet for five. Watch the up-and-coming sluggers and string players
at their summer jobs. Or leave your worries behind at Sycamore
Springs, where stress evaporates in hot tubs of bubbling mineral
water. For stargazing, don't think Beverly Hills or Hollywood.
There's a solar eclipse this summer, and the best viewing is
definitely out of town.</TE>
<TE>   Tired of driving? Hop a train instead. The trip to San Diego is as
relaxing as the destination. Or if you like your trips with more
edge, there's Burning Man, or the shaking ladies of the Miss Exotic
World competition.</TE>

<LD>Yearning for a little Schubert under a setting sun? Pack a blanket, a
picnic and a good bottle of wine, and head to Santa Barbara, where
some of the most promising instrumental and vocal students from all
over the world have gathered for their summer studies.</LD>
<LD>   That's right. It's summer school for these not-quite-yet
professionals at the Music Academy of the West, and we're invited to
observe as they fine-tune their musical talents.</LD>
<LD>   Orchestral, chamber and vocal concerts begin June 24 and are
scheduled throughout the summer, including performances by famed
faculty such as mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne, and academy alum David
Weiss, who is the principal oboe for the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
Ticket prices vary, but none will tax even a starving student's bank
account.</LD>
<TE>   For an A-plus musical experience, take your seat in the classroom
and watch as these students work to make the grade.</TE>
<TE>   Master classes, usually held during the day, are offered in every
instrument, including voice. Students perform, listen to critiques,
then perform again.</TE>
<TE>   "So often the audience learns that these lessons relate to their
own lives," says Diane Eagle Kataoka, the school's director of
communications. "You must sing from your heart, and don't we need to
live from our hearts as well?"</TE>
<TE>   Particularly popular is the school's Picnic Concert series, which
begins July 5 and runs through Aug. 16. Before the music begins at
7:30 p.m., stake out a secluded spot on the lushly landscaped grounds
overlooking the Pacific Ocean.</TE>

<LD>A ll markets carry eggs labeled "jumbo" and "extra-large," but
Ostrich Land puts those little huevos to shame. Just north of Santa
Barbara near Solvang, the 33-acre ranch breeds the world's largest
birds, and offers their "Flintstones"-sized eggs to the public.</LD>
<LD>   Each egg weighs 3 to 4 pounds, and requires a hammer and
screwdriver to crack its thick shell. At $20 a pop, they're not
cheap, but one egg makes omelets for 10 and adds flair to any brunch.</LD>
<LD>   The taste? Just like chicken eggs.</LD>
<TE>   The ranch's 45 ostriches roam in a vast, desert-like pen that
approximates their natural African habitat. Take a gander, and you
might spy the odd birds nesting or mating--one of the goofiest, most
awkward courtship rituals on the planet. Or you might catch them
stretching their knobby legs at upward of 40 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Don't expect to hop on. Territorial creatures, ostriches bite and
charge, and can disembowel a man with one kick, making petting,
feeding and riding off limits to guests.</TE>
<TE>   Says owner Knut Siegfried: "The birds don't even want to be
touched. They're happy out there, they do their own thing."</TE>
<TE>   As consolation, visitors can pay 25 cents to feed a corral of
emus, the ostrich's slightly smaller, less feisty cousin. Also for
sale: crafts made from ostrich leather, feathers and shells, and
frozen ostrich meat ... a lean alternative for those summer
barbecues.</TE>

<LD>San Francisco's award-winning Exploratorium, which has been knocking
every speck of dust from the word "museum" since 1969, continues its
cheeky through-the-looking-glass approach to the riddles of human
perception.</LD>
<LD>   Its latest eye-popper, "Seeing," debuts June 29 and runs through
January, and although some of its 70 exhibits last only a month, a
week or a day, there's still enough on display to cause an
exhilarating sensory overload.</LD>
<LD>   Tickle your rods and cones for two weekends with the "Seeing Film
Series," which showcases 10 short films on the nature of color. Feel
super-smart with "Light and the Eye," a 15-exhibit collection that
delivers the anatomical precision of an optometry course, minus the
boredom. (Whatever you may do with your eyes at the Exploratorium,
closing them is not a viable option.)</LD>
<TE>   Experience a not-so-old-fashioned Rorschach test with Paul
Kaiser's "Inkblot Perceptions," if you don't mind a little
psychological probing. In July, check out the wizardly Sara Crasson,
whose illuminating magic show relies as much on science as
sleight-of-hand.</TE>
<TE>   And if you just want to look on in sheer awe, don't miss
"Evidence" by Judith Scott, a 59-year-old sculptor with Down Syndrome
whose inability to hear or speak is more than matched by her visual
imagination.</TE>
<TE>   If you've been trying to justify your sudden impulse to head north
and "I wanted to make sure the Golden Gate Bridge was still there"
just won't cut it, look no further. Figuratively speaking.</TE>

<TE>   If all the world's a stage, the little-known Ojai Playwrights
Conference has some stiff competition. But it could soon burst forth
from its relative anonymity. It was founded in 1997 by a group of
designers, directors and actors who wanted to create a retreat for
deserving writers. This year, seasoned playwrights Arthur L. Kopit
and Jon Robin Baitz are among those whose new work will get a staged
reading. "The plays we help develop have never been produced before,"
says producing director Emanuel Treeson, "but each reflects some
aspect of what we as folks living in this world are faced with every
day."</TE>

<TE>   Forget Julia, Gwyneth and Brad. For real stargazing in L.A., your
best bet is to get away from Hollywood's lights. To where, exactly?
The short answer from Tim Thompson, president of the Los Angeles
Astronomical Society: "Anyplace dark."</TE>
<TE>   Dark skies are disappearing north and south of L.A., Thompson
says, as the cities sprawl. For the blackest skies with the best
star-spotting potential, head east. "Joshua Tree National Park is
probably the best place to look for stars," Thompson says. He
recommends Cottonwood Springs Campground, where there are
"astronomers all over the place," and novices can look over the
shoulder of a kindly scientist.</TE>
<TE>   For a more formal star-map tour, you could join one of the Los
Angeles Astronomical Society's "Star Parties." The next big party, at
the Griffith Observatory grounds, marks a special event: a partial
solar eclipse June 10, 5:13-7:23 p.m., which will be the last solar
eclipse we'll see in Los Angeles until 2012.</TE>

<TE>   In 1986, Larry Harvey and 20 of his pals gathered on the sands of
a San Francisco beach and burned a wooden figure in honor of the
summer solstice. From this small act of pagan subversion sprang a
grand celebration of performance, music and tribal love now known as
Burning Man. This year, about 30,000 revelers are expected to gather
in the desert heat to sing, dance and howl at the moon. So, if your
quest for self-discovery includes running around naked in the desert,
this is the summer event for you. Bring an open mind. And plenty of
sunscreen.</TE>

<TE>   "Burlesque is back!" bubbles Dixie Evans, the legendary 1950s-era
striptease artist. "The new young gals are really in touch with the
spirit and the performances of the golden age of burlesque, and it's
sexier than ever." Evans' museum is an outrageous shrine to famous
strippers and the contest is the Olympics of stripping. Past
performers have been inspired to such greatness as bursting out of a
huge Campbell's soup can to sexing up the Little Mermaid. Can
gorgeous 2001 winner Cherry Malone defend her crown against such
legends as Tempest Storm and follies great Stacy Farrell?</TE>

<LD>In 1886, while drilling for oil in the Avila Valley, two men struck
not the proverbial black gold, but a vein of hot, mineral-rich spring
water. The Avila Sulfur Springs--or the Oil Wells as they were then
known--may not have brought in the riches the men might have hoped
for, but the warm waters certainly did wonders to soothe aching
muscles and frazzled nerves. The wells' striking location just off
the rocky coast of the Pacific quickly made it a favorite spot for
city folk and local farmers. .</LD>
<LD>   Today the Sycamore Mineral Springs Resort sits at the site of the
original wells, a swank hotel and spa whose piece de resistance is
the collection of numerous redwood hot tubs perched high along a
green and wooded hillside.</LD>
<LD>   Each private pool sits in leafy seclusion, steaming sulfur water
piped in directly from the natural springs below. This placid oasis
is open 24 hours a day, providing a seductive respite for weary
travelers cruising this scenic stretch of Highway 101.</LD>
<TE>   For those who prefer to linger in luxury, the Sycamore provides a
variety of guest rooms (as well as a private guest cottage), each
boasting its own outdoor tub. Sycamore offers full spa services and
hosts weddings for those wishing to tie the knot amid hot-spring
decadence.</TE>
<TE>   The resort sits just off Avila Beach, close to the kitschy Madonna
Inn, a 45-minute drive south of Hearst Castle. For those making the
hike from L.A., your rest stops can include lunch in Santa Barbara,
wine at the coastal vineyards, or sausage and sauerkraut in Solvang
Village. If you prefer the straight shoot, just three hours and a
tank of gas will deliver you straight into the arms of warm-water
bliss.</TE>

<LD>The dog days of summer can leave those far from the ocean feeling
landlocked and parched. Though getting out into nature sounds like
the solution, spending an hour in the car does not. Urban hikes, in
places like Griffith Park or Runyon Canyon, sometimes yield little
more than increased dust-and-sun exposure.</LD>
<LD>   For a shady, moist excursion, take the 210 East to Pasadena, exit
Windsor, head north, and park in the lot at Windsor Avenue and
Ventura Street. Several hundred yards further on is the Arroyo Seco
trailhead. While the first half-mile is pavement (though with a dandy
view across Devil's Gate Reservoir to JPL), the trail soon winds
beneath a verdant canopy of live oak, sycamore, Douglas fir and
willow trees. The path goes through a botanist's dream of local flora
and fauna, including some truly Space Age-looking cacti. Alongside it
all runs the misnamed Arroyo Seco ("dry creek"), which keeps things
cool and melodic as it flows over boulders and through shaded
grottoes and under scenic bridges.</LD>
<LD>   The first few miles offer plenty of sun-dappled picnic areas
(though no drinking water; pack your own) and trail-riding (both
horse and bike), serious hikers can carry on to the Gabrielino Trail
and Switzer Falls, a 50-foot cascade that goes some way toward
dispelling the reality of a low-desert summer.</LD>

<LD>T he fact that car washes dot nearly every corner of the San Fernando
Valley should tell us something: We love our vehicles, but not enough
to get our hands dirty buffing and polishing them.</LD>
<LD>   Arsen Stambultsyan, owner of Triple Shine Auto Detail in Glendale,
found it gets worse. There are some who don't even want to drive to
the car wash, so Stambultsyan will pick up and return cars to owners
in Burbank and Glendale. That'll double the price of a car wash, to
$20, but it's free if the car gets a $90 to $120 detailing. "People
are lazy," Stambultsyan said. "But that's OK. It's good for
business."</LD>
<LD>   For those who do it themselves--drive, that is--the reward is a
chance to see some of the few remaining Space Age-themed car washes
in the area. They were built when aerospace was king and Googie
wasn't kitsch. Entrepreneurs bought the car wash pieces from sheet
metal companies, stuck them together, and opened the doors. The
stylized shells, with towering fins and pylons, remain intact at
places like National Car Wash in Valley Village, Magnolia Car Wash
and Lakeside Car Wash in Burbank.</LD>
<TE>   "They're a very significant set of artifacts," said Matt Roth,
historian at the Automobile Club of Southern California. "They're a
testament to people's faith in technology after the war."</TE>
<TE>   The mechanized guts that were de rigueur at the time, though, have
been ripped out and replaced by hand washing. A throwback, or the
ultimate in modern paint-job-sensitive sophistication? Doesn't
matter, as long as it's not our hands, right?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Just thinking about summer in the San Fernando Valley caused us to
overheat. We rang up some rockers, a punk and a diva to find out how
they keep their cool under that searing Valley sun. Sherman Oaks
resident Dave King, the singer of the Irish punk band Flogging Molly,
was the first to pick up. "Guess what I'm doing right this second?
Suckin' on a lolly. That's how I stay cool." A lolly, the Dublin-born
musician informed us, is a Popsicle in Irish-speak. Favorite flavor:
grape. Woodland Hills R&amp;B singer Truth Hurts, who's currently heating
up the charts with her Dr. Dre-produced single "Addictive," says she
heeds the call of the mall. "I go to Nordstrom in Woodland Hills and
always like cooling down at Barney's in Beverly Hills." The smooth
operator says she keeps a cup of ice handy and never turns on her AC.
"It's really bad for your voice and your health, so I surround myself
with lots of fans" ... not the kind that want autographs. Jose
Pasillas II, drummer for the rock band Incubus, cools his jets in
Calabasas at the Santa Fe Cafe. "Eat a burrito from Santa Fe, with
chicken, black beans, guacamole, sour cream, jalapenos and onions,
and all of your worries will subside," he says. "Even the heat won't
get to you."</LD>

<HD>And Down the Stretch They Come ... to Have Breakfast</HD>

<LD>In the land where the buff bod rules, where "one more crunch" is the
mantra of the most fit, there exists an elite group of athletes that
let you sit and admire them exercise.</LD>
<LD>   It's 7:30 a.m. at Santa Anita, and a small slew of thoroughbreds
have taken to the turf for their morning workout. And sipping hot
coffee on a patio situated perfectly at the top of the stretch is a
loyal group of racing enthusiasts who come every morning to mingle
with the jockeys, owners and trainers, and while they're at it, have
a bit of breakfast. It's called Clockers' Corner, a breakfast eatery
named after the clockers--analysts who spend their early mornings
with stopwatches and notepads studying the equine elite.</LD>
<LD>   During the racing season, a full breakfast menu is offered at this
trackside restaurant and Bob Baffert, Gary Stevens and other
personalities of the racing biz are regularly found hanging about. In
the summer months the mood relaxes, the pace slows down, but
Clockers' Corner does not close. In fact, a reasonably priced
continental menu is offered in the off-season every day from 7:30 to
10 a.m.</LD>
<TE>   And even though the competitive 2-year-olds have moved on to
Hollywood Park and Del Mar, you can still get a glimpse of some of
the world's most promising up-and-comers. Many trainers like Baffert
and Paco Gonzalez maintain stables at Santa Anita in the off-season
and continue to train here.</TE>

<LD>Myths abound about the creation of ice cream, but we do know that the
frozen treat landed on the shores of the North American continent
just as the states were thinking of uniting. No wonder ice cream
still smacks of a nostalgic Americana. We scoured the ice cream
parlors of the valleys to find the best that the suburbs have to
offer.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Fosselman's in Alhambra</LD>
<TE>   1824 W. Main St., Alhambra, (626) 282-6533</TE>
<TE>   www.fosselmans.com</TE>
<TE>   There's no skimping here, not on the butterfat (16%) or the
portions (gi-normous). "Our philosophy is, if you're going to
indulge, it better be good," said Bob Fosselman, son of the company's
founder. Nearly 50 flavors of ice cream, sherbet and sorbet are
churned out on the premises of this family-owned shop, which is now
run by the third generation of Fosselmans. They take their cues on
new flavors from the ethnically diverse community around Alhambra and
Los Angeles chefs, who ask for special blends. Among the current
choices: taro root, ube, green tea, lychee nut and macapuno.
Mainstays include peppermint stick and cherry vanilla. One of the
bestsellers in summer is peach, and though sherbet and sorbet do well
in hot weather, it's still the full-force ice cream that brings in
the mostly adult crowds. Winner: Most Decadent and Most Imaginative
Flavors.</TE>
<TE>   Fair Oaks Pharmacy &amp; Soda Fountain</TE>
<TE>   1526 Mission St., South Pasadena, (626) 799-1414</TE>
<TE>   www.fairoakspharmacy.net</TE>
<TE>   It's the real deal, and it sits directly on the "mother road,"
Route 66. This neighborhood fixture was restored in the late '80s to
turn-of-the-20th-century glory. The soda fountain, complete with
antique stained-glass cabinets, marble-topped counters, chrome bar
stools and original Hamilton Beach malt mixers, came from a 1900s
pharmacy in Missouri. The fare: comfy food throwbacks like egg
creams, vanilla Cokes, phosphates, banana splits, milkshakes and
floats. The butterscotch sundaes are super-swell. Winner: Best Step
Back in Time.</TE>
<TE>   Pegadoe's Frozen Custard</TE>
<TE>   603 N. Hollywood Way, Burbank, (818) 558-6856</TE>
<TE>   www.pegadoes.com</TE>
<TE>   Technically, it's not ice cream, it's frozen custard (extra egg
yolks, less air, half the butterfat), and it's popular back East and
in the Midwest. It tastes like ice cream, though, only better.
Mix-ins like cookie crumbs and candy are available, but who needs
them? The flavors--including German chocolate cake, English toffee,
pistachio and blueberry--can easily stand alone. Milwaukee native and
shop owner Mary Talsky keeps eggnog and pumpkin on the menu
year-round. She also makes floats with classics like Bubble Up, Nehi
soda and Sprecher Root Beer. Winner: Best Midwestern Import.</TE>
<TE>   Neighborhood Ice Cream Truck</TE>
<TE>   Locations vary</TE>
<TE>   This roving vestige of a laid-back suburbia is still in evidence
all around the San Fernando Valley. Hear the tinny little recorded
tune wafting through the streets, and you know he's coming. Kids can
file up to the window with 50 cents and come away with a treat.
There's everything from jawbreakers and bubble gum to lemon bombs and
push-ups. Winner: Most Convenient.</TE>
<TE>   Farrell's Ice Cream Parlour</TE>
<TE>   21516 Golden Triangle Road, Santa Clarita,</TE>
<TE>   (661) 253-4386</TE>
<TE>   Who can forget the Pig's Trough and the Zoo, and all the
siren-wailing commotion they caused? That was back when we were kids
and we actually wanted people to stop and stare as we plowed into a
mountain of ice cream. There used to be 140 of these Disney-esque
restaurants, which were wildly popular in the '70s and '80s and began
disappearing. Now, another has resurfaced in the Mountasia Family Fun
Center, a mini amusement park in Santa Clarita. It's open now, with a
full ice cream menu and limited food. The grand opening is scheduled
for June 1. Mountasia's owners, Dave and Mike Fleming, who also run
Northridge's Skateland, plan to replicate the original restaurants
right down to the Hot Fudge Volcanoes, Pike's Peaks and "I Made a Pig
of Myself at Farrell's" ribbons. Winner: Best Rebirth of a Nostalgia
Restaurant Chain.</TE>

<LD>The valleys and foothills here ring the city in a way that makes Los
Angeles unforgettable. For many, the 'burbs are the silver lining
around L.A.'s gritty inner self--until, of course, the temperatures
rise and smog cuts a dense cinnamon band across the horizon.</LD>
<LD>   There's an idealistic quality to the suburbs that is perfectly
suited to summer. It's where the American Dream leads, right? To
backyard pools warming in the sun, burgers on the grill and
neighborhood kids playing baseball in the street. Of course, our
suburbs--from Calabasas to Covina, from Anaheim to Azusa--have more
distinct flavor. Tandoori chicken on the barbecue. Soccer in the
street. But everyone around the pool.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, there are days when being out of doors in the 'burbs is not
the destination of choice. Malls and movie theaters fill up, and the
chillier the AC the better. Still, with a little searching, relief is
just around the corner. Don't run, hide or head for that pool, just
read on to find a few entries for that summer suburban "to do" list.</LD>
<TE>   Spend an early morning over a steaming cup of coffee watching
thoroughbreds train. Pull on hiking shoes and head for Arroyo Seco,
where trees form enough of a cool canopy to make the effort more than
worth it. Take a chance on the new roller coasters, or, heck, a
lesson on a trapeze. Or kick back and let someone else do the heavy
lifting at one of the architecturally exotic car washes that litter
the area.</TE>
<TE>   And that's just for starters.</TE>

<LD>In the 'burbs, daily life can contain the whimsy of the circus and
the nostalgia trip of a drive-in movie.</LD>
<LD>   Mastering the</LD>
<LD>   Greatest of Ease</LD>
<TE>   Gaona's Trapeze School</TE>
<TE>   5702 Lubao Ave., Woodland Hills</TE>
<TE>   (818) 710-8191</TE>
<TE>   Even though she had always dreamed about it, Karen Frischmann
initially couldn't muster the courage to fulfill her lifelong
fantasy. "For as long as I can remember, I've wanted to get on a
trapeze," says Frischmann, a Pilates instructor from West Hollywood,
"but I still couldn't stop shaking during my first class."</TE>
<TE>   Students at Richie Gaona's Trapeze School must check any fears at
the door. Within 30 minutes, they're strapped into safety harnesses,
ready to ascend the 24-foot ladder and reach out to clutch a trapeze
bar. Over the last five years, Gaona, a fourth-generation circus
performer, has trained hundreds of aspiring trapeze artists on a
massive rig in the backyard of his Woodland Hills home. The intimate
90-minute workshops cost $40 and cover basic flying positions,
catching maneuvers and landing techniques. The results are
thrilling--and addictive. "I hate to sound sacrilegious," says Tom
Moore, a film and TV director from Los Angeles, "but it's like seeing
God when you get caught."</TE>

<TE>   Perfect Parking</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Vineland Drive-In</TE>
<TE>   443 N. Vineland Ave.,</TE>
<TE>   City of Industry</TE>
<TE>   $5.50. First-run movies.</TE>
<TE>   (626) 961-9262</TE>
<TE>   I know it's truly summer in L.A. when it's time to slide behind
the wheel of my '66 T-Bird and head for the City of Industry. At the
Vineland Drive-In, I pay, park and settle in for a double feature. I
started hitting drive-ins here a decade ago, making big circles
around the county to visit them all--Inglewood, Culver City, Long
Beach, Chatsworth, Van Nuys. One by one, they closed and dropped off
the map. The fate of the Azusa Foothill Drive-In--the last California
drive-in on Route 66--is up in the air. It's closed now while the
owner, Azusa Pacific University, decides what to do with the
property. It's worth driving by to see its etched-in-the-mountains,
neon-lighted charm.</TE>
<TE>   But for year-round film viewing, there's only the Vineland. Built
during the drive-in heyday of the 1950s, the Vineland can fit 1,600
cars in front of its four screens. Sure, it lacks some of the style
and architectural verve of those that have come and gone, but it's
significant, still, that it hasn't yet been cleared to make way for a
Wal-Mart or a multiplex.</TE>

<TE>   Cold Spring Rolls</TE>
<TE>   Favori Restaurant</TE>
<TE>   3502 W. 1st St., Santa Ana</TE>
<TE>   (714) 531-6838</TE>
<TE>   What a perfect nosh for a hot, sweaty summer day--bite into their
fresh, cold spring rolls and you'll be hooked. Rolled neatly into a
piece of thin, cool, slightly chewy rice paper are shredded lettuce,
carrots, mung sprouts, mint leaves, tender bay shrimp and slivers of
flavorful pork, all of which you dip into the sweet, purple hoisin
sauce. There's also the simpler version with shredded pork, lettuce
and mint, which you flavor with a splash of fish sauce. Equally good,
just not as crunchy.</TE>

<TE>   One-Stop Shop</TE>

<TE>   14556 Ventura Blvd.,</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks</TE>
<TE>   (818) 382-3444</TE>
<TE>   As savvy Valley shoppers know, Handmade Galleries on Ventura
Boulevard is one-stop shopping for last-minute gifts or some personal
pampering. Say that the barbecue starts at 4 p.m. and it's already
3:37. No problema. The colorful artists' emporium is a hotbed of
ideas. You can show off a pinkie-fresh pedicure with Hand Made's
trendy toe rings or shimmer while you tan with a selection of
glittery body lotion. "It's all rented space, so you're supporting
individual artists," says manager Amanda Vernon. "We try to keep it
eclectic and interesting, even if it's not 100% handmade, it's gotta
have something special."</TE>

<TE>   8136 N. Sepulveda, Van Nuys</TE>
<TE>   (818) 780-6701</TE>
<TE>   This hole-in-the-wall prides itself on having "no ambience" but a
"beef brisket that tastes like milk in your mouth." The meat cooks
for eight to nine hours in a wood pit, making it spoon tender with
just enough smoky tang to hit the spot. Add classic Texas fixins'
like the sweet BBQ beans and creamy coleslaw laced with plump
raisins, and you'll feel so happy that you'll thank the barbecue gods
above for good ol' Dr. Hogly Wogly. Dinners range from $12.25 to
$20.50 and will feed three hungry people.</TE>

<TE>   8039 Beach Blvd., Buena Park</TE>
<TE>   (714) 220-5220</TE>
<TE>   The roller-coaster war in Southern California this summer won't be
decided by which is the biggest, longest, fastest or baddest. It's
going to be settled by which is open. Six Flags Magic Mountain's X,
which flips riders head over heels in high-tech spinning seats
mounted to the side of the coaster's track, officially opened in
January.</TE>
<TE>   But delays and frequent closures have plagued the ride. When X
does run, waits of up to five hours are not unheard of. But at least
some folks are riding X. Knott's Berry Farm's Xcelerator promises a
2.3-second, 0-to-82-mph launch uphill, followed by an immediate
200-foot drop. Xcelerator was slated to open in mid-May. But it
missed that deadline, and now a representative said Knott's hopes to
open the coaster "sometime in June."</TE>

<TE>   Day Trip to Mayberry</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Madre</TE>

<TE>   Lizzie's Trail Inn</TE>
<TE>   165 E. Mira Monta Ave.</TE>
<TE>   Mt. Wilson Trailhead</TE>
<TE>   189 E. Mira Monta Ave.</TE>
<TE>   Looking for a lovely time warp to fall into this summer? Grab
those comfortable shoes and head to the little town of Sierra Madre
at the foothills of the Sierra Madre mountain range, just 18 miles
northeast of downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   This is a slow-paced version of Mayberry, with wide boulevards,
tree-lined sidewalks, two huge municipal parks and a handful of
outdoor cafes and restaurants that all love your pooch. There's a
small monument at the trailhead of Mt. Wilson that harks back to
1864, when burros were bringing telescope parts up to the first
observatory on the mountain. Next door, the tiny Lizzie's Trail Inn,
built in 1890, tells the tale of a lunch stand that became a
speak-easy during Prohibition. Admission is free, and the inn is open
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturdays.</TE>
<TE>   Another blast from the past is Beantown, the local coffee shop on
Baldwin Avenue, the main drag. Beantown sells great java, big
pastries and ice cream made the old-fashioned way, with sugar and
cream.</TE>

<TE>   Cafe Melisse</TE>
<TE>   24300 Town Center Drive, Valencia</TE>
<TE>   (661) 255-2233</TE>
<TE>   Josiah Citron brings his divine fare to Cafe Melisse in the heart
of Valencia. This casual bistro serves French classics such as moules
marinieres (steamed mussels), salad Lyonnaise (curly endive with
smoked bacon and a soft-boiled egg on top) and Entrecote frites (rib
eye with French fries). The glorious digs, decorated in mosaic tile
and horseshoe booths, include an endless marble-top bar at which you
can sip wine from the extensive list, and an outdoor dining area with
a crackling fire.</TE>

<TE>   That Other Bowl</TE>
<TE>   Starlight Bowl</TE>
<TE>   1249 Lockheed View Drive,</TE>
<TE>   Burbank</TE>
<TE>   (818) 525-3721</TE>
<TE>   www.starlightbowl.com</TE>
<TE>   The Starlight Bowl is a scaled-down version of the Hollywood Bowl
with a small-town vibe to match. Tucked into the hills, above an old,
tree-lined residential area, it draws a mix of Burbankians looking
for squeaky-clean entertainment and hipsters on the hunt for cheesy
good fun. The season starts July 4 with a genuine patriotic spectacle
dubbed "Proud to Be an American." Every Sunday night, bands play for
a few hours around sunset; sidewalks roll up by 9. Among the lineup
this year: Blood, Sweat and Tears, the Fab Four tribute band and
perennials Captain Cardiac and the Coronaries. You can buy a picnic
dinner or bring your own.</TE>

<LD>   Bus Stop--For about 20 minutes, William Inge's "Bus Stop" can fool
you into thinking it's a cozy little slice of down-home Americana, a
Norman Rockwell tableaux vivant with a willfully naive worldview. But
somewhere midway through Act 1, this underperformed Corn Belt classic
shifts into darker and chillier terrain. Written in 1954, but
spiritually closer to the Great Depression, "Bus Stop" is the
theatrical answer to Edward Hopper's "Nighthawks," a primal American
scene raised to mythopoeic levels and transposed from the anonymous
city to the anonymous Midwestern heartland, where no one is ever more
than a degree or two of separation from crippling, terminal
loneliness.Director Sabin Epstein's faithful and tenderly nuanced
production benefits from a core of note-perfect performances by the
ensemble, including Ben Messmer as a love-sick cowboy, Abby Craden as
his nightclub chanteuse love-object and, especially, Mark Bramhall's
crusty old Virgil, the cowboy's spiritual mentor and father
surrogate.</LD>

<LD>L eave the lemonade to the kids. When the summer heat hits, these
custom cocktails will cool you off much faster.</LD>
<LD>   Call it a grown-up Slurpee: The Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel in
Pasadena has put a new spin on the martini, offering a frozen version
at its Terrace Restaurant. It comes out of the blender mixed with
ice, like a frozen margarita. Request a basic version or opt for one
of the Ritz's exotic variations, including Key lime pie.</LD>
<LD>   Behind the bar at Spago Beverly Hills rests a special bottle of
Ketel One holding four cups of rare Persian mulberries (available
only from midsummer to mid-fall) in addition to the smooth Swedish
vodka. Request the Persian mulberry martini, and the bartender will
mix three parts of the rich purple liquid with a dash of Chambord (a
French raspberry liqueur) and one part Champagne, garnished with a
single vodka-infused berry.</LD>
<TE>   In Spain, hot nights call for cooling Sangria, and Asia de Cuba
offers it three ways: with Spanish blanco (white), rojo (red) or
sparkling wine. The bartender will pour your selection over a mix of
mango, papaya, watermelon, cantaloupe and other fruits soaking in
brandy, triple sec and simple syrup, and top it off with a splash of
pineapple and orange juice.</TE>
<TE>   "Cool as a cucumber" takes on new meaning at Mako, where the
eponymous chef-owner serves sake in hand-carved, chilled cucumber
cups. This infuses the sake with the vegetable's crisp flavors, so it
pairs well with dishes like crispy calamari salad or tuna carpaccio.</TE>

<HD>To Foragers, the Hunt Is a Thrill, --and the Price Is Right</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Leslie Gornstein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How many times have we heard that California is so bountiful that you
can reach out your window and pluck your meal from a tree?</LD>
<LD>   Being poor and jobless, and having watched the price of lettuce
skyrocket, I've determined it's time to do some plucking. Foraging is
actually quite the underground tradition in Los Angeles, but it isn't
always for the weak.</LD>
<LD>   There's the danger of addiction--to the jolt of adrenaline that
comes with recognizing that, say, the tree on the public easement on
Curson Avenue just north of Beverly Boulevard is a fig, and that
suckers are paying for the fruit at the Farmers Market practically
across the street.</LD>
<TE>   "It is the sheer delight of finding that rogue tomato plant in a
field," said Jean Dickinson, a Beverly Hills forager who admits to
jumping over fences for a gander at free fruit. "I don't advocate
taking anything that doesn't belong to you ... but there are delights
you can find when you are hiking."</TE>
<TE>   Tomatoes do grow like weeds here, literally. There's a yellow
teardrop variety sprouting out of the parking lot wall at 20/20 Video
in the Fairfax district. The seeds are so hardy that you can soak
them in a cocktail of battery acid and uranium and they'll still
sprout on your windowsill. Dickinson also reports a rock wall full of
peas near the Beverly Hills Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Chances are, that stuff that looks like pine needles, growing out
of countless planters or landscaped areas, is the same rosemary
that's sold at the supermarket. Ask the owners for permission before
you pluck, lest you peeve people like Jennifer Gordon, a spokeswoman
for the new mall the Grove. "We've planted [the rosemary] for
people's enjoyment," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, that's probably wild fennel growing out of the noise
abatement wall on the northbound 405 at the 91. But don't pick stuff
that's been soaking up car exhaust. Try the fennel along Runyon
Canyon park instead. (Be sure the flowers are yellow and the leaves
give off a licorice scent; otherwise you've got poison hemlock.)</TE>
<TE>   Even during this dry season, Griffith Park is bursting with
mustard greens, which have about the same kick as late
arugula--without the $9-a-pound price tag.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Knowledgeable foragers are eager to help. Start with the L.A.
Mycological Society (www.nhm .org/lams) or the local message board at
www.chowhound.com.</TE>

<LD>A landscape of concrete and high-rises. Sun hits the scorching glass
office towers, refracting into rainbows of heat. Los Angeles becomes
sleek and sultry--a torch singer riffing on 98 degrees.</LD>
<LD>   On the way to July, the pace in L.A. turns languid. For a few
weeks over in Tinseltown each summer, even Sammy stops running.</LD>
<LD>   Sunglasses move from option to essential, even on those days when
el sol won't deign crawl out from behind a marine layer dense with
its own set of issues.</LD>
<TE>   Talk radio seems more tedious, public radio feels too earnest.
Music--particularly live music--of any sort, sounds terrific.</TE>
<TE>   Casual Fridays spill over into Mondays. Vacation countdowns begin
in earnest. Air-conditioned indoor tables suddenly overtake the patio
ones in popularity at the Ivy. Yet the lines at Pink's hot dog stand
grows in defiance of the weather. Lunches last longer or migrate to
someplace else entirely, like Santa Barbara. Even Shakespeare heads
for the park.</TE>
<TE>   But this city has heart. And it's forever surprising, even when
you think summer's getting stale. Maybe that's why so many who move
here for a while stay forever. This summer, you can watch art emerge
as one of L.A.'s elementary schools has a brush with a mural veteran.
Try fencing with friends, or take a few hours at one of the downtown
spas to shake the doldrums. Sample one of the cool concoctions local
bartenders have whipped up. Or slip into one of the old movie houses
and see what preservation makes possible. And that's just the tip of
a fast-melting iceberg.</TE>

<LD>Odds are you're not familiar with Brent Spears, but you might know
his work. The lavish exteriors of Hollywood staples Wacko! and the
Soap Plant? He painted those. He's also responsible for the interior
of the first five House of Blues club interiors, as well as 60 murals
(painted with audience members) in 34 U.S. cities and 26 sites
throughout Europe and Australia as part of Vans' Warped Tour.</LD>
<LD>   But his most inspired gifts are found throughout Los Angeles.
Under the Love Los Angeles Mural Project, which he began in 1995,
Spears has emblazoned schools, neighborhoods and freeway underpasses
throughout L.A. With no predetermined sketches, he's created 45
large, vibrant murals, most with the assistance of inner-city
students. "I've always had a problem with schools being painted
beige," says the tattooed 37-year-old, laughing. He specializes in
projects of both the legal and guerrilla natures. Putting one drop of
paint on city property normally requires permission from the Cultural
Affairs Department, but relationships forged with Operation
CleanSWEEP and school officials have allowed Spears a gracious amount
of artistic license.</LD>
<LD>   "All my life, I thought, nobody asked me if they could build all
this, all the concrete and freeways," Spears says. "So why should I
ask, if I want to paint it?"</LD>
<TE>   This summer, Spears, partner Shannon LaBaw and a small group of
painters will ornament every exterior of El Sereno's Huntington Drive
Elementary School--the first time an L.A. Unified school has
undergone such a transformation. They're trying to get the project
financial support but want the mural to go up, regardless. As Spears
says in his mission statement for the Love Los Angeles Mural Project:
"The medicine that opens hearts and minds and creates vision should
be available in large doses."</TE>

<LD>From "Little House on the Prairie" innocence to sexy ethnic chic,
you're sure to see the peasant look everywhere in the next few
months. Why not? A spring trend that's sure to rise with the
temperatures, it's a relaxed way to look and stay cool--especially
for women with less than bikini-ready bods.</LD>
<LD>   L.A. stores are literally bursting with variations. From $126
styles at Betsey Johnson boutiques to $40 renditions at Urban
Outfitters to $20 styles at chains like Wet Seal, there's a bevy of
billowy tops and dresses for every budget.</LD>
<LD>   Higher-end interpretations can be found at pricey shops such as
Fred Segal, where a colorfully stitched hippie-esque blouse with
gathered waist and sleeves by Marc Jacobs goes for $175. A more
intricate evening style with cutouts and beading by Chloe runs $400.</LD>
<TE>   But those of us who earn peasant-level wages can afford the
romantic frocks too. Nearly every rack at low-end trendy mall
emporium Forever 21 is filled with puffy sleeves, ruffles, drawstring
necks and floral prints in beat-the-heat fabrics such as gauzy thin
cotton. A top nearly identical to the $175 Marc Jacobs one cost
$16.99.</TE>
<TE>   For a more authentic style, head to Olvera Street, where
beautifully embroidered pieces can be found at stores such as
Olverita's Village and Artes Andinas for muy caliente prices: $20</TE>
<TE>   to $30.</TE>

<LD>For 20 years my most earnest wish was for straight hair, especially
during summer, when simply thinking about sea spray caused my curls
to explode. Nothing could contain the prodigious frizz, not
blow-drying, barrettes or baseball caps (a nice Bozo look, that).</LD>
<LD>   I'd already done hard time with chemical straighteners, which
reeked of sulfur and left my hair stiff as a saltine cracker. Then I
heard about a nonchemical process called Straight Perm. At Antakiya,
a salon in Koreatown, my hair was evaluated (Straight Perm is safe
for colored and highlighted hair) and then subjected to a three-hour,
$300 procedure (more for longer hair) that included the application
of several non-noxious liquids and a two-woman comb-out with
"ultraviolet-coated" flattening irons.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward my hair was allowed to dry naturally, and it was ...
straight, as in really straight. It was also soft, and it didn't
smell like egg salad.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike curly perms, which falter after a few months, straight
perms last until hair grows out, which means no hibernating from
humidity or forgoing swims all summer.</TE>

<LD>It's hot, you're feeling decadent and pale, and the beach seems like
too big a deal. All you want to do is lie by the pool. Problem is,
you don't have one. It's time for that little-known pastime of the
clued-in but pool-less: pool poaching.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles, after all, has more hotels than it knows what to do
with, and most of them boast beautiful outdoor pools, some with
breathtaking rooftop views, and most with alfresco bars and
restaurants. Yes, yes, they are there for guests. But do you really
think tourists and businesspeople come to Los Angeles to lie by the
pool all day? No way. There's Hollywood &amp; Highland to visit. There's
the Grove to view. On any given Saturday there are more vacant hotel
poolside chairs than parking spots at the Beverly Center. Order a
drink and then all you need is a bathing suit, a book and attitude.
Don't bring a towel, because most pools provide them and, besides,
part of the thrill of pool poaching is pretending you're a guest for
the afternoon. Dress in as little street clothing as possible, and
carry only the essentials.</LD>
<TE>   As for the best pools, well, really, any will do. The Sunset
Marquis, a favorite with the music industry, is always nice for
pretending you're a visiting rock star. Only trouble is, there are
lots of pale British guests who actually do log hours poolside to
prove to their friends and co-workers that they've been to L.A., so
it can get a bit crowded.</TE>
<TE>   If you want to swan into the Mondrian's SkyBar without worrying
about a pesky guest list, daytime visits to the pool are your best
shot. As impenetrable as the door can be at night, it's a breeze when
the sun is out. The Standard, just down the street, offers a hipper
and less intimidating vibe, only without the sarong-clad poolside
cocktail waitresses.</TE>
<TE>   The pool at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel was made famous by David
Hockney's watercolors, and there's no reason residents shouldn't
experience that bit of history just like the tourists. Smack in the
middle of sightseeing central, it's quite serene and worth the trip
for the walk through the impressive Art Deco lobby alone. The
disappointment is that in 1995 they repainted the pool, owing to a
city ordinance prohibiting black-bottomed pools, so you really have
to strain your eyes to see any reminders of Hockney's famous
swooshes.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the Hotel Figueroa works when you're stuck downtown but
you want to feel like you've left the city. With its impressive
Mexican-meets-Moroccan style and largely undiscovered status, it's
the perfect place for downtown workers to nip out for an hour of
lunchtime sunbathing.</TE>
<TE>   The one hotel where a drink or even a full meal won't rent you
space by the pool is the rooftop oasis at Le Montrose Suite Hotel in
West Hollywood. To tap into the serenity and magnificent city views
here, convince your next out-of-town guest to check in. Without a
guest, you'll need guts, dark glasses and the air of one who belongs,
but you'll also risk trespassing charges. Besides, there's still no
such thing as a free lunch ... or a free pool chair.</TE>

<TE>   (805) 480-9845</TE>
<TE>   After the past year's orgy of star-spangled banners, this summer
the empire strikes back. Britain will be en fete next month for Queen
Elizabeth's Golden Jubilee, which marks her 50 years on the throne.
For the thousands of Brits in Southern California who don't want to
be left out, plus any indigenous Anglophiles and royalists, the
Queen's Golden Jubilee Ball will provide the most glamorous way of
celebrating. Such luminaries as Dame Julie Andrews, Sir Sean Connery
and Sir Anthony Hopkins are expected to attend along with 600 other
loyalists. With a full Welsh choir on hand, a Scottish pipe band,
florid toasts and everybody decked out in their finest formal wear,
this will be a great chance to take a day's pass on the sun, sea and
surf, and experience the joys of a stiff collar and upper lip.</TE>

<TE>   www.newschoolofcooking.com</TE>
<TE>   Want to travel this summer? How about a four-week tour of Italy,
followed by a one-day swing through Vietnam and supper in the
American South? If so, jet over to New School of Cooking, a bright,
busy kitchen and site of a cornucopia of culinary excursions, from
20-week professional series to single classes, many geared toward
summer appetites: marinades, barbecues and dry rubs; a cavalcade of
cupcakes; summer pies (fresh peach pie, fig galette, blackberry pie,
coconut cream pie, brown-sugar lemon meringue pie); and the corn
kitchen. One-day courses are usually three hours long, less than $100
and hands-on. (You will cook. You will eat.) Those interested in the
basics can home in on cheeses, wines, breads and something called
Essential Knife Skills, so you'll never again humiliate yourself or
the roast chicken.</TE>

<TE>   8825 National Blvd., Culver City</TE>
<TE>   (310) 559-4770</TE>
<TE>   To chill both inside and out, head to Surfas, a gourmet food and
cooking emporium in a hangar in Culver City. Massive and
air-conditioned, with a nice and knowledgeable staff that won't look
at you funny if you spend an hour cruising the aisles, Surfas is the
place to find cold pink limonata from Italy, cool sweet butter from
France, frozen shellfish, ice cream makers, highball glasses and
several thousand other items to whet the appetite. Fair prices, with
none of the froufrou fussiness associated with some foodie shops.</TE>

<TE>   parks.co.la.ca.us/virginia_gar dens.html</TE>
<TE>   Harry and Virginia Robinson's 6,000-square-foot home, tucked
behind the Beverly Hills Hotel, is impressive, but not nearly as
impressive as the 6.2-acre grounds, which feature a sparkling pool,
his-and-hers tennis courts, and enough flora to make Martha Stewart
apoplectic. Clearly the department store business was good to this
family, which deeded the estate to the county in the 1980s. At one
point the Robinsons employed 12 full-time gardeners to tend the
multiple rose gardens, Italian terrace garden and dense jungle of
Australian king palms--the largest collection outside Australia.
Tours ($10, adults; $3, children) are offered Tuesdays through
Fridays by reservation only. Hats and sunscreen suggested.</TE>

<TE>   928 S. Western Ave., L.A.</TE>
<TE>   (213) 382-1234</TE>
<TE>   With neither a Gap nor a Pottery Barn in sight, Koreatown Plaza's
80-plus shops on Western Avenue offer shoppers international style:
Trendii for fashions, Koreatown Video, Nicole's Coffee for espresso,
and European names (Stefanel, Benetton). This gleaming three-level
institution also holds surprises, including an unusual Tupperware
store, the boutique Dalki, and Strawberry, Korea's cheeky answer to
Hello Kitty. The International Food Court's bibimbap (sizzling stone
rice bowl) at the Gamja Bawi stand will win over foodies from the
east and west sides of L.A. Why have a hot dog on a stick when you
can dine on Vietnamese pho, Japanese sushi, hot tofu, Korean
barbecue, Chinese dumplings and the offerings of a restaurant devoted
to mushrooms? The Plaza makes the Grove look like, well ... just a
mall.</TE>

<TE>   Before there was Jamba Juice, there was the Juice Fountain on Vine
Street. Here, they squeeze, chop, blend and strain every imaginable
fruit and vegetable, and serve it up in the blender pitcher, with a
cup on the side, for $3 to $4. The wildly exotic combinations will
make you weep, they're so delicious. Order up the slightly tart,
violet-colored Blackberry Cream with blackberries, pineapple, honey
and rich whole yogurt, or the Fruit Rainbow, a virtual blended bowl
of fruit. If you're daring, choose the thick Athlete's Special, a mix
of milk, dates, raw cashews, fruit and a dash of protein powder. If
you arrive early enough, grab a chunk of the warm, moist carrot cake,
with its golden caramelized crust, for $1.75.</TE>

<TE>   www.toltecyoga.com</TE>
<TE>   Who would have thought that yoga, a 5,000-year-old discipline,
would be all the rage in the 21st century? At Urban Yoga Workout, a
combination of hatha yoga and Toltec teachings, Barbara Simon brings
more than two decades of experience to her classes. "I believe the
body, the mind and the spirit are avenues of exploration that can be
enhanced through the yoga experience," Simon says. The urban part of
the exercise includes push-ups and sit-ups. But what makes it urbane
is the setting. Classes are held at Michael Kohn Gallery, allowing
pupils to gaze at wonderful art while holding that cobra pose.</TE>

<TE>   Westside Fencing Center</TE>
<TE>   8737 Washington Blvd., Culver City</TE>
<TE>   (310) 204-2688</TE>
<TE>   Whether you're preparing for your next swashbuckling movie role or
trying to firm up those shoulders, the Westside Fencing Center may
provide the most interesting StairMaster alternative since Tae-Bo.
The largest fencing club on the West Coast, it is run by Roberta
Brown and teaches the art of the lunge, parry and retreat to 50 to
150 people of all ages each day. Everybody gets a free introductory
lesson. Using your foil, epee or saber makes for a great workout,
but, Brown says, the secret is in leaving the boredom of the gym
treadmill behind. "When you're fencing," she says, "you're using your
brain, and you don't realize quite how much you're using your body."
And, of course, the garb is so cool.</TE>

<TE>   337 E. 1st St., Little Tokyo</TE>
<TE>   (213) 626-9132</TE>
<TE>   Dig your chopsticks into this mass of cool, flavorful noodles, dip
them into the sake-spiked broth, inhale the delicate aroma, then
slurp it up ... the perfect summer noodle dish. Owner Kenji Suzuki,
who gets his authentic buckwheat soba from a distributor in San
Diego, serves it three ways. The simple zaru soba comes in a bamboo
strainer with a dollop of wasabi and green onions along with a tangy
dipping sauce. Ten zaru is identical, but with a side of tempura
shrimp and vegetables. Finally, his most popular dish, oroshi soba,
comes in a large bowl, the noodles already in the sauce, garnished
with green onions, wasabi, dried seaweed and pieces of crisp,
brilliant yellow tempura batter.</TE>

<TE>   July 11-22, various venues</TE>
<TE>   (213) 480-7088 or</TE>
<TE>   www.outfest.org</TE>
<TE>   "We met at Outfest" is a line you hear with regularity from gay
couples, and it's hardly surprising. The social scene surrounding
this huge, internationally important film festival is rightly
legendary. (It beats standing around in a bar any day.) This year,
for its 20th anniversary, Outfest is pulling out the stops. More than
40,000 people are expected to attend the 200-plus screenings of gay-
and lesbian-themed films from 24 countries. Although the schedule is
still to be finalized, the opening-night gala is "An Evening of Love,
Sex and Romance" in celebration of gay filmdom. One of the festival's
highlights is a special slate of Middle Eastern and Arab films. Not
one for Saddam.</TE>

<TE>   5911 1/2 Franklin Ave., Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   (323) 957-7965</TE>
<TE>   Since its opening last September, the Harmony Gallery has managed
to showcase an impressive array of underground superstars such as
outlaw writer Jerry Stahl, punk-rock diva Lydia Lunch and Warhol
Factory alum Mary Woronov. "We wanted to create a space that would
provide readings, music and art," explains curator Dave Jones, "and
the hope is to use the gallery to expose not just established people,
but young and emerging artists as well." Run by Susan and John
Polifornio, the same folks who own neighboring Counterpoint Books,
the Harmony promises to offer another refreshing slice of
counterculture to the parade of Beachwood Canyon-area beautiful
people.</TE>

<TE>   www.blitzstein.com</TE>
<TE>   Across from Canter's Deli and just south of oh-so-hip Largo lies a
one-of-a-kind curiosity--the Blitzstein Museum of Art. Inside, live
grotesque, gleeful characters are juxtaposed with serene backgrounds.
Endearing, odd pencil sketches rest in unorganized crates on the
floor, and paintings of all sizes loom on the walls. Each piece on
display and for sale is born of Harry Blitzstein's imagination. His
work, though overtly macabre, always has humor bubbling underneath.
Everything is for sale, and prices range from $1 for prints and $10
for smaller original drawings to $30,000 for some paintings. The
museum is open nightly from twilight to midnight.</TE>

<TE>   In this movie-mad city, it's amazing that so many people remain
unaware of the 1920s and '30s movie palaces that line Broadway in
downtown L.A. Some of the best have been restored, most recently the
Orpheum, with its brilliant neon sign and grand Wurlitzer organ still
up and running. The Last Remaining Seats film series, which is now in
its 16th year, starts Wednesday and includes five films: "Pillow
Talk" on Wednesday and "From Here to Eternity" June 19 at the Los
Angeles Theater (so opulent it has to be seen to be believed); "Now
Voyager" June 5 and "Distinto Amanecer" June 26 at the Palace; and
"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" June 12 and "Girl Shy" July 3 at
the Orpheum. Abandon the multiplex and find out why your grandparents
are so nostalgic.</TE>

<TE>   Feel pampered without leaving the city. This boutique hotel in the
heart of downtown L.A. has a rooftop deck with commanding views; its
friendly, knowledgeable staff offers customized treatments in a
Zen-like setting. While the spa offers traditional massages--Swedish,
deep tissue, reflexology--those who desire more should opt for the
two-hour Ultimate Wrap. Your body is dry-brush exfoliated, doused in
herb-infused aromatic oils, then swaddled in warm linens. The wrap
includes a 30-minute head and foot massage and a full body massage.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The perfect place to unwind and regroup without the frills and
fuss. Tokyo Shiatsu Massage doesn't have a wet steam but does offer a
deep finger massage that is coordinated to the points of command and
meridians of acupuncture. These slow, 65-minute massages awaken the
senses like nothing else. (Well, almost nothing else.) Dry saunas and
whirlpool tubs are available in the facility, which has seen the
likes of George Bush (senior) and Jean-Claude Van Damme over the
years.</TE>

<TE>   www.miyakoinn.com</TE>
<TE>   The spirit of Japan lives at the Miyako Inn spa in Little Tokyo.
Four fragrant whirlpool tubs contain mineral essences from major
Japanese hot springs, making for some divine dipping. After soaking,
nothing beats a Shiatsu massage, an ancient Japanese healing art
rooted in the philosophy and practice of traditional Chinese
medicine, in which the healing power of both practitioner and
receiver build upon each other to balance the vital life force known
as chi. Wet and dry saunas are also available, and green tea is
served in a soothing, floral-decorated lounge.</TE>

<HD>Hot Jazz and Hot Dogs: Spots to Keep Things Smiley</HD>

<LD>Like the rest of his year, Tavis Smiley's summers are busy. In
addition to hosting the L.A.-based NPR public affairs program "The
Tavis Smiley Show," which will soon be heard locally on KPCC-FM
(89.3), he's a writer, reporter and commentator for CNN and ABC News.
So when it comes time to unwind in the summer, he starts close to his
offices, in Leimert Park:</LD>
<LD>   Lucy Florence Coffee House: It's a great place right in Leimert
Park, which is ... in a sort of renaissance phase. Weeknights, when
I'm working late, I can walk a few blocks down the street from my
office, hear great jazz. They also have comedy several nights a week,
so depending on your mood you can get some jazz and be very chilled
out, or walk across the hallway and get your laugh on.</LD>
<LD>   Earle's Grill: The best hot dogs in the city can be found at
Earle's, right on Crenshaw. They're grilled, not boiled. It's run by
a couple of folks from New York, though they've been here for many
years. But they do it the old-fashioned grilled way.</LD>
<TE>   Magic Johnson Theatres: Most theaters don't look to serve a
particular cultural group. But at Magic Johnson Theatres, you can see
any big release, and they also reserve a couple of screens for
smaller films--sometimes documentaries--that have a cultural
relevance and that are important to people of color. Whether it's a
big blockbuster or a smaller budget film, I appreciate not having to
drive miles. It's right in the middle of the 'hood--with all the
amenities.</TE>
<TE>   Marina del Rey: There's a place in the marina where you can park
your car or bicycle and watch the boats come in and out of the
marina. When I want to relax and veg, I can pull my car up right up
to edge of the water, put money in the meter and totally relax. Then
in the distance you can see the planes taking off. If you watch, you
can count it, about every two minutes you see a plane taking off.</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin Hills Public Library: We have a brand-new,
state-of-the-art library that just opened here. It's not too often
the community gets a chance to welcome this kind of facility. It's
phenomenal--great research tools for anyone trying to improve their
lot in life.</TE>

<LD>New this week: "Lantana" looks as if it's going to be a thriller
concerned with the identity of the corpse and how it got there. But
what makes this film striking is that it is something unexpectedly
different as well. For just as much as it is a police procedural
replete with clues, evidence and suspects, it's also a thoughtful,
complex psychological investigation into the nature and difficulties
of marriages, particularly those in trouble. The film focuses on four
couples and, with a cast top-lined by Anthony LaPaglia, Geoffrey Rush
and Barbara Hershey, it doesn't lack the intensity and emotion to
make its story convincing. Written by Andrew Bovell, based on his
play "Speaking in Tongues," and directed by Ray Lawrence.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The bright hues of the AquaLink water taxi make a colorful
alternative for tourists eager to see what Long Beach has to offer.</LD>
<LD>   Every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, the red, yellow and purple
catamaran makes leisurely, 90-minute round trips among three top
tourism spots. For a mere dollar, a passenger can catch the AquaLink
at the Alamitos Bay Landing, just steps from the man-made canals of
the Naples area, and ride to downtown.</LD>
<LD>   The 60-foot catamaran will drop you off at the Queen Mary or the
Aquarium of the Pacific. Kids age 2 and younger ride free.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, the catamaran runs the other way, too. After riding
from downtown to the bay, hop a red Passport shuttle if you're in the
mood for one of the restaurants along 2nd Street in Belmont Shore.</TE>
<TE>   The AquaLink seats up to 75 people, but if your entourage is
bigger than that, you can split up and direct some of the posse to
the shiny red AquaBus, which can seat 49. That water taxi makes five
stops, including Pine Avenue Circle and Shoreline Village.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<LD>Inspired some 10 years ago by the films shown outdoors in New York
City's Bryant Park, and having subsequently visited similar venues
across the country, longtime friends Amanda Jones and Darren Held are
finally making their dream come true right at home in Long Beach. For
five Fridays in a row starting Aug. 16, they'll be turning Marina
Green Park into a screening room, projecting films digitally on a
22-by-30-foot screen. Stressing the community-based nature of their
idea, Held says they're using this inaugural run to feel out what
plays best and what people will turn out for--so they are showing a
gamut of films, from newer family-friendly fare like "Shrek" to
timeless classics like "Casablanca" and "The Wizard of Oz" to the
however-you'd-care-to-classify-it "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged
Me." They're even promising some pre-movie live entertainment;
opening for "Pearl Harbor" will be a National Guard exhibition. So
plan to spread your blanket, bring an evening's worth of snacks and
enjoy.</LD>

<LD>A sportfishing boat is a man's world: The comforts are minimal, the
company is rough, and the bacon cheeseburgers are grand. Understand
that women aren't unwelcome; they just don't often care to go twice.
But even if you only go once, there's nothing quite like a deep-sea
fishing trip to bring an overstressed urban family closer together.
And aren't rites of passage supposed to be somewhat grueling?</LD>
<LD>   For all the sport's authenticity and none of the attitude, there's
no place quite like Capt. Hook's Sportfishing in Channel Islands
Harbor. Capt. Hook himself, owner Kenneth Kohr, didn't lose his hand
to a sea creature (it was an electrical accident), but when he and
his wife, Debra, opened shop five years ago, finding a name was easy.
"We even had a guy working for us who had recently lost an eye," Kohr
says with a chuckle, "so he had the patch, I had the hook, and we'd
hobble around the office scaring the customers. It was fun!"</LD>
<LD>   Despite the grisly elements, Capt. Hook's is a very friendly place
for women and children to dabble in male bonding rituals of the sea.
All summer long, mothers drop their kids off to spend the day fishing
at the bait dock. "It's cheap baby-sitting," Kohr says. But the real
experience can only be had by taking your boy (or girl) on an
overnight trip to the fishing grounds off the outer islands.</LD>
<TE>   The Pacific Dawn leaves at 10 p.m. The tables in the galley of the
60-foot boat are carpeted to keep cups and plates from sliding
around. Along with the maple syrup and Tapatio sauce, each table's
condiment rack holds a deck of cards and a set of poker chips. An urn
of coffee brews perpetually. Beer is in the cooler. Down below, the
main cabin is divvied into upper and lower double bunks for 24
fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, there's nothing like sleeping with one's head next to a pair
of 600-horsepower diesel engines to relax the overtaxed city dweller.
But neither is there anything quite like the smell of grilled onions
wafting over the deck of a quiet boat that's afloat on a dove-gray
ocean, 50 miles from the mainland, with dramatic island cliffs slowly
resolving into view out of the dawn mist. Before the sun is up, every
man (and the two women) on the boat has a line in the water. Steve,
the ship's cook, calls out your number when your magnificent
meat-and-potato-laden breakfast burrito is ready.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. John Shull, who was a high-powered salesman until a fit of
soul-searching led him to buy the Pacific Dawn 13 years ago, darts
among the amateur fishermen, baiting hooks, untangling snarled lines
and giving succinct but effective fishing lessons. By the time the
boat heads for home at 2 p.m., the catch includes 140 rockfish,
several ling cod--their bodies a startling bright blue--and a few
small brown fish that Capt. Shull calls "chuckleheads."</TE>
<TE>   But the highlight of the trip is when your cold, tired, cranky
10-year-old son finally gets a fish hooked. Capt. Shull races to his
side and exhorts him to "Bring it up! Keep reeling! Breathe through
your ears!" And the jaded city boy finally cracks a smile.</TE>

<LD>Whether it's work or play, you'll find Jeff Garlin at the beach. You
can't tell, he says, but HBO's "Curb Your Enthusiasm"--on which he's
an actor and executive producer--is shooting on recycled sets from
"Baywatch." They could have had the costumes, too. We can all thank
higher powers that the show's creator, Larry David, nixed that idea.
We asked Garlin for his ideas about how to make the most of the sand
and surf. He came back with a list of beachgoing essentials:</LD>
<LD>   1</LD>
<LD>   A lox platter</LD>
<TE>   Whether you're hungry or just want a fun treat, nothing beats a
lox platter. My No. 1 fantasy is to be surrounded by bikini-clad
beauties all having poppy seed bagels, a schmear of cream cheese and
a few slices of Nova. All of which brings me to...</TE>
<TE>   2</TE>
<TE>   Nipsey Russell</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Nipsey Russell. If there's one thing bikini-clad chicks dig,
it's Nipsey. Let's face it, I'm not always funny. Really. It's true.
See, that's where Nipsey comes in. A few minutes with Nipsey, and the
gals are laughin' and jumpin'. I don't know why they jump, but they
do. Thank you, Mr. Russell!</TE>
<TE>   3</TE>
<TE>   The nickname "Moondoggie"</TE>
<TE>   Do I really have to explain?</TE>
<TE>   4</TE>
<TE>   Invisible Spray</TE>
<TE>   I need it so as not to call attention to myself. I'm very popular
with the young people. Also, it adds fun and high jinks to the bikini
mamas.</TE>

<HD>Chariots of the Gods Exert a Heavenly Pull</HD>

<LD>Loads of people probably see God down on Venice Beach every day, but
once a year it's a community event. The International Society for
Krishna Consciousness Rukmini Dwarakadish Temple has been putting on
its Ratha Yatra festival at Venice Beach since 1977, and this year's
26th annual promises to be the biggest rolling party and feast yet.
The "Festival of Chariots" (Ratha Yatra) begins at 11 a.m. just south
of the Santa Monica Pier. There, Krishna devotees shoulder huge ropes
to pull three ornate two-story carts through the streets, each
ferrying one of the temple's three deities: Lord Krishna as Lord
Jagannatha, the Lord of the Universe; his brother Lord Baladeva; and
his sister Lady Subhadra. This festival has been going on for
thousands of years in the southeast Indian coastal town of Jagannatha
Puri, where the carts are tugged by up to 1 million frenzied
worshipers.</LD>
<LD>   The L.A. version involves somewhat fewer devotees but builds to a
crowd of about 50,000 by the time the swirl of ecstatic music,
dancers and pullers chanting the thousand names of God rolls up at
Venice Beach. Once there, attention shifts to a small village of
tents housing Krishna historical exhibits, live bands and dancers,
and a seven-course vegetarian meal.</LD>
<TE>   It's no cheap affair to mount--this year's festival will cost
about $150,000--but in the fine Krishna tradition, for anyone
attending it's free. "The Lord Jagannatha comes out once a year, and
he wants to see his people," says temple organizer Nirantara Dasa.
"You can experience the heavenly realm just by pulling the cart and
viewing God. Christians, Jews, Muslims, whatever, you come and pull
the cart. We're a universal, open movement. We accept anybody."</TE>

<LD>Even on the hottest day of the year, Southern California offers an
endless expanse of cool ocean water to slip into and under. A
blue-green escape from the real world lapping miles of sand. There
for anyone. Free for the taking.</LD>
<LD>   We do love our beaches. Enough of us pack up cars, coolers,
friends and family on summer weekends and head toward the water that
the freeways clog, beach parking lots fill, tempers flare, and the
Pacific Coast Highway settles a few inches just to accommodate the
weight of all those SUVs.</LD>
<LD>   The beach holds such promise of a day well spent that most of us
forget there's more to do than secure a plot of sand, a cache of food
and drink, and enough sunscreen--SPF 15, please--for everybody.</LD>
<TE>   So do the beach thing, indulge, swim, surf and burn. We won't
bother you with the obvious. When it comes to Boogie boards,
Rollerblades, bikes and bikinis, you're on your own.</TE>
<TE>   But when you're in the mood for something else, consider the
possibilities: Take an hour or so and drift across the water on a
bright purple water taxi for the grand price of $1. Drop in on a
surfboard swap meet packed with vintage surfers and boards. Tow the
rope and enjoy the meal at the annual Hindu/Krishna parade. Check out
a really big screen at an outdoor film festival. See what 20 bucks
and a little patience will buy you at an all-you-can-eat beach
barbecue.</TE>
<TE>   Don't just spend a day at the beach. Explore its outer edges.
There are more than a few fringe benefits to be found.</TE>

<TE>   The Venice Psychic</TE>
<TE>   1101 Ocean Front Walk</TE>
<TE>   Amid all the wacky street performers, greasy food, cheap
sunglasses and half-naked Rollerbladers in Venice Beach may lie the
key to your future ... or at least your summer. The area is packed
with fortunetellers, Tarot readers, palm readers, handwriting
analysts and even people who can tell if there is "good or evil
around you" from your facial structure. Each promises all the answers
for 10 to 20 bucks. But who's the best? The old guy in the sailor hat
with a tattered Tarot deck or the robust-looking Gypsy with the
crystal ball?</TE>
<TE>   "It's about finding someone you're comfortable with," says the
waterfront fave who calls herself the "Venice Psychic." Unlike most
readers, who come in from all over and set up tables, V.P. lives
right off the walkway and offers guidance in her beachfront home. At
just $5 for a shockingly accurate quickie palm reading, she's the
best bargain on the boardwalk.</TE>

<TE>   (310) 541-7613</TE>
<TE>   The Palos Verdes Peninsula was one of the Channel Islands about 10
million years ago, and "the hill" is still famously remote. Get in
touch with its spectacular wild coastal sage scrub habitat by taking
a moderate hike on the Forrestal Property, a 160-acre parcel
preserved by the Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy. Old
quarries expose the fascinating geology above the coastal area of
Portuguese Bend, site of the largest and oldest active landslide in
the continental U.S. It's not uncommon at Forrestal to find sharks'
teeth and other seabed fossils, as well as wildflowers like mariposa
lilies and California bush sunflower. Oh yeah, and rattlesnakes. Call
the conservancy for docent tours. Hikers with kids may also want to
check out the George F. Canyon Nature Center on the way, (310)

<TE>   Hankering for that rustic campfire experience but don't care for
the tent and outhouse portions of the program? Then check out the
monthly Restaurant Night at this 102-acre ranch in the outer reaches
of Malibu. The $21.95 price tag ($15.95 for children under 13)
includes all-you-can-eat barbecue, optional tractor-pulled hayride
and, if there's enough interest on a given night, line dancing. The
'cue itself is decent enough. It wouldn't win any awards, but there's
something satisfying about eating messy ribs at a picnic table under
an oak tree. Must be the inner cowboy. Alas, no s'mores.</TE>

<TE>   (310) 393-2788</TE>
<TE>   Cool, refreshing and guilt-free, these homemade Italian ices will
quench your thirst while satisfying your aching sweet tooth. You
amble down trendy Montana Avenue as you crunch on one of their
sublime seasonal flavors, including peach, cantaloupe, honeydew,
mango and strawberry, or, for the purists, deep, rich chocolate and
clean, fresh vanilla. This water-based treat is so hydrating that
folks fill their thermal containers with Dido's ices before hitting
the beach. If you're longing for something a little more decadent,
try the strawberry with a dollop of frozen vanilla yogurt on top.
Water may be free, but an ice will cost $2 to $4, or $7 for a quart.</TE>

9. Reservoirs of beer and water are available to douse the flames,
but outside drinks aren't permitted. Adding to the heat, live rock,
blues, reggae and acid jazz could prove as spicy as the food. Acts
include Soul Asylum, Booker T. &amp; the MG's, Bob Mould, the Mother Hips
and Black Uhuru's Don Carlos. Tickets are available through the
cook-off Web site and at several Long Beach-area businesses.</TE>

<LD>A loha means hello and good buys--well, if $3,200 isn't too much to
pay for a 1940s balsa wood longboard in rough shape. This fourth
annual swap meet hosted by Cruz in Hermosa Beach is a must-attend
event for anyone who surfs or loves surfing's Hawaiian roots. The
more than 50 dealers on hand have not only collected hundreds of
boards to break your bank and your heart (a standout from last year:
a 1970s Gerry Lopez Lightning Bolt single-fin shortboard, never mind
the dings), but also cover every micro-niche in Polynesia. You'll
find antique rattan furniture and tiki masks, jewelry, hula nodders
and ukuleles. Or albums by Cecilio and Kapono, Don Ho and Alfred
Apaka, perhaps a rare vinyl copy of the original soundtrack to the
epic surf film "Five Summer Stories" by country-rock band Honk. If
you want to get real modern, maybe you'll find an original Logan
Earth Ski skateboard or some Hang Ten gear. And yes, there will be
lots of Hawaiian shirts. You may find the odd board at other flea
markets or longboard-club events up and down the coast, but will they
dare to use the word "Hawaiiana"?</LD>

<LD>Ginza Sushi-Go? Masa Takayama, owner and sushi maof Ginza Sushi-Ko,
is considering leaving Beverly Hills. His small, reservation-only
restaurant is the most expensive in L.A. (and possibly the country),
with prices starting at $300 a head. Takayama has been at his Rodeo
Drive location for eight years. His reason for leaving? "I'd like to
try a new place," he tells us. "I like to try new things." The switch
won't happen until next spring when the new AOL/Time Warner building
in Manhattan he's moving into is finished. Thomas Keller of the
French Laundry, the Napa Valley's most celebrated restaurant, has
staked out space in the same building. And Manhattan chef
Jean-Georges Vongerichten (Jean Georges, Vong, Jo Jo) will install a
steakhouse there as well. Takayama might leave behind a small staff
to keep his Beverly Hills place open. "My young chefs might take
over," he says, "but I don't know yet."</LD>

<TE>   A Little Spinoff: Josiah Citrin, chef-owner of the high-end French
restaurant Melisse, has just opened a bistro version his Santa Monica
place in Valencia. "I feel really appreciated up here," he says of
the Santa Clarita Valley. Cafe Melisse seats about 300 in a main
dining room, private dining room, lounge and patio. The colors are
warm and subdued, as at Melisse, but the feeling is casual. A
separate take-out section will open in a few weeks. Mario Perez,
Citrin's sous chef for nine years (and four restaurants), will be
executive chef. Cafe Melisse is open for lunch and dinner daily.</TE>

<TE>   R.I.P.: After 17 years on 3rd Street in Los Angeles, Peppe Miele
closed L.A. Trattoria on Sunday. The lease was up for renewal and he
couldn't come to terms with his landlord. Miele still owns Antica
Pizzeria in the Villa Marina Marketplace, 13455 Maxella Ave., Marina
del Rey, however; L.A. Trattoria customers who need a Neopolitan fix
can call the Marina location at (310) 577-8182 and get free pizza
delivery for a month to help them weather the transition. Says Miele,
"I would like to thank our customers for such a loyal run."</TE>

<HD>How I Made Peace With That Glazed Feeling of Summer</HD>
<DH>Summer,</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY UPDIKE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Telling people you live in Los Angeles is like showing up at a party
with a hooker. People feel free to leer and ask inappropriate
questions: Isn't everyone there stupid? How can you stand all that
fakeness? Are your breasts real?</LD>
<LD>   Americans love to despise Los Angeles even more than they love to
despise New York, and I say this as a New Yorker. While the rest of
the world hates America for being shallow, juvenile and
self-indulgent, America turns to Los Angeles and hates it for those
same reasons. You could say that Los Angeles is the America of
America.</LD>
<LD>   Summer is at the heart of this irrational loathing. Not actual
summer, so much as the ethos of summer that L.A., supposedly,
represents. The logic goes something like this: Summer, in
moderation, is good. It's OK to read Jackie Collins and go to
non-Oscar-caliber movies in the summer. It's fine to start drinking
at 2 in the afternoon if it's a Saturday in summer and you're firing
up the barbecue. Go ahead and wear those short shorts, if it's June
and you've got the legs for them. Summer is meant to be as
lightweight and airy as a beach ball; God planned it that way to
reward us for suffering through winter.</LD>
<TE>   But then there's Los Angeles, the city that takes summer too far.
It's summer here all the time, as the rest of the country sees it,
and that seasonal imbalance has addled Angelenos' brains and thrown
our values out of whack. We think in blond. We can't help it. Does
anyone doubt that the reason Los Angeles is a godless place that
produces movies in which no one suffers real consequences for their
actions is because the people who live here have been deluded into
thinking that they can stay young and beautiful forever, and they
think that because they live in a city where it's always summer and
they never experience the rhythm of life where things die in winter
and are reborn in spring, and that's the problem with Los Angeles?</TE>
<TE>   All of that is true, of course, except the premise. There are
seasons in Los Angeles--mild ones, but they do exist. Summer is the
worst one. The first summer after I moved here, I spent two weeks in
July driving my 1984 Volvo with no air-conditioning around Los
Angeles looking for doughnut shops, doing a radio story about why
there are so many doughnut shops in L.A. I was panting from the heat.
I felt woozy.</TE>
<TE>   In between stops--King Donut, Jubilee Donut, Best Donut, Yum Yum
Donut, Mom's Donuts and Chinese Food to Go--I ranted to myself that
this was not what I signed up for when I moved to Los Angeles. This
was not temperate; this was almost as bad as summers in Chicago or
New York. Worse, in fact, because in other cities you can get places
in summer by walking or riding a bike but in L.A. you have to drive,
and the one place you don't want to be in summer is stuck in a car.</TE>
<TE>   But I didn't leave Los Angeles after that summer, even though I'd
planned on living here only six months--just long enough to be able
to make fun of it knowledgeably when I moved to New York. I got a car
with air-conditioning and settled in. I liked Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is, summer is lame everywhere. It's the most over-hyped
season of the year, not a vacation so much as the expectation of a
vacation, basically three months of New Year's Eves where the only
possible reason you wouldn't be enjoying yourself to the fullest is
that you're not thin enough, outdoorsy enough or drunk enough.</TE>
<TE>   The perpetrators of this myth of summer being the best time of
year are not, I would argue, Angelenos, but rather the residents of
other cities, where the rest of the year is so cold, damp and dark
that any glimpse of sunshine sends them scurrying to the beach and
dragging out the barbecue, whether they want to do those things or
not. Bathing suits are donned by people who clearly hate wearing
them. Volleyball is played by people who would rather be at a cafe
drinking iced coffee but who have convinced themselves that they will
never find love if they don't get some sand in their toes. Summer has
become one long, dreary exhortation to "Go for it!"</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is a good place to get over all that. It's not summer
here all the time, but it is sunny most of the year, and that luxury
gives us the chance to free ourselves from the tyranny of summer. Los
Angeles is where I finally faced summer, saw it for what it was--and
wasn't--and learned to enjoy it on my own terms, which are: I will
work every day during summer and not feel like a drone for doing so,
because I like my work and because I usually find it unpleasantly hot
during the day in summer. I will go running around the Silver Lake
reservoir at 7:30 p.m. and be glad that it's still light out, but I
will not expect myself to do this every night. I will invite friends
over for drinks or a barbecue in the backyard only as often as seems
fun and easy. I will encourage myself to go for a walk in the Angeles
National Forest one day because it's cool there even in summer and
the woods remind me of New England. I will not hide my eagerness to
wear my tiny, clingy-but-gauzy pink dress to any party I am invited
to. I will read inside all day on a sunny Saturday if that's what I
want to do, or go to a movie in the middle of the afternoon, or go
shopping if I can afford it.</TE>
<TE>   And if I spend every day for two weeks driving around to mini
strip-malls, finding out that a doughnut empire was created in
Southern California by Cambodians fleeing the Khmer Rouge, I will not
spend one second of that time believing I should be at the beach.</TE>

<LD>It's going to be a summer of seek and ye shall find for Southland
fans of jazz and world music in search of something beyond the tried
and true. Innovative major events are in short supply, in part
because of unimaginative programming at the Hollywood Bowl, and a
general paucity of jazz and world music bookings at venues such as
the Universal Amphitheatre and the Greek Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   This means that for anyone loath to revisit the same big-name
headliners--Tony Bennett? again?--it's going to take some effort. But
there's still plenty of fine music, often presented via
low-on-the-horizon programs offering new and fascinating talent.</LD>
<LD>   My favorite destination to explore those possibilities has always
been the California Plaza, where Grand Performances produces an
delectable menu of musical events each summer in one of the
Southland's most attractive settings. This year I'll be sitting by
the Watercourt to hear a pair of programs by a particularly
intriguing pair of female vocal artists: Ethiopian singer Gigi, whose
rhythmically underscored storytelling will be showcased on Aug. 10;
and Lizz Wright, a highly touted new gospel-tinged jazz
vocalist--just signed by Verve Records--who makes her Los Angeles
debut on July 19 and 20.</LD>
<TE>   Why is it that acts such as these surface so often at Grand
Performances instead of larger venues? In part, because larger venues
have to book acts that can draw sizable audiences. But the Bowl, the
Greek and other venues could use opening-act slots for more creative
bookings.</TE>
<TE>   To their credit, the Bowl's world music programmers have done
precisely that on a few programs, including the July 13 bill of R&amp;B
singer Lauryn Hill with South Africa's Mahotella Queens and
Portugal's brilliant fado artist Mariza. Brazilian star Monica
Salmaso with the legendary Gal Costa on Sept. 8 is likewise a smart
pairing. We'd all be better off if that sort of musical thinking
spread.</TE>

<HD>Don't Try to Pin Down the Stripes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Hilburn</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The White Stripes are the most exhilarating young rock band in
America, partially because it's so hard to pin down just what's so
great about them. The Detroit duo of Jack and Meg White have absorbed
50 years of blues, country and rock and have the audacity to make the
styles their own.</LD>
<LD>   In raving about "White Blood Cells," which the Whites dedicated to
country superstar Loretta Lynn, England's Q magazine described the
Stripes' sound as a "disoriented Led Zeppelin."</LD>
<LD>   The New Yorker has proclaimed, "The Stripes play the blues the way
bands like the Kinks and the Who played R&amp;B: loud and fast and out of
control."</LD>
<TE>   Led Zeppelin? the Kinks? the Who? Loretta Lynn?</TE>
<TE>   You can come up with 10 other combinations of artists and still
not be any closer to defining the heart of the music's explosive
creative impulses.</TE>
<TE>   On their 1999 self-titled album, the Detroit duo did a howlingly
intense version of Bob Dylan's "One More Cup of Coffee" that sounded
like something Screamin' Jay Hawkins recorded on the same night he
cut "I Put a Spell on You."</TE>
<TE>   In "White Blood Cells," the Whites employ elements of rockabilly
("Hotel Yorba") and power pop ("Fell in Love With the Girl") and
throw in melodies as gorgeous as Paul McCartney's ("We're Going to Be
Friends") and imagery as vivid and original as Kurt Cobain's ("Offend
in Every Way").</TE>
<TE>   When I saw the Stripes at the Troubadour last year, Jack White,
who sings and plays guitar, struck me as a cross between Johnny Cash
and the early Billy Corgan--someone with artistic integrity and
enough stubborn independence not to let the record company ever talk
him into compromises.</TE>
<TE>   What makes the Stripes shows around Southern California so
promising is that we're likely to walk away with different
descriptions of the Stripes' music after each one.</TE>

<HD>War in the Eyes of H.C. Westermann</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Knight</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Thanksgiving Day in 1980, as Nancy and Ronald Reagan were
preparing to take up residence in the White House, sculptor H.C.
Westermann wrote in a blunt letter to his sister, Martha, "How are we
going to cope with those two idiots?"</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't just a partisan rant from a disgruntled Democrat. Not
your garden variety bleeding heart, 58-year-old Westermann had served
with the Marines in the Pacific during World War II, had reenlisted
in 1950 to serve in Korea and had joined the reserves in 1952, while
he went to school to study sculpture at the Art Institute of Chicago.
(Martha had spent four years in the Women's Army Corps). That the
newly elected president and commander-in-chief was a hawkish
politician--one who fantasized in public about fighting valiantly
during World War II, although in fact he sat it out on a movie studio
back-lot--seemed grotesque. Westermann knew the meaning of authentic
sacrifice. He'd been aboard the USS Enterprise on May 14, 1945, when
a kamikaze--the first of a desperate series of Japanese suicide
planes--slammed into its stern, killing and maiming scores. And the
art Westermann had been making to great acclaim for 25 years often
dealt with the agony and absurdity of war.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, Westermann's art deals with the agony or absurdity of just
about everything involved in being alive. (He died in 1981.)
Beginning June 9, the Museum of Contemporary Art will host a
traveling retrospective of the L.A. native's unusual sculpture and
drawings at the Geffen Contemporary in Little Tokyo. It's the first
survey of its kind since New York's Whitney Museum of American Art
toured a retrospective in 1978 (the Los Angeles County Museum of Art
mounted one a decade before). Together with the concurrent Andy
Warhol retrospective (through Aug. 18) and the survey of Italian
sculpture, "Zero to Infinity: Arte Povera, 1962-1972" (through Sept.
22), it promises to be a remarkably rich summer at MOCA.</TE>

<HD>A  Path for Escape Between Softcover Pages</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MOON ZAPPA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I start to see packs of girls wearing open-toe platform shoes,
low-slung cutoffs and multihued bathing-suit tops swigging iced soy
chai lattes, I know summer has arrived. And with it, the annual
question is posed: Whatever shall I read while beached poolside?</LD>
<LD>   In case you are stumped in the months without Rs, I humbly offer a
few time-tested tips.</LD>
<LD>   First and foremost, if you are like me, summer equals escape,
which is precisely what I look for in my summer reads, fiction or
non-. Whether I budgeted well enough to enjoy my literary selections
overseas or in my own backyard, at the very least I want to feel that
I have traveled.</LD>
<TE>   I also tend to favor books about people whose existence is so
different from mine that when I die I won't feel I missed out on
anything life had to offer--because I didn't, because I lived a
thousand lives in books.</TE>
<TE>   As a rule, I do not believe in the hardcover between June and
August. I like them better on my bedside table, in winter, rather
than taking up valuable space in my suitcase, a spot far better
suited for a trinket purchased abroad. Generally, hardcovers stink of
complexity and grown-up stuff anyway, and they look dangerously
sophisticated next to a glossy magazine, also excellent for summer
reading. I am also no stranger to the dreaded self-help workbook.
What better way to make use of your bronzing time than armed with a
sparkly pen, an umbrella drink and a list of questions for and about
you?</TE>
<TE>   To avoid accusations of frivolousness, I suggest getting in at
least one classic, one bestseller and something more to brag about
other than your tan.</TE>
<TE>   So whether you are curling up underneath a cabana at a four-star
spa or in a pal's poorly constructed hammock, you really can't go
wrong in the reading department so long as you think "escape."</TE>
<TE>   That is why, this summer, if I am lucky, I will wake up in a fancy
hotel with amnesia and a suitcase full of money, befriend a child
with a giant's disorder, accept a job as a hit man on the sleazy Las
Vegas Strip, nurse my ailing husband back to health after a boat
injury to the head, wantonly judge others from my filthy one-room
apartment and get in touch with my inner goddess.</TE>

<LD>Two radically different concepts of ballet make mid-July something of
an artistic referendum. On July 11, American Ballet Theatre brings to
the Music Center its production of "Le Corsaire," a much revised 1868
Marius Petipa story ballet that the company performed in Costa Mesa
three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Eight days later, at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, the
contemporary Italian company Aterballetto introduces Southern
California to "A Midsummer Night's Dream," choreographed two years
ago by Mauro Bigonzetti to music by Elvis Costello.The Italians
obviously have novelty in their favor; the Americans boast an array
of international stars. But in the deepest sense, the engagements are
a lesson in contrast: one company that uses stars to animate fake
choreographic antiques; the other believes in ballet as a living art
form.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, ABT offers its New York audiences plenty of major
contemporary choreography. On local stages, however, it nearly always
retails some of the worst editions of 19th century classics seen
anywhere--most recently a stodgy "Nutcracker," a patchwork "Swan
Lake" and now, again, this irredeemably cheesy "Corsaire."</LD>
<TE>   Petipa, of course, is the fabled architect of Imperial Russian
style and Bigonzetti merely a 42-year-old working artist. But he's
not unknown on our stages: He was a featured choreographer on the
last Stuttgart Ballet visit two years ago, and Balletto di Toscana
danced his full-evening "Mediterranea" in 1998--in both cases at
OCPAC.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Bigonzetti can make us forget the masterpieces that George
Balanchine and Frederick Ashton developed from "A Midsummer Night's
Dream" can't be predicted, but the ballet is sure to be inimitably
his.</TE>
<TE>   So the key question remains: Should we expect the world's finest
dancers to prop up ever more dubious scavengings from the 19th
century or can classicism successfully serve new visions and new
audiences?</TE>

<LD>Two decrepit buildings in the vicinity of downtown L.A. that aren't
normally used for theater will play host to the most adventurous
theatrical events of the summer: a radical vision of "King Lear"
opening June 14, and Cornerstone Theater's "Crossings, journeys of
Catholic immigrants," opening June 22.</LD>
<LD>   For "King Lear," director Travis Preston and the CalArts Center
for New Theater will use six sites in a 30,000-square-foot former
power plant at the Brewery Complex, a few blocks northeast of
downtown. Audiences will move from space to space, past a 40-foot
video installation, a field of oil derricks, a suspended car wreck
and other scenic highlights.</LD>
<LD>   The cast is all-female, led by Fran Bennett, who has already
tackled men's roles in the smaller-scale productions of Los Angeles
Women's Shakespeare Company. Three distinguished East Coast
actresses--Joan MacIntosh, Mary Lou Rosato and Marissa Chibas--are
also featured in a company of 50 that's filled out with CalArts
students. Advance word from Preston is that this Lear is, more or
less, the play's bad guy.</LD>
<TE>   With only two weeks of performances and only 140 spectators per
night, tickets may be scarce. But "King Lear" also will be a
harbinger of similar events. The Center for New Theater will soon
inhabit REDCAT, CalArts' new theater that's scheduled to open at the
Walt Disney Hall complex in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Cornerstone Theater is an old hand at site-specific projects, and
this year's "Crossings" will use the partially demolished St.
Vibiana's Cathedral to explore biblical stories from the perspective
of L.A. Catholic immigrants from five ethnicities. An audience of 200
will make the rounds of the old church, watching a nucleus of
professional actors supplemented by people from the five communities.
The director is Steven Kent, whose Company and ProVisional theaters
in the late '60s and early '70s were the grooviest, most experimental
troupes in town.</TE>

<LD>What will it be like, Thomas Quasthoff's Hollywood Bowl debut, when
many in the audience will see him for probably the first time? On
stage, the German bass baritone makes a first impression unlike any
other singer.</LD>
<LD>   Because his mother took the drug Thalidomide, his limbs are not
fully developed. You can't help but notice that as he walks on stage
and climbs upon a platform. You won't forget it once he starts
singing, either, because you won't need to. That Quast- hoff is who
he is and that he is a great singer are not a coincidence. His voice
is large, full, dramatic and beautiful; it carries with remarkable
ease through a large concert hall. And his artistry is the sum total
of his experiences.</LD>
<LD>   To hear him sing a Schubert song is to enter into the depth of
each word and each sublime tone.</LD>
<TE>   To hear him sing lusty German opera arias (as he does on a new CD)
is to sense boisterous rebelliousness. To hear him probe Bach
cantatas, looking death in the face, is to understand human frailty
and the triumph of the spirit. To hear him sing his favorite encore,
"Ol' Man River," as I hope he will at the Hollywood Bowl, is to feel
the blues as if sung by a Delta original.</TE>
<TE>   At the boundless Bowl on Aug. 13, an amplified Quasthoff will have
a new handicap in that he will not be able to make it seem as if he
is singing to each of us individually. But he is a magnificent singer
who's prevailed over far worse obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   And he'll have plenty of help. The songs of Mahler's "Des Knaben
Wunderhorn" are full of humanity, wonder, theater. As for the
accompaniment, Esa-Pekka Salonen conducts the Los Angeles
Philharmonic in a program that previews the orchestra's late-summer
European tour, so it will surely be more thoroughly rehearsed than a
conventional Bowl concert.</TE>

<LD>* J.B. (Powerhouse Theatre, 3116 2nd St., Santa Monica, [866]
633-6246). This revival of Archibald MacLeish's 1959 Pulitzer
Prize-winning retelling of the Book of Job achieves considerable
impact courtesy of striking staging, an exuberant cast and inevitable
post-9/11 relevance, all of which offset the plummy excesses of the
free-verse script. The cast includes Michael Goorjian, sitting on the
floor, and from left, Jeff Maynard, Maury Sterling and Kevin Weisman.
Presented by Buffalo Nights Theatre Company. Fri.-Sun., 8 p.m. Ends
June 2. $18.</LD>

<HD>Chasing Back for Sweet Success' Scent</HD>
<DH>With a Tony-nominated play and new lots of opportunities,
Marvin Hamlisch may be making another run at the prominence he
enjoyed in the '70s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 20 years have passed since Marvin Hamlisch was one of the
hottest composers for movies and musicals, but he is bidding to
become ubiquitous again. In Southern California this weekend he'll
appear on two stages at once. More about that in a bit.</LD>
<LD>   Hamlisch sizzled in the '70s. He won three Oscars in 1974 for his
scores to "The Sting" and "The Way We Were." On Broadway, he
triumphed as the composer of "A Chorus Line" and "They're Playing Our
Song." But through the 1980s and 1990s, only two shows by Hamlisch
opened on Broadway: "Smile," which closed after 48 performances in
1986, and "The Goodbye Girl," which lasted five months in 1993.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not like I've said no to any show," he said in a phone
interview from Pittsburgh, where he was leading the Pittsburgh
Symphony in his role as its principal pops conductor (Hamlisch holds
the same title with the National Symphony in Washington, D.C.) "It's
that my opportunities have come very far between."</LD>
<TE>   Now he's back on Broadway as the composer of "Sweet Smell of
Success," in which John Lithgow stars as a power-mad 1950s gossip
columnist modeled after Walter Winchell. The show took a critical
torpedoing when it opened in mid-March, but Hamlisch--who insists he
would "not change a note"--says its seven Tony Award nominations,
including best musical and best score, give him hope that the
production can stay afloat.</TE>
<TE>   On June 2, Hamlisch will spend his 58th birthday at the Tony
ceremonies in New York. He plans to kick off the evening by playing
"With a Song in My Heart" on the piano in a tribute to Richard
Rodgers. Then he will take his seat and hope to be called back to
collect a trophy or two.</TE>
<TE>   Even if all goes sour for "Sweet Smell of Success," Hamlisch and
the show's lyricist, Craig Carnelia, have other projects lined up
with high-profile collaborators. They've written the songs for
"Imaginary Friends," a play-with-music by screenwriter-director Nora
Ephron ("When Harry Met Sally ... ," "Sleepless in Seattle"). The
premise is a fictional friendship between Lillian Hellman and Mary
McCarthy, writer-activists who in real life became enemies embroiled
in a slander suit. It is scheduled to make its world premiere Sept.
28 at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Hamlisch and Carnelia also are booked to write the score for a
stage adaptation of Woody Allen's film "Bullets Over Broadway." But
that job is on hold until Allen resolves his lawsuit against his
former producer, Jean Doumanian. "Bullets Over Broadway" is tied up
in the case--one of eight movies for which Allen alleges he was
underpaid.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, as he has for the last two decades, Hamlisch continues
to be a regular on the concert circuit. The real Marvin Hamlisch will
stand up at the Orange County Performing Arts Center on Friday and
Saturday and entertain as he usually does, backed by the Pacific
Symphony in a pops concert built around his own hits and humorous
asides, plus nuggets from other Broadway composers.</TE>
<TE>   The Hamlisch appearing at the Pasadena Playhouse on the same
nights is an impostor whose acquaintance the real one does not care
to make. "A Class Act," tells the story of Edward Kleban, the
lyricist-composer who put words to Hamlisch's music for "A Chorus
Line." Hamlisch is a character in the show, and the reviews say he
does not cut an endearing figure. Hamlisch and Michael Bennett, the
director-choreographer of "A Chorus Line," come off as "nasty
cartoons," The Times' Lewis Segal wrote. The New York Times' review
of last year's Broadway production said it painted a "not entirely
flattering" picture of Hamlisch.</TE>
<TE>   Hamlisch says he read the script of "A Class Act" while it was in
development and saw that it might be troublesome. He suggested
changes in its depiction of how he and Kleban worked together.</TE>
<TE>   "But trying to stop them would have been a mistake," he said.
Hamlisch had no wish to suppress a show devoted to the music of
Kleban, who died of cancer in 1987 at age 48. "I think it's always
important for Ed's work to be out there. The best I could do was put
in my two cents, then walk away." Hamlisch has kept his resolution
not to see "A Class Act," which plays in Pasadena through June 16.
But he has read the reviews.</TE>
<TE>   "I have enough faith in myself and what the public perceives of me
to know a caricature is a caricature," he said. "I don't worry about,
'What is this going to do to your reputation?'"</TE>
<TE>   Hamlisch also has faith that "Sweet Smell of Success" and the
music he wrote for it are quality goods, regardless of the mostly
damning notices.</TE>
<TE>   "Does it hurt? Sure it hurts," Hamlisch concedes. "You gulp for
about three days, then you dust yourself off and keep going." There
was a time when bad reviews and failed shows really threw him. "Since
the age of 7, I had believed that success with music was the key
ingredient to my happiness. I am praised; therefore, I am happy," he
wrote in his 1992 memoir, "The Way I Was." After "Smile" tanked,
Hamlisch wrote, his life turned into a prolonged frown--a period of
depression during which "all I could do was eat myself up alive."
Hamlisch credits Terre Blair, whom he married in 1989, with
dispelling his illusion that only applause could bring happiness.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, after his long absence from the stage, Hamlisch relishes
each new chance to hear the applause and risk critics' brickbats.</TE>
<TE>   "lf it were up to me, I would do a show every year," he said. "The
problem is first you have to find somebody who wants you to do the
music, then somebody to put up the money to do the show. I understand
the process, and that I'm chained to this process, and it's OK. My
love of theater is so great that there's not much that could stop
me."</TE>

<HD>Veteran Ray Brown Galvanizes His Trio</HD>
<DH>The bassist supplies much of the spirit for a talented
group still finding itself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It took a while for the Ray Brown Trio to get fully up to speed
Tuesday night at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill. The veteran bassist, whose
trios have been the incubators for young pianists ranging from Benny
Green and Geoff Keezer to the current incumbent, Larry Fuller, was as
charming and gregarious as ever, and the music typically ranged from
standards to briskly boppish lines.</LD>
<LD>   In the opening portion of the evening, however, Milt Jackson's
tender ballad "Compassion" received a respectful reading that was
more appealing for its colorful harmonic touches than for its inner
emotional probing. "The Lamp Is Low," the '30s standard based upon
Ravel's "Pavane pour une infante defunte," was delivered at a
high-speed pace, abandoning the lovely melody in favor of Fuller's
fast-fingered forays across the keyboard.</LD>
<LD>   With the arrival of Oliver Nelson's floating line, "Stolen
Moments," matters began to improve, as Brown, Fuller and drummer
George Fludas finally seemed to get past opening-night rustiness and
reach deeply into the music.</LD>
<TE>   But it remained for Brown to bring the set fully into focus.
Taking the music squarely onto his shoulders, he launched into a
medley of tunes written by, or associated with, Duke Ellington:
first, an up-tempo romp through "Caravan" featuring Brown's bowed
rendering of the melody; next, a pair of marvelously articulated solo
versions of "Perdido" and "In a Sentimental Mood;" concluding with an
in-the-pocket, groove-rich reading of "Things Ain't What They Used to
Be."</TE>
<TE>   Brown has had such a high level of success with his previous trios
that the bar has been placed extraordinarily high for any succeeding
group. And the current trio still hasn't matched the full creative
expression of past ensembles. Technically, they are first rate, with
Fuller's pianistic virtuosity, in particular, bursting full blown out
of everything he plays. But on this night, the technique couldn't
quite compensate for the lack of emotional engagement that
characterized the first half of the program.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Brown, the consummate, mature professional, made it
work by doing what he has been doing for more than half a
century--bringing musical life and spirit to everything he touches.</TE>

<HD>TV News Reverts to Pre-Sept. 11 Patterns</HD>
<DH>Networks* Coverage of hard news, which jumped after
terrorist attacks, is approaching has dwindled to former levels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>After a period of marked change post-Sept. 11, the network evening
newscasts' coverage of national and international affairs has
decreased, according to a Project for Excellence in Journalism study
to be released today. The content now more closely resembles what
existed before the terrorist attacks and war in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Advance copies of the study circulated Wednesday, a day when cable
news, too, reverted to pre-Sept. 11 mode with heavy speculation over
a possible break in the case of missing Washington intern Chandra
Levy.</LD>
<LD>   The study of the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts, covering the
period from Jan. 1 to April 5, found that stories about national and
international affairs, so-called "hard news," now make up 52% of all
stories, down from 80% in October but up from 45.5% in June 2001.
Lifestyle and celebrity coverage, which almost disappeared in
October, now accounts for 20% of stories, down slightly from 23% in
June 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Business coverage fell dramatically post-Sept. 11 but has risen to
15%, partly attributable to coverage of Enron Corp.'s collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Other categories of coverage, including crime, science and
religion, make up the difference.</TE>
<TE>   The makeup of the hard news has changed since June 2001, the study
found, with increases in coverage of the military and international
affairs and a decrease in domestic affairs.</TE>
<TE>   The study examined story counts, not the number of minutes devoted
to each topic. Paul Slavin, executive producer of ABC's "World News
Tonight," said he found the methodology unclear and took issue with
business stories not being counted as hard news, although he
acknowledged that "yes, we have moved back to a more balanced
program."</TE>
<TE>   "NBC Nightly News" executive producer Steve Capus also took issue
with some classifications but agreed his broadcast has changed, just
as "life is different than it was [in the first months] after
September." He said his program continued to cover hard news, noting,
"We've got a mirror on the world." With viewership of newscasts up,
he said, "America's spoken about the quality of not just our
broadcast but all network broadcasts."</TE>
<TE>   CBS News said in a statement that it "has been committed to hard
news for a long time and has not changed since 9/11," as evidenced by
anchor Dan Rather's three recent overseas trips.</TE>
<TE>   The story in the mornings was somewhat different, with hard news
(22.5%) still a bigger component than before. In June 2001, according
to the study, just 7% of stories dealt with hard news, while
celebrity, entertainment and lifestyle news took up 72%. Immediately
after Sept. 11, the amount of hard news jumped to 58%, while lighter
news dropped to 24%, increasing to 58% in early 2002.</TE>

<HD>Lucas Toiling in Land Far Away</HD>
<DH>Locations* For much of 'Clones' and 'Episode III,' the
director shot in Australia, showing the region's growing allure for
U.S. filmmakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MALCOLM JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones" and "Episode III,"
now in the works, George Lucas, the ultimate Californian, has worked
largely in Australia, far from his home base of Marin County and the
American Southwest, where he filmed many scenes of the hugely
successful original trilogy.</LD>
<LD>   Lucas hasn't turned his back on his country. After his
breakthrough 1973 "American Graffiti," he chose English sound stages
for "Star Wars," with location work in Tunisia as well as Death
Valley. "The Empire Strikes Back" employs locations in Oregon and the
Bay Area's Marin County and Alcatraz, as well as Tunisia, and "Return
of the Jedi" includes scenes in Buttercup Valley in both Arizona and
California. But Lucas is following a trend in working in Australia.</LD>
<LD>   Leaving behind Leavesden Studios in England, where he shot much of
"Episode I The Phantom Menace," Lucas made most of "Episode II" at
Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, where Baz Luhrmann filmed "Moulin
Rouge." But Luhrmann is an Australia native, and his star, Nicole
Kidman, though born in Hawaii, grew up there. The leads in "Attack of
the Clones" are American, British and Canadian; the best-known
Australian face belongs to Jack Thompson, the longtime star seen
briefly as Anakin's stepfather. New Zealand's Temuera Morrison has a
more important role as Obi-Wan's foe, Jango Fett.</LD>
<TE>   Americans are traveling to Australia to shoot big pictures with
increasing frequency. Two Chicago-born brothers, Andy and Larry
Wachowski, chose Sydney as the principal location of "The Matrix" and
its two forthcoming sequels, "The Matrix Reloaded" and "The Matrix
Revolution." And, partly because he was married then to Kidman, Tom
Cruise elected to shoot most of "Mission: Impossible II" in New South
Wales (90 minutes south of Sydney) under the direction of Hong Kong's
John Woo.</TE>
<TE>   It was perhaps only logical that Peter Jackson, a native New
Zealander, would celebrate the beauty of his country, Australia's
neighbor, in the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy.</TE>
<TE>   The trend of making big-budget, special effects-laden films in
Australia and New Zealand follows an invasion of American films by
directors and stars from Down Under. Peter Weir, Bruce Beresford,
Fred Schepisi, George Miller and Gillian Armstrong were among the
first directors whose early films sent them to Hollywood, followed by
Phillip Noyce, Luhrmann, Russell Mulcahy and Simon Wincer.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's 1979 "Mad Max" and Weir's 1981 "Gallipoli" helped
establish Mel Gibson as an international star. Kidman emerged in
Noyce's suspenseful "Dead Calm." The biggest star now working in
American films who began in his native New Zealand is Russell Crowe,
whose career ignited in the U.S. with "L.A. Confidential."</TE>

<LD>   New Combs Album Tops the Charts</LD>
<LD>   Regardless of what name he chooses to go by professionally, Sean
Combs continues to be a commercial force in pop.</LD>
<TE>   The entrepreneur-producer-performer, who once was Puff Daddy and
now calls himself P. Diddy, entered the national sales chart at No. 1
on Wednesday with his latest album, "We Invented the Remix."</TE>
<TE>   The collection, which sold 256,000 copies last week, was one of
five new arrivals in the Top 10. The others: Cam'ron's "Come Home
With Me" (No. 2), Weezer's "Maladroit" (No. 3), Moby's "18" (No. 4)
and Rush's "Vapor Trails" (No. 6). Lauryn Hill's "MTV Unplugged No.
2.0," a solo, acoustic, two-disc live set, suffered the biggest drop
of last week's Top 10. In its second week in stores, the album fell
11 places to No. 14. The nation's best-selling single remains 'N
Sync's pairing with Nelly on "Girlfriend."</TE>
<TE>   'N Sync's Bass a Finalist for Soyuz Space Trip</TE>
<TE>   Lance Bass of 'N Sync is competing with a former NASA official for
the next seat on a Russian spacecraft. The singer has reportedly
secured the support of a Los Angeles TV production company, Destiny
Productions, to help fund his bid, and film the training and trip for
a TV special.</TE>
<TE>   Dmitry Malashenkov, spokesman for Russia's Institute of Biomedical
Problems, said Tuesday that Bass, 23, and ex-NASA employee Lori
Garver were undergoing medical tests at the Moscow center to evaluate
their ability to handle space travel. The results will be forwarded
to a state commission that will deliver a final report.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's space agency continued to express reservations that
complicated contractual negotiations would proceed quickly enough for
a space tourist to participate in October's blast-off to the
International Space Station. Still, it is holding one seat open in
the three-person Soyuz spacecraft, alongside Russian flight commander
Sergei Zaletin and European Space Agency astronaut Frank DeWinne of
Belgium, for as long as possible, it said.</TE>

<TE>   Adams to Succeed Boulez at Carnegie Hall</TE>
<TE>   John Adams, who has written operas about Richard Nixon's historic
visit to China and the terrorist killing of Leon Klinghoffer, will
hold Carnegie Hall's "composer's chair" beginning with the 2003-04
season, succeeding Pierre Boulez.</TE>
<TE>   The New England-born composer, who will serve a three-year term,
will help develop artistic initiatives and plans for Carnegie Hall's
stages, focusing on Zankel Hall, which opens in September 2003.</TE>
<TE>   This September, the world premiere of Adams' "On the
Transmigration of Souls," with texts drawn from cell-phone calls and
other firsthand accounts of the terrorist attacks last Sept. 11, will
be performed as part of the New York Philharmonic's opening-night
program.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>

in his hometown at Liverpool's Walker Gallery on Friday. It is the
UK's first comprehensive exhibition of his work.... Ten-time Gram-

<DL></DL>
<LD>The modern era of backpack journalism gets a sterling showcase with
the pilot episode of "Frontline/World," which takes viewers well off
the beaten path for stories that nevertheless resonate strongly
across our global village.</LD>
<LD>   The series, airing tonight at 8 on KCET and at 10 on KVCR, will
return with weekly editions in the fall.</LD>
<LD>   The new series veers from "Front- line's" single-topic format with
a newsmagazine approach emphasizing shorter pieces. Tonight the focus
is on three stories: tracking the shipment of huge caches of illegal
weapons from Eastern Europe to war-torn Sierra Leone; a look at the
suicide-bomber capital of the world in Sri Lanka; and an eye-opening
look at changes the introduction of satellite TV has brought to the
Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan.</LD>
<TE>   Nestled between China and India, Bhutan is a tiny country of fewer
than a million people that had managed to sequester itself from much
of the outside world for centuries. But once the TV cables began
unfurling, that isolation went with it. Family members now talk of
rushing home from school or work to watch Cartoon Network or
professional wrestling--this in a region with more monks than
soldiers, where traffic lights and fast-food chains were unknown.</TE>
<TE>   One can only wonder how the Bhutanese reacted to the birth of
Rachel's baby on "Friends."</TE>

<HD>Rigases Holding On to Seats</HD>
<DH>Cable: Adelphia's founding family has refused to give up
control of the board, sources say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Troubled cable TV operator Adelphia Communications Corp.'s chances of
averting bankruptcy appeared to narrow Wednesday when the Rigas
family refused to give up their control of Adelphia's board of
directors, according to sources close to the situation.</LD>
<LD>   Banks that have about $5 billion in loans outstanding to Adelphia
on Tuesday agreed to extend the company's credit line if the Rigas
family would step down from the board.</LD>
<LD>   Investors said Wednesday that without additional bank borrowing,
Adelphia, the nation's sixth-biggest cable company, would not be able
to pay off overdue loans and could be forced to file for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection within days.</LD>
<TE>   Sources close to Adelphia said the Rigas family, however, could
agree on short notice to step away from the company because
negotiations are ongoing with the banks and a special committee that
has stepped in to run Adelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and two state attorneys general for questionable
accounting practices involving Rigas family partnerships that
borrowed at least $2.3 billion and used publicly held Adelphia as a
co-guarantor of the loans.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Adelphia founder John Rigas and his son Tim Rigas
resigned their respective posts as chief executive and chief
financial officer of the company. Despite pressure from banks,
outside directors and shareholders, the Rigases have remained in
control of five of eight Adelphia board seats. The Rigases control
60% of the voting shares of Adelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia is the largest cable operator in Los Angeles and it has
1.2million customers in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing in Los Angeles on Wednesday, local Adelphia
executives assured city regulators that the company was in compliance
with its cable franchise agreements and continues to service its
customers and to pay its 3,000 employees.</TE>
<TE>   The executives, however, acknowledged that Adelphia had
temporarily halted upgrading its cable networks to offer services
such as high-speed Internet access to more of its customers.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Adelphia, which lags behind other cable operators in
digital equipment, is curtailing the upgrades to conserve cash.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia last week named Erland Kailborne, one of three outside
directors, to succeed John Rigas as chief executive. Kailborne is
leading an investigation into the company's financial practices and
negotiations with the family to step down from the board.</TE>
<TE>   The banks and Adelphia's special committee have been urging the
Rigases to put $2 billion of assets from their private partnerships
into the public company to cover various debts. Among the assets held
in the private partnerships are cable systems, company stock and
convertible bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to Adelphia said some shareholders are worried that
the Rigases may sell valuable company assets at fire sale prices to
pay down its more than $15 billion in debts.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the company suspended an audit being conducted by its
auditor Deloitte &amp; Touche to investigate transactions between the
family and the company.</TE>

<HD>Albertson's to Add, Change Stores</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Supermarket giant Albertson's Inc. said Wednesday that it would spend
$1 billion in the next three years to remodel and add expanded food
and drug stores in Southern California to better compete with rivals
Ralphs and Vons.</LD>
<LD>   Boise, Idaho-based Albertson's has been struggling to gain a
bigger share in this highly competitive market after acquiring the
Lucky chain when it bought American Stores Co.</LD>
<LD>   The investment will be split between its Albertsons and Sav-on
Drug chains. Over the next three years, it will open about 30 new
Albertsons stores and remodel 82 of its existing 268 locations in
Southern California. Sav-on, the leading drugstore chain in Southern
California, will remodel 20 of its 304 stores and open about 96 new
stores, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Although rivals Ralphs and Vons have added pharmacies to many of
their supermarkets over the last several years, many of the new
Albertson's stores will put a full supermarket and drugstore under
one roof.</TE>
<TE>   Albertson's has run these hybrid stores for a number of years in
markets such as Reno, Tucson and Chicago with much success.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe these stores will really win over customers," said
Jonathan Ziegler, an analyst with Deutsche Bank in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Although it had cut prices and run more promotions, analysts said,
Albertson's smaller, dated stores, mainly former Lucky stores, put
them at a competitive disadvantage. "Lucky hadn't done a lot in
keeping these stores current," Ziegler said.</TE>
<TE>   The Albertsonses and Sav-ons will be managed separately, but share
the same space and checkout stands so customers can fill their basket
and pay at one time.</TE>
<TE>   "They already have customers in their stores; now they can just
get them to buy a bigger basket," said Meredith Adler, an analyst
with Lehman Bros. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The first of the new hybrid supermarket-drugstores will open in
about a year, officials said, and they will make up a large number of
the remodels and new store openings.</TE>
<TE>   However, officials declined to give specific locations or the
number of these new hybrid stores planned.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason we're putting them together is to increase sales,"
said Albertson's President Peter Lynch. Its converted food and drug
stores in Chicago have seen sales increase in the "double digits"
from the make-over, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Albertson's last year declared its intent to boost business in
California, the largest food market in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Albertson's had alienated many Southern California customers after
it bought the Lucky chain in 1999 and changed its name.</TE>
<TE>   With no club card discounts and fewer of the bargains its
competitors offered, the chain had lost some ground with shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   But over the last year, cost cutting and more competitive
promotions have put the chain back on track, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   And with stores in mostly prime locations, the overhaul should
help the chain, which operates 2,300 stores nationwide, to turn up
the pressure on its rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Safeway and Ralphs officials declined to comment on the increased
competition other than to note the number of stores they have opened
or remodeled in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's top three supermarket chains have struggled to stem
the loss of food sales to club stores, drugstores and discounters
like Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which announced last week that it was
building 40 stores in California over the next four to six years.</TE>
<TE>   News of the move pushed Albertson's stock up $1.91 to $34.06 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Duncan Shredding Confusion Described</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>An Arthur Andersen executive testified Wednesday that the leader of
its Enron Corp. audit team, David B. Duncan, sought to destroy an
internal memo, saying, "Another smoking gun. We don't need this."</LD>
<LD>   The memo served as a cover letter for an e-mail discussing an
Enron insider's claims of fraudulent accounting there. David Stulb,
the Andersen executive, said that the cover note described the
enclosed e-mail as "smoking guns," and that Duncan was poised to
throw it away before Stulb told him to keep it.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen is charged with obstruction of justice for shredding
documents related to its audit of fallen energy trader Enron. Federal
prosecutors have been trying to show that Andersen was attempting to
withhold evidence from the Securities and Exchange Commission as the
agency began its probe of Enron.</LD>
<TE>   Stulb, chief of Andersen's fraud investigation unit, said he was
concerned that Duncan failed to understand which documents should be
kept. After the Oct. 31 incident, Stulb said, he called Andersen
senior partner John Geron to alert him to the situation. At Geron's
behest, Stulb testified, he called Nancy Temple, an Andersen staff
attorney in Chicago, that same day and told her that Duncan "needed
guidance" on document retention.</TE>
<TE>   Stulb's testimony provided the most direct evidence so far that
senior members of the firm knew of a potential problem with document
destruction in Houston, where the Enron audit team was based.
Prosecutors had noted earlier in the trial that Andersen didn't
explicitly order Duncan to cease any document destruction until after
the firm received an SEC subpoena Nov. 8. Duncan, the government's
star witness, testified last week that he called a meeting of the
Enron auditing team Oct. 23 and instructed its members to comply with
Andersen's document-retention policy. He said his effort was prompted
in part by an Oct. 12 e-mail, sent by Temple and forwarded to him,
asking the Enron team to comply with the policy.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, however, testified last week that he viewed the use of the
term "smoking guns" in the cover sheet as sarcastic.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan has pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and is
cooperating with federal investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Stulb said he traveled to Houston last October at the request of
senior Andersen executives who wanted him to help the firm and Enron
prepare for an SEC inquiry of the energy trader's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Andersen lead attorney Rusty Hardin said
Stulb's portrayal of Duncan as a confused accountant bolsters the
defense team's contention that the auditor lacked "corrupt" intent,
which is required under the language of the obstruction statute.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Hardin said, Stulb did not say that he specifically
informed Temple of Duncan's attempt to dispose of a document, only
that Duncan needed guidance.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is she [Temple] supposed to think he was destroying
documents?" Hardin asked.</TE>
<TE>   But Stulb offered other testimony that appeared to back the
prosecution's assertion that top Andersen executives knew the Enron
account was trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Stulb testified that he told senior Andersen executives that he
viewed the Vinson &amp; Elkins report as a whitewash. The report had been
ordered to examine allegations by Enron Vice President Sherron S.
Watkins that Enron had been conducting insider deals with
partnerships run by its own chief financial officer, Andrew S.
Fastow.</TE>
<TE>   The report concluded that there were no improprieties. It was
Watkins' allegations that were the subject of the e-mail and cover
note with the "smoking guns" reference, which had been written by
Andersen partner James Hecker.</TE>
<TE>   In other testimony Wednesday, an FBI agent testified that an
Andersen partner based in London told him that Duncan informed him
during a conference call last October that Enron-related drafts and
e-mails should be destroyed. The agent, Raju Bhatia, said that
partner Michael Jones, Andersen's lead Enron auditor in London, told
him in an interview that the destruction of Enron-related files in
London noticeably increased in the wake of the conference call.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin said outside of court he did not know why prosecutors
didn't call Jones himself to the witness stand.</TE>
<TE>   In questioning of Bhatia and another FBI agent Wednesday, Hardin
tried to underscore the point that memos and e-mails being used by
prosecutors against the firm were all records that had been retained
by Andersen.</TE>

<HD>Blue Cross Backs Off 'Tiered Hospital' Idea</HD>
<DH>Health care: California insurer's plan to sell policies
linking hospital price rankings to patients' out-of-pocket costs
meets strong opposition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under pressure from hospitals, Blue Cross of California has backed
off selling "tiered hospital" policies, which group hospitals by cost
and increase co-payments for consumers who use the costlier
facilities.</LD>
<LD>   Senior executives at Blue Cross, the state's largest health
insurer, said the company changed course after encountering vigorous
opposition from hospitals. Blue Cross has had a contentious
relationship with hospitals and recently the insurance company has
tried to take a more conciliatory approach.</LD>
<LD>   Tiered hospital plans have come under fire since PacifiCare Health
Systems Inc. and Blue Shield of California introduced them this year
as a way to reduce premiums and contend with escalating hospital
costs.</LD>
<TE>   In a typical tiered plan, a member who goes to a hospital that is
on an insurance company's preferred list pays nothing out of pocket
or the minimum coinsurance. But a member who uses a hospital that the
insurer considered too expensive would be required to make
co-payments of as much as $400 a day or pay a bigger percentage in
coinsurance.</TE>
<TE>   A co-payment is a fixed dollar amount that a patient pays for each
procedure, such as $10 for a visit to the doctor; a coinsurance
payment is based on a percentage of the actual bill.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials have complained that tiered pricing unfairly
labels hospitals as cheap or too expensive, without taking into
account quality, specialties offered and other factors.</TE>
<TE>   Two small hospitals owned by NorthBay Healthcare Corp. in Northern
California recently canceled contracts with Blue Shield, upset that
their hospitals did not make Blue Shield's "Choice" list.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer groups have voiced concerns that these kinds of plans
penalize lower-income families and steer people to hospitals that are
crowded or provide lower-quality care.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Cross executives did not rule out the possibility that they
may offer similar tiered hospital plans in the future. And Wednesday,
the company took a step in that direction.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Cross officials, in a meeting with officials at major
hospitals, said the insurer will place one of four icons next to
hospitals in its provider directories. Blue Cross did not describe
what the icons would look like, but said each would represent a price
category of hospital, from least expensive to most expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Cross said the icons were intended to give consumers
information, and it would not offer policies that would charge a
higher co-payment or a coinsurance for members who use the more
expensive hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   For consumers, these icons may make a difference. In a typical
preferred provider organization arrangement, a member pays 20% of the
hospital charges, with the insurance carrier covering the rest.</TE>
<TE>   PPO members usually can't compare prices of similar services from
one hospital to another. But with the icons, members may elect to use
the hospital that is considered cheaper, and that could lower the
overall amount they would have to pay in coinsurance.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts viewed this step by Blue Cross as a compromise.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be an initial, more palatable first step," said Larry
Levitt, an analyst at Kaiser Family Foundation, a Menlo Park, Calif.,
health policy organization. "It suggests that every [health] plan is
feeling pressure to push back against the hospitals. This kind of
approach doesn't go as far as tiering, but it's part of a broader
effort to fight back against consolidations and rate demands by
hospitals."</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials had mixed reactions to Blue Cross' plans.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that if they're just putting icons, whether people
will know what that means," said JoAnne Tucker, vice president of
business services at Hoag Memorial Hospital in Newport Beach.
"Everybody is grappling at things that they hope will work, and we
just don't know yet."</TE>

<HD>Allergan Bets on Botox Lift</HD>
<DH>Irvine firm is mounting a media blitz for the wrinkle
treatment and hopes it will transform its business</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kimberly Horowitz is an international gem buyer specializing in
diamonds, brokering deals in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. In
her line of work, a confident, relaxed appearance can be the
difference between negotiating a great price or merely a good one.
That's why she decided her crow's feet had to go.</LD>
<LD>   "Lines and furrows make you look tense or worried even when you're
not. In my job, I try to have a poker face," said Horowitz, 41. The
Sherman Oaks resident relies on injections of botulinum toxin type A,
or Botox, to lose the lines without undergoing surgery.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a wonderful tool. Your face looks very relaxed, like
someone who has been on the beach for a week. That's how it makes me
feel," Horowitz said.</LD>
<TE>   That also makes her the kind of person whom Allergan Inc. hopes to
attract in droves through a nationwide media blitz for its Botox
Cosmetic. The Irvine company is positioning Botox as a simple, safe
and affordable way to inhibit the signs of aging.</TE>
<TE>   "Your toughest wrinkle," it says in a print ad, with lines
superimposed on a woman's forehead. "It took 40 years to get it and
10 minutes to do something about it."</TE>
<TE>   But Allergan is banking on much more from Botox, which is the
company's biggest product, with worldwide sales of $310 million in
2001 and $88.6 million in the first quarter of 2002. Company
executives are hoping that it will mitigate the potential loss of
sales for its next-best-selling drug, glaucoma medication Alphagen,
which is losing its battle in federal court against generic
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Taking Advantage of the Drug's Versatility</TE>
<TE>   Company executives also hope that Botox will fuel Allergan's
transformation into a specialty-pharmaceuticals-only business as they
sell off its ophthalmic surgical devices and well-known
contact-lens-care units. That makes Botox even more important to help
fund research and development, and Allergan intends to milk it
throughout the decade.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to look at Botox as a series of waves. The first was
movement disorders. The second is the cosmetic wave," said Eric
Brandt, Allergan's chief executive. "The next wave is [use for] pain
and headaches, in the 2006 time frame."</TE>
<TE>   Brandt said 2008-2009 could see the use of Botox on so-called
smooth or involuntary muscles that function automatically, such as
those of the intestines. He said it might be effective on a type of
intestinal lesion whose healing requires the muscles to relax.</TE>
<TE>   "Botox is very much a versatile and strategic product," Brandt
said. "It's an excellent motor to drive the company forward for some
of the earlier-stage technology we want to produce in the next three
to five years."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts differ on the scope of Botox sales growth around the
world, but most say Botox growth will be significant, with competing
formulations and technological alternatives as much as three years
distant. Cosmetic purposes account for about one-third of Botox
sales, an Allergan spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Allergan is hoping for a 25% to 35% increase in Botox sales for
2002, up to $385 million to $420 million, said Morningstar analyst
Travis Pascavis.</TE>
<TE>   "It's realistic. That's not a blockbuster by industry standards,
but it is by Allergan standards and that would be very successful,"
Pascavis said.</TE>
<TE>   Corey Davis, an analyst for J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., said Botox
"could hit $740 million in annual sales by 2005."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Allergan fell 69 cents to $58.21 on the New York Stock
Exchange on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Allergan is dwarfed by its biggest competitors in the
pharmaceutical industry. It posted revenue of $1.7 billion in 2001,
compared with $32.2 billion for Pfizer Inc., the nation's biggest
drug maker.</TE>
<TE>   But Allergan executives say that this is an unfair and inaccurate
comparison and that they are well-placed in the specialty
pharmaceuticals market, which comprises smaller companies that
typically do not engage in their own research and development, as
Allergan does. Such companies can afford to promote products that
sell in the low hundreds of millions of dollars and below, a level
the giants can't justify.</TE>
<TE>   Botox has been around for years, purified and used in small
amounts from the same bacterium that causes botulism, a rare but
sometimes fatal paralytic illness. Botox was originally approved in
the U.S. and several other countries for neuromuscular treatment of
strabismus, or crossed eyes; for blepharospasm, an uncontrollable
blinking of the eyes that renders a victim clinically blind; and for
cervical dystonia, uncontrollable neck spasms.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Food and Drug Administration had not approved
other uses of Botox in the U.S., doctors still were permitted to
prescribe it for off-label purposes such as cosmetic improvements. It
does not remove wrinkles or creases, doctors say, but stops the
muscle contractions that create them. A treatment usually lasts three
to four months.</TE>
<TE>   Allergan is riding the FDA's recent and first approval of Botox
use for cosmetic purposes in treating a specific kind of wrinkle: the
vertical lines that can develop just above the nose and between the
eyebrows. That is significant because Allergan now can advertise
Botox for that purpose.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really closer to selling makeup than selling a drug that
treats cancer or AIDS or other types of serious illness," said Terri
Seligman, an attorney with the law firm Loeb &amp; Loeb who reviews ads
for clients to make sure they won't be sued for making unrealistic
claims or false statements about competitors. "This is appealing to a
person's vanity."</TE>
<TE>   Botox is not without its critics. They seize on information from
doctors that Botox, once a rather exclusive option of the wealthy and
successful actors and actresses, now is being used by younger and
younger Americans at the faintest hint of a wrinkle.</TE>
<TE>   Allergan, these detractors say, is just adding to the nonstop mix
of advertisements that bludgeon consumers with a unhealthy image of
women who are too skinny, too artificial and too willing to portray
age as something that must be hidden at all costs.</TE>
<TE>   How Far Will a Woman Go for Beauty?</TE>
<TE>   Botox is "not a simple extension of cosmetics. Parts of your face
are paralyzed for several months," said Manon Slome, a feminist
museum curator who is about to open a three-month art exhibit at the
Jewish Community Center in Manhattan called "Dangerous Beauty," which
is critical of "ageist and sexist images of beauty that products such
as Botox perpetuate."</TE>
<TE>   Debbie Ramos of Whittier has refused invitations to join Botox
parties, where customers can get a cut rate from a doctor by bringing
in lots of business.</TE>
<TE>   Ramos, 40, said some women have received Botox injections above
the nose, across the forehead and around the eyes for crow's feet
"all at once. They look totally dead because they can't change their
expressions. People are out of control.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe they should use Preparation H instead," Ramos said. "It
eases the swelling, takes out wrinkles and it's a good moisturizer
too."</TE>
<TE>   Worldwide sales of Botox, which have increased more than
twelvefold since 1993, suggest that these critics are a distinct
minority.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ted Daly averages about six Botox patients a week and says
that he isn't bothered that those numbers will grow because of
Allergan's ad campaign. Daly has a private practice in Garden City,
N.Y., and is director of pediatric dermatology at Long Island's
Nassau University Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   "If I think they don't need it, I'm going to tell them they don't
need it," Daly said, adding that the procedures usually cost patients
$300 to $600.</TE>
<TE>   "People are pretty much uniformly satisfied."</TE>

<HD>Ross Stores' Profit Rises 37%; Restoration Hardware's Loss
Narrows</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ross Stores Inc. said Wednesday that profit rose 37% in its fiscal
first quarter to $47.7 million, or 59 cents a share, meeting raised
expectations, as it boosted sales and controlled costs.</LD>
<LD>   Several other California retailers also announced improved results
for the fiscal quarter ended May4.</LD>
<LD>   The Newark-based discount retailer benefited from adding more
brand-name clothing and home goods, investors said.</LD>
<TE>   Sales climbed 22% to $819.6 million, and sales at stores open at
least a year jumped 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Restoration Hardware Inc. said its first-quarter loss narrowed,
helped by a $10.1-million tax benefit, to $6.85 million, or 25 cents
a share, from $7.43 million, or 46 cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Sales fell 1.8% to $69.4 million. Earlier this month, the Corte
Madera-based home furnishings retailer said it restated its results
for fiscal 2000 and 2001 after changing how it accounts for furniture
sales.</TE>
<TE>   Children's apparel retailer Gymboree Corp. reported profit of
$6.09million, or 20 cents a share, contrasted with a net loss of
$369,000, or 1 cent, a year earlier. Sales at the Burlingame-based
company rose 4% to $129 million.</TE>
<TE>   Hot Topic Inc.'s net income grew 10% to $3.68 million, or 11 cents
a share, as sales surged 27% to $79.9 million. Same-store sales at
City of Industry-based Hot Topic edged down 0.5%.</TE>
<TE>   In Nasdaq trading, Ross rose $1.05 to $41.53, Restoration rose 15
cents to $9.95, Gymboree fell $1.34 to $16.94, and Hot Topic rose 11
cents to $25.30, all before the results were released.</TE>

<HD>Golden State Stock Saw Heavy Trading</HD>
<DH>Banking: Word of a takeover may have gotten out before the
announcement was made, some say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unusually heavy trading in the stock of Golden State Bancorp Inc. in
the days before the announcement of Citigroup Inc.'s $5.8-billion
acquisition of the San Francisco thrift suggests some investors were
betting a takeover was coming, analysts said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The analysts said they first shrugged off the heavier-than-usual
volume and even told investors not to take it seriously after it
began to be reported Friday. But it now appears that word of the deal
got out before the acquisition was announced Tuesday, said analyst
Paul J. Miller at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp; Co.</LD>
<LD>   A spokeswoman for the Securities and Exchange Commission said the
agency "keeps an eye out" for such trading surges, but doesn't
comment on individual cases. It is illegal to trade on material,
non-public information about a stock.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Golden State, owner of California Federal Bank, began a
big run-up, on heavy volume, on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   News reports that afternoon that investors were snapping up Golden
State options apparently fueled further purchases. The stock, which
closed Thursday at $33.51, had risen to $36.50 on heavy trading by
the time the deal was announced after the close of trading Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Trading volume, meanwhile, was running from two to four times
Golden State's normal activity, according to Bloomberg News data.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Painchaud at Market Profile Theorems, which tracks trading
by insiders, said there was no indication that Golden State's
controlling shareholders, Ronald Perelman and Gerald Ford, or anyone
else at the company had unfairly benefited by their knowledge of a
deal. Indeed, in the last year Golden State insiders have been
sellers of the stock, not buyers, Painchaud said.</TE>
<TE>   Janis Tarter, a spokeswoman for Golden State, said the company was
aware of the stock activity but has "no idea what caused it."
Citigroup declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Golden State shares closed at $39.34, up $2.84,
while Citigroup lost 26 cents to close at $45, both on the New York
Stock Exchange. The merger is expected to be completed late this
year, with Citigroup's cash and stock offer worth $39.95 a share at
Wednesday's closing share price.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts also said the takeover, which would give Citigroup the
fourth-largest deposit base in California, was a case of the New York
banking giant making a second-choice acquisition because the first
choice wasn't available.</TE>
<TE>   The No. 1 option, according to analysts, was UnionBanCal Corp., a
commercial bank with $35 billion in assets and extensive
business-banking activities.</TE>
<TE>   They say Union Bank fits better with Citigroup, the nation's
largest and most diversified financial institution, than does CalFed.
Despite some commercial business and real estate lending, CalFed
remains basically a savings and loan, taking consumer deposits and
issuing CDs, investing mainly in mortgages and mortgage securities.</TE>
<TE>   Miller and others said that despite strong interest in Union Bank
from institutions wanting entry to the California banking market, the
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi hasn't been ready to let go of its majority
share in the San Francisco-based bank--at least not at a desirable
price.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese bank, with $600 billion in assets, has suffered along
with the rest of Japan's battered banking industry but is in better
shape than most.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Citi talked to Union and to others [in the California
market] but had to walk away," said analyst Mark Agah at RBC Capital
Markets.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup, which has expanded its private banking operations
recently in California to serve the personal needs of affluent
small-business owners, has made no secret of its interest in
financing their companies as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Citi said they want a retail franchise," which they get by buying
Golden State and its 352 branches, Miller said. "But what they really
want is both a retail and a commercial platform."</TE>

<HD>Disney Warns of Pooh Lawsuit Risk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co. revealed in a government filing last week that a
court fight over the merchandising rights to the Winnie the Pooh
characters could, in the worst-case scenario, cost the company
several hundred million dollars.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosure was made in a quarterly filing May 15 with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. It marks the first time Disney
has notified shareholders of the potential effect of the 11-year-old
legal battle with Stephen Slesinger Inc. That family-owned firm
acquired the merchandising rights to the Hundred Acre Wood characters
from author A.A. Milne in 1930.</LD>
<LD>   "If each of the plaintiff's claims were to be confirmed in a final
judgment, damages could total as much as several hundred million
dollars and adversely impact the value to the company of any future
exploitation of the licensed rights" for Pooh merchandise, according
to the filing.</LD>
<TE>   Slesinger's heirs claim Burbank-based Disney has cheated them out
of $200 million in royalties since 1983 from Pooh-related videos,
DVDs, computer software and popular Pooh attractions at theme parks.
Disney contends that it has fulfilled its royalty obligations under a
1983 contract.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial in February.</TE>
<TE>   "As this case has gotten closer to trial, it has gotten more and
more attention, and we thought it was appropriate for us to let our
shareholders know," Disney spokeswoman Michelle Bergman said.</TE>
<TE>   Bonnie Eskenazi, one of the lawyers representing Slesinger, said
the filing was significant because "Disney has adamantly denied that
there was even a possibility of terminating the future rights to the
use of Pooh."</TE>
<TE>   But Disney lead attorney Daniel Petrocelli said the filing does
not change Disney's view that "whatever the outcome of the lawsuit,
the Slesinger company is not in a position to reclaim and exploit any
Winnie the Pooh rights on its own.... We think the Slesinger company
is grossly overreaching."</TE>
<TE>   Pooh and his friends are among the most lucrative of Disney
characters and a key contributor to the company's struggling consumer
products unit.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, Pooh has been a significant franchise, and anything that
would jeopardize that going forward would have a long-term impact on
their earnings," said Tom Wolzien, an analyst with Sanford C.
Bernstein &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Disney shares fell 39 cents to $23.45 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Electricity Firms Deny Enron-Style Trading Strategies</HD>
<DH>Energy: Marketers defend behavior as FERC widens probe to
include natural gas sellers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some of California's biggest electricity players on Wednesday denied
Enron-style manipulation of California's electricity market, but a
few admitted to federal regulators that they engaged in some types of
trading that critics contend may have worsened the state's energy
woes.</LD>
<LD>   All of the companies defended their behavior as legal and within
the rules of the state's electricity markets run by the California
Power Exchange and the California Independent System Operator,
according to filings Wednesday with the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Williams Cos. said it found no "Enron-style trading strategies"
but did identify a small volume of trades "that have some of the
characteristics described in the Enron memo but which were engaged in
for entirely different reasons."</LD>
<TE>   Williams, which markets electricity from four California power
plants owned by AES Corp., said it legally sold California power
outside the state, but did not re-import it at a higher price.</TE>
<TE>   Internal memos disclosed this month show that Enron Corp. exported
power and then brought it back for sale at a higher price--a tactic
it dubbed "ricochet."</TE>
<TE>   "We are--and always have been--very different from Enron," said
Steve Malcolm, chief executive of the Tulsa, Okla.-based energy
company.</TE>
<TE>   The Enron memos were disclosed May 6 by FERC as part of its probe
of California's troubled energy markets. The revelations outraged
state officials who long had claimed that the energy crisis was
exacerbated by trading tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Two days after releasing the memos, FERC broadened its
investigation and ordered scores of power sellers--from power plant
owners to traders to municipal utilities--to state whether they used
the same sorts of strategies.</TE>
<TE>   The ploys included creating congestion on transmission lines and
then being paid to relieve the congestion, and selling power out of
state and then reselling it back into the state at higher prices. The
Enron memos said rival companies had adopted some of the same
tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Energy consultant Robert McCullough was skeptical of the power
sellers' claims that they did not use the kind of tactics that Enron
pioneered. "Obviously, admissions of guilt will be grudging at best,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   FERC did not release the responses, but several companies issued
statements on their filings to FERC.</TE>
<TE>   Investigation to Include Sellers of Natural Gas</TE>
<TE>   Separately, FERC on Wednesday widened its investigation of
questionable trading strategies to include sellers of natural gas in
California and other Western states. The investigation of "wash"
trading--prearranged deals in which a company sells a given volume of
a commodity to another firm and then buys it back at the same
price--had been focused on electricity marketers.</TE>
<TE>   Of the large power plant owners in California that have been
repeatedly accused of manipulating the state's power markets and of
not running power plants to peak capacity, only Calpine Corp. gave
itself a completely clean bill of health. Duke Energy Corp., Dynegy
Inc., Mirant Corp. and Reliant Resources Inc. denied using most of
the Enron strategies--particularly the most controversial--but
acknowledged limited trading practices of the type that FERC is
questioning.</TE>
<TE>   * Duke, which operates four California power plants, said it did
not use the strategies detailed in the Enron memos but did engage in
"other activities that have some of the characteristics described in
the Enron memoranda, but are within market rules."</TE>
<TE>   The Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke said it bought power from the
California Power Exchange and exported it out of state to meet power
obligations, but only during 11 hours of more than 9,000 hours during
which the PX was in operation in 2000 and 2001. Duke said it
occasionally appeared to create congestion, but those power
deliveries were scheduled for legitimate business reasons.</TE>
<TE>   * Houston-based Dynegy denied using the tactics of Enron but
acknowledged submitting estimates to Cal-ISO for power needs that
were too high. Dynegy said it did so on the assumption that the
state's utilities would submit estimates that were too low, resulting
in a balanced schedule.</TE>
<TE>   * Atlanta-based Mirant, another California generator, did not
release its FERC filing but said in statement that it was able to
deny eight of the 10 Enron strategies. The company said it submitted
false load schedules to Cal-ISO, but did so with the grid operator's
approval. Mirant also said that, on a single day, it sold power
outside California and bought back a similar amount for resale within
the state. A Mirant spokesman declined to say whether a profit was
made.</TE>
<TE>   * Houston-based Reliant Resources repeated a previous admission
that it infrequently overscheduled power on the state's electricity
grid and shipped power out of state when California was starved for
megawatts. Reliant noted that Cal-ISO had the power to cut exports
during electricity emergencies, but never did so.</TE>
<TE>   "Our practices were proper and lawful, aimed at serving the public
interest while delivering shareholder value," said Hugh Rice Kelly,
Reliant's general counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's 'Ricochet' Technique Decried</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the Bonneville
Power Administration, which were criticized during the crisis for
charging high prices, denied using the Enron trading tactics.
Spokesmen for the two public power marketers expressed dismay that
Enron used DWP and BPA transmission lines to work some of their
schemes.</TE>
<TE>   Enron was able to pull off its "ricochet" technique at times by
sending power to Oregon over transmission lines owned by the DWP and
back into California over BPA lines to evade price caps on in-state
power. Cal-ISO could not tell that the power it was buying had
originated in California because it does not control the DWP or BPA
transmission lines.</TE>

<HD>FBI Agents Charged in Securities Fraud</HD>
<DH>Courts: An indictment alleges the two used government
databases to provide information to a stock 'short seller.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two FBI agents helped an Encinitas-based stock "short seller" shake
down publicly traded firms by sneaking him confidential information
on investigations of the companies, authorities alleged Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Lynn Wingate, an FBI agent assigned to the bureau's Albuquerque
office; Jeffrey Royer, a former Oklahoma City agent who resigned late
last year; and short-seller Amr "Tony" Elgindy were among five men
charged in a securities fraud indictment unsealed in federal court in
Brooklyn, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   A judge ordered Elgindy, 34, held without bond Wednesday after
prosecutors contended he was a flight risk. He was taken into custody
in San Diego. Bail was set for an associate, Troy Peters, 39, at
$200,000.</LD>
<TE>   In 2000 and 2001, another associate of Elgindy, Derrick Cleveland,
wired Royer $30,000 while he was an FBI agent, the indictment said.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for money, the agents used FBI databases to provide
their co-conspirators inside FBI information on publicly traded
companies, the papers said.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, Royer searched the FBI's confidential National Crime
Information Center database and found the criminal history of a top
executive for a firm called Nuclear Solutions, the papers said. The
same day, Elgindy began sending e-mails calling the executive "a
convicted felon," the papers added.</TE>
<TE>   Elgindy spread negative information on the firms on his Web site,
AnthonyPacific.com, and to Brooklyn subscribers of his e-mail
newsletter, InsideTruth.com, while short-selling the shares--that is,
borrowing stock and selling it, betting that the market price would
drop.</TE>
<TE>   If the bet was correct, Elgindy could buy back the borrowed shares
at a lower price and pocket the difference between that price and the
sale price.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants "sometimes reported negative information about the
targeted companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
FBI in order to initiate or hasten regulatory and law enforcement
action, which they knew would cause the stock prices to fall sharply
once such action became public," the indictment said.</TE>
<TE>   Elgindy, who also operates a company known as Pacific Equity
Investigations, and Cleveland also extorted cheap or free shares of
stock in exchange for agreeing to stop their smear campaigns,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   After Elgindy and Royer became the focus of a grand jury probe,
Wingate allegedly fed Royer--by then an employee of Elgindy--secret
information, including descriptions of subpoenaed documents.</TE>
<TE>   The charges "reveal a shocking partnership between an experienced
stock manipulator and law enforcement agents, undertaken for their
illicit personal financial gain," said U.S. Atty. Alan Vinegrad.</TE>
<TE>   Royer, 39, and Wingate, 34, were in custody in Albuquerque, and
Cleveland, 37, in Oklahoma City, pending court appearances. Their
attorneys could not be immediately reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted of racketeering conspiracy and other charges, each
man could receive 20 years in prison.</TE>

<HD>New Economic Report Sparks Hope in Japan</HD>
<DH>Asia: Growing optimism is strengthening the yen against the
dollar. Tokyo stock market reaches a nine-month high.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Japan's economy probably grew for the first time in a year in the
first quarter, new data showed Wednesday, in a report that sent
Japanese stocks to a nine-month high.</LD>
<LD>   The news also added more fuel to the yen's powerful surge against
the dollar in recent weeks, before the government intervened to halt
the rally--with limited success.</LD>
<LD>   Rising exports of cars and an increase in factory production
boosted the so-called all-industry index, used as a gauge for gross
domestic product, by 0.6% in the first quarter from the previous
quarter, a government report showed.</LD>
<TE>   "Japan's economy has bottomed out, there's no question about
that," said Yasukazu Shimizu, senior economist at Aozora Bank Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   The Bank of Japan concurred, raising its assessment of the
economy. "The pace of deterioration has moderated," the bank said in
its monthly report. "Production is starting to pick up, reflecting
the increase in exports." Still, consumer spending will remain weak,
it said.</TE>
<TE>   The news lifted the Nikkei-225 share index 160.82 points, or 1.4%,
to 11,961.98, its highest close since August. The index is up 13.5%
this year, while the U.S. blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index has
fallen 5.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Rising optimism about the potential for a Japanese economic
rebound has helped bolster the yen's value in recent weeks. The yen
strengthened from 132 per dollar in mid-April to a five-month high of
124.09 Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday the yen rallied again, reaching 123.53 per dollar.
That triggered the government to sell yen in an attempt to halt the
currency's advance.</TE>
<TE>   "The yen's rise was too rapid," Japanese Finance Minister Masajuro
Shiokawa said after instructing the Bank of Japan to sell yen.</TE>
<TE>   But international investors bought yen, offsetting the
government's sales, so they could scoop up Japanese stocks as a bet
the world's second-largest economy is pulling out of recession.</TE>
<TE>   The government is "fighting a losing battle" against a stronger
yen, said John Taylor, chairman of FX Concepts, which has $4.5
billion under management.</TE>
<TE>   The intervention weakened the yen to 125.06 per dollar, but it
rallied again to end at 124.22 in New York, off only slightly from
Tuesday's close.</TE>
<TE>   Before this year's rally, the weak yen had helped exporters such
as Nissan Motor boost earnings, limiting the economy's slide. A weak
currency makes a nation's exports more affordable for foreign buyers.</TE>
<TE>   The yen's resurgence will have the opposite effect, potentially
raising the cost of exports. That "is negative for profits" of
Japanese industrial giants, said Shuichi Yamada, a general manager at
chemical firm Nippon Shokubai Co.</TE>
<TE>   "A strong export performance is Japan's only chance of coming out
of recession, so you can understand why politicians are getting a bit
twitchy," said Haydn Davies, who helps manage $800 billion at
Barclays Global Investors in London.</TE>
<TE>   But "with the economy improving, it's going to be difficult for
them to keep the yen weakening for any amount of time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Japanese stock market's performance, and the yen's
surge, is boosting returns for U.S. investors in Japanese stocks. The
Nikkei's gain so far this year in dollar terms is 20.2%.</TE>

<HD>Rumor of Bin Laden Capture Sparks Rally</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: U.S. military denies rumor after the Dow rose
0.5% and Nasdaq climbed 0.6%. Gold marches higher.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks ended mixed Wednesday as a rumor that Osama bin Laden had been
captured helped drive major indexes higher in the final 30 minutes of
trading.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. military denied the rumor, but not in time to halt a
rally that left the Dow Jones industrial average up 52.17 points, or
0.5%, at 10,157.88, and the Nasdaq composite up 9.27 points, or 0.6%,
at 1,673.45.</LD>
<LD>   The market traded modestly lower for most of the session, with the
Dow off as much as 42 points and Nasdaq down as much as 20 points.
Trading volume was light.</LD>
<TE>   In other action, gold continued to march higher, with near-term
gold futures gaining $2.20 to $318 an ounce in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar's sell-off was halted against the yen, but the buck
sank further against the euro, the Canadian dollar and other
currencies.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks opened lower, continuing the slide that took the Dow down a
total of 248 points Monday and Tuesday. Prices had rebounded last
week, but new worries about potential terrorist attacks helped
trigger fresh selling this week.</TE>
<TE>   Though major indexes rose Wednesday, losers topped winners by 19
to 15 on Nasdaq. Winners had a modest edge on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts aren't holding much hope that the market can make
progress this week, and say selling could continue to dominate as
investors play it safe ahead of the long Memorial Day weekend. Some
of the recent terror warnings are pegged to the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "Emotions are running high. It's a reminder of the disruption that
a terrorist strike can cause not only to the public, in loss of life,
but its effects on the economy," said Barry Hyman, strategist at
Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum.</TE>
<TE>   Some nervous investors continued to seek a safe haven in gold,
driving prices to their highest level since October 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "There has definitely been more interest in gold from investors
than there has been in a long time," Sholom Sanik, a broker at money
manager Friedberg Mercantile Group in Toronto, told Bloomberg News.
"There is a portfolio shift."</TE>
<TE>   Some global investors are selling dollar-denominated assets for
gold, analysts say, reflecting fears about a possible new attack on
U.S. soil. Those sales are driving the dollar lower and other
currencies higher.</TE>
<TE>   The euro's value, for example, rose to 92.6 cents Wednesday from
92 cents Tuesday, and now is the highest since September.</TE>
<TE>   But any foreign selling of Treasury securities appears to be
offset by demand from domestic investors: The 10-year T-note yield
fell Wednesday to 5.11%, down from 5.15% Tuesday and the lowest since
May 7.</TE>
<TE>   Among Wednesday's highlights:</TE>

<HD>Mazda Narrowing Its Road to Consumers</HD>
<DH>Autos: Company says new vehicles will come, but not in
every segment of the market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Having just returned to profitability in its fiscal 2001, Mazda Motor
Co. will steadily roll out new vehicles to boost its standing in the
U.S. market, but senior executives pledged Wednesday that they no
longer will try to cover all market segments.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not going to be all things to all men. We're not big
enough," said incoming Mazda President Lewis Booth, who takes over
the reins of the Japanese auto maker next month. Booth made his first
public comments since being named Mazda's top executive; he'll
succeed Mark Fields at the end of June. The two executives met with
Wall Street analysts and the media in New York on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Mazda will discontinue its two largest cars in the U.S. market,
the $18,000 to $20,000 Mazda 626 and the flagship Millenia, which
sells for up to $32,000, and replace them with the all-new Mazda 6,
which was unveiled Monday in Japan.</LD>
<TE>   The Mazda 6 will go on sale in the U.S. in December, and will have
"the heart of a sports car," as will all Mazdas now being developed,
Booth said.</TE>
<TE>   Rival auto maker Nissan Motor Co. has been generating much of the
positive news in the Japanese auto industry lately, with Nissan's
revival plan leading to the announcement last week of a record profit
of $2.96 billion for its fiscal 2001. Nissan has nine all-new models
to hit the U.S. market in the next two years.</TE>
<TE>   Mazda turned a $71-million profit in fiscal 2001--after losing
money in three of the previous five years--but has announced just two
all-new models, the 6 and the RX-8 sports car.</TE>
<TE>   "Mazda decided not to introduce new models, while other Japanese
competitors were introducing tons of new vehicles. That was our main
concern," said Hiromichi Mizuno, a banker with Sumitomo Trust &amp;
Banking Co., one of Mazda's two main creditors.</TE>
<TE>   "The question was, how can they achieve revenue growth and net
debt reduction without new models?" said Mizuno, who attended
Wednesday's presentation. "But they did, and that's noteworthy."</TE>
<TE>   Mazda's current U.S. lineup includes the Miata, Protege sedan and
wagon, 626, Millenia, the compact pickup truck, MPV minivan and
Tribute sport utility vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   By discontinuing the Millenia, Mazda will lose a vehicle competing
against sedans such as Honda Motor Co.'s Acura TL and Toyota Motor
Corp.'s Lexus ES 300.</TE>
<TE>   "They sort of have things covered, but it's not very deep and it's
not very new. That's their problem," said Michael Flynn, head of the
Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University
of Michigan. "Mazda is getting a little bit long in the tooth, and
these days that matters in the consumer market. That's where Nissan
is doing quite well."</TE>
<TE>   Mazda is evaluating whether it will keep the pickup, at the bottom
end of its market.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not an affluent segment, it's not even a growing segment,
but it introduces people to the Mazda brand," said Charles Hughes,
president of Mazda North American Operations, based in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Booth said he will continue Mazda's "Millenium Plan" launched in
2000 to cut costs, work more closely with Ford Motor Co., which owns
a controlling share of Mazda, and launch more products, though he
would not give details about other coming models.</TE>

<HD>Music Industry to Call for a Federal Probe of Radio Payola</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beset by surging promotion costs, the music industry is planning to
call for a federal investigation into payola in the increasingly
deregulated radio business.</LD>
<LD>   Record companies and artist unions were busy Wednesday preparing a
letter to Congress and the Federal Communications Commission, urging
officials to probe questionable promotion practices by Clear Channel
Communications Inc. and other powerful radio station chains and to
drastically strengthen payola rules, which they contend are being
violated regularly.</LD>
<LD>   The letter, drafted by a coalition of trade groups including the
Recording Industry Assn. of America, is expected to be released
Friday and challenges the legality of such common practices in the
music business as independent promotion.</LD>
<TE>   It's been 40 years since the enactment of the federal payola
statute, which prohibits radio stations from accepting money for
playing songs without disclosing that information to listeners.
Record companies have gone to great lengths to avoid using such
sponsorship tags, and independent record promoters have flourished
since the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of promoters attempt to sidestep the federal anti-payola
law by paying broadcasters annual fees they say are not tied to
airplay of specific songs and then charging record labels when a song
is added to a radio station's playlist.</TE>
<TE>   Record executives have been complaining for years about the
soaring cost of promoting records to radio through intermediaries.
Since Congress deregulated the radio business in 1996, the industry
has consolidated drastically, and Clear Channel now owns about 1,225
radio stations, or 10% of U.S. stations.</TE>
<TE>   Record label executives complain that the payments to independent
promoters have swelled to an estimated $150 million annually, sources
said, but the labels' influence in getting new music on the air has
weakened.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel and Radio One Inc. infuriated record companies
recently after announcing that record labels must use designated
independent promoters to pitch songs to music programmers at their
broadcast chains.</TE>
<TE>   The record firms and various trade groups now want the government
to probe the effect of radio consolidation on the music community and
the listening public.</TE>
<TE>   "We are deeply concerned about payola and payola-like practices,
as well as the problems caused by radio station ownership
consolidation... ," said the companies and unions in a confidential
draft of the letter obtained by The Times late Wednesday. "New rules
must be written by the FCC to prohibit payments to radio stations
from 'independent promoters' unless such payments are announced."</TE>
<TE>   The unprecedented action underscores a fundamental shift of power
in the music business. A spate of mergers in recent years, the groups
contend, has moved the balance of control from the music labels to
the radio conglomerates, which have the clout to launch a song
simultaneously in scores of markets across the country--or to consign
it to oblivion.</TE>
<TE>   The letter was drafted by a coalition of groups, including the
American Federation of Musicians, the American Federation of
Television and Radio Artists and the Future of Music Coalition. None
of the organizations could be reached for comment late Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The draft letter asserts that recording artists and citizens have
been hurt by deregulation of the radio business and calls on the FCC
to better police the nation's broadcast giants, which it says have
"failed to serve the public interest." In the last four decades, the
FCC rarely has attempted to prosecute anyone for payola.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition also is demanding that Congress be more vigilant in
its oversight of the agency to "ensure that public interest is being
upheld." Specifically, the letter calls on Congress to:</TE>
<TE>   * Prohibit all payments to broadcast stations designed to
influence radio playlists, even when such intent is subtle and
disguised--especially payments made through independent promoters.</TE>
<TE>   * Closely examine how vertical integration of ownership in
broadcasting, concert promotion companies and entertainment venues
decreases "fair market competition" for artists, nightclubs and
concert promotion companies.</TE>
<TE>   A large section of the letter focuses on the escalating power of
Clear Channel, which besides owning the largest chain of radio
stations also owns the largest concert company in the world.The
letter also says that Clear Channel and other radio conglomerates
have centralized station playlists, reducing the local flavor and
limiting the diversity of music played on radio. It also alleges that
Clear Channel uses its dominant position to force acts to play in its
concert venues and at its radio station concerts. If music acts
refuse to comply, the implication is that their songs could be
blacklisted at Clear Channel stations, the group contends.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>NBC's Zucker Gets Expanded Role, Replaces Sassa</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Electric Co.'s NBC expanded the role of Entertainment
President Jeff Zucker, who has improved the network's ratings since
taking over programming in December 2000.</LD>
<LD>   NBC announced Wednesday that Zucker would take on responsibilities
over syndication and studio production now handled by West Coast
President Scott Sassa.</LD>
<LD>   Sassa's new role has yet to be determined, but NBC executives said
he will be working on strategic initiatives. NBC Chief Executive
Robert Wright said Sassa's role would be ironed out over the next two
weeks.</LD>
<TE>   "Scott wanted to defer his next role" until after the network
finished its critical May sweeps ratings period, which determines
local advertising rates and the setting of the new fall prime-time
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Wednesday, Wright and NBC President Andrew Lack
said the changes were necessary to give one person authority over
programming at the network.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeff can speak in one voice on the West Coast," said Lack, who
oversees NBC Entertainment. He said clear authority and a singular
vision was particularly important at a time when television economics
are strained.</TE>
<TE>   Zucker, 37, will keep his title at NBC Entertainment. In addition
to overseeing NBC's program lineup, he will be in charge of the
network's production studio and TV syndication unit. NBC's ratings
have risen 33% this TV season.</TE>
<TE>   Wright and Lack dismissed speculation of a continued power
struggle between them.</TE>
<TE>   "We're having our best year yet," Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   Added Lack: "We're doing fine."</TE>
<TE>   Sources inside NBC said Sassa, 44, will be focusing on improving
the performance of some new investments by the company, including
ValueVision International Inc. and Paxson Communications Corp.</TE>
<TE>   In the season starting in September, Zucker must prove he can
maintain ratings growth by nurturing new hits and finding a
replacement for "Friends," which is expected to go off the air in May
2003, media buyers have said.</TE>
<TE>   GE shares Wednesday fell 23 cents to $31.92 on the New York Stock
Exchange. They have fallen 39% in the last year.</TE>

<LD>* Shares of BioLaseTechnology Inc., a San Clemente medical and dental
laser device maker, began trading Wednesday on Nasdaq's national
market system, a move up from Nasdaq's SmallCap market. The stock,
trading under the same BLTI symbol, gained 8 cents to close at $5.35
a share.</LD>
<LD>   * Advertising spending rose just 0.41% to $23.5 billion in the
first quarter, advertising data company CMR said. Network television
advertising rose 6.2% to $5.6 billion, while cable TV advertising
fell 15.9% to $2.1 billion. Magazine advertising declined 10.6% to
$3.3 billion, and newspaper ad revenue grew 8.5% to $4.7 billion.</LD>
<LD>   * The former owner of Fingerhut Cos. and a business partner said
they're buying a portion of the catalog retailer from Federated
Department Stores Inc. in a deal that may save thousands of jobs in
Minnesota. Ted Deikel, who led Fingerhut from 1990 and oversaw its
sale to Federated in 1999, and Tom Petters said they will buy real
estate, inventory and other Fingerhut assets. They declined to say
how much they are paying.</LD>
<TE>   * MGM Mirage said it will break ground next year on a $1.5-billion
casino and hotel in Atlantic City, N.J. The projects are part of a
wave of construction in Atlantic City, where casino operators are
trying to attract more gamblers from Indian casinos in Connecticut
and elsewhere by developing glitzier, Las Vegas-style casinos.
Harrah's Entertainment Inc. on Wednesday opened a 25-story tower at
its Atlantic City casino.</TE>
<TE>   * Medtronic Inc. said profit in its fiscal fourth quarter rose 16%
to $422 million, or 34 cents a share, matching analyst estimates. The
largest maker of medical devices said sales rose 18% to $1.79
billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. said fourth-quarter net income was
virtually flat at $48 million, or 48 cents a share, as sales rose
3.3% to $556.3 million. The company also said earnings may fall short
of estimates in the next two quarters.</TE>

<HD>ImClone Chief Quits, Brother to Take Post</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ImClone Systems Inc., whose stock had tumbled to a three-year low
after failing to get its highly touted cancer drug cleared by federal
regulators, said Samuel Waksal has resigned as chief executive and
president.</LD>
<LD>   "In light of recent events and the distractions they have caused,
I am withdrawing myself from the daily operation of the company in
the confidence that ImClone Systems will be able to maintain its
focus on the advancement of our clinical development and research
programs," Waksal said.</LD>
<LD>   The biotechnology company named Waksal's brother, Harlan Waksal,
to replace him. Harlan Waskal co-founded the firm with his brother in
1985 and most recently served as chief operating officer.</LD>
<TE>   ImClone's stock had flirted with its all-time high of $78.75 last
year when Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. agreed to pay ImClone nearly $2
billion for rights to the drug--which was expected to reach the
market in mid-2003.</TE>
<TE>   But the Food and Drug Administration rejected the Erbitux
application late last year, sending ImClone's stock down as the firms
attempt to provide sufficient data for the Food and Drug
Administration. The New York-based company's shares closed up 78
cents at $10.90 on Nasdaq, before Waksal's departure was announced.</TE>
<TE>   The plan to get Erbitux to market basically returned to square one
this week, as ImClone and New York-based Bristol-Myers start new
clinical trials of the drug.</TE>

<LD>* Advertising spending rose just 0.41% to $23.5 billion in the first
quarter, advertising data company CMR said. Network television
advertising rose 6.2% to $5.6 billion, while cable TV advertising
fell 15.9% to $2.1 billion. Magazine advertising declined 10.6% to
$3.3 billion, and newspaper ad revenue grew 8.5% to $4.7 billion.</LD>
<LD>   * The former owner of Fingerhut Cos. and a business partner said
they're buying a portion of the catalog retailer from Federated
Department Stores Inc. in a deal that may save thousands of jobs in
Minnesota. Ted Deikel, who led Fingerhut from 1990 and oversaw its
sale to Federated in 1999, and Tom Petters said they will buy real
estate, inventory and other Fingerhut assets. They declined to say
how much they are paying.</LD>
<LD>   * MGM Mirage said it will break ground next year on a $1.5-billion
casino and hotel in Atlantic City, N.J. The projects are part of a
wave of construction in Atlantic City, where casino operators are
trying to attract more gamblers from Indian casinos in Connecticut
and elsewhere by developing glitzier, Las Vegas-style casinos.
Harrah's Entertainment Inc. on Wednesday opened a 25-story tower at
its Atlantic City casino.</LD>
<TE>   * ConAgra Foods Inc. said it will sell control of its feedlots and
slaughterhouses for $1.23 billion to focus on more profitable branded
foods. Buyout firm Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst Inc. and Booth Creek
Management Corp. would own 54% of a joint-venture company called
Swift &amp; Co. ConAgra would own the rest.</TE>
<TE>   * Medtronic Inc. said profit in its fiscal fourth quarter rose 16%
to $422 million, or 34 cents a share, matching analyst estimates. The
largest maker of medical devices said sales rose 18% to $1.79
billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. said fourth-quarter net income was
virtually flat at $48 million, or 48 cents a share, as sales rose
3.3% to $556.3 million. The company also said earnings may fall short
of estimates in the next two quarters.</TE>

<LD>The Bush administration will issue final rules today requiring U.S.
home air conditioners and heat pumps to be 20% more energy efficient,
rejecting a Clinton-era plan that would have further tightened energy
use .</LD>
<LD>   Environmental groups had urged the Energy Department to stick with
a Clinton administration plan for a 30% improvement in the energy
efficiency of central air conditioners and heat pumps.</LD>
<LD>   But most U.S. manufacturers argued, with success, that stricter
standards would make air conditioners more costly and put them out of
reach of low-income families. Making air conditioners more expensive
also would discourage Americans from replacing aging, less efficient
systems, they said.</LD>

<LD>A U.S. district court judge granted two of three sanction requests
against Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co., saying the company destroyed
documents that probably were pertinent to a wrongful death case
concerning tire defects.</LD>
<LD>   Two brothers, survivors of a 1998 car crash that killed their
parents and siblings, sought sanctions against Cooper for destroying
evidence as they take the company to court in a separate wrongful
death case.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. said he would allow the
plaintiffs to inform the jury in the wrongful death case that
documents were destroyed, and that the jury may infer that those
documents would have been damaging to Cooper.</LD>

<HD>Label Takes a Gamble on MP3</HD>
<DH>Music: Maverick is the first record company to embrace the
format by releasing a song from an unreleased CD.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an apparent first for a major record company, a subsidiary of
Warner Music Group plans to release a single today as an unprotected
MP3 file--a digital-music format embraced by consumers but rejected
by many labels.</LD>
<LD>   The move signals the labels' growing willingness to experiment
with online offers that fit consumers' digital lifestyles, rather
than trying to change their behavior. It's also a gamble that the
song, released without limits on copying or sharing, won't fuel
piracy.</LD>
<LD>   The single is a remixed version of the song "Earth" by Meshell
Ndegeocello, a genre-defying artist on AOL Time Warner's Maverick
Records. The company initially released a few hundred copies of the
remix on vinyl to dance-club disc jockeys, but the 99-cent MP3
version will be the only format widely available to consumers.</LD>
<TE>   Analyst P.J. McNealy of GartnerG2, a technology research and
consulting firm, praised Maverick for trying to use the popularity of
MP3s to boost the sale of Ndegeocello's new CD, which is scheduled to
hit stores next month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take experimentation like this to see if it will
work," he said. "Every other label is going to be watching this."</TE>
<TE>   Maverick hopes the single will spur interest in Ndegeocello, a
bass player and singer whose sales have dropped with each successive
release. But it's also betting that the MP3 will find a bigger market
than the downloadable singles that the five major labels have been
trying to sell, with little success.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last five years, the major labels have released
downloadable singles in a variety of copy-protected formats that
barred consumers from moving the music to their living-room stereos,
car CD players, boom boxes--anywhere, in fact, other than the
computer that downloaded it. Recent versions have promised more
flexibility, but they still were no match for the ease and
portability of CDs.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, MP3 files have become the dominant format for
downloadable music because they can be moved easily from computer to
computer, played by any digital-music software or device, and burned
onto CDs that are compatible with the vast majority of disc players.
This freedom also is the biggest drawback for labels and artists,
because MP3s can be copied easily over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, one of the main forces popularizing MP3s was the online
song-sharing service from Napster Inc., which let millions of
consumers copy songs from each others' computers without paying for
them. Although Napster's free service has since been shut down by the
federal courts, numerous other ways have emerged online to find and
copy MP3s for free.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, MP3 files are no more susceptible to piracy
than the typical CD, whose songs can easily be converted into MP3s

<TE>   Jeremy Welt, Maverick's head of new media, said releasing the
remix on MP3 was "the right thing to do for the artist, it was the
right thing to do for the song, it was the right thing to do for the
CD. There was no downside."</TE>
<TE>   DJs built an audience for the song, but it wasn't available for
sale except as a bootleg, Welt said. The MP3 release not only
provides a legitimate alternative to piracy, he said, but also
enables new, targeted promotions.</TE>
<TE>   The initial outlets will be a group of Web sites owned by Vivendi
Universal subsidiary Vivendi Universal Net USA, including EMusic.com
and MP3.com. Those sites were pioneers in offering downloadable music
in MP3 format, but until now they haven't been able to attract songs
from the major record labels.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody right now is a lot more amenable to experimentation,"
said Derrick Oien, president of VUNet USA's music and media group.
"My impression with the [major] labels is they're opening up to a lot
of different things....The thing with Maverick is a good example of
people trying to meet a halfway point or add value."</TE>
<TE>   Welt said the Ndegeocello single isn't a stunt. "This is something
we are committed to doing with many other sites" and artists willing
to take a chance on the format, he said. The main limit today, he
added, is that there aren't a lot of online retailers equipped to
deliver and promote MP3 files.</TE>

<LD>Intel Corp. will have its independent directors review the chief
executive's performance yearly as investors scrutinize how closely
boards watch their companies.</LD>
<LD>   In the past, the CEO of the world's biggest semiconductor maker
received an evaluation from his staff, Chairman Andy Grove said. "By
getting such an evaluation from the independent board members, it is
going to complete the circle," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Eight of Intel's 11 board members come from outside the company,
and those independent directors meet twice a year without management.
Each also meets with Grove to discuss the performance of the board
and company officials.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel rose 52 cents to $29.59

<DL></DL>
<LD>Deutsche Telekom reported a wider-than-expected loss in the first
quarter as earnings fell in Germany and as Europe's largest
telecommunications company wrote down the value of investments in
other countries.</LD>
<LD>   The company's sixth consecutive loss widened to $1.66 billion from
a loss of $331.3 million a year earlier. Analysts were expecting a
loss of $1.14 billion.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the big surprise of the earnings season," said Jeffrey
Currington, who helps manage about $110 billion for Pictet &amp; Cie in
London. Traditional phone service "was supposed to be the defensive
side of these companies and that has proved not to be the case."</LD>
<TE>   The Bonn-based company's shares fell as much as 8% in Europe,
valuing the company at $47.1 billion. The shares have fallen 88% from
a high reached in March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Financial Officer Karl-Gerhard Eick said the company "feels
comfortable with" operating profit forecasts of $14.7 billion to
$15.6billion this year as the company cuts costs and raises prices.</TE>

<HD>A Singular Performance by Weaver</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeff Weaver accepted pats on the back and high-fives from his
teammates after pitching a one-hitter, then smacked his hand into his
glove with a bit of disappointment, thinking about how close he came.</LD>
<LD>   Weaver took a no-hit bid into the eighth inning, leading the
Tigers over the Cleveland Indians, 2-0, Wednesday night at Detroit.</LD>
<LD>   "No-hitters are hard to come by so when you take one that deep in
the game, you're hoping for the best," Weaver said.</LD>
<TE>   Weaver held the Indians hitless until Chris Magruder, making his
debut with the Indians, doubled off the right-field wall past a
lunging Craig Paquette with two out in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Magruder and Weaver were roommates on Team USA in the 1997
Intercontinental Cup and played against each other in college.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, I won him a spot in center field," Weaver joked.</TE>
<TE>   Paquette, who was starting in the outfield for the first time this
year after playing mostly at third base, was not disappointed by his
effort on Magruder's hit.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave it my best shot," Paquette said. "It was about two feet
from going over the fence, so I was just glad it wasn't a home run."</TE>
<TE>   Weaver (4-5) struck out a season-high 11, walked two and hit two
batters in his second complete game of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver hasn't given up a homer in 71 innings this season for the
majors' longest streak since Heathcliff Slocumb went 721/3 innings to
start the 1994 season.</TE>
<TE>   A Detroit pitcher hasn't gone that long without yielding a home
run since Mark "The Bird" Fidrych went 66 innings before giving up a
home run in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 3, Seattle 2--Rookie Jason Smith hit his first home run,
and Ryan Rupe pitched six solid innings at Seattle as the Devil Rays
won their season-high fourth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The AL West-leading Mariners dropped their fourth in a row, their
first four-game losing streak since September.</TE>
<TE>   Rupe (4-5), beating Seattle for the first time in five career
decisions, broke a streak of four straight losing starts with his
first win since April 24.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 2, Boston 0--Jon Garland allowed just one baserunner over
the first eight innings and Keith Foulke rescued him in the ninth at
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a 30-13 record that is one of the best starts in franchise
history, the Red Sox open a four-game series against the Yankees
today only a game ahead of New York in the AL East.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 7, Baltimore 6--Larry Sutton hit a three-run homer at
Oakland as the A's held off the Orioles to end a four-game losing
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Sutton started for the A's in left field after the team traded
Jeremy Giambi to the Philadelphia Phillies for utility man John
Mabry.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 6, Minnesota 5--Mike Lamb, a late addition to the lineup,
hit a three-run homer and scored three times at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Lamb was playing in place of Rafael Palmeiro, out with a strained
right calf.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 8, New York 3--Carlos Delgado's bases-loaded double drove
in three runs and Eric Hinske and Raul Mondesi hit home runs at New
York as the Blue Jays ended the Yankees' six-game win streak.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Jay starter Roy Halladay (5-1) overcame early trouble,
leaving five Yankees on base in the first two innings to earn his
fourth straight victory.</TE>

<HD>Gov. Ventura Approves Stadium Deal for Twins</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Minnesota's fight to save the Twins got a big boost Wednesday when
Gov. Jesse Ventura approved a financing framework for a $330-million
ballpark.</LD>
<LD>   It caps a seven-year effort by the Twins to secure help from the
state for an open-air, natural-grass stadium. But the plan has only
lukewarm support from the Twins.</LD>
<LD>   "This bill is a huge, huge step, there's no question," said Jim
Pohlad, the eldest son of owner Carl Pohlad, who is trying to sell
the team. But with the team's ownership up in the air, Jim Pohlad
said the family isn't ready to celebrate.</LD>
<TE>   Twins' officials are unsure they'll be able to find $120 million
for a required down payment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oakland traded outfielder Jeremy Giambi to the Philadelphia
Phillies for utility man John Mabry.</TE>
<TE>   Giambi, the younger brother of Yankee first baseman Jason Giambi,
was batting .274 with eight home runs and 17 RBIs in 42 games.</TE>

<HD>'New' AVP Tackles Some Old Problems</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To know the "new" AVP is to know this: Karch Kiraly and Sinjin Smith,
longtime adversaries, are actually making nice. They will co-host a
weekly radio show this summer ... without a glass partition
separating them.</LD>
<LD>   With the glory days of the Assn. of Volleyball Professionals
fading, its players and relatively new management are aware that a
turnaround is needed for the tour to survive, taking whatever means
necessary, even if it means burying the hatchet in the sand.</LD>
<LD>   The AVP lost more than $1 million last year but it appears to be
heading toward better days, certainly an improvement over the
downcast years of the late 1990s, when AVP management made poor
decisions, overpaid its players and ultimately filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy in November 1998.</LD>
<TE>   Commissioner Leonard Armato, a beach player in the mid-1970s and
the former agent for Shaquille O'Neal, plucked the tour last May from
Spencer Trask Ventures Inc., a venture-capital firm in New York City
that gladly ditched the foundering enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   "We picked it up [in the] ER last year," Armato said. "We had to
resuscitate a dying body. It was survival."</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen whether the AVP recovery is complete. The
AVP kicks off its seven-stop tour Friday with the Huntington Beach
Open.</TE>
<TE>   On the plus side, the AVP is back on NBC for the first time since
1997, with live coverage of the Manhattan Beach and Chicago
tournaments in August.</TE>
<TE>   However, the AVP is not being paid broadcast rights fees by NBC,
which will lose the NBA after this season and this summer is
conducting an audition of sorts for lesser-known sports, including
arena football.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, Armato hopes that the national exposure will pay off.
Last year, AVP tournaments were shown solely tape-delayed on Fox
Sports Net, usually three or four weeks after actual tournament
dates.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we set ourselves and our credibility, we have a place at NBC
where we can grow," Armato said. "There's certainly the opportunity
for us if we perform well."</TE>
<TE>   But who will step forward and grow with the AVP?</TE>
<TE>   Smith retired last year at 44. Kiraly, 41, was sidelined most of
last season because of shoulder and Achilles' tendon injuries, and is
a year or two away from retirement.</TE>
<TE>   The Magic Johnson and Larry Bird of the sand, Smith and Kiraly
popularized beach volleyball with their rivalry in the late 1980s and
much of the 1990s. It is unclear who will ultimately replace them:
Parity was a trend last year, with few teams winning consistently.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it's clear right now who the next guys are," said
Kiraly, who has won a record 142 tournaments, three more than Smith.
"It's hard to catch peoples' attention if there are different teams
winning every time."</TE>
<TE>   Stein Metzger and Kevin Wong, former teammates at UCLA, appear to
have an edge on the rest of the field. The duo won the final two
tournaments last season--Santa Barbara and Manhattan Beach--and could
become the next dominant team.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what we're out to battle for," Wong said. "Who are the
next kings of the beach? Who are the next stars of our sport? There's
a vacuum there."</TE>
<TE>   There is also some lingering disharmony over which rules to play
by.</TE>
<TE>   One of Armato's first acts was to conform to the rules set by the
sport's international governing body, the FIVB, an action that
irritated some old-school players.</TE>
<TE>   For a second consecutive season, AVP matches will be rally-scored,
with a point awarded on every serve. The court will again be smaller
(about 700 square feet compared to 900 square feet) and the ball will
remain slightly larger.</TE>
<TE>   Though the format better prepares players for Olympic rules, it's
not exactly the side-out, play-until-the-sun-goes-down fun preferred
by older players.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not always sure these changes are for the better, but we're
doing it so we can all be on the same page," Kiraly said.</TE>
<TE>   On the women's side, Holly McPeak and Elaine Youngs have formed
what many expect to be a dominant team.</TE>
<TE>   McPeak and Youngs, two of the top players, were almost teammates
at UCLA--McPeak transferred from California for her senior season in
1990, but Youngs, a junior at the time, sat out the season because of
a knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   They'll finally get a chance to play together, the result of a
phone call from Youngs to McPeak during the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to be on the same side of the net with her after
competing against her all these years," McPeak said.</TE>

<HD>The Wizard of West: Kobe's Best Still Coming</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry West, who has always had a keen eye for appraising
talent--previously for the Lakers and now for the Memphis
Grizzlies--assessing Kobe Bryant in an interview with Johnette Howard
of Newsday: "He's a smiling assassin. I think he's the most skilled
player in the league, for sure.... Nothing Kobe would achieve would
surprise me. Nothing.... He's one of the most determined people I've
ever seen."</LD>
<LD>   West added that Bryant's ascent is not even close to peaking. "At
that age [23], it's like watching a precocious child. Some kids do
startling things. And you look and say, 'My goodness, what is this
person going to be when he gets older?'"</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   More Bryant: J. Freedom du Lac of the Sacramento Bee on the food
poisoning suffered by Kobe: "You can't stop [him]; you can only hope
to contaminate him."</TE>
<TE>   Tom FitzGerald of the San Francisco Chronicle, commenting on the
"killer bacon cheeseburger": "You mean to tell me that [Kobe] doesn't
have a food tester in his posse?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Tiger Woods will be seeking to win the Memorial
tournament in Dublin, Ohio, for the fourth consecutive year. Who was
the last player to win the same PGA tournament four years in a row?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dissing Sir Charles: Jerry Greene of the Orlando Sentinel suggests
some names for the upcoming hurricane season. A sampling:</TE>
<TE>   * "Hurricane Barkley--Talk about a big bag of wind.</TE>
<TE>   * "Hurricane Eldrick--A Tiger of a storm.</TE>
<TE>   "Hurricane Hardaway--Lands in Orlando and nobody cares."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dissing the East: Keith Olbermann of ABC radio: "The Nets and
Celtics couldn't beat L.A. if they merged."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pay attention: "Learn as if you're going to live forever. Live as
if you're going to die tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Some wisdom from a 91-year-old former coach. The name? John
Wooden.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1987, Seattle's Xavier McDaniel set
an opponent's playoff record against the Lakers with 20 field goals.
Nonetheless, the Lakers won, 122-121.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Avalanche of criticism: Looking back at the San Jose Sharks'
season, in the Sporting News' Caught on the Fly column: "Aside from
muttering shoulda/woulda/coulda ['We were the better team, right?
Right?'], the Sharks have a busy summer of trying to figure out what
to do with a certain free agent [and we're not talking Gary Suter].
An oh-fense lacking punch needs Teemu Selanne in a big way, but that
Game 7 disappearing act, not to mention gettin' shown up by Peter
Forsberg all series long, has San Jose suits thinking that $9 mil per
is a tad high."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Walter Hagen, who won the PGA Championship from
1924 to 1927.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: John McGrath of the Tacoma News Tribune, on Ryan
Leaf, who is trying to salvage his career with the Seattle Seahawks:
"Consider the irony: [Leaf] had everything a pro athlete could need
but discipline and direction. When he matured to the point he
actually decided to watch his weight in the off-season, he learned a
most precious mechanism--the wrist on his throwing hand--had
sustained damage that accurately might be called irreparable."</TE>

<HD>Das Succeeding at His Dual Role</HD>
<DH>Junior is unbeaten for Division II semifinalist Troy and
alive in section singles tournament</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAUREN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a dual-match day like every other in the high school tennis
career of Jeffrey Das. He did not lose.</LD>
<LD>   Das, a junior at Fullerton Troy High, swept his three sets against
Rio Mesa on Tuesday, helping the Warriors win on games, 76-71, after
they tied, 9-9, in sets.</LD>
<LD>   He is undefeated in dual-match sets (48-0) entering Troy's
Southern Section Division II semifinal match today at Santa Barbara.</LD>
<TE>   "I really didn't expect to be undefeated," Das said. "I just
wanted to do well for the team and win as many matches as I could."</TE>
<TE>   Das is also competing in the section's individual tournament. He
has advanced to the round of 16, which will be played Friday at the
SeaCliff Tennis Club in Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I'm playing really well right now," he said. "I'm
hoping to get to the final, but I know it's going to be tough. All
the players are really tops, but I feel like I'm on that level now."</TE>
<TE>   Among his impressive victories was a 6-4 triumph over last year's
Southern Section singles runner-up, Patrick Buchanan of Servite, and
a 7-6 (1) victory over Corona del Mar's Cameron Ball.</TE>
<TE>   "He's by far our best player," Coach George Vallance said of Das.
"He's solid. He very seldom has a bad game. He may have a bad point,
but not a bad game."</TE>
<TE>   That has been fortunate for Troy (25-1), which has won 20
consecutive matches since losing to Corona del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been able to count on him," said Troy captain Andrew Jan,
the team's only senior.</TE>
<TE>   "We're always playing tough matches, and with him going 3-0,
there's always an opportunity for us to win."</TE>
<TE>   Das hasn't been perfect this season. He did lose to Irvine
University's Aaron Yovan by a 10-8 margin in a super-tiebreaker third
set of match play in the round of 16 last month at the Ojai Valley
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Das also lost to Jamil Al-Agba of Camarillo in three sets after
winning the first set in the round of 32 at the U.S. Tennis Assn.
Easter Bowl/Super National Championships in Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the losses, Das said he was happy with his play in both
tournaments because he has moved from the boys' 16 division to 18s
this year. He has been re-tooling his game, trying to improve his
serve-and-volley play, come to the net from the baseline and mix up
his shots more.</TE>
<TE>   Das and Troy will try to extend their seasons beyond what they
accomplished last year, when Das lost in the round of 16 to eventual
champion Doug Stewart in the individual tournament and the Warriors
fell in the semifinals to Irvine Woodbridge.</TE>
<TE>   Das' play this season has helped steady a squad that includes
three freshmen.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the backbone of our team," Vallance said. "He works hard at
his game, he plays all the time, and he's gotten a lot stronger."</TE>

<LD>It's probably a longshot, but Tiger Woods is getting ready for the
U.S. Open and the second part of what could be a Grand Slam. Off the
course, Woods rightly downplays talk of the Grand Slam, but on the
course, he seems to be doing a fairly good job of preparing for it.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday in Germany, he won the SAP Deutsche Bank tournament in a
playoff with Colin Montgomerie and today he begins defense of his
title at the Memorial in Dublin, Ohio, where he is the three-time
defending champion.</LD>
<LD>   Woods leads the PGA Tour in its three most important
categories--scoring average (68.84), earnings ($3,011,900) and
victories (two).</LD>
<TE>   This is a busy time for Woods, who is playing for the third
consecutive week. There has been speculation he would add the Kemper
to his schedule next week, then skip the Buick Classic, which is the
week before the June 13-16 Open.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Woods played the Buick Classic at Westchester Country
Club, but it followed the Open at Southern Hills. Woods usually does
not play the week before a major.</TE>
<TE>   There already is speculation building on possible contenders in
the Open at Bethpage Black, with Woods drawing even more than the
usual interest, if that's possible. But he's not alone.</TE>
<TE>   To begin with, don't discount Retief Goosen, the defending
champion, who has sent notice that his game is together. And after
getting off to a hot start and then cooling off, Ernie Els appears to
be back with a tie for fourth at the Nelson.</TE>
<TE>   Vijay Singh missed the cut at the Nelson, but the tied for 12th at
the Colonial, was seventh at the Masters and won at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   The longshots are many, but to name two, how about Nick Price and
Kenny Perry. Price's victory at the Colonial was his first in four
years. And with the flat greens at Bethpage, you don't have to putt
like a maniac to win, which ought to help Price--and many others,
probably.</TE>
<TE>   As for Perry, he's the 16th-ranked player in the world and almost
nobody knows it. Perry has two seconds and a third this year and has
won $1.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Zagat on Golf</TE>
<TE>   You probably have heard of Zagat, the noted restaurant guide that
uses feedback from diners to critique the eateries it surveys. Zagat
has announced plans for a Zagat guide on golf courses that will be
out in November.</TE>
<TE>   If you are familiar with Zagat, this is how Riviera might fare:</TE>
<TE>   For "people who live to play," "Riviera's reputation" (both the
history and the Pacific Palisades layout) stretches farther than John
Daly hits his driver, thanks to a novel "user-friendly" approach that
lets you "mix and match" clubs to hit into the "nouvelle George
Thomas" greens. (Hint: "Don't miss the sixth hole with the doughnut

you find your "beautifully dimpled" golf ball after it is "infused"

be saying, "I'd be here weekly if I could afford it."</TE>

<TE>   Mr. Europe</TE>
<TE>   You have to say that John Daly is a traveling kind of guy, looking

the defending champion. Last year, Daly set the 2001 European Tour
record with a 27-under par at Golf Club Munched Ford-Eichenried.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, after a quick start, Daly is slipping a little over
here on the PGA Tour. He has played 11 events and has two fourths--at
Phoenix and at Torrey Pines--but hasn't finished better than a tie
for 15th since.</TE>

<HD>Security Tightens at the Brickyard</HD>
<DH>Auto racing: Sunday's Indianapolis 500 will be contested
with throngs of law enforcement personnel in place.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ED HINTON</AU>
<BD>TRIBUNE MOTOR SPORTS WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>With more than 300,000 people at one event, in a week when federal
authorities are on heightened alert for terrorism in the U.S.,
security will be a huge and complex matter for Sunday's Indianapolis
500.</LD>
<LD>   More federal, state and local law enforcement officers will be in
place than at the U.S. Grand Prix at Indianapolis on Sept. 30, when
police were increased by more than 1,000. And that crowd was "only"
about 200,000 because of a different seating configuration for road
racing and European and Latin American fans' fears of coming to the
U.S. in the aftermath of Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   Massive as the plans are for Sunday, "many of our efforts have and
will go unnoticed, and that is the intended purpose," said Jeff Dine,
chairman of the Law Enforcement Safety Group, a conglomerate of
police forces from the FBI to local, which coordinates security for
races at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.</LD>
<TE>   Dine is chief of police of the town of Speedway, Ind., the suburb
that surrounds the track.</TE>
<TE>   But when you've hosted the world's largest one-day sports crowds
for half a century, as the Speedway has, security and disaster
contingency plans are far from new.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, the Indiana State Police estimated crowds for the
500 at up to 400,000.</TE>
<TE>   Police and rescue operations have long been in place for such
possibilities as tornadoes ripping through the most expansive
grandstands in the world, or shrapnel from race crashes flying into
spectator areas.</TE>
<TE>   Area hospitals on race days--the 500 each May, the NASCAR
Brickyard 400 each August, and the Grand Prix each September--are
prepared to attend to casualties in the thousands, just in case.</TE>
<TE>   And no crowd-control force has a keener, more experienced sixth
sense for spotting troublemakers. Imagine four to five Super Bowl
crowds in one place on the same day, and that's Indy. It has been
calculated that eight major-league ballparks would fit into the
infield here.</TE>
<TE>   Indy's security system "has been refined during the past 30 years,
and it has been copied and applied at other large venues around the
country," Dine said.</TE>
<TE>   "Federal, state and local agencies all work together seamlessly
here, and all have reviewed and updated procedures in light of our
nation's heightened state of alert."</TE>
<TE>   Indy's first highest-level alert for international terrorism came
in 1991, when Vice President Dan Quayle and Gen. Colin Powell, then
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, visited the 500 with Mideast
tensions still high in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, not only will all vehicles entering the infield be subject
to inspection, as at NASCAR races, but Speedway security will conduct
periodic sweeps of parked vehicles throughout race day.</TE>
<TE>   Spectators entering through pedestrian gates will be subject to
search of all coolers, backpacks and handbags, with uniformed police,
rather than ticket-takers, supervising the inspections.</TE>
<TE>   Speedway President Tony George has appealed to spectators to
arrive earlier than usual--which may be tough to do, considering that
historically, when the gates open at 5 a.m., traffic is already at a
standstill for miles in every direction on highways and surface
streets leading to the Speedway.</TE>

Security Blanket
Among the measures apparent to those attending the "500" are:
* Strict enforcement of rules limiting any coolers carried in to no
more than 14 inches wide by 14 inches high
* All coolers, backpacks and handbags will be subject to security
inspection at the gates of the Speedway
* Additional uniformed officers will be stationed at each gate to
monitor inspections
* All infield parking will be directed to posted areas, and all
vehicles are subject to inspection. Periodic sweeps of parking areas
will be carried out by security
* A number of other measures will be employed on the grounds to
tighten security during the week of the race and on race day, but
details will not be released

<HD>Belmont Possible for Pincay</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laffit Pincay Jr., replaced by Jerry Bailey on Medaglia d'Oro in the
Preakness Stakes after riding the colt in his three previous races,
may end up having a mount in what could be a historic Belmont Stakes
on June 8.</LD>
<LD>   The world's winningest jockey is the regular rider of Like A Hero,
a 3-year-old son of Pleasant Colony who could make his graded stakes
debut when War Emblem goes for the Triple Crown in the Belmont.</LD>
<LD>   Whether Like A Hero heads to New York depends on what happens in
the $75,000 Alydar Stakes today at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<TE>   If Like A Hero, who has won two of three, beats four opponents in
the 11/8-mile race, trainer Beau Greely and owner-breeder Andrea
Pollack, who races as Columbine Stable, may decide to try the
Belmont. At 11/2 miles, it is the longest of the Triple Crown races.
With his pedigree--his mother, Like A Hawk, is a daughter of Silver
Hawk--Like A Hero would seemingly be suited to the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "The Belmont is a possibility," Greely said Wednesday morning. "If
he wins [today], it is definitely an option and we'll discuss it and
go from there."</TE>
<TE>   After narrowly missing with a furious late rally in his debut at
seven furlongs on Feb. 18, Like A Hero has won twice around two
turns.</TE>
<TE>   The heavy favorite in both races at Santa Anita, he was not
particularly impressive but got the job done. He did overcome some
trouble on each occasion and looks like a colt who will improve with
experience.</TE>
<TE>   Idle since defeating Golden Hare by a nose on April 19, Like A
Hero has trained well at Hollywood Park, where he is stabled, and
Greely says he is maturing.</TE>
<TE>   "The Pleasant Colony [horses] always take a little time to
develop," he said. "He's a big, long horse who was slow developing,
but there's a huge difference between his first race and now. He's
acting more like a race horse. He knows what he's doing.</TE>
<TE>   "He worked seven furlongs in 1:274/5 [on May 12] and went the
final five-eighths in 1:00 flat. He's doing very well and he should
be awfully tough [this afternoon]."</TE>
<TE>   One of Like A Hero's foes in the Alydar also may have designs on
the Belmont. Azillion has been mentioned as a possible should he
prevail today for trainer Bob Hess Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Azillion has yet to win in this country. He is best known for his
neck loss to Perfect Drift--who returned to finish third in the
Kentucky Derby and is also headed to the Belmont--in the Spiral
Stakes at Turfway Park on March 23.</TE>

<LD>After the first 21 days of Hollywood Park's spring-summer meet,
Vladimir Cerin is tied for second with Bobby Frankel in the trainer
standings.</LD>
<LD>   They both have seven victories, one fewer than leader Jerry
Dutton.</LD>
<LD>   By the end of this afternoon, Cerin could have the lead.</LD>
<TE>   While Frankel and Dutton have no starters, Cerin is scheduled to
run Rich Musique in the fifth and Country By Nature in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by David and Holly Wilson, who have had major success with
such claims as Early Pioneer and Designed For Luck with Cerin, Rich
Musique will be a longshot in the 51/2-furlong turf sprint, but her
speed makes her dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   After chasing recent Railbird Stakes winner September Secret on
April 17, Rich Musique, a 3-year-old Rizzi filly, will appreciate
softer competition as she makes her first start on turf.</TE>
<TE>   In the sixth, a $32,000 maiden claimer at six furlongs, Country By
Nature is the likely favorite as he drops from the $50,000 level.</TE>
<TE>   Like Rich Musique, Country By Nature will be ridden by David
Flores. He will break from the rail.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day, many eyes will be focused on Bay Meadows when
Exzacta Max tries for the third time to break her maiden.</TE>
<TE>   Owned in part by local syndicated handicapper Jack Karlik, the
3-year-old Native Prospector filly will be ridden by Jason Lumpkins
as she runs in the seventh after finishing fourth and sixth in two
starts at Santa Anita and Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Turkish Prize, second to Adminniestrator in the
Quicken Tree Stakes last month, and San Juan Capistrano also-ran
Speedy Pick head the field in the seventh at Hollywood Park, a
11/4-mile race on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Patrick Valenzuela. A second consecutive appearance in
this spot after he rode four more winners Wednesday at Hollywood
Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Jose Espinoza. Victor's brother got off to a 1-for-31
start at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Boozin' Susan, Pina Colada
and Anima Mundi in the fifth, singling Country By Nature in the
sixth, and Complete Class, Somethingdangerous and Turkish Prize in
the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/51. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $18.40/$290.60. Total money bet: $362.</TE>

<KH>NBA PLAYOFFS SACRAMENTO VS. LAKERS SERIES REPORT/KING NOTES</KH>
<HD>Pollard Holds Court About Facing Shaq</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Backup center Scot Pollard reclined in a courtside chair at the
Kings' practice facility as a group of reporters surrounded him,
searching for nuggets of information on Day 2 of the three-day layoff
between Games 2 and 3.</LD>
<LD>   "Blah, blah, blah," Pollard said, smiling broadly to make it clear
he was in a jovial mood Wednesday afternoon. "I just want to play
basketball. I don't care what the Lakers say. I think we should play
every day with no media exposure."</LD>
<LD>   Soon enough, the conversation turned to stopping Laker center
Shaquille O'Neal, who scored 35 points Monday in Game 2 against
Pollard and Vlade Divac. Pollard grew slightly more serious about his
answers.</LD>
<TE>   "You have to use your fouls wisely," he said. "You have to throw
different looks at him. You have to be active. You have to try to
make him confused, so he's worried about the defense instead of just
catching the ball and dunking on your head."</TE>
<TE>   As ever, defending O'Neal was a topic of much discussion.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm satisfied, but I'm not happy with the job Scot and I did,"
Divac said. "Shaq is going to get his points. We changed our coverage
on him in the second half. We double-teamed him in the second half.
People thought Scot and I did a great job on him. Sometimes you can't
stop everyone."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal has made it clear he doesn't like the way Divac flops to
the floor after the slightest contact. But it was clear from O'Neal's
third foul in Game 2 that Divac hits the deck with good reason on
occasion--this time it was an elbow to the jaw.</TE>
<TE>   "He can call me whatever he wants," Divac said of O'Neal. "I don't
pay attention. He can call me this and that. I'll do whatever I can
to win. I'm not going to hurt him. I'm trying to play him. I
understand he doesn't feel everything because he is so big. When he
turns, his elbows are high. I'm trying to sacrifice my body in order
to win."</TE>
<TE>   After scoring 23 points on 11-for-15 shooting in the first half,
O'Neal went to the bench after drawing his third foul with 4 minutes
49 seconds remaining in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Rick Adelman groaned when relayed Laker Coach Phil Jackson's
complaints Tuesday about the refereeing in Game 2 at Arco Arena.
Adelman dismissed Jackson's comments as mere gamesmanship in the wake
of the Lakers' 96-90 loss to the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's posturing," Adelman said. "You vocalize things to the NBA,
not to the media. There were some things we didn't like after the
first game and we talked to the league. It comes down to the fact
that anybody who plays against Shaq probably thinks they're at a
disadvantage.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it's like, 'Get a life.' They're good enough. They're the
world champions. They shouldn't be worried about the refs."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Swingman Peja Stojakovic continues to improve, albeit slowly, from
the sprained right ankle that has sidelined him since May 9. He did
some light jogging and reported his ankle is still "sore and
painful."</TE>

<KH>NBA PLAYOFFS SACRAMENTO VS. LAKERS SERIES REPORT/LAKER NOTES</KH>
<HD>George, Fisher Need to Improve</HD>

<LD>Small forward Devean George has become a key role player for the
Lakers and even though against Sacramento he has missed several open
shots that he's capable of making, George understands where he helps
his team the most.</LD>
<LD>   "No matter what, if I'm making shots or missing shots, I still
have to go down on the other end and play defense," said George, who
will be an unrestricted free agent this summer.</LD>
<LD>   "Getting buckets and scoring is good, but my role is to play with
energy and give the team defense. I also need to run the floor and
[give the Lakers fresh legs] out there."</LD>
<TE>   Getting a few easy baskets in transition may help George's
shooting touch. Although his field-goal percentage of .462 (six for
13) in the first two games of the series is not bad, George knows
that he can give the Lakers a boost if his shooting improves.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can do is keep shooting until I find my rhythm," George
said. "Once I get that back, I'll start making those shots again."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Derek Fisher stepped up in a big way with his
three-point shooting in last season's playoff run. But Fisher has had
a difficult time getting similar shots this postseason.</TE>
<TE>   In 10 playoff games, Fisher is shooting 32.6% from the field and
has made only two of 10 three-point attempts against the Kings. Coach
Phil Jackson said Tuesday that Fisher needs to let his offense come
to him.</TE>
<TE>   "I can knock down shots when they are there, but teams have made
adjustments," Fisher said. "They have seen the development in my game
and they are not allowing me the same shots that I've gotten before."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento is unbeaten in four road playoff games, and the Kings
have won 16 of their last 18 games away from Arco Arena. Jackson, who
questioned the Kings' ability to win on the road two months ago, gave
Sacramento Coach Rick Adelman's team credit for its recent play.</TE>
<TE>   "They proved they can win on the road," Jackson said. "They did it
through some really good team play and some situations where they
didn't have some starters."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson was referring to Chris Webber, Bobby Jackson and Hedo
Turkoglu, who missed some of the Kings' regular-season road wins
because of minor injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The last time Sacramento lost on the road was against the Lakers,
who defeated the Kings, 109-95, in the last game of the regular
season. The Kings are 1-10 against the Lakers at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal, who did not talk to reporters Wednesday, looked
fit in practice, showing little sign of the injuries that have nagged
him throughout the playoffs. Jackson said the Laker center played his
best basketball of the postseason in Game 2 but was not pleased with
O'Neal's missed free throws in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, he didn't get his free throws to go down," Jackson
said about O'Neal, who is shooting 52.9% from the line against the
Kings and 62.5% in the playoffs.</TE>

<LD>Anybody who started a place parlay with Shescape on March 21 has a
nice return on their investment right now.</LD>
<LD>   Shescape, a 4-year-old Candyman Bee filly trained by Charles
Treece for owners Eric Swain and Anthony Gray Jr., has been the
runner-up three consecutive times.</LD>
<LD>   She began her streak when two lengths behind Bay Wave as the 7-5
favorite on the night she was claimed by her current connections.
Brought back a month later, she was second again, losing by a nose as
the 4-5 favorite to Heads Or Tails Hal.</LD>
<TE>   On May 3, she completed the exacta once more, missing by a neck to
Just A Berry at 5-2 odds.</TE>
<TE>   Shescape will try to break through with her third career victory
and second of the current Los Alamitos meet in tonight's sixth, a
41/2-furlong race for $2,000 fillies and mares.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Real Mirage. 2. Vising. 3. Heza Quick Dash. 4.
Riggin Lady. 5. One Big Love. 6. Shescape. 7. Shell Ha. 8. Firm
Investment.</TE>
<TE>   Four! In the first, single Real Mirage; use Vising and FC Star
Trek in the second; Heza Quick Dash, Jjackson Champus and Strawflying
Six in the third; and Riggin Lady, Silky Goose and Flores Wild Cat in
the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Royal Centenario is a firster in the fifth
debuting in a weak race for a winning barn (Adan Farias). Shania Fame
will get Lasix and is back in with maidens in the seventh after
chasing Lonely Moon Sign in a trial for the Kindergarten.</TE>
<TE>   Post time: 7:15 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Ordering Out? Then It's Gut-Check Time</HD>

<LD>Rick Majerus, Utah basketball coach, will be The Times' guest analyst
on the Lakers for the rest of the playoffs. Majerus, the fourth-
winningest active coach in major college basketball, will begin his
14th season at Utah this fall. He will donate his honorarium for this
column to two charities: Padua Village group homes in Claremont and
the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   The food poisoning that slowed Kobe Bryant, and still seemed to be
bothering him Wednesday, illustrates his only real weakness as a
player in the NBA. And it is a weakness that I, perhaps better than
anyone, am qualified to coach him on.</LD>
<LD>   That weakness, of course, is inexperience in ordering room
service.</LD>
<TE>   This is not something that should be taken lightly, that should be
dismissed without weighing things carefully. As they say in boxing, I
may be the best, pound for pound, in all of sports at this.</TE>
<TE>   That's why there are team managers. Mine has a standing order to
report to my hotel room at 2 a.m. on the road to see what I want to
eat. There is never a question of if, only what. I'm watching film.
That brings hunger. Matter of fact, not watching film also brings
hunger.</TE>
<TE>   Now, of course, I don't ask the manager to do a taste test first.
That would be cruel.</TE>
<TE>   But he has a pretty good sense of smell and has some pretty good
instincts. Plus, his job security isn't good if the coach gets food
poisoning. That's kind of understood.</TE>
<TE>   I usually send him someplace else, outside the hotel. Aren't there
any Fatburgers in Sacramento, Kobe?</TE>
<TE>   A good rule is to never order room service after midnight ... it's
mystery meat and secret sauce.</TE>
<TE>   I've seen lots of late-night plates with things on them that
looked like, well ... think of long, flat Texas roads and armadillos.
After all, there are lots and lots of wide-open roads around
Sacramento not more than five miles from that hotel where Kobe
stayed.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, I'm not accusing anybody of intentionally trying to
poison Kobe, but I've been around enough to know that once you are in
those hotels, they know who you are and that you are there. Kobe
could register as K.B. or something, but every bellman and doorman
and room clerk in the place would know he was in Room 321.</TE>
<TE>   Again, I'm not saying that anybody intentionally poisoned Kobe,
but they knew who he was and where he was and Sacramento is a town
wild and crazy over this team. So all I'm saying is that he probably
didn't get the prime-A cut.</TE>
<TE>   We've got Robert's Rules of Order for parliamentary procedure and
we should have Majerus' Methods of Menus for sports room service.
Remember my qualifications here: I've had seven bypasses, one for
each food group.</TE>
<TE>   Let's review:</TE>
<TE>   * When in doubt, Fatburger is probably your best bet.</TE>
<TE>   * Have a minion order for you. The Lakers have to have lots of
those.</TE>
<TE>   * If it is after midnight and you have to order from the hotel
kitchen, get an affidavit as to animal type and send it back if it
moves on the plate.</TE>
<TE>   And let's add one more, not previously mentioned, but a personal
favorite: Never eat anything green. Think about it. Has Shaq ever
said the reason for his success is broccoli? Of course not.</TE>
<TE>   One thing I couldn't quite understand about Kobe's stomachache. He
is a hard-muscled, in-perfect-shape basketball player slowed by a
stomachache? A guy like that doesn't even have a stomach. Now if it
were me or Lasorda or Simers, it's a different deal.</TE>
<TE>   Now those would be stomachaches.</TE>

<HD>Celtics, Nets Seek Some Consistency</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New Jersey Nets and Boston Celtics have three days to ponder the
ugly-beautiful nature of their series so far.</LD>
<LD>   Game 1 had an up-tempo flow that was pleasing to the eye--and to
the Nets.</LD>
<LD>   Game 2 was much more to the Celtics' liking, even if it might have
been an eyesore to anyone who watched the teams miss a combined 138
shots.</LD>
<TE>   "They came to do a job, they got a game and now they have home
court," New Jersey's Jason Kidd said. "The series is tied. We knew it
was going to be a series."</TE>
<TE>   Game 3 is Saturday at Boston, and Game 4 is Monday.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most puzzling problems, however, for the Celtics is
Paul Pierce's suddenly lost shooting touch.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA's third-leading scorer shot only three for 20 from the
field in Game 2 and has made only three three-pointers in the two
games.</TE>
<TE>   An 81% free-throw shooter during the regular season, he has
already missed 15 free throws in two games.</TE>
<TE>   If the two games can be broken down into one intangible factor, it
would be intensity.</TE>
<TE>   Boston played with an urgency in Game 2, New Jersey with a sense
of complacency. The Celtics were the ones diving for loose balls and
deflecting passes.</TE>
<TE>   If form holds, the team showing the most hustle will come out of
Game 3 with a 2-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "They saw defense. The first game they didn't see any defense,"
Boston's Kenny Anderson said. "This is how the series is going to be
now. This is our type of basketball. Let's see how they respond."</TE>
<TE>   Boston is 5-0 at the Fleet Center in the playoffs, and the Nets
have gone 2-2 on the road. New Jersey has not lost consecutive games
in this postseason.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Turner Sports' ratings for the NBA playoffs were up 9% this season
and even more in key demographic groups.</TE>
<TE>   For 36 games, TBS and TNT averaged a 2.5 rating compared to last
year's 2.3 for the same number of games. The ratings among men 18-34,
the demographic networks covet most, were up 16%. Ratings among all
people 18-34 were up 14% and men 18-49 were up 14%.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Guard Speedy Claxton of the Philadelphia 76ers had arthroscopic
surgery on his left shoulder and will be ready for the start of next
season. Claxton, a second-year guard who missed his rookie year
because of a knee injury, tore a muscle in his left shoulder late in
the regular season.... Houston Rocket forward Terence Morris was
arrested on charges of speeding and driving with a suspended license
in Charles Town, W.Va. Morris, who police said was driving 76 mph in
a 60 mph zone, posted a $385 cash bond and was released, court
records show. A hearing is set for June 5.</TE>

<HD>Detroit Adds Another Name to the Marquee</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Olausson, overshadowed by All-Star teammates, is
Game 3 hero with an overtime goal in Red Wings' 2-1 victory over
Avalanche.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Another unsung hero came through for the Detroit Red Wings.</LD>
<LD>   Fredrik Olausson scored his first playoff goal in 10 years at
12:44 of overtime as the Red Wings beat the Colorado Avalanche, 2-1,
Wednesday night to take a 2-1 lead in the Western Conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   After relying on its marquee players in the first two rounds of
the playoffs, Detroit's lesser-known players have come through
against the defending Stanley Cup champions.</LD>
<TE>   Darren McCarty scored three straight goals in the third period of
Game 1, a 5-3 Detroit victory, after scoring only five during the
regular season. Kirk Maltby and Boyd Devereaux, who had one goal
between them in the first two rounds, both scored for Detroit in Game
2.</TE>
<TE>   "Colorado is playing great defense. They don't give you much
room," Olausson said. "Sometimes opportunities present themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Olausson took advantage of his, beating Patrick Roy from just
inside the blue line on a shot that appeared to hit Colorado
defenseman Martin Skoula in the leg.</TE>
<TE>   Dominik Hasek, who made 20 saves, set up the goal by clearing a
loose puck to Steve Yzerman at center ice. Yzerman found Olausson,
who scored his first playoff goal since April 18, 1992, for Winnipeg
against Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Patrick saw it when I shot it, and it might have
surprised him a little bit," said Olausson.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado struggled defensively and only made it to overtime
because Roy stopped 40 shots.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche played physical seven-game series against the Kings
and San Jose in the first two rounds of the playoffs, but Coach Bob
Hartley became angered when asked if his team was tired.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the worst excuse in the book," Hartley said. "I don't
even want to hear until the end of the playoffs the word fatigue.
This is for losers."</TE>
<TE>   The series was touted as a showdown between the league's two best
goalies, but it was far from that in the first two games as the teams
combined for 15 goals.</TE>
<TE>   Game 3 was more of what everyone expected, with Roy and Hasek
trading spectacular saves.</TE>
<TE>   Hasek faced 21 fewer shots than Roy (42-21), but was still solid
after allowing seven goals in the first two games.</TE>
<TE>   Roy, who kicked a puck into his own net in Game 2, stopped Brendan
Shanahan on a one-timer from close range midway through the first
period, then made a kick save on a redirected shot by Olausson in the
second.</TE>
<TE>   Roy also squeezed his pads around a rebound attempt by Sergei
Fedorov late in the second, and stopped another shot by Fedorov in
the third despite being screened by two players.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's pretty clear that Patrick almost stole a game that
we had no business being in," Hartley said. "He gave us every chance
possible to go home with a victory we didn't deserve."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Pat Quinn remained hospitalized Wednesday with an irregular heartbeat
as the Toronto Maple Leafs prepared to go at least one more game of
the Eastern Conference finals without their coach behind the bench.</LD>
<LD>   "He's undergoing more tests and he will remain in the hospital
until his heart is in regular rhythm for a long enough period of time
that doctors believe it will remain in regular rhythm," Maple Leaf
President Ken Dryden said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Dryden said Quinn could be released from the hospital as soon as
today, but that it's "highly unlikely" Quinn will coach Game 4 in
Toronto tonight and that he's "unlikely" for Game 5 Saturday in
Carolina.</LD>
<TE>   If a Game 6 is needed on Tuesday night, Dryden said it's "highly
probable" Quinn would be back.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as the rhythm becomes stabilized, then basically you can
go back and do what you were doing," Dryden said doctors told him.</TE>

<TE>   Ed Belfour, coming off the worst of his five seasons with the
Dallas Stars, won't be re-signed by the team.</TE>
<TE>   Star General Manager Doug Armstrong said his club will not pursue
Belfour when the veteran goaltender becomes an unrestricted free
agent July 1.</TE>
<TE>   The Stars' decision to let Belfour go means Marty Turco will get
his shot at being the team's No. 1 goaltender.</TE>
<TE>   "Like anything in life, there are times you have to move on,"
Armstrong said. "We feel it's time to give [Turco] an opportunity to
take a bigger role in this organization."</TE>
<TE>   Belfour, 37, led the Stars to the Stanley Cup in 1999 and is the
club's winningest goalie.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, the Stars signed former goaltender Andy Moog as an
assistant to new Coach Dave Tippett. Moog signed a three-year
contract.</TE>
<TE>   The 42-year-old Moog played 713 NHL games for Edmonton, Boston,
Dallas and Montreal before retiring after the 1997-98 season. *</TE>
<TE>   Craig Hartsburg, who coached the Mighty Ducks and Chicago
Blackhawks for six seasons, was rehired as an assistant coach by the
Philadelphia Flyers.</TE>
<TE>   Hartsburg was the Ontario Hockey League's coach of the year this
season after his Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds improved by 33 points
from last season. He was the Flyers' assistant head coach in the
early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Hartsburg had a 184-190-69 record in three seasons with the
Blackhawks (1995-98) and three seasons with the Ducks (1998-2001).</TE>

<HD>No Warm Greeting for Israel</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Rogge says he'll reject bid to expel nation from
IOC. Malaysian officials shun welcoming ceremony.Rogge says he will
reject Iranian bid to expel nation from IOC and Malaysian officials
don't attend welcome.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia</DL>
<LD>As the curtain rose on a meeting of 199 Olympic committees from
around the globe, the president of the International Olympic
Committee on Wednesday indicated he would reject a bid from Iranian
officials--irate at hostilities in the Middle East--to expel Israel
from the session and from the IOC.</LD>
<LD>   Meantime, because of the Israeli presence at the meeting, senior
officials in the Malaysian government--which, like several nations
with a strong Islamic tradition, does not formally recognize Israel's
existence--did not take part in the traditional ceremonial welcome at
the start of the session.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli passport holders were grudgingly admitted into Malaysia on
special visas only after pressure from leading Olympic officials, it
was disclosed. Moreover, the Israeli flag did not hang from the
ceiling of the grand ballroom at the Mandarin Oriental hotel--while
the flags of all other Olympic committees, including a Palestinian
flag, fluttered above the gathering.</LD>
<TE>   The events Wednesday served to illuminate the uneasy intersection
of politics and sport.</TE>
<TE>   "This belongs in the United Nations and other high political
bodies, not the sports world," said Pal Schmitt, an IOC member for
nearly 20 years who serves as Hungary's ambassador to Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not an issue we should enter into," said R. Kevan Gosper
of Australia, the IOC's ranking vice president. "We're here for
sport."</TE>
<TE>   The rhetoric from some quarters Wednesday was sharp and the
symbolism impossible to ignore as the Assn. of National Olympic
Committee session--held every two years--began.</TE>
<TE>   At the last meeting, in Rio de Janeiro in May 2000, Israeli and
Palestinian delegates argued in the halls. The issue then was whether
the Sydney Games that year ought to include a memorial to the 11
Israeli athletes and officials kidnapped and murdered by Palestinian
terrorists at the 1972 Munich Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks ago, the president of Iran's Olympic committee,
Mostafa Hashemi Taba, wrote IOC President Jacques Rogge, urging the
IOC's ruling executive board to keep the Israelis from the Kuala
Lumpur meeting and then expel them from the IOC.</TE>
<TE>   He said the letter did not have the official backing of Iran's
government.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why he sent such a letter on behalf of Iran's Olympic
establishment, he told reporters, "One of the most important roles of
the IOC is making peace around the world. With genocide you cannot
make peace. Now Israel makes genocide."</TE>
<TE>   Zaher Akram, assistant secretary general of the Palestinian
Olympic committee, said in the room, "For me, it's not a big
problem." But he added, "You know, if the IOC decided to cut Israel
out of the IOC, that would be good."</TE>
<TE>   When told of the Iranian Hashemi's remarks, Rogge issued a
statement acknowledging receipt of the letter and saying it would be
forwarded "in due course" to the executive board, which meets here
later in the week. He added, "This doesn't mean the IOC will change
its position. The IOC has always had a policy of not letting politics
interfere with sport."</TE>
<TE>   It had been rumored for months that Israeli passport holders might
not gain visas for entry to Malaysia. When such rumors gained
credibility, Mexico's Mario Vazquez Rana, president of the Assn. of
National Olympic Committees and also a member of the IOC executive
board, said he had recently sent a strongly worded letter to
Malaysian officials. A principle was at stake, he said--all Olympic
committees in good standing ought to take part.</TE>
<TE>   "I am daring to take the delegates from Israel in my own plane [to
the meeting]," Vazquez Rana said Wednesday, recounting the letter.</TE>
<TE>   Kuala Lumpur bid unsuccessfully for the 2008 Summer Games, and
bids for future Games are sure to be forthcoming. The head of
Malaysia's Olympic committee, Prince Tunku Imran, sought to downplay
the issue of the visas, saying, "They understand as the Malaysian
government that if they want to be involved in international events
like the Olympics, the rule is everyone gets in."</TE>
<TE>   When the conference opened, however, no Malaysian dignitaries but
Imran were on hand. The head of a host nation's government or the
country's head of state typically appears to open a large-scale
Olympic event. Imran, a member of Malaysia's royal family, was in the
room in his Olympic role.</TE>
<TE>   There was one last symbolic note. The Israelis were seated not in
protocol order--in the section of the alphabet beginning with I, near
Iran and Iraq--but with the J nations, between Japan and Jamaica.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis seemed to take it in stride. A small Israeli flag,
the blue-and-white field emblazoned with the Star of David, appeared
on the table in front of the delegation--just like the small,
table-sized flags placed in front of the other delegations.
"Everything," said Zvi Varshaviak, president of the Israeli Olympic
Committee, "is OK here."</TE>

<LD>The Southern Section office on Wednesday denied two protests filed by
Fontana High's softball program in the course of its 3-2 loss to
Etiwanda in the second round of the Division I playoffs Tuesday. A
section spokesman said the protests were denied because there was no
way to substantiate the claims.</LD>
<LD>   One claim was that Etiwanda took batting practice before the game,
which is a violation. The other protest emerged from an incident in
the fourth inning when an Etiwanda player allegedly took a trowel to
the pitching rubber and dug a hole so the pitcher could get a better
push off the rubber.</LD>

field titles when the section championships are held today at Lake
Balboa Birmingham.</LD>
<LD>   The Toreadors could total more than 50 points in the sprints and
relays, but their title chances might hinge on how they do in jumping
events. Birmingham is regarded as a co-favorite with Taft. Reseda
Cleveland, paced by its sprinters and hurdlers, is a slight favorite
to win the girls' title over defending champion Birmingham. The meet
will start with field events at 3:30 p.m. Track events begin at 5:30.</LD>

<LD>Palisades High came to the City Section swimming championships
Wednesday hoping to bring home a team title for the second
consecutive season. The Dolphins doubled their pleasure, winning the
boys' and girls' competitions at USC.</LD>
<LD>   The Palisades girls' team wasn't as fast as it was in the
preliminaries last week, but the Dolphins were deep enough to win the
championship for the second consecutive season. The Dolphins
solidified the victory by placing three swimmers in the top five in
the 500 freestyle.</LD>
<LD>   "That pretty much did it for us," Palisades Coach Merle Duckett
said.</LD>
<TE>   Palisades, which defeated second-place Woodland Hills El Camino
Real, 284.5-229, missed breaking the section record in the 200
freestyle relay for the second consecutive week. The Dolphins won in
1:41.52, just off their record-breaking preliminary time of 1:41.50.
The Dolphins' only other victory came from freshman Cara Davidoff,
who won the 50 freestyle in 24.62.</TE>
<TE>   Duckett wasn't sure why times were slower than last week, but said
it was probably a combination of nerves, a poor taper and Stanford 9
testing that began this week.</TE>
<TE>   The Palisades boys' team won its first team title since 1992,
securing the victory by winning the final event, the 400 freestyle
relay, in 3:27.42.</TE>
<TE>   The Dolphins scored 170 points, Venice was second (155) and Reseda
Cleveland was third (146).</TE>
<TE>   Sean McDevitt of Palisades won the 50 freestyle (22.49), the 100
freestyle (48.83) and anchored winning 200 and 400 freestyle relay
teams.</TE>
<TE>   Tyler Clark of Granada Hills broke a 20-year-old section record in
the 200 individual medley. Clark won the event in 1:55.18, clipping
the mark of 1:55.22 set by Jeff Kline of Granada Hills Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   Clark was relieved to break a record he has been chasing since his
sophomore season, but wasn't thrilled with his time. Clark said he
felt sluggish during the race and was slowed before making the turn
on his opening leg because his arm wrapped around an electric cord
protruding from his lane's touch pad.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed," he said. "I thought I'd feel better during the
race."</TE>
<TE>   Clark came back to win the 100 butterfly in 51.16, just off the
section record of 50.77 set by Tom Liliekis of Woodland Hills El
Camino Real in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Arritt</TE>

<TE>   In boys' tennis:</TE>
<TE>   Individual tournament--Top-seeded Jason Nguyen of Chatsworth, who
defaulted the title match because of an injury as a sophomore in 2000
and didn't play last season, advanced to this year's City semifinals
with a 6-2, 6-4 victory over El Camino Real's Dan Nguyen (no
relation) at Balboa Sports Complex in Encino.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Nguyen, a talented senior who chose not to play high school
tennis last season, will face Palisades freshman Chris Ko in one
singles semifinal Friday at the same site. Ko beat Fairfax's Artyom
Fatkhiev, 6-2, 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   In the other semifinal will be No. 2-seeded Nima Roshan of Granada
Hills, the defending champion who will take on Venice senior
left-hander Jeff Melnick.</TE>
<TE>   Roshan defeated Cleveland's Jared Drucker, 6-2, 2-6, 6-1, in the
quarterfinals. Melnick topped Cleveland's Calvin Chan, 6-1, 6-4.</TE>

<LD>Few people outside the private all-boys' school in Bellflower would
have agreed, but Paul Spittle knew all along that St. John Bosco was
going to be just fine after standout Steve Klosterman transferred.</LD>
<LD>   Spittle and his teammates have made sure of it this season, the
latest example a 15-4, 15-9, 15-13 victory over Thousand Oaks in a
Southern Section Division II boys' volleyball semifinal Wednesday at
Westlake High.</LD>
<LD>   Spittle had 32 kills and Kevin Cape added 25 kills for
third-seeded St. John Bosco, which will play top-seeded Mira Costa
for the championship Saturday at Cypress College.</LD>
<TE>   St. John Bosco has hardly missed Klosterman, a second-team
all-section performer as a sophomore who transferred to Huntington
Beach Marina before the school year.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no doubt in my mind this team would do [well], even
without Steve," said Spittle, who has signed with UC Irvine. "We
wanted to show everyone it didn't matter who we had."</TE>
<TE>   St. John Bosco (39-1) did not trail in the first two games and
will play in a final for the first time since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks (19-5) stunned Loyola in a five-game quarterfinal.
"The first game-and-a-half we didn't show up," Coach James Park said.
"I guess we left it all at Loyola."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Rex had 19 kills for Thousand Oaks.</TE>

<TE>   Anaheim Canyon d. Santa Margarita, 9-15, 15-13, 16-14, 12-15,
15-13--John Parfitt, a junior outside hitter, had 74 kills to lead
Canyon to a Division III semifinal victory at Orange High. Jordan
Bekier had 65 assists for Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Esperanza d. Arcadia, 15-11, 15-11, 15-7--Jayson Jablonsky
had 14 kills and four aces and Mark Lovein had 14 kills and seven
blocks to lead Esperanza (15-5) to a Division I semifinal victory
over Arcadia (23-9) at Placentia Valencia High.</TE>

<HD>Some Talk a Good Game, Then There Are the Angels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'll tell you how dull the Angels are--I found myself leaving the
game early Tuesday night to go home and hear how the wife's day went.</LD>
<LD>   I was at Edison Field again Wednesday, knowing I'd probably have a
better chance of getting a good quote out of someone at Forest Lawn
than anyone in an Anaheim uniform, but it was either that or watching
the season finale of "Felicity".</LD>
<LD>   The Angels are the hottest team in baseball and can't draw a
crowd. They've never had a stretch of success like this in club
history, but who cares? If they didn't have young girls throwing
T-shirts to fans, I'm not sure anyone would come here.</LD>
<TE>   Garret Anderson kept the winning going Tuesday night with a
three-run homer, and after the game, he said, not one single reporter
or radio guy came to his locker to talk with him about the game's
biggest hit. And he knew why.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm dull," Anderson said, and I'd like to give you something more
of what he had to say, but the guy was so boring I stopped paying
attention.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I WENT to the clubhouse determined to help these dullards jazz up
their act, and drum up some interest in the team. I've spent time
with Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and
Golfer Bill Dwyre, so I've trained myself to not yawn directly into
the faces of people who put you to sleep.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, I'm so hardened to listening to nonsense I can make it
appear as if I'm listening now when Dodger Manager Jim Tracy talks.</TE>
<TE>   So I began operation "Get A Personality" with Troy Glaus.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, big guy, how 'bout pointing to the outfield wall when you
come to the plate?" I said. "Babe got a lot of mileage out of it."</TE>
<TE>   "No," Glaus said.</TE>
<TE>   "Then how 'bout hitting a homer for me tonight?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Glaus said.</TE>
<TE>   I yawned. "How about just letting everyone in the park know how
much fun you're having after hitting a ball out of sight?"</TE>
<TE>   "I don't watch the ball; I put my head down and run to first
base," he said, and I was told later that was the best quote anyone
has ever gotten out of Glaus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SO WE were making progress until Adam Kennedy butted into our home
run conversation like he would have anything to contribute. "Excuse
me," I said, "but have you ever hit a home run? And by the way, who
are you?"</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy said he had hit two, but you know how players exaggerate,
and finally he got the hint it really doesn't matter if he has a
personality and went away.</TE>
<TE>   Darin Erstad took a seat on the couch, and just blurted out, "My
girlfriend is from Nebraska and she's not fat." But you know how
players exaggerate.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SOME GUY kept muttering to himself, so I feigned interest.</TE>
<TE>   "I could dunk in high school," said Scott Spiezio, and that's
great I said, now why you don't you go keep Kennedy busy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ERSTAD, OF course, is a player everyone could love. He plays at
full speed all the time, and appears to have a sense of humor and
natural leadership skills. Unfortunately, he dresses like a geek,
which neutralizes his effectiveness. He wears his red baseball socks
like nylons under culottes, which I'm sure draws snickers in the
clubhouse. "The Huskers do it," Erstad said, and I wish I had brought
my cowbell with me so I could have made him feel at home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "WE HAVE fireworks and a fountain," Spiezio said, and I told him I
could hear Kennedy calling his name.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MIKE SCIOSCIA said the Angels are "vanilla," like that's a
revelation. Scioscia said winning brings the fans out, although that
isn't happening. The team has drawn 12,880 fewer fans than last year
for the same number of home games.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a great group of guys here, almost a blue-collar work
kind of ethic," Scioscia said. "Everyone is all business."</TE>
<TE>   How about a little flair? Something more than Mickey Hatcher
wearing his cap backward. The Rally Monkey has been the team's most
charismatic performer the last three years; frankly, I thought it
should've been starting in place of Tim Salmon.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday night's roaring comeback win was entertaining, but the
Ducks actually played before bigger crowds than this.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "[PITCHER] JARROD Washburn will pump his fist into the air every
once in a while," Spiezio said, and you know that old expression
about how first basemen should be seen and not heard....</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WASHBURN MIGHT spice things up. He already has a history of saying
dumb things, and that could make him a media darling.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a guy sitting in the upper deck here last year who used
to hang Ks out when the pitchers struck someone out," he said. "Scott
Schoeneweis and I joked we drove the guy not to renew his season
tickets because we were only striking out one or two guys a game. He
hasn't been back this season."</TE>
<TE>   So now Disney and I know who is driving fans away from Edison
Field, but what about drawing new ones to the ballpark to watch a
good team in the making?</TE>
<TE>   "I like the way Michael Jordan played basketball," Spiezio said,
and maybe the Angels should just let their bats do the talking.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Clauderick:</TE>
<TE>   "I read your article for the first time in a while. I used to skim
it in the newspaper for names, usually just skipping it all together.
From day one I really hated your column. Slowly you've been getting
better. You're funny now, and less inclined to be gratuitously rude.
Careful of that fine line, and you may have gained a reader."</TE>
<TE>   Get lost.</TE>

<HD>Portugal Dismisses Midfielder Kenedy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Portugal, the United States' first opponent at the World Cup,
Wednesday tossed Daniel Kenedy off the team after the 28-year-old
midfielder tested positive for the banned diuretic furosemide, which
can be used to mask other illegal substances.</LD>
<LD>   Kenedy, who plays for Maritimo in the Portuguese first division,
denied any wrongdoing.</LD>
<LD>   "I want to make it clear that I did nothing with intent," he said
in Macao, the former Portuguese colony where the team is training. "I
took something to lose weight.... Those pills had a substance that
showed up in the test, and unfortunately that's what happened."</LD>
<TE>   Kenedy was replaced by Hugo Viana, 19, of Sporting Lisbon.</TE>
<TE>   The Portuguese soccer federation cited only medical reasons for
dropping Kenedy, making no mention of the failed May 14 drug test.</TE>
<TE>   Kenedy is the second player Coach Antonio Oliveira has had to
exclude from the squad because of a failed drug test. In February,
first-choice goalkeeper Joaquim "Quim" Silva was suspended after
testing positive for the endurance-boosting substance nandrolone. As
a result, he was not selected for the World Cup roster.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Joseph "Sepp" Blatter, the FIFA president beset by accusations of
corruption and financial mismanagement, arrived in South Korea and
said at Inchon International Airport that he hoped "we speak more
about football than about problems" in the days leading up to the May
31 start of the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Blatter's campaign for reelection against Issa Hayatou of Cameroon
on Wednesday received the backing of the U.S., Germany and Kuwait.
Robert S. Contiguglia, president of U.S. Soccer, released an open
letter criticizing what he called the "negative rhetoric, histrionics
and embarrassing behavior" of Blatter's opponents.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup will be played in Pasadena,
Fullerton, Seattle and Victoria, Canada, and also will serve as the
qualifying tournament for the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup in China.
The eight-nation event will be held Oct. 27-Nov. 9, with the final at
the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is the defending world champion but still has to qualify.
It will play Mexico at the Rose Bowl on Oct. 27, a Caribbean team at
Cal State Fullerton on Oct. 29 and a Central American team at Seattle
on Nov. 2. The Gold Cup winner and runner-up will qualify for China,
with the third-place team going to a playoff against the third-place
team from Asia.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Belgium Coach Robert Waseige announced that he will step down
after the World Cup. The announcement came only days after Belgium
defeated world champion France, 2-1, at Paris and after Waseige
assailed the Belgian press for its lack of support.</TE>
<TE>   "We have here in Belgium a negative, pessimistic press which
systematically sees the worst in the team," he said. "I regret that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Youri Djorkaeff scored a hat trick and France rolled to a
5-1 warmup victory over the Urawa Reds of Japan's J-League during
heavy rain at the Japanese coastal resort of Ibusuki. Of more concern
to Coach Roger Lemerre, however, was the pain in striker Thierry
Henry's right knee.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to do more tests on Sunday and, depending on the
results, we will do what is necessary," Lemerre said.</TE>
<TE>   That was taken to mean that Henry, who helped Arsenal win the
league and cup double in England, might be dropped from the roster,
but a French spokesman later denied that possibility, saying, "for
the time being the presence of Thierry Henry at the World Cup is not
in doubt."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Argentina, the World Cup favorite, issued its player numbers, with
the players assigned numbers 1 through 9 and 11 through 24. Argentina
will have no No. 10, having been given permission by FIFA to exclude
that number in honor of Diego Maradona.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil, which does not need to withhold its No. 10 jersey because
Pele will be remembered regardless, gave Rivaldo the honor of wearing
that number.</TE>
<TE>   Rivaldo, who finally has shaken off the right knee injury that has
sidelined him for a month, was rebuffed in his efforts to wear a
T-shirt bearing a message of peace that he intended to display during
goal celebrations. FIFA has banned all T-shirt messages regardless of
content.</TE>

<HD>UCLA's Freed Makes Rare Change</HD>
<DH>Softball: Senior has utilized exceptional off-speed pitch
to become Bruins' leader in all-time victories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She doesn't have an overpowering fastball or imposing size, yet UCLA
pitcher Amanda Freed dominates college softball hitters.</LD>
<LD>   She hasn't always been considered the ace of the UCLA staff, but
Freed has won enough games--more than Bruin legends such as Lisa
Fernandez, Debbie Doom and Lisa Longaker--to become the school's
all-time leader.</LD>
<LD>   Her secret: One pitch, the changeup. A hard-to-hit softball
equivalent of Trevor Hoffman's devastating pitch in baseball.</LD>
<TE>   "Amanda has left her name in softball as one of the greatest
changeup pitchers to ever be in the circle," UCLA Coach Sue Enquist
said. "It's fun to watch teams guess change. And then you see them
swing late [at a fastball] because they're guessing change or they
swing way too early."</TE>
<TE>   The pitch is so hard to figure that even Freed can't describe how
she gets the ball to dive sharply as it nears home plate.</TE>
<TE>   "It just comes out the back of my hand," she said. "I've never
been able to explain it. It's like I'm throwing it with my pinkie."</TE>
<TE>   Freed is an indispensable part of a team that is making its fourth
consecutive appearance in the NCAA Women's College World Series.
Top-seeded UCLA, the leader in NCAA titles with eight, opens the
double-elimination tournament in Oklahoma City today against
eighth-seeded Florida State.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the senior is 21-3 with an 0.86 earned-run average,
striking out 168 batters in 1621/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   In the NCAA regional at Columbia, S.C., Freed beat Liberty, 3-0,
for her 97th victory, passing B'Ann Burns, who had 96 from 1994-97.
Freed started the season fourth, overtaking Longaker and Fernandez on
the way to Burns.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even know it was within reach until it was announced
over the speaker one day [at a home game]," Freed said. "Looking
back, it's an honor to set the record with the great pitchers that
have played at UCLA."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the 5-foot-8 Freed is her
athleticism. A former national player of the year at Garden Grove
Pacifica High, she has started for four years in center field when
not pitching for the Bruins, hitting over .300 each season. She is
tied with Yvonne Gutierrez for second place in hits with 261.</TE>
<TE>   "Her value to us is her versatility," Enquist said. "She's in the
No. 2 spot, she's so quick in the outfield. Another trait that is so
impressive is she is an incredible fielding pitcher."</TE>
<TE>   Freed always has been there for the Bruins. She was there to lean
on when former star pitcher Courtney Dale battled through injuries.
She remains an essential cog in the UCLA machine even though
sophomore Keira Goerl has taken over as the lead pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   What Freed wants is another NCAA championship. She is one of five
players left from the last Bruin team to win the title, in 1999, and
she wants a chance to redeem herself for last year's national title
game. Her only mistake was allowing a home run to Arizona's Lindsey
Collins in the Wildcats' 1-0 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I would love to be on the mound on Monday, but then if Keira
doesn't feel the same way, I'd be worried," Freed said. "Whoever gets
the job done is all I care about. I just want us to win the title."</TE>

<BD>THE WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For nearly 30 years, the Mount Rushmore of basketball coaches has had
two faces--and only two: John Wooden and Red Auerbach. Wooden's UCLA
Bruins won 10 NCAA championships, Auerbach's Boston Celtics won nine
NBA championships. It was so exclusive a club that no other coach
merited consideration, much less membership.</LD>
<LD>   But now there's Phil Jackson. His teams have won eight NBA
championships and by the middle of June that number should be nine,
which would tie Auerbach. It's Jackson who has the best winning
percentage (.743) in the history of the NBA and whose playoff winning
percentage (.738) is as impressive. It's Jackson whose teams have
averaged 61 victories per season, six more per year than Pat Riley's
teams.</LD>
<LD>   It's Jackson who was Shaquille O'Neal's choice to coach the
Lakers. It's Jackson who Michael Jordan refused to play without in
Chicago. The other day in Sacramento, when someone asked how the
Lakers have been able to maintain their focus and poise through two
championship runs and 12 consecutive road playoff victories, Kobe
Bryant said, "It comes from Phil."</LD>
<TE>   Most astonishing, though, is that at a time when young stars are
hypersensitive about the slightest criticism, Jackson is able to
publicly chastise his stars, who happen to be the two biggest
celebrities in the league. Philadelphia's Larry Brown, a great coach
by any measure, was ripped for going public with the most basic
criticism of Allen Iverson, that he wouldn't practice. A few days
later, with no prompting, Jackson volunteered that he had initiated a
"heated discussion" with Shaq and challenged his big man before the
cameras and notebooks.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to Jackson's critics, though, time may not do it.
Some say that they, too, could have won championships with rosters
that included five likely Hall of Famers (Jordan, Scottie Pippen and
Dennis Rodman in Chicago, Shaq and Kobe in Los Angeles).</TE>
<TE>   Only 10 days ago, as the Lakers put the finishing touches on San
Antonio and league MVP Tim Duncan, a completely undecorated college
coach, Cincinnati's Bob Huggins, said what more than a few of his
peers are thinking.</TE>
<TE>   "Phil Jackson may be a pretty good coach, I don't know," Huggins
said at the Pro Football Hall of Fame Luncheon Club. "It's hard for
me to tell. The guy never gets up (off the bench)."</TE>
<TE>   A more thorough and insightful assessment comes, not surprisingly,
from Auerbach, who said of having new company at the top, "Look,
records are made to be broken. And Phil, he's a smart guy, a
psychologist with these guys. He knows what the hell he's doing,
there's no doubt about that. He runs the game from the bench really
well."</TE>
<TE>   We'll almost certainly never know how Jackson would do coaching a
team thin on talent because, as one of his former players, Steve
Kerr, often has pointed out, not taking a rebuilding job after
Chicago "is proof of how smart Phil is."</TE>

<HD>Court Examiner for Enron Nominated</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Atlanta lawyer R. Neal Batson was nominated Wednesday as special
court examiner for Enron Corp., in charge of investigating the
complex transactions that led to the company's collapse.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Trustee Carolyn Schwartz, a Justice Department official who
monitors bankruptcy proceedings, selected Batson after reviewing "at
least two dozen excellent candidates," she said in a statement
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The nomination must be approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge
Arthur Gonzalez. In creating the appointment April 8, Gonzalez
established unusual powers for the post, including the ability to
waive attorney-client privilege in order to examine communications
between Enron employees and their lawyers.</LD>
<TE>   The examiner's main task is to probe Enron's "special-purpose
entities," murky partnerships created to conceal corporate borrowings
while boosting reported profits. The examiner also would delve into
accounting irregularities and the question of whether Enron assets
were improperly transferred out of the company before the Dec. 2
bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   Batson, 61, a partner in the firm of Alston &amp; Bird, served as
examiner in the 1989 bankruptcy of the Dallas real-estate concern
Southmark Corp. Schwartz called him "one of the top bankruptcy
practitioners in the country" and said he is "widely respected for
his integrity."</TE>
<TE>   Approval is expected by the end of this week.</TE>
<TE>   The nationwide search for an examiner took longer than expected
partly because of the difficulty in finding qualified candidates
whose law firms didn't already have a role in the massive bankruptcy,
according to people involved in the case.</TE>
<TE>   In accepting the nomination, Batson and his firm agreed to
"detailed restrictions to avoid conflicting professional
relationships that sometimes arise in large and complex bankruptcy
cases," Schwartz said.</TE>
<TE>   As examiner, Batson would be required to file an initial report
within 120 days of his appointment and follow-up reports every 120
days thereafter.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom Secures $1.5-Billion Loan From Bank Group</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Firm agrees to make more frequent repayments.
Accord increases likelihood of additional funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc., struggling to raise cash to pay its debt, won a
$1.5-billion loan after it agreed to make more frequent repayments,
people familiar with the matter said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Banks led by J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and Bank of America Corp.
will provide the loan, and WorldCom will announce details of the
terms today, said Brad Burns, a spokesman for the second-biggest
long-distance telephone company.</LD>
<LD>   "It's good they got this done," said Robert Rock, a fixed-income
analyst at John Hancock Advisers Inc., which owns 31,359 WorldCom
shares. The shares rose 23 cents to $1.65 on Nasdaq.</LD>
<TE>   The accord, which increases the likelihood WorldCom can secure an
additional $5 billion in new borrowing, eliminates a provision in an
earlier financing that required the Clinton, Miss.-based company to
maintain investment-grade ratings.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, WorldCom agreed to pay back the cash it gets from
customer bills every 10 days, instead of once a month, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom, whose debt was downgraded to junk last week, is prepared
to pledge assets and pay twice the interest rates it now pays for the
$5 billion in new loans, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Banks can demand tighter terms and higher rates because WorldCom
needs money to pay back as much as $3.4 billion in debt that may come
due in the next 18 months, and more than $2 billion in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom said Tuesday that it will buy the MCI Group stock that
tracks its consumer unit to save $284 million in annual dividend
costs. Last week it said it will draw down a $2.65-billion bank
credit line to buy more time to negotiate with its lenders.</TE>
<TE>   The moves to raise cash came after Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. and
Moody's Investors Service cut WorldCom's $30 billion of debt to junk
and its bonds fell to less than half their face value. The company
was dropped last week from the S&amp;P 500 index after a 90% decline in
its stock price.</TE>
<TE>   The new asset-backed receivables program, which replaces an
existing $2-billion agreement, gives WorldCom less time to earn
interest on cash it invests.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to its receivables program, WorldCom said last week it
planned to take out a new $2.65-billion loan secured with assets and
add $750 million to an existing $1.6-billion loan that's due in 2006.
The company had $8 billion in credit lines and will allow a
$3.75-billion line to expire at the end of June.</TE>

<HD>Money-Market Fund Investors Wait for Higher Yields</HD>
<DH>Interest rates hit new lows this week. Government-only
funds are yielding more than diversified funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many on Wall Street believe the Federal Reserve is planning to raise
interest rates this year. But that day may not come soon enough for
savers in money-market mutual funds.</LD>
<LD>   The average seven-day simple annualized yield on taxable
money-market funds fell to a record low of 1.32% this week from 1.34%
last week, according to Imoneynet.com in Westborough, Mass.</LD>
<LD>   Even as other market interest rates have risen from their lows
early in the year, yields on money funds--which invest in the
shortest-term corporate and government IOUs--continue to sink.</LD>
<TE>   Many individual investors are earning yields below the
Imoneynet.com average. That's because the average includes funds that
cater solely to institutions. Those funds tend to offer higher yields
than funds for small investors.</TE>
<TE>   The average yield on the main category of small-investor money
funds fell to a record low of 1.16% this week from 1.17% last week,
Imoneynet.com said.</TE>
<TE>   Connie Bugbee, editor of Imoneynet's Money Fund Report, said
small-investor funds may be hampered in part because cash is leaving
the funds, albeit at a slow rate. A cash outflow may preclude fund
managers from taking advantage of new, higher-yielding securities in
the market.</TE>
<TE>   The total net outflow from small-investor funds has been $38.6
billion since early December, reducing assets to $660 billion as of
this week, Bugbee said.</TE>
<TE>   She also noted that investors now can earn a slightly higher
interest rate in money funds that buy only government securities: The
average rate on small-investor government funds is 1.17%, compared
with 1.16% for diversified small-investor funds. Normally, the
diversified funds pay more than government-only funds.</TE>
<TE>   Investors can earn more if they're willing to lock up their money
for at least three months: The annualized yield on three-month
Treasury bills now is 1.74%.</TE>

<HD>Salomon Adopts Merrill Settlement Reforms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brokerage giant Salomon Smith Barney Inc. on Wednesday adopted the
same structural changes--meant to enhance the independence of its
research analysts--that Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. agreed to in its
settlement with New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer.</LD>
<LD>   Salomon Chief Executive Michael Carpenter announced the changes in
an internal e-mail sent to all employees. Carpenter wrote that the
reforms embodied in the Merrill settlement, in combination with the
rules recently approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission,
"set a new industry standard necessary to maintain investor
confidence and provide a useful template for the rest of the industry
to follow."</LD>
<LD>   The changes include a prohibition on investment bankers
influencing analysts' compensation and creation of a research
recommendations committee to oversee changes in ratings by analysts
at Salomon, a unit of Citigroup.</LD>
<TE>   Officials in Spitzer's office praised the move, but said they
would press ahead with their investigation of Wall Street business
practices, which includes Salomon.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Eckstein Should Return Friday</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The only bad news for David Eckstein is that this won't be the year
he plays 162 games.</LD>
<LD>   "I want to do that one of these years," the Angel shortstop said.</LD>
<LD>   He can still at least dream of playing 160 this season after tests
determined the injury to his left knee is only a slight sprain.</LD>
<TE>   Eckstein--who appeared in 153 games last season--is expected to
return to the lineup Friday against Minnesota after missing his first
game of the season Tuesday and also sitting out Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia hoped to take advantage of today's day off
to get extra rest for his leadoff man.</TE>
<TE>   "With a day off it would be a good idea to hold him back and
hopefully give him another two days to get back to where he needs to
be," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, any time they say MRI you kind of shudder because a lot
of times those things come back with some information you don't want
to hear. But we got a good report from Dr. [Lewis] Yocum. It's just a
slight sprain and it should be day to day, so we're looking for
Friday."</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein, who injured his knee sliding Monday, allowed that a
little rest could be beneficial.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way I'd ever ask for a day off, but sometimes a day
off is the best thing for you," he said as he tried to get used to
the idea of watching from the dugout Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday night, he left the stadium to be examined.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a Palm Pilot, so we kept checking [the score]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels returned from their six-game trip with only three
losses since April 23 only to be greeted by crowds in the
14,000-16,500 range for their series against Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's more the dynamics of what's going on--school's not
out, and I think historically crowds are smaller at the beginning of
the year," Scioscia said. "We have 15,000 fans, but they're hard
core.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, we keep the winning up--and it's not winning two or
three weeks, it's getting to the playoffs, becoming perennial
contenders. That's what we think we have the opportunity to do in our
organization because we have a lot of positive signs with some
pitching in the minor leagues, which is a key component. And with the
nice mix up here of youth and productive veterans, we think we're
going to be contenders.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you have to do that to start a tradition over the long
term to get that fan base where it needs to be--and right now we
haven't accomplished that."</TE>

<HD>Tracy Endures a Night Without Sleep</HD>

<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Manager Jim Tracy did not sleep Tuesday night. He sat in his hotel
room and stewed about his decision to stick with reliever Giovanni
Carrara, the right-hander who served up a pair of three-run home runs
to left-handed-hitting Tyler Houston and Geoff Jenkins in the seventh
inning of an 8-6 loss to the Brewers, instead of going to left-hander
Omar Daal.</LD>
<LD>   "The mistake I made [Tuesday] night was trying to win two games in
one day," Tracy said. "I won't hide from that. I'll learn from it,
embed it in my mind and move on. To stand up and face the music ...
it's good to do that."</LD>
<LD>   Daal entered Wednesday night's game with a 4-0 record and 1.03
earned-run average, and Tracy has called him the most valuable
pitcher on his staff. But he didn't go to Daal Tuesday night because
he wanted to save him for possible long relief Wednesday night, when
struggling right-hander Hideo Nomo started, or today, when slightly
injured left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii is scheduled to start.</LD>
<TE>   Daal relieved Nomo in the seventh Wednesday and pitched 11/3
scoreless innings.</TE>
<TE>   Most managers get defensive when their strategic decisions are
questioned, rarely admitting mistakes, but Tracy shouldered the
burden when he said he was "kicking himself" for not making a
pitching change during Milwaukee's eight-run seventh.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a finger-pointer, but [Tuesday] I pointed one at myself,"
Tracy said. "I tell my players that before you point fingers, look at
yourself in the mirror. If that's the message I put out, I'm going to
practice what I preach. I take responsibility for it."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy, in his second year as manager, didn't think admitting a
mistake would compromise his standing in the clubhouse. He doesn't
believe players will lose confidence in him.</TE>
<TE>   "Failure is a tough teacher, but failure teaches better than any
course you can take," Tracy said. "Right now, it looks like it was a
bad decision. I've got to live with it, get over it and make sure it
never happens again."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A 20-homer season in 2000--when he was just 21--fueled
expectations that Adrian Beltre would develop into one of baseball's
best young power hitters, but the Dodger third baseman has only two
homers this season and has gone 123 at-bats without a homer, dating
to April 18.</TE>
<TE>   "Our expectations of him were set so high because he reached the
big leagues at such a young age, but the fact remains that he's 23,
and that's not old," Tracy said. "We label guys too quickly....
Before you become a power hitter in the big leagues you have to have
discipline in the strike zone."</TE>
<TE>   TODAY</TE>
<TE>   DODGERS'</TE>
<TE>   KAZUHISA ISHII</TE>

<TE>   Radio--KXTA (1150), KWKW (1330).</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Brewers entered Wednesday night's game batting .185
against left-handers, and they are 2-6 against left-handed starters,
which should give Ishii an edge. The Dodgers, meanwhile, are batting
.289 against left-handers and are 8-1 against left-handed starters,
so that should give them an edge against Rusch. Ishii has a slightly
strained right hip, but he played long toss Tuesday and declared
himself fit to start.</TE>

<DH>Brazilian drivers have moved to the front and center at
Indianapolis 500, following the lead of Emerson Fittipaldi, who burst
on the scene in 1984</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Brazilian invasion of the Indianapolis 500--four of the first
five starters in Sunday's race are from the South American
country--actually started in 1984, when Emerson Fittipaldi showed up
in a shocking-pink car, wearing a purple uniform.</LD>
<LD>   Fittipaldi's two earlier Formula One championships had made for a
cult following of young go-kart drivers in his home country. Over a
span of 20 years, Fittipaldi, Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna brought
eight F1 titles home to Brazil.</LD>
<LD>   "Emmo was king in Brazil before he went to Indianapolis, but it
was in 1989 when he won the 500, that the whole country came to
recognize Indy as the world's greatest race," said Bruno Junqueira,
this year's pole-sitter. "I had just finished running in a kart race
and was in my hotel. I just saw the end of it, where Emerson crashed
into Al Unser Jr. on the last lap and went on to win.</LD>
<TE>   "Ever since then, Indy is really big in Brazil. It would be good
if five Brazilians were in the top five or six in the race Sunday.
Everyone in Brazil will be watching. Last year they finished first
and second, and I finished fifth. I would like to see a better
showing this year."</TE>
<TE>   Two Brazilians, Helio Castroneves and Gil de Ferran, finished 1-2
last year. In Sunday's 33-car field, there are seven Brazilians,
among them elder statesman Raul Boesel, who is in the front row, Tony
Kanaan, Felipe Giaffone and Airton Dare.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us kids--Helio, Rubens [Barrichello], Kanaan, Giaffone,
Cristiano [da Matta]--we all grew up racing karts against one
another," Junqueira said.</TE>
<TE>   Barrichello is driving a Ferrari in Formula One and Da Matta is
one of CART's leading drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Castroneves, the defending champion, who will start 13th Sunday in
one of Roger Penske's Marlboro cars, also recalls that 1989 race:</TE>
<TE>   "The memories I have are that, from the moment Emerson won, we
were thinking of the million dollars. We all thought, 'Wow, that guy
is rich.' It inspired a lot of kids my age to come to the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   "The tradition is amazing, and that is what makes this place
famous. I hope kids in Brazil are watching this race and are now
looking at it for the same way I was looking for."</TE>
<TE>   Boesel, who followed Fittipaldi here in 1985, says that
Fittipaldi's wins in 1989 and 1993 not only inspired youngsters to
race, but also influenced their fathers.</TE>
<TE>   "First, go-karting in Brazil is very, very popular, second only to
soccer," said Boesel, 44, who is in his 13th 500. "Back in my days,
my parents thought motor racing was for playboys, you know what I
mean, there was no way to make a living off that.</TE>
<TE>   "Today is different. I see a lot of parents that couldn't do it
when they were young, and they provide their kids with incentive.
Sometimes you see young kids that have a lot of potential but end up
with so much pressure from their parents that they waste their
career.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot believe what I see, 6-, 7-year-old boys, driving wheel
to wheel. So when they get to like 15, 16, they are already in
Formula Fords and open-wheel racing. So they already have almost 10
years of experience in racing when they're 16 years old. I think
that's the main reason that you see so many young drivers like
Junqueira to be successful so early.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not only incentive from parents but also from companies,
who put their cards on kids like Barrichello. Barrichello has a
company that followed up on him and gets a share of his salary later
on. I think a lot of companies or private people held [on] at the
beginning, thinking that this could be an investment in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Barrichello left Brazil for Europe and an F1 career in 1990. Last
week, he was winning the Austrian Grand Prix when Ferrari officials
ordered him to slow down and let No. 1 driver Michael Schumacher win.</TE>
<TE>   The passion Brazilians have for racing and their drivers was shown
when Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the president of Brazil, issued a
formal statement calling Barrichello the race winner.</TE>
<TE>   "I started racing when I was 10 years old," Junqueira said. "I
remember when I first started racing karts with Cristiano, it was
difficult because we're from Belo Horizonte. That's the third biggest
Brazilian city, but we didn't have any go-kart tracks.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to go to the parking lot for the soccer stadium and
practice with our karts. Then we had to travel to Sao Paulo, to Rio
de Janeiro, to Brasilia or wherever to race.</TE>
<TE>   "Our fathers used to race each other and when we were little they
would load up the trucks and we would head for Sao Paulo.</TE>
<TE>   "It was difficult, but I think it paid off because I used to race
against Tony Kanaan, against Helio Castroneves, against Felipe
Giaffone. It's really nice when we used to race together to be here
together in the highest point in racing.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember, we used to stay in Tony's house. Tony was like 13,
Helio 12, and I was 10. We used to go to drive, practicing, and after
that we would go out and play soccer."</TE>
<TE>   Giaffone and Barrichello have remained close friends since their
karting days and Barrichello recently married Giaffone's cousin.</TE>
<TE>   Although Junqueira is the toast of the speedway this month as No.
1 qualifier, he was more of an afterthought last year.</TE>
<TE>   When Chip Ganassi named his two drivers for the 2001 race, he
bypassed his duo of Junqueira and Nicolas Minassian in favor of
outsiders Jimmy Vasser from Pat Patrick's CART team and Tony Stewart
from Joe Gibbs' NASCAR Winston Cup team. Once Vasser and Stewart
qualified on the first day, Ganassi turned over backup cars to the
other two.</TE>
<TE>   Junqueira, although disappointed at not getting an earlier chance,
responded by posting the second day's fastest speed.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big surprise when Chip called me to race," recalled
Junqueira. "The guys had said, 'Bruno and Nicolas can go home.' I
just got to 16th Street [just outside the track] and the phone rings.
I thought maybe I had an appearance, but they said, 'No, you're going
to race.'</TE>
<TE>   "I only had one hour to practice. I don't think Chip had planned
to have us drive. He was very brave to do so."</TE>
<TE>   Junqueira's fifth place was the highest rookie finish behind
rookie winner Castroneves.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, even though Junqueira's background is in road
racing, he has had quick success on ovals. He won his first CART pole
at Nazareth, Pa., and won his second race last month in Motegi,
Japan, on another oval. Now he has the pole on the biggest and
fastest open-wheel oval of all.</TE>
<TE>   "I love high-speed corners and the oval is where you find the
highest-speed corners," he said. "I think that is why I adapt so well
to ovals. On my first oval, I was on the pole, but I had to learn how
to run the race, run in traffic with the oval rules. I had to learn
to be patient because it's really different when you're out there
alone qualifying and in the race where you have traffic and
turbulence."</TE>
<TE>   Junqueira also has had another problem, that of adapting from a
CART champ car to an IRL Indy car for the 500.</TE>
<TE>   "Apart from both having four wheels, they are quite different," he
said. "Champ cars have more power and less downforce. That means they
have less aerodynamic pressure to keep the car on the track, so they
are faster on the straights, and the IRL cars are a little faster in
the corners."</TE>

<HD>Bonds Ties McGwire With Homer</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds hit his 583rd home run, tying Mark McGwire for fifth
place on the career list and leading the San Francisco Giants to a
12-5 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Wednesday night at
Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds, who hit 73 homers last year to break McGwire's
single-season record, lofted a two-run shot off Arizona reliever
Eddie Oropesa in the sixth inning for his 16th homer--one behind
Sammy Sosa for the major league lead.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds needs three more to catch Frank Robinson for fourth place.</LD>
<TE>   David Bell homered twice and drove in three runs for the Giants,
the second multihomer game of his career.</TE>
<TE>   He hit a leadoff shot in the third inning off Arizona starter
Miguel Batista and a two-run drive in the sixth off Mike Morgan (1-1)
that gave San Francisco a 5-4 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the sixth, Bonds made it 7-4 when he pulled a 2-and-2
pitch off the foul pole in right field with Ramon Martinez aboard.</TE>
<TE>   Marvin Benard capped the six-run inning with a two-run single.</TE>
<TE>   Benito Santiago drove in three runs for the Giants, who won for
the third time in seven games, and Jeff Kent had two RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona right fielder Danny Bautista dislocated his left shoulder
diving for a ball in the second inning and left the game.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 5, San Diego 3--Brent Butler and pinch-hitter Jose Ortiz
had RBI singles in the eighth inning to lift the Rockies at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Zeile opened the eighth off reliever Jeremy Fikac (3-3) with
a grounder that skipped past third baseman Sean Burroughs for a
two-base error.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Little entered as a pinch-runner, and Butler, a utility
infielder who was starting only his third game of the season, doubled
down the left-field line.</TE>
<TE>   Butler then scored on Ortiz's single to left.</TE>
<TE>   Kent Mercker (1-0) pitched the seventh and eighth to earn the win,
and Jose Jimenez pitched the ninth for his 11th save in as many
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's Mike Hampton went six innings, giving up eight hits and
three runs and departing with the score tied, 3-3.</TE>
<TE>   Padre starter Brian Lawrence gave up 12 hits and three runs in
seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 3, Houston 2--J.D. Drew ended a one-for-17 slump with a
leadoff homer in the ninth inning at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals are 8-1 on the home stand with one game to go, the
series finale today.</TE>
<TE>   Drew, who didn't start the last two games because of his
struggles, struck out as a pinch-hitter in the seventh. In the ninth,
hit a full-count pitch from Ricky Stone (2-2) well beyond the
right-field wall for his seventh homer.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 6, Florida 2--Todd Walker hit the first grand slam of
his career, Cincinnati's second in two games, and added a solo homer
to lead the Reds at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Walker hit his slam in the fifth as the NL Central leaders once
again used one swing to deflate the struggling Marlins.</TE>
<TE>   The Reds have four grand slams in May, a franchise record for one
month. They've hit a slam in each of their last three games at
Cinergy Field.</TE>
<TE>   Florida fell to 2-7 on a 14-game trip, the longest in franchise
history. Marlin pitchers have given up 19 homers in those nine games,
four of them grand slams.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 5, New York 2--Former Dodger Terry Adams pitched six
strong innings for the Phillies at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Adams (2-3) gave up two runs and nine hits. The converted
reliever, who signed an incentive-laden contract with the Phillies
last off-season, has yet to pitch seven innings in nine starts.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Burrell gave the Phillies a 2-0 lead in the first with a
two-run double off Al Leiter (5-3).</TE>
<TE>   In 113 at-bats against the Mets, Burrell has 11 homers and 35
RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Leiter, who began with a major league-leading 1.74 ERA, gave up
five runs and seven hits in six innings. It was just the second time
in 10 starts he gave up more than three earned runs.</TE>
<TE>   Leiter retired the first two batters before Scott Rolen and Bobby
Abreu hit singles in the first.</TE>
<TE>   Burrell then lined a double to left-center field, giving the
Phillies a 2-0 lead.</TE>

<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>Andruw Jones made a sensational diving catch for the final out as Tom
Glavine pitched a four-hitter for his 22nd shutout to lead the
Atlanta Braves to a 2-0 win over the Montreal Expos on Wednesday
night.</LD>
<LD>   "He does something virtually every night to make everyone marvel
at how good he is," Glavine said.</LD>
<LD>   Glavine (7-2) retired nine in a row before Vladimir Guerrero's
two-out single in the ninth. After Guerrero took second on defensive
indifference, Wil Cordero hit a drive to deep left-center.</LD>
<TE>   "I was praying for that ball to come down because I knew if it
stayed up he would find a way to get it," Cordero said.</TE>
<TE>   Cordero had no such luck as Jones ran the ball down, making a
diving catch just above the turf to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   "When he hit it, I thought it was a double," Glavine said. "He
made an unbelievable catch."</TE>
<TE>   Glavine, whose last complete game was a seven-hit shutout here
Sept. 3, lowered his earned-run average from 1.89 to an NL-leading
1.67.</TE>
<TE>   Brave right fielder Gary Sheffield left the game in the fourth
inning after he pulled his left hamstring while running out a
grounder.</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield will be examined by team medical staff in Atlanta on
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "When I reached for the ball, I felt it a little bit, but once I
started running full-speed I felt it more so I kind of slowed down
and protected it," Sheffield said.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Consider the source, but the New York Post on Monday implied that
Mike Piazza is gay. Whether that is good or bad reporting is a debate
for the Columbia Journalism Review.</LD>
<LD>   The question here is, why does the sexual preference of Piazza or
any other athlete matter?</LD>
<LD>   Apparently it does matter to some supposed sports fans who rushed
to call supposed sports talk radio shows--in New York, in Los Angeles
and many other places in between--to discuss the supposed subject. As
if any caller or host had any first-hand information.</LD>
<TE>   It doesn't matter because Piazza and Met Manager Bobby Valentine
and many other Met players said it doesn't matter.</TE>
<TE>   Piazza handled with grace and some humor the hubbub that followed
the gossip item in the Post. Before batting practice Tuesday in
Philadelphia, Piazza stood in front of reporters to say that, because
people were asking, he is heterosexual but that, in his mind, it
wouldn't matter if there are gay players in the Met clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   And there almost certainly are gay baseball players, football
players, hockey players and every other kind of player. The players
don't much care about the sexuality of their teammates.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the old days. Baseball players don't hang out
together, go to dinner together every night, travel cross-country on
trains together. They make so much money, have so many agents,
trainers, tailors, hairstylists, dieticians and personal coaches
around them that most have no real interest in the personal lives of
the men who bat behind them or dress next to them.</TE>
<TE>   There almost certainly will be men and women in this country,
teammates and fans, who will not accept gay players, just as there
are stupid people who hold unfounded biases against African Americans
or Arabs or Jews or Catholics or atheists. There are even gay men and
women who resent married couples. As long as people have different
beliefs or racial characteristics there will be someone to find
fault.</TE>
<TE>   But there will be a large majority of men and women in this
country who will judge other men and women only on what counts.</TE>
<TE>   With an athlete, that would be performance on the field. As long
as an athlete's personal conduct is not illegal or does not
compromise his performance, fans and teammates don't care.</TE>
<TE>   Most Dodger fans will always resent Fox, corporate owners of the
team, for trading Piazza and will always wish for his return,
whatever his sexuality.</TE>
<TE>   Most Laker fans, no matter their personal moral beliefs, do not
condemn Shaquille O'Neal because he is not married to the mothers of
his children. It is not their duty to judge O'Neal on his personal
life, only on his ability to dunk, get rebounds and make or miss free
throws.</TE>
<TE>   Last year the editor of Out magazine, a publication geared to
gays, wrote a column about his supposed boyfriend, a major league
baseball player for an East Coast team who allegedly was too afraid
to go public with his sexuality. (This player, according to the
writer, was not the star of the team, thus eliminating Piazza from
speculation).</TE>
<TE>   Mostly the reaction to this article was that it was a sad way for
a marginal publication to get publicity and that the only person who
had a problem was the author.</TE>
<TE>   Why should any athlete, or any person, have to discuss his or her
sexuality anyway?</TE>
<TE>   Just as a heterosexual athlete doesn't come to work every day and
give interviews to say "I'm heterosexual," a gay athlete doesn't need
to come to work every day and announce "I'm</TE>
<TE>   gay." There is no need for us to hear it, no need for the athlete
to say it.</TE>
<TE>   Until an athlete is ostracized in a clubhouse because of his
sexuality or has a pitch thrown at his head because of his sexuality,
that sexuality is of no public interest.</TE>
<TE>   Americans are mostly fair and accepting. We understand the lines
of right and wrong, of what is our business and what isn't. Why
should we think our athletes are any more or less accepting? Most of
us don't care about the sexual orientation of our next-door neighbor.
Or of our leadoff hitter. The only scandal here is that anyone would.</TE>

<LD>The New York Post on Wednesday fired sports columnist Wallace
Matthews for his Internet posting of a column that criticized the
paper for its reporting of a rumor about Met star Mike Piazza.</LD>
<LD>   The column--written in response to an item by Post gossip
columnist Neal Travis that said "there is a persistent rumor around
town that one Mets star who spends a lot of time with pretty models
in clubs is actually gay and has started to think about declaring his
sexual orientation"--was held from the paper's Wednesday edition.
According to Post editors, the paper was going to run a revised
column today, but instead fired Matthews after discovering the
original version posted on SportsJournalists.com with a note
questioning the Post's integrity and fortitude.</LD>
<LD>   Matthews, who also read his column on ESPN Radio, said he told the
paper, "I was done writing for them."</LD>

<HD>Intelligence Probe Is Congress' Job</HD>
<DH>This duty lies with elected officials, not outsiders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS K. BAKER</AU>
<BD>Ross K. Baker is a political science professor at
Rutgers University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Nov. 4, 1791, an expedition of 2,000 U.S. soldiers dispatched by
President Washington to subdue the defiant Indian Confederation was
set upon by the Indians it was pursuing; almost half of the force was
wiped out.</LD>
<LD>   For this fledgling government, so recently established under the
Constitution, the defeat was humiliating. The event, however, did
give Congress its first opportunity to hold hearings on a national
calamity, which it did in 1792 even in the face of Washington's
assertion of executive privilege--the first time such a claim had
been made.</LD>
<LD>   No doubts were raised about that committee's ability to present to
the American people a satisfactory picture of the events that led to
the disaster.</LD>
<TE>   Would that it were so in the present day, as the 107th Congress
begins its investigation of the Sept. 11 attacks. The call for an
independent commission--and the assumption that the interrogations by
senior statesmen serving on corporate boards or navel-gazing in think
tanks would be any more rigorous than those of the famously combative
members of Congress--is essentially groundless.</TE>
<TE>   The House-Senate Select Intelligence Committee's slowness in
getting its footing is not sufficient cause for some of the most
respected and influential Democratic members of Congress, including
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.), to call for an independent commission to operate
in parallel with the House-Senate panel.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the difficulty for the panel in tracking lapses in
intelligence that might have contributed to the slaughters in New
York, Washington and Pennsylvania is a White House with a penchant
for secrecy. This disposition to invoke confidentiality would hinder
any effort to shed light on our unpreparedness.</TE>
<TE>   The more immediate problem, however, lies with Congress and the
joint House-Senate committee that enjoys both the legal authority and
the budget to investigate the intelligence community's performance.
In a well-ordered political world, this committee ought to be
conducting hearings, calling witnesses and, if necessary, issuing
subpoenas to establish what, if anything, went wrong and what might
be done to avert future disasters. Instead, the committee has had
difficulty pulling free from the political polarization that seems to
afflict much of what Congress does nowadays.</TE>
<TE>   The difficulties that have hindered the committee are not,
however, insurmountable. The sheer volume of material that the staff
must wade through has contributed to the slippage, as has the fact
that the committee must work with the federal government's most
secretive bureaucracies.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the eagerness of Democrats to consign this committee to
operate in the shadow of an independent commission consisting of 14
Beltway nabobs is an appalling abdication of responsibility. It
betrays a fundamental lack of confidence in our elected
representatives to conduct a proper inquiry and puts Democrats in the
uncomfortable position of preferring an elite, nonelected panel over
one that was chosen by the people.</TE>
<TE>   No one would deny that political polarization in Congress has
turned many important debates into grudge matches.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Watergate hearings 30 years ago and the Iran-Contra
hearings of 1986 were conducted in atmospheres that were highly
partisan. Yet both yielded high-quality results.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 70 years, a major factor contributing to the low
esteem in which Congress is held has been its eagerness to delegate
its powers to presidents, bureaucrats and nonpartisan commissions.
This tendency has been most pronounced when there are controversial
issues that members would prefer to dodge.</TE>
<TE>   Grasping the nettle of controversy on matters relating to Sept. 11
may be painful in the short run, but the institution would suffer
more enduring scars from the self-inflicted wound of an independent
commission to perform an inquest that is more properly conducted by
Congress alone.</TE>

<HD>Defanging Iran Could Solidify U.S.-Russia Ties</HD>
<DH>The Bush-Putin summit should address the threat of a Tehran
with nuclear bombs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID MAKOVSKY</AU>
<BD>David Makovsky is a senior fellow at the Washington
Institute for Near East Policy and a contributing editor of U.S. News
&amp; World Report.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is a rub-your-eyes quality to the summit that kicks off tonight
between President Bush and Russian leader Vladimir V. Putin in
Russia. Erstwhile enemies are embarking on a historic new
partnership. If they seize the moment, they could parlay their new
friendship into solving a problem that has eluded them thus far: the
defanging of Iran.</LD>
<LD>   It is hard to escape the view that the traditional rivals are
fundamentally refining their relationship and a U.S.-Russia entente
is in full bloom.</LD>
<LD>   Though the Cold War ended more than a decade ago, it took the
tragedy of Sept. 11 to force the realization that these two former
enemies must work together closely to combat the forces of extremism.
The old mentality of the Cold War lives among many who promote the
spread of Russian nuclear technology to Iran.</LD>
<TE>   But membership in the West has its obligations, namely responsible
international behavior. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell calls the
effort to halt the Russian flow of nuclear technology to Iran a top
foreign policy objective of the U.S. and those seeking to curb
radicalism.</TE>
<TE>   Yevgeny Primakov is a "Cold Warrior" who for decades was one of
Russia's leading Middle East strategists and recently was the
country's prime minister. Strobe Talbott, the Clinton
administration's point man in dealing with Russia, viewed Primakov as
an obstructionist when it came to ties with Iran.</TE>
<TE>   Talbott writes in "The Russia Hand," his just-released memoirs on
his time in office, that "Primakov's view [was] that U.S.-Russia
relations were essentially and eternally a zero-sum game." In other
words, if the U.S. is upset with Iran, Primakov must believe it is in
Russia's interest to foster closer ties with Tehran.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the U.S. has many reasons to be suspicious of Iran. A Jan.
30 CIA report to Congress concludes: "Iran remains one of the most
active countries seeking to acquire weapons of mass
destruction--indicating its desire to develop a domestic capability
to produce various types of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
and their delivery systems."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the efforts of reformers, hard-liners dominate Iran, and
now Tehran is working on a medium-range missile and is moving toward
a long-range missile that could hit the U.S. Can anyone doubt that a
"nuclearized" Iran means the power struggle there will be tipped
further in the direction of the mullahs and away from the moderates?</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, a nuclear-armed Iran is bound to make the Middle East an
even less stable place, as evidenced by Iranian mischief-making
throughout the region. If Iran gets a nuclear bomb and this is
equated with regional primacy, what will be the effect on Arab
countries such as Egypt--always super-sensitive to its position in
the region?</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, one cannot assume that Iran wants to go nuclear merely
for reasons of prestige. Former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani
openly boasted in a sermon a few months ago that once Iran got
nuclear weapons it would be able to wipe out Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Taken altogether, Tehran's behavior has earned it a place among
three states that Bush called the "axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>   The Primakov approach is rendered antiquated by not only the fact
that the countries are no longer locked for advantage in a global
chessboard but because Russia also is worried by the brand of Islamic
radicalism Iran represents.</TE>
<TE>   There is another reason why Russia sells nuclear technology to
Iran in spite of its worries: a desire to make a fast buck. Talbott
says the U.S. has incontrovertible evidence that such technology
transfer has been orchestrated by successive Russian ministers of
atomic affairs. According to Talbott, Al Gore, a key figure in
U.S.-Russia relations when he was vice president, told Primakov a few
years ago that Russia was being at best penny-wise and pound-foolish
since its attitude toward Tehran meant it was forgoing billions of
dollars in revenue from the commercial launching of satellites and
other deals with the West.</TE>
<TE>   "You can have a piddling trickle of money from Iran or a bonanza
with us," Gore reportedly said, "but you can't have both. Why do you
keep trying to have it both ways?"</TE>
<TE>   Whether dealing with outdated ideas of Cold War geopolitics or
driven by financial gain, Russia's approach to Iran is deeply
misguided.</TE>
<TE>   A joint Bush-Putin approach on the issue of nuclear technology and
Iran this week would be the best evidence that this new partnership
holds promise not just for the start of a beautiful bilateral
relationship but also in demonstrating key resolve in dealing with
the roughest neighborhood in the world today--the Middle East.</TE>

<HD>Echoes of 9/11 in the Church Bombing Case</HD>
<DH>Trial was marked by a new maturity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE McWHORTER</AU>
<BD>Diane McWhorter is author of the 2002 Pulitzer
Prize-winning "Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama, the Climactic
Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution" (Simon &amp; Schuster).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bobby Frank Cherry, known to his long-ago associates in the Ku Klux
Klan as Cherry Bomb, acquired a new nickname in recent months: Osama
bin Cherry. For 39 years, he eluded justice for a crime that was the
worst terrorist act of its day, the bombing of the 16th Street
Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., that killed four black girls in
1963.</LD>
<LD>   That was a time before the word "terrorism" was in common usage,
and the usual victims, powerless and largely invisible, received only
cursory benedictions. But that past reached forward across four
decades in the last week, when Cherry finally stood trial in
Birmingham a few blocks from the church.</LD>
<LD>   Images reminiscent of a more recent tragedy could be seen in
photographs displayed on video monitors in the courtroom--firemen and
rescue workers with a thousand-yard stare stood in the rubble of a
famous building, also in a landmark American city, on a mild
September day. At the time, some thought a plane had crashed into the
church. On Wednesday, a jury officially laid the crime to the last
suspect in the case. An unreconstructed racist at age 71, Cherry was
found guilty on four counts of murder.</LD>
<TE>   On Sept. 15, 1963, the conflict in question was a long-running
civil war over the definition of democracy in America rather than a
global clash over the definition of American democracy in the world.
But the parallels between then and now are striking: The bombing of
the 16th Street church, like the destruction of the World Trade
Center, was the "unthinkable"--the end of a national innocence that
is apparently self-renewing.</TE>
<TE>   As in Birmingham, the Sept. 11 terrorists considered themselves
"religious warriors" fighting off godless modernity and the imperial
will of the U.S. government. In the Birmingham case, there also is an
FBI scandal. The bureau's flawed investigation of Cherry (involving a
fake eyewitness account of the crime) was the substance of his
defense. And in perhaps the most dramatic reprise, Sept. 11 brought
home to a victimized nation the state of siege that was a fact of
life for black Southerners in 1963. "It took Sept. 11 for people to
relate to Sept. 15," said Carolyn McKinstry, who was attending Sunday
school at 16th Street on the morning that her four friends perished.</TE>
<TE>   What a difference a year makes. In the spring of 2001, there was
the giddy sense of spectacle at the trial of Cherry's Klan brother
Thomas Blanton Jr., who was convicted of the murders and is now
serving a life sentence. (Robert "Dynamite Bob" Chambliss was
convicted in 1977 and died in prison. The other major suspects,
Herman Cash and Troy Ingram, are dead.) The city had set aside its
most elegant courtroom, and the judge extended magnanimous greetings
to reporters from as far away as London and Australia, who had
descended on the city with an optimistic agenda: to declare the end
to an ancient sectional strife and lay those bad old days to rest.
The only thing standing in the way of "closure" was the judge's
last-minute ruling that Cherry, who was to have been tried with
Blanton, was mentally incompetent to assist in his defense.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Cherry was deemed fit, after a year of hearings and
psychiatric reevaluations, the epoch had shifted. His trial took
place in a charmless basement courtroom, and this time, the judge was
all business. ("Put 'em in the box," he summoned the jury each
morning.) The prosecutors, also crisp and businesslike, let the
archetypal events of 1963 speak for themselves--Martin Luther King's
nonviolent demonstrations greeted by the city of Birmingham's fire
hoses and police dogs, Gov. George Wallace's "Stand in the
Schoolhouse Door" at the University of Alabama and finally that blast
Sept. 15, which a victim's mother testified "was like someone shaking
the world."</TE>
<TE>   The government was no longer "hard-selling" its case to the jury
(the phrase "four little girls" had been repeatedly invoked in the
Blanton trial, even though three were not-so-little teenagers). But
neither did the devotees of talk radio seem so compelled this time to
voice their umbrage at "dragging all that up again."</TE>
<TE>   Most glaringly absent from this final church bombing trial was the
hand-wringing over "closure" that had driven the news coverage not
only of the Blanton trial but of the concurrent drama over another
home-grown terrorist, Timothy McVeigh, whose execution had been
postponed because of an FBI misstep.</TE>
<TE>   Closure is a popular construct that has probably never occurred in
nature. But even as a theoretical quick fix to national self-esteem,
closure died in a mass grave in lower Manhattan on Sept. 11. And it
was a new sense of somber maturity that distinguished the Cherry
trial, the sense of a democracy finally getting the hard work done.</TE>
<TE>   We can no more see an end to the "war on terrorism" than children
of the 1960s could envision a world without Cold War--or than Denise
McNair, Carole Robertson, Cynthia Wesley and Addie Mae Collins could
imagine a world without "White Only" and "Colored" signs. The dead
girls of Birmingham became moral witnesses for the higher cause of
human rights. President Lyndon Johnson used their martyrdom--and the
assassination that occurred two months later in Dallas--to push
through the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which abolished legal
segregation in this country.</TE>

<BD>Norah Vincent is a senior fellow at the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to
study terrorism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I told a friend recently that I was going on vacation in Europe
this summer, he said: "Don't tell anyone you're an American."</LD>
<LD>   Seems like sound advice. More than ever, Americans are targets
these days for invective, if not murder. Moreover, because we elect
our government democratically and because that government is the
richest, most intrusive force on the planet, each of us seems to
carry the burden of our country's actions on our shoulders. More so
than other nationals, each of us is as poisonously emblematic as an
offending T-shirt or a flag.</LD>
<LD>   But vehement anti-Americanism has been around a lot longer than
the war on terror, and in countries that were supposed to be our
allies. Growing up in England in the late 1970s and the '80s when my
father was working at the European headquarters of Ford Motor Co., I
was derisively called a Yank on a daily basis and told in unprintably
explicit terms to go back to my own country. When I was 11 years old,
grown men approached me and said things like, "Thanks for giving us
President Carter" and "You people think you own the world."</LD>
<TE>   September's events and the aftermath have exacerbated these
incivilities. The danger quotient for Americans abroad has soared
because of the continuing terrorist threat. But there's more to it
than that. Something else is afoot.</TE>
<TE>   There was the assassination of conservative Dutch politician Pim
Fortuyn on May 6 and the surprising victory his party enjoyed in the
national elections thereafter, coming as they did after a wave of
anti-Semitic crimes across the Continent. Perhaps it was the strong
showing of Jean-Marie Le Pen in the French general elections this
month or the rise of the British National Party last year in the
midst of brutal race riots across England. Then, there was the
bombing May 9 that killed dozens at a parade in the Russian republic
of Dagestan, an atrocity blamed on Chechen separatists.</TE>
<TE>   These events can't help but make us suspect that something ugly
has been brewing in Europe for a while, and that whatever battle is
coming to a head between East and West may well happen, as it did in
the two world wars, on European soil.</TE>
<TE>   This fear seems to be propelling the strong wave of xenophobia
sweeping the Continent, and understandably so. Europeans don't want
the world's battles fought in their backyard again.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, Europe is beginning to feel like a caldron,
foreboding to outsiders, as it did in the 1930s. As the German
newspaper Tagesspiegel recently described it: "Whether Norway,
Denmark, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Portugal, France, Belgium or
now Holland, everywhere the right-wing populists are on the march."</TE>
<TE>   While it's true that so far the fear is mostly directed at
emigrating potential terrorists, the hate encompasses Americans as
well. And why? Because, as always, we are the evil empire, the
bullying, imperialist philistines who think we own the world.</TE>
<TE>   This is a battle long in the making and one for which Sept. 11 was
only the final catalyst, not the cause. If anything, Sept. 11 is
beginning to seem like an event akin to the murder of Archduke Franz
Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914, which sparked World War I. In this
case, the terrorists' attacks might be the beginning of a third world
war, which may never be formally declared.</TE>
<TE>   History, perhaps, is repeating itself in historian Arnold
Toynbee's spiral; the critical mass is accumulating, though the
combatants have different names and causes.</TE>
<TE>   The pockets of discord stretch from North Korea to Chechnya to
Sudan to New York. There's no escaping it, and the lurid truth of
rabid nationalism and wanton terrorism is that everybody's a target.
Welcome to the new world order.</TE>
<TE>   Have a nice trip.</TE>

<LD>Terrorizing a community was exactly the intention of Bobby Frank
Cherry and the other Ku Klux Klansmen who planted the dynamite that
went off that Sunday morning in 1963. They and other racist
extremists thought that after enough bombs, enough burned churches,
enough murdered activists, no one would be brave enough to keep
battling for racial equality in the segregated South.</LD>
<LD>   How completely they misjudged the nation's reaction to the deaths
of four black girls preparing for choir in the basement of the 16th
Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala.</LD>
<LD>   It took Congress a relatively scant two years to deliver justice
in the form of federal civil rights and voting rights laws. But to
the nation's shame, it took almost four decades to deliver a more
personal justice.</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday a jury in Birmingham convicted Cherry of first-degree
murder for the deaths of Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson, Cynthia
Wesley and Denise McNair, the first three forever 14, the last only
11.</TE>
<TE>   Cherry, now 71, wasn't hiding in a cave all these years. He was
living openly in Alabama and then Texas--and boasting about his role
in the deadliest single act of infamy in the civil rights era.</TE>
<TE>   J. Edgar Hoover's FBI identified Cherry and three other prime
suspects within days of the bombing but brought no charges. If the
years that Cherry and the others lived freely say all too much about
the nation's history, the perseverance of those who at last brought
him to trial offers more optimism for the future.</TE>
<TE>   Former Alabama Atty. Gen. Bill Baxley, who as a law student wrote
down the four girls' names so that he would never forget, reopened
the case in 1970 and convicted Robert "Dynamite Bob" Chambliss of
murder in 1977. Chambliss died in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Another main suspect, Herman Cash, died in 1984 without being
charged. Thomas Blanton Jr. was convicted and sentenced last year to
life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Putting Cherry in prison, even now, sends a message to many
places, ranging from the murdered girls' families to the history
books. The only thing worse than having let him go free this long
would have been to let his role in this infamous act of evil stand.</TE>

<HD>Payback Game Over Judges</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The White House last year agreed to form a bipartisan committee to
vet nominees for federal district judgeships in California. The idea
behind it was a good one: to identify qualified and moderate
candidates for the bench whom the president could nominate and whom
both parties would vote to confirm. The committee, chosen by the
White House and Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, has worked
well; the first nominees it put forward were confirmed in less than
three months, a record for the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   But the very strength of the panel--its bipartisanship and its
focus on quality and moderation--is also its Achilles' heel. Early
hopes that this California model would be replicated in other states
with Democratic senators have faded.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, many conservatives, including some in the White House,
now grumble that to get the judges he wants, the president shouldn't
cooperate with Democrats.</LD>
<TE>   The backbiting may be payback for the Senate Judiciary Committee's
rejection in March of Charles Pickering, the president's nominee for
a Mississippi court of appeals seat. The griping is probably also
intended to rally the troops for today's scheduled Judiciary
Committee vote on D. Brooks Smith, named to the U.S. 3rd Circuit
Court of Appeals in Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   Smith has been a federal district judge since 1988. His record
raises questions about his suitability for this important seat. In
1997, Smith refused initially to recuse himself from hearing a bank
fraud case even though the claims implicated another bank where his
wife was a vice president and where the couple had substantial
financial assets. Instead, in violation of federal judicial ethics,
Smith issued a number of rulings in the case, including several
favorable to the banks, before finally recusing himself.</TE>
<TE>   Smith long remained a member of a club that barred women even
though by 1992 the federal code of judicial ethics specifically
prohibited such membership. Only in late 1999, when the circuit court
seat to which he has now been named first became vacant, did Smith
obey the rules and resign.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's supporters charge that Democrats are unfairly objecting to
every Bush circuit court nominee, denying the president his
constitutional prerogative to pick judges who reflect his judicial
philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate in fact has confirmed 57 district and circuit court
nominations since the Democrats took control of the upper chamber,
more in the last 10 months than were confirmed by the Republican-led
Senate in each of the last several years.</TE>
<TE>   But the political payback aspect of this fight is undeniable. The
hand-to-hand combat over judges continues not only because Bush
nominates too many conservative judges but also because too many
liberal critics paint GOP nominees as panting extremists. There are
legitimate questions about Smith, and the Senate should raise them
today before its vote.</TE>
<TE>   Smith would make a poor appeals court judge. But the issue is
larger. The payback can only end when judicial nominations--and
confirmations--stand for more than political calculation.</TE>

<LD>India's hawks are trying to determine how badly they can hurt
longtime foe Pakistan without provoking a nuclear response. Would
sending a few thousand troops into the part of Kashmir controlled by
Pakistan, destroying training camps, be below the flashpoint? What
about invading a city in Pakistan itself? How about a quick attack
and withdrawal?</LD>
<LD>   The truth is, no one knows the point where the nuclear genie would
come out of the bottle. But we do know that the time to dispatch a
high-ranking U.S. diplomat like Deputy Secretary of State Richard
Armitage to India and Pakistan is now, not in early June as is
planned.</LD>
<LD>   India's prime minister added to the urgency Wednesday when he told
soldiers in Kashmir they had to be "ready for sacrifice" and
proclaimed it was "time to fight a decisive battle." India and
Pakistan have a million troops along their border. Last week, India
expelled the Pakistani ambassador and shifted its paramilitary forces
from civilian to military control, ominous signs.</LD>
<TE>   Britain's foreign secretary, Jack Straw, is due to visit India and
Pakistan next week, but an envoy from the former colonial master of
South Asia doesn't carry the clout of a U.S. emissary. As in the
Middle East, waiting will surely present Washington with a worse
situation later.</TE>
<TE>   Kashmir was the trigger of two of the three wars India and
Pakistan have fought since becoming independent from Britain in 1947.
Both nations tested nuclear weapons in 1998, raising the stakes in
any conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The current military buildup dates to December's attack on the
Indian Parliament in New Delhi, in which five attackers and nine
Indians were killed. India said the assailants belonged to two
Pakistani groups. Last week, separatist attackers struck an army camp
in Jammu, killing more than 30 people, mostly women and children.
India again said the assailants, who were killed, were Pakistanis.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan admits to supporting Kashmiri movements for independence
but implausibly denies that it looks the other way when guerrillas
cross from Pakistan into Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   Previous threats of war prompted President Bush to telephone the
leaders of both countries. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell visited
New Delhi and Islamabad. That diplomacy played a large part in
reducing tensions to a more tolerable level.</TE>
<TE>   India faults Washington for not putting more pressure on Pakistani
President Pervez Musharraf, its ally in the war in next-door
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   India may understand the folly of trying to guess where the
nuclear line is drawn. But British Foreign Secretary Straw aptly
characterized the tensions as "a crisis the world cannot ignore."
Washington needs to get more deeply involved more quickly.</TE>

<LD>Re "Castro Must Yield to U.S., Bush Says," May 21:</LD>
<LD>   Having traveled to Cuba legally and heard from the Miami-based
opposition to Fidel Castro as well as from his supporters, I hope
your readers are as bored as I am by the rhetoric from the Bush
brothers (George W. and Jeb) and the Castro brothers (Fidel and
Raul). The only relevant commentary that has been made is that of
former President Carter, who seeks to open up relations between Cuba
and the United States by allowing a free flow of ideas within Cuba,
something common on the street but badly needed at the higher levels
of government, and by lifting an outdated trade embargo against Cuba
that serves no other purpose than to harm ordinary Cubans.</LD>
<LD>   For the past 43 years, U.S. citizens have been barred from
enjoying one of the world's most culturally rich nations--barely 90
miles from Florida--simply because of politics. President Bush can
tear down that wall. All he has to do is take the first step.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Bush Is Out of Step on Cuba," editorial, May 21:</TE>
<TE>   Blaming Bush's Cuba policy--and previous administrations'
policies, for over 40 years--for the plight of the poor Cubans,
because of our refusal to trade with them, and comparing it to our
policy on trade with China misses the key point. Many other countries
have continued to trade with Cuba, like Canada and Mexico. But,
unlike even China, Cuba refuses to allow foreigners to own property
or businesses. That's why Canada's trade with Cuba has gone nowhere
but our trade with China is growing.</TE>
<TE>   The plight of Cuba's poor is directly because of Castro's
communistic grip. Please don't blame the U.S. for every other
country's problems.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While President Bush was campaigning for his brother's reelection
in Florida, he asked Castro to set up a timetable for "free"
elections in Cuba and suggested 2003. I suggest that he help Castro
in that vein; perhaps he can have Gov. Jeb Bush send the voting
machines used in Florida for our last presidential election; he can
even have Jeb send Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris to
Cuba to monitor the elections. Then there's the Supreme Court. Sorry,
Fidel--I forgot--that's only for our use.</TE>

<LD>Re "SUV Surge Driving Out Small Parking Slots," May 21: Whatever
happened to personal accountability? This article discusses how
cities are mandating that developers build larger parking spaces to
accommodate those humongous SUVs.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA student Jasmine Malek explains why she parks her Ford
Explorer in a compact space with, "If I see a space, I take it."
Leslie Wolff of Los Angeles says, "I think they just have to make the
spaces bigger."</LD>
<LD>   I think Malek and Wolff just have to buy smaller vehicles that fit
within existing spaces. Where does this trend stop? Should we require
developers to build spaces that accommodate a Winnebago?</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The notion of requiring larger parking slots for SUVs makes some
sense. A modest proposal: Design large spaces for the obscene
displays of ostentation and add a surcharge accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   Since land values are at a premium in California, space should not
be wasted.</TE>

experiences leading up to 9/11 to stop future attacks. We should not
blame President Bush or former President Clinton. We should blame a
governmental system where authority and responsibility are diffused.</LD>
<LD>   When counter-terrorism policy involves 50 different agencies at
the federal level alone, information is bound to fall through the
cracks. Take LAX, for example. Dozens of organizations are involved
in its security. These include the Federal Aviation Administration,
the FBI, the CIA, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the
Drug Enforcement Administration, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, the new Transportation Security Administration, local police
and, most of all, the airlines.</LD>
<TE>   These are organizations with vastly different missions,
jurisdictions and cultures. The airlines focus on getting passengers
out the door as efficiently as possible. The FAA is in the regulation
business, creating safety rules that, before 9/11, focused
principally on preventing accidents. The FBI's core mission has been
to investigate crimes. The INS seeks to prevent illegal immigration.
Today, security functions are split between the airlines, which
conduct aircraft searches, receive cargo and match passenger IDs, and
the Transportation Security Administration, which conducts ticket
counter searches and checkpoint screening. Who is in charge when it
comes to counter-terrorism?</TE>
<TE>   What the country needs is a head of security (such as Homeland
Security Director Tom Ridge) who has the rights, powers and resources
to receive and act on all information filtering through the
bureaucracy and to disseminate it to local venues. LAX and other
critical local venues also need heads of security with the same
rights and powers.</TE>

<TE>   Your editorial suggests that it would not have been "a simple
matter to prevent the unprecedented use of aircraft as
terrorist-guided missiles." I couldn't agree more and am disgusted
with politicians who suggest otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   However, it would have been a simple matter to prevent 9/11, if
warnings over many years had been heeded. Airline cockpits had long
been "open to the public." Many of us part-time pilots wondered why,
because to have prevented access to cockpits would have prevented
many airline hijackings over many years, in addition to 9/11. Those
warnings should have been the reason for recent finger-pointing, not
the unexpected suicidal hijackings. The fingers could be pointed in
many directions: the FAA, Congress, etc.</TE>
<TE>   And the lesson is still unlearned by some. On a recent major
airline flight from Managua, Nicaragua, to Panama City, I noticed
that the cockpit door was open for much of the flight and unlocked
for all of it. What will it take?</TE>

<LD>Re "Hollywood Shakes Off Fear of Terror Images," May 20: If they had
made a movie of Tom Clancy's 1996 book, "Executive Orders," perhaps
the CIA and the Pentagon would have been forewarned of an air attack
on important buildings. Clancy writes about a civilian airliner that
crashes into the Capitol building while the president is giving his
State of the Union address to Congress, the Supreme Court, his
Cabinet and other high officials. When the plane crashes into the
building it explodes, the building is engulfed in flames and all of
the inhabitants perish.</LD>
<LD>   The only official left is the vice president, Jack Ryan. Ryan has
been appointed VP only five days previously, to replace the former
VP, who was ousted because of irregularities. Ryan faces the
responsibility of rebuilding the government while facing an
antagonistic coalition of China, India, Japan, Iran, Iraq and other
members of an "axis of evil." Ultimately, the U.S. attacks Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the CIA should hire Clancy as a consultant.</LD>

<LD>As a longtime member of my local Catholic Church, I must tell you
where church is for me. A month ago, I found out that my 62-year-old
neighbor was to die soon from lung and brain cancer. Having been away
from the church for many years due to his second marriage, he and his
wife had no affiliation with the parish. His wife asked me if her
husband could have a memorial Mass at my parish church. They had been
there once and liked it and the pastor a lot. I talked to our pastor
and he said, "Of course, I will do anything they ask."</LD>
<LD>   I then asked our retired pastor to come with me to visit him. He
met with him, discussed his impending death and gave him the
sacraments of anointing of the sick, last rites and Communion.</LD>
<LD>   The couple are so pleased to have been received into our parish
family. As angry and depressed as I am over our archdiocesan
mishandling of child sexual abuse cases going back over decades, it
does not keep me from finding Christ in the love, joy and hurts of
our parish family.</LD>
<TE>   Ralph Sariego</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Roger Mahony says he will finally turn over all
information to legal authorities regarding priests and sexual abuse
and exclaims that "the last thing I want is this going on for months
and months" ("Mahony Vows to Open Files to Authorities," May 18).
Does Mahony not realize that the abuse he enabled will drag on in
these children's lives for years, not months, with devastating
results?</TE>
<TE>   When will Mahony say: "I am sorry. The Catholic Church is sorry.
We have fostered catastrophic damage and sorrow in the very children
we are supposed to protect. I offer my resignation in recognition of
my horrific actions and as penance for my own very sordid part in
this mess"?</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Child molestation is a crime. Those who know about cases of
molestation and do not report it to the proper authorities, or who
pay for silence, should be found guilty of obstruction of justice.
The Catholic Church and Mahony need to be reminded in no uncertain
terms that they are not exempt from the civil laws to which we all
must adhere. Molestation is a heinous crime and all allegations must
be reported and appropriately adjudicated. No exceptions!</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Church Lawsuits Aim to Sidestep Local Zoning Rules" (May 19) failed
to address why Congress unanimously adopted the law. It's because
local land-use decisions invariably ignore important 1st Amendment
principles. Religion is not entitled to "special treatment," except
to the extent that the right to practice religion freely is protected
by the 1st Amendment.</LD>
<LD>   This right doesn't mean much when cities tell churches to get out
of town, which has happened in California, or when cities shut down
prayer meetings in people's homes, which has also taken place.
Congress stepped in to rein in local government, which was trampling
on the rights of churches even to exist, much less to function and to
serve the community.</LD>

<LD>Despite Gale Holland's offensive assertion that Valley residents are
ignorant snobs ("A Municipal Perfect Storm," Opinion, May 19), I
agree with one point she made: The San Fernando Valley city will be
too large. Creating a number of smaller cities makes more sense. For
example, Northridge, Porter Ranch, Chatsworth, Granada Hills, Mission
Hills and North Hills should band together as a single city called
Northridge Hills. Similarly, the communities in the northern, central
and western areas of the Valley could form cities, all of which would
probably be financially sound.</LD>
<LD>   The vibrant and diverse communities of Los Angeles (on both sides
of the hill) do not need a unified city government to represent their
common interests. That is what the county is for.</LD>

<HD>L.A. Acts on Heels of Federal Warnings</HD>
<DH>Security: Officials shut some streets near LAX and issue
pointers on screening apartment tenants. Some critics fear racial
profiling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH and JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Acting on warnings from Washington about new terrorist threats, Los
Angeles authorities on Wednesday took several steps to increase
security, issuing guidelines to apartment house owners and closing
four streets near Los Angeles International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Police Department scheduled a briefing for
emergency workers today on how to handle suicide bombings. Three
police and sheriff's officers who went to Israel for 10 days of
training with the Israeli national police will discuss precautions
against such bombings.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Noel Cunningham, chief of the Los Angeles Harbor
Police, announced new security measures at the port that will affect
both small craft and giant container ships.</LD>
<TE>   Previous warnings from Washington of possible terrorist attacks
have been vague, leaving local officials unable to do anything beyond
maintaining already heightened security measures. In recent days,
however, more specific information has been provided by federal
officials.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, for example, FBI Director Robert Mueller said it is
inevitable that suicide bombers will kill Americans on U.S. soil.
Federal officials said they believe terrorists could be renting
apartments with the intent of blowing up buildings from within.</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines released by the LAPD include the following warnings
to apartment owners and managers on how to spot possible terrorists:</TE>
<TE>   * Be cautious of prospective tenants with little or no rental
history.</TE>
<TE>   * Be cautious of those who "show undue concern for renting an
apartment that cannot be seen by other homes or apartments."</TE>
<TE>   * Observe new tenants when they move in to see if they are
bringing in any "unusual items" such as machinery, chemical drums,
electrical wiring or "boxes carried with extreme caution."</TE>
<TE>   * Watch for tenants who use an apartment in unusual ways, rarely
occupy the unit or overload the unit with more people than allowed on
the rental agreement.</TE>
<TE>   * Watch for unusual digging or trenching near ground-floor
apartment units.</TE>
<TE>   Police stress that the guidelines are purely advisory. Managers
are not required to follow them.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, LAPD spokesman Sgt. John Pasquariello said police do not
intend to encourage housing discrimination. "We're hoping people will
exercise good judgment and not base renting decisions only on a
person looking like they're of Middle Eastern descent," he said. "The
law is the law, and it's not going to change as far as discrimination
is concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for organizations representing tenants and apartment
owners nonetheless expressed uneasiness.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to get our members unduly paranoid that any
dark-skinned person from the Middle East is a terrorist," said
Charles Isham of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, which
represents building owners. "On the other hand, I'd hate to have one
of our buildings go up at 2 in the morning."</TE>
<TE>   Isham said his organization will caution members to be careful but
nondiscriminatory. "You've got to be cognizant of the fair housing
law," he said. "You can't engage in racial profiling."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Gross, executive director of the Coalition for Economic
Survival, said the tenants rights group supports measures that
protect residents.</TE>
<TE>   But "this directive seems like LAPD is encouraging landlords to
establish nothing less than a Big Brother atmosphere that most surely
will impact low-income tenants, tenants of color and tenants of
different ethnic backgrounds," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to give landlords a license to intimidate, harass and
discriminate against tenants."</TE>
<TE>   The apartment guidelines will also be adapted by the L.A. Harbor
Police and circulated among owners of 8,000 small boats. Harbor
Police Chief Cunningham also said that inspections of container ships
entering the harbor will be stepped up. New container seals are being
developed to avert smuggling of weapons of mass destruction into the
area, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham spoke from Oakland, where he was attending a West Coast
meeting on port protection.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been attempting to educate ourselves on suicide bombings,"
he said. "We are working with industry, attempting to develop
inspection sites and container seals. We're working overtime on that,
and we hope to start a pilot program on that shortly."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the unanimous council action closing the streets near
LAX was taken at the LAPD's request.</TE>
<TE>   Officials called it part of an overall reevaluation of security at
the airport and said it was not prompted by a specific threat.</TE>
<TE>   The streets ordered closed were Sandpiper Street between Pershing
Drive and Vista del Mar, which curves over a bluff, placing anyone
there less than 1,000 feet beneath jets landing on or taking off from
LAX's northernmost runway; Georgetown Avenue, McClean Way and a
stretch of Northside Parkway between Lincoln Boulevard and
Westchester Parkway--all because they sit within a short distance of
a runway.</TE>
<TE>   The closures are to last 18 months, but may become permanent.</TE>
<TE>   The city has bought up houses in the area to deal with complaints
about airport noise.</TE>
<TE>   The city's warning to apartment owners is available at www
.updatela.com.</TE>

<HD>Official, Ventura Settle Campaign Suit</HD>
<DH>Fund-raising: City accused Councilman Neal Andrews of
breaking a law in last fall's election. He denies doing anything
wrong.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A settlement has been reached between the city of Ventura and
Councilman Neal Andrews over allegations he had broken a city
campaign law.</LD>
<LD>   Under the terms, Andrews and Sharon Schnell, treasurer of Pacific
Action Consortium, a committee Andrews is accused of controlling,
will each pay the city $1,050. "It was a fairly trivial matter,"
Andrews said. "We don't think we did anything wrong."</LD>
<LD>   But Santa Barbara attorney Stan Roden, hired by the city to
investigate the allegations, disagreed.</LD>
<TE>   The city filed a civil suit against Andrews, alleging that while
running for a City Council seat last fall he broke the city's
Campaign Reform Act. The 1995 act sets guidelines for campaign
fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   "The law is clear: You can't have two checking accounts; you can't
control two committees; and you can't coordinate between two
organizations," all of which Andrews did, according to Roden.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the issue were newspaper ads supporting Andrews
that ran Nov. 2 and 3. The ads were paid by Pacific Action
Consortium, but Andrews' signature appears on the checks. Andrews
started Pacific Action Consortium in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "He and he alone was the one to make the decision to write the ad,
and he wrote the check on the PAC account," Roden said.</TE>
<TE>   In an answer to the suit, Andrews maintains he was merely
performing administrative functions for Pacific Action Consortium,
which is a client of his business, Horizon Management Services. The
ads were created and paid for at the direction of Schnell, Andrews
said. The amount paid for the ads was $723.96.</TE>
<TE>   "The core of this issue is very small,'' Andrews said. "If I
really did control [Pacific Action Consortium], I certainly would
have spent more of their money and less of my own."</TE>
<TE>   Roden said the city could have filed criminal charges but instead
decided that filing a civil suit, and then agreeing to a settlement,
was the best action. "Our overriding goal was to inform the public,
to create a public record and to create a deterrent to make sure this
doesn't happen again," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The maximum fine under the ordinance is three times the amount in
question, which is how the $2,100 figure was reached for the
settlement, Roden said. The suit will be dismissed with prejudice,
which means the city can't bring the complaint back later.</TE>
<TE>   But Ed Lacey, Andrews' attorney, said the county district
attorney's office has been conducting a parallel investigation. "They
can make their own decision if there was any violation of state law,
but we're hoping that the D.A. will see this settlement and say,
'That's good enough for us too,'" he said.</TE>

<HD>Teachers' Bid for More Bargaining Power Fails</HD>
<DH>Labor: But the amended Assembly bill would give them a
voice in choosing textbooks and in developing curriculum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state teachers union on Wednesday lost a bid to vastly expand its
collective bargaining powers but is still trying to gain a say on
such issues as textbook selection and curriculum.</LD>
<LD>   A bill pushed by the California Teachers Assn. would have required
school districts and local teachers unions to negotiate those kinds
of decisions now usually made by administrators. After opposition
from Gov. Gray Davis and school board groups, the Assembly
Appropriations Committee on Wednesday approved an amended version
that stripped out references to collective bargaining and would set
up another system allowing teachers unions to help make those
decisions.</LD>
<LD>   Under the amended bill by Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los
Angeles), local school boards and teachers unions would form academic
partnerships to choose textbooks and develop curriculum and "any
program designed to enhance pupil academic performance." The teams
would not be allowed to address issues of salaries, wages or working
conditions already spelled out in union contracts.</LD>
<TE>   Union leaders said they hoped the new version would satisfy
critics and give teachers a voice in issues affecting their
classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "The basic concept here is having teachers involved in selecting
the tools they use to educate children," union President Wayne
Johnson said. "The concept is a very positive one."</TE>
<TE>   School district leaders called the previous version of Goldberg's
bill, AB 2160, a blatant power grab by the union, and Davis also
opposed it, saying last month that he didn't want "textbooks to be
held hostage to issues involving wages."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, critics assailed the latest proposal as a veiled
attempt to expand union powers. The proposed partnership committees,
they said, would create an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy to argue
over everything from teacher training to parent involvement programs.</TE>
<TE>   The opponents also noted that the amended bill would let district
officials or union leaders file complaints with the state Public
Employment Relations Board for "failure to participate in good faith
in the partnership process." The board regulates collective
bargaining and can issue fines or order negotiating parties back to
the table.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, both sides would have to sign off on any agreements.
Currently, school boards set policies and are required only to
consult teachers unions.</TE>
<TE>   "We think the bill mirrors collective bargaining. We are still
very much opposed to it," said Laura Jeffries, legislative advocate
for the Assn. of California School Administrators, one of the
opponents. "I just see it backfiring."</TE>
<TE>   A Davis spokeswoman would not comment, saying the governor had not
yet seen the amended bill. But she said Davis would resist any
legislation that would bog down textbooks or curriculum in the
collective bargaining process.</TE>
<TE>   "The devil is in the details, and [the governor] is going to have
to look at what those details are and what they mean for students,"
Hilary McLean said.</TE>
<TE>   The original bill pitted Davis against some of his most loyal and
generous supporters--public school teachers. Davis' stated opposition
set off a nasty spat with Johnson, who embarrassed Davis recently by
publicly disclosing that the governor had asked the union for a
$1-million campaign contribution during a meeting in his private
Capitol office.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson has said he doubts that Davis opposed the bill because the
union balked at giving him $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Plotkin, executive director of the California School Boards
Assn., was among the education leaders who met with the union to
draft a compromise on the bill. His association remains unhappy with
the amendments.</TE>
<TE>   The recent meetings were led by Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg,
(D-Sacramento) and included Goldberg, a former teacher and member of
the Los Angeles school board.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg did not return phone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg, who heads the Appropriations Committee, said he
believes that the two sides have begun to bridge their differences.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope this can move forward with some of the rhetoric toned down
and the ability to talk about some of these remaining issues,"
Steinberg said. "There is general agreement that teachers ought to
have real input. The debate has always been about the method to
achieve that."</TE>

<LD>A judge on Wednesday again delayed a preliminary hearing in the
shoplifting case against actress Winona Ryder, despite strong
opposition from prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Elden S. Fox said the hearing to determine if
Ryder will stand trial "must go" on June 3 after being delayed
several times since her arrest in December. Ryder's attorney, Mark
Geragos, requested the latest delay because of his scheduled
appearance in another case.</LD>
<LD>   Ryder was arrested Dec. 12 for allegedly stealing about $4,800 in
clothing from Saks Fifth Avenue. Police said she also possessed a
painkiller without a prescription.</LD>
<TE>   She has pleaded innocent to theft, burglary, vandalism and
possession of a controlled substance.</TE>

<HD>Plan to Dredge Canal on Hold</HD>
<DH>Ruling: A judge extends ban on L.A.'s bid to improve
waterway in Venice. Activists say animals depend on the muddy
habitat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZANTO PEABODY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge has extended an order halting work on a project to drain and
deepen the 95-year-old Grand Canal in Venice, a victory for
environmentalists who want to keep the sloshy crab habitat in a
semi-natural state.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco Superior Court Judge James Robertson II said the
California Coastal Commission, which granted the city a permit to
dredge and upgrade the lagoon, did not consider more environmentally
friendly alternatives.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling, issued Monday, confirms an earlier temporary
injunction that kept Los Angeles officials from making the canal more
like the nearby Venice Canals with their concrete floors and
city-maintained waterways.</LD>
<TE>   The Wetlands Action Network sparred with city officials and the
Coastal Commission over whether the beautification project would be
more detrimental to fiddler crabs and green herons than it was worth.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd rather have nothing than what improvements they were going
to do," said Marcia Hanscom, executive director of the Wetlands
Action Network, which sued to block the dredging. "This is the only
part of the Ballona Wetlands that has not been drilled for oil or
diked off. It does need some restoration work, but it is in good
enough shape not to just dig it up and wall it off."</TE>
<TE>   The judge urged the two sides to meet and discuss whether the city
can alter the plan to the group's satisfaction. Jan Chatten-Brown,
attorney for the network, said she will ask that the city abandon
nearly all of its plan, except a canal cleanup and installing storm
drains to filter debris.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though the Grand Canal may not be all that attractive to an
uninformed layperson, it is exactly what the animals need,"
Chatten-Brown said. "What the city proposed would have largely
destroyed that habitat."</TE>
<TE>   The Wetlands Action Network, along with co-plaintiffs the Sierra
Club, the Coalition to Save the Marina and the Ballona Wetlands
Trust, may have backers to replace city funding if Los Angeles
abandons the project, Hanscom said.</TE>
<TE>   The city has planned since at least 1993 to make the Grand Canal,
south of Washington Boulevard and just north of the Marina del Rey
channel, more like the Venice Canals north of Washington Boulevard.
Those canals, which date to 1907, have been modified over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Residents in and around Marina del Rey paid a $10,000 tax per lot
last fall to fund the disputed upgrade, and the work of deepening the
waterway, landscaping its banks and adding to sidewalks was supposed
to be completed last month.</TE>
<TE>   City officials contested the temporary injunction handed down in
January and Monday's decision, said Leah Wyman, a spokeswoman for
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel it's the wrong judgment, and the project should go on,"
Wyman said. City officials will consider whether to submit a new
proposal to the coastal panel.</TE>
<TE>   Commission chief counsel Ralph Faust said that body may appeal the
ruling, but that the city must decide on a course of action first.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Busching, who lives on Grand Canal Court in a home facing the
canal, said the judge's ruling contradicts what homeowners want.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have now is an area with a bunch of broken pipes and
broken cement that is never cared for," said Busching, who has
already received a refund of his tax payment. "That's just awful. I'd
rather give the city the money to put up nice shores so it will be a
decent, clean canal."</TE>

<LD>   The biggest thugs in the Capitol these days are not the tobacco
lobbyists, teamster bosses or Texas gougers. The biggest thugs seem
to be schoolteachers.</LD>
<LD>   At least, the leaders of the 300,000-member California Teachers
Assn., who have been talking like they're running loan shark or
extortion rackets.</LD>
<TE>   That's the logical interpretation of their warnings that, in
effect, politicians they buy better stay bought. Better deliver. Or
else.</TE>
<TE>   Especially the governor.</TE>
<TE>   But let's back up. Way back to four years ago when the CTA snubbed
then-Lt. Gov. Gray Davis and endorsed wealthy airline mogul Al
Checchi for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. They've been
feuding ever since, even though the CTA did kick in $1.3 million for
Davis' November 1998 election.</TE>
<TE>   The CTA opposed some of Davis' school reforms, especially teacher
accountability features. The union and governor later got crossways
over ballot measures to lower the voter requirement for local school
bonds. And this year the CTA aggressively pushed an impractical bill
to insert textbook selection into collective bargaining.</TE>
<TE>   "A CTA power grab," critics cried. Davis announced his opposition,
angering the union.</TE>
<TE>   But before that, there was the infamous Valentine's Day meeting in
the governor's office between Davis and CTA leaders. They were
talking about policy and "problems," CTA President Wayne Johnson told
The Times, and "out of the blue, [Davis] said, 'I need $1million from
you guys.'"</TE>
<TE>   Now, Davis is an obsessive fund-raiser. Some armchair shrinks
theorize he gets psychic rewards from being given political money.
But thrusting money pitches into conversations about public policy in
the governor's office--while not exactly the same as sex in the Oval
Office--clearly fits into the same bag of classless no-noes.</TE>
<TE>   Garry South, Davis' chief political strategist, disagrees: "The
idea there's no political discussion in the Capitol is laughable."</TE>
<TE>   It's illegal to accept political money in the Capitol, but legal
to ask for it. That's illogical. Sen. Bruce McPherson (R- Santa Cruz)
is trying to close this loophole. But since he's the Republican
candidate for lieutenant governor, you can forget that bill in a
Democratic Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for Davis, news of his CTA solicitation was closely
followed by a San Francisco Chronicle story that he had hit up UC
Berkeley students for money. This one does seem a bum rap.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than putting the arm on students, Davis was inviting "young
professionals" and union members to a big $1,000 fund-raising
reception for the bargain price of $100. The event was not held on
campus, but at the pricey Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco. A
local organizer sent e-mail invites to previous donors, including
students.</TE>
<TE>   The episode grew "into a big fat lie," South asserts.</TE>
<TE>   Capitol eyebrows rose higher when CTA's Johnson again blasted
Davis and unnamed Democratic legislators.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to know who's been taking our money for years, saying they
support our issues and then voting against us," Johnson told the
Sacramento Bee. "We need to hold these people accountable."</TE>
<TE>   The CTA gave legislative candidates nearly $2 million for the 2000
elections.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said of Davis: "Maybe we have to stop kidding ourselves
that because of our tremendous support for him four years ago, we've
got some special relationship. We've gotten very little from him. I
don't see how we could get less, frankly."</TE>
<TE>   Really! Under Davis, starting teacher salaries have risen to
$34,000 from $28,000. Average pay has climbed to $52,500 (as of last
year) from $46,100. Pension benefits have increased dramatically, by
$11.5 billion over a 30-year period. Overall school funding has
exceeded the Proposition 98 guarantee by $8.6billion.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Bergan, president of the 70,000-member California Federation
of Teachers, says of Johnson's comments: "I wouldn't have said that
and I also don't share that view. I think Davis is doing the very
best he can in a very bad situation."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson also had told The Times: "We could not make major
financial commitments to [Davis] unless he does something to really
improve dramatically his popularity with teachers."</TE>
<TE>   That's the kind of talk special interests might whisper, but never
shout in public. Smacks of bribery.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows that people who contribute the most money to the
political system get the most benefits out of it," says Johnson, a
former L.A. civics teacher. "But you're not supposed to say those
things."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson adds: "It really isn't about the money. What it really is,
we feel we've been betrayed. Lied to, manipulated, bamboozled. We
feel like a chump."</TE>
<TE>   While acting like thugs. It's not a good teacher-image.</TE>

<HD>Joe Cobb, 85; Was in 'Our Gang'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joe Cobb, the "fat kid" in the silent "Our Gang" comedies produced at
Hal Roach Studios during the 1920s, has died. He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Cobb died of natural causes Tuesday at a convalescent hospital in
Santa Ana, where he had moved about four years ago from his longtime
home in Culver City.</LD>
<LD>   The chubby Cobb was one of the most enduring and memorable figures
of the early gang of kids assembled by producer Hal Roach at his
Culver City studios.</LD>
<TE>   Beginning with "The Big Show" in 1923 when he was 5, Cobb appeared
in 86 "Our Gang" comedies over a seven-year period. That included the
series' last silent film, "Saturday's Lesson," and its first
all-talking short, "Small Talk," in 1929.</TE>
<TE>   "Joe Cobb was an enthusiastic kid and a kid that the other members
of the Gang respected: cheerful, optimistic but reliable,
dependable," said film historian Richard Bann, who first interviewed
Cobb for "Our Gang: The Life and Times of the Little Rascals," a 1977
book he co-wrote with Leonard Maltin.</TE>
<TE>   "Cobb," Bann said, "always seemed to make you smile when you saw
him."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Shawnee, Okla., in 1917, Cobb arrived in Los Angeles on
vacation with his father in September 1922.</TE>
<TE>   "He thought we'd make the rounds of the studios, and, of course,
we eventually stopped at Hal Roach's," Cobb told Bann. "We drove into
the parking lot just as the noon whistle blew, and so the casting
people took us right out to lunch with them."</TE>
<TE>   That same afternoon, Cobb recalled, he was taken to the wardrobe
department and he immediately began working on a picture called "A
Tough Winter," with Snub Pollard, Marie Mosquini and Jimmie
Finlayson. Cobb played Mosquini's little brother.</TE>
<TE>   After Cobb completed the comedy, the film's director, Charles
Parrott (who also was the supervising director for "Our Gang"),
installed Cobb in the Gang.</TE>
<TE>   Cobb became one of Roach's favorite "Our Gang" members.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that Hal Roach looked for particular types of kids so
that as a kid in a theater looking at those films or even as an adult
looking at those films you could identify with somebody in that
group," said Bann.</TE>
<TE>   "There was always a little girl, a tough kid, a fat kid, the smart
kid, and especially in the silent films, many minorities were
represented. Roach wanted real kids doing real things. He didn't want
actors. He wanted the genuine American boyhood and girlhood
cross-section of kids."</TE>
<TE>   As happens with child actors, Cobb left the series because he got
too old.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving, the studio re-engaged him in 1936 to serve as
master of ceremonies for "Our Gang" publicity tours, and he made
return appearances in three "Our Gang" films.</TE>
<TE>   Cobb played minor roles in films such as "Tuxedo Junction" for
Republic and "Where Did You Get That Girl?" for Universal before
doing defense work as an assembler during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   He retired from North American Aviation, a division of Rockwell
International, in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   In his later years, Cobb made occasional appearances at meetings
and conventions of the Sons of the Desert, the Laurel and Hardy
appreciation society.</TE>
<TE>   "He had the same wonderful personality," said Bob Satterfield,
head of the organization's Way Out West chapter in Los Angeles. "You
fell in love with him the minute you met him."</TE>
<TE>   Bann said the adult Cobb, who never grew much taller than about 5
feet and remained stout, was a true gentleman.</TE>
<TE>   "When you met him, he was the most well-mannered, kind,
well-dressed gentleman, and most everyone liked him because of those
qualities," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cobb is survived by a sister, Lucile Frank of Dallas; and a
nephew, William Engstrom of Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Services will be private.</TE>

<HD>Country Awards Go to Veteran Artists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Familiar faces were the big winners at the 37th annual Academy of
Country Music Awards on Wednesday at the Universal Amphitheatre,
where Alan Jackson and Brooks &amp; Dunn both won three awards.</LD>
<LD>   But the evening's most moving moment came early in the show, when
Jackson accepted the song of the year award for "Where Were You (When
the World Stopped Turning)," his reflection on the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "I've always felt uncomfortable about the attention this song has
brought to me, and I guess I was always uncomfortable about what it
was written about," Jackson said, holding the hat-shaped trophy.</LD>
<TE>   The usually soft-spoken Georgia native then dedicated the award to
the victims of what he called "that cowardly and heartless attack on
America and mankind."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's recording of the song was named the best single of the
year, and the singer also won the male vocalist award.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks &amp; Dunn's three awards--entertainer of the year, best duo
and best video ("Only in America")--brought their total to 16, moving
them past Merle Haggard into first place on the career list.</TE>
<TE>   The ACM awards, determined by more than 3,000 voting members of
the Los Angeles-based organization, were presented at a time when
country music remains in a commercial lull. The genre accounted for
only 10.5% of U.S. record sales last year, according to the Recording
Industry Assn. of America, an 8% decline from a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the industry are hoping that some of the field's
emerging artists will help restore that momentum, but such newcomer
nominees as Kenny Chesney, Sara Evans and the Warren Brothers
couldn't unseat their veteran competitors.</TE>
<TE>   Lonestar was named best vocal group, and Martina McBride took
female vocalist honors. "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" continued its
success by taking the album of the year award. One of its songs, "I
Am a Man of Constant Sorrow," was vocal event of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Ronnie Milsap received the academy's Pioneer Award during the
three-hour show, which was hosted by Reba McEntire. The other
winners: Carolyn Dawn Johnson, new female vocalist; Trick Pony, new
vocal duo/group; Phil Vassar, new male vocalist.</TE>

<HD>Great Minds Unlock the Secrets of Ditch Day</HD>
<DH>Rite: Caltech students spend Ditch Day overcoming obstacles
set up by seniors. Some require mental prowess, others brute force.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eight students dressed in togas lounged on the lawn outside their
dorm, drinking beer and eating doughnuts, fortifying themselves for a
day that would include covering a courtyard in toilet paper,
decorating a bathroom with Cheez Whiz and searching for women's
underwear in the school library.</LD>
<LD>   Such are the rigors of academic tradition.</LD>
<LD>   In this case the tradition was Ditch Day, an 81-year-old rite of
passage at Caltech. Outside of Southern California, Caltech is
probably best known for its expanding collection of Nobel laureates.</LD>
<TE>   But to its students and staff, not to mention Pasadena residents,
Caltech wouldn't be Caltech without Ditch Day.</TE>
<TE>   When else could the students get a chance, as happened Wednesday,
to use their brawn as well as their brains? When do teachers let
students off for the day, especially to search for underwear? (An
explanation on that in a moment.)</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, Ditch Day was a simple, low-key event. Starting in
1921, seniors skipped classes for a day, "a brief respite from the
drudgery of the academic year," according to university admissions
material. But undergraduates eventually got so fed up with the
tradition that they broke into seniors' rooms and wreaked havoc, and
seniors began setting up barriers in front of their rooms.</TE>
<TE>   And then, in a fit of Darwinism, Ditch Day evolved into this:
Seniors set up elaborate "stacks"--hurdles, puzzles and
obstacles--that groups of undergraduates must overcome to gain access
to a senior room, where prizes await.</TE>
<TE>   Caltech officials estimated that there were 20 separate stacks
this year for students to solve; students thought there were more.
Some stacks required intellectual prowess, others brute force.</TE>
<TE>   "And some stacks, you run around and do zany things. Like this,"
said freshman David Griswold, 19, pointing to his toga. Griswold was
a member of a group of seven undergraduates, one graduate student and
one self-described nonstudent, a Caltech groupie who had chosen to be
part of the Toga Stack. Among the first tasks--"TP-ing" the
courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   Toga-clad Jessica Edwards, 23, a graduate student in systems
neurobiology, watched Griswold fail to launch a roll of toilet paper
over an orange tree. "This is the saddest commentary on Caltech," she
said. "None of us knows how to do this."</TE>
<TE>   Students follow the orders left behind by seniors without
question, and each class attempts to outdo the orders left the
previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere one turned Wednesday, students were running across
campus in groups, some in matching T-shirts, some wearing capes or
other costumes. They dragged heavy construction equipment across the
campus and muttered aloud about what might lurk beneath the many
black-tarped obstacles that had sprung up on lawns and patios
overnight.</TE>
<TE>   One group of students built a battering ram--they weren't sure for
what--while another sifted through a box of keys, looking for the one
that would open a student's mailbox.</TE>
<TE>   Some stacks live on in Caltech mythology, among them, the 1987
re-furbishing of the Hollywood sign to read "CALTECH."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, students said, one group was required to film a short
movie: "Godzilla Comes to Caltech."</TE>
<TE>   According to campus legend, any senior caught on campus during
Ditch Day is duct-taped to a tree.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it 11:30 yet?" asked sophomore Debbie Lee, a geophysics major
and member of the Toga Stack, as the group sat outside the school
coffeehouse. Following orders, they had already consumed the
doughnuts and beer (root beer, actually) and were opening a series of
envelopes throughout the day, each assigned its own time.</TE>
<TE>   "My cell phone is going by atomic time," said Edwards, "and it
says 11:28." The group sat together as they counted down the minutes:
11:29 ... 11:30.</TE>
<TE>   "Open it!" said Griswold.</TE>
<TE>   The next set of orders led the group to a subterranean basement of
the geology building, where they found a picture of a professor
holding a "lunch" sign. Faculty and staff members are often drafted
to play roles in Ditch Day.</TE>
<TE>   The Toga Stack's hopes had been answered--except they had no idea
who the professor was.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen minutes later, though, with a bit of ingenuity and a
helpful department secretary, they found professor Geoffrey Blake,
who handed them $100 cash for lunch and another envelope.</TE>
<TE>   The instructions within led the Toga Stack to the library, where
each of the eight pairs of underwear they found contained a hint of
where a final clue might be stored.</TE>
<TE>   By 3:15, the Toga Stackers were using sledgehammers to break open
a column filled with cement and reinforced with steel bars. Inside,
they knew, was the combination to the padlock on the seniors' door.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the Pillar of Ignorance," said sophomore Raj Patel. "We're
smashing it with the Hammers of Knowledge."</TE>
<TE>   It took the Toga Stack almost 45 minutes to break apart the column
and excavate a duct-taped Tupperware container from within.
Combination in hand, they raced upstairs. A cry went up as they
opened the door.</TE>
<TE>   The room was filled with Christmas lights, music and food--enough
cheese, bread, candy and grapes, said Griswold, to make the whole day
worthwhile.</TE>

<HD>Late Learner Had No Trouble Saying Thanks</HD>
<DH>Donations: A Fountain Valley man with dyslexia who studied
writing at Santa Ana College bequeaths the school half his estate,
$500,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roger Comi's dyslexia didn't get in the way of a successful business,
even though he didn't learn to read until he was in his 60s. In
retirement, he was still having trouble writing, so he enrolled at
Santa Ana College.</LD>
<LD>   That was February 2001. Five months later he died of pneumonia at
age 78.</LD>
<LD>   Soon, faculty with the college's disabled students program learned
how great an impact they'd had on him. The Fountain Valley man
bequeathed half his estate--or about $500,000--a gift five times
greater than any in the college's history.</LD>
<TE>   "We're still borderline shocked," said Nilo Lipiz, dean of
instruction and student services at the campus' School of Continuing
Education. "You never think of someone donating hundreds of thousands
of dollars like this."</TE>
<TE>   Comi also left about $100,000 to the Westminster Senior Center,
apparently because he enjoyed computer classes he took there. He gave
the same amount to the Orange Senior Center, where no one remembers
the man who ate lunch there while volunteering at a nearby hospital.</TE>
<TE>   As for his estranged daughter, he left her nothing, said Bob Ault,
a retiree Comi met at the Westminster center and named to oversee his
estate.</TE>
<TE>   The first check of more than $400,000 arrived in April, college
officials said. They plan to use some of the windfall to give more
room to the crowded disabled students program.</TE>
<TE>   Comi was a private man and an impeccable dresser who told his
story to Ault, whom he met about 21/2 years ago in a computer class
at the center. Ault eventually tutored Comi at the latter's home.
Ault was surprised to learn that Comi had appointed him trustee of
his estate, a position similar to an executor.</TE>
<TE>   The son of Italian immigrants, Comi dropped out of school in the
fifth grade, eventually working as a bartender and restaurant
manager.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by ships in a bottle, he started selling kits so people
could grow plants in a wine bottle. The business became a more
traditional plant store, the Plant Hangout, and Comi set up shop in a
North Hollywood storefront. He started another business, Greenery
Interiors, leasing plants to businesses. Soon he owned the building.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Comi sold the business and the building and moved to
Orange County to be near his daughter. He had been divorced twice.</TE>
<TE>   Comi showed up at Santa Ana College for the spring semester of
2001. The place struck a chord with him.</TE>
<TE>   "He used to say, 'I've been in so many classes, but at this one I
feel real, real good, and real comfortable,'" said Onofre Murrillo
Oropeza, a 28-year-old fellow student.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't long before Comi went to Mary Stephens, a learning
disability specialist, and talked of making her program a beneficiary
of his trust.</TE>
<TE>   He told Stephens he wasn't talking about a small amount of money.
She didn't know what that meant.</TE>
<TE>   "For our students in this area of town, even $1,000 is a lot of
money," she said in an interview this week.</TE>
<TE>   When Comi talked to Lipiz about the donation, the dean figured he
meant something in the $100 to $1,000 range.</TE>
<TE>   How about a set of books, Lipiz asked? Comi said he had something
more expensive in mind.</TE>

<HD>Fire Burns 125 Acres Near Santa Clarita</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A brush fire burned 125 acres Wednesday in the Hasley Canyon area of
Val Verde before about 300 firefighters and five water-dropping
helicopters were able to contain it, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   No injuries were reported and no structures were damaged in the
blaze, which started about 8:35 a.m. in medium-to-heavy brush near
Hasley Canyon Road and Burlwood Drive, north of Santa Clarita, Los
Angeles County Fire Department spokesman Albert Flores said.</LD>
<LD>   County firefighters, aided by crews from the U.S. Forest Service
and Ventura County, had the fire fully contained by about 11:40 a.m.,
Flores said.</LD>
<TE>   Firefighters dug a break around the perimeter of the fire to
prevent it from moving uphill toward homes, while helicopters dropped
thousands of gallons of water, Flores said.</TE>
<TE>   Unusually mild weather and winds, as well as brush clearance by
residents, helped firefighters quickly control the blaze, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the blaze has not been determined.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second canyon fire in the area in two weeks. A blaze
last week charred nearly 5,000 acres in Bouquet Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   "With the hot and dry weather we've been having, this is going to
be one of the biggest fire seasons yet," Flores said.</TE>
<TE>   Fire season normally ends in October.</TE>

<HD>County Health System Faces Dire Options</HD>
<DH>Medicine: As deficits loom, the most severe of three plans
would close four hospitals. The mildest would make cuts at King/Drew,
Harbor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI and GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under one scenario, Los Angeles County would have to cut the number
of public hospital beds in half, convert all but three of its six
hospitals into clinics and eliminate more than 8,000 jobs--unless it
got substantial financial help.</LD>
<LD>   And that's not even the most pessimistic scenario. It is just one
of three draft plans obtained Wednesday by The Times mapping out the
sort of dramatic changes that would be needed to close the county's
$688-million budget deficit projected for 2005.</LD>
<LD>   The plans provide the most detailed sketches yet of what the
county's medical system might look like if the state and federal
governments do not provide significantly more funding for the county
Department of Health Services.</LD>
<TE>   Facing dwindling federal aid, department officials are poised to
recommend deep cuts to the Board of Supervisors next month and hope
to close the gap by October.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Thomas Garthwaite, the new director of the health department,
stressed in an interview that the scenarios could change but said the
options under consideration illustrate the magnitude of the changes
coming.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to imagine services won't be impacted," Garthwaite
said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the most pessimistic scenario, which assumes that the county
makes no financial reforms, all hospitals but County-USC Medical
Center in Boyle Heights and Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical
Center in Willowbrook would close, as would the more than 100 public
health clinics scattered across the county.</TE>
<TE>   That option is unlikely. "They should fire me if I recommend doing
nothing," Garthwaite said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the most optimistic plan, the county would have to close the
emergency room at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center near Torrance, eliminate
trauma services at King/Drew, cut the number of beds at Olive
View-UCLA Medical Center in Sylmar and convert High Desert Hospital
in Lancaster into a beefed-up outpatient clinic.</TE>
<TE>   That option assumes that the county gets extra help from
Washington--by no means a sure bet.</TE>
<TE>   The scenario that best reflects the county's present circumstances
calls for converting Harbor-UCLA and Olive View-UCLA into large-scale
outpatient clinics, shrinking High Desert Hospital into a clinic and
requiring that Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center, a rehabilitation
center, become independent of the department.</TE>
<TE>   That option presumes that the county gets no aid from any other
branch of government and so must drastically streamline the way it
delivers medical care.</TE>
<TE>   Garthwaite said he may borrow from all three draft plans in making
his recommendations to the supervisors in June.</TE>
<TE>   Each scenario represents an effort to shift the county's heavily
hospital-based health system to a cheaper outpatient model, an
undertaking that has been urged by some health reformers but faces an
array of political and financial obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals are popular among politicians and public-sector unions,
and the federal government reimburses counties for treating patients
in hospitals, not clinics.</TE>
<TE>   An official at the union representing most of the health
department's 22,000 employees said the scenarios underscore that
elected officials have to get serious about fixing the deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "If the purpose of laying out these cuts is to sound the alarm,
that's a good thing," said Bart Diener, assistant general manager of
Service Employees International Union Local 660. "The worst thing is
fatalism, and we're seeing a little bit too much of that from our
elected officials."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Brian Johnston, past president of the Los Angeles County
Medical Assn., was also aghast. "When you look at the numbers, it's
obvious that something drastic has to change," he said. "I wish the
drastic change was that we opened our eyes and decided we need to
find funding."</TE>
<TE>   The deficit stems largely from the fact that the county health
system treats many of the nearly 3 million uninsured patients in Los
Angeles County. Over the years, the county has lost funding while the
number of uninsured people has grown.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, a $1-billion federal bailout rescued the county from
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   After failing to sufficiently streamline its health system, the
county nonetheless won another bailout in 2000. But federal officials
then suggested that there not be a third bailout in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the county is trying to negotiate additional aid from
Washington. County officials traveled there last month to speak to
the Bush administration about new possibilities for assistance. Those
include giving the health money directly to Los Angeles as a block
grant--as opposed to dictating how the county spends its funds--and
allowing the county to be reimbursed for outpatient care. Garthwaite
said he is optimistic about those discussions.</TE>
<TE>   It is a difficult time, though, to get help from other branches of
government. The state faces a $22-billion deficit, and the Bush
administration has fewer ties to heavily Democratic Los Angeles
County than the Clinton administration, which authorized the two
previous bailouts.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors could buy themselves some time. The county has
about $500 million in one-time reserves it could use to try to close
the deficit, but that would be a temporary, and some officials
believe fiscally imprudent, fix.</TE>
<TE>   Garthwaite said that even without a financial crisis, certain
changes have to be made. He has repeatedly suggested centralizing
complex services such as heart surgery at County-USC, the county's
largest hospital, for example.</TE>
<TE>   In all of the draft plans, high-end medical services would be
centralized at the Boyle Heights hospital. Even in the more
optimistic scenario, the county would pull two of its
hospitals--Harbor and King/Drew--from the trauma network, an array of
specialized emergency rooms that treat patients injured in such
circumstances as gunfights or traffic accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Johnston, the past medical board president and an emergency room
physician, said he was alarmed at that option.</TE>
<TE>   "They should put out a public announcement in some of these
communities that if something bad happens to you, you are on your
own," he said. "That's a very busy trauma center," he added,
referring to King/Drew. "What's going to happen to those people?"</TE>

<HD>Irvine School Board May Delay Picking New District Chief</HD>
<DH>Education: President says decision might best be made after
stalled contract talks with teachers end. Idea draws diverse support.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trustees may put off choosing a new superintendent for the Irvine
Unified School District until they can resolve stalled contract
negotiations with teachers, the board's president said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "It may not be very wise to bring somebody into the middle of
this," Steven S. Choi said the day after the superintendent announced
her retirement. The top administrator's departure, he said, "may open
up some new channels for dialogue. I hope this impasse will settle
down very quickly, then a new person can come in and start his or her
work on more harmonious ground."</LD>
<LD>   Patricia White Clark, superintendent for five years, told a packed
board meeting Tuesday night that she would step down June 30. Saying
she had accomplished most of her goals for the district, Clark, 61,
added that she was retiring to spend more time with her family. "I've
lost close friends who were superintendents in other districts," she
said. "They've died too young."</LD>
<TE>   Choi said the board will meet within two weeks to discuss the
process and timetable for selecting a new superintendent. Making
those decisions, he said, "definitely has to be a high priority. Pat
has been a very strong leader with a strong personality. I prefer to
think positively--this may open up an opportunity for new leadership,
new vision and new hope."</TE>
<TE>   Clark's departure comes at a difficult time for the district,
which operates on an annual budget of about $180 million and serves
nearly 24,000 students. State budget deficits have forced it to close
an elementary school and issue preliminary layoff notices to 130
teachers. Negotiations with the district's 1,200 teachers, who have
been without a contract for nearly a year, were recently declared at
an impasse and turned over to a state mediator.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she made the right decision," Ryan Dahlem, a math teacher
at University High School, said of Clark's resignation from her
$153,000-a-year job. "As a corporate body, we haven't seen much
improvement in the financial situation. There's been a lack of
commitment and compassion toward employees."</TE>
<TE>   Support for Choi's idea of delaying selection of Clark's successor
came from diverse quarters Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Anne Caenn, president of the Irvine Teachers Assn., gave it high
marks.</TE>
<TE>   "It might be difficult for somebody who doesn't know the history
to step in and understand all the players," said Caenn, whose union
has called for a vote of no confidence against the board and
superintendent. "Perhaps it would be best to have one less player."</TE>
<TE>   School board member Sue Kuwabara suggested appointing an interim
superintendent.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to take our time and go through the process the way it
should be done," she said of filling the job permanently.</TE>
<TE>   She said she has been very pleased with Clark's performance. "This
district expects excellence, and we're looking for a highly qualified
superintendent."</TE>
<TE>   Dennis M. Smith, who preceded Clark in the post and called her
"one of the most highly regarded and respected superintendents in the
state," predicted the district would take its time replacing her.</TE>
<TE>   "They won't rush into the selection, nor should they," said Smith,
now head of the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District. "The
board members are wise people, and they will move methodically and
strategically through the process. Finding someone to replace Pat is
going to be a big job."</TE>

<HD>Federal Official Nominated for Judgeship</HD>
<DH>Judiciary: Bush picks Jay Bybee of the Justice Department
for the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The choice comes amid
confirmation disputes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush on Wednesday nominated Jay S. Bybee, a ranking Justice
Department official and a conservative constitutional scholar, for a
judgeship on the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which reviews
cases from California and eight other Western states.</LD>
<LD>   Bybee, 48, has been serving in recent months as head of the
Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which advises the
president and Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft on such legal issues as the
constitutionality of legislation that Congress has passed.</LD>
<LD>   Bybee, who graduated with honors from Brigham Young University Law
School, clerked for a federal judge in South Carolina, spent three
years in private practice in Washington with a large law firm, worked
in the Justice Department during the Reagan administration and was
associate White House counsel under the current president's father.</LD>
<TE>   For the three years before taking his current job, Bybee was a
professor at the William S. Boyd School of Law at the University of
Nevada, Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Bybee's nomination was praised by both Nevada senators, Democrat
Harry Reid and Republican John Ensign.</TE>
<TE>   Reid said that Bybee "has served Nevada with distinction" and that
he looked forward to working with Ensign to move the nomination
through the Senate. Ensign said the nominee "has a brilliant legal
mind."</TE>
<TE>   The nomination comes amid ongoing controversy about the degree of
scrutiny given to President Bush's judicial nominees, particularly to
federal appeals judgeships.</TE>
<TE>   Bybee, who has been affiliated with the conservative Federalist
Society, sailed through his confirmation for the Justice Department
job last year, but "this is different because it is for a lifetime
appointment," said Elliot Mincberg, legal director of People for the
American Way, a liberal advocacy organization in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Given that Bybee has written law review articles and made public
statements on issues including school vouchers and whether certain
congressional powers should be restricted, he is likely to be closely
scrutinized, Mincberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Bybee's former colleagues at two law schools praised him lavishly.</TE>
<TE>   "He is extremely intelligent, an incredibly quick study, works
very hard and is quite independent," said Carl Tobias, a professor at
the UNLV law school.</TE>
<TE>   "He is not always right," said Stuart Green, a law professor at
Louisiana State University, who described himself as active in the
American Civil Liberties Union, "[but] I can't think of anyone with
more integrity and more insight and decency than Jay Bybee."</TE>
<TE>   Bush has nominated candidates for 20 of the 29 vacancies on the
nation's federal appeals courts; nine have been confirmed. Two of the
remaining 11 nominees, Hawaii attorney Richard Clifton, tapped for
the 9th Circuit, and U.S. District Judge Julia Gibbons of Tennessee,
cleared the Judiciary Committee unanimously and are awaiting a vote
from the full Senate. Two more have committee hearings upcoming.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has berated the Judiciary Committee for failing to approve
more nominees and move them to the full Senate for a vote. Sen.
Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the committee chairman, has said that the
committee is simply discharging its proper "advise and consent" role.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Lisa Graves, an attorney on Leahy's staff, said the
Senate has approved 57 judges--including 48 as federal trial
judges--in the last year, more than in four of the previous six
years. During most of that time, Republicans controlled the Senate
during Democrat Bill Clinton's presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Some appointment controversies during the Bush administration have
involved the 9th Circuit, based in San Francisco, which is allotted
28 active judgeships and has four vacancies. A fifth will occur next
month when Judge Ferdinand Fernandez takes senior status and a
reduced caseload.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as the White House indicated last year that it would
nominate Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) for one of the 9th
Circuit vacancies, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and several liberal
organizations said they would oppose the nomination. Cox dropped out
of the running.</TE>
<TE>   Boxer also has said that she opposes the confirmation of another
Bush nominee, Carolyn Kuhl, a Los Angeles County Superior Court
judge, who, like Bybee, worked in the Reagan administration and was
affiliated with the Federalist Society. Kuhl has not gotten a hearing
before the Judiciary Committee.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Palmdale's affordable housing has helped make it the fastest-growing
city in Los Angeles County, and city park officials say the 69.5%
population boom over the last decade has severely affected parks and
sports facilities.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, they are recommending that the City Council approve a
motion to put a $38-million park expansion before residents in a
mail-in vote next month.</LD>
<LD>   The plan, which the council will consider Thursday, would result
in 73 acres of new parkland, expanding Marie Kerr Park on the city's
west side and creating a 33-acre park on the east side. Eleven new
sports fields and an amphitheater would be added.</LD>

<DH>Trial: Santa Paula murder defendant blames the shooting on
two unidentified men.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taking the stand in his own defense Wednesday, a 19-year-old Santa
Paula man facing murder charges denied fatally shooting a woman and
wounding her friend outside a party two years ago and instead blamed
the shooting on two unidentified men.</LD>
<LD>   Defendant Isaac Lara told jurors he heard an argument, followed by
gunshots, on the street outside a house in Santa Paula where the
party was held. When he went to investigate, Lara said, he found
21-year-old Joanna Orozco shot in the chest.</LD>
<LD>   "It didn't seem real,'' Lara testified, telling jurors he tried to
get Orozco medical attention. "No one was helping her. They were just
standing there."</LD>
<TE>   But prosecutors contend that Lara, an alleged Santa Paula gang
member who lost his older brother to gang violence in 1992, shot
Orozco and her friend, Shane Longoria, after confronting them at the
party.</TE>
<TE>   According to authorities, Orozco and Longoria, then 22, went to
pick up an acquaintance at the party on Nov. 7, 2000, and got into a
brief argument with Lara.</TE>
<TE>   Lara allegedly followed Orozco and Longoria outside and began
shooting. Lara, who was 17 at the time, is charged with murder and
attempted murder.</TE>
<TE>   On the stand for several hours Wednesday, Lara testified he had
been drinking beer and taking drugs before the shooting and could not
recall specific details.</TE>
<TE>   But he denied getting into an argument with Orozco and Longoria.</TE>
<TE>   Lara did admit asking the pair where they were from, but rejected
prosecutors' suggestions the remark was a gang-related taunt.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the shooting, Lara testified he saw two men running
from the scene. He said he either picked up a gun or was handed a
weapon by one of the men, whom he could not identify, and hid it
inside the house.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would you take a gun and go hide it?" Deputy Public Defender
William Markov asked.</TE>
<TE>   "So the guy that was running wouldn't get busted," Lara said. "The
people I hang around with, they would do stuff like that for each
other."</TE>
<TE>   On cross-examination, Deputy Dist. Atty. John West challenged
Lara's story and suggested Lara had tailored his testimony to fit
evidence presented during the three-week trial. According to police,
the murder weapon was found in a bedroom closet at the house and
Lara's fingerprints were on it.</TE>
<TE>   The trial is expected to resume today in Ventura County Superior
Court.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lola's Restaurant, a popular West Hollywood nightspot, has settled a
discrimination lawsuit brought by two dozen African Americans who
claimed they were refused entry because of their race.</LD>
<LD>   The terms of the settlement are confidential. Restaurant attorney
Dale B. Goldfarb said Lola's has expressed regret for any
inconvenience plaintiffs believed they suffered but denies any
wrongdoing.</LD>
<LD>   Plaintiff Nedra Jenkins said she feels vindicated by the
settlement.</LD>
<TE>   "Cases like this put restaurants on notice," said Jenkins, who
charged that Lola's canceled her reservations for a 30th birthday
party after discovering she was black. "You cannot discriminate
against people just because of their color .... It's just not
acceptable."</TE>
<TE>   In October, a Los Angeles judge declared a mistrial after a jury
deadlocked on 70 of 72 allegations. In two instances, the jury
cleared Lola's employees of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Goldfarb said the suit was settled to avoid the cost of a second
trial.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs charged that between August 1999 and January 2000,
Lola's turned them away, saying they were not dressed properly or
lacked reservations. The suit alleged those were pretexts.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence against the restaurant was overwhelming,"
plaintiff's attorney Carl E. Douglas said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, he said, testimony included an incident in which a
group of employees from one company met at the Fairfax Avenue
restaurant for happy hour.</TE>
<TE>   "It was basically a mini United Nations," Douglas said. The
whites, Asians and Filipinos were admitted, Douglas said, but the
blacks were barred.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins said she made arrangements with Lola's over the phone
weeks before her birthday party.</TE>
<TE>   The night before the party, she went by Lola's to reconfirm.
Employees said her party was canceled because Hollywood stars had
booked the place for a party.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins said she had to find a new place. The night of the party,
she said, she drove by Lola's twice and saw no signs of a private
celebration.</TE>
<TE>   Goldfarb said the restaurant never engaged in racial profiling.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A state board declined to hear an appeal by a company whose proposed
gravel mine near Santa Clarita was rejected last month by the Los
Angeles County Board of Supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   In a ruling Wednesday, the state Mining and Geology Board said it
cannot weigh in on the dispute between the county and concrete
company Cemex because the proposal involves questions of jurisdiction
between the federal and county governments.</LD>
<LD>   Cemex, the parent company of Transit Mixed Concrete Co., hoped to
extract 77 million tons of federally owned sand and gravel from
Soledad Canyon.</LD>
<TE>   The federal government had approved the project, but Santa Clarita
residents opposed it.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the state mining board said the issue will be
taken up in federal court, where Cemex has filed a lawsuit against
the county.</TE>

<HD>El Rio Man Delays Plea in Teen's Death</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 24-year-old El Rio man appeared in a Ventura County courtroom
Wednesday after being charged with murder, perjury and gang and
weapons violations in the December 1999 slaying of a local high
school football player.</LD>
<LD>   Marcus Morales, who is serving a jail term for robbery, did not
enter a plea during the arraignment in Ventura County Superior Court.
He was ordered back June 12.</LD>
<LD>   Morales, whom authorities describe as a gang member, is accused of
shooting Frank Miramontez, 17, in December 1999 as the Rio Mesa High
football player sat in his 1985 Toyota Celica.</LD>
<TE>   Miramontez was shot twice execution style, and his car was set on
fire. Prosecutors allege the killing was gang-related.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference this week, Sheriff Bob Brooks declined to
reveal a motive for the shooting. He said the two men knew each other
because they grew up in the same El Rio neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks said investigators spent more than 2,000 hours on the case
and conducted nearly 100 interviews.</TE>

<HD>Niki de Saint Phalle, 71; Artist Known for Large, Colorful
Sculptures</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>French-born artist Niki de Saint Phalle, who created a fantastic
world of monumental female figures fondly known as "Nanas" and
crafted vividly colorful sculptures that became popular landmarks in
her native Paris and her adopted home in La Jolla, has died. She was
71.</LD>
<LD>   She died Tuesday at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla of
respiratory ailments after a long battle with emphysema and asthma.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a sad loss for all of us," said Mary Beebe, director of
the Stuart Collection, a renowned public sculpture garden at UC San
Diego. "Her generosity of spirit was enormous."</LD>
<TE>   Saint Phalle's "Sun God," a 14-foot-tall bird perched on a
15-foot-tall concrete arch, is "greatly beloved as the informal
mascot for the university," Beebe said. Installed on campus in 1983,
the improbable creature was the first work commissioned by the Stuart
Collection and the artist's first large outdoor work in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   While "Sun God" looms large in Southern California, a whimsical
fountain of kinetic forms made by Saint Phalle and Swiss artist Jean
Tinguely attracts visitors to a plaza near the Georges Pompidou
Center in Paris. But these celebrated pieces are merely a sample of a
huge body of work that ranges from stylized performances to
sculptures of gigantic animals and bathing beauties.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Schimmel, chief curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art in
Los Angeles, recalled Saint Phalle as an influential artist who rose
to prominence in the 1960s with "shooting paintings," or "tirs," made
by using a rifle to shoot bags of pigment attached to papier-mache
constructions or plaster panels.</TE>
<TE>   "She was quite the catalyst," he said, referring to performances
in which Saint Phalle made her own form of "action painting" as she
splattered paint and ripped canvas. But "the heart and soul of her
work," he said, is the "Tarot Garden," a sculpture park in
Garavicchio, Italy, near the Tuscan town of Orbetello. By far her
most ambitious project, it consists of 22 monumental structures based
on characters in the card game. "That's her all-encompassing vision,"
Schimmel said.</TE>
<TE>   The artist was born Mary Agnes de Saint Phalle in 1930 in the
wealthy Neuilly-sur-Seine suburb of Paris, the daughter of a French
banker and his French American wife. The family moved to New York
when she was 3, and she was raised in a privileged environment of
private schools. As a budding artist in a traditional family, she
married writer Harry Mathews, and had her first child, Laura. In
search of a bohemian lifestyle, they moved to Mallorca, where their
son, Philip, was born, then bummed around Europe for several years
with the children.</TE>
<TE>   At 25, Saint Phalle discovered the work of Barcelona architect
Antonio Gaudi, whose organic buildings became the most dominant
influence on her sculpture. About five years later, she left her
husband and children to become a full-time artist. It was a traumatic
period that "gave me wings as an artist," she said, in a 1998
interview with The Times, noting that she enjoyed a warm relationship
with her children despite the divorce.</TE>
<TE>   On her own in Europe, Saint Phalle formed a friendship with
Tinguely, which turned into a love affair and an artistic
collaboration. They lived together for 11 years before marrying, in
1971. They separated two years later but maintained a close
relationship until his death in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Saint Phalle moved from Paris to La Jolla in 1994 in hope of
alleviating respiratory problems caused by inhaling fumes from
petrochemicals and plastics used in her work. By then, she had
compiled an international resume of exhibitions and collectors, but
she became part of the Southern California art scene--taking part in
local fund-raisers and exhibitions. The Mingei International Museum
in San Diego staged a major show of her work in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   She also maintained a presence in Europe. The Sprengel Museum in
Hanover, Germany, which staged a retrospective of her work in 1981
and maintained a close association with her, has the world's largest
holding of her work--more than 350 sculptures, paintings,
assemblages, drawings and prints.</TE>
<TE>   A self-taught artist who functioned as something of an outsider,
Saint Phalle seemed oblivious to the hierarchies and conventions of
the art world. Although her early work is taken more seriously by
critics than her popular, signature sculptures, she is one of
relatively few women who are known for monumental sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people don't see the edginess in my work," she told The
Times. "They think it's all fantasy and whimsy."</TE>
<TE>   The story behind the art is much more complicated than it looks,
Saint Phalle said. Sculptures that depict black people and mixed-race
couples convey her hopes for reducing racial tensions. Works that
incorporate human skull forms grapple with death, and her animal
sculptures can be rather ominous.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, her trademark "Nanas"--often interpreted as
exuberant celebrations of women's freedom and power--evolved from a
series of sculptures based on women's roles in society, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly independent and self-confident, Saint Phalle
nonetheless had something to prove as an artist and as a woman.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to make some of the really important things of my
generation and some of the biggest," she said. "I wanted to show that
we were capable of doing more than needlework."</TE>
<TE>   Information on her survivors was not immediately available.</TE>

<LD>A former high school honors student convicted of killing his best

parole.</LD>
<LD>   Gerald Johnson, 21, of Villa Park was found guilty in March of
murder and the special circumstance of multiple murder in the deaths
of Jose and Elena Najera.</LD>
<LD>   The Najeras were stabbed to death Dec. 28, 1999, as they slept in

<LD>Police found 30 single-edge razor blades in a playground sandbox
Wednesday at Alton Park.</LD>
<LD>   A resident called the Orange County Sheriff's Department about 10
a.m. to report the blades. The playground, at Alton and Portola
parkways, was raked and checked, officials said, but nothing else was
found.</LD>
<LD>   The discovery was the latest in a string of incidents across
Orange County in which razor blades and nails have turned up in

<LD>Supplemental financial aid? The police log of UCLA's Daily Bruin
newspaper reported the other day that "someone was seen collecting
money out of a water fountain located at 300 Medical Plaza." The
fountain sighting, comes on the heels, so to speak, of another Daily
Bruin item about "a woman wearing a business suit [who] solicited sex
from a passerby on Bruin Walk near Kerckhoff Hall."</LD>
<LD>   Escape from L.A.: Mention has been made here of European towns
with catchy names, such as Orgy and Condom in France and Chaos in
Portugal. Well, Judy Armstrong found another. She snapped a shot of a
signpost telling motorists they were leaving a town near Rome (see
photo). Armstrong wondered if the town name was "a comment on Italian
drivers." In any event, she said, she keeps the picture in her office
as a reminder to stay calm. We could use copies of that signpost on
the freeways.</LD>
<LD>   It's a jungle up here: Rumor has it that San Diego may lose its
Chargers football team to L.A. if a new stadium is built downtown.
But is that all? Arthur Purcell saw a sign posted at 5th and Olive
that said: "San Diego Zoo Parking." Maybe it was a movie prop for
someone filming here.</LD>
<TE>   Then again there does seem to be a lot of secrecy involved in
L.A.'s downtown redevelopment scheme.</TE>

Niguel and the not-so-fragrant meat dish spotted by Duncan Reed of
Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Bizarre moments in local TV news: The latest occurred when Channel
2 anchor Gretchen Carr popped up on Channel 9's telecast of the Laker
game to plug something on her own station. Viacom owns both KCAL and
KCBS.</TE>
<TE>   But it gets stranger. Carr was not promoting a newscast but the
KCBS potboiler "JAG." Or did she think it was a news documentary?</TE>
<TE>   Such a sensitive profession: "When I read your 'worst client

alive"? I assure you I have had no conversations with her since she
died.'"</TE>

<HD>Witness' Memory Is Fuzzy on Oracle</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Davis' ex-aide can't recall details about
accepting a $25,000 donation to governor after contract signing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis' former e-government director testified Wednesday
that he couldn't recall details surrounding the state's ill-fated
$95-million computer software contract with Oracle Corp., including
the name of the bar where an Oracle lobbyist gave him a $25,000 check
for the governor's reelection just days after the state struck the
deal.</LD>
<LD>   Arun Baheti resigned earlier this month, after Davis learned that
he accepted the money last June and sent it by overnight mail to
Davis' reelection campaign committee, in violation of the governor's
stated policy prohibiting aides from getting involved in political
affairs.</LD>
<LD>   Baheti, a lawyer and longtime aide to Davis, told the legislative
committee investigating the Oracle deal that he had never taken any
other donations on the governor's behalf. But Baheti said he couldn't
remember whether he "was surprised or not" that Oracle lobbyist Ravi
Mehta handed him the check.</LD>
<TE>   Baheti testified that he and Mehta didn't discuss campaign
donations. Rather, they discussed policy related to software
licensing and contracts, including at the dinner where Mehta
presented him with the donation.</TE>
<TE>   Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio said the governor learned
about Baheti's role this month when Baheti acknowledged that he had
taken the check.</TE>
<TE>   Baheti testified that he couldn't recall where he first met Mehta
or the number of times they had met, and he was vague on whether he
knew Mehta planned to give him a donation after the licensing deal
had been signed.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning by Assemblyman Rod Pacheco (R-Riverside), Baheti
said the juxtaposition was "clearly wrong enough that I'm unemployed
and sitting before your committee."</TE>
<TE>   "It can give the inappropriate appearance," Baheti said, noting
that a Davis campaign aide chastised him last year for getting
involved in fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   Circumstances surrounding the Davis administration's rushed
decision to sign the Oracle contract have plagued the governor since
the state auditor issued a highly critical report in April saying
taxpayers could be saddled with as much as $41 million in extra
costs. Oracle contends that the deal could save the state more than
$100 million on its software purchases.</TE>
<TE>   The audit noted that Logicon, a Northrop Grumman subsidiary,
brokered the deal and stood to make $28 million even though it also
had worked for the state Department of Information Technology, which
took the lead in negotiating the contract.</TE>
<TE>   Davis earlier this month suspended the department's director,
Elias Cortez, although Cortez continues to be paid his $120,000
salary. The governor also forced Barry Keene to resign as director of
the Department of General Services, which was responsible for signing
the contract.</TE>
<TE>   As Davis' director of e-government, Baheti said he met often with
representatives of high-tech companies who were trying to sell
software and equipment to the state. He testified that he was not
among the boosters of the contract, although a previous witness and
e-mails sent between aides to Davis described him as "hot to trot" on
the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Baheti said he was particularly concerned about Logicon's
involvement, but never raised those concerns with Davis or with the
governor's top two aides, Chief of Staff Lynn Schenk and Cabinet
Secretary Susan Kennedy, in the days leading up to May 31 when the
contract was signed.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in earlier testimony, Republicans elicited during their
questioning of Keene that the Gartner Group Inc., a consulting firm
hired by the state to analyze the Oracle contract, also has done
business with Oracle and Logicon, as well as with Koch Financial,
which helped provide financing for the $95-million deal.</TE>
<TE>   The Joint Legislative Audit Committee began after 4 p.m.
Wednesday, and was expected to continue receiving testimony into the
night. The committee is scheduled to continue hearing testimony
today.</TE>

<HD>Palmdale Council to Consider Park Expansion Vote</HD>
<DH>Recreation: A $38-million proposal could be placed on a
June mail-in ballot. Homeowners would be charged $36 annually.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The brochures touting the most ambitious park plan in Palmdale's
40-year history feature illustrations that look like paradisiacal
visions from other desert cultures: heavy on the fountains,
shimmering blue swimming pools and cool green fields.</LD>
<LD>   For resident Jodi Elam, it's a testament to the special importance
that city dwellers in the Mojave Desert place on their parks, which
can serve as irrigated oases in this beautiful but sometimes harsh
environment.</LD>
<LD>   "We're surrounded by so much dirt that we really love grass," Elam
said. "Grass is a big deal to us."</LD>
<TE>   Palmdale's affordable housing has made it the fastest-growing city
in Los Angeles County, and city park officials say the 69.5%
population boom over the last decade has strained their parks and
sports facilities. Consequently, they're recommending the City
Council approve a motion to put a $38-million park expansion proposal
in front of homeowners in a June mail-in vote.</TE>
<TE>   The plan, which the council will consider today, calls for 73
acres of new parkland, expanding Marie Kerr Park on the city's west
side and creating a 33-acre park on the east side.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven sports fields and an amphitheater would be added. The
east-side park would be the site of an $8.5-million family aquatic
park, with water slides, water cannons and swimming pools.</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale has about 477 acres of developed and undeveloped parkland
to serve 116,000 residents.</TE>
<TE>   That ratio is about par for the urbanized areas of Los Angeles
County, which have about four acres of land per 1,000 residents,
according to Larry Kaplan, the California director of the nonprofit
Trust for Public Land. Most park advocates believe those numbers are
inadequate: The National Recreation and Park Assn. recommends 6.25 to
10.5 acres of usable parkland per 1,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Lasagna, Palmdale's city parks director, said the city has
been feeling the crunch. Young families attracted by the city's
inexpensive housing are finding their children regularly being put on
waiting lists for city-sponsored swimming lessons and sports leagues,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We now have a shortage of facilities," Lasagna said. "Getting
kids into swimming lessons in the summer is a very difficult
process."</TE>
<TE>   But getting a majority of voting homeowners to support the measure
might be just as difficult. About $26 million of the funding for the
project would come from a $36 annual tax on homeowners that would
last 30 years, with the rest coming from state funds and local
environmental impact fees.</TE>
<TE>   Although no organized opposition has emerged, park supporters know
Palmdale homeowners are especially wary of new property assessments.
Two school bond measures were rejected in 1996 and 1997, and a
$25-million school bond barely passed last year after a state law
lowered the votes needed for passage from 67% to 55%.</TE>
<TE>   Resident Mary Spiva said while she's all for strolling in the
grass, she doesn't believe parks should be the city's top priority.
"If they're going to tax me with a bond, I'd rather pay for law
enforcement," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A city-sponsored poll in 2000 showed 63% of voters would support
the parks measure.</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan lauded Palmdale for considering setting aside more parkland
now, when open space is still plentiful.</TE>
<TE>   Elam, who sat on an advisory board that helped draft the park
plan, agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at L.A.," she said. "L.A. is built out, and you can't go
back and unbuild."</TE>
<TE>   "We have an opportunity to build these parks now so they will be
there forever."</TE>

<HD>Charges Fly at Riverside College Over Suspension</HD>
<DH>Academics: Faculty and students protest, saying teacher was
disciplined in retaliation for audit of school's spending. Campus
president denies the accusation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In what local academics are calling an infringement on academic
freedom, a Riverside Community College instructor has been suspended
just days after he accused the school of inappropriately spending
money earmarked for the classroom.</LD>
<LD>   College administrators allege that Frank Stearns, a tenured
accounting instructor, was removed from campus for poor performance,
including letting class out early on 45 occasions.</LD>
<LD>   "This is just the latest in a long line of abuses by this
administration," said David Baker, chairman of the school's
Behavioral Science Department.</LD>
<TE>   Baker was among more than two dozen students and teachers carrying
picket signs outside the college's board meeting Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Baker and other faculty members lashed out at Riverside Community
College President Salvatore Rotella, who they say is an autocrat who
cares very little about the welfare of teachers and students.</TE>
<TE>   Rotella said in an interview that he denies the accusations.</TE>
<TE>   Rotella said he could not discuss the specific allegations that
led to Stearns' leave, saying laws prohibit him from commenting on a
private personnel matter.</TE>
<TE>   Stearns could not be reached Wednesday. His attorney, Marianne
Reinhold, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Dwight Lomayesva, president of the Riverside chapter of California
Teachers Assn., said that Stearns is not the only faculty member
abruptly removed from campus. In the past year, another tenured
business teacher, Pam Moore, was put on leave. Rebecca Morgan, a
counselor at a Norco satellite campus, and cosmetology teacher Sandy
Leiske were also let go, despite glowing annual reviews, union
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Leiske was also at Tuesday's protest and said she is still trying
to understand why she was let go.</TE>
<TE>   "I was never given a reason," said Leiske. "I was just told my
contract isn't being renewed."</TE>
<TE>   Some instructors said Rotella may be reluctant to hire too many
tenured instructors because that would make it harder for him to hire
and fire faculty.</TE>
<TE>   Others said that teachers who openly criticize the administration
are singled out for punishment. As a result, teachers say their
academic freedoms are compromised because they are increasingly
fearful of criticizing the school's curriculum or policy decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "People are tense. People are afraid to speak out," Baker said.
"And that's not the way to run a school."</TE>
<TE>   "There is a tremendous chill on the campus now," said instructor
Cheri Wallace. "It affects our ability to speak out in meetings for
fear of becoming a target .... This is an unhealthy environment for
learning."</TE>
<TE>   Stearns' dispute with the campus administration came to a head in
March.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-year veteran of the college was put on administrative
leave. The sanction came less than a week after completion of an
audit of school expenditures, union officials said.</TE>
<TE>   State law dictates that at least 50% of school funds must be spent
in the classroom and on teacher salaries. Stearns, who conducted the
audit on behalf of the teachers union, reportedly tried twice to meet
with school administrators because he believed the school was not
meeting the 50% standard.</TE>
<TE>   Both meetings were canceled, Lomayesva said. Rotella said Stearns'
audits were premature because he did not have all the needed
paperwork. Two independent auditors have since reviewed the school's
expenditures and found they were in compliance with state laws,
Rotella said.</TE>
<TE>   James Buysse, vice president for finance, reported Stearns to the
California Board of Accountancy. The school alleged that Stearns'
review was biased because he draws his salary from the same pool of
money he was auditing.</TE>
<TE>   The state accountancy board, however, found Stearns did not act
inappropriately.</TE>
<TE>   Stearns was later elected chairman of the Business Department, but
Rotella refused to allow him to assume the post, Lomayesva said. In
March, Stearns was ordered to turn in his keys and not to return to
campus. Substitute teachers were brought in to finish classes, which
conclude this month.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe this teacher was singled out because of his report,"
said Wallace. "And I also believe professor Stearns will be totally
exonerated."</TE>
<TE>   Stearns will argue his case later this year before an
administrative law judge.</TE>
<TE>   Rotella, meanwhile, said he regrets the turmoil caused by Stearns'
removal. "I can tell you this isn't an easy or pleasant thing to do,"
Rotella said. "But we've done everything as truthfully and honestly
as we can."</TE>

<HD>Family Sues Amusement Park Owner Over Death</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The parents of a Fontana woman who died last year after riding a
roller coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia sued the
amusement park's corporate owners Wednesday, accusing them of
knowingly operating a dangerously violent ride.</LD>
<LD>   A wrongful-death lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court
contends that the violent nature of the Goliath roller coaster caused
the June 2001 death of Pearl Santos, 28. It also accuses park
officials of inadequately warning patrons about the ride's potential
lethal hazards.</LD>
<LD>   Park officials "pushed the envelope for thrills to the point that
the stresses and forces acting on the human body ... [caused] serious
injuries," according to the lawsuit by Santos' parents, Felipe and
Juana Santos.</LD>
<TE>   The complaint alleges that the park knew of serious injuries that
had occurred to other passengers, but did nothing because the
attraction was an enormous money maker.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials said Wednesday that the ride is safe and did not
cause the death. They said they were not aware of any other serious
injuries or deaths on the ride.</TE>
<TE>   "We've delivered millions of safe rides on the Goliath," said
Debbie Nauser, a spokeswoman for Six Flags Inc., which owns the
Valencia park and 37 other amusement parks in North America and
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Nauser said Santos had "a preexisting condition, and any medical
doctor will tell you [her death] was not caused by a roller coaster."</TE>
<TE>   Santos, an elementary school teacher's aide, was unconscious by
the end of her ride on Goliath on June 2, 2001, and she was
pronounced dead a short time later.</TE>
<TE>   A Cal/OSHA investigation last year concluded that the Goliath was
operating properly and that Santos' fatal injury was the result of a
preexisting condition.</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy report by the Los Angeles County coroner's office
determined the roller coaster caused the rupture of a preexisting
aneurysm--an abnormal dilation of a blood vessel in her brain--and
that the stress associated with the roller coaster ride probably was
a factor in her death.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Novack, who represents the parents, said the woman's
aneurysm was asymptomatic and that she "could have lived to a ripe
old age" with her condition, which she did not know about, if not for
the roller coaster ride.</TE>
<TE>   Amusement parks have "an obligation to tell the public that they
have a risk of serious injury or death, even if the riders feel they
are in good health," he said. "These should be thrill rides, not kill
rides."</TE>
<TE>   Opened in February 2000, Goliath quickly became one of the park's
most popular attractions.</TE>
<TE>   Riders plunge down a 255-feet freefall, whip around a corkscrew,
hit speeds of 85 mph and experience more than four times the force of
gravity.</TE>
<TE>   Javier Santos said his aunt and uncle were traumatized by their
daughter's death.</TE>
<TE>   "Pearl was very vibrant," he said. "She was the apple of her
daddy's eye."</TE>

<LD>A $1-million state grant will study how to prevent bird death by
electrocution.</LD>
<LD>   Nobody knows how many birds are killed by power lines each year,
but people who study it put the toll in the thousands. Researchers
led by the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group will study the
deaths and seek ways to prevent them.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not a population problem; it's an individual bird-mortality
problem," said Brian Walton of the research group at UC Santa Cruz.</LD>
<TE>   Walton estimates that thousands of birds die each year from power
lines, including 50 golden eagles and hundreds of red-tailed hawks at
the Altamont wind farm.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Former motel handyman Cary Stayner pleaded innocent by reason of
insanity Wednesday to the 1999 killings of three Yosemite National
Park tourists, after his attorneys claimed he suffers from
obsessive-compulsive disorder and other mental illnesses.</LD>
<LD>   Stayner's attorneys had been laying the groundwork for an insanity
defense, but made the decision official after Superior Court Judge
Thomas Hastings rejected two new requests to throw Stayner's
confessions out of his upcoming trial.</LD>
<LD>   Hastings explained to Stayner that if he is convicted, a jury
would consider whether he was insane at the time of the killings.</LD>
<TE>   If he were to be found guilty but insane, he could be sentenced to
life in a mental institution. If he is found guilty and sane, Stayner
could be executed.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A housing development that made headlines when its owner evicted
hundreds of tenants has been sold. Pacifica Cos., a San Diego real
estate holding company, bought all 149 Santa Rosa homes owned by
billionaire Genshiro Kawamoto.</LD>
<LD>   The 30 families who were not evicted will be allowed to stay in
their homes. The sale agreement, which was closed Monday, will allow
renters to buy their homes from the new owner if they choose.</LD>
<LD>   Kawamoto caused a community uproar when he sent the eviction
notices in February. Renters complained that he uprooted a close-knit
neighborhood where people watched one another's children and played
football in the cul-de-sacs.</LD>
<TE>   Kawamoto settled a suit last month filed by a private lawyer for a
tenants association and the Sonoma County district attorney's office.
He agreed to repair furnaces, fix water problems and bring the houses
up to code. The settlement allowed renters to stay in their homes
until July 15.</TE>

<HD>Harry L. Sears, 82; N.J. Legislator Delivered Vesco's Money
to Nixon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MOUNT ARLINGTON, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Harry L. Sears, a former New Jersey legislator who delivered a
briefcase containing $200,000 from financier Robert Vesco to
President Nixon's reelection campaign in 1972, has died. He was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Sears died Friday at St. Claire's Hospital in Denville, N.J. The
cause of death was not reported, but relatives said he had been ill
for some time.</LD>
<LD>   Sears was elected to the state Assembly in 1962 and served there
until 1968, when he won his state Senate seat.</LD>
<TE>   While Senate majority leader in 1970-71, he helped pass
legislation to create the Meadowlands sports complex and authorize a
state lottery. He unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for
governor in 1969 and left the Senate in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   Sears ran Nixon's reelection campaign that year in New Jersey and
was indicted on charges of helping Vesco buy his way out of an
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Vesco was a
law client of Sears.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell and Commerce Secretary Maurice H.
Stans were indicted along with Sears. Mitchell and Stans were
eventually acquitted.</TE>
<TE>   Sears was granted full immunity in return for testifying for the
prosecution. Prosecutors did not get as much help as they sought,
however, and tried unsuccessfully to have Sears treated as a hostile
witness.</TE>
<TE>   Vesco fled to several countries, and was convicted in a Cuban
court in 1996 of fraud. Cuba has refused to extradite Vesco to the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   After the Vesco case, Sears was suspended from practicing law for
three years. He later became a partner in the law firm of Sears,
Sweeney &amp; Marcickiewicz, working there until he retired in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Butler, N.J., Sears graduated from Tusculum College in
Greeneville, Tenn., and Rutgers Law School.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife; a sister; four daughters; a son; 13
grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>MTA Sector Bus Plan Lacks Key Details as Roll-Out Nears</HD>
<DH>Transit: The agency will decentralize control of the fleet
July 1, but budget formulas, goals, boundaries, governing structures
of the five regions aren't settled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER and CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is just weeks away from
embarking on a dramatic internal shift: a move to push control of the
agency's bus fleet from its towering downtown headquarters into five
regions spread through most of Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   Leaders at the MTA tout the move as a way to cut costs, improve
service and become more responsive. They say the nation's
second-biggest transit agency will be able, for example, to
creatively change routes in a bus system that looks much the same as
it did in the 1960s, despite massive changes in demographics and new
cultural and job centers.</LD>
<LD>   But there is a good chance that when the new bus system rolls out
July 1--initially in the San Gabriel and San Fernando valleys and a
few months later in other areas--such important details as budget
formulas, performance goals, boundaries and how the newfound bus
regions will be governed won't be set.</LD>
<TE>   That's a fact that is fraying nerves among groups involved with
the plan.</TE>
<TE>   The transit agency's labor unions and the grass-roots advocates
whose lawsuit forced the agency into a federal consent decree to
improve the bus fleet are seeking answers, worried the plan could
harm their interests.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles officials are nervous that the plan will take power
away from the city. San Fernando Valley leaders say if they don't end
up with real local control, they'll resume proceedings to establish
their own bus system.</TE>
<TE>   And some on the 13-member board that controls the MTA and its
$2.6-billion budget are unsettled. The board recently began meeting
to take a hard look at the plan, and though overwhelmingly
supportive, some worry that they don't have nearly enough facts and
figures.</TE>
<TE>   "They are moving on certain aspects of the plan piecemeal, and
that's bothersome," board member Paul Hudson said. "For instance, how
much real local control are we as a larger board going to give to the
boards governing the sectors? That is an issue that, unfortunately,
seems to have been put off."</TE>
<TE>   The broad outlines of the plan are known. Bus service and planning
for most MTA routes will be controlled by business units in five
geographic "sectors": the San Fernando Valley (from Glendale to
Westlake Village), the San Gabriel Valley, the Long Beach area, the
Torrance area and a swath from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   MTA headquarters, which is rapidly streamlining and has cut 46
positions since December, will oversee the rail system and operation
of the long distance buses that crisscross the city, though MTA chief
Roger Snoble, who came to the agency seven months ago vowing change,
is still tinkering with the idea of ceding part of the regional
service to the local bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Each sector will be given a set budget and a fleet of about 500
buses and told to be innovative, producing better service and lower
costs, or face firings.</TE>
<TE>   On the hot seat will be the sector general managers, all five of
whom have been hired, most lured from smaller bus companies for
salaries that reach as high as $168,000. They're each likely to
manage a budget of at least $100 million, although a formula for
figuring out how much money they receive beyond this year is one of
the unsettled issues causing concern.</TE>
<TE>   MTA officials envision managers better able to figure out where
money is being wasted, and better able to motivate a work force they
will know intimately. That will produce cleaner buses that break down
less and run on time, a boon to an elaborate system that has
1.2million boardings each weekday, they say.</TE>
<TE>   And planners, most of whom will relocate from headquarters to the
sectors, will be able to better understand their areas. That should
create service that interfaces better with the region's many smaller
bus systems, has improved routes to new job and entertainment
centers, and drops riders at rail stops just in time for waiting
trains.</TE>
<TE>   "Sitting in this tower," said Snoble, gazing out the window of his
25th-floor office, "we're just too far away."</TE>
<TE>   Far from seeing the final details of the plan is the MTA board,
which after setting the size of the local boards at roughly nine,
decided recently that it would be willing to cede a great deal of
control to the sectors.</TE>
<TE>   Yet exactly what that means--whether the local boards will have
much power beyond mapping out new bus routes, for instance--is
unclear, say some on the board who want to delegate as much power as
possible.</TE>
<TE>   "That hasn't been figured out yet. We haven't really gone through
it," board member Allison Yoh said. "That's one reason I'd like to
see this slow down a bit."</TE>
<TE>   Snoble admitted that agency staffers are working on several
important fronts, including the sector budgets and performance
measures, which the agency chief wants overhauled.</TE>
<TE>   Transit officials and advocates in the San Fernando Valley eagerly
await resolution of the issues. There, Zev Yaroslavsky, county
supervisor and MTA board member, has put himself in the seemingly
conflicting position of leading a group that has been studying the
creation of a "zone," essentially a transit agency completely
separate from the MTA.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky, who says he is backing the sector plan for now, wants
the makeup of the sector board to essentially mirror the panel
studying the proposed zone. Yaroslavsky's board is made up of
representatives from Valley-area cities, mostly business and
political leaders.</TE>
<TE>   City Hall, however, is casting a wary eye at Yaroslavsky's push.
Mayor James K. Hahn wants to ensure that Los Angeles has the most
voting clout and representation, because it represents the bulk of
the riders in the proposed Valley sector.</TE>
<TE>   And the mayor is advocating that at least one seat on the board be
reserved for a citizen who relies on buses. That's an idea eagerly
embraced by transit advocates in the Valley such as Bart Reed, who
heads a nonprofit focusing on improving the MTA.</TE>
<TE>   "Keeping bus riders off the board means real power is not going to
the people who use the system," he said. "I don't think that was the
intent."</TE>

<HD>Police Chase Culminates in Fatal Shooting</HD>
<DH>Crime: Driver reportedly attempted to ram officers, refused
to surrender in Garden Grove.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Anaheim man was shot and killed by police Wednesday after he
refused to surrender at the end of a car chase, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Hoa Kieu Duong, 28, was fatally shot about 12:40 a.m. as he tried
to rock his car off the median of Valley View Street in Garden Grove,
where his vehicle became stuck after being bumped from behind in a
standard police maneuver to end pursuits.</LD>
<LD>   Duong was driving in Fullerton on Brookhurst Street near the
Riverside Freeway just after midnight when police tried to pull him
over for a traffic violation, said Lt. Scott Hamilton, Garden Grove
police spokesman.</LD>
<TE>   After running a license plates check, police realized that the
registered owner had an outstanding warrant for aggravated assault.</TE>
<TE>   As the chase proceeded along Valley View Street, a few blocks east
of the San Diego Freeway, a Fullerton police cruiser bumped the rear
of Duong's car, sending it onto the divider. Other cruisers caught up
and circled him.</TE>
<TE>   Duong was ordered to surrender, Hamilton said. After Duong
refused, officers reportedly tried to stop him by firing several
rounds from beanbag guns. But Duong tried to drive through the
blockade, Hamilton said, putting his car in reverse and drive.</TE>
<TE>   Two officers, one from Fullerton and one from Garden Grove, then
fired the fatal shots with their regular weapons, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point, officers felt their lives or those of other
officers were threatened, and they fired at the suspect," Hamilton
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County district attorney's office, which reviews all
police shootings, is investigating.</TE>

<HD>Second Lawsuit Filed in Teenager's Death</HD>
<DH>Courts: Victim's parents sue owners of house where she was
stabbed, as well as the accused assailant's parents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Deanna Maran's parents filed a wrongful death suit Wednesday against
the owners of the Westside home where their daughter was fatally
stabbed, as well as against the parents of the 17-year-old girl who
authorities say killed her.</LD>
<LD>   Among those named in the complaint were Shelley R. and Barbara H.
Hendler, the owners of the Thayer Avenue house where Maran was slain
at a Saturday night party last November attended by a few dozen young
people, mostly minors. Katrina Sarkissian, the girl arrested in
connection with Maran's death, committed suicide.</LD>
<LD>   Also named were Angelique Sarkissian Bernstein and Sarkis
Sarkissian, the divorced parents of Sarkissian; Matthew Bernstein,
Sarkissian's stepfather; and her younger half-sister, whose scuffle
with Maran triggered the stabbing.</LD>
<TE>   The suit was filed in Santa Monica Superior Court by attorney
Anthony Michael Glassman on behalf of Ilja and Harriet Maran, parents
of the slain Santa Monica High School sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   "This action arises from the tragic murder of 15-year-old Deanna
Maran which occurred at an unsupervised party in Westwood," the suit
begins. "Deanna's last words were 'Please, let me tell my side of the
story.' [Her parents] bring this action to insure that Deanna's side
of the story is heard."</TE>
<TE>   The suit is the second legal action in the case. Last week,
Katrina Sarkissian's parents filed a wrongful death claim against Los
Angeles police, alleging that the girl would have survived if
detectives had not delayed seeking medical help after she collapsed
while in their custody the day after the party. An autopsy showed
that she had taken an overdose of antidepressant capsules.</TE>
<TE>   A Long Beach attorney for the Hendlers said he plans to allow the
plaintiffs to interview witnesses and then will ask the court to
dismiss the suit.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe there is any evidence whatsoever that my clients
were guilty of any sort of negligence or caused or contributed to
this incident," said Robert Armstrong, the attorney.</TE>
<TE>   The Hendlers were out of town the night of the party, according to
Armstrong. Their sons--Scott, a UC San Diego student, and his younger
brother, a minor--were at home with a housekeeper.</TE>
<TE>   According to the complaint, alcohol was served or readily
available at the party, and many of those present were drinking.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint alleges that the Hendlers failed to adequately
supervise the activities of their children and to ensure that their
home was used in a safe manner.</TE>
<TE>   The suit further alleges that Angelique Sarkissian Bernstein,
Matthew Bernstein and Sarkis Sarkissian failed to properly supervise
Katrina Sarkissian despite "a history of emotional instability and
violent behavior."</TE>
<TE>   The suit further claims that Katrina's younger half-sister
conspired with Katrina to dispose of the murder weapon, which
authorities have said was probably a knife. No weapon was found.</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein, a Los Angeles ophthalmologist, said he was not
surprised that the Marans' attorney would sue him along with
Katrina's parents.</TE>
<TE>   "He thinks I'm a rich doctor, but he'll find out I'm a poor
doctor," he said. Bernstein added that he is in bankruptcy
proceedings because he has spent more than $500,000 on legal fees in
connection with his divorce from Angelique Sarkissian Bernstein.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Casselman, a lawyer for Angelique Bernstein and Sarkis
Sarkissian, a wealthy real estate investor, said: "This is certainly
a tragedy all the way around, but many of the allegations are
inaccurate and poorly researched."</TE>
<TE>   The suit seeks unspecified damages, including punitive damages.</TE>

<HD>Crew Flees After Fire Aboard U.S. Sub</HD>
<DH>Accident: No one is seriously injured as 41 sailors are
removed by boat in choppy seas. Coast Guard rescues two more from
water.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>An uncontrollable fire and flooding aboard a Navy research submarine
100 miles from San Diego forced the captain to order crew members to
abandon ship in heavy seas early Wednesday morning, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Forty-one crew members of the Dolphin, the oldest active submarine
in the Navy, were evacuated about 2 a.m. from the submarine to a boat
launched from a nearby oceanographic vessel. Two others were plucked
from the choppy sea by a rescue swimmer dropped from a Coast Guard
helicopter.</LD>
<LD>   Navy officials at the submarine base at Point Loma said that it
was unclear how the fire started or the extent of the damage to the
submarine, which holds a series of performance records for the Navy.
None of the sailors suffered injuries beyond "scrapes and bruises,"
officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Navy and civilian salvage specialists were on ships adjacent to
the Dolphin throughout Wednesday to determine how the sub, which
remains on the surface, could be towed back to its home port. Crew
members were brought back aboard the oceanographic ship William A.
McGaw, used by the U.S. Geological Survey.</TE>
<TE>   Cmdr. Christopher D. Orwoll, the Dolphin's executive officer,
praised the "absolute professionalism and bravery" of the crew in
fighting the fire and flooding for three hours before the
abandon-ship order was given.</TE>
<TE>   The fire erupted while the Dolphin was on the surface to recharge
its batteries during a multi-ship mission to test new methods of
launching torpedoes.</TE>
<TE>   "Their extraordinary efforts ensured the safe recovery of the
entire crew and stabilization of the vessel," Orwoll said.</TE>
<TE>   The Dolphin, commissioned in 1968, is the last diesel-powered
submarine in the U.S. fleet. For more than three decades, it has been
used as a research vessel to test innovations in communications,
sonar, weaponry and surveillance. It is the only submarine in the
Navy with that capability.</TE>
<TE>   Fire aboard any ship at sea is dangerous. But aboard a submarine
it can be "a nightmare scenario," said retired submarine skipper
Harry Mathis. "You're so confined and the smoke travels so quickly.
Basically, you're inside the fire while you're fighting it."</TE>
<TE>   Submarine crews go through extensive training ashore on
firefighting and undergo repeated drills at sea. Submarines are
constructed with water-tight hatches between compartments to help
isolate fire and keep it from spreading.</TE>
<TE>   "If they had to evacuate the entire boat, you know it was
serious," Mathis said.</TE>
<TE>   The Dolphin is assigned to the Space and Naval Warfare Systems
Command in San Diego, a test facility.</TE>
<TE>   At 165 feet in length, the Dolphin is roughly half the size of
attack submarines, which are equipped with Tomahawk missiles and
other weaponry.</TE>
<TE>   As a diesel submarine, the Dolphin needs to make trips to the
surface every few hours so that its diesel engines can get oxygen
needed to recharge the boat's batteries. Other submarines are
nuclear-powered and can stay beneath the surface for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Abandon-ship orders have been extraordinarily rare. On Wednesday,
that decision had to be made by the Dolphin's skipper, Cmdr. Stephen
Z. Kelety. There was not time to consult with higher-ups, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Dolphin holds a number of records for the U.S. Navy, including
the deepest dive ever made by a submarine (more than 3,000 feet),
deepest launch of a torpedo and deepest use of e-mail communication
back to a surface location.</TE>
<TE>   Although much of what the Dolphin has done is still top-secret, it
is known that it assisted in developing surveillance systems during
the Cold War when U.S. submarines continuously tracked and
eavesdropped on Soviet submarines.</TE>
<TE>   "The Dolphin is a unique and very important boat," Mathis said.</TE>

<HD>Airports Expect Big Holiday Weekend</HD>
<DH>Travel: They brace for the largest crowds since Sept. 11.
Surge could last all summer, officials say.</DH>

<LD>Attention Memorial Day travelers: This weekend is expected to be the
busiest the nation's airports have seen since the terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Starting Friday, officials at Los Angeles International Airport
and other facilities across the nation will begin bracing for what
they predict will be a summer filled with elbow-to-elbow crowds.</LD>
<LD>   Although passenger traffic at LAX is expected to be down by 15%
this weekend compared with last year, officials urge travelers to
allow more time than usual at the airport to check in for their
flights and go through security.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the smaller number of passengers, officials expect airport
curbs, ticket counters and baggage-claim areas to be more crowded
this summer because of new rules that don't allow "meeters and
greeters" past security checkpoints. In addition, many people will be
flying for the first time since the September skyjackings and will be
unaware of the new security procedures, slowing the entire system
down.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. airport's remote parking sites, lots B and C, are
expected to fill up.</TE>
<TE>   "This weekend is going to outdo Thanksgiving and Christmas," said
Paul Haney, an airport spokesman. "It's a function of airline
schedules being more robust, with more flights and more seats."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the sluggish economy, more than the aftereffects of the
terrorist attacks, will prompt most Americans to drive rather than
fly to their summer vacation destinations. About 76% of travelers
this summer will rely on an automobile, said Carol Thorp, a
spokeswoman for the Automobile Club of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Travel by all modes of transportation this summer is expected to
be up 2% over last year, Thorp said, although trips by air are
projected to be off 3% from the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the travel recovery, passenger traffic at LAX has not
rebounded as quickly as at other major airports and even smaller ones
in Southern California, such as John Wayne Airport and Burbank
Airport--where loads are approaching last year's levels. Passenger
traffic at LAX from Memorial Day through Labor Day is expected to
fall about 15%, from a record 20.5 million travelers last year to
17.4 million this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, airport officials hope that several new services will
ease overcrowding and help LAX overcome an image it has had
difficulty shaking since the terrorist attacks: that it is less
user-friendly than its smaller counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   To combat long lines at security checkpoints, the federal
Transportation Security Administration has added more lanes at
Terminals No. 1, 4, 7 and the Tom Bradley International Terminal.</TE>
<TE>   To help with queues at ticket counters, the airport's major
airlines have installed automated systems that allow passengers with
electronic tickets to bypass long check-in lines by putting a credit
card in the machine and following steps to check their bags and get
boarding passes.</TE>
<TE>   LAX also will inaugurate a new program this weekend that features
"ambassadors" stationed at the facility's terminals to assist
passengers with directions and other questions. About 33 ambassadors
sporting blue windbreakers, white visors and a gold badge that says,
"LAX Ambassador. May I Help You?" will patrol the airport's arrival
and departure decks.</TE>
<TE>   Ambassadors, who range in age from 18 to 75, have been training at
terminals in two shifts, from 6 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and 1:30 p.m. to 9
p.m. Some have helped as many as 500 passengers during one shift,
said Barbara Yamamoto, director of community relations for the city
agency that operates LAX.</TE>
<TE>   "For a lot of people, LAX is their first and last impression of
Los Angeles, so we have to make sure it's a good one," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The airport hopes eventually to have 80 ambassadors. The $500,000
program is scheduled to run through September, but could be extended
if it proves popular, Yamamoto said. Ambassadors, many of whom are
former airline employees, said they have fielded questions ranging
from "Which bus goes to Van Nuys?" to "Where is Terminal No. 7?"</TE>
<TE>   "There's no job description for us, other than easing passengers'
travel," said Cynthia Cory, a former Northwest Airlines employee.</TE>

<HD>Promoting Serenity Amid Urban Hub</HD>
<DH>In the middle of a $1-billion overhaul, 160-acre L.A. park
hypes its diverse features to lure locals and tourists.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The three girls from remote Lassen County don't realize it. But Kayla
Kokkonen, Elin Kuzmack and Constance Diaz are exactly whom the people
reinventing Los Angeles' most ambitious public park are looking for.</LD>
<LD>   The 12-year-olds breezed into Exposition Park this week for the
state Science Fair to display their junior high research project. It
dealt with making tomato plants grow in a cold, windy climate--like
theirs, in Northern California's eastern mountains.</LD>
<LD>   The girls' cardboard-sided exhibit was one of 855 school projects
being shown on folding tables lining the three floors of the state's
California Science Center. The three couldn't wait to get it set up
so they could explore the 5-year-old center, known for its
kid-friendly displays and exhibits.</LD>
<TE>   After that, they planned to check out the city's Rose Garden, said
to be the country's largest, and the county's Natural History Museum
next door. Finally--before heading off to Disneyland and the Getty
Center--they planned to peek through the locked gate at the
city-county-state-run Memorial Coliseum, the scene of many famous
events over seven decades.</TE>
<TE>   "Just walking in the door, I went, 'Whoa!'" Kayla said of the
$85-million Science Center. A stately, old-looking brick exterior
hides its high-tech, airy interior.</TE>
<TE>   That blend of old and new--and that enthusiastic visitor
reaction--is what Exposition Park officials are seeking as they near
the midpoint of a $1-billion overhaul of the 160-acre park that began
as Agricultural Park, a mile south of downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in its 126-year history, its three owners--the
city, county and state--are working together to promote its diverse
features to local residents and tourists.</TE>
<TE>   The new "branding campaign," as park operators call it, may be
just in time. New downtown attractions ranging from Staples Center
and Disney Hall to a proposed professional football stadium are
already stealing luster from the "EXP," the new nickname designed to
show that "X" marks the spot for Exposition Park.</TE>
<TE>   What little promotion that has been done for Exposition Park has
come from its individual tenants: the Science Center, Coliseum and
Sports Arena, Natural History Museum, African American Museum, Swim
Stadium and Rose Garden.</TE>
<TE>   "Our strategy now is to use our collective synergies," says Jon
Gibby, Exposition Park's acting manager. "We already have 4 million
visitors a year. With that kind of world-class profile, we feel we
truly are at the literal and figurative crossroads of the L.A.
market."</TE>
<TE>   Gibby, 47, of Granada Hills is a former Bank of America and Unocal
corporate affairs manager who for 20 years helped give away more than
$50 million of company money to grant-seekers. He was appointed nine
months ago by Gov. Gray Davis and reports to a nine-member park board
of directors who are also appointees of the governor.</TE>
<TE>   The state is the primary manager of Exposition Park because it
owns 120 of its acres, Gibby said. And because of the evolving nature
of the park, his is not just a caretaker's role.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly a decade, the park has seemingly always been under
construction. The latest phase of work, however, could have the most
impact on visitors:</TE>
<TE>   * Construction of a $30-million, 2,100-space parking structure
over the site of a 650-space surface lot near the front of the
Coliseum will begin soon. It will free up other asphalt parking areas
on the park grounds for other uses. The new lot will open in 2004 and
will be accompanied by a new Figueroa Street entrance.</TE>
<TE>   * Conversion has begun of the park's 90-year-old armory building
near the corner of Exposition Boulevard and Figueroa into a
$24.3-million public charter school. The 850-pupil elementary campus
will specialize in science when it opens in 2004. The school will be
run in conjunction with a new $27.7-million Center for Science
Learning. It will operate in partnership with the Science Center and
nearby USC, which will train teachers there.</TE>
<TE>   * Development of a $30-million recreation complex next to the
city's 1932 Olympic Swim Stadium is underway. The 80,000-square-foot
Exposition Park Intergenerational Community Center will have
facilities for senior citizens and children but will specialize as a
swim training center. It will be Los Angeles' largest recreational
center when city parks officials and four private partners finish it
next year.</TE>
<TE>   * A new grassy park and promenade area will be built near the
corner of Martin Luther King Boulevard and Vermont Avenue in 2004 to
help link the nearby residential neighborhood with the new community
center.</TE>
<TE>   Other expansion projects planned as part of a 1993 Exposition Park
master plan are scheduled to get underway next year and in 2004. They
include the three-year development of a $110-million second phase of
the Science Center and the construction of a "museum walk" that would
connect the Science Center, the African American Museum and the
Natural History Museum.</TE>
<TE>   A three-year modernization project for the circa-1913 Natural
History Museum is proposed to begin in 2006 and will cost $200
million to $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   Nearing completion is an interior renovation project at the
African American Museum, which was chartered in 1977, and the
$7.5-million seismic retrofitting of the spaceship-shaped Sports
Arena, which first opened in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers professional basketball team, which used to play at
the Sports Arena, now uses the Staples Center. But the 15,000-seat
Sports Arena stays busy as a venue for concerts and USC men's and
women's basketball games, Gibby said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, officials hope the new "EXP" marketing effort--being
handled for free by Rogers &amp; Associates, Vigon/Ellis Inc. and DDB
Worldwide Communications Group--will help draw new users to the arena
and the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the new football stadium being talked about for a site
near Staples Center, the 92,516-seat Memorial Coliseum remains
viable, Gibby said.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1923, the Coliseum is historic: It's the only sports
venue in the world that has hosted two Olympic Games, two Super Bowls
and a World Series, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, "we need to be successful with what we do. We need
more signature events at the park," Gibby acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so. But Erik Garcia and Ted Bradshaw might disagree.
Exposition Park seemed to be their private, personal refuges this
week as the two enjoyed themselves less than 500 yards apart.</TE>
<TE>   Nine-year-old Erik, a Pico Rivera third-grader, was panting with
excitement and perhaps a little exhaustion after negotiating a
two-story mock cliff-climbing wall inside the Science Center. "I love
this place," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Outside in the 76-year-old Exposition Park Rose Garden, Bradshaw,
a middle-aged social caseworker from Compton, was quietly meditating
among the 15,000 rose bushes.</TE>
<TE>   "This place is serene and safe and inspirational. It's surrounded
by such diverse culture in the hub of the city," Bradshaw said. "And
the amazing part is, it's free."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that should be part of Exposition Park's new marketing
campaign.</TE>

<HD>Teacher Enters Not Guilty Plea in Youth's Abduction</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A San Bernardino teacher accused in the abduction of a student with
whom she allegedly had a relationship pleaded not guilty Wednesday in
Las Vegas and remains jailed on $280,000 bail, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Tanya Hadden entered the plea at her arraignment, when she was
charged with 19 criminal counts, said Clark County Deputy Dist. Atty.
Lisa Luzaich.</LD>
<LD>   Hadden is charged with six counts of statutory sexual seduction,
12 counts of sexual conduct between a school employee and a pupil and
one count of first-degree kidnapping.</LD>
<TE>   Her trial is scheduled to begin July 22.</TE>
<TE>   Hadden, 33, a former Cajon High School teacher, is also expected
to face charges in San Bernardino County, officials have said.</TE>
<TE>   Late last month, she and 15-year-old Richard Pena, one of her
students, were discovered together in a Las Vegas hotel. They fled
together after police began investigating whether Hadden had served
alcohol to Pena and another student at a party, investigators say.</TE>

<HD>Parents Seek Principal's Ouster for 'English Only' Request</HD>
<DH>Education: She is accused of racism at the Pacoima school,
which is 98% Latino.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Parents at Pacoima's Telfair Elementary School, with a 98% Latino
student body, are calling for the principal's resignation, accusing
her of racism after she asked parents to speak only English to their
children.</LD>
<LD>   The request by Principal Stannis Steinbeck came at a May 3 parent
and faculty meeting, district officials said. A few days later, some
parents began a petition drive to have Steinbeck removed. So far, 160
names have been gathered.</LD>
<LD>   "She wants the parents to be a model for their kids and help out
by speaking more English," said Alma Sanchez, director of school
support for Los Angeles Unified School District's Subdistrict B.</LD>
<TE>   Steinbeck declined requests for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez said Steinbeck sent letters of apology to parents Friday
and also plans to meet individually with parents to clear the air.</TE>
<TE>   "No one has the right to take your language away," said Armando
Sandoval, speaking on behalf of parents.</TE>
<TE>   "Spanish is the only language most of these parents know," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Of Telfair's 1,278 students, English is not the first language for
934.</TE>
<TE>   The school is one of 15 in Subdistrict B being closely monitored
because of low academic performance.</TE>
<TE>   Since Steinbeck was appointed principal a year and a half ago,
test scores have risen, federal and state grants have been received
and the campus has undergone some modernization, Sanchez said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a completely isolated incident," Sanchez said of
Steinbeck's comments at the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Sandoval, whose 8-year-old son attends the school, said there has
been tension on campus since Steinbeck arrived because of a perceived
lack of sensitivity toward the Latino community. "We need someone who
gets involved with the community.... we need someone who's bilingual.
We don't care about race. We need a moral leader for the kids," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Parents also are contacting local politicians, including City
Council President Alex Padilla, a Telfair alumnus, who has scheduled
a meeting with parents and faculty.</TE>
<TE>   School board member David Tokofsky, whose district includes
Telfair, said Steinbeck wants to improve students' English skills but
may have been too abrasive.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Takes Aim at Thrift, Discount Stores</HD>
<DH>Retail: Downtown is now off-limits to new cut-rate
businesses. Owners and customers criticize the crackdown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attempting to clean up storefronts and continue the renovation of
downtown Oxnard, the City Council is prohibiting new thrift or
discount stores from opening downtown and making it more difficult
for such stores to open elsewhere in the city.</LD>
<LD>   Some store owners feel unfairly singled out, and their
value-conscious customers worry that the recent council actions will
make it more difficult to find a bargain.</LD>
<LD>   City officials say cluttered windows, dirty exteriors, smelly used
clothing and handwritten cardboard signs prompted the city to
investigate how the popular stores are being operated.</LD>
<TE>   City staff identified about 30 "thrift stores" offering
second-hand items and "discount" stores offering new items for less
than $2. Staff members also found windows blocked by products and
signs, cluttered displays, unwanted merchandise stored outside and
used clothing that hadn't been properly laundered.</TE>
<TE>   "The intent [of the crackdown] is to still allow them, but that
they keep their appearance up," Oxnard planning manager Marilyn
Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the City Council voted to ban new stores that
sell used merchandise from opening downtown. On Tuesday night, the
council approved an ordinance extending the ban to new discount
stores--defined by the ordinance as establishments that sell most of
their products for less than $2--in the central business district,
which is between 2nd Street and Wooley Road.</TE>
<TE>   The ordinance also prevents existing downtown thrift and discount
stores that cease operating for 30 days from reopening.</TE>
<TE>   The council's action Tuesday also subjects retailers seeking to
open thrift or discount stores in other parts of the city to added
requirements. Such stores would have to obtain a use permit, which
requires a public hearing, and comply with aesthetic standards.</TE>
<TE>   "They shouldn't make it more difficult to open a store. The way we
operate is what works," said Angelica Reyes of Reyes 99 Cents and
More store in downtown. The city report criticized the Reyes store
for having its windows blocked by items for sale, but Reyes said her
mostly Latino shoppers enjoy viewing products from the street.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new ordinance, which takes effect next month, incoming
discount retailers must keep windows clear of any materials that
block visibility into the store, while thrift stores will now be
required to launder or dry-clean all used clothes before resale.</TE>
<TE>   "Government shouldn't be meddling in the free-enterprise system,"
said Michael Pliske, chairman of the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce. "You
can't force the economy."</TE>
<TE>   Pliske, who is also president of the Oxnard Harbor District's
board of commissioners, said the city may have good intentions, but
officials should support businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "Ventura in downtown used to be trashy with crummy thrift stores,
and pretty soon you started seeing very nice antique stores. Look at
it now," Pliske said, adding that Oxnard "should encourage business
rather than pick and choose."</TE>
<TE>   Store owners say they are just trying to make sales. Eduardo
Navarro, who recently purchased a discount shop in downtown Oxnard,
said he supports clean stores but is becoming weary of city officials
who have visited him nine times in the three months he has been open.</TE>
<TE>   His store, 99 Cents and More, y Mas, offers most products for
under $2, including household cleaners, drinks, party favors and
gifts. But Navarro plans to change the name of the store to Lalo's
General Merchandise to avoid the negative impressions that some
officials have of 99-cent stores, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to make a living and be successful," Navarro said.</TE>
<TE>   Other retailers are upset that now they will be shut out of
downtown altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "Oxnard is the first city in America that has made it illegal to
have good buys," said Russ Wolpert, a vice president of
Commerce-based 99 Cents Only Stores, which operates a store in the
northern part of the city and has outlets in Ventura, Camarillo, Port
Hueneme and Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   With more than 130 stores in Southern California, Phoenix and Las
Vegas, each 99 Cents Only Store averaged $4.6 million in sales last
year, Wolpert said, and should be an attractive retailer to any city.
For some Oxnard families, the stores are their only option.</TE>
<TE>   At Luna's Thrift Store on Oxnard Boulevard, Francisco Centeno
sifted through racks of clothes. "We come here a few times a week.
You can always find good clothes, and cheap," Margarita Centeno said.
With her husband's earnings as a gardener and a part-time assistant
at a fast-food restaurant, the family cannot afford to shop at malls,
she said.</TE>

<HD>Big Rig's Load Strikes Bridge</HD>
<DH>Highways: Riverside man is hurt by falling debris in Orange
County accident that closed tollway's southbound lanes for much of
Wednesday.</DH>

<LD>A tractor-trailer hauling a bulldozer struck a bridge that was under
construction on the California 241 tollway in Rancho Santa Margarita
early Wednesday, raining debris that injured a worker at the site and
forcing the closure of the road's southbound lanes.</LD>
<LD>   The big rig's driver, a 47-year-old Huntington Beach man who
escaped injury, did not have a permit to carry an oversized load on
the tollway and apparently had taken a detour from his approved route
to avoid congestion on the Santa Ana Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   The construction worker-- identified only as a 36-year-old
Riverside man--was transported to Mission Viejo Hospital with
moderate injuries, the California Highway Patrol reported.</LD>
<TE>   The truck, owned by Marco Rental of Santa Ana, was traveling about
50 mph in the middle southbound lane of the tollway when the
bulldozer strapped to the trailer bed slammed into the Avenida de las
Banderas bridge about 7:30 a.m., according to the CHP.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans, which issues permits that determine the routes for all
rigs taller than 14 feet, said it restricted the driver from the
tollway because the 15-foot, 9-inch load they were told he would be
carrying was one inch too tall to clear the overpass.</TE>
<TE>   The load turned out to be closer to 17 feet, Caltrans said, too
tall to squeeze under several crossings he would have encountered
even had he stayed on his assigned route.</TE>
<TE>   The approved permit directed the driver to travel on the 91 Orange
and Santa Ana freeways, said Caltrans spokeswoman Beth Beeman.
However, Caltrans did not give the origin or destination of the
driver.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a case of a driver that was going on a roadway he wasn't
permitted to travel on," she said. "This isn't a Caltrans issue."</TE>
<TE>   The transportation department came under increased scrutiny in the
late 1990s for the way it issued truck permits after a series of
accidents--including one that resulted in a death--exposed flaws in
the system. The agency says it has since improved the process.</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with standard policy, Marco Rental's permit for that
route was automatically pulled by Caltrans. The driver was also
ticketed by the CHP for violating his permit. Officials at Marco
Rental could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The tollway's southbound lanes were reopened late Wednesday
afternoon.</TE>

<HD>2 Who Joined Siege Must Reapply to UC</HD>
<DH>West Bank: Officials say the students, still held by
Israel, broke rules for overseas study.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two University of California students who entered Bethlehem's Church
of the Nativity during the recent siege have been dropped from their
overseas studies program and must apply to re-enroll at the
university in the fall, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   UC officials said the two student activists, who are being held in
an Israeli prison, were dropped because they violated the
university's rules for students studying abroad when they rushed past
Israeli soldiers on May 2 and joined Palestinians inside the besieged
church. Specifically, their risky behavior violated safety standards
that students agree to follow when enrolling in the program, the
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The standoff at the church ended May 10, but five Americans,
including UC Riverside student Nauman Zaidi and UC Berkeley student
Robert O'Neill, remained in Israeli custody Wednesday, according to
Israeli and U.S. officials.</LD>
<TE>   The officials said the group, made up of activists with the
pro-Palestinian International Solidarity Movement, is fighting
Israel's plans to deport them. In addition, a State Department
spokesman said the Americans are still being held because they have
insisted that, if deported, they be allowed to return to Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "They want a guarantee that they will be able to return and Israel
is not going to concede that. If they agreed, they could leave
tomorrow," said the spokesman, who asked not to be identified, citing
State Department protocol.</TE>
<TE>   But an Israeli attorney representing the group said Wednesday that
they are willing to leave Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "Politically and philosophically, they oppose being deported, but
they are not going to physically resist being put on a plane,"
attorney Allegra Pacheco said in a telephone interview. "It's an
absurd situation that they're still being held."</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco accused American officials in Israel of not pushing hard
enough to gain the group's release. U.S. officials in Israel could
not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Zaidi, 26, from Rancho Cucamonga, and O'Neill, 21, of Claremont,
have been studying this year at the American University of Cairo
under the University of California's education abroad program. The
two spent their spring break working as volunteers with the
solidarity group, a West Bank-based organization that says it works
to raise awareness of the Palestinian cause.</TE>
<TE>   UC officials said Wednesday that the two have been dropped from
the overseas studies program but that they have not been expelled
from the university. They will have to reapply at their respective
schools, but are likely to be readmitted, the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "They have not been withdrawn from the university," said John
Marcum, director of UC's education abroad program. "They are still UC
students, but they have, in effect, violated the rules of the game"
for the overseas programs.</TE>
<TE>   Zaidi's father said the university's decision has only added to
his worries about his son.</TE>
<TE>   Nasim Zaidi said he had been told by officials with the U.S.
embassy in Tel Aviv that Nauman has been moved into a more
restrictive part of the prison and no longer has access to a
telephone.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Zaidi said the family had spoken to Nauman every few
days since his imprisonment, but never for more than a moment or two.
But "we have not been able to talk to him for four days and we are so
worried," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want him back as soon as possible," Zaidi said of his son, who
is a biological sciences major at the Riverside campus.</TE>
<TE>   Now, if he could, he said, he would urge Nauman to give up any
challenge to the Israeli government.</TE>
<TE>   "I would tell him he's wasting his time. He is not achieving
anything by sitting in prison. He has a future to take care of and
now he's been dropped by the educational program," Zaidi said. "He
has to come home."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill's father, Richard, said university officials had been
sympathetic to his son's plight but felt they had to drop him from
the overseas program for liability reasons.</TE>
<TE>   The university doesn't "embrace the idea of these kids being in
harm's way," the elder O'Neill said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill said he spoke to his son Wednesday by telephone, finding
him "disillusioned, dispirited, angry, but determined that his
[pro-Palestinian] cause is the correct one."</TE>
<TE>   Robert O'Neill is a Middle Eastern studies and anthropology major
a few courses from graduation, his father said.</TE>
<TE>   Marcum said Zaidi and O'Neill had misled university officials by
saying they were spending spring break in Egypt and then further
violated university and State Department guidelines by traveling to
the West Bank, crossing Israel's military lines and entering the
besieged church. The university rules provide, among other things,
that they not endanger themselves or others.</TE>
<TE>   He said the university's decision was prompted in part by a desire
to keep future students from taking similar risks.</TE>
<TE>   "If we lay down a whole set of regulations and indicate that there
are certain things these students must not do, who's going to believe
us if we don't follow through when they don't?" Marcum said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, he said, "It's not exactly capital punishment."</TE>
<TE>   The students, who may continue their classes in Cairo as
independent students--once they are released from jail--will have to
arrange to transfer those credits back to UC, Marcum said.</TE>
<TE>   He said that the university, through its action, was not making a
judgment on Zaidi's or O'Neill's political views. "They can be as
fervent about these issues as they want to be," he said. "But by
breaking the rules, they endanger themselves, each other and our
programs."</TE>

<HD>Ventura Man, 20, Killed in Apparent Gang Shooting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jose Pimentel, described by his proud family as a hard worker and a
good son, was doing everything it took to move beyond the rough and
gritty west Ventura streets of his birth.</LD>
<LD>   The 20-year-old Ventura College student was working full time and
had aspirations of one day becoming a police officer, his family
said.</LD>
<LD>   But Pimentel's attempts to lift himself out of his working-class
surroundings came to a violent end Tuesday night.</LD>
<TE>   He was shot execution-style by an unknown assailant as he stood
with his cousin and friends in front of his uncle's Olive Street
home, a block from the public housing unit he shared with his parents
and two sisters. No one else was injured.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting was the latest in a surge of gang-related assaults in
Ventura and Oxnard since Monday night that have left two people dead
and three injured and spurred police in both cities to investigate
any possible connection. No arrests have been made.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they have no suspects in Pimentel's shooting, the
first gang-related killing in the city since 1999. They said there is
no evidence that the victim was a gang member or had gang ties.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't make any sense," said Sgt. Brock Avery of the Ventura
Police Department. "Why this person was chosen to be the victim we
don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Pimentel's family and friends gathered Wednesday morning at his
house and around the sidewalk where he was shot to retrace the events
of the night before and to remember the thick-haired kid they called
Sha-Na-Na.</TE>
<TE>   "I was telling him, 'Don't leave us, you can't leave us, Jose,'"
said Pimentel's cousin, Salvador Pimentel, 26, who narrowly missed
being shot by the gunman. "We have had shootings before, but nothing
directed at us."</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said the gunman, with a shaved head and baggy clothes,
approached Pimentel and his friends about 10:30 p.m. as they stood
talking near a white wrought-iron fence. As the gunman approached the
group, witnesses said, he fumbled in his right pants pocket before
drawing a semiautomatic handgun.</TE>
<TE>   He asked Pimentel and the others where they were from before
firing at least eight shots, Salvador Pimentel said. As the group
took cover, the gunman fled on foot but not before shouting his
allegiance to a well-known Oxnard street gang, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel Pimentel, 22, another cousin, witnessed the shooting from
an upstairs window. "He just froze when he saw everybody," he said of
the gunman. "Then he started shooting and everybody jumped back."</TE>
<TE>   The surge in violence in Oxnard and Ventura prompted Oxnard Police
Chief Art Lopez to call a meeting of investigators Wednesday to
discuss ways to stem the crime wave.</TE>
<TE>   He said there is no indication that Pimentel's shooting is related
to two earlier attacks in Oxnard-- the fatal stabbing Monday of a
15-year-old boy and a shooting Tuesday afternoon that sent three
youths to a hospital with leg wounds.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Lopez said he invited Ventura police to the meeting
because of references Pimentel's shooter allegedly made regarding an
Oxnard gang.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be a connection, but we are not certain," Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   According to friends, Pimentel's large, close-knit family has
worked hard to improve its west-side neighborhood, long plagued by
gangs and drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The home where Jose Pimentel was shot was purchased by his uncle
six years ago. With help from the families of the three Pimentel
brothers, the ramshackle house was renovated and transformed into a
source of pride, said Mike Del Dosso, president of the Westside
Community Council.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very troubling because you have a nice family who are
good people in the community," said Del Dosso, who spent part of
Wednesday morning scrubbing blood from the sidewalk. "You look at
what we have tried to do to curtail crime in the area. And then this
happens."</TE>
<TE>   A block away, family and friends crammed into the small
single-story apartment where Jose Pimentel lived with his parents and
sisters. They reminisced about their lost son and brother.</TE>
<TE>   They talked about how Pimentel worked five days a week for a beer
distributor in Goleta and spent the rest of his time working out at
the gym, cheering the Lakers and taking classes at Ventura College.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing gave him more pride than wearing his company's striped
uniform with a large red patch and logo stitched on the back and his
name embroidered over the front pocket, said his sister, Norma
Pimentel, 24.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes she would tease him about the big stripes on his
uniform, but it never bothered him, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "He would wear that uniform to the gym and would have lifted
weights in it if he could have," she said. "I will miss him. He was a
great brother."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors said Wednesday they will retry 22-year-old Ramiro Salgado
on murder charges in the September 1999 slaying of a Ventura man
beaten by gang members outside his apartment.</LD>
<LD>   A judge declared a mistrial earlier this month after jurors were
unable to decide whether Salgado was guilty of second-degree murder
for allegedly kicking and beating 18-year-old William Zara.</LD>
<LD>   Salgado's lawyer has filed a motion to dismiss the case. A hearing
is set for June.</LD>
<TE>   Zara died after being beaten and stabbed by gang members who
mistakenly thought he had reported their loud party to police. Four
other suspects were convicted of murder last year and are serving
life sentences.</TE>

<LD>The "och tamale" and the "gazump deyump" were a good start, but the
University of Redlands found its real salvation on the back of a 1980
Buick.</LD>
<LD>   An Arcadia man is scheduled today to deliver a California license
plate that reads "YAHOO" to the university. The plate's arrival
spells the end of a 12-year odyssey of sorts at the Inland Empire
campus. University administrators now own--and they insist they are
proud of this--license plates containing every word of the first line
of the school fight song.</LD>
<LD>   That might not be saying much if the song began, say, "Fight on
for ol' SC" or "Hail to the victors." But it's a big deal in
Redlands, where, in 1920, a student penned a cheer that began with
these hallowed words: "Och tamale gazolly gazump deyump deyatty
yahoo."</LD>
<TE>   First known as the "Psalm of Collegiate Thanksgiving," the chant
has become the university's de facto fight song and is heard today at
football games, pep rallies and alumni functions.</TE>
<TE>   The license plate game began about 1990 when university President
James R. Appleton arrived on campus one day with a plate reading
"OCTAMLE." A vice president followed suit with "GAZOLLY."</TE>
<TE>   Everything was progressing nicely--turns out "GAZUMP" was never in
high demand at the Department of Motor Vehicles--until it came time
to secure "YAHOO."</TE>
<TE>   That word had been taken for a license plate more than 25 years
ago, when Arcadia resident John Martin ordered it for his '65
Mustang. Even before it was delivered to Martin, the plate had become
famous--for a license plate.</TE>
<TE>   The state featured it, Martin said, on a television commercial
advertising California's shift in 1974 from black-and-yellow plates
to blue-and-gold plates (Lawrence Welk's "A1ANDA2" was also featured
on the commercial).</TE>
<TE>   "That car was one of the classics. It had horseshoes on the
bumper. So I figured I might as well go Western," said Martin, an
84-year-old retiree who still fancies cowboy boots and bolo ties.
"That's how the 'YAHOO' got started. It was a Western motif."</TE>
<TE>   And it remained that way for years, even after executives from
Yahoo!--the Internet company, not the fight song, nor the cowboy
exhortation--came calling for the plate in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Martin preferred to keep the plates, which by then he had moved to
his Buick Riviera.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, this spring, after university administrators tracked
Martin down through contacts at the Redlands Police Department, he
agreed that it was time to pass it on.</TE>
<TE>   The DMV allows vehicle owners to transfer a plate to another
owner, who must apply for it. License plates can also be sold along
with their cars, though they cannot legally be sold on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Martin and his wife of 60 years, Jeanie, have ordered new plates
that will read "JOHN65," and will pass "YAHOO" over to Redlands Dean
of Students Char Burgess, who will carry the plates on her Buick
Regal.</TE>
<TE>   In the university's administration building, it is seen as the end
of an era.</TE>
<TE>   "We all call our cars by their 'Och Tamale' name," said Linda
Granell, the school's director of public relations, whose car carries
"DEYUMP" plates. "We'll say, 'Gazolly is going into the shop.' I
don't know where we are going to go from here."</TE>
<TE>   They could just proceed to the second line of the song--which
reads, by the way, as follows: "Ink Damink Deyatty Gazink.... "</TE>

<HD>Angels Gain More Ground</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They rally from five runs down to beat Royals,
7-6, and move 11/2 games behind Mariners in AL West.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After four innings Wednesday night, the Angels trailed by five runs.</LD>
<LD>   After six, they had a mere two hits against the lowly Kansas City
Royals and had yet to score.</LD>
<LD>   Cue the seventh and eighth, and tip your cap to the Angels'
amazing run.</LD>
<TE>   With a two-run seventh and a five-run outburst in the eighth, the
Angels came back for a 7-6 victory in front of 16,163 at Edison
Field.</TE>
<TE>   Those five runs were the largest deficit they've overcome to win
this season.</TE>
<TE>   They're working on another deficit, too.</TE>
<TE>   Check the standings.</TE>
<TE>   After trailing Seattle by 101/2 games when their month-long hot
streak began, the Angels closed to only 11/2 back in the American
League West after the Mariners lost to Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have won 21 of their last 24 games, marking the best
24-game streak in club history.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys never think they're out of a game," Manager Mike
Scioscia said. "That's an element that has to be present on a
championship-caliber club."</TE>
<TE>   It's only May, true. But what a May it's been. (Throw the last
week of April in there, too.)</TE>
<TE>   "We're playing some baseball that's going to lead to momentum now
as opposed to the first 20 games," Scioscia said, alluding to the
6-14 start that was the worst in club history.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the drama of the comeback, it was still dicey at the end.</TE>
<TE>   After the eighth-inning rally that was capped by Garret Anderson's
two-run go-ahead double, Troy Percival came on to pitch the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Percival gave up a leadoff double to Luis Alicea, then retired
pinch-hitter Michael Tucker on a liner to first. But pinch-hitter
Raul Ibanez singled to drive in Alicea, cutting the lead to a
razor-thin one run.</TE>
<TE>   Percival struck out Neifi Perez for the second out then got Carlos
Febles on a called third strike to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   It was Percival's eighth save.</TE>
<TE>   The real heroics were in the seventh and eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I've been here, we've always been good at battling and
fighting and coming back and winning games, and we've been doing it a
lot lately," center fielder Darin Erstad said.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City right-hander Paul Byrd began the game with a 7-2
record that was most remarkable for this: He had recorded seven of
the 16 victories Kansas City has managed.</TE>
<TE>   For a while, he looked as if he was going to keep that trend
going.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have been shut out only once since their tear began,
and they weren't going to be shut out Wednesday, though Byrd gave it
a nice effort, changing speeds and hitting spots.</TE>
<TE>   With two out in the seventh, Brad Fullmer doubled to right-center,
and Tim Salmon drove a 2-2 pitch into the stands just inside the foul
pole in left, cutting the lead to 5-2 with his sixth homer.</TE>
<TE>   The end of Salmon's long slump--a slumber, really--has coincided
almost perfectly with the Angels' turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd went on to face two batters in the eighth, giving up a single
and a walk, before left-hander Darrell May relieved him with none
out.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' Adam Kennedy got things rolling with a fly ball that
fell in near the left-field line to drive in the first run of the
eighth, sliding into second ahead of the throw.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad's ground-rule double down the right-field line drove in two
more runs.</TE>
<TE>   Troy Glaus was walked intentionally--and Anderson made the Royals
pay when he lined a two-run double to right for the fourth and fifth
runs of the inning and a 7-5 lead.</TE>
<TE>   For much of the game, it looked as if it simply wasn't the Angels'
night.</TE>
<TE>   Starting pitcher Scott Schoeneweis got into trouble with two out
in the third when Perez singled, then took third on a steal and an
error by catcher Jorge Fabregas, whose throw was wide of the bag.</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis walked Febles, then made a mistake with an 0-2 pitch
to Carlos Beltran, who lined a single to left to drive in the first
two runs.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Sweeney drove the very next pitch over the wall in left
center, and the Angels were suddenly down, 4-0.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Weber (2-2) relieved Schoeneweis to start the eighth and ended
up earning the victory, needing only five pitches to retire the side.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we're intimidated by anything," Scioscia said.
"We're going to win a lot of games a lot of different ways this
year."</TE>

<HD>A Return to Form Pays Off for Dodgers</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Strong pitching and defense make difference in
1-0 victory over Brewers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>The Brewers donned 1955 replica Milwaukee Brave uniforms for
Wednesday night's game, but it was the Dodgers who turned back the
clock--by a week or so--in a 1-0 victory before 25,954 in Miller
Park.</LD>
<LD>   Offensive juggernauts in their previous four games, when they
scored 25 runs on 43 hits, including nine home runs, the Dodgers
returned to those two old staples of 2002, pitching and defense, to
eke out a victory over baseball's worst team and wash away the sour
taste of Tuesday night's 8-6 loss to Milwaukee, when the Dodgers blew
a five-run lead by giving up eight runs in the seventh inning.</LD>
<LD>   Hideo Nomo threw six shutout innings, snapping a string of three
shaky starts that may have jeopardized his rotation spot, and
relievers Omar Daal, Paul Quantrill and Eric Gagne blanked the
Brewers the final three innings. Gagne struck out two of three in the
ninth for his 15th save, tying him for the major-league lead and
completing the Dodgers' National League-leading sixth shutout.</LD>
<TE>   The league's second-best defensive team also made two run-saving
plays, right fielder Shawn Green throwing out Geoff Jenkins at the
plate in the second inning and left fielder Brian Jordan making a
diving catch of Eric Young's third-inning flare and doubling Alex
Sanchez off second base.</TE>
<TE>   "That was awesome--great pitching and great defense win out every
time," Jordan said. "We had to bounce back today, because a loss like
[Tuesday night's] could have really turned things around for us if we
let it. To win a 1-0 game showed that we didn't let that loss affect
us."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers scored in the third inning when Adrian Beltre swung at
strike three in the dirt but reached on Milwaukee right-hander Ben
Sheets' wild pitch and Green, who homered twice Tuesday night,
grounded a triple into the right-field corner.</TE>
<TE>   Green also came up big in the bottom of the second, after Jenkins
walked and Jose Hernandez doubled him to third. Paul Bako flied to
shallow right, and with the pitcher coming up, Jenkins had little
choice but to tag.</TE>
<TE>   Green, who said he didn't have a good grip on the ball, made a
strong throw on the fly to the plate, but it was a few feet up the
first-base line. Catcher Paul Lo Duca had enough time to retrieve the
ball and make a diving tag of the sliding Jenkins to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodger defense did not rest. Sanchez walked and stole second
with one out in the third, and Young hit a soft liner to shallow
left. Jordan, who is playing with a sore left knee and missed five
games last week because of a strained left abdominal muscle, sprinted
in and made a diving catch, scrambled to his knees and threw to
second in time to double off Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   "My first thought, when the ball went up, was to get to it any way
you can," Jordan said. "Then I saw [Sanchez] running and thought,
'Man, I can make the double play.' Then I thought, 'Don't land on
your [left] knee.' That was the first thing that hit the ground, and
man is it sore. But it was worth it. It saved the game."</TE>
<TE>   Nomo's performance may not have saved his rotation spot--Manager
Jim Tracy said he never considered moving the Japanese right-hander
to the bullpen--but it certainly solidified it.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo walked 14 in his previous three starts, giving up 13 earned
runs in 151/3 innings, and there was speculation that Daal could
replace him in the rotation. But Nomo allowed only four hits in six
innings, struck out seven and walked three during an 88-pitch
performance in which he showed better command of his fastball.</TE>
<TE>   "After the first inning, I told [pitching Coach Jim] Colborn that
his fastball was a lot more lively," said Lo Duca, who threw out
Sanchez trying to steal second base in the eighth inning, the 20th
time in eight games the Brewers had a runner thrown out on the
basepaths. "When you throw a little harder, they have to gear up for
the fastball, and that made his [off-speed] split-fingered pitch even
tougher. He had good stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Not that Tracy doubted him.</TE>
<TE>   "To step up and throw six scoreless innings was a huge boost for
him at a time when it was being insinuated he might move to the
bullpen," Tracy said. "When that was suggested, I said I don't give
up on my players.</TE>
<TE>   "When you know the character of the individuals you're dealing
with, they don't like to be bad for a long period of time; they're
going to do something about it."</TE>

<HD>Ducks Enter Unknown Realm</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Babcock, from minor league Cincinnati, hired as
coach. He has no NHL experience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After introducing relative unknown Mike Babcock as the Mighty Ducks'
sixth coach in 10 seasons Wednesday, General Manager Bryan Murray
made a prediction.</LD>
<LD>   "Three years from now people will be patting me on the back for
making a great selection," Murray said.</LD>
<LD>   To prove Murray correct, Babcock--who arrives with no NHL
experience as a coach or a player--will have to turn around a team
that finished tied for 13th in the Western Conference last season, 25
points out of a playoff spot.</LD>
<TE>   Babcock spent the last two seasons coaching the Ducks' minor
league team in Cincinnati and replaces Murray, who was promoted to
general manager after Pierre Gauthier was fired at the end of last
season.</TE>
<TE>   So the Ducks' fate is in the hands of a coach whose lone NHL
moment was one exhibition game for the Vancouver Canucks in 1985. But
Murray and Babcock downplayed that as a factor in his ability to
coach in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   "When you talk about experience, I have coached for 16 years,"
Babcock said. "I have made a living at it. But you can say all you
want at a press conference. It's not what you say, it's what you do."</TE>
<TE>   Murray pointed out that the Kings' Andy Murray and Colorado's Bob
Hartley were without NHL head coaching experience before being hired.</TE>
<TE>   "When I started looking around at coaches the selection was
obvious to me," Murray said. "I was in the same spot [as a coach] 21
years ago and I'm still sitting around. Mike knows the young players
in the NHL because he has coached against them."</TE>
<TE>   Babcock will meet with assistant coaches Guy Charron and Tom Watt,
who will be considered for his staff. Francois Allaire, the team's
goalie consultant, will remain.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks lost 21 one-goal games last season. But they scored two
or fewer goals in 58 of 82 games.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a strong conference," Babcock said. "Dallas missed the
playoffs and is going to spend a lot of money to get back in. We
can't afford to just keep pace."</TE>
<TE>   What the Ducks are willing to afford is the question.</TE>
<TE>   Murray was to make $675,000 as coach next season, but Babcock
probably will make half that.</TE>
<TE>   Nor are Disney coffers expected to open wide for a top-line free
agent, and Murray said none would consider a team that did not make
the playoffs. Murray said he has a list of other free agents, "at
least a couple of which we would like to bring in."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, who have made the playoffs only twice in nine seasons,
hardly enjoy a "lovable loser" image at the box office. They played
to 99% capacity at the Arrowhead Pond in 1997-98 but averaged an
NHL-low 11,507 tickets sold last season.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Pressler, who oversees the Ducks for Disney, made two moves
that pleased fans, pushing out Tony Tavares, the team's chairman and
governor, and firing Gauthier. But Duck fans, who have seen five
coaches and three general managers in nine seasons, are not likely to
jump to buy tickets with the announcement of Babcock as coach.</TE>
<TE>   Babcock, 39, has spent the last 10 seasons as a head coach in the
minor leagues, with Cincinnati, Spokane and Moose Jaw.</TE>
<TE>   He also coached the Canadian World Junior team to the gold medal
in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Babcock has a 284-250-35 record as a minor league coach.</TE>
<TE>   "I got to know Mike during training camp the last two seasons and
I think he's a terrific person," team captain Paul Kariya said. "He's
an enthusiastic, upbeat coach. A head coach in the NHL has to be able
to motivate his players. I think we needed a fresh face and I think
we're on the right track."</TE>
<TE>   Murray said he considered 19 candidates and narrowed his choices
to three. After meeting with Babcock last week, Murray said he
canceled the other two interviews.</TE>
<TE>   "I got to know Bryan during training camp and we really hit it
off," Babcock said. "When you take a job like this, it has to be the
right fit. You don't get many chances to kick the can, so you have to
do it right."</TE>
<TE>   Said Murray: "I think we're heading in a new direction."</TE>

<DH>Horry's heart is with family in Houston, where stricken
young daughter brings aches and joy</DH>

<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>The parking lot at the Pediatric Therapy Center in southwest Houston
was full, drive-around-the-lot-looking-for-a-space full, like the
mall at Christmastime.</LD>
<LD>   The PTC does a brisk business in all seasons.</LD>
<LD>   The children, even the older ones, hold tight to their mothers'
hands without embarrassment. When they leave the shade of the lot,
many involuntarily lift their faces to the sun, which was warming in
the late morning, headed to nearly 90, with a light breeze.</LD>
<TE>   For all of the pictures of animals on the walls and the cartoons
on the televisions, for all the smiles and encouragement from the
therapists and doctors, this place is hard work for the children who
walk in, or are carried in.</TE>
<TE>   Ashlyn Horry used to sit in the back seat of her mother's car and
refuse to get out. Then she would start to cry, and so would her
mother, and there they'd be, Keva Horry pleading, Ashlyn Horry
refusing, while other mothers in other minivans stopped behind them
and wondered if they were coming or going.</TE>
<TE>   Those were the moments when Keva Horry wondered too.</TE>
<TE>   "This is life," she said without regret. "I'm dealing with it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ashlyn is 8. Her father, Robert, plays power forward for the
Lakers. On Monday night, Robert had 20 rebounds in Sacramento, where
the Lakers lost Game 2 of the Western Conference finals.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday afternoon, Ashlyn was standing frightfully near the top
of a four-rung ladder. A physical therapist held her around the
waist, and while the ladder teetered, she handed her a stuffed ball.
With help, Ashlyn pushed the ball with two hands over the front of a
plastic yellow hoop, and the ball fell through, landed on a blue mat
and rolled across the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "She scores!" the therapist cried. "Yeah!"</TE>
<TE>   Across the room, Keva Horry clapped. Ashlyn threw back her head
and smiled. Her eyes joyously turned to slits and her arms and legs
went stiff. When she opened her eyes, Ashlyn found her mother.</TE>
<TE>   Keva picked up the blue ball and rolled it back, her first rebound
of the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a pride now because I'm seeing things the doctors didn't
expect her to do," Keva said. "That gives me hope."</TE>
<TE>   As the Horrys understand it, Ashlyn, their first child, was born
without part of her first chromosome. They've never asked for the
name of what she has, because it has never seemed important. She
cannot yet speak, walk or eat, and there is no guarantee she ever
will.</TE>
<TE>   "One doctor told me it's a freak of nature," Keva said.</TE>
<TE>   Ashlyn spent her first six months in the hospital, and she has
been back often.</TE>
<TE>   She can cover ground with the help of a four-wheeled walker, a
dicey transport without brakes. She leans forward, the walker rolls
and suddenly she's nearly at a full run down the sidewalk, sending
her parents after her with a mix of amusement and terror.</TE>
<TE>   Ashlyn eats mostly through a tube in her stomach. An IV stand sits
in a corner of her lavender-colored bedroom on the first floor of the
family's home, beside her bed.</TE>
<TE>   For three years she had a tracheotomy, allowing her to breath.
Complications arose, as they often did then, and Ashlyn had her
epiglottis--the flap that covers the windpipe during
swallowing--removed, making eating a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Half of Tuesday's two-hour therapy session at PTC was spent in a
tiny back room, where a kind woman named Judy Boshart dabbed baby
food from a Dixie cup to Ashlyn's lips.</TE>
<TE>   When Ashlyn swallowed or simply tried, she would get as reward a
song or two from a nearby tape recorder, and Miss Judy would call her
"Sugar Bear" or "Boo" and blow soapy bubbles and ask Ashlyn to pop
them. So, Ashlyn sat in a wooden chair, vanilla pudding on her lips,
jerking her head away from a plastic spoon, listening to Barney sing,
"Do You Know the Muffin Man?"</TE>
<TE>   Boshart pulled her face close to Ashlyn's, and rested her own
cheek on the top of the little girl's head as Keva looked on.
"Ashlyn's a people person," she said. "She loves people. They don't
always understand. But she doesn't care."</TE>
<TE>   Boshart understands, and Ashlyn seems to know that. Boshart called
Ashlyn's ailment "a neurological syndrome that mimics cerebral palsy"
in some ways.</TE>
<TE>   The prognosis, she said, "Guarded. Somewhat guarded. It's been so
touch and go with this baby. She was so sick."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The little girl might never become what others are.</TE>
<TE>   That's OK.</TE>
<TE>   Others become what she is, joyfully.</TE>
<TE>   Keva Horry sat in her television room Tuesday afternoon as
workers, with ladders and extension cords over their shoulders,
continued to plod through the two-story Mediterranean-style home in
Houston's posh West Chase neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   There were peacocks in the yard.</TE>
<TE>   "Not ours," Keva said. "They belong to the community."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, they like the Horrys' place best. Robert and Keva had
it built, and have been in it for about a year. The home is stunning,
even set against the other grand and gated homes on the same leafy
street.</TE>
<TE>   On the television, turned to the channel that brings up nine
security cameras in the house, Camron, 3, played with a baby sitter
in segment four. Palm trees waved in the front yard in segment five.
Ashlyn, exhausted from her therapy, slept in segment one. She often
falls asleep on the way home.</TE>
<TE>   The room was quiet and bright. Floor-to-ceiling windows frame a
large backyard, which has a pool, a wooden jungle gym, a basketball
court and a pool house. When Ashlyn and Camron play in the yard, Keva
sometimes will stand in this room, behind those windows, and marvel
at what her little girl has become, the ability she has to change
people.</TE>
<TE>   "She just kind of brings everybody to her level," Keva said.
"Like, 'Hello, this is what it's really all about--happiness.'"</TE>
<TE>   Keva is pretty in a Jasmine Guy, Southern-girl way. She's like
Robert in that she is easy to smile in the light moments and quick to
shrug in the difficult ones. She cries some, such as when Robert
leaves Houston for Los Angeles for his NBA season. She met Robert
when both were attending Alabama. She grew up in Tuscaloosa, Robert
in nearby Andalusia, and they share the same subtle drawls.</TE>
<TE>   Keva had never seen someone so tall and thin, nor met someone as
easygoing. She dated the high-profile athlete--despite her better
judgment, she said--and five years ago they wed, three years after
Ashlyn was born, two years before Camron, a normal child in every
way, was born.</TE>
<TE>   At that moment, Camron walked into the room, held up a new pair of
Nike sneakers and said, "Like Ko-mee Biant!" Kobe Bryant being his
second-favorite Laker. He is his father in miniature, complete with
the big eyes and high, hollow cheeks. He attends a preschool that
feels like Disneyland's Main Street.</TE>
<TE>   Robert isn't around much during basketball season. The Lakers get
to Houston twice a year and the family comes to Los Angeles
occasionally, to a home in Marina del Rey. Moving the family to Los
Angeles isn't an option. It's too vast, Keva said. The Horrys made
their home here when Robert was with the Rockets. And moving would
mean leaving the therapy center where Ashlyn has been going since she
was 2. There are pictures of him all over the house, and he calls
several times a day, Tuesday telling Keva on her cell phone as she
drove home from physical therapy, "I wish I was there with you." She
said, "I wish you were here too."</TE>
<TE>   "This is Robert's favorite room," Keva said, swinging open the
door just off the TV room. "I'm not allowed in here, so don't tell
him I showed you."</TE>
<TE>   She laughed and dragged a hand across a black velvet-lined pool
table. There are half a dozen video games against one wall, a wet bar
in the corner, and a movie theater through a side door. Framed NBA
jerseys are leaning against a wall, waiting to be mounted.</TE>
<TE>   She thinks about him often.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like when you're first starting to date somebody all over
again," she said. "I still get the butterflies. I do. I get nervous,
like, 'Do I look OK?' Really. I still cry when he gets on a plane,
when I drop him off for the season at the airport, I'm boo-hooing all
the way home. It's been going on for so long now. If it stops, I'll
start to worry.</TE>
<TE>   "It gets very lonely. My children are my life. And I miss my
husband. I love him dearly and I am extremely proud of him. I want
him to be happy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The truth is, there are times when Robert Horry feels badly for
Ashlyn.</TE>
<TE>   He admires her courage and loves her determination, but those
things won't allow her to chase her little brother, or catch
fireflies in a jar. When her tiny cousins race each other into the
backyard for one of the swings, Ashlyn sometimes sits nearby,
staring.</TE>
<TE>   "There are bad days, like on the Fourth of July, when we have my
brother's kids and her sister's kids," Robert said after practice
Wednesday in El Segundo. "They're like kids, running around. You can
tell she wants to do what they're doing, but can't. Those are the
days I feel bad for her."</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't last too long, because the doorbell always rings again.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody who knows her, they love Ashlyn like she's their
child," he said. "When people come over, they're like, 'Where's my
baby? Where's Ashlyn?' They get on the floor with her and hug and
kiss on her as much as she can stand."</TE>
<TE>   Keva is not sure about the bad days. "She's happy all the time,"
she said. "She doesn't know any different. That's great, and it's a
peace for me. This is all she knows. She's happy, and I want to keep
it that way."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The sun had passed over the top of the house, and shadows had
fallen on the living room couch, where Keva read a children's book to
Ashlyn and Camron. Though he had been forbidden to eat a cookie so
near suppertime, Camron returned from the kitchen with crumbs stuck
to his mouth, which Keva instantly noticed.</TE>
<TE>   Ashlyn was blissful beside her mother, listening to her voice and
staring sweetly at the pages. She tried to hug her brother, who
pushed her away.</TE>
<TE>   Unbowed, Ashlyn pulled him closer. He groaned and Keva laughed and
kissed Ashlyn.</TE>
<TE>   It is life. And they are dealing with it.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what the reason is just yet," Keva said. "I do on a
daily basis try to figure it out. It's not a 'Why me?' thing anymore.
It used to be. It was very hurtful for the first year. I know her
little life has a purpose. She has a destiny like everybody else.
Maybe she's here for me. Maybe it's for Robert. Maybe that's it.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing is, I never felt like the weight of the world was on
me. You just do it. Before I knew it, we were here."</TE>
<TE>   It's not a bad place. Ashlyn brings them little hardships and she
brings them huge joy. Maybe she doesn't know it, but they're sure she
does. They choose to believe she does.</TE>
<TE>   "She kind of does that on a daily basis," Keva said. "Milestones.
The little accomplishments that, for her, are huge. It happens every
day."</TE>

<HD>Bryant Still Not Ready</HD>
<DH>Lakers: He has to leave practice early. Virus or bacterial
infection not ruled out.</DH>

<LD>Whatever made Kobe Bryant ill before Monday's Game 2 was still in his
system Wednesday as the Laker All-Star was forced to leave practice
early to see one of the team doctors.</LD>
<LD>   John Moe, the team internist, gave Bryant a battery of blood tests
looking for a virus or bacterial infection, and according to team
spokesman John Black, the results were "in the range of normal."</LD>
<LD>   Bryant, who will be on antibiotics for about the next 10 days, is
listed as day-to-day.</LD>
<TE>   "He got sick two or three times during the course of the day,"
Laker Coach Phil Jackson said of Bryant, who did not miss a game
because of illness or injury during the regular season. "He got sick
during our video session and actually had to sit on the floor a
couple of times."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, who slept most of Tuesday when the Lakers were given a day
off, tried to practice but didn't last long.</TE>
<TE>   He was seen leaving the team's El Segundo HealthSouth practice
facility nearly an hour before the Lakers completed practice.</TE>
<TE>   "Knowing Kobe, he just probably thought he could just jump right
back in," Jackson said. "Maybe he jumped in too fast with food or
something and his system wasn't quite ready for that. But I don't
think [it's a serious problem]."</TE>
<TE>   Laker officials still believe that Bryant's illness is a result of
food poisoning, but they are not ruling out a possible bacterial
infection. The Lakers have to look only at Charlotte swingman Jamal
Mashburn, who had a similar illness at the start of the playoffs,
then sat out the Hornets' entire second-round series against New
Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Not having Bryant participate in practice was somewhat of a shock
for his teammates and Jackson, who said he had appeared to be in good
shape on the team's flight home after Monday's loss at Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "His spirits were good and he seemed like he had a lot of energy,"
guard Brian Shaw said about Bryant. "He was laughing and joking,
playing around with everyone. He was acting like his normal self."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's high energy level on the flight may have been the result
of three liters of intravenous fluid he received before Monday's
game.</TE>
<TE>   "He showed up to practice, but you can see that he was still
battling the effects of being sick from the other day," forward Rick
Fox said. "It may take him a couple of days to recover, which makes
it perfect for us to have three days off [before Friday's Game 3 at
Staples Center].</TE>
<TE>   "I think he tried to eat this morning, which is a good indication
because he felt good enough to do so. But he didn't respond very well
to the food. I am not a doctor, but it may have been too early for
him."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, who scored 30 points in Game 1, played 40 minutes Monday
and finished with 22 points.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked pretty good to me," Sacramento Coach Rick Adelman said
after watching tape of Bryant's Game 2 effort. "I'm sure it was some
type of factor for him to have played 40 minutes instead of 45."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant did look strong at times Monday but, for the most part, he
wasn't the same player who had dominated Game 1. Bryant missed 12 of
21 field-goal attempts and seemed to be a step slow on defense as he
struggled to keep up with the Kings' Bobby Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's illness in Sacramento was blamed on a bacon cheeseburger
and slice of cheesecake he ordered late Sunday night from room
service. Black said he didn't know what Bryant ate Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Although it's questionable whether Bryant will be able to practice
today, his teammates are confident that he'll be ready for Friday's
game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be concerned if we had to play tonight, or even tomorrow,"
Fox said. "I know he'll be fine by Friday."</TE>
<TE>   Added Jackson: "I don't think there's anything that can deter him
from playing."</TE>

<HD>Glee Cub</HD>
<DH>Prior strikes out 10 in six innings and picks up the
victory in debut for Chicago</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>This was deliverance, pure and simple, a 21-year-old purported savior
of a city coming through with the goods, fulfilling unreal
expectations and providing blessed release for beleaguered fans.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Prior, less than a year removed from USC's Dedeaux Field, won
his Chicago Cub debut Wednesday night, striking out 10 Pittsburgh
Pirates and giving up two runs in six innings of a 7-4 victory.</LD>
<LD>   Rarely in an already disappointing season--heck, it has been a
disappointing nine decades--has anything associated with the Cubs
resulted in less than total disaster. Then along comes Prior, an
implacable former Trojan business major with precisely trimmed
sideburns and impeccable control.</LD>
<TE>   "I felt as normal as could be, the same as I always do," he said.
"When I came out of the game and sat in the dugout and looked around
at the fans, it was kind of surreal. It was an experience I won't
forget."</TE>
<TE>   The near-sellout Wrigley Field crowd anticipated this Prior
engagement for weeks as the right-hander mowed down minor league
hitters and moved ever closer to a Cub call-up.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Don Baylor coveted Prior since spring training. And after
a fitful 15-28 start, the Cubs needed him--for morale, for
excitement, for a victory.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of pressure with all the fanfare," Baylor said.
"It would be tough for anybody, especially a young kid. It was a
great game to be a part of. There was a lot of enthusiasm on the
bench. We went after it."</TE>
<TE>   Prior's first pitch is a called strike on the outside corner to
center fielder Chad Hermansen. On a 2-2 count, Hermansen drills a
fastball up the middle for a single. Jack Wilson bunts Hermansen to
second, but Brian Giles and Aramis Ramirez strike out looking.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs give Prior a cushion in the bottom of the inning on Fred
McGriff's two-run double.</TE>
<TE>   Headlines shouted across the Windy City for days, heralding
Prior's arrival: "Priormania," "The Can't-Miss Kid," "Great
Expectations." Prior's teammates taped to his locker a tabloid page
that displayed a large photo of him below smaller shots of three
pitchers whose exploits he presumably is expected to eclipse: Roger
Clemens, Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime Cub followers can't recall hype of this magnitude. Not in
1998 with Kerry Wood, who made his debut at 20, and not in 1971, with
Burt Hooton, who came to the Cubs straight out of college.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Prior seemed oblivious to the 150 media
members--three times the normal number--crowding the clubhouse before
the game. He sat at his locker, his nose buried in the Chicago
Tribune, reading not about himself, but about his former hometown.</TE>
<TE>   This headline read: "L.A.'s Marriage to Valley Nears Rocks," and
the story detailed the San Fernando Valley's attempt to secede from
Los Angeles. Was he nostalgic about USC as his debut approached?</TE>
<TE>   "No, it was just an interesting story," he said. "I didn't know
the Valley was separating. I was staying in the moment and reading
the paper."</TE>
<TE>   The only distraction came from Sammy Sosa, who danced past Prior's
locker to a salsa tune blasting from his boom box and said, "Hey,
relax, man."</TE>
<TE>   Prior shot back a wry smile as if to say, "What, me worry?"</TE>
<TE>   Prior appears nervous in the second inning, walking Rob Mackowiak
and hitting Jason Kendall with an 0-2 pitch. Kevin Young bounces a
changeup into a 5-4-3 double play, but Pokey Reese singles to drive
in Mackowiak. Prior gets pitcher Dave Williams for his third
strikeout.</TE>
<TE>   Prior hit three home runs in 19 minor league at-bats and knocked a
pregame batting-practice pitch onto Waveland Ave., but he takes a
full-count fastball for strike three in his first at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   Wood watched as reporters swarmed Prior after the game. He thought
back to his own debut four years ago. If only he'd known then what he
knows now.</TE>
<TE>   "This is 10 times worse than when I came up," he said. "I feel
sorry for him more than anything else. But he has a good head on his
shoulders."</TE>
<TE>   Wood poured champagne on Prior's head, a time-honored ritual of
rookie acceptance. He is excited that he and Prior will be in the
same starting rotation for years.</TE>
<TE>   "We aren't going to win 25 in a row because he showed up," Wood
said. "But he's going to make us more competitive on a daily basis.
He looks at it that way too.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the hype is over and he's doing his job."</TE>
<TE>   Prior strikes out the side in the third. Sosa homers in the bottom
of the inning to extend the Cub lead to 3-1 and Prior continues to
sail in the fourth, retiring the side in order for the first time and
getting his seventh strikeout.</TE>
<TE>   Prior is a starter being counted on for saves. As in saving the
jobs of Baylor and General Manager Andy McPhail.</TE>
<TE>   The forever star-crossed Cubs have been more inept than usual.
Eight players are batting below .200, creaky veterans McGriff and
Moises Alou are not producing and second baseman Delino DeShields
lost his job two weeks ago to rookie Bobby Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Prior provides a ray of hope, a reason to come to the park for
fans who haven't seen their team in a World Series since 1945.</TE>
<TE>   Lifelong Cub fans Clint Douglas and Ben Johnson, both 21, drove
two hours from Princeton, Ill., to catch Prior's debut. Wearing
unbuttoned Cub jerseys and Cub caps on backward, they look forward to
rooting for a dominant hometown pitcher their own age.</TE>
<TE>   "It's lively here tonight," Douglas said. "That's why we're here,
to watch Prior and say we saw his first game."</TE>
<TE>   Added Johnson: "This is history in the making."</TE>
<TE>   The fourth inning ends with Cub center fielder Corey Patterson
chasing down a fly ball at the warning track and the fifth begins
with Patterson making a running catch over his shoulder. Prior
strikes out Williams, walks Hermansen and gets Wilson on a fly to
right.</TE>
<TE>   If Yankee Stadium is the house that Ruth built, Prior is the
pitcher that House built.</TE>
<TE>   Tom House once was best known as the Atlanta Brave reliever who
caught Hank Aaron's 715th home run, the one that pushed him past Babe
Ruth. Now he is a San Diego-based PhD and pitching guru credited with
taming the control problems of Hall of Famer Ryan and Arizona
Diamondback ace Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Prior is his latest pet project. They met seven years ago after a
14-year-old Prior was shelled in a youth league game against House's
son's team.</TE>
<TE>   "Mark has been exposed to, and taken advantage of, the best
research available," House said. "He has been the poster child for
what is, objectively, nontraditional baseball knowledge. He's not
going to fail."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his sizable investment of time and effort in Prior, House
professes impartiality, pointing to science.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not my opinion," he said. "With motion analysis, blood
chemistry, mental-emotional makeup, he matches up statistically.
Nolan Ryan had some of the pieces. Other guys have had some. Mark is
the first to have them all. Objectively, he's a can't-miss."</TE>
<TE>   Prior is a house on fire after Brian Giles leads off the sixth
with a home run, striking out Ramirez and Mackowiak to complete his
10-K run and getting Kendall to ground out. Sensing it is the
rookie's last inning, the crowd stands and cheers as he walks to the
dugout.</TE>
<TE>   By rights, Prior should be preparing to graduate from college.
Instead, he signed a five-year, $10.5-million contract with the Cubs
last summer and needed only nine minor league starts to reach the big
leagues.</TE>
<TE>   Debut in the books, the real learning begins.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm already thinking about my next start," he said moments after
the game. "I was missing high with my fastball because of the
adrenaline and had trouble spotting pitches where I wanted to. I've
got a lot of work to do.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I'll realize the magnitude of this game until the
season is over. But it's a big help to know I earned the respect of
my teammates."</TE>
<TE>   Not to mention the respect of long-suffering Cub fans, who will
hold the hope Prior brings with the tenacity of the ivy clinging to
Wrigley's outfield walls.</TE>

<HD>Drug Suspect Can't Be Extradited</HD>
<DH>Crime: A Mexican court denies a U.S. request, saying a
guarantee that the alleged 'meth king' would not face a life term is
insufficient.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>In a blow to U.S. efforts to extradite suspected drug kingpins, a
Mexican court has denied prosecutors' request to transport Jesus
Amezcua to a San Diego federal district court where he faces drug
trafficking charges.</LD>
<LD>   The case has been closely watched by law enforcement officials on
both sides of the border since Amezcua's arrest in Mexico City in
June 1998 as he consulted with a Cuban Santeria guru. U.S. justice
officials have labeled Amezcua and his two brothers "the meth kings
of this hemisphere."</LD>
<LD>   A Mexican federal tribunal ruled that a U.S. guarantee given to
the Mexican government that Amezcua would not face a possible life
term if found guilty was insufficient, according to a Mexican law
enforcement official who asked not to be identified.</LD>
<TE>   Although the judge's decision does not necessarily set a
precedent, it might impede pending or anticipated requests for
extraditions of other alleged drug traffickers wanted in the United
States, including Benjamin Arellano Felix and Ismael "El Mayel"
Higuera Guerrero, both reportedly of the Tijuana drug cartel.</TE>
<TE>   Although the U.S. has an extradition treaty with Mexico, Mexican
citizens cannot be extradited if they face the death penalty or life
in prison, according to a Mexican Supreme Court ruling in October.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. prosecutors have tried to circumvent the ban by seeking
consecutive prison terms that can add up to life in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Amezcua's attorney, Americo Delgado, was quoted in the Reforma
newspaper here as saying the Mexican court would not accept a
"diplomatic note" provided by the U.S. State Department guaranteeing
that his client would not receive life in jail if found guilty.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is that no guarantee given by the executive branch [of
the U.S. government, including prosecutors] will necessarily be
honored or observed by the judiciary branch," said a Mexican
government official who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Justice Department declined to comment
on the decision, saying the government had not been officially
notified of the denial.</TE>
<TE>   Amezcua, 36, has been jailed since his arrest on charges that he
ran an extensive methamphetamine manufacturing and distribution ring
that had "global dimensions," according to former U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration chief Thomas A. Constantine in testimony
before Congress in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Amezcua and two brothers, Luis and Adan, allegedly began by
selling 1-pound packages of the drug in Southern California, but over
time they reportedly created a manufacturing and smuggling ring with
operations in Europe as well as the western and southern United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Jesus Amezcua was acquitted of Mexican charges shortly after his
arrest but remained in jail pending the U.S. extradition request,
which was approved by the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Relations.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors seeking Mexican suspects have met with limited
success because of the legal barriers.</TE>
<TE>   Mexicans must first face Mexican charges and serve sentences
before they can be extradited to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. law enforcement's biggest victory to date was the extradition
last May of Everardo Arturo "Kitty" Paez, a high-level operative of
the Tijuana cartel, to San Diego. He later plea-bargained a 30-year
prison sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, U.S. officials also extradited Miguel Angel Martinez
Martinez, an alleged lieutenant of the Joaquin "Chapo" Guzman
organization. Martinez is awaiting trial in a San Diego jail.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. officials say the Mexican ruling denying extradition in
death penalty or life imprisonment cases has given extradition
targets and their attorneys a new weapon to fight the process.</TE>
<TE>   Rafael Aguirre in The Times' Mexico City Bureau contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>O'Neill, Bono Differ on Needs of Poor</HD>
<DH>Ghana: Treasury secretary touts free enterprise, while
singer wants more foreign aid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>ACCRA, Ghana</DL>
<LD>Three days into their tour of Africa, U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul H.
O'Neill and rock singer Bono staked out opposing positions Wednesday
on whether private enterprise or more aid was best to help the
world's most impoverished continent.</LD>
<LD>   As O'Neill's entourage, shepherded by Secret Service agents,
pushed its way through the smiling throng in the teeming Makola
market here in Ghana's capital, the Treasury chief said he saw all
the signs of a potential business class.</LD>
<LD>   Noting the displays of colorful cloth and textiles piled high in
rickety stalls, O'Neill said they were "Made in Ghana" products that
could sell anywhere.</LD>
<TE>   "You could make micro-loans to people like these, and they could
be on their way," said O'Neill, an ardent advocate of private
enterprise to reduce poverty and create jobs.</TE>
<TE>   But Bono, frontman of the rock group U2 who has taken to heart the
issue of debt relief for impoverished countries and increased aid,
said it was impossible to talk about fostering business without
decent roads, electricity and basic services.</TE>
<TE>   Bono also warned that popular support for the U.S. could quickly
turn into anger if Washington--which fears that dispossessed Africans
could be easy recruits for terrorist groups--did nothing to alleviate
the continent's poverty.</TE>
<TE>   "We are driving down the streets and people are waving, people are
jumping up and down, they are glad to see the United States," Bono
said. "If this country doesn't get help ... you come back in five
years and they'll be throwing rocks at the bus."</TE>
<TE>   In a U.N. ranking of human development, Ghana, a former British
colony, sits at 119 out of 162 countries.</TE>

<LD>   The death toll from a weeklong heat wave that gripped southeastern
India rose to 1,030 as reports trickled in from remote villages. Most
of the dead were older people unable to bear temperatures that
reached 122 degrees.</LD>
<LD>   The death toll "is much worse than we had anticipated," relief
commissioner D.C. Roshaiah said. The intense heat turned tin-roofed
shanties into ovens. Ponds and rivers dried up, birds fell from the
sky, and animals collapsed. The deaths occurred May 9 to May 15. The
weekly toll is the highest for any recorded Indian heat wave.</LD>

<HD>Bush, in Berlin, Urges Unity in Terror War</HD>
<DH>Germany: In a city that welcomed Kennedy, leaders support
president's views, but protesters demonstrate against U.S. policies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG and CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BERLIN--President Bush began a weeklong trip to Europe on Wednesday
with a blunt reminder to the allies he will visit that they too are
potential targets of terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   His message was aimed at a Europe where, allegiances among
officials not withstanding, there is a growing popular wariness about
his leadership of the West.</LD>
<LD>   But even as European populations show anxiety that the Bush
administration is leading their nations into a wider war on
terrorism, their governments have rarely been more closely aligned
with American policy.</LD>
<TE>   "Our alliance must remain tough in the war against global terror,"
the president said as he left the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Singling out each country he will visit, he added: "Even though
we've had some initial successes, there's still danger for countries
which embrace freedom, countries such as ours or Germany, France,
Russia or Italy."</TE>
<TE>   Bush arrived at Tegel International Airport at dusk, strode a red
carpet, reviewed a small military honor guard and was driven to the
center of Germany's capital for apple strudel, ice cream and coffee
with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder at a cafe adjacent to the
Brandenburg Gate. They planned a formal meeting today.</TE>
<TE>   Cooperation</TE>
<TE>   and Differences</TE>
<TE>   The president's remarks set the tone for his eighth foreign trip
as president and his first to Germany: Among officials on both sides
of the Atlantic, there is a new level of cooperation on such pressing
issues as arms control and the war in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   But just below the surface, differences percolate over what are
seen as protectionist U.S. trade sanctions, nuclear proliferation--in
particular Washington's concerns that Russia is not maintaining a
tight grip on its nuclear technology--and the Bush administration's
rejection of international treaties, among them the Kyoto Protocol
against global warming.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Bush administration officials are privately pressing
Germany to do more to block terrorist financial assets, after it
failed, in the U.S. view, to uncover the extent of the Islamic
terrorist network that was well established in the country before the
Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   During the Cold War, Berlin welcomed U.S. presidents with open
arms, most notably John F. Kennedy, who made his impassioned 1963
pledge of "Ich bin ein Berliner." On Wednesday, Bush encountered a
cold shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands hit the streets of the German capital to protest his
menacing hints of an imminent attack on Iraq, as well as his trade
and environmental policies.</TE>
<TE>   Two hours before the president arrived, antiwar demonstrators and
globalization critics staged a nationwide beating of Bush-Trommeln, a
play on the German for jungle drums. That protest and an earlier
march through central Berlin by a new alliance that calls itself the
"Axis of Peace" were orderly, but a number of pro-Palestinian
demonstrators clashed with police. Windows at a McDonald's restaurant
and a department store were smashed, and some arrests and injuries
were reported.</TE>
<TE>   Before arriving in Germany, Bush said he expected to encounter
some disenchantment. "That's democracy," Bush said Tuesday in an
interview with the German television network ARD. "I know there's
some reluctance about some of the positions I take."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday evening, nearly 20,000 protesters marched along Unter
den Linden to Alexanderplatz in one of the biggest anti-American
demonstrations in Berlin in recent decades. A smaller crowd turned
out Wednesday. But both posed a jarring contrast to the sympathy
expressed for Americans during a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate by
200,000 Germans after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "The political elites" are in close communication, German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer said in an interview with a small group of
reporters Wednesday afternoon. "The big problem will be the broader
public opinion."</TE>
<TE>   Fischer, the senior member of the pacifist Greens party in
Schroeder's coalition government, said he was "in constant debate
with the demonstrators," seeking to convince them that negotiations
with Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network would be fruitless.</TE>
<TE>   But, reflecting the divisions within German politics, he said the
successors to the Communist Party "think they can catch a lot of
votes for the left" by opposing cooperation with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Objections to</TE>
<TE>   Expanding the War</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder has pledged Germany's "unreserved solidarity" in the
fight against terror. But objections to spreading the anti-terror
battle to Iraq are even more vehement than the dissatisfaction with
the campaign against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, and extend to the
highest political levels.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as it is unproven that Saddam [Hussein] belongs to the
group that provides shelter or support for terrorists such as Al
Qaeda, there is no reason to take action against Iraq," Peter Struck,
the parliamentary leader of Schroeder's Social Democratic Party, told
ARD television on the eve of Bush's visit.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be completely wrong if the American president would now
attempt to do what his father failed to do," Struck said, implying an
attempt to settle former President George Bush's score with the Iraqi
leader, who survived the 1991 Persian Gulf War in power.</TE>
<TE>   Antje Vollmer, Struck's counterpart in the Greens party,
criticized Bush's "almost missionary approach against evil," which,
she told Stern magazine, risked inflaming religious passions
throughout the Islamic world.</TE>
<TE>   A senior German government official who briefed reporters on
condition he not be identified said Schroeder would press Bush for a
candid assessment of the war on terrorism's next missions and would
urge him to consider "actions other than military" to persuade
hostile governments to renounce terror.</TE>
<TE>   This week's edition of Der Spiegel magazine published a poll
showing respondents more critical of U.S. policy than are citizens of
the other countries Bush will visit on his European tour. Of those
queried, 19% gave Bush a positive rating, compared with 50% who said
they had negative attitudes toward the president.</TE>
<TE>   Though the demonstrators and other critics of Washington were
drawing the most attention, some prominent German media insisted that
the vast majority in this country remained steadfast U.S. allies.</TE>
<TE>   "We are with you in the sober realization that it is our duty to
combat tyranny and terrorism with courage and clarity of purpose,
even though this is no easy task," the Sueddeutsche Zeitung asserted
in an editorial, recalling the 1948-49 Berlin airlift and the strong
Cold War presence that saved this city from encroachment by the
Communist empire.</TE>
<TE>   "The free city of Berlin knows full well what it owes America,"
the newspaper continued. "In Berlin, America drew a clear line
between the free world and Communist tyranny. The American ideal of
liberty is engraved in our hearts."</TE>
<TE>   More than 10,000 police were deployed to seal off a 14-block area
of the capital around the sites of Bush's 19-hour visit.</TE>
<TE>   Employees of the new office buildings around the Chancellery and
Reichstag buildings were told to leave their cars at home for the
duration of the visit and rely on public transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Divers plunged into the Spree River in search of explosives, and
pedestrians were prohibited from approaching the Adlon Hotel, where
the president was staying. The hotel overlooks the Brandenburg Gate,
which is undergoing renovation. The gate is covered with a
scaffolding shroud that depicts the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Josh Meyer in Washington contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Embassy Blaze in Paris Investigated</HD>
<DH>Europe: Officials say there is no sign of wrongdoing. Five
firefighters are hurt.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>A fire erupted early today at the Israeli Embassy in Paris, slightly
injuring five firefighters and causing heavy damage to the building,
officials said. But there were no indications that the blaze was
caused by arson or an attack.</LD>
<LD>   The fire started about 2:20 a.m. Authorities initially said the
blaze had destroyed an unoccupied wing of the embassy that was being
renovated. But Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe later said, "It is in
fact the embassy" that was burned.</LD>
<LD>   Fire Capt. Laurent Vibert described the building as "badly
damaged" on four levels. He said it took about two hours to
extinguish the fire.</LD>
<TE>   About 60 people in an adjacent building were evacuated as 150
firefighters battled the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of firefighters and fire vehicles were at the scene, as
were Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin and Interior Minister
Nicolas Sarkozy.</TE>
<TE>   French President Jacques Chirac telephoned Israeli Ambassador Elie
Barnavi and told him that an investigation would be carried out to
determine the cause of the fire, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Vibert said smoke billowed out of the building shortly after the
blaze erupted, a possible indication that the fire was electrical in
origin. Investigators were at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   "No indication leads us to believe it was an attack," Vibert said.
Barnavi said the fire was probably an accident.</TE>
<TE>   Synagogues and other Jewish institutions have been targeted in
France for more than a year, as Middle East violence has escalated.</TE>

<HD>India Prepares for 'Decisive Battle'</HD>
<DH>Kashmir: Prime minister tells soldiers to be ready for
sacrifice in a message aimed at Pakistan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>KUPWARA, India</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee warned soldiers in this border
village Wednesday to gird themselves for a "decisive battle" against
Islamic militants who have been waging a separatist war in
Indian-controlled Kashmir.</LD>
<LD>   Striking a bellicose tone, Vajpayee said his visit to an army camp
fewer than 12 miles from the Line of Control that divides Kashmir was
intended to send a strong message to Pakistan, which India has
accused of sponsoring the insurgents.</LD>
<LD>   "My coming here is a signal," he said in a speech to about 700
soldiers that was carried live on national television. "Whether or
not our neighbor understands this signal, whether the world takes
account of it or not, history will be witness to this. We shall write
a new chapter of victory."</LD>
<TE>   Vajpayee told the troops to "be ready for sacrifice" because "the
time has come for decisive battle."</TE>
<TE>   India and Pakistan have assembled an estimated 1 million soldiers,
heavy artillery and short-range ballistic missile batteries along
their border. The buildup began in December after militants, who
India contends were from Pakistan, attacked the Parliament in New
Delhi, resulting in 14 deaths, including the five assailants.</TE>
<TE>   India's navy said Wednesday that it was moving five warships from
the eastern fleet to reinforce its western fleet in the Arabian Sea
south of Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "The warships have been moved to increase the level of
preparedness on the western sector, keeping in view the nation's
security concerns and the operational situation," an Indian navy
spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   The navy has 140 ships. The spokesman said the five ships--a
destroyer, a frigate and three missile corvettes--would reach the
Arabian Sea within a week.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting in Kashmir has flared in recent weeks, and on Wednesday,
Pakistan reported that a 10-year-old girl was killed and three other
people were wounded as the two sides traded fire.</TE>

<HD>Suicide Attack Kills 2 Israelis</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The second such blast this month in Rishon Le Zion
injures 36. The Palestinian bomber bleached his hair as a disguise.</DH>

<DL>RISHON LE ZION, Israel</DL>
<LD>A Palestinian suicide bomber who bleached his hair as a disguise
waded Wednesday into a city park where elderly Russian immigrants
gathered nightly to play chess and cards. Standing amid crowded
benches and tables, he blew himself up, killing two Israelis and
wounding dozens more.</LD>
<LD>   The explosion along Rishon Le Zion's downtown pedestrian mall was
the second suicide bombing in this city near Tel Aviv in two weeks.
The earlier attack killed 15 Israelis at a pool hall.</LD>
<LD>   The government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, immersed in a
coalition crisis, blamed Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for the
attack and vowed to take "whatever measures necessary."</LD>
<TE>   The Palestinian Authority condemned the bombing. Arafat, under
international pressure to rein in militants, has called on
Palestinians to refrain from suicide bombings and the shooting of
civilians inside Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Wednesday, Israeli forces killed a top Palestinian militia
commander by firing missiles into the Balata refugee camp, near
Nablus in the West Bank. Three other men also were killed.</TE>
<TE>   How Israel will respond to Wednesday's suicide bombing, the second
in four days, remained an open question early today. In the past
Israel has retaliated with massive military incursions into
Palestinian territory, and the army has been poised to invade the
Gaza Strip for several weeks. Before daybreak, residents of Hebron
reported that Israeli forces had entered the West Bank city.</TE>
<TE>   Mounting a major offensive might not be necessary now, however;
Israeli forces surround all major Palestinian cities and most towns,
and enter regularly and at will on raids to kill or arrest suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Rishon Le Zion, a suburb south of Tel Aviv, at least 36
people were hurt in Wednesday night's blast, said police and
officials at three hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   The two Israelis killed were identified by television as a boy,
age 14 or 15, and a 66-year-old man.</TE>
<TE>   There were unconfirmed reports that the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a
militia affiliated with Arafat's Fatah movement, had claimed
responsibility for the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes before the 9 p.m. blast, Rishon Le Zion resident Ariel
Maimon, 34, was standing about 20 feet from the small, canopied park.
He heard the explosion and ran toward a huge flash.</TE>
<TE>   "There were people lying all over the ground," he said. "I saw one
man in a black suit with his arm blown off. There was nothing I could
do. I was in total shock."</TE>
<TE>   A woman in her 20s approached the man in the black suit, removed
her shoelaces and desperately attempted to staunch the blood from
what was left of his arm.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to help people--people were crying," said construction
worker Matslich Salawy, 42, his white T-shirt sprayed with blood. "I
helped a boy about 14 who was wounded in the leg. Then he died in my
arms."</TE>
<TE>   Police spokesman Supt. Gil Kleiman said the bomber had bleached
and spiked his hair, apparently to "look more European" and blend in.
The blast turned the informal, friendly scene to one of chaos,
blood-soaked pavement, twisted bodies and the flashing red lights of
dozens of ambulance, police and rescue vehicles. On the back side of
the garden, bits of human flesh were splattered on a chain-link fence
and the facade of a building, where windows as high as the third
story were shattered.</TE>
<TE>   Mazi Lavi, a 48-year-old mother of five, rushed to the scene from
the mall restaurant where she was eating. One of her relatives was
killed in the suicide bombing two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I am so afraid of terrorists.... I can't even feel confident
about leaving my house," she said. "I can't believe in anything
anymore. I'm very scared. We can't live like this. What can be our
destiny in this country? Everything has changed."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli forces, meanwhile, killed five Palestinians on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The best known was Mahmoud Titi, an Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade
commander in the Balata camp, where the militia essentially was
founded. He had eluded Israeli capture for months. Israel accused him
of leading attacks on Israelis and described him in a statement as a
"senior terrorist."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians said Titi, two associates and a bystander were killed
when Israeli tanks fired shells on the men, who were gathered in the
cemetery in Balata.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, Israeli border police shot and killed Moussa
Daraghmeh, 35, at the main checkpoint outside Bethlehem after he
allegedly refused to raise his hands during a search.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Tracy Wilkinson in Jerusalem contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>A Frail Pope Takes Message of Tolerance to Azerbaijan</HD>
<DH>Visit: The pontiff, who is lowered off his plane, seeks to
improve Vatican ties with Muslims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BAKU, Azerbaijan--Spreading a message of religious tolerance, Pope
John Paul II arrived here Wednesday on the 96th foreign trip of his
papacy. But in a sign of increased frailty, he failed for the first
time on such a journey to walk off his aircraft and instead was
lowered to the runway by a special lift.</LD>
<LD>   John Paul, 82, greeted assembled dignitaries and spoke for a few
minutes in Russian, widely understood in this predominantly Muslim
former Soviet republic. He then had an aide give the rest of his
speech.</LD>
<LD>   "Here at the gateway to the East, not far from where armed
conflict continues cruelly and senselessly to prevail, I wish to
raise my voice," the Polish pontiff declared in the address. "I ask
religious leaders to reject all violence as offensive to the name of
God and to be tireless promoters of peace and harmony."</LD>
<TE>   The pontiff's five-day tour, which includes Bulgaria, is part of a
drive to improve the Vatican's relations with the Muslim and Orthodox
Christian worlds. Last year, during his visit to Syria, he became the
first pope to visit and pray in a Muslim house of worship. Burying
centuries of feuding between the Roman Catholic and Orthodox faiths
is one of his goals.</TE>
<TE>   Recent weeks have seen growing speculation among cardinals that
John Paul, who suffers from arthritis and symptoms of Parkinson's
disease, might resign if his health deteriorates to the point where
he can no longer govern the church. But the pope--in his 24th year as
pontiff--has indicated that he has no plans to step down and that he
hopes to continue to travel.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as I have breath within me, I shall cry out: 'Peace, in
the name of God,'" he told Azerbaijani lawmakers at President Heydar
A. Aliyev's ornate office. He gave part of his speech in heavily
slurred, barely audible Russian, then again had an aide take over.</TE>
<TE>   At the airport and in the corridors of the presidential palace,
the pope walked no more than a few steps. Instead he was wheeled
around standing on mobile platforms with hand rails.</TE>
<TE>   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls told reporters that
although the pope clearly faces physical constraints, "the question
is whether these physical limitations impede him from carrying out
his duties and traveling, and he is showing that they are not an
impediment."</TE>
<TE>   In Baku, the capital, John Paul visited a monument to those killed
in a pro-independence uprising that was crushed by Soviet tanks in
1990 and in fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh in the early 1990s. That
enclave was part of Azerbaijan in the Soviet era but had a primarily
Armenian population and is now controlled by Armenia, another former
Soviet republic. A cease-fire has been in effect since 1994, but the
threat of resumed fighting exists.</TE>
<TE>   Aliyev, the Azerbaijani president, referred to the conflict in his
airport welcoming speech.</TE>
<TE>   "You propagate compassion and mercy, you pray for tolerance and
consolation of those who encountered tragedy," he told the pope.
"There are victims of tragic events in Azerbaijan too. These are more
than 1 million Azerbaijani refugees who lost their homes.... These
people are in need of your kind words.... They hope for the triumph
of justice, and they seek help from you."</TE>
<TE>   John Paul also addressed the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "My thoughts go also to the emigrants and refugees in this
country," he said. "With the help of international solidarity, may
their hopes be restored for a future of prosperity and peace in their
own lands for themselves and for their dear ones."</TE>
<TE>   Peace everywhere must be based "on mutual respect, on the
rejection of fundamentalism and every form of imperialism, on the
pursuit of dialogue as the only effective means of resolving
tensions, so that entire nations are saved from the cruelty of
violence," the pope said.</TE>
<TE>   Vatican officials have indicated that one purpose of John Paul's
journey here is to counterbalance a visit he made last year to
predominantly Christian Armenia. Many citizens here are hoping that
the pope's visit will draw attention to the plight of refugees from
Nagorno-Karabakh and shift international opinion toward greater
support for Azerbaijan's claim to the territory.</TE>
<TE>   Expectations are so high that there could be a public backlash if
John Paul's words today--when he is scheduled to meet refugees after
conducting Mass at a sports hall--are deemed insufficient.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Christian tradition, if religious figures know the truth
and they hide it, it's a great sin," said Seherbey Kerbelaye, 76, a
pensioner interviewed in Baku's old town district. "If he's really a
religious figure he must tell the truth.'' Azerbaijan has only about
100 Roman Catholics among its 7.7 million people, according to
government statistics, with other Christian denominations making up
less than 7% of the population. Without a Vatican mission or large
church community to serve as host, the pope is staying in a hotel for
the first time in his trips.</TE>

<HD>Sharon Plots His Next Move to Preserve Tenuous Coalition</HD>
<DH>Israel: Having ousted two ultra-Orthodox parties, he woos
new potential partners, and his economic package wins tentative
approval.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon made good today on his threat to
drive two ultra-Orthodox parties from his coalition, betting that his
rising popularity will keep him in power with a razor-thin
parliamentary majority.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon let his dismissal of Cabinet ministers and deputy ministers
from the Shas and United Torah Judaism parties take effect at 12:30
a.m. today, hours after parliament gave preliminary approval to his
economic austerity plan, which those parties had helped defeat
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon had warned the parties that unless they voted in favor of
the package in Wednesday's vote, he would fire them for
insubordination. Instead, 17 legislators of the Shas Party staged a
walkout from the Knesset, or parliament, before the vote.</LD>
<TE>   They were joined by three United Torah Judaism lawmakers. Two
other party members voted against the plan to slash about $2.7
billion from the budget, which the ultra-Orthodox say will hurt the
poor. The bill passed its first reading Wednesday by a vote of 65 to
26.</TE>
<TE>   "The break with these parties is final. The matter is closed,"
Sharon told reporters after the vote.</TE>
<TE>   As the early-morning deadline drew near, Shas ministers packed
their government offices and moved out.</TE>
<TE>   Newspaper editorials praised Sharon for showing leadership in
standing up to parties that previous prime ministers had appeased. A
poll conducted by Yediot Aharonot newspaper Tuesday night showed that
70% of respondents supported Sharon's decision.</TE>
<TE>   But some analysts said that the dire economic situation left
Sharon little choice but to seek passage of the emergency measures.
The economy, mired in a recession, has seen the value of the shekel
erode, unemployment rise and foreign investment evaporate since the
current conflict with the Palestinians erupted in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Senior economists who met with the prime minister last week
"warned Sharon the economy is heading for the abyss with giant
steps," economic analyst Moti Bassok wrote in Haaretz newspaper
Wednesday. "If he didn't take matters in hand, he could find himself
being blamed for its collapse."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's dismissal of the two ultra-Orthodox parties leaves him
with just 60 seats in the 120-seat Knesset. He opened talks Wednesday
with the far-right National Union Party hoping to draw it into the
coalition to give himself a majority.</TE>
<TE>   The prime minister sent an envoy to meet with National Union
leader Avigdor Lieberman, who pulled the party out of the government
this year because, he said, Sharon was not doing enough to crush the
Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not ruling anything out; I'm not making any commitments,"
Lieberman said in an interview with Israel Television. "Everything is
open."</TE>
<TE>   There was widespread speculation that Sharon might seize the
moment--with polls ranking him the most popular politician in the
country--to call early elections. His tough stance toward the
Palestinians and the ultra-Orthodox has left him well-positioned to
battle his rival, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for
leadership of the Likud Party, pundits said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "[Sharon's] associates are convinced that in a situation like
this, when his standing in the polls has never been better, he will
walk right over Benjamin Netanyahu," wrote Ben Caspit in Yediot
Aharonot.</TE>
<TE>   In the complex world of Israeli coalition politics, however, Shas
might yet rejoin the government, even after being humiliated by
Sharon. The party's leaders were said to be stunned that Sharon had
chosen to punish them so harshly and were searching for ways to reach
a compromise that would return them to a role in the coalition.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that he will return to his senses," Shas lawmaker
Yitzhak Peretz said of Sharon. "In the end, the weak groups will
benefit from our opposition [to the budget cuts], and the prime
minister will understand that he will have no coalition without
Shas."</TE>
<TE>   The economic package--which calls for tax hikes in addition to
budget cuts--must still pass two more votes in the Knesset before it
can become law. Those votes are expected to be held in two weeks.
Sharon has said privately that if the ultra-Orthodox parties vote in
favor of the package then, he might take them back.</TE>
<TE>   For Sharon, the prospect of governing without Shas is
uncomfortable. The party's 17 seats make it the third-largest bloc in
the Knesset. Its ministers usually backed Sharon's policies toward
the Palestinians, whether he was launching military actions or
speaking of holding talks.</TE>
<TE>   Without Shas, the government is made up of Likud, the center-left
Labor Party and some smaller far-right parties.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's governing partners might take advantage of his narrow
majority to make demands on him.</TE>
<TE>   "It is going to be a very tough era," Likud Whip Zeev Boim told
The Times in an interview Wednesday night.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Turns Aside Pleas for Wider Afghan Force</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Security Council is to extend term of Kabul
peacekeepers. Some experts fear refusal to patrol outlying areas may
harm political goals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UNITED NATIONS--The Security Council, rejecting pleas to move
peacekeepers into Afghanistan's volatile and often lawless outlying
provinces, is ordering the international security force to remain
confined to the capital, diplomats here said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The 15-member council is expected to formally authorize today a
six-month extension of the existing peacekeeping force, which numbers
fewer than 5,000 and is restricted by the world body to the area in
and around Kabul, the Afghan capital.</LD>
<LD>   With Afghanistan two weeks away from convening a national council
that will be responsible for creating a transitional government, some
U.N. experts and political analysts argue that this democratic
experiment could be jeopardized unless peacekeepers expand their
presence beyond the capital.</LD>
<TE>   In a House vote Tuesday authorizing a $1.3-billion aid package for
Afghanistan, U.S. legislators echoed these concerns and asked
President Bush to report back in 45 days with a plan addressing that
country's "immediate and long-term security needs."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), chairman of the House International
Relations Committee, and Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have voiced support for
deploying the international force outside Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has strongly opposed such a move, arguing
that peacekeepers might inadvertently hamper the military campaign
against the remnants of the Taliban regime and of the Al Qaeda
terrorist network. Other Security Council powers are disinclined to
challenge the U.S. position or volunteer their own troops for an
expanded peacekeeping force.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey, which is taking over command from Britain of the
International Security Assistance Force, or ISAF, has agreed only to
the limited mission approved by the council last year.</TE>
<TE>   A vote to keep the peacekeeping force in place until December does
not preclude adjustments in its size or scope during the next six
months, diplomats note. "We do not think there is a need for
expansion right now, but there might be in the future," said a U.S.
official here, speaking on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   But diplomats acknowledge that the issue is unlikely to be raised
anew in coming months by council members with troops in Afghanistan,
and countries that have not contributed forces are reluctant to
insist that others expand their commitment.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the United States, Britain and Germany are training
Afghan troops who, they hope, can be forged into a viable army and
police force.</TE>
<TE>   In the draft resolution extending the ISAF mandate, which
diplomats said was supported by all 15 members in closed-door
discussions Wednesday, the Security Council stressed that
"responsibility for providing security and law and order throughout
the country resides with the Afghans themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Afghan interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai asked the council
earlier this year to authorize a much larger peacekeeping mission.
His foreign minister proposed a force of 20,000 troops, with units
stationed in the cities of Herat, Kandahar, Jalalabad and
Mazar-i-Sharif, as well as Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, though, Afghan officials have muted their insistence, in
what diplomats here say is a gesture of deference to the United
States and a reflection of their preoccupation with the loya jirga,
the weeklong national assembly scheduled to open June 10 in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   "In principle, the Afghan side is desirous to have the ISAF
expanded further to some other provinces," said Ravan Farhadi,
Afghanistan's ambassador here. "But I don't think it is an urgent
matter. There is nothing that seems to endanger the convening of the
loya jirga on the 10th of June."</TE>
<TE>   "They know that it's not going to happen," said a British
diplomat, who asked not to be identified. Moreover, the diplomat
said, the U.S.-led coalition forces fighting in the country "are
having more of a deterrent effect" on crime and internal political
strife than the interim government had anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   But U.N. officials and independent analysts say the security
situation in southern and eastern Afghanistan appears increasingly
precarious, with well-armed tribal leaders able to challenge whatever
government emerges from the loya jirga.  Critics of the Bush
administration's resistance to a force expansion include three former
U.S. ambassadors to the United Nations--Richard Holbrooke, Donald
McHenry and Jeane Kirkpatrick--who rarely see eye to eye on other
foreign policy issues.</TE>
<TE>   "The signal that the refusal to expand ISAF sent is that the
international community is not ready to devote the resources needed
to ensure security throughout the country," said Alexander Thier, an
Afghanistan expert at the International Crisis Group, who just spent
six weeks touring the country. "So the warlords will become
emboldened."</TE>
<TE>   The International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based humanitarian aid
organization, called last week for peacekeepers to safeguard smaller
cities where delegates are being elected for the June 10 assembly.</TE>

<HD>Mistaking Trees for a Forest?</HD>
<DH>Southern timber harvest replaces native hardwoods with rows
of pines. Critics decry loss of habitat but industry says the
practice spares wild areas.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SPENCER MOUNTAIN, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>If many trees are cut down in a forest, but others are planted to take
their place, is it still a forest?</LD>
<LD>   Or is a forest something more elusive: a repository of varied life
forms, a cradle for clear-running streams, a historical continuum
where children and their fathers and grandfathers can sit atop old
stumps, watch for squirrels and talk?</LD>
<LD>   That's the question posed here in central Tennessee, where giant
timber-cutting machines shear native trees off Spencer Mountain like
skin off a black bear.</LD>
<TE>   Mathematically, clear-cutting tens of thousands of trees is not a
problem. The South is growing more trees than it is cutting down. By
mid-century, trees may well cover more ground than they do today.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is that as the timber industry cuts the region's
slow-growing oaks, hickories and other hardwoods to feed the nation's
ravenous appetite for computer paper, chipboard and other consumer
products, it is sowing a sterile substitute: vast pine tree
plantations.</TE>
<TE>   Many biologists dismiss these new forests as nothing more than
agricultural fields planted with nonnative trees. A real forest, they
argue, is something more messy, primal and elusive--a place to learn
not just about nature and hunting but about the world of your
ancestors.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee is emblematic of the transformation sweeping the South,
which today produces more wood products than any single country on
Earth.</TE>
<TE>   The 13 Southern states account for nearly 60% of the nation's wood
output, almost four times the current volume of the once-mighty
Pacific Northwest. The escalating timber market is altering
landscapes from Georgia to Arkansas, turning oak forests, farm fields
and marshes into man-made seas of planted pine.</TE>
<TE>   The question of whether these pine stands are forests or farms is
a new turn in a centuries-old quarrel over the role forests play in
America.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the 1890s feud between two pioneering giants in their
fields--environmentalist John Muir and forester Gifford
Pinchot--about the purpose of the first forest preserves. Muir
envisioned them as preserves for wildness, containing "thousands of
God's wild blessings." Pinchot saw them as more utilitarian, where
trees would not only grow but provide valuable building materials.</TE>
<TE>   The new forests are not the forests that Tennesseans recall from
childhood.</TE>
<TE>   The trees are mostly loblolly pine, grown in rows, mostly the same
age, the same height and cut at the same time by giant machines. The
loblolly stands are fertilized and managed and devoid of many native
plants and animals.</TE>
<TE>   Government and industry foresters say the plantations are highly
productive and emulate many of the roles of natural tree stands. More
efficient forests, they say, mean that more wilderness can remain
unscathed. Timber companies contend that years of "high-grading" in
old groves--harvesting the best and strongest trees--have weakened
forests, leaving behind spindly stands.</TE>
<TE>   "You end up with what a professor I had in school called 'green
junk,'" said Sharon Haines, International Paper manager of
sustainable forestry.</TE>
<TE>   Ecologists counter that given time and sunlight, a small oak will
grow larger, and that even a crooked tree can hold a songbird's nest.</TE>
<TE>   Most tree farms produce a single species, the fast-sprouting
loblolly, in place of a slower growing mixture of native Tennessee
oaks, hickories and sycamores. The loblollies can be harvested by
machine and replaced with seedlings in as little as 25 years, two to
five times faster than the regrowth of a traditional forest.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of Southern land devoted to pine plantations will
increase 67% to 54 million acres--an area the size of Utah--by 2040,
predicts a U.S. Forest Service report. Natural forests of all types
will decline 17%, meanwhile, with the most dramatic conversion
occurring in Tennessee, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Graden, forestry development manager for Bowater Inc., one
of Tennessee's largest timber companies, is proud of his new forests.</TE>
<TE>   He shows off a stand of young, green loblollies, saying they
provide nesting habitat for quail, shelter for deer, wild turkeys and
rabbits, easy foraging for hawks and eagles.</TE>
<TE>   But Graden and other forest experts concede that when planted
loblollies grow taller, the sunlight dims and creatures disperse.</TE>
<TE>   "As the canopy closes on a planted pine stand, that diversity will
drop off rather substantially," said David Wear, coauthor of the
recent Forest Service report.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service report regards the growth of plantations as an
important hedge against suburban sprawl, which the authors say is the
single greatest threat to Southern forests.</TE>
<TE>   Paul E. Davis, director of water pollution control at the
Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, said pine
plantations treat the land and water more gently than, say, a
100-store mall surrounded by acres of asphalt. "It's good for clean
water in Tennessee to see a viable forestry industry, because that
keeps the land use from changing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The conversion to plantations has been going on for half a
century. But the process accelerated in the last two decades as
Fortune 500 timber companies moved away from the Northwest to the
friendlier regulatory atmosphere of the South. Most Southern forests
are privately owned and immune from the environmental restrictions
imposed on the federal forests of the West.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike California, most Southern states do not require timber
companies that cut trees on private land to draw up plans to protect
wildlife and water quality. Tennessee requires no notification before
land is logged.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is there a lone imperiled species, like the Northern spotted
owl, which became the icon of the Northwest timber wars. No single
forest creature has emerged to trigger federal endangered-species
laws across the South. Nor can even a small number of Southern
forests be called "primeval," as in the West, since generations of
Southern settlers cleared trees for farmland that in time were
overgrown by new forests.</TE>
<TE>   Today's pine plantations flourish on abandoned farms in southern
Appalachia and the Mississippi Valley, in Florida grasslands, Alabama
river valleys and in the coastal lowlands of the Carolinas.</TE>
<TE>   Around Spencer Mountain and elsewhere in rural Van Buren County,
neon green swaths of nonnative loblollies intermingle with the brown
bark of hardwoods. Thin bands of trees called beauty strips still
line the roads, masking the clear-cuts beyond.</TE>
<TE>   "They hurt this mountain out here. It ain't nothing but a pile of
brush," said William Bouldin, 84, whose father taught him to cut
trees one at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Van Buren County has lost more native forest than all six
neighboring counties on the Cumberland Plateau, according to a new
study commissioned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</TE>
<TE>   Hardwood clear-cuts in the county were immense--averaging 186
acres, 50% beyond the timber industry's own recommended limit for
clear-cuts, said the director of the study, Jonathan P. Evans,
associate biology professor at the University of the South in
Sewanee, Tenn. The study focused on the plateau because it is part of
a region valued for its biological diversity.</TE>
<TE>   The best example of the area's natural treasures is Fall Creek
Falls State Park, which features deep forested gorges, ancient
bonsai-sized cedars and a 256-foot-high waterfall, the highest east
of the Rockies.</TE>
<TE>   Ecologists fear that soil runoff from clear-cutting is sullying
the crystalline creeks that flow through the park and support fish,
mussels and other aquatic creatures. After recent flooding, muddy
runoff from treeless hillsides turned Fall Creek Lake the color of
chocolate milk.</TE>
<TE>   For botanists, a walk through a heavily cut hardwood forest
becomes a hunt for clues that it still functions as a biological
haven. Chris Bullington, a botanist with the Nature Conservancy of
Tennessee who grew up on the plateau, says he sometimes can't find a
single rare flower or skittering salamander, and he wonders then if
the forest has been cut too many times to be repaired. Then he spots
a sign--an unusual white fringeless orchid, perhaps, sheltered by
ferns--and he is reassured.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's been operating on the notion there's plenty of trees.
No one's been keeping score," Bullington said. "Now people are
bumping into each other--'Oh, you've been cutting trees on the other
side of the hill, and I've been cutting on this side.'"</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee forester Ronald Measles grew up in the woods around
Spencer Mountain, where his father took him hunting and taught him to
tell red oaks and white oaks apart by the shape of their leaves. He
did the same for his own son.</TE>
<TE>   Only two years ago, oak forests surrounded the small office on
Spencer Mountain where Measles works as a technician for the state
Division of Forestry. Today that office overlooks a clear-cut field.</TE>
<TE>   Not only have the old forests vanished, but so have the small
family-owned sawmills, and the freedom of children to hike and hunt
right down the road.</TE>
<TE>   The tiny county, population 5,200, is so impoverished that it is
only now building its first sewage treatment plant. It still has not
enjoyed an economic boom from the recent logging. Machines called
"feller-bunchers" scoop up piles of logs, much like the bright orange
"Super-Axe-Hacker" that harvested Truffula Trees in Dr. Seuss' "The
Lorax." As the timber companies stripped the hardwoods, few local
residents were hired to help.</TE>
<TE>   "They weren't employing anyone in the community. They weren't
buying anything in the community," said Van Buren County Executive
Kelly Dishman.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the clear-cut hardwood goes, not to small, traditional
industries, but to chip mills such as International Paper's Royal
Blue mill in Caryville, Tenn. It produces around 200,000 tons of
hardwood chips each year with a staff of seven. Most of those chips
are used to make paper.</TE>
<TE>   As chip mills proliferate, small manufacturers wonder where they
will get their hardwoods. The Burroughs-Ross-Colville Co. in
McMinnville has been crafting handles for axes and hammers since the
19th century. On an office shelf, one manager displays a hammer that
appears to be Tennessee-made, but in fact has a handle made of
foreign wood. That is perhaps the deepest fear: that not only are
local hardwoods disappearing, but the replacement wood will come from
overseas.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really changed, it sure has," Ronald Measles said. "The kids
worked in the woods, and cut timber. Now the timber's gone. It
probably won't be back in our lifetime."</TE>

<HD>INS Mix-Up Drops 3,500 From Travel 'Watch List'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK J. McDONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For nearly two months, the inspectors who monitor U.S. ports of entry
were working with a computerized watch list that omitted about 3,500
people identified as suspected criminals, potential terrorists or
otherwise ineligible to enter the U.S., authorities said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   At least one person was allowed to enter the country at Los
Angeles International Airport without vigorous inspection during the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's computer system breakdown,
which lasted from March 23 to May 15. Authorities said no one knows
if others who might have been flagged by the computers got through
during this time.</LD>
<LD>   A computer upgrade left a key border checklist without the 3,500
names. The list, widely used by immigration inspectors and other
agencies, is designed to alert authorities at airports and border
posts to the names of people who may be troublesome, said officials
familiar with the malfunction.</LD>
<TE>   One person known to have slipped through without detailed
inspection is a naturalized U.S. citizen from Iran who was under FBI
investigation for suspected links to terrorism, sources said. The
suspect, who arrived at LAX this month, was allowed into the United
States without being subject to systematic checks requested by the
FBI, the sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration officials said Wednesday they had fixed the problem
and were still trying to determine how many of the people who had
been improperly left off the watch list may have attempted to enter
the country through land borders, airports or seaports, according to
Russell Bergeron, an INS spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The breakdown seems likely to intensify criticism of the
beleaguered INS, which has faced widespread censure since the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks. Though all 19 hijackers initially entered the
United States with legal visas, the attacks exposed deep
vulnerabilities in the nation's system of screening and admitting
immigrants and visitors.</TE>
<TE>   A senior agency official in Washington familiar with the matter
acknowledged that the potential security breach was serious, but
voiced hope that few on the list opted to travel during the computer
snag. Authorities said there was no sign that sabotage occurred or
that any outsiders were aware of the mishap and in a position to
exploit it.</TE>
<TE>   "Before it's characterized as a catastrophic failure ... we would
want to look at how many individuals in that population actually
decided to travel to the U.S. during that time," said the senior INS
official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, Congress has directed the INS and its parent
agency, the Justice Department, to improve access to the alphabet
soup of federal law enforcement databases that serve as a line of
defense against terrorists and others deemed undesirable.</TE>
<TE>   Almost 2 million names are cataloged in the INS' National
Automated Immigration Outlook System, known as NAILS. Among them were
3,491 entries provided by the State Department, acting on possibly
incriminating evidence developed abroad, the senior INS official
said.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department "tip-off" entries tend to be people who
should be watched most seriously, the INS official said.</TE>
<TE>   People may be placed on federal lookout lists for a range of
reasons, from suspected criminal and terrorist activity to suspicious
travel patterns or visa irregularities. Some may have committed no
crime, while others may be fugitives.</TE>
<TE>   The NAILS system feeds into a broader database called the
Interagency Border Information System, which also displays lookouts
generated by a range of other agencies, including the Customs Service
and the Drug Enforcement Administration. In addition, IBIS lists
outstanding warrants compiled by the FBI from police agencies
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Because of its breadth of information and relative efficiency,
IBIS is the principal system used by immigration officials who
inspect the passports and other documents of tens of millions of
visitors each year.</TE>
<TE>   The IBIS system is designed to give authorities an opportunity to
keep out ineligible visitors, arrest criminal suspects attempting to
enter or question and search people otherwise eligible for entry.</TE>
<TE>   The problem that arose on this occasion, the INS official said, is
that the 3,491 names on the agency lookout did not all transfer
automatically into IBIS, as is supposed to happen.</TE>
<TE>   The apparent reason: an INS computer maintenance effort designed
to "re-synchronize" its computers with the system used by the
Treasury Department, which runs IBIS. The technical adjustment--which
had never been done before--somehow resulted in the 3,491 names not
making it into IBIS.</TE>
<TE>   "It had been on our list of systems change requests for some
time," the senior INS official said of the maintenance. "It was a new
routine."</TE>
<TE>   The synchronization program was executed March 23, and, while some
"small discrepancies" were noted at the outset, the larger problem of
the missing names was apparently not noticed until the case of the
naturalized Iranian terrorism suspect at LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, if an IBIS computer check does not result in a
"hit"--and there is no other reason for the INS inspector to be
suspicious--visitors with valid documents are admitted to the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers whose names do register hits on the lookout database are
generally directed to secondary inspection, where they are questioned
more in-depth and officers have access to other computer checks.</TE>
<TE>   Since their names were placed on the INS lookout list, any of the
3,491 people attempting to enter the United States at a formal port
of entry would probably be referred to secondary inspection--if their
names had been transmitted to the IBIS system.</TE>
<TE>   Some might even be denied entry, and some could be subject to
arrest. Others might be allowed in after a more comprehensive
inspection. The INS could provide no breakdown of why the 3,491 ended
up on the lookout list.</TE>
<TE>   In the LAX case, sources reported that, at the FBI request, the
naturalized U.S. citizen from Iran suspected of links to an
unspecified terrorist group was placed on the INS lookout list in
late March.</TE>
<TE>   He was expected to be traveling back to the United States, and
authorities wanted him subjected to a comprehensive inspection--even
if, as a citizen, he was eligible for entry. In some cases, federal
authorities are known to have used such entry checks to search
suspects who are under surveillance, and even copy some of their
documents.</TE>
<TE>   The native of Iran arrived in the United States in mid-May and his
name did not show up as a lookout on the IBIS system.</TE>
<TE>   He was allowed to enter the United States without passing through
detailed inspection. Other details about his case were not available.</TE>

<KH>THE SECESSION DEBATE</KH>
<HD>Secession in Voters' Hands</HD>
<DH>Breakup: LAFCO places Valley cityhood on the November
ballot, and a powerful coalition of civic leaders gears up to keep
Los Angeles whole.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX and PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A six-year campaign to break the San Fernando Valley from Los Angeles
won a spot Wednesday on the November ballot, clearing the way for a
historic vote and uncorking a fierce political debate over the future
of the nation's second-largest city.</LD>
<LD>   The Local Agency Formation Commission voted 8 to 1 to place the
secession measure on the Nov. 5 citywide ballot. Its decision came
after a daylong hearing that swung between dry legalese and
impassioned pleas to "free the Valley."</LD>
<LD>   "Today, what you are doing is making history," said Paula Boland,
a former state assemblywoman who has fought for Valley secession
since the 1970s. "You're telling almost a million and a half people
that democracy is alive and well in this country."</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski cast the lone
dissenting vote, saying she thought the panel needed more time to
review the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The commission's decision opens a debate whose outcome will
determine the shape and identity of Los Angeles. With the stakes high
for the Valley and the rest of the city, the campaign already has
begun to attract top civic leaders and dominate the agenda of Mayor
James K. Hahn, who is spearheading the fight against secession.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor brings some powerful allies to his cause. Former
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, former Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan, billionaire Eli Broad and real estate developer Ed
Roski are scheduled to meet with Hahn today to discuss how to bolster
the anti-secession campaign. Hahn has vowed to raise $5 million to
fight a breakup.</TE>
<TE>   After the vote, the mayor called secession "a one-way ticket to
financial disaster" and vowed to wage an aggressive campaign to
defeat the measure.</TE>
<TE>   "This fantasy that there's this utopia around the bend where you
can find better services for less money is just that, a myth, and
we're going to expose it," Hahn said. Valley secessionists,
meanwhile, hope to raise $2 million to $4 million and have hired a
political consulting firm known for guiding dozens of ballot measures
into law. They predicted a groundswell of support, fueled by dozens
of campaigns soon to be launched for seats in the Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   "They can get all the billionaires they want, but we have the
public," said Richard Close, chairman of the secession group Valley
VOTE. "This is Mayor Hahn's swan song; he has no support throughout
the city. The Valley has deserted him. South-Central has deserted
him."</TE>
<TE>   Secession backers promise that a Valley city would provide more
efficient, responsive government. Opponents insist that it would only
spawn more bureaucrats and diminish services on both sides of the
Santa Monica Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   While couched in the arid language of municipal budgets and
services, the Valley secession drive taps deep-seated sentiments in
Los Angeles, pitting those who yearn for more local control against
those who see the city's far-flung neighborhoods and unparalleled
diversity as its strength.</TE>
<TE>   "Support is growing throughout Los Angeles," said Valley VOTE
President Jeff Brain. "The residents, the taxpayers want a change.
The opponents are selling what we call 'fud'--fear, uncertainty and
doubt ....The Valley is selling hope. We're asking people to trust
themselves to form a new city."</TE>
<TE>   In a hint of campaign themes to come, Hahn warned that secession
would hurt public safety by jeopardizing bonds to pay for Valley
police and fire stations. "The cost to the city's taxpayers will go
up and services will go down ... both in the Valley city and the
remaining city," he told LAFCO. "We think public safety is
jeopardized."</TE>
<TE>   Addressing that concern, the commission gave the city until
election day to issue the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the meeting chamber, a Van Nuys woman chased after the
departing mayor, shouting: "Just let us vote!" Hahn turned and faced
her before a bank of television cameras. "I'm not trying to delay the
vote," he said. "I want you to vote!"</TE>
<TE>   The push for Valley cityhood is one of a trio of Los Angeles
secession proposals aiming for the voting booth this fall. In the
next two weeks, LAFCO must decide whether to put plans for Hollywood
and harbor-area independence, both hobbled by questions about their
financial strength, on the ballot alongside Valley secession.</TE>
<TE>   If Los Angeles were to lose all three regions, the city's size and
population would be cut roughly in half. The Valley alone has 1.35
million residents.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be a real test for Hahn," said Allan Hoffenblum, a
Republican political analyst. "If 1.3 million people leave his city,
that could cause severe problems if he wants to get re-elected. I
don't think he wants secession as his legacy."</TE>
<TE>   Julie Butcher, head of the largest city employees union, told her
members to "prepare for the biggest political fight in our
city-worker lives." She said city jobs could be threatened if
secession passes.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to marshal every resource and every city worker that
we represent--and even those we don't represent," said Butcher,
general manager of Service Employees International Union, Local 347.
"A worker in South Gate understands what's at stake. This is really
about the future of public jobs. If half of the nation's
second-largest city decides to bail on the rest of us, it really has
an impact on all of us."</TE>
<TE>   Secession drives have been victorious in states such as Florida,
but none has been waged on the grand scale presented by the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "This is monumental," said Peter Muller, an urban geographer at
the University of Miami. "As always, Los Angeles is first. If
[secession] wins, and it looks like there's a very good chance it
could, it could usher in a whole new urban era."</TE>
<TE>   Voting in favor of putting secession on the ballot were county
Supervisors Yvonne Brathwaite Burke and Zev Yaroslavsky, Diamond Bar
Councilwoman Carol Herrera, Pico Rivera Councilwoman Beatrice Proo,
retired judge James DiGiuseppe, former school board member Henri
Pellissier and water board members William Wentworth and Jerry
Gladbach.</TE>
<TE>   To pass, secession must attract a majority of voters citywide and,
in a separate tally, a majority within the breakaway area. A Times
poll taken in March showed that 55% of Valley voters thought the
Valley should secede, compared with 46% of the city's entire
electorate. Citywide, more voters favored secession than opposed it.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, a longtime foe of secession, questioned the depth of
Valley discontent.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not like an angry revolution going on. I think it's just
some people who came up with the idea and some politicians in
Sacramento that really should have minded their own business,"
Riordan said. "Right now, I think support both for and against
secession is paper thin. Hopefully, people are starting to focus on
it. We've got to educate them."</TE>
<TE>   Voters will be asked simply to approve or deny Valley
independence. But underpinning that question are reams of budget data
showing, at least in the eyes of LAFCO, that the Valley could thrive
as a separate city without injuring the financial well-being of the
city it leaves behind.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles officials have hotly contested that finding, arguing
that secession would punch a multimillion-dollar hole in the city
treasury. Debate over financial effects raged until the eleventh-hour
Tuesday, when LAFCO again revised its calculations and more than
doubled the amount an independent Valley would have to pay Los
Angeles to make up for lost tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Pellissier, LAFCO's chairman, said the vote puts the onus on
secession supporters to make their case.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm delighted we were able to reach the conclusion we did, but
the facts were there," Pellissier said. "We made the decision that
they should have the right to vote. It's fiscally viable."</TE>
<TE>   A breakup would disrupt almost a century and a half of nonstop Los
Angeles expansion. The Valley, once a patchwork of ranchland and
orchards, joined the city in 1915 so that it could obtain water from
the 233-mile Los Angeles Aqueduct. Areas with their own wells, such
as Burbank and Glendale, remained independent.</TE>
<TE>   If Valley secession is approved by voters, the new city would be
born on July 1, 2003. It would instantly become the nation's
sixth-largest city, bigger than Phoenix, San Diego, Dallas and
Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley would have a $1-billion budget, an elected mayor and 14
city council members. Voters who live in the Valley would elect those
leaders and choose the city's name on the same November ballot. The
five selections range from the obvious (San Fernando Valley) to the
dreamy (Camelot).</TE>
<TE>   To keep Los Angeles financially whole, the Valley would have to
pay $128 million the first year. This so-called alimony payment would
drop 5% annually over 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   For at least its first year, the fledgling city would remain
tightly bound to Los Angeles. The Valley would contract with Los
Angeles for almost all municipal services, but eventually could set
up its own departments and hire employees.</TE>
<TE>   But many uncertainties remain about the long-term health of both
cities. Los Angeles officials still say their city will be left with
centralized costs, such as running the 911 system, if the Valley
breaks away. A financial firm last week warned investors that
secession might hurt Los Angeles' bond rating.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so much more we as a city need to know before we can make
a qualified or educated decision," said Xavier Flores, vice president
of the Mexican American Political Assn., which opposes secession.
"The residents of Los Angeles, and that includes people in the
Valley, have everything to lose. If there is a mistake or an
oversight, we're the ones who are going to have to pay."</TE>
<TE>   The breakup would displace the four Los Angeles City Council
members who represent the Valley and force the remainder of the city
to redraw its council districts. As an alternative to secession,
Councilwoman Wendy Greuel, a newly elected Valley representative, has
proposed a system that would divide the city into boroughs, each with
power to make local planning and budget decisions.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, a Valley city would always rely on Los Angeles.
After almost nine decades together, the two regions were found to be
so intertwined that certain systems, like water, power and sewer
lines, would be impossible to untangle. So LAFCO decided that the old
city would be forced to provide utility services to the Valley at the
same rates Los Angeles customers pay.</TE>
<TE>   Barring a successful lawsuit, the LAFCO decision is all but final.
Only a written protest from half of the Valley's registered
voters--about 300,000 people--could derail the election.</TE>
<TE>   But LAFCO still has time to tinker with the breakup plan.
California law requires a 30-day "reconsideration" period, during
which any interested party can ask the commission to review its
decision.</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors will then hold a hearing on the
written protests before formally placing the measure on the ballot.
The supervisors have no discretion over the breakup plan; their role
is merely administrative.</TE>
<TE>   For Valley secession leaders, a determined band of mostly white,
mostly male suburbanites, getting their proposal onto the ballot is a
stunning victory. It required years of steady pressure against state
and local governments that once swatted aside the idea of secession
like a harmless, if bothersome, fly.</TE>
<TE>   An early Valley cityhood drive was crushed in the 1970s when the
state Legislature, at the urging of then-Mayor Tom Bradley, gave
large cities veto power over secession.</TE>
<TE>   But grumbling over city services and the Valley's perceived lack
of clout at City Hall persisted. Two decades later, some leaders of
the original secession movement were finally in a position to do
something about it. Boland, who was by then an assemblywoman, revived
the issue in 1996 with a bill that would have granted voters the
power to approve secessions. The measure failed. The following year,
state Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) and Assemblyman Bob
Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) crafted a compromise requiring secession
proposals to win voter approval in both the breakaway area and the
city at large. In 1997, Gov. Pete Wilson signed the so-called Valley
secession bill, breathing new life into dormant movements throughout
suburban Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Valley secessionists were the first to collect enough
signatures--from 25% of registered voters--to force a study of Valley
cityhood. It took LAFCO more than two years and $2 million to conduct
the analysis. In a series of findings, the agency concluded that
secession was viable, and it dismissed city arguments to the
contrary.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's an underlying feeling that people should have a
right to self-determination wherever it's feasible," said William
Fulton, an urban planner and author of books about Southern
California growth.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the secession drive spun forward, the Valley grew to
resemble more and more the city it sought to escape.</TE>
<TE>   A Valley city, though still whiter than the rest of Los Angeles,
would have nearly even numbers of white and Latino residents.
Democrats now outnumber Republicans in most Valley districts. And
among the leafy bedroom communities are large pockets of poverty,
particularly in the northeast Valley.</TE>

<HD>Terrorist Ties Cited in Memo</HD>
<DH>FBI: Agent's July report, shared with CIA, 'was very
specific. It named names,' one official says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU and JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A Phoenix FBI agent who wrote a memo last year warning about
suspicious Middle Easterners at flight schools had developed detailed
information before Sept. 11 linking Arizona students to Osama bin
Laden and to a radical British Islamic group, and he shared some of
his concerns with the CIA, law enforcement sources said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Agent Kenneth Williams suspected that a group of about eight
Middle Eastern men in the Phoenix area were not merely studying at
flight schools but also had shown a keen interest in airplane
engineering and airport construction and security, according to
sources familiar with the closed-door briefings Williams gave members
of Congress this week.</LD>
<LD>   His review also determined that one of the Arizona flight school
students appeared to have communicated through a middleman with one
of Bin Laden's top aides, Abu Zubeida, and that several of the
students under suspicion had links to a radical group called
Al-Muhajiroun. The Britain-based group is dedicated to the
establishment of a global Muslim state and has vocally supported Bin
Laden and other terrorists.</LD>
<TE>   The still-secret memo that Williams prepared in July, warning that
the FBI should canvass flight schools around the country for possible
terrorist ties, has become Exhibit A in the eyes of some members of
Congress who accuse the Bush administration and the intelligence
community of missing possible warning signs before Sept. 11. Scrutiny
has focused on who knew about the Phoenix memo and why the document
never made it above middle FBI management before the attacks on the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Dick Cheney, asked Wednesday on CNN's "Larry King
Live" whether Williams was prophetic, said: "I think he was." Cheney
acknowledged that "there's a lot we can do" to improve the flow of
intelligence information, but he said much of the recent criticism
connected to the Williams memo represents "Monday morning
quarterbacking."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, administration officials say they had no tangible warnings
that could have led them to predict that an attack was imminent. And
Rep. Porter J. Goss (R-Fla.), who is helping lead the congressional
inquiry into the attacks, said in an interview after a classified
briefing with Williams on Wednesday that "no smoking gun" has emerged
to dispute that claim.</TE>
<TE>   But the new details suggest for the first time that the CIA may
have had advance knowledge of some of the suspicions generated from
Arizona. And the details also appear at odds with authorities'
contention that Williams was only pursuing "a hunch"--not actual
evidence--in warning about the risk of flight schools.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not a vague hunch," according to a congressional source
familiar with a classified briefing Williams gave to lawmakers. "He
was doing a case on these guys. He put in all the history about this
pattern of radical Muslims and [Bin Laden having] links to Arizona.
He talked about fatwas  [religious edicts] targeting U.S. airports.
He noted that one guy was asking about airport security--that's
specific information, not guesswork." The memo "was very specific. It
named names," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the FBI and the CIA declined to discuss the issue
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   But, asked about the CIA's role in the Phoenix case before Sept.
11, an official said "FBI headquarters requested some name traces on
some Middle Eastern individuals that they had concerns about." While
the details of that request remain unclear, "it could have been that
they had some individuals in Arizona who came up on their radar
screen that they were interested in," said the official, who asked
not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA's knowledge of the case appears to have gone beyond a
fairly routine request by the FBI for the CIA to come up with
information on suspected individuals. Williams also discussed his
concerns regarding the Arizona flight schools with field-level
intelligence counterparts at the CIA, according to a government
official familiar with what Williams told members of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's initial inquiries to the CIA last year regarding the
Phoenix suspicions did not produce any positive links to terrorists,
the official said.</TE>
<TE>   But after Sept. 11, the CIA confirmed that at least two of the
flight school students under suspicion in Arizona had links to Al
Qaeda, and evidence indicated that one person had communication
through a third party with "a very close associate of Bin
Laden"--namely Zubeida, the official said. The nature of that
communication was not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Williams also told lawmakers that his interest in the flight
school issue was piqued last year because Bin Laden had known ties to
Arizona, the official said. This was an apparent reference to
Egyptian Essam al Ridi, a Bin Laden operative who trained to be a
pilot in the United States and purchased a used military aircraft in
Arizona for Bin Laden in 1993 for $210,000. He then flew the Saber-40
twin-engine passenger jet to Sudan.</TE>
<TE>   One focus of Williams' memo is the suspected link between Arizona
flight students and the radical group Al-Muhajiroun, which loosely
means "The Emigres," according to several sources familiar with the
memo.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in Britain long have investigated the group and its
leader, Sheikh Omar Bakri Mohammad, a London-based Muslim cleric who
has dubbed himself the "mouth, eyes and ears of Osama bin Laden."
Those investigations focused on whether Al-Muhajiroun was one of many
front organizations for Al Qaeda and whether it had engaged in any
terrorist activities, including recruiting and sending young Muslim
militants to Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan. It has openly
issued calls to arms against the U.S. and its allies.</TE>
<TE>   A former FBI official who recently left the bureau said that, had
the Phoenix memo not hit a dead end at FBI headquarters before Sept.
11, it could have led to significant information about Al Qaeda
terrorist cells within the United States, including Al-Muhajiroun
supporters.</TE>
<TE>   The former FBI official said Al-Muhajiroun itself was not under
active investigation but that anyone associated with it had drawn FBI
scrutiny because of their suspected ties to other radical
organizations, including Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a radical group with radical ideological leanings," the
former official said. "So it would be naive to think that, even if
the group says it engages just in political or public relations
activity, that that's all it does and that none of its members are
involved in other types of logistical, financial or direct support of
terrorist activity. You can be a member of Al-Muhajiroun and it would
be very likely that you were a member or supporter or sympathizer of
Al Qaeda."</TE>
<TE>   Steven Emerson, a terrorism consultant to Congress, said the group
recruits young militants in England and claims to provide them with
military training there and elsewhere. Efforts to reach the group,
which has a Web site filled with virulent anti-American rhetoric,
were unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   The detailed nature of the case laid out by the memo is likely to
intensify questions from members of Congress about whether the
intelligence community missed warning signs that could have headed
off a possible attack. But Goss, who chairs the House Intelligence
Committee, cautioned against any rush to judgment.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't got any smoking gun. I haven't even got a cap pistol,"
he said. In general, Goss said, "I have not found a single instance
of omission yet where someone had something they should have sent to
someone else or anything that is an obvious failure. The next
question is, were the procedures in the FBI appropriate, and I can't
answer that question. All those questions are going to be answered in
our report" later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Goss refused to discuss the substance of the briefing his panel
got from Williams and the FBI but said that "our time this morning
was astonishingly well spent."</TE>

<HD>Breaking Language Barrier of Bankruptcy Bill</HD>
<DH>Congress: Impasse over section aimed at abortion foes is
likely to be resolved. Measure would require more people to work out
repayment plans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The key figures in a congressional impasse that has snarled a
sweeping bankruptcy reform bill agreed Wednesday to try to resolve
their differences and clear the way for the measure's passage.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) and Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.)
expressed confidence that they could come up with mutually acceptable
language to keep abortion foes from using bankruptcy filings to avoid
financial liability for illegal blockades of abortion clinics.
Schumer, an abortion-rights supporter, has been pushing the
provision; Hyde, an abortion foe, has fought it.</LD>
<LD>   Agreement on the issue would remove the last major obstacle to
passage of legislation designed to tighten bankruptcy laws. The bill
is backed by a coalition of creditors who contend it has become too
easy for Americans to dodge their debts in bankruptcy court.</LD>
<TE>   "We haven't gotten as far as I had hoped," said Rep. F. James
Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.), chairman of a House-Senate conference
committee negotiating the bill. "But we have gotten closer to
defining the [abortion] issue better."</TE>
<TE>   Among the bill's major provisions are rules that would require
more people to file under Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code, which
requires them to work out partial repayment plans with their
creditors, instead of under Chapter 7, which eliminates debts.</TE>
<TE>   Sensenbrenner said the conferees would meet again in about two
weeks to consider the legislative language drafted by Hyde and
Schumer.</TE>
<TE>   The two issues have become entangled because anti-abortion
activists have used bankruptcy filings to avoid paying judgments
under a 1994 law that allows clinics to sue protesters who obstruct,
intimidate or interfere with their operations.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate version of the bill includes a provision sponsored by
Schumer that would make such fines "nondischargeable," meaning they
could not be eliminated in a bankruptcy proceeding. The House measure
contains no such provision, and Hyde has led the effort to keep the
language out of the final bill.</TE>
<TE>   Schumer told members of the conference committee that bankruptcy
filings have become a favorite tactic of activists who conduct
illegal blockades designed to shut down abortion clinics. At least
one organization even requires its members to promise they will file
for bankruptcy if they become subject to court judgments, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hyde said he opposed Schumer's amendment because he feared it
would discourage peaceful protest by persecuting "the 85-year-old
retired nun standing in front of an abortion clinic who crosses a
police line she couldn't see or didn't know was there."</TE>
<TE>   But he said he would be willing to accept language that is clearly
targeted at participants in the kind of illegal blockades that shut
down many abortion clinics before passage of the 1994 law.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the bankruptcy bill expressed relief at the prospect
of a compromise. "Chuck and Henry have agreed on a principle here,"
said Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.). "It seems to me we're there,
and it's just a matter of getting the language."</TE>

<LD>MASSACHUSETTS</LD>
<LD>   An appeals panel refused to reduce defrocked priest John J.
Geoghan's nine- to 10-year sentence for groping a boy, a punishment
his lawyer called overly harsh.</LD>
<LD>   Geoghan's attorney, Geoffrey Packard, argued that Geoghan, 66, had
no prior convictions and was penalized in part due to the massive
publicity surrounding his and other cases of priest sex abuse.</LD>
<TE>   Geoghan was convicted in January for molesting a 10-year-old boy
in 1991. He was sentenced in February to nine to 10 years, with six
years of that to be served in prison, followed by life probation.</TE>
<TE>   Packard asked the court to reduce his sentence to two years of
prison time, with eight years of probation. He said he still intends
to pursue an appeal of Geoghan's conviction.</TE>

<HD>Remains in D.C. Park Identified as Intern's</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: A man and dog discover bones in dense woods that
police searched last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN BRAUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--More than a year after Modesto intern Chandra Levy
mysteriously disappeared, a passerby discovered her remains Wednesday
on a wooded slope in a remote area of Washington's Rock Creek Park.</LD>
<LD>   Medical examiners identified her through dental records. "The
remains found earlier today [under a pile of decomposing leaves] are,
in fact, Chandra Levy," said Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police
Chief Charles H. Ramsey. "The manner and cause of death is still
pending."</LD>
<LD>   The sudden recovery and identification of Levy's body altered the
dynamics of a case that had captured the nation's attention for much
of last year, only to fade after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   "This is no longer a missing persons investigation," Ramsey said.
"It's being handled as a death investigation. And once we find the
manner and the cause of death, it could change again."</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes after medical examiners found a positive match
between a recovered skull and dental records provided by Levy's
parents, police officials said homicide detectives and
Washington-based FBI agents were concentrating on the cause of Levy's
death. Ramsey said investigators probably would re-interview a number
of witnesses and "reconstruct the crime scene."</TE>
<TE>   "We have to go back over a lot of things," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although foul play has not been established, Ramsey raised the
possibility that Levy's body might have been moved to the secluded
hill where it was found.</TE>
<TE>   "The body could have been deposited" at the site after police
searchers went through the area last summer, Ramsey said. Noting that
the bones were found on a "very steep incline" deep inside a densely
wooded section of the 1,754-acre city park, Ramsey said it was
"difficult at this point to say this is the scene where she died."</TE>
<TE>   Although medical examiners have not yet been able to establish a
time of death, Ramsey said, the 24-year-old Levy's body was obscured
by leaves "consistent with someone who had been there for some time
prior to our winter." He added that "those leaves were from the
fall."</TE>
<TE>   Ramsey said he telephoned the missing girl's parents, Robert and
Susan Levy, at their Modesto home on Wednesday afternoon, just as
news reports began leaking out about their daughter's identification.
Ramsey said he had to relay the confirmation through the family's
lawyer, George Arata.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said the parents had an inkling that the body might be
Chandra's. About 9 a.m. PDT, only an hour after he and his wife had
appeared by a remote video feed on Oprah Winfrey's television show,
Robert Levy knocked at the door of neighbor Joanne Tittle.</TE>
<TE>   He was in tears, Tittle said.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday night, family representatives on both coasts spoke of
the couple's anguish. In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Billy Martin, a
Washington lawyer who represented the Levys in their dealings with
police, said: "This is the worst nightmare a parent can endure."
Martin, who has led a private investigation into Levy's
disappearance, added that the discovery of her body "does not solve
the mystery."</TE>
<TE>   In Modesto, Levy spokeswoman Judy Smith said that "up until the
point when they received the news, they were always hopeful." She
described their reaction as "very emotional, very tough. Certainly no
parent wants to bury their own child."</TE>
<TE>   Plans for a memorial service in Modesto were underway, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Body Found in</TE>
<TE>   'Treacherous' Terrain</TE>
<TE>   Levy's body was found near the rock-strewn Broad Branch Creek, on
a steep, rarely traveled slope described by residents as thick with
ferns, Virginia creeper vines and spreading beeches.</TE>
<TE>   "It's treacherous for walking," said Peter Chiles, a postal worker
who navigates that section of the park daily. "Dogs and deer have a
ball back there, and they dig up everything they find." Chiles said
that when he drove through the area Tuesday night, it was dark and
"completely barren."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Park Police Sgt. Scott Fear said that just before 9:30 a.m.
EDT Wednesday, a man walking his dog near the creek stumbled on what
appeared to be a human skull. The passerby had been "hunting turtles"
in the woods, Ramsey said later.</TE>
<TE>   According to Fear, the dog began tugging at the object. When the
man approached, he saw bones.</TE>
<TE>   "He ran down to a construction site and called park police," Fear
said. The arriving officer quickly summoned city police. By 10:30
a.m., detectives were swarming the woods, finding shreds of clothing
and more bones.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours, Ramsey said, they had recovered much of Levy's
remains.</TE>
<TE>   While police and a Smithsonian Institute forensic scientist poked
through the foliage, police evidence technicians kept everything at
the site until medical examiners removed the skull for the
pathological dental comparison with Levy's records.</TE>
<TE>   Ramsey and other officials would not comment on reports that
searchers found pieces of a tape player, shreds of a woman's jogging
suit and jewelry consistent with Levy's possessions. But some
artifacts, Ramsey said, "gave a strong suspicion they were articles
worn by Chandra Levy."</TE>
<TE>   Early on, some investigators had theorized that Levy, a physical
fitness enthusiast, had gone to Rock Creek Park on May 1, 2001, the
last day she was seen alive. In her apartment, police recovered a
laptop computer that indicated Levy had done an Internet search
listing Klingle Mansion, a stone dwelling about a mile south of where
the body was found.</TE>
<TE>   All last summer, District of Columbia detectives and police cadets
scoured the massive park, which cuts through central Washington. They
paid careful attention to the Klingle Mansion area, combing for days
in the high grass near the site.</TE>
<TE>   But they found only animal bones, clothes and other items that
could not be matched to Levy.</TE>
<TE>   "You could be standing next to something and just not see it" in
the vegetation, Ramsey said.</TE>
<TE>   Condit Endures</TE>
<TE>   Police Interest</TE>
<TE>   While investigators were looking into Levy's disappearance, they
met several times with Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres), who reportedly
acknowledged during questioning by detectives that he had an affair
with Levy.</TE>
<TE>   Ramsey and other police officials said at the time that Condit was
not considered a suspect. But detectives searched his apartment in
the Adams-Morgan district and officials asked in vain for him to
submit to an FBI polygraph exam. They publicly questioned his
willingness to aid their probe into Levy's disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   An attempt to reach Condit through longtime aide Mike Lynch was
unsuccessful. But the congressman released a statement saying that he
and his family "express their heartfelt sorrow to the Levy family."
The Levys "will remain in our prayers," they added.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Condit kept to the House floor and cloakroom and
was unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   He lost his six-term seat in a March reelection bid, apparently
victimized by what many saw as an unwillingness to tell police and
the public everything he knew.</TE>
<TE>   Condit was summoned in April before a federal grand jury
investigating Levy's disappearance and allegations of obstruction of
justice involving him and several staffers.</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento, California Gov. Gray Davis, once a political ally
of Condit, said: "I think all of us realized that something probably
happened to Chandra Levy. We were hoping against hope that somehow
she was still alive and the story would have a happy ending.</TE>
<TE>   "It is my hope that these events, tragic as they are, will bring
some closure to the Levy family."</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors leading the probes into Levy's death and
Condit's dealings with police officials also talked Wednesday of
closure--for the parents and for their 13-month investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Channing Phillips, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney, said the
identification of Levy's remains "brings some measure of closure to
the Levy family. "We still have a lot of work to do in terms of what
happened to Chandra Levy--if that can be determined."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Mark Arax in Fresno, Jenifer Warren in
Sacramento and Faye Fiore and Megan Garvey in Washington contributed
to this report.</TE>

<DH>Reaction: The lawmaker avoids the media, but he and House
colleagues express their sorrow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--As the news broke Wednesday on Capitol Hill that police
had identified the remains of Chandra Levy, Rep. Gary A. Condit
(D-Ceres) took refuge in his job: He stayed on the House floor, cast
votes on legislation and holed up in the Democratic cloakroom, out of
reach of the media pack that searched for him. His colleagues in the
House, meanwhile, expressed sorrow as the news spread through the
halls of Congress as fast as e-mail signals could flash between
handheld computers.</LD>
<LD>   "I hope it brings some closure to her family," Rep. Rob Portman
(R-Ohio) said somberly.</LD>
<LD>   House Democratic leaders were behind closed doors discussing the
day's major legislative battles when Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.)
announced the news to them, according to a source in the meeting.
Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) dropped her head into her hands.
A hush fell over the room.</LD>
<TE>   Other members quickly realized that the day's legislative news
would be eclipsed as media attention shifted again to the case of the
missing federal intern.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, Christ. Now the press are going to come asking stupid
questions again," said Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.).</TE>
<TE>   At Condit's office, at the end of a long, second-floor hallway in
a building across the street from the Capitol, reporters and camera
crews kept vigil throughout the afternoon and into early evening.</TE>
<TE>   But there was no sign of the besieged lawmaker. About 6 p.m.,
Condit's staff locked the office doors and left. The press corps
dispersed about 30 minutes later after concluding that there were
better odds of a Condit sighting in the corridors of the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   The only communication from Condit was a statement issued by his
office in which he expressed sorrow for the Levy family.</TE>
<TE>   His California colleagues were mum about the discovery. "I don't
know what to make of it," said Rep. Calvin M. Dooley (D-Visalia).</TE>
<TE>   Said a spokesman for Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento), "I
don't think he wants to comment on it."</TE>
<TE>   Others tried to go about their business. "I have not been in
Conditland for four hours," said a senior Democratic leadership aide.
"I've been engaged in serious business."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, before police confirmed that the remains found
in Rock Creek Park were Levy's, Condit could be seen sitting in the
House chamber in the back row, smiling and joshing with
colleagues--mostly like-minded conservative Democrats dubbed the
"Blue Dogs."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Warren Vieth contributed to this report.</TE>
<TE>(BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>Chandra Levy Timeline</TE>

aides deny their boss had an affair with Levy.</TE>
<TE>July 2: Flight attendant Anne Marie Smith alleges Condit asked
her to sign a declaration denying what she described as a
10-month affair. She also says Condit encouraged her not to talk
to investigators looking into the Levy disappearance. Condit

the affair.</TE>
<TE>July 10: With Condit's consent, police and FBI agents search his

<HD>Cuomo, Democrats at Odds</HD>
<DH>Politics: Ex-governor's son says he will take his candidacy
for N.Y.'s top job to the streets. He hopes to force a primary
against state comptroller.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Andrew Cuomo, the elder son of former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, turned his
back on the Democratic Party's state convention Wednesday and vowed
to take his gubernatorial campaign to the streets.</LD>
<LD>   Cuomo said he would circulate petitions to force a Sept. 10
gubernatorial primary against state Comptroller H. Carl McCall.</LD>
<LD>   "I want to be the candidate placed on the ballot by the people,
not the party," Cuomo told several hundred cheering supporters.</LD>
<TE>   McCall supporters scoffed.</TE>
<TE>   "He lost, so he cut and ran," party activist Sarah Kovner said.</TE>
<TE>   A top Cuomo supporter, Steven Pigeon, said one reason to announce
the move as the two-day convention opened was to steal the thunder
from McCall, whose troops said he had more than 60% of the delegates'
votes.</TE>
<TE>   But Pigeon also said: "Primaries are won in the streets. Why not
start your campaign in the street instead of in a smoky convention
hall?"</TE>
<TE>   Cuomo and McCall are locked in a tight battle for the Democratic
nomination to take on Republican Gov. George Pataki.</TE>
<TE>   Although Cuomo said he had more than the 25% of the delegate votes
needed for an automatic spot on the ballot, he prefers to mount a
grass-roots campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The delegates were treated to a keynote address by James Carville,
the Louisiana-bred political guru who helped put Bill Clinton in the
White House. Sporting sunglasses, rolled-up shirt sleeves and a
loosened tie, the "Ragin' Cajun" lit into Pataki.</TE>
<TE>   "My friends, he has accumulated a record not to run on, but a
record to run from," Carville roared to cheers from about 1,000
Democrats. Cuomo contended that he was releasing his delegates to
support McCall. "I want to congratulate Carl McCall," Cuomo said. "He
will earn the support of the party's establishment. He deserves it."</TE>
<TE>   Cuomo must collect the signatures of at least 15,000 party members
statewide to get on the primary ballot without the convention votes.</TE>

<HD>White House Subpoenaed Over Contacts With Enron</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: The Bush team defends its staff actions and
provides the Senate panel with information about letters, phone calls
and meetings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Escalating the confrontation between the legislative
and the executive branches over the Enron bankruptcy, a Senate
committee Wednesday issued the first congressional subpoenas directed
at the Bush White House, seeking information about its contacts with
officials of the energy giant.</LD>
<LD>   A few hours after the subpoenas were issued, the White House
provided the committee with summaries of dozens of
contacts--including letters, telephone calls and meetings--between
Enron officials and the administration. The summaries were being
prepared before the committee action, the White House said.</LD>
<LD>   The issuance of the subpoenas came after the administration, in a
separate fight, filed court papers seeking dismissal of a first-ever
lawsuit by the General Accounting Office against the executive
branch. The suit concerns private meetings held by Vice President
Dick Cheney's energy task force with industry groups.</LD>
<TE>   The White House contends that turning over any executive branch
information to Congress would make it more difficult for future
presidents and their staffs to seek candid advice. The Democrats, for
their part, are equally intent on asserting their oversight powers.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired by Sen. Joseph
I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), approved the subpoenas on a party-line vote
as part of its investigation into whether the government could have
done more to prevent Enron's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   The subpoenas--issued to the executive office of the president and
to Cheney's office--seek information on White House contacts with
Enron representatives about appointments to regulatory agencies and
the administration's energy policy. They also request Enron-related
communications between the White House and federal agencies.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokeswoman Anne Womack said the administration was
perplexed that Lieberman had chosen "this confrontational approach
rather than working cooperatively."</TE>
<TE>   In a nine-page letter to Lieberman sent late Wednesday, the
administration said it had found "no instance in which Enron
approached any person within the executive office of the president or
the office of the vice president seeking help in connection with its
financial difficulties prior to bankruptcy."</TE>
<TE>   The White House-Enron contacts listed in the letter were more
extensive than had previously been disclosed, though many included
large group meetings, telephone calls, letters or ceremonial events,
such as the 2001 White House Easter egg roll.</TE>
<TE>   The White House listed more than a dozen meetings--most already
publicized--between senior administration officials and Enron
representatives last year. Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay called and
wrote White House personnel director Clay Johnson recommending
appointing Patrick H. Wood III and Nora Brownell, among five others,
to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. While those two were
named, the White House said Lay had recommended 21 people, of whom
"only three ultimately received appointments."</TE>
<TE>   White House Counsel Alberto R. Gonzales had asked Lieberman to
delay the subpoenas, noting that he was searching White House visitor
entry files and e-mails in an effort to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   But Lieberman, a potential challenger to President Bush in 2004,
contended that the White House was not providing everything he needed
for his probe. After two months of unsuccessful negotiations with the
administration, he said, "this back-and-forth has continued, which
has ultimately frustrated the committee's work and frustrated my
patience."</TE>
<TE>   "This administration believes that the involuntary release of any
information will ultimately unravel presidential prerogatives," said
Marshall Wittmann, a scholar at the conservative Hudson Institute.
"The Bush White House views congressional subpoenas like
Transylvanian vampires view garlic."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for
Politics, added: "The Bush-Cheney administration is unusually
interested in preserving its executive privileges and maintaining
secrecy about its own decisions.... "</TE>
<TE>   "They're violating the basic rules of modern-day politics: get
information out quickly and completely, and support government in the
sunshine instead of the shade," Sabato said. "All the Bush
administration accomplishes in doing that is to convince people that
it has something to hide."</TE>
<TE>   But he noted: "It's also true that the Democrats want Enron to be
a major issue during the fall campaign."</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department filed court papers on Tuesday, seeking to
dismiss the GAO lawsuit. In a statement issued Tuesday, a department
spokeswoman said, "The GAO's assertion of virtually unlimited
authority to investigate the executive branch would revolutionize and
violate the separation-of-powers doctrine that has made our nation's
government so strong."</TE>
<TE>   The president also has fought with fellow Republicans over access
to information. Last December, Bush invoked executive privilege in
rejecting a subpoena issued by the GOP chairman of the House
Government Reform Committee for the Justice Department to turn over
records related to Clinton administration fund-raising and a
decades-old Boston mob case.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman said he was not accusing the White House of wrongdoing
in its dealings with Enron. "The clear message I've gotten from the
White House is that they're not going to give us what we want,"
Lieberman said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) said that he saw no justification for
subpoenaing the White House.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike the SEC, no one at the White House was responsible for
monitoring Enron's public disclosures," he said. "Unlike the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, no one at the White House was
responsible for regulating Enron's energy business."</TE>

<HD>Calculating the Sum of All Fears</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Threats raise the tension in New York and
elsewhere. But most go boldly on their way.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--Just as Americans had found a way to tame their fears and
move forward, the nation's leaders issued vague warnings of more
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Most people remain sanguine. But not here. New Yorkers, already
wired for caution, find themselves recalculating their daily risks:</LD>
<LD>   Is it safer to ride the subway or bus to work? Do the clothes in
the emergency backpack put together in the first month after Sept. 11
still fit the kids? Which public gathering spots are the most likely
targets this Memorial Day weekend? Is this for real this time?</LD>
<TE>   Melinda Moss, 48, was asking herself all those questions Wednesday
morning as she watched her children file into P.S. 6 on the Upper
East Side. Then she hopped a Fifth Avenue bus to midtown instead of
taking the usual subway ("I hate being underground at times like
this!"), and she promised herself she'd repack that backpack. "I
guess I've ratcheted up my tolerance level for fear, because I'm not
freaking out. But I'm also feeling unsafe again, like I did last
fall," said Moss, an executive secretary. As she passed the Empire
State Building, she instinctively lowered her head as if to avoid
falling objects. "I get a little crazy around buildings like this,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The city is again on high alert, with more police patrolling the
bridges, tunnels and select landmarks--and with the mayor and police
chief sending what has become the standard post-Sept. 11 mixed
message: Be cautious, but boldly go on with life.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Post headline writers, ever the hyperbolic town
criers, told readers Wednesday on the front page: "The Only Thing We
Have to Fear Is Fear Itself." At the same time, a headline on the
ever-balanced New York Times opinion page said: "Cool It!" Certainly,
this latest rough-ride over potential terrorism is not confined to
New York--even if New Yorkers like to make it their own.</TE>
<TE>   There have been other, nonspecific threats recently to places
across the country, such as the water supply in Orlando, Fla., and
apartment complexes in Northern California. And people seem in
general to be taking the steady stream of warnings in stride.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [the latest warning about inevitable attacks on U.S.
soil] is a real threat, but like every other threat we have heard
about in the last six months, too vague to really react to," said
Cindy Kline, an executive assistant who works in downtown Seattle. In
Los Angeles, law enforcement officials have taken the latest warnings
quite seriously, for example, establishing new guidelines for
landlords about how to look for suspicious tenants and holding
training sessions for emergency workers on preventing suicide
bombers. The City Council voted Wednesday to close four additional
streets near Los Angeles International Airport for 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   But a few people outside City Hall wondered whether government
officials might be too alarmist. Jose G. Valentino, a former Marine,
said, "Warnings should be given without scaring people."</TE>
<TE>   While tourists are not avoiding the standard sites--the Space
Needle in Seattle and the John Hancock Building in Chicago, for
example, had the usual number of visitors--they do carry some
anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   At the Hancock Building, Michele Hudson, 24, of Detroit said she
gets nervous when she hears warnings on television. "It's a holiday
weekend. I expected warnings," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles psychologist specializing in
trauma, said Americans now are suffering from what he calls
"anticipatory anxiety," something akin to sitting in a dentist's
office and listening to the drill in the next room.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorism expert Harvey Kushner agreed with government officials
who predict suicide attacks on shopping malls and apartments, saying
that Americans have to act as their own police.</TE>
<TE>   "The public is going to have to be better educated," he said. "We
have to have a system that traces people.... More than that, we need
resolve."</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie Valada-Viars, a college girl from Iowa, has resolve. But
she also has just moved into her first New York apartment--right
under the Brooklyn Bridge.</TE>
<TE>   That's one of the landmarks singled out for attack by an Al Qaeda
detainee debriefed by FBI agents. (The bridge is now under 24-hour
surveillance by police helicopters and was closed briefly Wednesday
because of a suspicious package, which turned out to be a hoax.)</TE>
<TE>   But Valada-Viars, 20, says she will not leave New York. Still, her
life these days feels like a road map for terrorist targets: She is
working at a Times Square restaurant, she rides the subway, the busy
South Street Seaport is two blocks from her apartment and Wall Street
is only a few more blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely uneasy living here," Valada-Viars said. She's not
expressing that to her mother back in Des Moines. "We're going to be
fine," she says about herself and her sister Kristina, an aspiring
actress also living in New York.</TE>
<TE>   But their mother, T Valada-Viars, who lives in a town where people
don't think about stowing emergency supplies in a backpack, is
nobody's fool. "I tell them: Be happy in your life. It's the best we
all can do. And then I worry. I can't stop worrying."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Kenneth Reich and J. Michael Kennedy in Los
Angeles and researchers Lynne Marshall in Seattle and John Beckham in
Chicago contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Klansman Convicted of 1963 Church Bombing</HD>
<DH>Trial: Defendant is guilty of first-degree murder in the
Birmingham case. He is given a life sentence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BIRMINGHAM, Ala.</DL>
<LD>The new South came to terms with an ugly chapter from its past
Wednesday when former Ku Klux Klansman Bobby Frank Cherry was found
guilty of first-degree murder for bombing a Baptist church and
killing four black girls 39 years ago. He was sentenced to life in
prison.</LD>
<LD>   The attack--and the fact that Cherry as a chief suspect had not
been brought to trial all those years--became a dark and unwanted
symbol of this once-segregated city ruled by George C. Wallace and
Bull Connor. Many people, black and white, wept quietly in the
crowded courtroom when the verdict was read.</LD>
<LD>   Cherry, 71, an ex-Marine trained in demolition, stood with his
hands in the pockets of his gray suit when the jury of nine whites
and three blacks filed back in Circuit Judge James Garrett's chambers
after six hours of deliberation. To each of the four counts, the
foreman said, "We, the jury, find the defendant guilty of
first-degree murder."</LD>
<TE>   Cherry showed not a flicker of emotion. Asked whether he had
anything to say, Cherry replied: "Yes, your honor. This whole bunch
[of witnesses] lied all the way through this thing. I told the truth.
I don't know why I'm going to jail for nothing."</TE>
<TE>   He held out his hands, a bailiff handcuffed them and Cherry, who
had been free on bail, was led into the adjoining jail, ending one of
the last major trials from the 1960s civil rights era.</TE>
<TE>   Although a prime suspect from day one, Cherry seemed destined to
remain so until investigators reopened the case in 1995, after five
of Cherry's estranged relatives and former friends told of hearing
him brag about the bombing. His granddaughter said he had boasted of
"blowing up a bunch of niggers back in Birmingham." Cherry was
indicted in 2000, but his trial was delayed because of questions
about his mental competence.</TE>
<TE>   On the steps of the Jefferson County courthouse Wednesday, two
middle-aged black men hugged. "Hey, soldier," said the first, using
the term that veterans of the civil rights marches still use for each
other, "after so many years...." And the second finished the sentence
for him: "Yes, after so many years, justice."</TE>
<TE>   Next to them, Eunice Davis, the sister of one victim, said, "I
still have flashbacks." Her sister, Cynthia Wesley, was 14 years old
when she was killed in the Sunday morning attack on the 16th Street
Baptist Church on Sept. 15, 1963.</TE>
<TE>   "Cynthia is not in my life and that's what hurts," Davis said.
"There will never be closure on this for me, but I trusted the jury
to do justice. It wouldn't have mattered if they were black or
white."</TE>
<TE>   For Birmingham, a city still haunted by its apartheid past, the
trial brought reflection and reevaluation in many quarters, and an
eerie echo of bygone days as eight blacks clapped and sang spirituals
in front of the courthouse: "Turn me 'round. Turn me 'round. Ain't
going to let Bull Connor turn me 'round." This time, though, the
police officers around them were both black and white.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly Birmingham is a different city than it was in the '50s
and '60s," said Marvin Whiting, former archivist of the Birmingham
Public Library. "But, oh gosh, we need to do so much more. We need,
both blacks and whites, to find the capacity to live together without
rancor and the negative elements that can be so tragic for society.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't deal with our wounds, I don't know what we will do.
Maybe this trial will help the healing process. I've never lost hope
that we can latch onto the lessons of history and go beyond our past,
but sometimes hope unfulfilled leaves a bad taste in your mouth, yet
you're afraid to let go of it."</TE>
<TE>   Leaving the courtroom where she'd been one of 150 spectators,
Rozina Collins, 31, a black, said her only emotion today was one of
happiness: "I believe the guilty verdict can help us heal. It will
take time. But I think we finally have a chance to be at peace with
our past in Birmingham."</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1871 as a steel and coal town, Birmingham grew so fast
as the South's first industrial city that it became known as "Magic
City." Birmingham, though, was really two cities, with two minor
league baseball teams: the (white) Barons and the Black Barons. In
1921, when President Warren G. Harding came to celebrate the city's
50th anniversary, he warned, "Let the black man vote if he is fit to
vote. And prevent the white man from voting if he is unfit to vote."</TE>
<TE>   By then, one of the most violent wings of the Ku Klux Klan had
become the enforcer of just-passed "Jim Crow" laws that would turn
Birmingham into America's most segregated major city. And by the time
Cherry and his band of Klansmen set out in 1963 to bomb the church
where civil rights activists, including the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr., planned much of their strategy, Alabama had elected Wallace
governor on a platform of "segregation forever" and Eugene "Bull"
Connor, the commissioner of public safety, had made Birmingham
synonymous with water hoses, police dogs and brutal oppression.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nothing we can take pride in and no one in their right mind
would say what happened was right," said Bob Adie, a white bartender.
"But that's how the Old South was back then and Bobby Frank Cherry is
a product of those times."</TE>
<TE>   The three-story, brick Baptist Church, founded in 1909, still
stands at the corner of 16th Street and 6th Avenue North, its scars
patched. On Sundays, songs from the congregation roll out into a
lovely park, the Place of Revolution and Reconciliation, across the
street and on weekdays the church is a major tourist attraction.</TE>
<TE>   "With the trial over, there is a sense that justice has finally
run its course after 39 years," said Lemarse Washington, one of the
church's trustees. "The verdict itself was almost secondary in
importance. What is more important in the process of healing is that
the trial has opened discussion about the past and made us think
about what Birmingham was and what it is."</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, blacks accounted for 47% of Birmingham's population and
owned 1% of its wealth. Today, the City Council, Board of Education
and major city agencies are predominantly black. But blacks control
5% of the wealth in Birmingham, though the city is now 75% black.
That, says Horace Huntley, director of Oral History at the Birmingham
Civil Rights Institute, underscores the need to address
bread-and-butter issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, we don't ride in the back of the bus anymore and we go into
City Hall as employees and employers, whereas before we only got in
carrying mops or brooms, but there are still many problems," said
Huntley, who bought a house in 1977 next to a white family, which put
up a "for sale" sign the next day.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, though, when you talk about race in Birmingham,
and the country as a whole, logic has a way of exiting. Our wounds
haven't healed because we've only used Band-Aids," Huntley said. "We
need to move to the next level of discussion. We need to improve the
image of Birmingham without forgetting the history that got us to
this juncture where we witness a trial for something of the magnitude
of what Bobby Frank Cherry did."</TE>
<TE>   Cherry, who did not testify in his defense, is the last suspect
brought to trial in the murder of Cynthia Wesley, Addie Mae Collins,
Carole Robertson and Denise McNair. Thomas Blanton Jr. was convicted
last year and is serving a life term. Robert "Dynamite Bob"
Chambliss, was found guilty in 1977 and died in prison. A fourth
suspect, Herman Cash, died in 1984 without being charged.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear what role Cherry, a man branded a racist by even
his defense attorney, played in the attack on the church. Some
witnesses said he lit the fuse, others that he made the bomb. Some of
the most damning testimony came from a man who, as an 11-year-old,
saw the four suspects at Cherry's kitchen table a few days before the
attack and heard the words "bomb" and "church."</TE>

<HD>Mosquitoes Losing Malarial Bite in Genetics Laboratory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT LEE HOTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As insecticides fail and vaccine efforts falter, scientists combating
malaria have created genetically engineered mosquitoes that do not
transmit the lethal disease, a feat hailed as a milestone in the
effort to conquer a pestilence that infects 300 million people every
year.</LD>
<LD>   Working with a strain of malaria in mice, researchers created a
gene in the hardy insect that normally spreads the malaria parasite,
turning it into a cleverly designed trap that one day could eradicate
a disease that kills as many people as AIDS and tuberculosis,
according to work made public Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   There are serious safety concerns and regulatory issues that must
be resolved before any of these experimental insects could be
released, experts said. There have been no approved releases into the
wild of genetically modified insects.</LD>
<TE>   But eventually, the researchers hope to transform the entire
species. Swarms of such modified mosquitoes could wipe out malaria by
transferring this gene to the entire population of malaria-carrying
mosquitoes, said Marcelo Jacobs-Lorena, a geneticist at Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland, who led the research team.</TE>
<TE>   This new breed of modified mosquitoes arises from a determined
effort to turn insects into the living tools of public health against
malaria, dengue and yellow fever, as more conventional pest controls
lose their effectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a significant achievement," said UC Irvine's Anthony
James, who pioneered the techniques for genetically altering
mosquitoes. "It is a clear demonstration that it is possible to make
this type of mosquito. This is a big milestone."</TE>
<TE>   The work, published today in the scientific journal Nature,
"represents a new era of malaria-related research," said Gareth J.
Lycett and Fotis C. Kafatos of the European Molecular Biology
Laboratory in Heidelberg, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Safety Questions</TE>
<TE>   The big question, said entomologist Peter Atkinson at UC
Riverside, is whether any manufactured insect can be safely released
into the wild--an issue that taps into public concerns about the
safety of genetically engineered organisms.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of problems--scientific and regulatory and
ethical--to solve," Jacobs-Lorena said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to be very careful before we move to release anything
into nature. We have to be sure genetically modified mosquitoes do
not acquire any other [harmful] properties. In principle, they should
not, but we need to do careful work to prove that."</TE>
<TE>   Not so long ago, malaria was all but eradicated in many parts of
the world, mostly through large-scale public sanitation efforts and
the use of prodigious amounts of insecticide. In an evolutionary arms
race, however, mosquitoes have grown immune to pesticides faster than
new ones can be found, while the malaria parasite has become immune
to most common medications. With global temperatures rising, the
insects may find themselves at home in areas that have never known
malaria.</TE>
<TE>   As the disease's resistance to drugs increases, malaria deaths
have soared to 3 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   In Africa, where 90% of all malaria cases occur, the disease
claims an African child every 30 seconds. In India, the government
spends almost half its health budget combating malaria.</TE>
<TE>   "Malaria is a reemerging disease," James said. "It is becoming a
problem again."</TE>
<TE>   The economics of malaria compound the difficulties. The disease is
resurging most strongly in the world's poorest countries, which offer
few commercial incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop new
treatments.</TE>
<TE>   Deaths Could Double</TE>
<TE>   Unless new control measures are found, the death toll is expected
to double in the next 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   By harnessing the power of molecular biology, researchers hope
that natural forces may take care of the problem as effectively and
economically as possible.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers made a new gene, called SM1, and used it to add a
molecule to the mosquito's makeup that stops the malaria parasite
from passing from the gut to the saliva of the mosquito. That keeps
the insect from infecting humans. The gene is activated when the
insect bites and sucks blood. It is passed to all offspring.</TE>
<TE>   The parasite simply can't get a grip on the mosquito's stomach,
throwing it off track at a critical point in its life cycle.</TE>
<TE>   In the research reported in Nature, two of three groups of
modified mosquitoes were unable to transmit the disease to mice, and
a third group of mosquitoes was only about 50% effective.</TE>
<TE>   Dyann Wirth, a Harvard University microbiologist and director of
the Harvard Malaria Initiative to battle the disease worldwide,
called it "a very fundamental scientific discovery" that offers a way
to attack malaria without using chemical pesticides such as DDT,
which can have harmful side effects.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs-Lorena did his experiments with a breed of mosquito called
Anopheles stephensi. The most important malarial carrier is a breed
called Anopheles gambiae, the type largely responsible for the
resurgence of the disease in Africa.</TE>
<TE>   His experiments were conducted with mice for safety reasons, but
its application to the mosquitoes that infect humans should be
straightforward technically, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The virulence of the malaria parasite, however, varies depending
upon the species it infects. Only a few kinds of mosquitoes transmit
malaria, while other mosquito breeds carry yellow fever or dengue.</TE>
<TE>   Bird Trials Successful</TE>
<TE>   What works in a mouse, therefore, may not be effective enough to
block transmission of the disease in humans, UC Irvine's James said.</TE>
<TE>   Using a different experimental technique in his laboratory, James
has genetically engineered mosquitoes that reduce transmission of the
disease among birds.</TE>
<TE>   By fall, researchers expect to have in hand the complete genetic
sequences of all three major players in the tragedy of malaria--the
genome sequence of the mosquito, the malaria parasite and the human
being.</TE>
<TE>   With those in hand, it then may be only a matter of time--no more
than a few years at most--before the creation of mosquitoes that can
block the parasite from infecting humans.</TE>
<TE>   "It is coming quite soon," Atkinson said. "Very soon now there
will be mosquitoes made in the laboratory that will be reduced in
their ability to transmit malaria to humans."</TE>

<HD>D.C. Sanctuary's Dark Past Goes Far Beyond Levy</HD>
<DH>Profile: Rock Creek Park's serenity hides the fact that
hers is not the first body found there.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE FIORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Rock Creek Park is a wilderness sanctuary in the middle of the
nation's capital, a natural preserve that defies the urban bustle
around it, a harborage for deer chased away by the din of the city.</LD>
<LD>   It is also one of the first places police thought to look last
year when former federal intern Chandra Levy was feared dead. And it
is there, in the park's lush serenity, that her remains surfaced
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The nearly 1,800-acre reserve--twice the size of New York's
Central Park--is a landmark with a sinister underside. A green haven
for city-dwellers, it is also a dark hiding place.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a known dumping ground for bodies," said Helen Morrison, a
forensic psychiatrist in Chicago, as detectives worked to identify
the human skull unearthed when a man walking his dog in a search for
turtles kicked aside some dirt. "That park was searched more than
once at the time Chandra Levy disappeared."</TE>
<TE>   Rock Creek is as central to this paved and marbled capital as
Griffith Park is to Los Angeles; a place where it is possible to
pretend you're someplace else.</TE>
<TE>   An urban jungle in the nicest sense, joggers run to the roar of
lions waking up at the National Zoo.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Reagan escaped there for horseback rides, a little bit of
his Santa Barbara ranch a stone's throw from the White House.</TE>
<TE>   At its rambling creek side, a city kid can be Tom Sawyer for the
day, courtesy of rangers known to produce a stick, a string and some
bait without ever being asked.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the Central Park of Washington," said Ainsley Perrien, a
mother of three who lives five minutes away and goes there several
times a week. "It is so big and so sparse that you see other people
but never feel overrun by them."</TE>
<TE>   The park sits in northwest Washington, home to the capital's
elite, but it serves as a diverse crossroads for every aspect of the
city. Senators and Cabinet members jog there; kids of all backgrounds
play there.</TE>
<TE>   This park belongs to the nation, established by Congress in 1890
"for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Officialdom had been looking for an alternative site for the White
House when the beautiful stretch of untouched land extending from
Georgetown to Maryland emerged as a candidate.</TE>
<TE>   The mansion was never relocated, but lawmakers were persuaded to
save the land, and just in time--Rock Creek was already being
polluted with raw sewage from nearby runaway growth.</TE>
<TE>   Today, it is a commuter path into the district on weekdays and a
safe place for in-line skaters on weekends as police close huge
stretches of road to traffic. It has possibly the highest density of
raccoons in the country and a healthy population of red and gray
foxes that people sometimes mistake for big cats, according to the
National Park Service.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Rock Creek's grim face the country glimpsed Wednesday
in the unfolding case of the missing intern whose relationship with
Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres) made her disappearance a global story.</TE>
<TE>   "Really, violent crimes are very rare here. It's a beautiful
park," said Sgt. Scott Fear, spokesman for the park police.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, crime has been part of Rock Creek's legacy for decades.
In 1937, the Washington Post editorialized for a restructured police
force to "stamp out the atrocities of perverts." The 1948 rape and
murder of an 11-year-old girl there shook the rafters in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   And this month, a man was sentenced to life in prison for the
torture and murder of a 48-year-old woman in broad daylight at the
park.</TE>
<TE>   Such crimes committed elsewhere do not always make news, but when
they happen within the leafy bounds of a local treasure, that's
something.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it is fitting that a man on a walk with his dog would have
found what police spent months searching for. The park is bisected by
a two-lane road with acres of woods on each side. You can't drive
around it; to really see it, you have to hike.</TE>
<TE>   "In Rock Creek Park itself you could be standing next to something
and not see it, as thick as the woods are here--and they are very,
very thick," Washington Metropolitan Police Chief Charles Ramsey
said.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, though, an early hunch by law enforcement proved
true as something majestic yielded something awful. And, at least for
a day, it was hard for those who came to escape the madness of
Washington to pretend they were anyplace else.</TE>

<HD>Discovery Shifts the Focus From Where to How</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Cause of death becomes the key element in trying
to solve the case, investigators say. The passage of time complicates
efforts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Finding the body, investigators say, is everything.</LD>
<LD>   With the positive identification Wednesday of the skeletal remains
of Chandra Levy, a stalled missing person case quickly became an
active death investigation.</LD>
<LD>   The task now at hand: finding the cause of death of the
24-year-old intern who disappeared with barely a trace more than a
year ago.</LD>
<TE>   "There is no question we still have a lot of work to do in
determining what exactly happened to Chandra Levy," said Channing
Phillips, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office here. "And if
it's determined it was by foul play, by whom?"</TE>
<TE>   But solving that puzzle--despite the body's decomposed state and
the long time it appears to have been exposed to the elements--became
exponentially more possible, experts say, now that criminal
investigators actually have a body.</TE>
<TE>   "The energy goes from looking for her to looking for who did it,"
said Christopher Evans, who was the Orange County prosecutor in the
murder case of Denise Huber, a Newport Beach woman whose bludgeoned
corpse was found in a freezer in Arizona three years after she
disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a challenge, but even in the most unusual of cases there
have been clues found," said Evans, who is now in private practice.
"There's fiber evidence, fingerprinting evidence, DNA evidence,
ballistic evidence, tool-mark pieces of evidence on bone that can be
isolated from animal markings, all of which can lead you back to the
original crime scene, or a slayer, or an accident."</TE>
<TE>   Washington police worked into the evening Wednesday setting up
lights in the isolated section of the city's sprawling Rock Creek
Park, where a man out walking his dog stumbled on Levy's remains
earlier in the day.</TE>
<TE>   The location, now considered a crime scene, is being guarded while
investigators meticulously comb the area, searching for clues that
might help them prosecute a killer, if it is determined Levy was
murdered.</TE>
<TE>   Clint Van Zandt, a former FBI agent who helped track down
convicted Unabomber Theodore J. Kaczynski, said that crime scene
technicians will sift the ground where the body was found "cupful by
cupful of soil."</TE>
<TE>   What they are looking for, he said, ranges from signs that a fight
took place to minute traces of evidence left in the deeply wooded
park.</TE>
<TE>   Van Zandt said that other details about the heavily wooded area
where the body was found also might help investigators come up with a
better picture of a suspect, if the medical examiner determines that
the cause of death was something other than an accident, suicide or
natural causes.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, investigators will be attempting to determine
whether the body was left in the open or if it was buried, and
whether she died where she was found or was moved there at a later
time.</TE>
<TE>   If it is determined that she was killed at or near where she was
found, investigators would ideally be able to find signs that she was
either lured there or happened upon the site, possibly while out
jogging or walking. There still may be signs that she put up a
struggle, despite the significant passage of time.</TE>
<TE>   But the fact that more than a year has passed since Levy's
disappearance complicates efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Van Zandt said investigators are likely considering several
possible scenarios, comparing the physical evidence to each possible
circumstance.</TE>
<TE>   "It could have been a totally unknown offender who knew that lone
women ran in the area. He's sitting there, sees her, picks up a
weapon of convenience, hits her in the head or chokes her," Van Zandt
said.</TE>
<TE>   However, the fact that her body was not easily found despite
extensive police searches of the area raises other questions, Van
Zandt said.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge of the random attacker theory," Van Zandt said, "is
that type of offender normally doesn't dig a grave or bother to hide
the body."</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of efforts to cover up a murder, Van Zandt said, is
usually an indication of an "organized offender," someone who to some
degree planned the crime and who is either a serial attacker or is
possibly someone who knew his or her victim.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery of articles of clothing and other items might help
law enforcement officials, who have continued to question potential
witnesses in the case in an attempt to better determine a timeline
leading up to Levy's disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   But it remains to be seen how much difficulty the medical examiner
will have in assigning a cause of death, experts said--a crucial
determination that will shape where the Levy case goes from here.</TE>
<TE>   If there are little more than bones and clothing remnants left at
this point, some veteran law enforcement officials cautioned
Wednesday that it might be impossible to conclude how Levy died. If
she was choked, for instance, there may be no traces of the attack
left to document.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington medical examiner was unable to determine a cause of
death in the case of Joyce Chiang, a 28-year-old lawyer who was
missing for three months before her body was found on the banks of
the Potomac River in northern Virginia in April 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The cases of Chiang and Levy, who both lived in the same Dupont
Circle neighborhood, have been compared by many in Washington,
including Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres), who has acknowledged a close
friendship with Levy. In a letter to constituents last year, he
suggested that the two women might be victims of the same serial
murderer.</TE>
<TE>   Experts are hopeful that Levy's remains will yield her cause of
death. Even without soft-tissue remains, forensic specialists said,
signs of blunt trauma--such as a knife wound or heavy object, or even
a gunshot wound to the skull or other bones--could still be apparent.</TE>
<TE>   If all else fails, said Dr. Philip J. Levine, chief dental
forensic expert for the medical examiner's office in Pensacola, Fla.,
and an authority on identifying human remains, investigators can turn
back to the teeth--the same source that allowed officials to
positively identify Levy in a matter of hours Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "When little else remains of a body, the teeth may still help us
determine if the person drowned," Levine said.</TE>
<TE>   "Recent chips might indicate a trauma to the mouth and, if they
aren't worn down from chewing, be evidence of an attack or fall close
to the time of death.</TE>
<TE>   "They begin putting things together and reaping the results--it's
absolutely astounding at times how much modern science can find out."</TE>

<HD>Store's Thongs for Kids Stir Outrage</HD>
<DH>Sales: Retailer says it will pull line, which critics
consider adult clothes shrunk to fit young girls.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co., an apparel retailer that is no stranger to
controversy, has sparked outrage again by selling thong underwear to
young girls.</LD>
<LD>   The American Family Assn. said Wednesday that it has been assured
by the retailer that it was pulling the underwear from its
Abercrombie stores, a chain for girls and boys ages 7 to 14.</LD>
<LD>   The company did not respond to calls seeking comment.</LD>
<TE>   Some underwear had the words "wink wink" and "eye candy" printed
on the front, said Don Wildmon, founder and executive director of the
Tupelo, Miss.-based association.</TE>
<TE>   "They were telling a 9-year-old that it's good for you to be a sex
object," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Companies increasingly are targeting young girls with trendier
clothes and makeup. Although most businesses insist their products
are appropriate for young customers, some parents and child advocacy
groups are distressed by what they consider adult clothes shrunk to
smaller sizes.</TE>
<TE>   Young girls are more interested in looking cool for their
girlfriends than in appearing alluring to boys, said Heather Johnston
Nicholson, research director for Girls Inc., a girls' advocacy group.
But apparel choices that are too grown-up can be misinterpreted, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Skimpy crop tops, all that stuff, have a tendency to focus on
sexiness at a younger age than most girls can manage," Nicholson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Abercrombie said it would pull the line from stores after
receiving as many as 120,000 e-mails from people who were furious
that the company would sell thong underwear to young girls, Wildmon
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they expected this reaction," he said. "I think
Abercrombie &amp; Fitch just blew this one."</TE>
<TE>   Wildmon's Christian-based association was alerted to the thong
sales by OneMillionMoms.com and OneMillionDads.com, Internet child
advocacy groups that are a special project of the association. The
project released a "call for action" Tuesday morning and was told by
Abercrombie early Wednesday that it would halt the sales, Wildmon
said.</TE>
<TE>   Abercrombie has a knack for stirring strong--and often
angry--feelings among consumers. Last month, the New Albany,
Ohio-based retailer sparked an uproar from college students who said
a line of its T-shirts depicted racist caricatures of Asian
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The shirts showed cartoonish Asian characters with slanted eyes
and conical hats. Abercrombie apologized, saying it meant no offense
and that it would immediately pull the shirts.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, a judge declared a mistrial in a damages suit brought
by seven professional surfers against Abercrombie over the retailer's
use of their photograph in a catalog amid shots of apparently nude
male models. The surfers said their names and likenesses were used
without their knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   A&amp;F Quarterly, part magazine and part catalog, regularly ignites
controversy with its racy images.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Black, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, said the
controversy probably won't have a significant effect on sales.</TE>
<TE>   "I think these types of things that are happening are immaterial
as far as the earnings of the company," she said.</TE>

<HD>Terror Warnings Offer Cautionary Tale</HD>
<DH>Security: Four top officials have said attacks are
inevitable. The resulting storm shows how little consensus there is
on disclosure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Deciding how much to disclose about potential terrorist threats is
proving almost as difficult for the Bush administration as obtaining
the information in the first place.</LD>
<LD>   Just days after the White House faced accusations of mishandling
clues before Sept. 11, it confronts new questions about whether
officials are now frightening and confusing the public with too many
warnings.</LD>
<LD>   Since Sunday, four top officials have declared that various forms
of terrorist attacks are inevitable. Meanwhile, the FBI in recent
days issued two warnings against more specific targets: apartment
buildings and landmarks in New York City.</LD>
<TE>   Some critics fear the generalized warnings are obscuring the more
specific alerts and numbing the public. Others question whether the
administration is trying to change the subject from the criticism of
its pre-Sept. 11 performance, a contention senior officials
emphatically deny.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Wednesday on CNN's ''Larry King Live,'' Vice
President Dick Cheney said: ''The fact is there is reason to believe
that the threat level has increased somewhat.... We haven't changed
our practices at all in terms of when we decide to go public and
caution people.''</TE>
<TE>   Still, this new swarm of alerts suggests the political pressure
now clearly tilts toward greater disclosure of potential threats.
Politically, analysts in both parties agree, the risk of saying too
little now appears much greater than the risk of saying too much.</TE>
<TE>   But the controversy surrounding the latest sequence of warnings
suggests how far officials remain from a consensus on when and how to
raise a red flag in an environment transformed by Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to strike a balance between keeping people informed
and not scaring them to death," said Andy Kohut, director of the Pew
Research Center for the People and the Press, a nonpartisan polling
group. "But in all fairness to the administration, who knows what
that balance is? We are in uncharted waters."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, since Sept. 11, officials at all levels of government have
been alternately criticized for releasing too much or too little
information.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, California Gov. Gray Davis was ridiculed by some for
publicizing warnings of potential threats to California bridges that
the FBI later said were uncorroborated. Around the same time, critics
charged the Bush administration was desensitizing the public with
overly broad warnings and open-ended calls for Americans to remain on
highest alert.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the wheel has turned and the administration has
faced its sharpest post-Sept. 11 questioning over charges the FBI and
CIA failed to act aggressively enough last summer on information that
might have offered clues to the terrorist plot. Those questions
reached an apex last week with the revelation that the CIA had
briefed Bush last August on the possibility of hijackings as a future
Al Qaeda tactic.</TE>
<TE>   While Bush's overall approval rating has not declined, several
polls have found that substantial numbers of Americans now wonder
whether officials did all they could to prevent the attacks. In an
ABC/Washington Post survey last week, Americans split evenly on
whether the administration followed up aggressively enough on the
intelligence reports.</TE>
<TE>   The flurry of new terror warnings emerged against that highly
charged backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   The drumbeat began on Sunday with newspaper reports in which
unnamed administration officials said they had intercepted an
increasing level of communication among Al Qaeda operatives that
could hint at a new attack.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Sunday, Vice President Dick Cheney, appearing on NBC's
"Meet the Press," said future attacks were "not a matter of if, but
when."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III told a conference of
district attorneys that he considered it "inevitable" the United
States would be targeted by suicide bombers. On Tuesday, Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told a congressional panel he believed
terrorists "inevitably" will acquire weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Also since Sunday, Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge has issued
similar warnings about the risk of future attack--even as the FBI
transmitted its alerts to local officials on apartment buildings and
New York City monuments.</TE>
<TE>   All of these ringing alarms have raised intertwined political and
policy questions.</TE>
<TE>   On the political front, some Democrats flatly accuse the
administration of seeking to shift attention from the debate over its
performance before Sept. 11. "It simply is not coincidental they have
their first public relations debacle since [the attacks] ... and the
first person they send out, Dick Cheney, says we are all going to die
soon," charged Jim Jordan, executive director of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee. "You wonder what state of national
alert we will be in in October" just before this year's election.</TE>
<TE>   Bush officials forcefully deny they are attempting to change the
subject. White House Communications Director Dan Bartlett--noting
that Cheney, Rumsfeld and Mueller all made their remarks in response
to questions--said it was a "coincidence" that the senior officials
made their comments while the FBI was issuing more specific alerts.</TE>
<TE>   On the policy front, some analysts worry that the broad warnings,
which don't call for Americans to take any specific actions, are
unnecessarily raising anxieties and drowning out the more targeted
alerts, where greater public vigilance could be helpful. "The real
danger is with all this chatter of general alerts, the specific ones
are being lost," said Ivo Daalder, a former Clinton administration
National Security Council official now at the nonpartisan Brookings
Institution think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say it is important, in such an unconventional
conflict, for leaders to build support for sustained action at home
and abroad by regularly reminding Americans of the ongoing threat.
"Whatever other reasons exist [for the spate of warnings], it does
serve as a salutary reminder to the American public that this is a
very long war," said Bruce Hoffman, Rand Corp. Washington office
director.</TE>
<TE>   There's no indication Americans resent the repeated warnings; in a
CBS poll this week, 71% of adults said issuing the alerts, even
without specific details, was a good idea. But neither is it clear
Americans are responding to them in any systematic way, either by
changing their behavior or heightening their personal vigilance.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure how we would even change our behavior ... when we
don't know what is going to come," said Karlyn Bowman, an expert on
public opinion at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is it clear the latest warnings will much change the basic
political equation for the administration. Gary J. Schmitt, executive
director of the conservative Project for a New American Century think
tank, said that for most Americans, performance is likely to count
far more than prediction. "The truth is if something really does
happen, all of these warnings will not really protect anybody from
charges of incompetence," he said. "If there is another major
terrorist attack, there is no doubt there will be a lot of
recriminations, regardless of whether they put out warnings or not."</TE>

<HD>Life on Jupiter Moon Likely on Thin (or Thick) Ice</HD>
<DH>Science: Europa's ocean is seen as the best bet for
extraterrestrials. But now it appears they could be 12 miles deep,
complicating the study.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The vast ocean on Jupiter's moon Europa--considered one of the best
hopes for extraterrestrial life in our solar system--may be capped by
12 or more miles of ice, suggesting any life forms that exist
underneath could be far stranger and much harder to find than
previously believed.</LD>
<LD>   By analyzing the deformation of impact craters and the chaotic
patterns on the moon's icy surface, scientists finally are settling a
long-raging debate about just how thick or thin the ice crust is--and
what kind of life it could support. Thick is winning.</LD>
<LD>   "This clearly has implications for how organisms might develop and
evolve, and how we might land and search for them," said Paul M.
Schenk, a geologist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston
whose findings are published in today's issue of the journal Nature.</LD>
<TE>   "In a thin shell, you have photosynthetic organisms possibly
brewing in the stew," Schenk said. "In the thick shell, you don't
have that option."</TE>
<TE>   Europa is a top target of astrobiologists because it is thought to
contain three things necessary for life to evolve: a source of heat,
organic material and liquid water in an ocean capped by ice.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, though, a "thick versus thin" debate has raged
about whether that ocean is topped by a thin layer of ice that can
crack or melt to let sunlight and oxygen reach organisms or is
cloaked by a thick, impenetrable sheet of ice that would make the
creation and survival of life more challenging.</TE>
<TE>   The newest findings from Schenk show that large meteor craters on
Europa do not leave deep pits or raised rims, as they do in harder
surfaces. Instead, they leave a flat area and a series of concentric
rings on the surface, suggesting that a hole is created in a soft icy
area and filled in with ice from below.</TE>
<TE>   Computer analysis of the deformations indicates the hard and soft
ice layers must be at least 12 miles thick to produce the distinctive
bull's-eye patterns on Europa.</TE>
<TE>   The new analysis builds on the work of planetary scientists Robert
Pappalardo, Louise Prockter and James Head III, who have spent years
trying to make sense of Europa's chaotic surface. The fractured ice
is crisscrossed by ridges and bands and pocked by pits, domes and
chunky icebergs.</TE>
<TE>   Between these features are gaps that appear to be filled in by
newly formed ice and areas that are much redder and darker than the
surrounding ice. Adding to the mystery, the surface is relatively
free of craters, suggesting that some process--a kind of geological
Zamboni machine--is continually resurfacing the ice.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists at first speculated that the turbulent features could
be caused by a thin layer of ice atop an ocean. But more recent work
suggests that the oddities do not require liquid so near the surface.
Instead, Pappalardo said, they are likely to be the product of a
thick two-part ice layer.</TE>
<TE>   On top is a five-mile-thick layer of brittle ice several hundred
degrees below zero. Underneath is a seven-mile-thick layer of warmer,
slushy ice. Scientists think this warmer ice is capable of flowing,
as glaciers do. They also think blobs of warmer ice rise upward
through the colder surface ice, through convection, causing the
strange surface scars.</TE>
<TE>   "The surface seems to cry out that this convection is happening,"
said Pappalardo, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado.
"It essentially acts as a lava lamp."</TE>
<TE>   The thick ice also fits with models created by Dave Stevenson, a
planetary scientist at Caltech. A decade ago, Stevenson proposed that
Europa is heated by tidal flexing--a squeezing and relaxing of the
entire moon caused by the gravitational pull of Jupiter and its other
large moons. The internal friction caused by this squeezing creates
heat, "just like rubbing your hands together makes them warm,"
Stevenson said.</TE>
<TE>   Because many astrobiologists have thought that an ocean open to
sunlight and the atmosphere is a more likely place for life, some
scientists have leaned toward a controversial proposal by University
of Arizona planetary scientist Richard Greenberg, suggesting the
icecap is a mere mile or two thick.</TE>
<TE>   A majority of scientists is critical of that idea as more
emotional than scientific. "We can't let our desires for how Europa
should act influence our science," Pappalardo said. A thin cap is
unlikely, Stevenson said, because there doesn't seem to be enough
heat on the moon to cause that much melting.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way this question of ice thickness will be resolved is
with another mission," said Ronald Greeley, a planetary scientist at
Arizona State University who led a 1999 National Academy of Sciences
panel about how best to explore Europa. Measuring its "tidal
bulges"--how much it deforms under the pull of Jupiter's
gravity--could yield an answer. A thin ice layer would deform much
more.</TE>
<TE>   Studying the frozen world remains a high priority because of
NASA's "follow the water" approach to seeking extraterrestrial life.
The combination of ice and ocean that surrounds Europa's rocky core
is estimated to be between 60 miles and 120 miles thick, and contains
twice the water of all of Earth's oceans. "There's a lot of juice
there," Greeley said.</TE>
<TE>   While it is easy to imagine ways that life could exist if ocean
water was exposed to the atmosphere in cracks or melt holes,
scientists said it is unlikely that cracks can penetrate from the
surface through 12 miles or more of ice cap. Life is not likely to
exist on the surface of Europa ice because of the ferocious radiation
that pelts the moon, although it could exist in cracks and pores
within the ice.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Chyba, who holds the Carl Sagan chair for the study of
life in the universe at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif.,
is among those who think life may exist in Europa's ocean.</TE>
<TE>   He believes organisms under the ice cap could exist without
sunlight. They could obtain chemical energy, oxidants and other raw
ingredients of life from the surface as the ice circulates. "Thin ice
is not critical to the possibility of life of Europa," Chyba said.</TE>
<TE>   This spring, NASA canceled plans to send an orbiter to Europa
because of cost overruns. A fat layer of ice also means that a JPL
proposal to drill or melt through the icecap with robots and then
explore the ocean below with submarines isn't likely anytime soon.</TE>
<TE>   But planetary scientists still hope to eventually get to the
distant moon--thick ice or not.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a phenomenal place to have in our backyard," said Rich
Terrile, who was the lead JPL scientist on the canceled mission.
"It's got all the elements that just cry out for exploration."</TE>

<KH>THE  SECESSION DEBATE</KH>
<HD>Hahn Says a Breakup Wouldn't Pay Off for Either L.A. or
Valley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Picking up his campaign to keep Los Angeles whole even as a state
commission approved a ballot measure that would break it apart, Mayor
James K. Hahn said Wednesday that a separate Valley city would be
costly for all residents and would not result in the small-town
atmosphere that secession backers are seeking.</LD>
<LD>   "Remember, we're talking about a city that is the Phoenix,
Philadelphia size," said Hahn, referring to the 1.3 million people
who live in what would be a separate Valley city. "We're not talking
about Mayberry here."</LD>
<LD>   Hahn's lunchtime speech to the local chapter of the American
Jewish Committee came as the Local Area Formation Commission
deliberated whether to put Valley cityhood on the ballot. Hours
later, the commission voted to place that measure on the November
ballot over the objections of Hahn, who asked the panel to delay its
vote until the matter could be studied more extensively.</LD>
<TE>   The mayor formed a campaign committee in November to defeat
secession, and he has identified that effort as his top priority. In
addition to its implications for Los Angeles, secession also contains
personal risks for Hahn, putting him in the position of being the
mayor under whom the nation's second-largest city is broken up.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, he discussed the topic on the monthly "Ask the
Mayor" radio call-in show and then made it the centerpiece of his
lunchtime address. In that speech, Hahn asked the 200 people
assembled in a dining room of the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel to
join his effort to combat secession, a request that drew strong
applause.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he sees it as one of the true challenges to his term as
mayor, and my sense is that he is rising to the occasion," said Rabbi
Gary Greenebaum, Western regional director of the American Jewish
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   During his 30-minute address, Hahn laid out a wide-ranging
argument against secession, appealing both to residents' pride in the
city and to their apprehension about what the split could mean.</TE>
<TE>   As he often does in speeches, Hahn cited improvements he has made
to city services since taking office in July, but he spent the bulk
of his speech ticking off problems he said would ensue under
secession. Taxes in the new area would probably increase, Hahn said,
and some services could be cut. The Valley, according to Hahn, would
be less well-equipped than it is today to handle major emergencies,
and would not, at least initially, have rent control or neighborhood
councils, two popular city programs.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn also warned that the breakup could damage the rest of the
city as well by stripping away part of its tax base and encouraging
other communities to explore leaving.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll see a movement that will begin to destroy everything that
Los Angeles has been over the years," the mayor said. Secession
advocates objected to Hahn's tack, saying that he was misleading
people about the financial health of a Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   "He offers no options and no alternatives," said Richard Close,
chairman of the pro-secession group Valley VOTE. "Instead of coming
up with positive reasons for people to vote no, he instead relies on
scare tactics."</TE>

<HD>House Sweeps Through Bioterrorism Bill</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Measure would provide local agencies with
medicine and training, add protection to the water and food supplies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House, citing new terrorist threats, overwhelmingly passed a bill
Wednesday to help state and local governments, hospitals, health-care
workers, disease researchers, water utilities and food inspectors
prepare for and defend against bioterrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Reflecting lawmakers' strong desire to show a united political
front against terrorism, the 425-1 vote came less than a day after
House and Senate conferees agreed on a compromise version of the
legislation. The Senate could vote on the measure as soon as today,
and President Bush is expected to sign it upon his return from
Europe.</LD>
<LD>   Noting that "America is again on heightened alert," Rep. W.J.
"Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), co-sponsor of the House bill, said it would
make "broad and dramatic investments in our public-health
infrastructure to ensure the safety and security of the American
people."</LD>
<TE>   Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), co-sponsor of the Senate version, said
the country faces a "risk that is higher than it was a year ago."
While "our vulnerabilities are large," he said, they are reduced by
the provisions of the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers in both houses began working on anti-terrorism
legislation soon after the Sept. 11 attacks. Then the anthrax scare
of last fall, in which anthrax-tainted letters caused the deaths of
five people and injured at least 13 others, prompted lawmakers to
focus on bioterrorism preparedness.</TE>
<TE>   The House and Senate passed slightly different versions of the
legislation late last fall.</TE>
<TE>   The compromise version, when combined with funds already approved
for this fiscal year, lifts the total anti-bioterrorism authorization
for this year and next to more than $4.6 billion. The exact amount
that will actually be spent will be decided in appropriation bills.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said some of the bill's provisions
would protect Americans not only against bioterrorism attacks but
also against more "day-to-day" dangers such as contaminated food and
medications with life-threatening side effects.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the legislation extends a 1992 law that requires
pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay fees to the Food and Drug
Administration. The agency uses the money to hire additional
researchers and speed up the review process needed before new drugs
can come to market. The bill specifically targets generic drugs,
which are much less expensive than name brands, for quicker review,
sponsors said.</TE>
<TE>   Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson said the FDA
and the Agriculture Department would gain hundreds of new inspectors
trained to detect spoiled food and protect crops and livestock from
biological or chemical sabotage.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also imposes new safety and security requirements on
laboratories and individuals who handle the 36 most dangerous
biological agents and toxins and sets up a national database to keep
track of where they are.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the bill represents "the largest investment in public
health in our history," Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the bill authorizes:</TE>
<TE>   *$1.5 billion in grants to state and local governments, hospitals
and local health agencies to use in planning for emergencies,
training health-care personnel to recognize illnesses caused by
deadly biological or chemical agents and preparing to handle the
large number of patients who could be killed or injured in a
bioterrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   *Almost $1.2 billion to expand the nation's stockpile of vaccines
to prevent infection from the dispersal of deadly substances such as
the smallpox virus, and drugs to treat related illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   *$545 million to improve the safety of the nation's food supply.</TE>
<TE>   *More than $100 million to improve security at all community water
systems that serve more than 3,300 people.</TE>
<TE>   The bill requires drinking-water utilities to conduct
"vulnerability assessments" of their plants and to report findings to
the Environmental Protection Agency. Tauzin said the report summaries
would be well secured by the agency and would not "end up on the
Internet." After Sept. 11, authorities found layouts of many
utilities available online.</TE>
<TE>   But Tom Curtis, a spokesman for the American Water Works Assn.,
said he was worried that the reports could still end up in the wrong
hands. They are basically "a blueprint on how to attack a water
utility," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, some water utilities may have to seek rate hikes if
the federal government doesn't provide more funds for the
assessments, Curtis said.</TE>
<TE>   The lone no vote on the House was cast by Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas).</TE>

<HD>Anti-Terrorism Funding Measure Gains in House</HD>
<DH>Politics: Lawmakers smooth path to give the president an
extra $29 billion. Passage is expected today for bill, which will
also aid textile industry, some hospitals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House on Wednesday cleared the way for approval of an additional
$29 billion for President Bush's anti-terrorism efforts and the
military operation in Afghanistan, the latest example of Congress'
willingness to open its wallet to respond to the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The emergency spending bill cleared its biggest hurdle when
Republican leaders thwarted an insurrection over provisions they
added to it that have nothing to do with combating terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   These included trade concessions to the textile industry and
Medicare payment hikes for a handful of hospitals.</LD>
<TE>   A final vote on the measure was expected today.</TE>
<TE>   There was little dispute about the core provisions of the bill to
hike defense and homeland security spending. Indeed, it provided
almost $2 billion more than Bush requested. There was also wide
support for provisions to give $200 million in additional aid to
Israel and $50 million to the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   But GOP leaders had to scramble for enough votes to keep the bill
on track because their party was divided over the broad question of
how to constrain spending at a time when money seems to be no object.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute pitted fiscal conservatives, who inserted in the
measure a government-wide cap on spending, against powerful GOP
members of the Appropriations Committee, who threatened to vote to
block the bill from coming to the floor because the cap would
undercut their power.</TE>
<TE>   But after hours of arm-twisting, GOP leaders brought
Appropriations Committee members into line and won the vote to bring
up the bill, 216 to 209.</TE>
<TE>   The bill was expected to win final passage by a wider margin.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a
$31-billion version of the bill that also would inject Congress more
deeply into oversight of homeland security policy.</TE>
<TE>   The measure includes provisions that would require Bush's director
of homeland security, Tom Ridge, to be confirmed by the Senate. The
job was created by Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks without the
confirmation requirement.</TE>
<TE>   The House version of the appropriations bill includes about $16
billion for the Pentagon and $5.8 billion for increased security
efforts in such areas as transportation, the Coast Guard and law
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's Office of Management and Budget balked at an earlier, more
expensive House bill.</TE>
<TE>   But after the House Appropriations Committee scaled back some of
its proposed add-ons and offset others with spending cuts, OMB
officials endorsed the measure. But they said they would vigorously
oppose the Senate effort to increase its total.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill still aggravated some of the House's fiscal
conservatives, who feared it would set a bad precedent for the raft
of spending bills for the next budget year to go beyond the
president's request.</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives are particularly concerned about the potential for
significantly increased spending because Congress is not expected to
adopt a budget resolution for the 2003 fiscal year--the blueprint
that usually sets limits to annual appropriations.</TE>
<TE>   To appease those concerns, GOP leaders added a provision to the
current bill that would set an overall spending ceiling of $749
billion, in lieu of a budget resolution.</TE>
<TE>   That prompted the protest by the Appropriations Committee members,
who viewed the cap as too low.</TE>
<TE>   Committee members also objected to last-minute decisions by the
leadership to insert special-interest provisions into the bill; the
panel had tried to keep such projects out of it.</TE>
<TE>   Among these additions was a provision GOP leaders had promised to
textile-state Republicans in order to win their votes last December
on legislation to expand the president's trade-negotiating powers.</TE>
<TE>   The provision would require that apparel made in Caribbean Basin
countries include fabric dyed or finished in the United States to
qualify for quota-free treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The provision was sought by Rep. James DeMint (R-S.C.), who is
facing a tough reelection fight.</TE>
<TE>   GOP leaders also added a provision that would boost Medicare
payments to three specified regions, all represented by Republicans
in the House.</TE>
<TE>   The last-minute change that most angered Democrats was a
non-binding provision promising that Congress would raise the
statutory limit on federal borrowing.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has asked Congress to raise the debt
limit, but Republican leaders say they don't have the votes to enact
such politically sensitive legislation.</TE>
<TE>   To sidestep a direct vote on the issue, congressional leaders plan
to slip a debt-ceiling increase into the spending bill when a
House-Senate conference committee agrees on its final version.</TE>
<TE>   The non-binding language approved by the House lays the groundwork
for that maneuver.</TE>
<TE>   Democats say GOP leaders are shirking their fiscal
responsibilities in order to protect their rank-and-file from the
politically perilous vote to increase government debt.</TE>
<TE>   "They are attempting to shield their weak-kneed members from
having to vote to put us deep in debt," said Rep. Martin Frost
(D-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   Republicans emphasized that the bill was a "wartime" spending
measure that is needed more than ever, in light of recent terrorism
alerts.</TE>
<TE>   "The alerts and warnings we receive are a constant reminder that
the war on terrorism is far from over," said Rep. Pete Sessions
(R-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   In related action to combat terrorism, the House earlier Wednesday
approved a bill that would authorize additional funding for the U.S.
Customs Service to improve computer systems and other special
equipment aimed at intercepting terrorists and illegal drugs at the
nation's borders and seaports.</TE>

<HD>Arrest in Ala. Dog Deaths</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LILLIAN, Ala.</DL>
<LD>A former Florida dog track security guard was charged with animal
cruelty Wednesday after the remains of as many as 3,000 greyhounds
were found on his property.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Rhodes, 68, said he profited for more than 40 years by
killing injured or aging dogs with a gunshot to the head at the
request of racing dog owners, but is no longer in the business.</LD>
<LD>   Florida officials were investigating allegations that dogs from
Pensacola Greyhound Park, where Rhodes used to work, were improperly
destroyed.</LD>
<TE>   Rhodes said before his arrest that he sometimes received $10 for
shooting a dog and that he believes track officials had turned him
in.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't condone cruelty to animals in any way," Rhodes said.
David Whetstone, Baldwin County district attorney, said autopsies of
four dogs found that only one had been shot cleanly through the
brain. The others received wounds through the neck and elsewhere,
indicating they suffered before dying, he said.</TE>
<TE>   State officials obtained a warrant Tuesday to search Rhodes' 18
acres of coastal property in Lillian after receiving a tip and
looking at satellite images that showed animal bones strewn about the
property.</TE>

<KH>THE CHANDRA LEVY CASE</KH>
<HD>In Levy's Modesto Hometown, Hope Dissolves Into Anguish</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK ARAX and DON A. WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>MODESTO</DL>
<LD>For more than a year they waited, hanging yellow ribbons up and down
Chenault Street, neighbors making weekly visits to the Levy front
door in the middle of the block with home-baked turkeys, cakes and
pies.</LD>
<LD>   Early Wednesday, Joanne Tittle answered a knock on her door and
found Robert Levy, her good friend, neighbor and the father of
missing federal intern Chandra Levy. He was shaking and crying.</LD>
<LD>   "Bob said they found a body. 'I'm afraid it's Chandra,' he said.
He was very shaken up and crying."</LD>
<TE>   "I thought they had searched that park long ago," Tittle said.
"How could they miss her? How could it take a year?"</TE>
<TE>   The long wait was over and the crush of media had returned to the
quiet block of upscale houses in a subdivision called Golden Estate
Acres. Here on the outskirts of Modesto, in a neighborhood skirted by
fruit orchards and nut groves where horses are hitched out back, the
Levy family sat in seclusion trying to absorb the news they always
feared would come.</TE>
<TE>   Deidre Wolfley, who has lived 20 years on the block, said it is
better to know Chandra's fate than to live in an endless state of
uncertainty. "Maybe now there can be some closure, not only for the
family but this neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   The mystery of the 5-foot-3, 110-pound student with a mop of black
curly hair has kept this neighborhood on vigil since May 1 of last
year. Even as they feared the worst, neighbors worked to bolster the
spirits of the Levys--beloved oncologist Robert, 55, wife Susan, 54,
and son Adam, 20.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very sad," said neighbor Jamie Cruz, 18, who recalls
Susan Levy helping her with a skinned knee when she was a child.
"Before, when I'd see a crime story on television I'd feel for the
victim, but it was still someone I didn't know. Now it hits home,
very personally."</TE>
<TE>   Modesto Mayor Carmen Sabatino ordered city flags flown at
half-staff.</TE>
<TE>   "In the context of tragedies occurring all over the world,"
Sabatino said, "this may seem relatively insignificant, except it's
been tragic for two families in our community, the Levys and the
Condits, and the community is more sensitive."</TE>
<TE>   Levy's relationship with local congressman Gary A. Condit
(D-Ceres) turned her disappearance into tabloid news, as
investigators kept questioning him even though he denied knowing
anything about her disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's been a year now since she vanished, but that hasn't changed
what people think about Condit,'' said John Adams, a retired Modesto
marketing manager. ''The way he handled everything, I don't know if
he did it or not, but he sure looked suspicious. I just hope they
find whoever's guilty.''</TE>
<TE>   Billie Gilmore, 66, a retired bank worker, said most folks felt
that Chandra was dead because ''she was a good girl. She wouldn't
have stayed away from her family this long without any word.''</TE>
<TE>   But as the community grieves, Gilmore said the body's discovery
will not necessarily mean renewed finger-pointing at Condit. ''Deep
down, I don't feel he did it,'' she said. ''Sure, he was messing
around with her, but he didn't kill her.''</TE>
<TE>   Angie Smith, a mother of two daughters in their 20s, said the
discovery of Levy's body is particularly tough on Modesto parents,
even those who don't know the family.</TE>
<TE>   ''I have two daughters, and I couldn't imagine not knowing if
something ever happened to one of them. It would destroy me,'' she
said. ''I think everyone in the country feels bad about this. I went
to my daughters' college graduation and I feel terrible that the
Levys never got that chance with their daughter. It's a national
tragedy.''</TE>
<TE>   Back on Chenault Street, neighbors talked of how the Levys--before
their daughter's disappearance--were always there to help.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Levy had spent a lot of time working with residents and
sheriff's deputies organizing the Neighborhood Watch. She also served
as the community conscience, neighbors said, collecting money for
earthquake victims in South America and other causes. Robert Levy
devoted long hours to saving the lives of cancer patients.</TE>
<TE>   Here in the middle of California's sweeping farm belt, a world
away from the streets of Washington where the 24-year-old Levy
vanished, the Levys watched their daughter grow into a young woman
with promise.</TE>
<TE>   She had come a long way from the little girl who spent so much of
her youth locked in her bedroom poring over statistics of her
favorite baseball team, the San Francisco Giants, and dreaming of the
day when she might cover them as a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   ''Look out sports world, here I come. I cannot wait to write about
you,'' she vowed in the back of her high school yearbook in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Six years later, as she boarded the plane to Washington for a
final semester of graduate work in government studies, there was
nothing wide-eyed or naive about her.</TE>
<TE>   She had traveled the world with her daring parents, from the
ghettos of Jamaica to the black markets of the Middle East. They
Levys had taught Chandra to trust her gut.</TE>
<TE>   The young woman who later set her sights on becoming an FBI agent
was a born cop, family and friends say. She had a sixth sense for
danger and how best to avert it.</TE>
<TE>   ''She was a cool cookie, very sophisticated, very directed and
very strong," neighbor Tittle said recently. ''She wasn't someone who
trusted strangers and she wasn't easily led into danger.''</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Bettina Boxall and John M. Glionna contributed
to this report.</TE>

<HD>Worldly Wise Boy Wins Competition</HD>
<DH>Learning: Instant replay helps 10-year-old to outduel older
youngsters in geography bee.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>It took an instant replay to settle a disputed call in the National
Geographic Bee, then the youngest contestant, 10-year-old Calvin
McCarter of Jenison, Mich., emerged the winner</LD>
<LD>   McCarter, standing just 4 feet, 6 inches in a room full of bigger
youngsters, many of them teen-agers, claimed victory Wednesday by
correctly identifying China as the location of the Lop Nur nuclear
test site.</LD>
<LD>   It'll be a few years before he can use the main prize--a $25,000
college scholarship. He also won a lifetime subscription to National
Geographic magazine.</LD>
<TE>   McCarter is taught at home by his mother, Charlotte. His father,
Parnell McCarter, an accountant, said the family decided on home
schooling to have their children receive a Christian education "in an
atmosphere where there is a love of learning."</TE>
<TE>   Young McCarter said he prefers being home-schooled because he gets
more personal attention. In public school, he said, "you can't make
children listen."</TE>
<TE>   It was touch-and-go for a while Wednesday when a questioned call
threatened to eliminate the fifth-grader.</TE>
<TE>   The tense moments came when the last three contestants were
battling for the two championship slots.</TE>
<TE>   McCarter missed the name of warm, dry mountain winds in Europe. He
said mistral, but the correct answer was foehn.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Russell of Bradford, Pa., correctly named Estonia as the
country which claims the islands of Muhu, Hiiumaa and Saaremaa.</TE>
<TE>   Then Erik Miller of Kent, Wash., was asked to name the country
where shadow puppet shows called wayang are common. He correctly
answered Indonesia, seemingly just as the time buzzer rang.</TE>
<TE>   Host Alex Trebek ruled that the answer came too late, but judges
in the audience said it was in time.</TE>
<TE>   The decision was crucial because a correct answer by Miller would
have eliminated McCarter.</TE>
<TE>   Trebek sent the judges to the broadcast truck to view the replay
and when they returned they reversed themselves and agreed with
Trebek, the answer was too late.</TE>
<TE>   That meant that McCarter and Miller had to compete against each
other to face Russell in the finals. McCarter won by knowing that the
Kamchatka Peninsula separates the Bering Sea from the Sea of Okhotsk.</TE>
<TE>   Then it was McCarter against Russell for the title, and the
diminutive McCarter prevailed.</TE>

<HD>Hormone May Be Weight Loss Key</HD>
<DH>Health: Ghrelin, found in the stomach, rises before a meal,
though not in people who have had bypasses. Lowering level is
possible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>A hormone released by the stomach and upper intestine may be the key
to helping overweight people shed extra pounds and keep them off,
according to a study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.</LD>
<LD>   "If this approach works, then it might be something we could use
even for people who are only modestly overweight," said Dr. David
Cummings of the University of Washington in Seattle, chief author of
the new study.</LD>
<LD>   If controlling the hormone was found to be an effective treatment
for obesity, it could help fight a worrying rise in overweight people
in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   A study published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical
Assn. found that 1 in 5 Americans was overweight in 2000, up from
just over 1 in 10 a decade earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Some data indicate obesity now outranks smoking as a cause of
disease and death, adding millions of dollars to the nation's
health-care costs.</TE>
<TE>   In tests on 33 volunteers, the researchers found that, in most
people, the levels of the hormone ghrelin rose before each meal and
dropped after each meal.</TE>
<TE>   But the five people who had undergone surgery to have food bypass
their stomach turned out to be the significant exception. In those
cases, ghrelin levels never rose or fell; remaining at nearly
undetectable levels.</TE>
<TE>   Because earlier research had shown that the hormone appears to be
a key factor in controlling a person's compulsion to eat, the
researchers said the low levels of ghrelin seen in stomach bypass
patients may account for their ability to lose lots of weight and,
more important, keep it off.</TE>
<TE>   "Suppression of ghrelin can now be studied as a potential
mechanism by which (stomach bypass surgery) causes weight loss," said
Cummings and his colleagues in the research.</TE>
<TE>   People trying to stay on a diet had the highest ghrelin levels,
which may explain why people who lose weight typically have a hard
time keeping it off.</TE>
<TE>   The results are "suggesting that ghrelin might contribute to the
drive to eat that makes long-term success with dieting so rare," said
Drs. Jeffrey S. Flier of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and
Eleftheria Maratos-Flier of the Joslin Diabetes Center, both in
Boston, in a Journal editorial.</TE>
<TE>   "These data suggest that ghrelin antagonists may someday be
considered in the treatment of obesity," the researchers concluded.</TE>
<TE>   But the Fliers cautioned that further studies are needed to see if
treatment with a drug that blocks the effect of ghrelin is a safe and
effective weight-loss treatment. Until then, stomach bypass surgery
"will remain an important therapy for severe obesity," they said.</TE>
<TE>   And for people trying to put on weight, especially people
suffering from cancer and other wasting disorders, it is possible
that treatment with ghrelin may prevent the severe and dangerous
weight loss, the Fliers said.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, researchers reported in the journal Nature that
injections of ghrelin made rodents eat more and become obese.</TE>

<HD>Sept. 11 Hijackers Kept a Low Profile in the U.S.</HD>
<DH>Attacks: They entered the country legally and broke few
laws. That contrasts with 1990s terrorists, who tried to exploit U.S.
weaknesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Sept. 11 hijackers departed from the pattern of earlier
terrorists by initially entering the country legally and breaking
comparatively few laws before the attacks, according to an analysis
released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   While Islamic terrorist schemes in the 1990s involved permanent
U.S. residents and naturalized citizens, the Sept. 11 hijackers were
foreigners who prepared for their attack while exploiting their
short-term immigration status, reported the Center on Immigration
Studies, a group that seeks to restrict immigration into this
country.</LD>
<LD>   The Sept. 11 hijackers "are different in that they don't seem to
have violated the law as much as some terrorists in the past," said
Steven A. Camarota, the center's research director and the report's
author. The brief U.S. stays and general lack of actions that would
have alerted law enforcement "may represent a kind of growing
sophistication on the part of Al Qaeda," he added.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, all the attacks by Islamic terrorists in recent
years underscored specific, gaping holes in the nation's border
security, including abuse of amnesty provisions and petitions for
political asylum, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   The report examined the cases of 48 Islamic terrorists who were
involved in plots to kill employees outside CIA headquarters, attack
the World Trade Center in 1993 and bomb Los Angeles International
Airport, the Brooklyn subways and New York City landmarks.</TE>
<TE>   Among the findings:</TE>
<TE>   * Of the 48 terrorists, 17 enjoyed status as lawful, permanent
U.S. residents or naturalized U.S. citizens. This group included
three of those who plotted to bomb the World Trade Center in 1993 and
10 who sought to destroy landmarks in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing I found surprising when I did the research was
the large number of lawful permanent residents and naturalized
citizens involved in terrorism," Camarota said. "I thought it was
mostly illegals--asylum applicants, people who had abused the system
or temporary visa holders."</TE>
<TE>   * One-fourth of the 48 terrorists were illegal immigrants at the
time of their crimes. Others engaged in sham marriages to remain in
this country. Among them: Fadil Abdelgani, who schemed to bomb New
York landmarks, and Khalid Abu al Dahab, a U.S. recruiter for Al
Qaeda, the terrorist network linked to Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   * Terrorists, including Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind cleric
who was later jailed for his role in the plot to blow up landmarks in
New York, also violated immigration law by lying on their
applications for permanent residence. "The public record is
unambiguous that at least 21 of these guys had some significant
violations of immigration law prior to engaging in terrorism,"
Camarota said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers, most entered the United States
legally with tourist visas issued by U.S. consular officials in Saudi
Arabia, typically aided by a "visa express" program that streamlined
the entire process.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, the Justice Department's inspector general
released a report criticizing the Immigration and Naturalization
Service for readmitting Mohamed Atta in January 2001 because his
requested change from tourist to student status had not yet been
approved. Also, police issued a warrant for Atta last June after he
failed to appear in court for a traffic ticket. Apparently, three of
the 19 hijackers had overstayed their visas by Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The information in the report draws upon previously gathered facts
in a manner that dramatizes vulnerabilities of America's system of
border security. Congress has moved since Sept. 11 to enhance border
security and to overhaul the beleaguered INS, but severely
restricting immigration, as Camarota's group advocates, remains
controversial.</TE>
<TE>   "There really isn't anybody who doesn't agree with the basic idea
that we need to do more to keep the bad guys out," Camarota said.</TE>
<TE>   The report also documented efforts to exploit a past amnesty,
another hot-button issue in Congress. Mahmud Abouhalima and his
brother Mohammed Abouhalima overstayed tourist visas in the 1980s,
and each was granted permanent residence as part of an amnesty for
illegal farm workers despite no evidence that either had ever worked
in agriculture, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   Mahmud Abouhalima made several trips to Afghanistan for combat
training after receiving the amnesty; he was later implicated in the
plot to bomb New York landmarks.</TE>
<TE>   He then fled to Egypt with the help of his brother, Mohammed, who
was convicted of being an accessory after the fact for helping in the
escape.</TE>

<HD>Lindh Lawyers Offer New Account of Captivity</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Court papers cite reports about harsh conditions
during interrogation. Subpoena is sought for second 'American Talib.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Lawyers for John Walker Lindh, hoping to have their client's alleged
confession thrown out of court, released fresh details Wednesday
about his captivity in Afghanistan that strongly suggest he was held
under very harsh conditions when he agreed to talk to U.S.
interrogators.</LD>
<LD>   The Lindh defense team also asked a federal judge to subpoena a
second American-born Taliban member who has been detained and who the
Lindh lawyers hope might show that Lindh was not a terrorist fighting
against the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The lawyers have long complained that any statements that Lindh
made after his arrest came only because he was mistreated and feared
for his life if he did not cooperate.</LD>
<TE>   The government, however, has maintained that Lindh, a 21-year-old
who was raised in Northern California, volunteered to be interviewed
by U.S. officials and that he was was not coerced.</TE>
<TE>   In court papers filed Wednesday, defense lawyers said they want to
interview seven U.S. service members who guarded Lindh in the days
after his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   A member of the Navy, for instance, reported to his superiors that
Lindh "could not walk without assistance, passed out at least once
and was given an IV because he was dehydrated," the defense team
said.</TE>
<TE>   Another member of the Navy reported that he spoke with Lindh
aboard the amphibious assault ship Peleliu and said Lindh "was
nervous because of past experiences." The guard said Lindh "required
a wheelchair when he arrived on [the] USS Peleliu ... and that he had
frostbite and shrapnel on his feet."</TE>
<TE>   The defense said a third Navy member described how "Lindh was
transported to the interview room on a stretcher, blindfolded, with
his hands and legs restrained." The guard added that "Lindh was still
in restraints when he allegedly signed a waiver-of-rights form."</TE>
<TE>   A fourth Navy member said U.S. military personnel took "souvenir"
photographs of Lindh in bondage. And a fifth said the military "broke
with procedure" by selecting Lindh for criminal prosecution rather
than keeping him with other detainees sent to the U.S. Naval Base at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the defense said, a soldier and a Marine noted that
Lindh was kept in freezing conditions at night, "immediately
preceding and up through his interrogation by an FBI agent."</TE>
<TE>   On the issue of the second so-called American Talib, the Lindh
lawyers want to interview Yaser Esam Hamdi to see whether he might
corroborate their defense that Lindh was not a terrorist but a member
of the Taliban fighting the Northern Alliance rather than the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Hamdi clearly has material and exculpatory testimony" that
would help the Lindh defense, the lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   Hamdi was born in Baton Rouge, La., but soon afterward moved to
Saudi Arabia with his parents, who were natives of that country. He
too was captured fighting with the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   It was only recently that U.S. officials determined that Hamdi had
dual U.S.-Saudi citizenship. He was then removed from Guantanamo Bay
and taken to a military prison in Norfolk, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have asked U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III to
postpone a decision on whether the defense can speak with Hamdi until
the judge rules on whether the defense also can speak with detainees
in Guantanamo Bay.</TE>
<TE>   But Lindh's attorneys argued that since Hamdi has been moved out
of Cuba, they should be allowed to interview him now.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Smithsonian Institution has gathered symbols and artifacts from
the Sept. 11 attacks for a commemorative exhibition that will open to
the public on the first anniversary of the attacks, museum officials
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Remembering is as important a part of our survival as is taking
the next steps to make sure it never happens again," said Marc
Pachter, the National Museum of American History's acting director,
where the exhibition will take place.</LD>
<LD>   About 3,000 people were killed Sept. 11 when hijackers used three
commercial planes as bombs to destroy New York's World Trade Center
and attack the Pentagon. A fourth plane crashed in Pennsylvania.</LD>
<TE>   The exhibition will be the first to include artifacts from all
three crash sites, officials said at a news conference, and will
include items like a piece of twisted metal from the World Trade
Center and a charred, damaged bit of concrete from the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Charred uniforms, photographs and a teddy bear left at the
Pennsylvania crash memorial site will also be included.</TE>
<TE>   A bill signed into law by President Bush in January gave the
Smithsonian up to $5 million to collect and preserve objects related
to the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The staff consulted U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum officials on
the exhibit.</TE>

<LD>Frustrated by Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge's refusal to
testify before Congress, a committee of the Democratic-led Senate
approved legislation Wednesday to require him to do so.</LD>
<LD>   On a party-line 7-3 vote, the Governmental Affairs Committee sent
to the full Senate a bill to elevate Ridge's White House office to a
Cabinet-level department, making it accountable to Congress.</LD>
<LD>   The measure also would give Ridge budget authority over a number
of federal agencies as he moves to bolster security in the aftermath
of the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>

Wednesday aimed at compelling Ridge to testify.</TE>

<HD>Skakel Away at Time of Murder, Kin Say</HD>
<DH>Courts: Defendant's brother and cousin have trouble
recalling specific details about October 1975 events beyond those
involving the alibi.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NORWALK, Conn.</DL>
<LD>Michael Skakel was miles away at his cousin's Greenwich estate the
October 1975 night Martha Moxley was murdered, Skakel's brother and
cousin testified Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   But Skakel's relatives had trouble recalling events surrounding
the murder other than those related to his alibi. And the cousin's
account differed in some respects from Skakel's own version, played
on a tape Wednesday when the prosecution rested its case.</LD>
<LD>   "What they specifically recall is their part of the alibi and
nothing else," said John Moxley, the victim's brother. "It's bad
acting. Over the years these guys are forgetting their lines."</LD>
<TE>   Skakel, 41, is charged with beating Moxley to death with a golf
club that was traced to a set owned by the Skakel family. Both Skakel
and Moxley were 15 at the time. Skakel is a nephew of the late Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel.</TE>
<TE>   The defense, which opened its case Wednesday, is trying to narrow
the time of Moxley's death to the period when Skakel says he and his
brothers took a trip to his cousin's house.</TE>
<TE>   A friend of Skakel's sister has testified that Skakel was not in
the car that went to his cousin's house. Defense lawyers plan to call
her back to challenge her testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have not pinpointed the time of death but have said it
occurred between 9:30 p.m. Oct. 30 and 5 a.m. Oct. 31.</TE>
<TE>   On the tape, Skakel described a night of drinking and smoking
marijuana at his cousin's house. He said that after returning home,
he became sexually aroused and went to look for Moxley by climbing a
tree on her property. Moxley's body was found under a pine tree on
her property.</TE>
<TE>   Rushton Skakel Jr., Skakel's older brother, and his cousin James
Dowdle said Michael Skakel was with them when they left the Skakel
house about 9:30 p.m. They said they left the Dowdles' estate shortly
before 11 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   In the tape, Skakel describes the house as a "fantasy land" with
no adult supervision.</TE>
<TE>   On cross-examination, Rushton Skakel said he could not recall the
commotion associated with the slaying the next day. The witness, a
Dartmouth College student at the time, also said he had no memory of
taking a trip with his entire family to give statements to the police
a few weeks later.</TE>
<TE>   On the tape played by the prosecution, Michael Skakel had said
Rushton was too drunk to drive home from his cousin's and that
another brother, John, who did not have a driver's license, took the
wheel.</TE>
<TE>   But Dowdle said Rushton appeared fine. Rushton denied he was
drunk, and said John took over because he didn't like the way Rushton
was driving.</TE>
<TE>   Michael also said on the tape that he and Moxley were sitting in
the family car until it was time to take Dowdle home. Dowdle,
however, said Michael came out of the house with him when it was time
to go.</TE>
<TE>   "It happened so long ago, I just can't remember those kinds of
details," Dowdle said.</TE>

<HD>Man Fires Shotgun in Airport; 2 Injured</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KENNER, La.</DL>
<LD>A man wounded two people with a shotgun at the New Orleans airport
Wednesday, telling investigators that he fired because people made
fun of his turban.</LD>
<LD>   "That's his story. We don't know what really happened," Jefferson
Parish Sheriff Harry Lee said.</LD>
<LD>   The shotgun blast wounded an airline customer in the stomach and
an airline employee in the hand, the sheriff said. The gunman was
tackled by bystanders in the ticket lobby of Louis Armstrong
International Airport.</LD>
<TE>   The shooting occurred away from concourses where security
screeners check for weapons. Flights continued amid delays. Lee
identified the suspect as Patrick Gott, 43, of Pensacola, Fla. He
said Gott was carrying a Koran and invoked the name of Allah.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff said Gott told deputies he was in the terminal when
people began making fun of his turban. He told investigators that he
left the terminal, retrieved a shotgun from his car, went back inside
and fired, Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff said the wounded customer was hospitalized in guarded
condition. A sheriff's spokesman said the suspect and his mother were
at the airport to drop off a passenger.</TE>

<DH>West: Colorado blaze threatens structures. In Arizona,
flames prompt recreational closures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DECKERS, Colo.</DL>
<LD>A wildfire burning out of control in the Pike National Forest grew to
4,000 acres Wednesday as one house was destroyed and area residents
were told to leave their homes.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze started Tuesday and was burning mostly fir and pine
trees Wednesday, Pueblo Interagency Fire Dispatch spokesman Pete
Davis said.</LD>
<LD>   Residents of about 75 homes in Deckers and surrounding communities
were told to leave Wednesday afternoon, Douglas County sheriff's Lt.
Kim Castanello said.</LD>
<TE>   An additional 300 homes and 20 businesses were threatened by the
flames, fire officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The fire, driven by 50 mph winds, traveled about two miles by
Wednesday afternoon and jumped across a highway as it moved
northeast.</TE>
<TE>   It grew by 2,500 acres between noon and 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Five air tankers, three helicopters and 220 firefighters were
called in, but strong winds and steep terrain kept firefighters from
battling the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Three campgrounds and some area parks were evacuated and will be
closed over Memorial Day weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Two other fires near Nucla in the Uncompahgre National Forest
threatened some cabins.</TE>
<TE>   Extra firefighters were being called in.</TE>
<TE>   Several other fires were burning in the West.</TE>
<TE>   In southern Arizona's Santa Catalina Mountains, crews battled a
wind-whipped wildfire that had burned more than 6,800 acres of grass,
juniper and mes- quite.</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate threat to structures, but a pre-evacuation
notice was sent to about 150 homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   Pima County sheriff's Lt. Terry Parrish said half of the 400
cabins are occupied year-round in Summerhaven, a mountaintop
community.</TE>
<TE>   "But during the Memorial Day weekend we may have 10,000 people,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot easier to preclude them than to evacuate them if we
have to," Parrish said.</TE>
<TE>   A highway to Summerhaven was closed to all but full-time
residents.</TE>
<TE>   Parrish also said that about 600 children scheduled to attend
camps there this weekend might be turned away.</TE>
<TE>   "Until we can be assured that the fire is not going to go up the
mountain, we're not going to open the road," he said.</TE>

<HD>Hearing Focuses on N-Waste Shipping</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Critics and supporters of the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste
site sparred Wednesday over whether thousands of tons of highly
radioactive waste can be shipped safely.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Halstead, a consultant for the state of Nevada, said claims
by the Energy Department that waste would likely be shipped to the
proposed dump 90 miles from Las Vegas largely by rail and be limited
to 175 shipments a year were unrealistic. Many of the reactor sites
do not have rail connections, he said.</LD>
<LD>   He also said no full-scale tests have been done--or are
required--to ensure shipping casks will protect the highly
radioactive material during a terrorist attack or serious accident.</LD>
<TE>   Halstead, testifying before the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee, said the Energy Department's own analysis
estimated there would be at least 450 shipments a year if most are
shipped by rail, and 2,200 a year if most end up being shipped by
highway over 24 years.</TE>
<TE>   The Energy Department recently said it is speeding up development,
along with the states through which the waste would travel, of a
detailed transportation plan.</TE>
<TE>   Senators supporting the Yucca Mountain project reiterated Energy
Department claims that in 30 years of shipping nuclear waste there
has never been a release of radioactive material harmful to the
public or the environment.</TE>
<TE>   According to materials distributed by the Nuclear Energy
Institute, the trade group for the nuclear power industry, a 1999
study by Sandia National Laboratory concluded the release of
radioactivity would be extremely small even if a waste shipment cask
were hit by a "high-energy weapon."</TE>
<TE>   Halstead said there were 11 transportation accidents involving
used nuclear fuel shipments between 1957 and 1964, including several
involving radioactive releases requiring cleanup.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush in February concluded that there has been enough
scientific study of the Yucca Mountain site to seek construction and
operating permits from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada vetoed Bush's decision, as the state is allowed under a
1982 nuclear waste law. It is now up to Congress to decide whether to
override the Nevada veto.</TE>
