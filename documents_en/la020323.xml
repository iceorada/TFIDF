<DH>Pioneers of narco-corridos are distancing themselves from
today's brasher songs of the border drug trade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pedro Rivera, L.A.'s king of narco-corridos, feels ashamed when he
surveys what's become of the controversial genre he helped make so
popular during the past decade.</LD>
<LD>   The amicable and industrious immigrant amassed a small family
fortune producing records about drug-running, killing and corruption
on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. And he cultivated a dynasty
of "narquillos" in two of his sons, including L.A.'s only living
narco-singer-turned-superstar, Lupillo Rivera.</LD>
<LD>   But now, says the musical patriarch, people are sick of the same
old songs and story lines. Instant narco-singers have cropped up like
poppies in every barrio, he feels, and they all say they're from
Sinaloa, the state notorious for brassy bands and brash cartels.
Armchair narco-composers write songs about drug lords they never met
involved in escapades so improbable they belong in comic books, not
corridos, or narrative songs.</LD>
<TE>   What's more, Rivera laments, some corrido-style songs are now
sullied with crude and vulgar lyrics too shocking for most decent
bordellos.</TE>
<TE>   "Nowadays, there's so many fly-by-night labels putting out fantasy
corridos, that I'm ashamed to go to market with my records," says
Rivera, who owns Long Beach-based Cintas Acuario music label. "The
whole thing has really been ruined."</TE>
<TE>   Rivera's downbeat business assessment reflects a significant shift
in corrido music, a lucrative niche within the Mexican music market.
Today, it seems, the star veterans of narco-corridos want to distance
themselves from the subgenre that helped propel them to prominence.
Even Los Tigres del Norte, the recognized pioneers of the modern
narco-corrido who perform tonight at the L.A. Sports Arena, are
worried about the degeneration of the genre they helped create.</TE>
<TE>   The rush for a quick buck, say artists and students of the scene,
has cheapened the historic Mexican song form, once so literary and
true-to-life it served as the musical newspaper of the masses. Though
the narco-corrido has survived public displeasure and outright
government censorship in Mexico, its ascent has finally been arrested
by that old entertainment bugaboo--overexposure and excessive
exploitation.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be that the period of narco-corridos has come to an end,"
says UCLA Spanish professor and corrido expert Guillermo Hernandez.
"The new corridos aren't going anywhere. You don't have any memorable
ones now. They're just here today and gone tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Although corridos have been popular for more than a century and
can be about any topic, the fabled narco-corrido about drug smuggling
emerged as a powerful force over the past three decades. The tales of
derring-do and death made international stars of California-based
artists such as the Riveras, San Jose's Los Tigres and L.A.'s Chalino
Sanchez, the gunslinging narco-icon murdered in 1992 after a show in
Sinaloa.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, though, top corrido acts have all backed away from the
genre on their latest albums.</TE>
<TE>   Tigres now lean more toward songs with a social conscience. Los
Tucanes de Tijuana, another top corrido act, have a surprise
bestseller with a compilation album of their old love songs.</TE>
<TE>   And Lupillo Rivera, who has steadily steered away from gangster
origins as a strategy to reach a wider audience, now favors
traditional Mexican tunes. The shaven-headed idol is now recording
the syrupy "Amorcito Corazon" (Little Love of My Heart), the Pedro
Infante classic scheduled for his next album.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, say the musicians, there hasn't been much narco-news
lately. The only recent big story with corrido potential is last
month's killing by Mexican police of Ramon Arellano Felix, enforcer
of the notorious Tijuana drug cartel, and the subsequent capture of
his brother, Benjamin.</TE>
<TE>   Lupillo and his father are already working on a corrido on that
topic. But for his next album in the genre, the younger Rivera plans
to return to traditional themes--horses and revolutionary heroes.</TE>
<TE>   Into this corrido vacuum has rushed a new style of aggressive
music--the shocking put-down song. Lesser known norteno acts have
found sudden popularity by insulting each other with profane, crude
and sexually explicit lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   The dissing matches are now the new rage among a certain rowdy
segment of L.A.'s corrido crowd, the hoi polloi counterpart to
professional wrestling fans. A battle of the bands between two
heavyweights in this style--Los Originales de San Juan and their
rivals Los Razos--deteriorated into a bottle-throwing mob scene at a
sold-out, open-air concert in El Monte Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Strictly speaking, these X-rated song duels are not really
corridos, a genre that usually involves a brave or heroic figure in a
tragic confrontation with powers that be. But since corrido bands are
now engaged in the crass blasts, more respectable groups fear being
tarred by association.</TE>
<TE>   "These other colleagues have come out and have degraded the
drama," says Tigres leader Jorge Hernandez. "So we don't want to
follow that game. Because instead of helping the industry, they hurt
it by making things up and using bad language."</TE>
<TE>   The foulmouthed newcomers are no Sex Pistols or N.W.A brimming
with youthful outrage and rebellion. They're middle-aged,
beer-bellied men who call each other "Mummy" and "Monkey Face."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some observers see a rap parallel.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole L.A. corrido scene to a large extent has been a Mexican
analog to the gangster rap world," says writer and musician Elijah
Wald, author of a recent book about the narco-corrido. "Now you have
groups cursing each other and their fans getting into fights, which
is exactly where the gangster rap world went."</TE>
<TE>   And that's exactly where Los Tigres refuse to go.</TE>
<TE>   The quintet has an extra reason to clean up its act: They have
emerged as political spokesmen for the immigrant community,
especially the millions of workers who entered the country illegally,
as did they themselves in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   The group built its recording and film career with early
narco-hits like "Contrabando y Traicion" (Contraband and Betrayal),
about the exploits of a borderland Bonnie and Clyde.</TE>
<TE>   But don't expect any of the group's famous drug-smuggling sagas to
show up on its official playlist for tonight's concert, billed as "El
Baile de los Trabajadores," the Workers' Dance. Sponsored by
community organizations and endorsed by the Catholic Church, the
event is part of an effort to persuade Congress to legalize immigrant
workers with a new amnesty for the undocumented.</TE>
<TE>   Narco-corridos are the antithesis of the image promoters want to
project from the Sports Arena.</TE>
<TE>   At a press conference with Los Tigres earlier this month, a
bishop, a labor leader and a pair of workers stressed that the
immigrant community is hard-working and law-abiding. That's hardly
the picture conveyed by Tigres tunes about Mexicans smuggling
marijuana across the border hidden in the tires of their cars.</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, Los Tigres have always written songs about the
travails of average immigrants who are looking for a better life, not
a life of crime. Those are the songs they plan to highlight tonight,
though they won't turn down requests for fans' narco-favorites.</TE>
<TE>   "We're like a newspaper, but in song," says the Tigres' Jorge
Hernandez. "And just like a newspaper, we must tell the good and the
bad about things that happen in this country to our undocumented
friends. This makes people wake up, but we must always tell the
truth."</TE>
<TE>   The truth about the drug trade doesn't have to be offensive, the
artists say. The stories can be told as cautionary tales with
metaphors rather than explicit lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   "El corrido es cultura," says Mario Quintero of Los Tucanes. "The
corrido is culture. And it should be for the whole family, including
the children who come to our shows. What they see in their idols is
what they're going to learn. So as human beings, we need to be more
responsible."</TE>
<TE>   At one time, Mexicans viewed the drug trade as a problem for
Americans, says UCLA's Hernandez. Mexicans saw themselves as drug
suppliers, but all the consumers lived north of the border. Once drug
use started creeping into Mexican families, he says, the public's
appetite for narco-corridos started eroding. "Drugs are a real
problem in Mexico now, so the consequences of the drug traffic are
not passed on lightly," says Hernandez, who has organized four
international conferences on the corrido. "Mexicans are starting to
feel the repercussions of the drug trade in their own lack of
security and safety."</TE>
<TE>   The drug problem hit home for Pedro Rivera when his son Juan was
admitted to a drug treatment program, at 16. The young man later
recounted his experience in a corrido called "Soy Malandrin" (I'm a
Scoundrel), which was recorded by Los Razos, the band the elder
Rivera now disdains.</TE>
<TE>   Today, with his father's encouragement, Juan is also rising above
the artistic straights of the narco-corrido. Now 24 and a father of
three, he has a Sony album coming out that will reflect the more
normal concerns of youth, and the joy of traditional songs like "La
Bamba."</TE>
<TE>   "It'll have a very different vibe from the life he led before,"
says his father. "We suffered very much over our son, but we pulled
him out of that lifestyle."</TE>
<TE>   One good thing came of the family's pain, says the elder Rivera:
"A very real corrido."</TE>

<HD>A Big Band Tradition From Laura Pursell</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Retro was in the air Thursday night with a performance by singer
Laura Pursell and her All Star Band at Spazio in Sherman Oaks. Echoes
of the '40s and '50s--of briskly swinging music, of vocalists whose
work was an integral element of an ensemble, of jazz instrumentalists
cutting loose over danceable rhythms--filled the room.</LD>
<LD>   Pursell, who has three CDs in release--"It Had to Be Swing,"
"UnKISSed" and "That's What Christmas Used to Be"--offered her vocals
in the fashion of such big band canaries as Jo Stafford and Helen
Forrest. Most of the selections came straight out of the top hits
chapter of the great American songbook: "Almost Like Being in Love,"
"Watch What Happens," "Skylark," "Pennies From Heaven."</LD>
<LD>   And the arrangements, virtually all written by Rusty Higgins for a
seven-piece ensemble, were reminiscent of the little big band groups
that were popular in the West Coast jazz movement of the '50s.</LD>
<TE>   From a contemporary perspective, the musical mix seemed a bit busy
at times. Pursell, a still maturing singer, displayed an attractive
sense of musical line in her rendering of "Skylark," and the rarely
heard verse to "Pennies From Heaven" offered one of the set's few
opportunities to hear her dark-toned voice in an unaccompanied
setting. It would be interesting to hear her singing take the central
position in the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   On this evening, however, swing was the thing. And when Pursell
was joined by singer Julia Holland to romp through upbeat renderings
of "Choo Choo Ch'Boogie" and "Undecided," the only element missing
was a floor full of jitterbugging dancers.</TE>
<TE>   Pursell and her All Stars return to Spazio on April 25, as the
attractive jazz and supper club continues to diversify its bookings.
Monday nights, for example, are now devoted to Latin jazz, with Bobby
Matos, Louie Cruz Beltran and the Banda Brothers, among others,
scheduled to perform in the next few weeks. And on Sunday, singer
Judy Chamberlain hosts an Oscar night buffet with multiple 10-foot
video screens for the television broadcast, followed by a jam session
and big band dance music.</TE>

<LD>The goings-on surrounding the attempted smear campaign of Ron
Howard's "A Beautiful Mind" should make a portion of the Hollywood
community cower in shame ("Oscar Fever Is Pushing the Envelope of
Civility," by Lorenza Munoz, March 16).</LD>
<LD>   This is an industry whose main purpose is to make money by
entertaining us. If you have seen "A Beautiful Mind" and for that two
or so hours were captivated by its story or performances, cried or
laughed or left the theater a little more knowledgeable then when you
came in, then that film fulfilled its only obligation to the
movie-going public.</LD>
<LD>   Contrary to those whose only purpose in life seems to be
destroying someone else's creation to make themselves look better,
when I see something "based" on a true story, I know up front that I
am getting an interpretation, a point of view of the author or
director. I am not stupid enough to believe that every scene must be
an indisputable fact.</LD>
<TE>   The possibility that a paranoid schizophrenic also might have been
bothered by fears of a particular ethnic group had no place at all in
the film and should come as no surprise, given the pathology of the
illness.</TE>
<TE>   But if you want to make pathology an issue, then consider the
minds of those in Hollywood who want to influence others by trying to
get people to believe that a director's vision is somehow diminished,
actors' performances somehow stilted and the work of editors and set
decorators now lessened because a creative effort, better than their
own, did not meticulously stick to facts.</TE>
<TE>   KENNY RICH</TE>
<TE>   West Hills</TE>
<TE>   I don't mean to belittle the question of whether the film "A
Beautiful Mind" plays fast and loose with the facts of John Nash's
life. Nor am I pleased to consider the specter of smear campaigns
becoming the norm for future Oscar seasons. But shouldn't these be
secondary issues to the question of whether "Mind" is really as good
a movie as it pretends to be?</TE>
<TE>   I hope, but doubt, that all the players crying foul over the
film's bad publicity will consider the possibility that their darling
may go home empty-handed on Sunday night, strictly on the merits of
the other nominees. If Denzel Washington, Robert Altman or the
writers of "Ghost World" win their respective Oscars, it will not be
because of some ill spin but because each of them is far more
deserving than anyone involved with the overly pat and inauthentic
"Beautiful Mind."</TE>
<TE>   THOMAS EARLHAM</TE>
<TE>   Burbank</TE>
<TE>   I would like to know why Miramax studios has spent so much money
advertising "In the Bedroom" and calling Sissy Spacek's performance
"the year's most acclaimed and powerful performance" while totally
ignoring Judi Dench's performance in "Iris," which it also released?
Dench's performance was more diverse and complex.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the amount spent on publicizing a film and its star is
far more important than the performance. I can still remember when
John Wayne won his Oscar against Richard Burton's performance in
"Anne of the Thousand Days." I guess I'll find a book to read on
Oscar night.</TE>
<TE>   DARIA CASE</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks</TE>
<TE>   For a guy who hasn't made a good movie since "MASH" (1970), Robert
Altman's "short fuse and big mouth" act ("Cinema's Grouch,
Independent and Young at Heart," by Patrick Goldstein, March 19) is
tiresome and boring, much like his latest snoozer, "Gosford Park."</TE>
<TE>   CARL MOORE</TE>
<TE>   Lomita</TE>
<TE>   How ironic that the place that stands for movies, glamour and,
most of all, its loyal fans is closed, restricted and shut down on
the most important night of the year for the movie industry ("The
Security Rope Will Not Be Velvet," by George Ramos, March 19).</TE>
<TE>   It seems like a plot from a really bad B movie: "Hollywood gets
long-awaited facelift, shuts out shopkeepers, fans and stargazers."
Well, that's show biz for ya, kid!</TE>

<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   Updating 'E.T.'</TE>
<TE>   It's every artist's right to revisit his past work, but I found
the tone so disheartening in Michael Mallory's article on the "E.T."
re-release ("A New Smile, but the Same Charm, From 'E.T.'," March
16). Both the film's producers and Mallory seemed almost gleeful in
their description of how "E.T." was being transformed to appeal to
today's audience.</TE>
<TE>   Would the palpable joy have been so evident if we were talking
about Da Vinci adding a nose ring and a tattoo to his "Mona Lisa"? Or
Shakespeare adding the words "dude" or "da bomb" to "Hamlet"?</TE>
<TE>   Somehow filmmakers feel they can make themselves immune from
history if they use current technology to update the past. While
Spielberg and the producers add that they will preserve the original
cut to appease "purists," one has to ask which version is likely to
be shown on cable or resold down the road on DVD's successor
technology?</TE>
<TE>   One only has to look at Spielberg's own "updating" of "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind" to resign oneself to that reality. I
ask, when was the last time any of you saw the original 1977
theatrical cut of "Close Encounters" on VHS, DVD or in a revival
house?</TE>

<TE>   'Mirroring Evil's' Conceit</TE>
<TE>   People protesting the "Mirroring Evil" exhibition at the Jewish
Museum in New York ("A Piercing Look," by Geraldine Baum, March 16)
are missing the point of contemporary art. This art is created to
irritate, to shock and to offend. Artspeak, otherwise known as
catalog notes, exists to create a bridge between offensive artists
and potential buyers by pretending that the act of offending an
audience is an expression of the impulse that makes artists superior
to ordinary people.</TE>
<TE>   This should be obvious. What else could motivate a curator
explaining that artists using Nazi imagery to further their own
careers are actually commenting on "how Nazism has been glamorized
and commodified"? If contemporary art critics didn't spend all of
their time explaining this type of art to the pathetically offendable
non-artists who are its only potential market, why would anyone buy
it?</TE>

<TE>   Glendale</TE>
<TE>   Where's the Music?</TE>
<TE>   The last day of the All Tomorrow's Parties festival was a joke. I
don't know what Sonic Youth is trying to push on us, but I'm not
buying. What I heard on Sunday ("Not All Bands Act Like It's Party
Time," by Steve Hochman, March 19) was aimless noise, awful vocals
and bad poetry.</TE>
<TE>   Non-mainstream music does not have to be bad. There are worthy
non-mainstream bands that craft well-thought-out music and songs. I
just wish they had been at UCLA on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   DANIEL CLELAND</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clarita</TE>
<TE>   Your recent article ("Country Radio Is Now 'Music of the
Suburbs,'" by Steve Carney, March 8) about country radio's rejection
of the music from the Grammy-winning "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
soundtrack misses the point. Country radio and folk music have almost
nothing to do with each other--they divorced more than three decades
ago. All across America, the true home for folk, bluegrass and other
roots music has been the network of public radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   That is, except in Los Angeles. KCRW-FM, the powerhouse station
for the hipper-than-hip crowd, refuses to program any shows for roots
music fans (or anyone over 30), preferring the latest electronica
from the U.K. or the next big thing from NYC. KPPC-FM in Pasadena,
once home of fine music shows such as "City Billy" and "D-Tuning,"
has gone all talk, except for "Prairie Home Companion." Worst of all,
after 30 years of producing "Folkscene," one of the most respected
folk-roots radio shows in the country, Howard and Roz Larman were

<TE>   The recent change in management at the Pacifica station holds a
glimmer of hope that the Larmans will return to the air and folk fans

<HD>Will Kodak Develop as a Sound Venue?</HD>
<DH>The acoustics, criticized by some, may influence the
theater's success after the Oscars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kodak Theatre's introduction to most of the world Sunday during
the 74th Academy Awards makes its debut something of a Cinderella
story. But what happens after the clock strikes 12?</LD>
<LD>   Once the Oscar ceremony fades to black, the glossy new facility
certainly won't turn into a pumpkin, but will become the site of
periodic pop and rock concerts, entertainment industry private
functions, television and video broadcasts and tapings, and possibly
a few big-bang theatrical shows.</LD>
<LD>   But questions about Kodak's ability not just to look great on
camera but to sound good in person raise another question: As a live
entertainment venue, is Kodak shaping up as Staples Center Jr.?</LD>
<TE>   The parallels go beyond the fact that both were built by Canada's
TrizecHahn Development Corp. and are operated by Denver-based
Anschutz Entertainment Group.</TE>
<TE>   There have also been similarities--good and bad--between their
experiences out of the gate, especially how they handle anything
besides their primary functions as, respectively, a sports arena and
the home of the annual Academy Awards.</TE>
<TE>   Initial concerts at both venues drew big names: Bruce Springsteen
at Staples, pop-classical tenor Russell Watson at Kodak.</TE>
<TE>   And both quickly suffered the slings and arrows of some outraged
fans and critics over the sound quality. Daily Variety said that "the
string sound was abrasive and tinny" during Watson's theater-opening
concert in November, and that "the amplification made it impossible
to determine [Watson's] true vocal power." Times music critic Mark
Swed suggested "one would have to go back to the beginning of sound
reproduction to find such a primitive representation of an
orchestra."</TE>
<TE>   Just as Staples' sound problems continued when Bette Midler
followed Springsteen, another Daily Variety reviewer complained of
"brittle sound" during Melissa Etheridge's solo performance at the
Kodak in December, while The Times called the sound "a muddled mess"
at Barry Manilow's show in January.</TE>
<TE>   When American Ballet Theatre came to the Kodak for performances of
"The Nutcracker" in December, ABT artistic director Kevin McKenzie
said it was "the first time we've had to amplify an orchestra in a
theater," but added, "I thought the sound was very good."</TE>
<TE>   For those watching the Kodak closely, the situation has the ring
of deja vu. Only unlike Staples, which has three professional sports
franchises to fill the bulk of its winter and spring calendar, Kodak
will be more dependent on entertainment bookings because the Academy
Awards come but once a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who's been in the business for a while realizes that for
the first few shows that go into any new building, adjustments have
to be made in the acoustics and/or sound amplification before it's
optimized," says Gary Bongiovanni, editor of the concert-industry
tracking publication Pollstar. "That's not unusual. Conseco
Fieldhouse [in Chicago] had its sound problems when it opened. So did
Staples with those Springsteen shows. But I haven't heard anything
bad about Staples Center since those first few shows."</TE>
<TE>   What's happening at Kodak is fairly typical: A new building means
a new acoustical space, new sound systems and new users of both who
need time to figure them out. In the meantime, glitches happen.</TE>
<TE>   "There is certainly a break-in period," says Robert F. Mahoney,
the Boulder, Colo., acoustician who engineered the Kodak's acoustic
properties at the behest of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences. "As a rule, you need about a year before you really get to
know how the space works."</TE>
<TE>   Mahoney said primary design consideration was given to amplified
performances, which expect to make up the bulk of the theater's
activity between Oscar nights. That means even orchestras will be
amplified, because the Kodak's acoustics were designed to be dry,
some call it "dead," rather than lively and reverberant, to better
accommodate the variety of uses expected.</TE>
<TE>   "Would it be my first choice as a venue for symphonic music?
Absolutely not," says Tom Sorce, who ran the sound for Watson's
concert, during which the 76-piece orchestra backing the singer was
loudly amplified. "But I think the design and the theater sound
system will work very well with a lot of [other] applications."</TE>
<TE>   Sorce, who has engineered the sound for 20 years for performances
from Broadway shows and symphonic-pop concerts to such rock and pop
acts as Aerosmith, Van Halen and Matchbox Twenty, adds: "If you're a
classical guy and you walk in there and see a 76-piece orchestra and
a tenor, in your mind's eye, you're thinking, 'Ahh, symphonic music.'
But [Watson's concert] was not a classic symphony show. He's got a
beautiful tenor voice and is singing with an orchestra at pop
[volume] levels, and that's his choice artistically."</TE>
<TE>   Etheridge's sound engineer, however, found himself hurriedly
compensating for the room's lack of natural reverberation when the
curtain went up on her show.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds better empty than full, and usually it's the opposite"
said Steve Folsom, Etheridge's sound engineer for 13 years. "It was a
surprise to me on the first song when all of a sudden, what I was
hearing wasn't close to what I'd been hearing during our afternoon
sound check. So I had to scramble on that first song....But I wasn't
unhappy with the results at all. At least, I didn't get any
complaints to my face. But it's definitely more challenging than one
would hope in a new room."</TE>
<TE>   Few Pop Pros Know the</TE>
<TE>   House Sound System</TE>
<TE>   Another issue is that the house sound system, by Berkeley-based
Meyer Sound, also is causing some sound crews difficulties at first
sight.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of Broadway-type theaters use that equipment, but for pop
or rock tours, oh man, maybe only 10% [of sound engineers] have run
into that," says Ken Newman, Manilow's sound engineer for the last
decade. "It's considered the cream of the crop and very high-tech,
but it's a different kind of good than most people are used to."</TE>
<TE>   In terms of size, the Kodak's 3,500-seat capacity represents an
attractive niche in the pop concert market between facilities such as
the 2,200-seat Wiltern Theatre and the 6,000-capacity Greek Theatre
and Universal Amphitheatre.</TE>
<TE>   "Especially in a market the size of L.A.," Bongiovanni says,
"there should be a lot of artists who in other cities might play
2,000-seat theaters that can do 3,500 seats in L.A., and then step up
from there to something like the Universal Amphitheatre.</TE>
<TE>   "We held our annual concert industry awards there on Feb. 9,"
Bongiovanni says, "and the buzz was really positive."</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, a 3,500-seat house is gargantuan in the world of
theater, severely limiting the number of shows likely to fill it for
extended runs.</TE>
<TE>   Kodak Theatre Lacks</TE>
<TE>   a Subscriber Base</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a touring stage version of "The Full Monty" will play the
Ahmanson Theatre next month instead of the originally announced
Kodak, as the show's producers cited both the Ahmanson's smaller
size--2,200 seats--as well as the Ahmanson's 35,000-strong subscriber
base the Kodak lacks.</TE>
<TE>   "For shows that want an intimate feel, that may not be best
choice," Sorce says. "But something like 'Dreamgirls,' 'Phantom of
the Opera' or 'Les Miserables' could do very, very well in a house
like that, and be able to take advantage of its unusual architectural
design.</TE>
<TE>   "You also have to consider how the theater fits into the design
element of the show: Does the particular size and shape of the
theater dovetail with the design element of that type of project? I
would say [for the Kodak] that's probably a minority of shows."</TE>
<TE>   As for any sound problems, few in or out of the theater expect
them to continue once performers and their sound crews get used to
it.</TE>
<TE>   "Think how long it takes you to learn a new word processor and
cube it," acoustician Mahoney says. "But even as people are learning
the capabilities of a new theater, it's like you've got someone
looking over your shoulder when you're using that word processor for
the first time....But that's the thrill of being in the performing
arts. You've got to roll with the punches."</TE>

<KH>THE OSCARS</KH>
<HD>No Longer Just Spectacle Hair</HD>
<DH>Outlandish styles have had better chances of being noticed,
but voting changes are giving more subtle creations their due.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL MALLORY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If a movie were made about this year's nomination procedure for the
Academy Award for best makeup, it might be titled "The Hairdressers
Strike Back."</LD>
<LD>   Over the category's 20-year history, voters have leaned toward
spectacle--creature work, fantasy or horror effects, and aging jobs.
The nomination for "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the
Ring" follows that tradition, as does the one for the meticulous
aging of Russell Crowe for "A Beautiful Mind."</LD>
<LD>   Several other seemingly obvious contenders, such as "Planet of the
Apes," "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," "A.I." and "Hannibal"
have been ignored in favor of "Moulin Rouge."</LD>
<TE>   The difference seems to turn on hair.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be there weren't that many makeup and hair people in
the academy," says "A Beautiful Mind" nominee Greg Cannom. "The
meeting for the final nominations, it used to be made up of
directors, art directors, actors, all different people. Now ... only
the makeup and hair artists vote, and more of the subtler, artsy
films are getting nominated."</TE>
<TE>   A recent change also limits nominees to two per film. Whereas in
previous years makeup nominees would likely include the makeup
designer, the key applicator of the makeup and possibly the
hairdresser, hairstylists are now on equal footing.</TE>
<TE>   The nominating committee "will ask, 'Would you have considered
nominating this film without hair?'" says hairstylist Colleen
Callaghan, who is nominated for "A Beautiful Mind." "If they say yes,
then the hairdresser is not included, and it is the top makeup
people. If they say no, the hairdresser is included."</TE>
<TE>   Hairdressers welcome the inclusion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about time," says hairstylist Aldo Signoretti, nominated for
"Moulin Rouge." "I'm very proud that people have started to notice
the wigs and that we are part of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Cannom, who has seven previous nominations and two wins ("Bram
Stoker's Dracula" [1992] and "Bicentennial Man" [1999]) has become
known as an aging specialist, primarily through his improvements on
silicone-filled prosthetic appliances, which are glued to an actor's
face.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, appliances have been molded in foam rubber, which
Cannom says looks less realistic and breaks down faster than
silicone, but baked silicone gel is ordinarily too slippery to hold
makeup. Working with makeup technician Wes Wofford, Cannom developed
his own formula for an outer skin for his silicone pieces that takes
the makeup.</TE>
<TE>   Crowe's makeup covered nine stages of middle and old age, and in
each Cannom tried to include touches of the real John Forbes Nash Jr.
"I used very small appliances on Russell's face," he says. "I didn't
want to widen his face at all, because the real Nash has a very long,
narrow face." Cannom also took care not to duplicate his work on
Crowe for "The Insider."</TE>
<TE>   Cannom may have turned Crowe into a senior citizen, but Callaghan,
a former Broadway actress and nominee for 1995's "Roommates," was
responsible for taking the actor back to his 20s, with a short, 1940s
hairstyle.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge of having the principal characters' hair reflect the
proper time period was aided by director Ron Howard's decision to
shoot the film largely in sequence, Callaghan says. Having cut
Crowe's hair short for the start of filming, she let nature take its
course, using wigs only in "that 15-year montage where he went into
the bald cap."</TE>
<TE>   For Connelly, who declined to cut her long hair for the film,
Callaghan styled it for the era. "In the '50s they didn't have blow
dryers and rollers," she says. "I told Ron and Todd [Hallowell, the
executive producer] that, if you really want a '50s look, it has to
be done the way we did it then, with a wet set and reversed rows of
pin curls. When they saw it, they said, 'That's it, do it!' And
sometimes, they wanted to eat their words when it went on for hours"
in additional makeup time.</TE>
<TE>   "Moulin Rouge" was an even bigger hair show, with
Signoretti--nominated with makeup artist Maurizio Silvi--providing
wigs for practically the entire cast, including best actress nominee
Nicole Kidman. Signoretti, who is based in Italy, is amused to hear
that most people thought Kidman's flowing red hair was her own.
"That's the whole trick," he chuckles.</TE>
<TE>   Signoretti, also a first-time nominee, adopted a painterly color
scheme. "I don't want to say that everything is based on
Toulouse-Lautrec, but most of it is, yes," he says. In particular, he
exploited the color of the film's title. "Baz [Luhrmann] said, 'What,
another red?' I kept saying, 'This is Moulin Rouge.'"</TE>
<TE>   Silvi also looked to the Impressionist painters for inspiration in
creating the makeup (which, save for a discreet prosthetic nose on
John Leguizamo, playing Toulouse-Lautrec, were more theatrical), and
did not worry about staying slavishly devoted to time period.</TE>
<TE>   "The anachronistic nature of this film allowed me to go beyond the
time, so that I imagined Satine [Kidman's character] as a 'Gilda' fin
de siecle," Silvi says, referring to the 1946 film with Rita
Hayworth.</TE>
<TE>   The "Moulin Rouge" team also took a time-consuming, if not
old-fashioned, approach to the facial hair, from Ewan McGregor's
beard to the luxurious orange moustache worn by Jim Broadbent.</TE>
<TE>   "It was laid on hair-by-hair, and was painstaking in its
perfection," Broadbent says. "But I was prepared to go through the
hour to hour-and-a-half it took, for without it I wouldn't have had a
character."</TE>
<TE>   Usually a false mustache or beard is created by tying hairs
individually onto thin, loose netting called lace, then glued onto
the face in large pieces. But Broadbent declares, "There is no lace
with the Italians!"</TE>
<TE>   For "The Lord of the Rings," nominee Peter Owen and a staff of 10
spent 31/2 years just creating wigs. Makeup designer Richard Taylor
notes "there were only two people in the film that were out of wigs,
and those were the two children listening to Bilbo's story at the
Hobbit party." The kids, incidentally, are the children of
co-writer/director/co-producer Peter Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor and Jackson are partners in Weta, a New Zealand-based film
services company that not only provided the makeup for "Rings" but
also the digital and creature work, props, armor and costumes. As a
result, Taylor is nominated in three separate categories--makeup,
costume and visual effects--the first time a craft or technical
artist has garnered three nominations for a single film. (Jackson is
similarly nominated in three above-the-line categories--producing,
directing and writing--but there are precedents for that.)</TE>
<TE>   A list of makeup statistics for the film is similarly impressive:
10,000 separate facial appliances, 1,800 sets of full body
prosthetics and 1,800 pairs of Hobbit feet were created over the
course of the 15-month shoot on the three films depicting the entire
"Rings" saga. Beyond the spectacle, Taylor hopes people appreciate
the more subtle makeup effects.</TE>
<TE>   "The aging makeup on Bilbo, who ages from 45 to 170 over the three
films, is very beautiful and subtle," he says. "And there was very
subtle silicone and gelatin work done to augment the faces of the
lead actors every single day of the shoot."</TE>
<TE>   Gelatin appliances were used for the pointy ear tips on all the
Hobbit characters and for the false noses worn by Ian McKellen and
Christopher Lee, which kept the actors' features from disappearing
beneath voluminous beards.</TE>
<TE>   One of "Ring's" biggest makeup challenges was the oversized, hairy
Hobbit feet. After much experimentation, the problem of creating
realistic looking feet that would adhere to the actors own and would
withstand being walked in for hours, was solved by injecting
different densities of foam rubber it into the molds.</TE>
<TE>   The first several sets, Taylor says, were trashed when the actors
staged soccer games in between shots.</TE>
<TE>   "But when we showed them the tens of hours of work and the trouble
it took to make just one pair, never mind 1,800 pair," he says. "The
guys totally understood and took it upon themselves to look after
them."</TE>

<HD>Tracking the Parallel Rise of Trains, Photography</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Easy-to-use cameras and passenger train travel were born at the same
time. Around the middle of the 19th century, these modern inventions
compelled people to live a little faster and go a little farther than
they used to.</LD>
<LD>   Traveling three times the speed of horses and buggies, early
steam-driven trains caused the distances between cities to shrink.
Likewise, photographs brought faraway places into people's homes.
They also defied time. Moving faster than the eye, a camera's shutter
froze fleeting moments, allowing viewers to see the world in ways
never before possible.</LD>
<LD>   At the Getty Center, "Railroad Vision" explores the experiential
links between photography and trains. Bringing together 90
photographs made between 1855 and 2000, it begins as a
straightforward account of the mutually beneficial relationship that
grew up between photographers and the railroad industry, at a time
when the popularity (and profitability) of both were surging.</LD>
<TE>   Photographers who were interested in up-to-the-minute technology
and design were naturally drawn to the engineering marvels of trains,
tracks, trestles and tunnels. Railroad companies in the United States
and government agencies in the United Kingdom and France knew a good
thing when they saw it. Many turned to cameramen to advertise their
businesses and the services they provided, not least of which was
tourism.</TE>
<TE>   The first three of the exhibition's four galleries outline the
love affair between the lens and the railroad. A microcosm of the
show as a whole, the first one features formal portraits of engines
that have just rolled off the factory floor, their polished
mechanisms glistening in the sun. The locomotives in these albumen
prints by John Stuart, James Mudd and an unknown photographer are so
pristine that they seem to be perfectly scaled toys.</TE>
<TE>   More candid pictures follow, including A.J. Russell's group
portrait of passengers and employees gathered around an engine that
has been decorated with an enormous elk's antlers. Action-packed
shots by Alfred A. Hart look as if they could be movie stills.
Printed on card stock for stereographic viewing devices, they appear
to have been made while the photographer clung to a smokestack or
dangled from the roof of a tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   Two train wrecks complete the display. In one, an engine tows a
line of damaged locomotives back for repair or disposal. In another,
a Chas. Minot engine lies upside down in a ditch, destroyed by the
Confederate cavalry. The devastation is all the more shocking for its
presence amid the excited optimism of the other images.</TE>
<TE>   The next gallery focuses on the tracks that began to crisscross
the United States and Europe. In general, American photographers
depicted railways as just another element in a vast landscape.
Alexander Gardner's "Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way"
mocks the pretensions of a series of Thomas Cole paintings. Those
paintings celebrate the grandiose ideals of Manifest Destiny, while
Gardner's photos zero in on the dirt and tedium of laboring in the
middle of nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   By turns sublime and boring, threatening and thrilling, early
train journeys were filled with ambivalent emotions and contradictory
meanings. No photograph better captures the rationality and madness
of linking the continent by rail than William Henry Jackson's "'The
Loop' near Georgetown, Colorado." This bird's-eye view of a track
that snakes its way up several mountain valleys, eventually doubling
back to make a gigantic loop, gives amazing form to the Sisyphean
labor and boyish delight of building railroads. It also suggests that
half the fun of going somewhere is getting there.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the European photographers tend to zero in on single
structures, treating bridges and buildings as sculptures that stand
apart from their surroundings. Hippolyte-Auguste Collard's image of a
roundhouse's sky-lighted interior makes the French railway system
appear to be a giant Swiss watch, whose efficient beauty is endowed
with religious transcendence. Edouard Baldus' photo of a tidy station
in Toulon celebrates balance, proportion and exquisite civility.</TE>
<TE>   In a more adventuresome spirit, Juan Laurent and Louis-Emile
Durandelle positioned their tripods between the rails. Their dead-on
close-ups of steel bridges transform these geometric trestles into
formal compositions that have the bold presence of Minimalist
sculptures. Many other prints by unknown photographers depict bridges
under construction, revealing an interest in nuts-and-bolts
engineering.</TE>
<TE>   The third gallery features the largest photographs, works by
William Henry Jackson and William H. Rau, who both worked for the
railroads. Jackson's images of trains chugging through mountain
passes and around precipitous ravines define the drama of tourism.
They are just what you'd expect of first-rate promotional imagery:
vividly detailed and downright unbelievable.</TE>
<TE>   Rau's photographs are also unbelievable, but for entirely
different reasons. They portray vast stretches of Pennsylvania's
countryside, every square inch of which has been dug up, sorted and
prepared for speedy shipping by the coal-mining industry. These
handsomely composed and lovingly printed works are at odds with their
blunt, ugly subjects.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth gallery, everything changes. All of its works date
from the 20th century, when railroads no longer represented the
cutting edge of transportation technology and photography had become
an art.</TE>
<TE>   In the previous galleries, all of the prints documented the
visible world, recording what happened at a particular time and
place. In contrast, the final gallery displays works of art,
multilayered creations that serve diverse, more hard-to-define
purposes.</TE>
<TE>   One of the differences is material. Aside from a single etched
photogravure (Alfred Stieglitz's masterpiece "The Hand of Man") and a
pair of color prints (a hauntingly banal intersection by William
Eggleston and a nostalgic interior by Jim Dow), all of the 20th
century images are gelatin silver prints as opposed to those from the
19th century, which used egg--albumen--coated paper. Intense clarity
and sensuousness characterize this medium, which allows for greater
experimentation with contrasts, depth and texture.</TE>
<TE>   Classic photographs by Walker Evans, Brassai, August Sander, Franz
Roh and Edmund Teske hang alongside works by O. Winston Link, whose
crowd-pleasing pictures of trains speeding by at night are at once
hokey and surreal. In many of the images that fill the fourth
gallery, people play an increasingly important role, displacing
trains, tracks and trestles as the stars of the show.</TE>

<HD>'Making Marines' Chronicles Recruits' Survival of Boot Camp</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An axiom in military circles holds that the Army and Navy are run
like traditional armed forces, the Air Force is like a corporation,
and the Marine Corps is something entirely different.</LD>
<LD>   The Marine Corps, the saying goes, is a religion.</LD>
<LD>   "Making Marines," which can be seen Sunday on the Discovery
Channel, provides an unusually intimate look at the grueling set of
physical and mental challenges that novices undergo to gain
acceptance into the faith.</LD>
<TE>   Veteran filmmaker Chuck Braverman, and his son, Alex, a film
student at New York University, were given access to recruits at
Marine boot camp at Parris Island, S.C., before, during and after
their 12-week transformation.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a marvelously detailed, engrossing account of how
Marine recruits are trained and what kind of young Americans are
drawn to the Marine Corps and its devotion to "honor, courage and
commitment."</TE>
<TE>   Forget those "reality" series where waitresses and stockbrokers
jet to some remote locale to be tested in some network-contrived
competition. Parris Island is the real deal and there are no
million-dollar endorsement contracts awaiting the survivors.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the male and female recruits in "Making Marines" will
succeed, despite moments of exhaustion, confusion and despair. Some
will drop out. At least one will be dismissed for having used
marijuana before arriving at boot camp.</TE>
<TE>   The triumph of "Making Marines" is that it makes us care about the
hopes and struggles of the recruits: the dyed blond from Detroit, the
fresh-faced twins from Georgia, the 19-year-old who misses his
girlfriend in Tennessee, the thoughtful musician from Long Island,
the immigrant from the Ukraine, and others.</TE>
<TE>   "Making Marines" is also populated with drill instructors, those
leather-lunged, over-the-top sergeants who are tormentors and mentors
to the recruits.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary notes that for many of the recruits, military
service is an escape from a future of minimum-wage boredom.</TE>
<TE>   "You know another reason I joined?" asks Jessica Moss from rural
Tennessee. "Because I worked at McDonald's. That was like: 'OK, I'm
not doing this the rest of my life. I'm doing something.'"</TE>
<TE>   Recruits are encouraged to attend chapel. For many, introduction
into a new faith has brought them closer to an older one.</TE>
<TE>   "Boot camp has made me religious," Moss said. "I know lots of
times I thought, 'Please, God, get me through this.'"</TE>
<TE>   "Making Marines" airs 8-11 p.m. Sunday on the Discovery Channel.</TE>

<HD>Anvils, Cartoons' Answer to Oscars</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Splashy music, schmaltzy tributes, rambling speeches from
two-dimensional characters.</LD>
<LD>   Yep, it's Oscar weekend, but think of this as a warmup for
Sunday's extravaganza: The Cartoon Network presents a slightly
tongue-in-cheek praise-fest of its own tonight at 7, the "1st 13th
Annual Fancy Anvil Award Show Program Special ... Live! ... In
Stereo."</LD>
<LD>   Part Hollywood sendup and part promotional vehicle for the Cartoon
Network, the pre-produced show has its amusing moments, although much
of the inside humor might be lost on newcomers to the network.</LD>
<TE>   Host Johnny Bravo and other animated presenters schmooze onstage
with real celebrities, "Roger Rabbit" style, as classic cartoons
compete with the network's new shows for prizes recently voted on by
viewers.</TE>
<TE>   The format might raise a few eyebrows among purists from the older
demographic. The best cartoon category, for example, pits the Bugs
Bunny-Elmer Fudd classic "What's Opera Doc?" against such nominees as
an episode of "The Powerpuff Girls."</TE>
<TE>   High points include a salute to lifetime achievement winner
Scooby-Doo, with commentary from a droll-as-ever Tim Conway; a
revved-up Robin Williams introducing one of the nominees; and a gag
that has Plank, the scrap of wood from "Ed, Edd and Eddy," stoically
and silently accepting his award for best performance by an inanimate
object in a dramatic role.</TE>
<TE>   Best of all, tonight the musical numbers are nice and short.</TE>

<HD>Off-Broadway Crowds Still Off</HD>
<DH>Theater* Big venues are setting attendance records but
smaller ones, many that struggled even before Sept. 11, are
scrambling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALINA TUGEND</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>While Broadway theaters seem to be bouncing back from the severe drop
in business after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many smaller
off-Broadway venues continue to scramble to lure back audiences.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this month, Broadway theaters reported that they were
setting box-office records, with revenue and attendance up compared
with last year, according to the League of American Theaters and
Producers, a commercial trade organization for Broadway.</LD>
<LD>   However, the hundreds of off-Broadway theaters, many located in
the devastated downtown area near the World Trade Center--parts of
which were closed for nearly two weeks after the attacks--are finding
that too many seats remain empty.</LD>
<TE>   In an effort to turn that around, many off- and off-off-Broadway
theaters have banded together to help one another recover emotionally
and financially. They also are relying on emergency funding made
available after Sept. 11 to prop up New York City's arts world.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been roiled by the financial impact of the attacks,"
David Aukin, artistic director for the Soho Rep, says in a report
about the economic effects of Sept. 11 on small theaters. "At the
best of times, we operate without much of a safety net. These are not
the best of times."</TE>
<TE>   Many off-Broadway theaters, for which a few weeks of lost ticket
sales can be financially devastating, are looking for creative ways
to assure their audiences that they are still alive.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for example, Repertorio Espanol, a downtown theater that
performs only in Spanish. The 34-year-old theater company, winner of
four Obies--the off-Broadway equivalent of the Tony--was shut down in
the first few weeks after the attacks. But even when the downtown
area opened again, ticket sales were down by half. Traveling in the
city was a logistical nightmare. Actors flying in from Colombia,
Argentina and other Latin American countries, afraid to come to New
York, canceled their engagements.</TE>
<TE>   And, most importantly, the school groups, which make up about
one-third of their matinee audiences, stopped coming altogether
because many school districts in New York and the surrounding states
banned school travel after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "We basically went from our best year to our worst year on Sept.
11," says Robert Frederico, artistic associate producer for the
Repertorio Espanol.</TE>
<TE>   So, the company decided to change the way it operates. If the
schools wouldn't come to them, they would go to the schools. "We set
up 'Repertorio on the Go,'" Frederico says. "We took our boombox and
went anywhere within 90 miles of the city. There's no lighting, no
sound equipment--we'll perform under any conditions just so students
can enjoy live performances. We didn't want them to get in the habit
of not including live theater in their curriculum."</TE>
<TE>   Other off-Broadway theater companies formed Downtown NYC!, a
coalition of downtown theaters, dance companies, art galleries and
other small business.</TE>
<TE>   "Initially it was set up for a bit of therapy," Scott Morfee,
producer of the comedy/drama "Underneath the Lintel" at the Soho
Playhouse, says of Downtown NYC! "But it's also to boost business and
spirits."</TE>
<TE>   The group organized a December sing-along in Washington Square
Park with singer Petula Clark and "about 85% of the casts from
theaters south of 28th Street," says Morfee, who helped found the
coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown NYC! recently completed a "snapshot survey" of 45
downtown businesses and found that 21 of the 45 businesses were
forced to lay off people after Sept. 11; 95% reported a loss of
business. The coalition plans additional surveys to more accurately
ascertain the economic and job losses to the downtown community, as
well as to attempt to separate the effect of the attacks from the
impact of the general economic downturn.</TE>
<TE>   According to a report issued by the Alliance of Resident Theaters,
which represents about 400 not-for-profit theaters in New York, the
projected loss of income in 2002 to its members--which include
theaters ranging from Lincoln Center and the Roundabout Theater
Company to smaller ones like the Bat and the Labyrinth Theater
Companies--will come to $16.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Collectively, theaters lost $5 million in the first month after
the attacks, the report states. "In an industry generating $140
million annually, $5 million may not at first seem terribly
significant," the report says, "but for theaters operating on very
tight margins, without the safety net of cash reserves and
endowments, two days to two weeks' lost income can make the paying of
staff and rent difficult. Indeed, the survival of several smaller
downtown theaters, which were disproportionately affected by the
disaster, is in doubt."</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Louloudes, executive director of the Alliance of Resident
Theaters, acknowledges it is difficult to attribute the difficulties
small theaters are facing solely to Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "No doubt we were heading into a recession before 9/11," she says.
But, she notes, there's also no question that the terrorist attacks
and their aftermath--including anthrax scares and security alerts,
which made people hesitant to travel into Manhattan--exacerbated the
economic downturn.</TE>
<TE>   Louloudes' organization was charged with distributing $2.65
million donated by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to help
not-for-profit theaters recover from Sept. 11. Similar grants were
made to arts and music organizations.</TE>
<TE>   On March 8, the alliance announced that 111 theaters had received
$2 million in awards from the Mellon money. The remaining funds will
be distributed next month. A common thread among those applying for
aid, Louloudes says, was "a tremendous drop in subscription
revenues."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, many theaters put off their fund-raising promotions
out of concern that asking for money for entertainment after the
attacks would look crass, Louloudes says. "We had to do a workshop in
October called 'What Do You Mean You're Not Fund-raising?'" she says.
"We told them they shouldn't be ashamed to ask for money."</TE>
<TE>   Morfee's play, "Underneath the Lintel," was initially scheduled to
open Sept. 18. Instead, it opened for one week on Sept. 19 offering
audiences--primarily locals--free or "pay what you can" tickets.</TE>
<TE>   "We did it for ourselves and for people in the neighborhood who
are always supportive of us, but there was no way to sustain an
audience," Morfee says. So he closed the play, officially reopened it
on Oct. 23 and laboriously rebuilt attendance.</TE>
<TE>   Ticket sales are now going well, he says, but more people than
usual are buying tickets on the spot rather than weeks in advance.
"That's not typical at all," he says, noting that after Sept. 11,
people seem much more hesitant to plan ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Even Broadway theatergoers are avoiding buying far ahead of time,
says Armetta Haubner, communications director for the League of
American Theaters and Producers.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole way people buy tickets has changed since Sept. 11,"
Haubner says. Before the attacks, she says, most people bought at
least six weeks in advance. But a survey completed in December found
that more than 50% of tickets were purchased one to three days before
the play.</TE>
<TE>   One off-Broadway commercial theater, the Flea--located in the
badly damaged southern tip of Manhattan--had its best week ever right
before Sept. 11. After the attacks, the theater closed for a month
and then reopened at 5% capacity, says associate producer Erik
Sniedze.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's doing booming business. The theater, which has one
80-seat and one 40-seat auditorium, showed "The Guys," the first play
to directly address the terrorist attacks. The play sold out, due not
in small part to the celebrity two-member cast. Sigourney Weaver,
whose husband, Jim Simpson, owns the Flea, first starred in the
production with Bill Murray; Susan Sarandon and Anthony LaPaglia
later took over the roles.</TE>
<TE>   The Flea's next play will have nothing to do with Sept. 11,
Sniedze says. And he says that although he greatly appreciates
efforts to boost the downtown theaters' morale and finances, "it's
time to focus back on individual institutions. That helps us more
than a collective effort and constantly going to meetings."</TE>
<TE>   Even the more established plays in smaller downtown theaters, such
as "Stomp" at the Orpheum, which has been playing for nine years,
have experienced an audience downturn.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw a fall-off of 70% in the first six weeks after the
attacks," says producer Marc Roth. Roth, who is also president of the
League of Off-Broadway Theaters and Producers, says sales for "Stomp"
are up from a few months ago but still 10% to 15% off projections
from last year.</TE>
<TE>   For off-Broadway theaters, the focus is now on the future: on
fund-raising drives and on efforts to have a say in the role theater
will play in a new downtown Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   Louloudes sits on a subcommittee of the Lower Manhattan
Development Corp., which was set up by New York Gov. George Pataki
after the attacks. One of her goals is to ensure that any
construction in Lower Manhattan includes performance space and
subsidies for not-for-profit theaters.</TE>
<TE>   It is important, Morfee says, that people realize the survival of
small theaters can mean the survival of many other businesses in the
area.</TE>
<TE>   Since off-Broadway theaters tend to be scattered in differ- ent
neighborhoods--rather than clumped together as on Broadway--the
success or failure of a show can mean the success or failure of
surrounding restaurants and shops.</TE>
<TE>   "Theaters are good anchors in neighborhoods," he says. "One little
theater has so much impact on a street."</TE>

<HD>Academy Voters Feel the Heat of Campaign Fever</HD>
<DH>Casting award ballots can be a subjective, haphazard and
frazzled process, with this year's stepped-up studio publicity wars
adding to the pressure.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack Smight is a man under siege.</LD>
<LD>   The 75-year-old retired director sighs as he displays the stacks
of 62 movies on tape and DVD that arrived steadily for weeks on the
doorstep of his Valencia home.</LD>
<LD>   In another room, he points to the shelves near his stereo system
that are now lined with free movie soundtracks shipped by anxious
studios. And, if that weren't enough, screenplays for films like "A
Beautiful Mind," "In the Bedroom" and "Gosford Park" have dropped
into his mailbox with generous regularity.</LD>
<TE>   "Pretty soon, they all meld into one," the soft-spoken director of
the 1966 Paul Newman film "Harper" says with frustration. "I love
films, but to have to sit down every night and look at one or two and
make notes, it's not always a pleasant situation."</TE>
<TE>   But wade through them he must, for Smight is an Oscar voter.</TE>
<TE>   This year, more than ever, Hollywood studios have waged
multimillion-dollar ad campaigns and sent nominees fanning out on the
publicity circuit to woo the 5,739 voting members of the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhat overwhelmed but dutiful, the voters, who are less
frequently heard from, have quietly gone about their time-consuming
and often thankless task of selecting the winners who will be
announced Sunday at the 74th Academy Awards.</TE>
<TE>   Toss out any notion that this is an objective, well-oiled process.
The academy itself concedes that studios have bent some of the rules
to flog their films.</TE>
<TE>   Screenwriter and director Dale Launer, whose writing credits
include "My Cousin Vinny," said he takes his Oscar voting as
seriously as the next person, but he admits he won't spend more than
a couple of minutes watching a movie on his VCR if he thinks it's a
stinker.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you get something in," Launer said, "and it's for best
picture consideration and you just say something like, 'Yeah, in your
dreams!'"</TE>
<TE>   Cinematographer John Hora, whose credits include "Gremlins," won't
vote on any category for which he doesn't see a majority of movies
with nominations.</TE>
<TE>   This year, he said, he voted for the one category he felt most
comfortable about--best cinematography--leaving blank everything else
on his final ballot, including the best picture category with
nominees "A Beautiful Mind," "In the Bedroom," "Gosford Park,"
"Moulin Rouge" and "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the
Ring."</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen 'Moulin Rouge' three times, but I always fall asleep,"
Hora said. "I saw 'Lord of the Rings' both [in the theater and on
DVD]. I liked the first hour, and then I don't care for it much. The
effects looked better on DVD."</TE>
<TE>   The truth is, voting for the Academy Awards is a highly
subjective, sometimes haphazard and occasionally frazzled process.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews with a small cross-section of Oscar voters, they
complained that they often lack the expertise to vote in categories
outside their professions.</TE>
<TE>   Many are so busy making a living in a business in which 18-hour
days are common that they don't have time to watch all the movies.
And they often end up voting as much with their hearts as with their
minds, influenced, they admit, by friendships and industry buzz but
not by the screaming four-color advertisements that incessantly
target them.</TE>
<TE>   In its own way, the Oscar voting process is as confusing as a Palm
Beach County butterfly ballot.</TE>
<TE>   During the nominating process, the academy's actors branch votes
on the acting categories, the directors branch on the directors, the
writers on the writers and so on. The five best picture nominees are
selected by the entire voting membership.</TE>
<TE>   The final ballots are then mailed to all voting members, who this
year were required to return them no later than 5 p.m. Tuesday so
that PricewaterhouseCoopers could begin tabulating them. When it
comes to the final ballot, members vote in all categories, except for
foreign-language film, documentaries and short films (in those
categories voters cast ballots only after seeing an official
screening).</TE>
<TE>   The academy does try to give Oscar voters a little guidance. When
they first become academy members, they receive a pamphlet that
includes tips from experts on judging various categories. Each year,
the academy also slips a note in with the final ballot telling voters
that it's OK to leave some categories blank if they prefer.</TE>
<TE>   For people not skilled in a craft, the technical categories can
cause them to throw up their hands. How does one judge best sound? Or
best editing? Or best musical score? In many ways, the voters aren't
so different from the average, passionate but less than fully
schooled member of the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Hairstylist Barbara Lorenz, who recently worked on the sci-fi film
"The Time Machine," faced that problem when she watched "Memento,"
director Christopher Nolan's quirky murder mystery told backward. The
film is up for best editing and best original screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard it was very confusing," Lorenz said. "I felt if I left to
go get popcorn and go to the bathroom, I'd miss out on something. It
was kind of difficult for me to pay attention because it was
backward. When I left, I said, 'Who the hell killed her?'"</TE>
<TE>   Christina Smith, the makeup supervisor on such films as
"Schindler's List" and "Hook," noted that best sound is always a
tough one for her to judge.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what good sound is, but I'm not an expert on it," Smith
said. "I usually talk to a soundman [and ask], 'What is the best
sound?'"</TE>
<TE>   In her own field, Smith just wishes that more academy voters
understood what goes into an Oscar-worthy endeavor.</TE>
<TE>   "If you do a job so well they don't know it's makeup," Smith said.
"Our peer group understands that, but I don't know that the entire
academy understands."</TE>
<TE>   The academy has, over the years, taken steps to limit the outside
influence on its voters. Rules have been adopted that prohibit
studios from wining and dining voters, telephoning them at home or
sending them tapes packaged in ornate gift boxes.</TE>
<TE>   Voter Was Invited to</TE>
<TE>   'Moulin Rouge' Party</TE>
<TE>   The academy has put studios on notice that any attempt to
influence Oscar voters will be dealt with harshly--from withholding
Academy Award tickets to eliminating a film from competition, a
draconian step that has never been taken.</TE>
<TE>   But the reality remains that in Hollywood, where everyone seems to
know everybody else, Oscar voters often get invited to dinner parties
or private screenings where a director or a star might just be on
hand to chat and answer questions.</TE>
<TE>   Screenwriter Launer recalls receiving an invitation this year to a
Jan. 17 party at Le Dome in West Hollywood that was hosted by actor
Michael York and his wife. The invitation was to celebrate the "six
Golden Globe nominations and DVD release" of "Moulin Rouge." Director
Baz Luhrmann was in attendance.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Launer said, he was wrestling with whether to vote
for Luhrmann for the Directors Guild of America's top feature film
award or Peter Jackson for "The Lord of the Rings."</TE>
<TE>   "It was fun; [Luhrmann] is a nice guy," Launer said. "Peter
Jackson did a great job in 'The Lord of the Rings.' What a
sensational movie. It was consistent all the way through. Sweeping
cameras [just like] 'Moulin Rouge.' So, who do I vote for?"</TE>
<TE>   Launer paused and, hinting he eventually voted for Luhrmann, said:
"Now, had I gone to a party and met Peter and he was just as nice ...
?"</TE>
<TE>   In seeking out Oscar, studios and their publicity machines have
turned actors and directors into virtual politicians, sending them
out to press the flesh with anyone who might remotely cast a ballot.</TE>
<TE>   One favorite place for Oscar candidates to show up is the Motion
Picture and Television Fund's retirement home in Woodland Hills. This
Oscar season saw directors Ron Howard, Jackson and Luhrmann as well
as actors Michelle Pfeiffer and Billy Bob Thornton making appearances
before the retirees. Luhrmann made several visits, sources say.</TE>
<TE>   But academy Executive Director Bruce Davis said stars and
directors are wasting their time if they think the retirement home is
a good place to mine Oscar votes.</TE>
<TE>   "I checked two years ago," Davis said, "and do you know how many
votes come out of the motion picture home? Two!"</TE>
<TE>   Chatting with a movie star or A-list director at a party might
occasionally influence a vote, but the real thing they listen to are
recommendations from friends and colleagues urging them to see a
certain movie or performance.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, voters can't escape the buzz about films that circulates
in the Hollywood gossip mill and concede that what people are saying
will whet their curiosity to go see a movie, at the very least.</TE>
<TE>   Animation producer Jane Baer, who has worked on such films as "Who
Framed Roger Rabbit," says that this sort of talk has an effect on
Oscar voters "because you respect the opinions of your peers, and if
they say you've got to go see this great performance, you will. That
affects me, initially, to go see it. I may come out with a totally
different opinion, but not usually."</TE>
<TE>   And what if a friend or colleague is nominated?</TE>
<TE>   "I suppose if your best friend had done a film and it was getting
some buzz and you went to one of these screenings, it would have some
influence," Smight said. "That's the hardest thing now, to be fully
objective about it. In one sense, I'm sort of glad that I've
retired."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, a debate has raged inside the academy over the
power of studio ads to sway Oscar votes. It is estimated that studios
have spent as much as $10 million or more during this year's Oscar
season.</TE>
<TE>   Smight, an academy voter for more than 40 years, said he is "very
upset" every time he picks up the trade newspapers and sees all the
Oscar ads staring him in the face.</TE>
<TE>   "It's incredible," he said. "It's bound to have some kind of
influence [on voters]."</TE>
<TE>   Others scoff at the suggestion that the Oscar ads influence votes.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine anyone being swayed by it," said film editor
Michael Jablow.</TE>
<TE>   Oscar Ads Embarrassing, Says Academy Chief</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to Oscar ads, the academy's Davis is blunt, calling
them embarrassing and adding that "everybody wishes it would just go
away." But he also said that Oscar voters aren't influenced by them.</TE>
<TE>   "The analogy is political advertising," Davis said. "There, I
think, it is generally accepted that ads do have influence in swaying
voters because the wide public doesn't understand much about
politics.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, the audience is the cream of the world's filmmakers. The
idea that a [director like] Curtis Hanson or Martin Scorsese is going
to decide the best director of the year by reading an ad in the trade
papers is just absurd."</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, a new wrinkle in ad campaigning has
surfaced with the studios producing DVDs depicting how their
Oscar-nominated films were made or publishing handsome booklets
showing scenes from the movies.</TE>
<TE>   Ric Robertson, the academy's No. 2 administrative executive, said
it is not permissible for a studio to mail these DVDs directly to
voters. But they circumvent the rule by providing Hollywood's two
major trade publications with a supply for their subscribers, many of
them voters.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to figure out a way to make it a violation of the rules
and look for ways to fix it," Robertson said. "We don't want this to
be a contest of the making of the best film."</TE>
<TE>   While the academy membership includes top actors and filmmakers,
the rank-and-file voter is not necessarily a household name. Nominees
in any category are virtually always invited to join the academy.
Others must be sponsored by two members of their respective branch,
and meet requirements regarding years spent in the industry or having
credits on Oscar-caliber movies.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the academy has been criticized for failing to
recognize diversity when it comes to race, gender and age. One voter
said the joke he hears at academy screenings is that you can't hear
the dialogue for the sound of Medic Alert tags banging against oxygen
tanks.</TE>
<TE>   Davis bristles at this, saying that conclusion is drawn because
voters who attend Oscar screenings at the academy in Beverly Hills
are almost exclusively retired.</TE>
<TE>   The closest the academy comes to defining its voters is to list
them by the branches they belong to. Because the actors branch
constitutes a significant 23% of the voting membership, critics
argue, it is often the tail that wags the dogs when choosing best
picture.</TE>
<TE>   On Academy Awards night, when the accountants from
PricewaterhouseCoopers hand the sealed envelopes to the celebrities
on stage, voters like Jack Smight out in Valencia might argue with
the choices of their fellow academy members, but he certainly
understands what they all went through as judges.</TE>
<TE>   With his wife, Joyce, a former actress, at his side, Smight made
it a point to sit down in front of the TV night after night and take
notes on many of the films he judged.</TE>
<TE>   Is he relieved that the long Oscar season is now almost at an end?</TE>
<TE>   Well, yes, Smight says. But he is also a member of the television
academy, and the Emmy Awards season is just around the corner.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Lawyer Silent 138 Times</HD>
<DH>Courts: Nancy Temple, a key witness, repeatedly asserts 5th
Amendment right during deposition on her role in Enron document
shredding.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID STREITFELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nancy Temple, a lawyer for accounting firm Andersen being quizzed
about her role in the shredding of Enron Corp. documents, cited her
5th Amendment right to keep silent 138 times Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Temple was deposed by lawyers who had filed a class-action suit
against Andersen, which approved Enron's financial statements. In an
unusual move, a federal judge in Houston permitted Temple and eight
other Andersen employees to be questioned much earlier than such a
case would normally allow.</LD>
<LD>   "We were just trying to find out if someone would tell us who
ordered the destruction, who knew about it, precisely what the
process was and what documents were destroyed," said Trey Davis, a
spokesman for the University of California Board of Regents, the lead
plaintiff in the class action.</LD>
<TE>   Lawyers in the case said they had anticipated Temple's refusal to
answer all substantive questions. She is a key figure in the case
because she sent an e-mail from Andersen's Chicago headquarters to
the Enron team in the Houston office Oct. 12, reminding them of the
accountant's policy on document destruction. Only essential material
should be saved, Temple wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty clear from the context and the wording of her e-mail
that she has considerable [legal] exposure," said Eli Gottesdiener, a
Washington lawyer representing Enron employees who lost money in
their retirement accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "Her taking the Fifth is a mixed blessing for us," Gottesdiener
said. "A judge or jury can draw what's called an 'adverse inference'
from someone taking the Fifth. On the other hand, we didn't get to
hear what she had to say."</TE>
<TE>   Temple's lawyer, Mark Hansen, said in a statement after the
deposition that his client "has done nothing wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers in the case are privately speculating that Temple is
likely to become a witness in the Justice Department's criminal case
against Andersen on a charge of obstruction of justice.</TE>
<TE>   "The pressure on the Justice Department to get a conviction now,
to come up with a good case, is enormous," said one attorney, who did
not want his name used. "They need to rope in the Chicago office," to
show that the document destruction was not merely an isolated action
by a few auditors but an organized attempt at a cover-up.</TE>

<HD>GE's Turn Under the Microscope</HD>
<DH>Conglomerates: Enron aftershock doesn't spare the
consistently strong firm, whose stock takes hit after a fund manager
questions its debt and financial disclosure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Electric Co. is suddenly the best proof that, in the
post-Enron world, every company's financial dealings are fair game
for intense scrutiny.</LD>
<LD>   For more than a decade, the double-digit gains in GE's quarterly
sales and profit were nearly as predictable as the seasons. With
legendary Chief Executive John F. "Jack" Welch Jr. at the helm, it
seemed the conglomerate could deliver those gains regardless of
recessions, interest rate swings and the myriad acquisitions and
asset sales by which Welch transformed the gigantic company.</LD>
<LD>   It all kept Wall Street cheering and enriched millions of
Americans even if they hadn't bought GE's appliances or signed for
its car loans. They include mutual fund owners, workers with 401(k)
plans and others who have invested in GE's blue-chip stock, which is
among the most widely held, with a total market value of $372
billion, the nation's highest.</LD>
<TE>   But now--a few months after Jeffrey Immelt succeeded Welch as
chairman and CEO--GE's numbers, its financial disclosure and its
enormous borrowing are getting called into question. And not just by
a gadfly, but by the likes of Bill Gross, head of the nation's
biggest bond fund.</TE>
<TE>   Gross also raised questions about exactly how Welch and now Immelt
managed to frequently post numbers that bested Wall Street's
forecasts. In effect, he poked a hole in the legacy that GE's growth
entirely reflected GE's ironfisted approach to cost cutting,
innovation, decentralized bureaucracy and deft acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   The comments by Gross, head of Newport Beach-based Pacific
Investment Management Co., helped knock 6.5% off of GE's stock price
Wednesday and Thursday, erasing $24.4 billion of GE's market value.
But the stock steadied Friday--gaining 42 cents to $37.87 a share on
the New York Stock Exchange--and the Gross flap could end up being a
brief tempest.</TE>
<TE>   "GE is still doing much better than the average company in
corporate America," said Bill Fiala, an analyst at brokerage firm
Edward Jones &amp; Co. in St. Louis. But regardless of Gross' comments,
GE's growth rate is indeed slowing and "GE could be more
straightforward" about its debt activities and its future potential,
Fiala said.</TE>
<TE>   Gross' remarks aren't the only controversy swirling about the
Fairfield, Conn.-based concern. Others have recently chided GE about
its lack of financial disclosure in the wake of the Enron and
Andersen debacles. It's also being criticized for belonging to an
advocacy group that has called for more disclosure by Fannie Mae, the
huge mortgage buyer, even as the spotlight on GE itself is getting
hotter.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the recent disclosure of Welch's extramarital
affair with the former editor of the Harvard Business Review, which
sparked a furor at the publication and was followed by Welch, 66,
ending up in divorce proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   It's all an abrupt change for GE, which spent most of the last 20
years basking in praise. Welch, especially, has been celebrated as
the best manager of his generation because of the way GE and its
stock price had grown.</TE>
<TE>   GE's numbers are indeed staggering. The company last year posted
revenue of $126 billion and, after paying all of its expenses, turned
a profit of $13.7billion. The company employs more than 300,000
people in 100 countries, and its debt carries triple-A ratings.</TE>
<TE>   But Gross said GE--mainly its GE Capital Services unit--was
carrying too much short-term debt and wasn't disclosing enough
details about that debt and other financial matters. The financial
services behemoth accounts for about 40% of the profit at GE, which
also makes plastics, energy power systems and jet engines and owns
the NBC television network.</TE>
<TE>   GE responded by saying it planned to issue more long-term debt to
balance its portfolio, and reiterated its forecast of 2002 earnings
per share of about $1.65 before accounting charges, which would be a
17% gain from last year. It declined to comment about selling
securities to boost earnings. But GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said,
"The strength of our business model [and] the strength of our
products and services are what drive our growth."</TE>
<TE>   The controversy over GE's debt shouldn't take investors' eyes off
GE's history of earning big returns from invested capital, training
managers to stay on top of technological change and keeping its
subsidiaries No. 1 or 2 in their industries, said Noel Tichy, a
University of Michigan professor, former GE manager and coauthor of
the GE book "Control Your Destiny or Someone Else Will."</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, Fiala of Edward Jones said many on Wall Street
remained too optimistic about GE's prospects, noting that analysts'
consensus forecast had GE's per-share earnings growing 15% annually
for the next five years. Fiala said it would be more like 12% a year.</TE>

<HD>Dow Snaps Winning Streak on Glum News</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dow Jones industrial average closed out its first losing week in
more than a month Friday as stocks struggled on disappointing news
from household names McDonald's and Nike.</LD>
<LD>   "The market continues to have underlying skittishness, and it
seems to be stuck," said Marty Cunningham, head of trading for
Charles Schwab &amp; Co. "I don't think you have what you need just yet"
to sustain gains.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow industrials slipped 52.17 points, or 0.5%, to 10,427.67.
The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index lost 4.89 points, or 0.4%, to
1,148.70. The Nasdaq composite index edged down 17.44 points, or
0.9%, to 1,851.39 after rallying briefly early in the day.</LD>
<TE>   Losers outnumbered winners 4 to 3 on Nasdaq and the New York Stock
Exchange on weak volume.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow lost 1.7% for the week, snapping a five-week winning
streak. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.5%, marking its first weekly loss after
three winning weeks. The Nasdaq was down 0.9%.</TE>
<TE>   Negative comments from Salomon Smith Barney on oil field services
companies and broadcasters put a dent in investor enthusiasm, as did
some gloomy news from the telecom sector when Moody's Investors
Service cut its ratings for Lucent Technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Investors also were spooked by what they see as prospects for
higher interest rates this year after the Federal Reserve said
Tuesday that the U.S. economy is growing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a quiet market with low volume, but it seems people are a
little hesitant with the potential for rate hikes coming," said Ahmed
Okumus, manager of the Okumus Opportunity Fund. Higher rates would
put a cap on growth and may curb corporate profits.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's cut Lucent's rating two notches, saying it will suffer a
longer and deeper downturn in demand for its telecom products than
expected. Lucent, the second-most-active stock on the Big Board, fell
20 cents to $4.59.</TE>
<TE>   Widely held McDonald's, a Dow stock, fell $1.05 to $27.65. The
fast-food company said its yearly earnings would probably miss Wall
Street's forecasts as weak economies worldwide hurt sales.</TE>
<TE>   Nike, the world's largest maker of athletic shoes and clothing,
tumbled $3.70, or almost 6%, to $59.50, after some analysts said they
were disappointed in the outlook for Nike's worldwide sales.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of oil field services companies sold off after Salomon
Smith Barney cut ratings on 14 firms, including Baker Hughes and
Schlumberger, saying sharper-than-expected declines in the Western
Hemisphere rig count are likely to push results below forecasts.
Baker Hughes lost $2.55 to $36.75 and Schlumberger shed $2.90 to
$57.15.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon also cut its ratings on broadcasting companies after a
recent run-up in these stocks. They included Clear Channel
Communications, down 65 cents to $52.50.</TE>
<TE>   In the tech sector, Micron Technology fell 61 cents to $33.90
after the maker of computer memory chips reported a loss as it saw
sales decline from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Bond yields bumped up as investors anticipated rate hikes by the
Fed. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 5.40%
from 5.36% Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Gold mining shares rose as the precious metal gained $4.50 an
ounce to $297.30. Newmont Mining rose $1.13 to $26.37.</TE>
<TE>   * The yen fell sharply, capping its biggest weekly loss against
the dollar in three years. The Japanese currency closed at 132.78 to
the dollar, up 0.90 yen.</TE>
<TE>   * Dow member Boeing lost $1.28 to $46.39 after reports that the
Navy and Marine Corps plan to slash by 30% purchases of the Joint
Strike Fighter, made by Lockheed Martin, and Boeing's F-18E/F
fighters. Lockheed was off $1.40 at $56.25.</TE>
<TE>   * Stocks whose performance is tied most directly to the economy
also fell. Aluminum maker Alcoa fell 68 cents to $37.06 and
International Paper, the largest paper maker, lost 90 cents to
$42.27.</TE>

<HD>Oregon Jury Finds Against Philip Morris</HD>
<DH>Courts: Firm is ordered to pay $150 million in damages to a
smoker's heirs in a case involving low-tar cigarettes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the first tobacco case that centered on claims that low-tar
cigarettes are less hazardous, a jury in Portland, Ore., on Friday
ordered Philip Morris to pay $150 million to the heirs of a woman who
died of lung cancer at age 53. It was the second-largest verdict
awarded in an individual smoker case.</LD>
<LD>   After deliberating nearly five days, the Portland panel awarded
the heirs of Michelle Schwarz $168,000 in compensatory damages.
However, the panel hammered the world's largest cigarette company
with a punitive-damage award of $115 million for fraud, as well as
$25 million for negligence and $10 million for strict liability for
marketing a defective and unreasonably dangerous product.</LD>
<LD>   Philip Morris immediately announced that it would challenge the
verdict on several grounds. The verdict was "inconsistent with the
law and with the facts of the case," said William S. Ohlemeyer, vice
president and associate general counsel at Philip Morris.</LD>
<TE>   "This verdict was more of a general referendum on what the jury
thought of Philip Morris than on the facts of this case.... The court
did not require the jury to connect the conduct of Philip Morris to
Michelle Schwarz in a way the law requires it to be connected in
order to return a verdict like this," Ohlemeyer said.</TE>
<TE>   During the six-week trial, the plaintiffs' lawyers emphasized that
Schwarz had switched from Benson &amp; Hedges to Merit, a Philip Morris
brand marketed as having lower tar and nicotine.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors were asked to answer a series of questions on the verdict
form. Question 13 was the most crucial, according to plaintiffs'
attorney Chuck Tauman. It asked:</TE>
<TE>   "Did Philip Morris make representations that 'low tar' cigarettes
delivered less tar and nicotine to the smoker and were ... safer and
healthier than regular cigarettes and an alternative to quitting
smoking upon which Michelle Schwarz reasonably relied, and if so,
were such false representations and reliance a cause of Michelle
Schwarz's death?"</TE>
<TE>   Ten jurors answered yes and two answered no. For the plaintiff to
prevail in a civil trial in Oregon, the plaintiff must get nine or
more votes.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the punch line to the case," Tauman said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We introduced evidence showing that Philip Morris knew as early
as the 1960s that when you reduce the tar in a cigarette you also
reduce the nicotine. Nicotine is why people smoke, and in order to
get the same amount of nicotine they got from their regular
cigarettes, they would smoke more cigarettes or puffed more deeply,"
to their detriment, Tauman said.</TE>
<TE>   In November, the National Cancer Institute released a
comprehensive study saying that popular low-tar and so-called light
cigarettes are worthless as a way to reduce health risks to smokers.
About 80% of the nation's smokers now consume light cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   The verdict marked the fifth time in recent years that juries in
California and Oregon have rendered large verdicts against the
tobacco companies--including one in Los Angeles for $3 billion that
was reduced to $100 million by a judge--in distinct contrast to
company victories in most other litigation.</TE>
<TE>   During a period of 35 years starting in 1960, cigarette makers won
virtually every trial by shifting attention from themselves to the
foolishness of smokers, who persisted in their habits despite health
warnings.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the cigarette companies have won more than three-fourths
of all the cases that have gone to verdict.</TE>
<TE>   But the industry's fortunes began to change in the mid-1990s after
reams of secret internal documents came to light showing that the
companies long knew of the health hazards and addictiveness of their
products.</TE>
<TE>   The industry lost an individual smoker case in 1996 in Florida,
and during the next two years the companies agreed to settlements
totaling close to $250 billion to fend off suits filed against them
by the states seeking to recoup tax money spent treating sick
smokers.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the industry has lost five cases brought by individual
smokers on the West Coast and was hit by a $145-billion damage
judgment in the summer of 2000 in a class-action case in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest Oregon case, Philip Morris attorneys asked for a
mistrial during jury deliberations after it was discovered that some
documents that the judge had excluded from evidence were in the jury
room. Judge Roosevelt Robinson denied Philip Morris' motion but gave
the jury a cautionary instruction and asked them to reconsider any
issues where they had relied on any of the documents that were not in
evidence. Ohlemeyer said that matter would be a part of the company's
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Ohlemeyer also said the company would ask the trial judge to
dramatically reduce the amount of the punitive damages on the grounds
that the ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages--about 900
to 1--"far exceed the 4-to-1 ratio the U.S. Supreme Court has
suggested may come close to the constitutional level of
reasonableness."</TE>
<TE>   Tobacco analysts Martin Feldman of Salomon Smith Barney and Bonnie
Herzog of Credit Suisse First Boston both said they thought the
punitive award would be slashed, as has happened in several recent
cigarette cases.</TE>
<TE>   Still, none of those recent verdicts has been overturned and an
appeal in this case could last years. Consequently, the outcome shook
some cigarette company insiders.</TE>
<TE>   For Philip Morris to lose a case in which the plaintiff was a
doctor who had quit smoking and was representing the estate of his
wife--a nurse who had smoked for years--is an ominous sign, said an
industry lawyer who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   If Philip Morris "can't win a case on these facts ... that's
pretty serious," he said. "If you've got a plaintiff who was a nurse,
... worked in her husband's medical office, and the guy himself was
the plaintiff, I don't know where you go from there," the attorney
said.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome "shows that Philip Morris has not found a strategy to
convince jurors on the West Coast to vote in its favor," Feldman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Sweda, senior attorney for the Tobacco Products Liability
Project at Northeastern University in Boston, was jubilant over the
outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "We are thrilled with the verdict," said Sweda, whose group
encourages litigation against the cigarette companies. "Clearly this
has to rattle the executives at Philip Morris because there are so
many potential plaintiffs out there in a similar situation--people
who switched to light cigarettes thinking they were helping
themselves but came down with a life-threatening or fatal disease."</TE>
<TE>   There were four plaintiffs in the case, all of whom are eligible
for a portion of the recovery under Oregon law: Dr. Richard Schwarz,
the husband of the deceased smoker; his sons Michael and Paul; and
Shirley Chuck, the mother of Michelle Schwarz.</TE>

<HD>Travelers Generates $3.88 Billion in Largest Insurance
Industry IPO</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Travelers Property Casualty Corp.'s shares notched solid gains in
Friday's trading debut, bucking the market's down trend, after the
Citigroup Inc. unit generated $3.88 billion in the biggest U.S.
initial public offering this year and the biggest insurance industry
IPO ever.</LD>
<LD>   Travelers, which trades under the ticker symbol TAP/A, climbed
$1.06 to close at $19.56 on the New York Stock Exchange. With trading
volume of 86.2 million shares, it was by far the Big Board's most
active issue.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of financial services giant Citigroup, which plans to keep
a 9.9% stake in Travelers and spin off the rest to its shareholders
by year's end, rose 24 cents to $49.84, also on the NYSE.</LD>
<TE>   Although demand for IPOs has slumped with the stock market since
2000, jumbo spinoff deals have been a bright spot. Nestle's eye-care
unit, Alcon, raised $2.3 billion in an initial stock offering
Wednesday. Alcon, which went public at $33 a share, closed at $34.75
on Friday, up 75 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the Travelers deal, which values the insurer at
about $18.5 billion, met with solid demand in part because investors
expect insurers' shares and earnings to get a boost from price
increases put in place after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Just as important, Travelers' position as an industry leader and
its focus on cost controls also attracted buyers, investors said.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers has "great management and a great track record at a time
when the insurance industry is benefiting from a surge in pricing,"
Tom Davis, an analyst at Loomis Sayles &amp; Co., told Bloomberg News.
The IPO price, near the upper end of the expected $16-to-$19 range,
was almost twice Travelers' book value of $9.90 a share, a valuation
in line with rivals such as Chubb Corp. and St. Paul Cos. The IPO
makes Travelers the second-biggest property casualty insurer by
market value, behind Allstate Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers raised an additional $850 million by issuing convertible
bonds due in 2023.</TE>
<TE>   The insurance industry has been a lucrative source of underwriting
business for Wall Street, which arranged only 90 U.S. IPOs last
year--the fewest in more than a decade and less than a quarter of the
number in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Prudential Financial Inc., the second-biggest U.S. insurer, raised
$3 billion in an IPO in December. Principal Financial Group Inc.
raised $1.9 billion in October.</TE>
<TE>   Other major deals could be in store: General Electric Co., for
example, is considering selling a 20% stake of its reinsurance unit,
Employers Reinsurance Corp.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi, Ovitz Firm Spar Over Venture</HD>
<DH>Media: Production deal with APG complicates French
company's plan to merge film units. Audit raises questions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Vivendi Universal's purchase of Barry Diller's USA Networks
entertainment assets nears closure, a plan to combine three existing
specialty film units has touched off a skirmish between Michael
Ovitz's Artists Production Group and the Paris-based conglomerate.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi Universal plans to shutter StudioCanal USA, a division of
French pay television giant Canal Plus. StudioCanal USA principally
funds movies to be made with Ovitz's APG.</LD>
<LD>   Universal has been negotiating for weeks to end the relationship
with APG, arguing over how much of the remaining financial
commitment--about $10 million--it still must pay, sources said.</LD>
<TE>   Complicating matters is an audit StudioCanal conducted of APG's
management of the joint venture. The audit took issue with APG's
allocation of staff time. The audit alleges, in part, that APG
staffers spent more time on outside film projects than authorized.</TE>
<TE>   The audit also uncovered some small discrepancies, such as several
thousand dollars that apparently was misspent on company sweatshirts
for a retreat and as much as $15,000 on holiday presents. The audit
did not find any funds missing.</TE>
<TE>   StudioCanal agreed in the original pact that APG staff members
would be allowed to work on outside projects as long as it did not
interfere with the progress of projects in the joint venture,
according to the original agreement between StudioCanal and APG. In
response to the audit, StudioCanal sent a memo to APG saying it was
confident that the division of staff labor had not interfered with
the joint venture projects.</TE>
<TE>   The memo also states that, no matter what the resolution of the
staffing dispute, the money to cover any discrepancies would come
from revenue from those outside projects.</TE>
<TE>   According to several sources close to the talks, Vivendi Universal
is using the audit as a way to force APG to settle for less money in
breaking the partnership. APG has disputed some of the audit findings
but is said to be on the verge of resolving the key obstacles to
ending the joint venture.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Universal executives declined to comment on the
negotiations. StudioCanal executives were unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   APG President Mark Canton, a former chairman of Columbia Pictures,
said, "The relationships that we have with Universal are very strong
and the projects in development are very attractive.... The business
relationship will be altered to make an opportunity to move forward
and make those movies."</TE>
<TE>   With StudioCanal, APG has developed 17 films. None has been put
into production.</TE>
<TE>   The deal with Ovitz was signed before StudioCanal was bought by
Vivendi and before Vivendi bought Universal Studios a year and a half
ago. StudioCanal USA agreed to cover overhead and costs incurred in
developing films with APG, about $8 million a year for three years.</TE>
<TE>   The fight has overshadowed the larger issue of Vivendi Universal's
plan to close StudioCanal USA, laying off perhaps 20 employees,
according to several sources. Vivendi also will be shutting down its
Universal Focus unit, laying off perhaps half a dozen employees.</TE>
<TE>   Diller's film unit, USA Films, is expected to emerge as the sole
specialty film unit for Vivendi Universal. The studio produced this
year's Oscar contender "Gosford Park" and last year's hit "Traffic."
The still unnamed unit will be headed by USA Films Chairman Scott
Greenstein and will command its own marketing and distribution,
according to sources.</TE>
<TE>   Greenstein will report directly to Universal Pictures Chairman
Stacey Snider.</TE>
<TE>   Universal Focus was a catchall label for small movies that were
deemed too insignificant for full-blown marketing campaigns. Although
there were surprise hits such as "Billy Elliot" and "Mulholland
Drive," those were the exceptions. Most of Universal Focus' films
were developed by outside production companies, so there was little
Universal commitment to their success, according to sources close to
the operation.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Universal shares dropped 47 cents on Friday to close at
$37.85 on the New York Stock Exchange. USA Networks shares fell 56
cents to close at $32.23 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A pair of federal judges on Friday named a mediator to urge a
settlement of legal claims against Enron Corp. and its former
accounting firm, Andersen.</LD>
<LD>   The judges overseeing Enron's bankruptcy and the federal
indictment against Andersen named Eric D. Green, a Boston-based law
professor, in a push to settle claims filed by Enron shareholders and
creditors.</LD>
<LD>   Green oversaw talks last year between federal prosecutors and
Microsoft Corp. that eventually led to a settlement of the Justice
Department's antitrust case against the software maker. Nine states
are still pursuing claims against the company.</LD>
<TE>   A court order released Friday directs the various parties in the
Enron litigation to begin the mediation process Sunday. The results
of the mediation are nonbinding.</TE>

<HD>AOL Employees to Use Rival E-Mail Programs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc., the biggest media and Internet company, will
allow employees to use rival e-mail providers after some workers said
they couldn't send large documents through the company's America
Online system.</LD>
<LD>   The decision was made this week at a meeting of the divisions'
chief executives. After America Online Inc. bought Time Warner Inc.
last year for $124 billion, the new company installed America
Online's software at units such as magazine publisher Time Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Because most of America Online's more than 34 million subscribers
are consumers, the e-mail system is geared for personal, rather than
business, use. The company's efforts to sell a corporate version of
its Internet service called AOL Enterprise never took off, leaving
rival Microsoft Corp. as one of the dominant providers of corporate
e-mail.</LD>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner employees probably will be switched to Microsoft's
Outlook program because that's what many corporations use, an analyst
said.</TE>

$600,000, or 14 cents a share, from $1.4 million, or 30 cents a

<HD>Credit Firms Warn Verizon, Cut Lucent</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Times News Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two big credit rating firms said Verizon Communications Inc.
should reduce its dependence on volatile short-term borrowings or
increase bank commitments backing the debt. Verizon, which has $12.8
billion in debt that matures in less than nine months, may see its
financing costs rise if it shifts to more expensive longer-term
notes.</LD>
<LD>   The company backed its short- term debt with $8.5 billion in cash
and bank credit commitments, which may not be enough, said Moody's
Investors Service analyst Dennis Saputo. Standard &amp; Poor's also said
Verizon would need to reduce debt to maintain its current A-plus
rating.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, Lucent Technologies Inc. took a further tumble into
speculative-grade territory after Moody's cut its credit rating two
notches to B2 from Ba3. Moody's attributed the downgrade to a
prolonged business downturn for the telecom equipment maker.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of New York-based Verizon fell $1.42, or 3%, to $45.61 on
the New York Stock Exchange, their lowest level in a month.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent shares fell 20 cents, or 4.2%, to $4.59 on the NYSE. The
company's 7.25% notes due in 2006 fell two points to 82.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Conseco Inc. renegotiated terms for repaying $1.5 billion of bank
debt, another step in efforts by the troubled insurance and loan firm
to satisfy rating agencies it can pay back debts due this year.</LD>
<LD>   Conseco's stock rose 16 cents, or 4%, to $3.76 on the NYSE.</LD>
<LD>   Banks agreed to lower Carmel, Ind.-based Conseco's liquidity
requirement to $50 million from $100million, and dropped an agreement
that forced it to allocate 50% of proceeds from asset sales to paying
off bank debt.</LD>
<TE>   In return, the banks raised interest rates on the bank debt for
Conseco by three-quarters of a percentage point to 3.25% above LIBOR,
the standard rate at which banks lend to each other.</TE>
<TE>   Conseco is scrambling to sell assets to meet bond and bank debt
repayments due this year.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Conseco has about $6billion of debt, run up after its
disastrous purchase of loan firm Green Tree Financial four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned about the firm's financial fragility, rating agency
Moody's Investors Service has warned it will downgrade the firm's
debt rating unless it can show by the end of March it can meet its
debts due this year.</TE>

<LD>Shares of Hewlett-Packard Co. dropped nearly 2% after an internal
memo surfaced saying revenue and profit in the company's services
division were "well below plan."</LD>
<LD>   The memo from Ann Livermore, who heads the services division, was
sent Monday, a day before stockholders voted on HP's contested
acquisition of Compaq Computer Corp., a deal now valued at $19.5
billion. HP claims to have a "slim but sufficient" edge in the
voting, which could take weeks to certify.</LD>
<LD>   Livermore wrote that orders for HP's technology services were very
soft, calling it a "cause for concern," according to the memo, which
was obtained by Dow Jones Newswires. She said HP's proxy fight over
the Compaq deal had been a potential distraction for employees and
customers.</LD>
<TE>   A bad quarter in services could have a big effect on the entire
company. Services brought in 17% of HP's $45 billion in revenue last
year and grew 6%, while sales declined in the company's computing
systems division and in its "crown jewel," the imaging and printing
business.</TE>
<TE>   HP spokeswoman Rebeca Robboy said Livermore's memo was a routine
quarterly update to rally her troops and that HP felt no need to
update its financial guidance to Wall Street. HP shares fell 35 cents
to close at $18.15 on the NYSE.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chicago-based Boeing Co. said it expects to win a $9.7-billion
contract for 60 more C-17 transport planes within 30 days, and the
planes would be delivered between 2004 and 2008.</LD>
<LD>   "We should be awarded the contract within 30 days," said Howard
Chambers, vice president and general manager of Boeing Aircraft &amp;
Missile Systems in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   The Defense Department already has agreed to buy 120 C-17s, and
the follow-on contract for 60 more C-17s, which Boeing said it
discounted 25%, has been expected for some time.</LD>
<TE>   Boeing is eyeing a possible additional order after Air Force Gen.
John Handy, commander of the U.S. Transportation Command, last month
said the military needed 42 more planes to meet its combat and
humanitarian mission needs.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing officials have said the contract for 60 more planes will
keep Boeing's production line in Long Beach operating through 2008.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing shares fell $1.28 to $46.39 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Goodyear Pension Plan Has $1-Billion Deficit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. said its pension plan has a deficit of
about $1 billion because of $230 million in losses and a jump in the
number of retirees last year.</LD>
<LD>   Goodyear expected to earn $440 million on its pension investments
last year, a spokesman said. That would have helped fund a planned
increase in benefits beginning in 2001, which caused workers to wait
until then to retire.</LD>
<LD>   The deficit could have "significant" consequences on cash flow and
earnings and may increase to as much as $1.2 billion this year, said
Stephen Girsky, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co.</LD>
<TE>   Goodyear issued about 4.3 million shares in the third quarter as a
contribution to the plan, according to the company's annual
regulatory filing.</TE>
<TE>   Akron, Ohio-based Goodyear shares fell 30 cents to $24.66 on the

<HD>United Airlines to Recall Workers</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Firm has cut 20,000 jobs since Sept. 11 but
will bring back as many as 2,200 to meet summer demand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, which laid off about 20,000 workers
after the Sept. 11 attacks, will recall as many as 2,200 employees in
five major cities because of an increased June flight schedule.</LD>
<LD>   The world's second-biggest carrier will recruit as many as 900 new
workers if laid-off employees choose not to relocate for the jobs,
said spokesman Chris Brathwaite.The baggage handler, customer service
and cleaning jobs are in Chicago, Washington, Los Angeles, San
Francisco and Denver.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, UAL said it was shutting down its Avolar business jet
unit, saying the venture wasn't financially viable amid the U.S.
economic slowdown and fallout from the terrorist attacks. Closing the
venture will let UAL focus on United's service, the company said. UAL
had provided $80 million to Avolar.</LD>
<TE>   United and some rivals have begun adding back flights in advance
of the summer travel season and to meet the gradual increase in
passenger traffic since the attacks doused demand.</TE>
<TE>   The carrier said its seat and flight capacity would be about 17%
below the year-earlier level even after the June schedule increase.
United is restoring 77 flights in Chicago by June 7 but didn't say
how many flights it would add in the other U.S. cities or to the
whole network. Earlier this month, United rehired about 660 flight
attendants.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago-based carrier has focused on restoring service in
major cities to increase the frequency of flights mainly to better
serve business travelers.</TE>
<TE>   Passenger traffic, or miles flown by paying passengers, has been
rising a few percentage points each month since the Sept. 11 attacks
mainly because of increased leisure travel. Most major U.S. carriers,
including United, have said average fares remain low because of less
business from high-fare corporate travelers.</TE>
<TE>   On another front, two leading online travel agencies began
countering United's decision to eliminate per-ticket sales
commissions this week.</TE>
<TE>   Travelocity.com Inc. added a $10 fee to all United fares late
Thursday, and Expedia Inc. altered the carrier's displays on its Web
site, leaving off prices and putting its routes at the bottom of the
page.</TE>
<TE>   Other major airlines also phased out the commissions but were not
similarly affected because they agreed to compensate Travelocity and
Expedia in other ways. For example, a carrier might pay a bonus if
the online agency can meet a certain sales target or boost the
airline's overall market share on that site.</TE>
<TE>   UAL's shares rose 56 cents to $15.70 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Youth Can Be an Asset for Academic Decathlon Coach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Altair Maine went to college when he was 11 and entered a Caltech
doctoral program at 16. And yes, his parents are rocket scientists.
Now 22, he is thought to be the youngest person to coach an academic
decathlon team in the state.</LD>
<LD>   Although he often dresses in a shirt and tie, the baby-faced coach
of North Hollywood High School's so-called "acadeca" team is often
mistaken for a student. But after leading the team to a second-place
finish in the Los Angeles Unified School District competition, and
ruffling some feathers along the way, opponents were taking him
seriously as the first day of the California Academic Decathlon began
Friday in Modesto.</LD>
<LD>   "They're one of the teams to beat," said Michael Jones, acadeca
coach at Marshall High School in Los Angeles. "El Camino has got to
really look out for North Hollywood."</LD>
<TE>   El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills is the defending
national champion and a team that Maine said he respects and wants to
emulate.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, competitors say Maine's team is an arrogant one that
they would like to see lose. In the district competition last month,
the North Hollywood students dressed in military fatigues. The
theatrics rubbed some people the wrong way.</TE>
<TE>   Also causing some bad feelings was a controversial Web site
maintained by a North Hollywood student that criticized the El Camino
team.</TE>
<TE>   Maine, who asked the student to shut it down, said, "I should have
caught that Web page earlier."</TE>
<TE>   "These kids are really driven and really want to win," he said.
"Everybody wants to beat El Camino, but there's no malice there."</TE>
<TE>   The Web site flap "has been overblown," said Cliff Ker, decathlon
coordinator for the Los Angeles Unified School District. "They're
great kids. They're always trying to find a competitive edge."</TE>
<TE>   Southland Schools Well-Represented</TE>
<TE>   They'll need one in the field of 51 teams in Modesto. North
Hollywood is one of nine teams from LAUSD. There also are four other
teams from Los Angeles County--two public and two private--as well as
competitors from Ventura, Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside and San
Diego counties.</TE>
<TE>   The decathlon ends with the Super Quiz on Saturday. The
competitors are divided into three divisions, depending on the size
of their school. Division winners, which will be announced Sunday,
will represent California next month in the national competition in
Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Maine didn't see all this coming when he joined the North
Hollywood faculty at age 21, about the same time its acadeca coach
quit. Shortly afterward, the district's top-scorer, Phillip Tanedo,
then an 11th-grader, recruited Maine to be the coach.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Maine had much in common with the decathletes. He
understood what it was like to be a gifted student in the
less-than-prestigious surroundings of a large public school. Unlike
most other teachers in the Highly Gifted Magnet program on campus, in
which some of the decathletes are enrolled, Maine felt like a peer,
treating students like young adults. They call him by his first name.</TE>
<TE>   "He's one of us," Tanedo said, "someone we can relate to."</TE>
<TE>   On Maine's birthday two weeks ago, the team took him to a video
arcade to play a game in which players must quickly follow dance
moves displayed on a screen. Maine proved that his gift for math and
science did not translate to rhythm, his students said.</TE>
<TE>   The team is tight-knit. They spent two weeks of their winter break
at a rented house in Twenty-nine Palms preparing for the competition.
One student stayed up 72 hours studying, a feat considered
masochistic even by acadeca standards.</TE>
<TE>   But, as with most teams, there's a sense that hard work pays off.
The team made its first appearance in state competition during
Maine's inaugural year and finished eighth overall. This year, North
Hollywood's district score was fourth-best.</TE>
<TE>   Maine never went to high school himself. He skipped first and
fourth grades and said goodbye to junior high in the seventh grade.
Paradoxically, he said he never would have participated in the
academic decathlon had he attended high school. He never liked
cramming or studying through memorization.</TE>
<TE>   "Learning is a matter of paying attention and thinking when first
presented," Maine said.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired to Go Into Teaching</TE>
<TE>   He credits his parents, both engineers for NASA at Edwards Air
Force Base, for most of his early knowledge. He said he has no
regrets about being ushered through a special college program for
gifted children at Cal State Los Angeles, where he earned a degree in
geology.</TE>
<TE>   He spent 21/2 years in the doctoral program at Caltech, but said
he didn't have the temperament to continue. But it did inspire him to
become a teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Maine said he turned down lucrative offers to be a computer
programmer and decided to teach because he wanted to bring higher
standards to the public school system.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very committed and has an enormous sense of character," said
North Hollywood Principal John Hyland. "He's not just intelligent, he
has a sense of purpose. He had many choices, but he chose to be a
public school teacher."</TE>

<HD>Site for Proposed Stadium in Limbo</HD>
<DH>Development: A football facility in downtown L.A. could
boost the economy. But amassing 55 acres would be tough.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ and MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since Philip Anschutz let out that he may be planning to build a
football stadium in downtown Los Angeles, the Colorado billionaire
has created a buzz about where he might put such a massive project.</LD>
<LD>   But many within the commercial real estate industry and in
economic development agencies are skeptical that such a plan is
financially or politically feasible, even if City Hall agrees to
help.</LD>
<LD>   Even if Anschutz and his partners, whose billions and past
successes make it impossible to dismiss the idea, are serious about
the stadium, the effort is very preliminary and the outcome is far
from certain.</LD>
<TE>   The initial outline of Anschutz's plan would require a 55-acre
complex, the equivalent of 10 city blocks. That would be among the
largest and most disruptive single developments in downtown Los
Angeles in many decades.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial brokers could not think of a site that would remotely
accommodate such a major development without major relocations of
businesses and residents and the expenditure of several hundred
million dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "This one won't be easy," said real estate investment broker Carl
Muhlstein of Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, business and city leaders are not dismissing the
Anschutz initiative, given his roles in rejuvenating downtown Denver,
and helping to develop Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles..</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz has undertaken past projects with large degrees of
stealth, so his actions so far regarding the proposed football
stadium are part of his apparent operating style. He declined to
discuss his activities with The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz has been a growing force in the sports and entertainment
industries, filing earlier this week to sell stock in his theater
chain. The $345-million public offering would further consolidate his
control of that industry.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz, worth an estimated $9.6 billion, built his fortune
bartering railroad rights of way and creating a 16,000-mile fiber
optic network that is now Qwest Communications. Recently, he has been
building a sports empire with stakes in the Los Angeles Kings hockey
team and the Colorado Rapids and Chicago Fire soccer teams. He
currently is building a $120-million sports complex at Cal State
Dominguez in Carson, eventually to house the Los Angeles Galaxy
soccer team, which he owns.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles proposal comes after a recent slew of football
stadiums have been constructed and approved for downtowns, ranging
from Seattle to Baltimore. The locations are often well served by
freeways and mass transit systems, and supporters say the stadiums
have helped draw substantial numbers of visitors and new developments
to struggling downtowns.</TE>
<TE>   Staples Center--built in part by Anschutz and developer Ed
Roski--is credited with triggering new retail and residential
development on nearby blocks.</TE>
<TE>   "Downtown is the only logical place for [the football stadium],"
said Carol Schatz, president of the Central City Assn., downtown's
leading business advocacy group. The facility "would create a lot of
positive synergy with what's already here and with what's happening."</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to build a football stadium in Southern California have
included such sites as a gravel pit in Irwindale and industrial land
in Carson. The Rose Bowl in Pasadena and the Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum have also been mentioned as possible homes for a National
Football League team.</TE>
<TE>   Despite enthusiasm for the new idea, Schatz and many others in
downtown business and real estate circles had not heard about the
plans until they surfaced in the media, leading many to say the
effort must be in the very early conceptual stage.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see anything at the moment," said Michael Pfeiffer,
executive director of the South Park Stakeholders Group, a coalition
of property owners, businesses and institutions in the southern
section of downtown. "It's an intriguing idea. It's an exciting idea.
We will just have to see how it unfolds."</TE>
<TE>   The stadium backers--who include Anschutz, Roski and financier Ron
Burkle, another billionaire and one with long political involvement
in Los Angeles and nationally--have declined to say if they have
identified a specific location downtown. Despite hundreds of acres
devoted to parking lots and underused commercial properties, amassing
the 55 acres the Anschutz group said it needs could cost at least
$300 million, say real estate brokers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see where you are taking a bulldozer and scraping away 10
city blocks," said one real estate broker who specializes in downtown
land sales.</TE>
<TE>   Some have speculated that a few large industrial and vacant
parcels in the northeast and southeast portions of downtown could be
combined to create a site large enough to accommodate a football
stadium and be easily accessible by freeway and rail transportation.
In addition, about 40 acres of vacant and underused land west of the
Harbor Freeway near the Belmont Learning Complex and Downtown Center
Studios could be a viable location.</TE>
<TE>   However, most real estate observers agree that the ideal area also
would prove to be the most expensive and problematic: South Park,
which includes Staples Center. In addition to being a short walk from
Staples--home to the Lakers and Clippers basketball teams and the
Kings hockey franchise--a South Park stadium would be near a proposed
entertainment and hotel district and commuter rail lines. An
investment group failed to win support for a South Park stadium a few
years ago during the last major effort to attract a professional
football team to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Despite many attractive features, or because of them, South Park
is also an increasingly popular site for housing and other retail
projects that have sent land prices soaring. Recent land sales in the
area have approached $125 a square foot--far above what many say
would make economic sense for a football stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The city could use eminent domain to assemble land at cost, such
as was done for Staples Center, and be helpful in other ways, such as
streamlining the planning process and paying for traffic
improvements.</TE>
<TE>   But Mayor James K. Hahn has made it clear that the city will not
subsidize a stadium project.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate broker Steve Soboroff, who helped close the deal on
Staples Center, said that project proved that a major sports arena
could be built without public subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   "At Staples, there were many different parcels owned by many
different people that we wanted to acquire," said Soboroff, who is
now president of Playa Vista. "The city used its powers to basically
take control of that land and purchase that land."</TE>
<TE>   One of the city's leading businessmen said Friday that building a
football stadium from scratch without the help of public subsidies or
the guarantee of a team is a risky proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way you can invest $400 million to $500 million in the
cost of a stadium, and have any revenues that make sense," he said.
"With Staples, you've got 280 events a year. With a football stadium,
how many events can you have? Ten? Twenty?"</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz, Roski and other partners are seeking city financial
support to build a 27-acre hotel, entertainment and retail district
on the blocks immediately north and east of Staples, at Figueroa and
11th streets.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel and entertainment property could conceivably be combined
with other nearby lots to include a football stadium, but that would
unravel years of agreements and deals with the city and is viewed as
highly unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   "Assembling the site will be difficult if you want to be anywhere
close to Staples," said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los
Angeles County Economic Development Corp. "This is going to be a
challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Many in the 70-block South Park area say they are not aware of any
effort to buy land for a stadium, but some say they would welcome
such a project.</TE>
<TE>   A few blocks east of Staples Center, Jeff Ingham, who handles
leasing at the towering Transamerica Center, said a neighboring
football stadium would make the area more attractive to visitors and
workers alike.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be very positive, because it would bring in a lot of
amenities and more restaurants within walking distance," he said. "It
would only benefit us."</TE>

<HD>Boot Camp Yet Another El Toro Idea</HD>
<DH>Military: Congressman's proposal to move the West Coast
facility from San Diego is at least the third base reuse bid since
voters rejected airport.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Suddenly, it seems, everyone wants a piece of El Toro. Even the
Marines.</LD>
<LD>   The latest proposal, by Rep. Randy "Duke" Cunningham
(R-Escondido), calls for moving the Marines' West Coast boot camp
from San Diego to a portion of the former El Toro Marine base. That,
in turn, would allow San Diego's airport, Lindbergh Field, to expand
onto the depot property.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for Marine headquarters in Virginia declined to
comment Friday on the proposal to move what is officially called the
Marine Corps Recruit Depot, an idea that Cunningham's office said was
developed in recent weeks during meetings with Marine Corps
Commandant Gen. James Jones.</LD>
<TE>   "As a matter of policy, we prefer not to comment on private
conversations the commandant has with government officials," Maj.
Matthew McLaughlin said. "We are aware of the initiative led by
Congressman Cunningham and will continue to look at all options
available."</TE>
<TE>   On March 5, Orange County voters rezoned the 4,700-acre El Toro
base for a park, nature preserve and low-density
development--grounding eight years of planning by Orange County for a
commercial airport that eventually was to become the second largest
in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham's bid for a slice of El Toro is at least the third to
emerge since the election, when Navy officials declared that, without
an airport at the base, they intend to sell the bulk of the property
to developers. A final decision is expected April 23.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista) suggested trading a chunk of base land
to a residential developer in exchange for building badly needed
housing at Camp Pendleton in north San Diego County. As many as 2,000
military families are on a waiting list for housing there.</TE>
<TE>   Two Orange County supervisors asked Navy officials last week to
consider giving 300 acres of El Toro to Cal State Fullerton for a
South County campus. Several investors also toured the area,
including a group that for at least three years has eyed land on the
base for a pro football stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The vacuum created by the loss of a future airport, and the lack
of a plan to replace it, triggered the last-minute scrambling, said
Jeffrey Finkle, executive director of the National Assn. of
Installation Developers in Washington, which works on reusing
military bases.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that there appears to be a crack in the facade of the
process, everybody wants a piece of the pie," Finkle said. "If [local
officials] don't reemerge as a strong advocate for the future
condition of this property, they'll get willy-nilly [development]."</TE>
<TE>   "We call it the great El Toro land grab," said Gary Simon,
executive director of Orange County's El Toro planning office.
Planners are working on base options that they'll deliver April 16 to
the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said his office has been deluged with calls from people
pitching development proposals, and had to cut off base tours because
of the demand. "Every Tom, Dick and Harry wants a piece of the base,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Moving the Marine Corps back to El Toro would mean reactivating a
portion of the base, which closed in July 1999 along with its sister
base in Tustin. Navy Lt. Comdr. Pauline Storum said Friday from
Washington that she knew of no other base in the country that was
closed and then reopened.</TE>
<TE>   During an Orange County appearance last month, Vice President Dick
Cheney was asked about bringing the Marines back to El Toro and
dismissed the notion. "We need to be careful that we don't spend
money on bases that might not be needed," he said during a luncheon
at the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace in Yorba Linda.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Chris Cox (R-Newport Beach), whose district includes El Toro,
said Friday that he was aware of discussions about moving the
Marines' West Coast boot camp to El Toro but called the prospects
"highly unlikely."</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the Navy's intention to sell base acreage, Cox said,
"The Pentagon now has a plan for El Toro and it's my understanding
that this is not part of it."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Rep. Susan Davis (D-San Diego), whose district
includes Lindbergh Field and the boot camp, said she hadn't been
contacted by the Marines.</TE>
<TE>   Moving the boot camp was embraced by Cunningham as a way to give
the Marines more training space and allow expansion of San Diego's
cramped airport. At 550 acres, Lindbergh is about the size of Orange
County's John Wayne Airport but handles twice as many
passengers--15.2 million last year compared with about 7.5 million at
John Wayne.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham's proposal would give the Marines up to 1,000 acres at
El Toro, triple the size of the 388-acre San Diego boot camp, which
the Marines have operated since 1923. It handles about 21,000
recruits during each 13-week training session. The Marines' only
other U.S. boot camp is at Parris Island, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham said San Diego and its port authority could help
finance the estimated $500-million construction cost for a new
training facility at El Toro by paying for the boot camp property.</TE>
<TE>   Finkle, of the base development association, said his fear is that
the Bush administration will decide, based on El Toro's example, to
sell closed bases rather than let local agencies hash out what should
be built on them. The Defense Authorization Act of 2002 changed
regulations to require that if land isn't provided for public
purposes, it must be sold for cash to bolster the defense budget.</TE>
<TE>   "Land is not as valuable in other places in the country [and] a
lot of communities might not roll over and let the Department of
Defense do whatever they want," Finkle said.</TE>

<HD>A High Price on Its Head, Schools Hold the Lettuce</HD>
<DH>Produce: Cafeterias try substituting for suddenly expensive
staple, but many students don't buy it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI and MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Luis Ortiz's sandwich had ham, cheese and pickles. But something was
missing from the lunch he bought for a dollar in Hollywood High
School's cafeteria: lettuce.</LD>
<LD>   The 17-year-old junior frowned when he examined the sandwich
through the plastic wrapping and noticed the green stuff was absent.</LD>
<LD>   It was also missing from other sandwiches, salad bars and side
dishes at many schools throughout California this week. With the
worst lettuce shortage in 15 years and sharply rising prices, schools
across the state have at least temporarily stopped or cut back on
serving the leafy vegetable in all its crunchy and limp varieties.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Unified School District, which reduced its normal
weekly lettuce purchase of 50,000 pounds to 2,500, substituted with
coleslaw, fruit, carrots or cooked veggies such as green beans.
Saddleback Valley Unified School District in Orange County turned to
alternatives such as spinach.</TE>
<TE>   Other districts such as Santa Monica Unified, Pasadena Unified and
Buena Park School District have done likewise or tossed a cheaper
salad blend of lettuce mixed with cabbage. Some call it a "crisis
blend," said Buena Park food services clerk Maria Gross, who added:
"I had some today and it was very good."</TE>
<TE>   Others have gone cold turkey: total withdrawal.</TE>
<TE>   Luis, however, did not care about the reasons or the replacements.
He didn't want to hear about predictions that lettuce may return in
cafeteria fare in a few weeks. He wanted his lettuce now or a price
cut.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always paid a dollar and it comes with lettuce and tomato.
And in the past few days they've started changing things.... I think
they're taking advantage of us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Produce experts say prices may return to a reasonable level within
a month and lettuce will once again add a hint of green to the
normally dull-colored tuna sandwich or hamburger. Until then, schools
and consumers will have to cope with prices that are 4 to 5 times
higher than normal.</TE>
<TE>   Rudy Rios, owner of Highland Produce in Orange County, which
supplies lettuce to several Southern California school districts,
said there is simply not enough available. He is selling a lot more
shredded cabbage and carrot substitute, "but kids don't like that,"
he said. "They like the salads."</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Zamora, 15, had been craving a lunch salad with lettuce,
cherry tomatoes, peppers and mushrooms for three days. But every time
the ninth-grader geared herself up for a healthy lunch in Gardena
Senior High School's cafeteria this week, she was disappointed. She
passed by the hot vegetables such string beans and the raw carrots
and celery.</TE>
<TE>   Some classmates turned to snack machines to fill their stomachs.
But not Zamora, who skipped lunch altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "They should have more money for food," Zamora said. "The salad's
the only thing that's nutritious."</TE>
<TE>   Mayra Colindres, 40, a cafeteria worker at Hollywood High, said
she feels bad because some students have complained.</TE>
<TE>   "We who have children who eat in the cafeteria are really
worried," she said. "But I am not sure about those on the top. It
seems like they don't care. They say they are worried about the
nutrition of our kids, but they keep on reducing the food."</TE>
<TE>   Crystal Espinoza, 16, a student at John Marshall High School in
Los Angeles, said that sandwiches and hamburgers just don't taste the
same without lettuce. "It's dry," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Unified, which serves about 323,000 lunches, normally
pays 42 cents a pound for lettuce but now is being charged $1.90 a
pound, said Pearl Iizuka, deputy business manager.</TE>
<TE>   The lettuce they can afford is reserved for salad bars in some
middle or high schools. Other districts such as Bassett Unified and
Hacienda La Puente in the San Gabriel Valley stopped serving lettuce
altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not only because of the price, but the quality," said
Carolyn Wells, director of food services for Bassett. "It is soggy,
not a lot of weight to it.... I don't want to offer my students
anything that isn't going to look right."</TE>
<TE>   A cold spell in Arizona this year stunted most lettuce crops
there, delaying the winter harvest, said Jesus Valencia, a farm
advisor for the University of California. California produces 50% of
the nation's lettuce, but its harvests won't be ready for at least
another month, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Maggie Masch, associate director of the Center for Food and
Justice at Occidental College, said students are more likely to eat
healthy foods with a touch of lettuce to make them look more
appealing. If there is no lettuce, they may turn to less healthy
alternatives such as pizza, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Carmen Rita Nevarez, a medical director for the Public Health
Institute, an independent nonprofit group based in Berkeley, said
lettuce is not the most nutritious vegetable anyway, although it is a
good source of fiber. She said the shortage could be a great
opportunity for schools and youngsters to get creative.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't have to be a slave to lettuce," Nevarez said.
"Substitute a banana. Substitute a mango. I happen to love Brussels
sprouts."</TE>

<DH>Schools: Lunchrooms offer substitutes for suddenly
expensive staple, but many students don't buy it.</DH>

<LD>Luis Ortiz's sandwich had ham, cheese and pickles. But something was
missing from the lunch he bought for a dollar in Hollywood High
School's cafeteria: lettuce.</LD>
<LD>   The 17-year-old junior frowned when he examined the sandwich
through the plastic wrapping and noticed the green stuff was absent.</LD>
<LD>   It was also missing from other sandwiches, salad bars and side
dishes at many schools throughout California this week. With the
worst lettuce shortage in 15 years and sharply rising prices, schools
across the state have at least temporarily stopped or cut back on
serving the leafy vegetable in all its crunchy and limp varieties.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Unified School District, which reduced its normal
weekly lettuce purchase of 50,000 pounds to 2,500, substituted with
coleslaw, fruit, carrots or cooked veggies such as green beans.</TE>
<TE>   Saddleback Valley Unified School District in Orange County turned
to alternatives such as spinach.</TE>
<TE>   Other districts such as Santa Monica Unified, Pasadena Unified and
the Buena Park School District have done likewise or tossed a cheaper
salad blend of lettuce mixed with cabbage. Some call it a "crisis
blend," said Buena Park food services clerk Maria Gross, who added:
"I had some today and it was very good."</TE>
<TE>   Others have gone cold turkey.</TE>
<TE>   Luis, however, did not care about the reasons or the replacements.
He didn't want to hear about predictions that lettuce may return in
cafeteria fare in a few weeks. He wanted his lettuce now or a price
cut.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always paid a dollar and it comes with lettuce and tomato.
And in the past few days they've started changing things.... I think
they're taking advantage of us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Produce experts say prices may return to a reasonable level within
a month and lettuce will once again add a hint of green to the
normally dull-colored tuna sandwich or hamburger. Until then, schools
and consumers will have to cope with prices that are four to five
times higher than normal.</TE>
<TE>   Rudy Rios, owner of Highland Produce in Orange County, which
supplies lettuce to several Southern California school districts,
said there is simply not enough available. He is selling a lot more
shredded cabbage and carrot substitute, "but kids don't like that,"
he said. "They like the salads."</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Zamora, 15, had been craving a lunch salad with lettuce,
cherry tomatoes, peppers and mushrooms for three days. But every time
the ninth-grader geared herself up for a healthy lunch in Gardena
Senior High School's cafeteria this week, she was disappointed. She
passed by the hot vegetables and the raw carrots and celery.</TE>
<TE>   Some classmates turned to snack machines, but not Zamora, who
skipped lunch altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "They should have more money for food," Zamora said. "The salad's
the only thing that's nutritious."</TE>
<TE>   Mayra Colindres, 40, a cafeteria worker at Hollywood High, said
she feels bad because some students have complained.</TE>
<TE>   "We who have children who eat in the cafeteria are really
worried," she said. "But I am not sure about those on the top. It
seems like they don't care. They say they are worried about the
nutrition of our kids, but they keep on reducing the food."</TE>
<TE>   Crystal Espinoza, 16, a student at John Marshall High School in
Los Angeles, said that sandwiches and hamburgers just don't taste the
same without lettuce. "It's dry," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Unified, which serves about 323,000 lunches, usually
pays 42 cents a pound for lettuce but now is being charged $1.90 a
pound, said Pearl Iizuka, deputy business manager.</TE>
<TE>   The lettuce they can afford is reserved for salad bars in some
middle or high schools. Other districts such as Bassett Unified and
Hacienda La Puente in the San Gabriel Valley stopped serving it
entirely.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not only because of the price, but the quality," said
Carolyn Wells, director of food services for Bassett. "It is soggy,
not a lot of weight to it.... I don't want to offer my students
anything that isn't going to look right."</TE>
<TE>   A cold spell in Arizona this year stunted most lettuce crops
there, delaying the winter harvest, said Jesus Valencia, a farm
advisor for the University of California. California produces 50% of
the nation's lettuce, but its harvests won't be ready for at least a
month, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Maggie Masch, associate director of the Center for Food and
Justice at Occidental College, said students are more likely to eat
healthy foods with a touch of lettuce to make them more appealing. If
there is no lettuce, they may turn to less healthy alternatives such
as pizza, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Carmen Rita Nevarez, a medical director for the Public Health
Institute, an independent nonprofit group based in Berkeley, said
lettuce is not the most nutritious vegetable, although it is a good
source of fiber. She said the shortage could be a great opportunity
for schools and youngsters to get creative.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't have to be a slave to lettuce," said Nevarez.
"Substitute a banana. Substitute a mango. I happen to love Brussels
sprouts."</TE>

<HD>Basis for Appeal Seen in Maul Verdict</HD>
<DH>Law: Some legal experts say dog owner's murder conviction
was based on weak evidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN and LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One day after a San Francisco lawyer was found guilty of murder in
the fatal dog mauling of her neighbor, law experts said Friday that
there may be several strong grounds for an appeal.</LD>
<LD>   The case included weak evidence for the second-degree murder
charge, inflammatory testimony about the defendants' connection to
the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang, an ineffective defense attorney
and a judge who threatened to throw that attorney in jail for making
an improper objection, several lawyers and law professors said.</LD>
<LD>   The murder conviction was the first in a dog attack case in
California. It could result in a state prison sentence of 15 years to
life for Marjorie Knoller, whose dogs attacked 33-year-old Diane
Whipple in a hallway of their Pacific Heights apartment building Jan.
26, 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike two other dog-related murder convictions in other states,
there was no evidence presented at trial that Knoller trained her
Presa Canarios to attack or that she set them on the victim.</TE>
<TE>   In Ohio, a defendant was convicted of murder in 1993 after he
knocked his wife unconscious and set his pit bull on her.</TE>
<TE>   In Kansas, a woman was convicted of murder in 1998 after
prosecutors proved that she trained her Rottweilers to be aggressive
and failed to keep them restrained. Her dogs mauled a young neighbor
to death.</TE>
<TE>   "This is night and day," said professor Franklin Zimring, who
teaches criminal law at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law.</TE>
<TE>   In the Ohio and Kansas cases, Zimring said, the defendants wanted
the dogs to kill. But in this case, he said, "Nobody has argued that
this defendant [Knoller] wanted to kill anybody with those dogs."</TE>
<TE>   Knoller's guilty verdict sets a precedent that dog owners can be
convicted of murder even if they did not intentionally use their dogs
as weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller and her husband, Robert Noel, who was not present during
the attack, were convicted of involuntary manslaughter and keeping a
mischievous dog that kills. Noel faces four years in state prison.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors maintained through the five-week trial in Los Angeles
Superior Court that Knoller and Noel had seen their dogs act
aggressively more than 30 times before the fatal attack.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys said their clients did not know their dogs were
dangerous and couldn't have anticipated the mauling.</TE>
<TE>   The trial included a gang expert who testified that Knoller and
Noel were associates of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang and that
they helped inmates at Pelican Bay State Prison run an attack dog
breeding ring.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller's defense attorney, Nedra Ruiz, presented her case in a
dramatic fashion, even getting down on the floor to reenact the fatal
mauling.</TE>
<TE>   She also made two objections during prosecutors' closing
arguments, prompting the judge to order her to take a seat and
threaten to throw her into a holding cell if she stood up again.</TE>
<TE>   But jurors said they convicted Knoller of murder because she
should have known her dogs could maul someone to death.</TE>
<TE>   "She knew what these dogs were capable of," jury foreman Don
Newton said Friday. "This is a very arrogant woman who over and over
was warned and brushed off the warnings."</TE>
<TE>   Newton said jurors concluded that Knoller and Noel should have
taken the Presa Canarios to obedience training because that breed of
dog is naturally aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller also should have put a muzzle or choke collar on the dogs
that afternoon, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Marjorie knew she couldn't control the dog, and she either took
the dog out or let the dog loose," Newton said.</TE>
<TE>   A few jurors considered the possibility that Knoller had, in fact,
allowed the dogs to attack Whipple.</TE>
<TE>   Because they didn't believe Knoller's testimony during trial, the
jurors went around in a circle and gave their version of what they
thought occurred in the hallway, Newton said.</TE>
<TE>   The issue was not about dogs to the jurors, 10 of whom had owned
dogs in their lives, Newton said, but that Knoller had a "blatant
disregard for human life."</TE>
<TE>   Knoller testified that she had tried desperately to save Whipple's
life by trying to shield her from the dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "This case establishes that if you own a big, powerful dog, you
could go to jail for the rest of your life because you should have
known the dog could have inflicted injury on someone," said Los
Angeles attorney Kenneth Phillips, who represents dog-bite victims.</TE>
<TE>   "Dog owners better get the message that they have to keep their
neighbors safe from their own dogs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Zimring said the murder conviction took him by surprise.
"Second-degree murder, I think, is a very problematic stretch," he
added.</TE>
<TE>   He said that because there was no evidence of implied malice--that
is, that Knoller had a conscious disregard for life--the
prosecution's case hinged on the seriousness of Whipple's mauling and
the defendants as unsympathetic figures.</TE>
<TE>   Zimring also felt that jurors, by convicting Knoller of murder,
were "creating a moral equivalence between conduct that may be
dangerous but doesn't intend deadly harm, and people who are trying
to take lives or risk lives intentionally."</TE>
<TE>   Dale Sanderson, a deputy district attorney in Santa Clara County,
disagreed, saying he did not believe there were strong grounds for
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence speaks for itself, and the verdict is appropriate,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sanderson prosecuted a case in 1989 in which a defendant, Michael
Berry, was charged with murder, but the jury returned a verdict of
manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   Berry's pit bull killed a toddler who wandered onto Berry's
property. But the dog was chained in the yard and Berry had warned
the toddler's parents about the dogs' viciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Berry's defense attorney, Phil Pennypacker, said he thought the
Knoller case did not rise to the level of murder.</TE>
<TE>   "[Knoller] lost control of a dog who weighed many, many pounds and
was very, very muscular," he said. "It's like punishing somebody for
not thinking through the consequences of what could have happened."</TE>
<TE>   If appellate courts affirm Knoller's murder conviction, Sanderson
said the verdict may prompt prosecutors elsewhere to charge dog
owners with murder in mauling cases.</TE>

<HD>More Passengers Enjoying the Ride as OCTA Leaves Troubles
Behind</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Survey shows 54% of riders are pleased,
proving the agency has overcome furor over rates, routes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County bus ridership has increased at a rapid pace over the
last year, a sign that the furor over fare increases and radically
altered routes may have subsided.</LD>
<LD>   After suffering declining ridership in 2000, the number of
passengers using Orange County's bus system grew by 10% last
year--the sharpest increase of any major metropolitan area in the
nation, according to the American Public Transit Assn.</LD>
<LD>   An unrelated Orange County Transportation Authority ridership
survey released Friday underscores the apparent shift in attitudes
regarding the sweeping overhaul of the county's bus routes.</LD>
<TE>   The survey, in which 12,500 riders participated, shows 54% of bus
passengers are generally pleased with the system, an increase of 8
percentage points from 1998.</TE>
<TE>   However, riders said they wanted more routes, stepped-up weekend
service and a less cumbersome system for transferring.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to have better and more frequent service, cleaner buses,
better connections and more on-time service," said Art Leahy, OCTA's
chief executive officer and a former bus driver. "If we do things
right, we expect ridership to climb. We have a wonderful trend here."</TE>
<TE>   The surveys were distributed to riders as they boarded buses, and
the questions related to rider preferences and demographics, not trip
origins and final destinations.</TE>
<TE>   Bus riders were critical and confused when OCTA rolled out its
point-to-point bus routes. Passengers said the system, which carved
meandering bus routes into straight lines, was befuddling, leaving
them stranded or dashing across streets to transfer to another bus.
OCTA has since altered some routes to make the network flow more
smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   "Where straight-lining worked, they kept it," said Jane Reifer, a
member of Transit Advocates of Orange County and initially a critic
of the revamped routes. "Where it didn't, they tweaked it. They've
begun connecting some of the old routes again, and that's pleasing."</TE>
<TE>   Ridership in 2001 increased 10%, far ahead of increases in Los
Angeles (7.45%) and New York (5.65%). Atlanta, Cleveland, Dallas and
Denver experienced a decline in ridership through the first three
quarters of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA reported that more than 61 million people boarded buses in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   The pattern appears to be holding. Last month, there were roughly
4.7 million bus boardings--a 20.6% increase over the same period a
year ago</TE>
<TE>   Passengers surveyed also expressed satisfaction with the bus books
and OCTA's Web site, though they indicated they would like more
information posted at stops.</TE>
<TE>   George Urch, an OCTA spokesman, said directors will probably
respond to riders' wishes at their Monday meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "We plan to add more service to the busier routes," Urch said. "We
need to put more information at our bus stops and we want to make
improving transfers a priority."</TE>
<TE>   Urch said 24-hour service is a possibility for some routes.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA also compiled a profile of the typical bus riders. Roughly
56% are women and about 60% are Latino. Most are headed to work and
do not have an available car.</TE>

<HD>A Mammoth Job: Grooming the Mountain</HD>
<DH>Snow cat operators prowl the slopes at night, combing and
coaxing the 'Sierra cement' into the perfect stuff for skiers and
snowboarders.</DH>

<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MAMMOTH LAKES</DL>
<LD>"This will be the last pass," Chad Senior announces on his hand-held
radio. With that, he whirls the big snow cat back down the mountain
under the starlit sky.</LD>
<LD>   Three other cats follow on his wing in tight formation, each of
them plowing the slope, munching moguls in their path, turning the
disheveled ski run into a seamless, manicured playground.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a good night when you get everything looking sweet," Senior
says, his spotlight scrutinizing the neat furrows left in his wake.
"And then you can go out and ski it the next day."</LD>
<TE>   Such is the life of the workers who groom this shaggy beast called
Mammoth Mountain. Every night during ski season, which usually runs
from November through May, they are on the mountain with their
machines, shaving spindrifts, patching bald spots, smoothing ragged
edges.</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen snow cats. Two shifts a night. Each one laying down
perfect corduroy, as their operators like to say. That's the look of
the finished product after their machines scrape, chop, pulverize,
flatten and then feather the finish with a giant comb attached to the
back end.</TE>
<TE>   Snow grooming has come a long way since the days when young men
attacked the slopes with picks and shovels.</TE>
<TE>   The high-tech machines are the snow-worthy cousins of the
agricultural combine, rigged with various attachments for different
tasks.</TE>
<TE>   Mammoth has a pair of winch cats, which can be hooked to concrete
slabs buried on the top of the 11,053-foot mountain and then lowered
by giant cables to groom the steepest pitches.</TE>
<TE>   One of the cats has an attachment known as a Pipedragon that every
night gives fresh haircuts to the half-pipes in the
skateboarding-inspired obstacle course that allow skiers and
snowboarders to catch "big air."</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, officials deploy mainline groomers who plow as many as
1,000 acres a night, canvassing all of the beginner and intermediate
ski runs and many of the expert runs.</TE>
<TE>   "We leave some runs with bumps," says Clifford Mann, director of
mountain maintenance. "And I get a lot of letters about that." Most
skiers, he said, and nearly all snowboarders, want an immaculately
groomed run, because it's easier to ski, and ski fast.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the product skiers want most," says Mann, who has worked on
Mammoth's slopes for 35 of his 50 years. "When the snow is soft, we
make it harder. When it's hard, we make it softer. We give them a
smoothly tilled, corduroy slope."</TE>
<TE>   Like other big resorts, Mammoth takes snow grooming
seriously--because it has to. Mann and his crews closely watch
national surveys for skier satisfaction. Mammoth averages 8.5 on a
10-point scale for skiers' satisfaction with its grooming. The
national average is 7.6.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason for such attention is the type of snow that
drifts down from the heavens. Unlike the light, champagne powder that
dusts resorts in Utah and sometimes Colorado, fresh snow at Mammoth
is in a category of its own--affectionately called Sierra cement.</TE>
<TE>   Dense and heavy, the snow tends to last far longer than the fluffy
stuff in the Rockies. It's one of the reasons Mammoth Mountain stays
open longer, occasionally offering skiing all the way through the
Fourth of July. But it takes more intensive grooming to keep it in
shape.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Senior, 28, is out there on snowy nights as well as
clear ones, leading a team of four grooming cats, which lumber on
wide tank tracks across the broad bowls that make Mammoth a favorite
of skiers from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   A cloud of loose snow swirls around the cat as its front blade
scoops a layer of fresh snow into the gaps between moguls.</TE>
<TE>   It's a cold, clear Saturday night but hard to see the stars with
all the snow being stirred up. Windshield wipers slap at the cats'
wind screens and back windows in a vain attempt to keep them clean.</TE>
<TE>   A pair of coyotes lope across the ski run ahead, caught briefly by
headlights before disappearing into the shadows. Senior pays them no
mind.</TE>
<TE>   "A good operator always has his blade turning over the snow," he
says, showing off his four years' experience at the controls. He
pulls levers and works a joystick, keeping the blade and tiller at
the precise depth and cant needed for each bend and twist in the
slope.</TE>
<TE>   The tiller mounted behind the cat chews steadily through snow and
chunks of ice in its path. A row of metal teeth grinds everything
into uniform fine-mesh kernels, which are then finished by the
plastic comb.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to have the flattest, most skiable snow," Senior
says, "stuff that will hold a [ski] edge so you can carve a nice
turn."</TE>
<TE>   The work can be monotonous, he says, but satisfying, as similar
activity may be for farmers who take pride in plowing perfectly
straight rows.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, at Colorado resorts such as Vail, snow groomers come
largely from the ranks of sodbusters. Farm boys who spend their
summers behind tractors on the Great Plains migrate to the Rockies in
winter to make a little extra cash driving the snow cats.</TE>
<TE>   Here in California, it's not so much about the money. It's about
living the life. Senior, like most seasonal workers, has that glint
in his eye of the hopelessly addicted skier, or in his case,
snowboarder. His compensation includes a season ski pass.</TE>
<TE>   Although his 4 p.m.-to-midnight shift cuts into his night life, he
has the days free to carve up the slopes he helped coif the night
before.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to test the product," he says, his eyes sparkling.
"Quality control."</TE>

<HD>Riverside Hospital in Critical Condition</HD>
<DH>Health care: Facility officials say inspectors overreacted
to problems. Most nurses have quit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A rare disciplinary action by state and industry inspectors has put a
Riverside hospital on the brink of failure by driving away funding,
staff and patients.</LD>
<LD>   Inspectors cited dramatic deficiencies in training, medical
procedures and other matters at Parkview Community Hospital earlier
this year. The result: Several Parkview departments, including the
emergency room, are closed--and by Friday occupancy had dwindled to
27 of 193 beds.</LD>
<LD>   Hospital officials contend the inspectors are overreacting in
order to set an example.</LD>
<TE>   "Which is not to say we don't have problems," Parkview spokesman
David Jarrard said. "We readily admit there are things we could do
better, but we don't think the penalty fit the crime."</TE>
<TE>   Reports that detail the hospital's inadequacies will not be public
for weeks. But accreditation inspectors say that in general the
hospital lacked effective leadership, had poor training for staffers
and inadequate procedures to ensure appropriate decisions were being
made for patient care. In a move that happens to less than 1% of all
hospitals surveyed, the hospital received a temporary denial of
accreditation.</TE>
<TE>   The problems began after inspectors from the state Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services and the private Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations began a three-day visit
Jan. 28. The two agencies conducted separate but simultaneous
inspections under a pilot program designed to tighten hospital
regulation standards.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the state inspectors concluded the private nonprofit
hospital had so many problems that it posed "immediate jeopardy" to
patient safety. As a result, Parkview was stripped of its ability to
bill Medi-Cal and Medicare programs.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital organization followed suit, notifying Parkview
officials Feb. 8 that it could lose accreditation, which is required
to receive reimbursement under most health insurance contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be amazing if the hospital is able to survive this," said
Dr. William Jones, Parkview's chief of staff. "We were already on the
edge. Every dollar that came in went out. So this--this has been
devastating."</TE>
<TE>   Since delivering the bad news, the state and accreditation
agencies have given Parkview conditional reprieves. But state
inspectors will return to the hospital May 15 and have warned that
marked improvement must be shown if the hospital is to keep treating
Medicare and Medi-Cal patients, who historically have made up nearly
70% of the hospital's patients.</TE>
<TE>   But it may be too late to undo the damage, Jarrard said. Fearful
of layoffs to come, most of the hospital's nursing staff took other
jobs, forcing the hospital to close its emergency room, pediatric and
cancer units.</TE>
<TE>   Neighboring hospitals are scrambling to fill the gap. They've
hired more employees, many from Parkview. Still, waits are as long as
six to eight hours in some emergency rooms. Nearby Riverside
Community Hospital sees an extra 20 emergency patients a day, said
hospital spokeswoman Ann Matich.</TE>
<TE>   The problem has become so dire that Riverside County is
considering taking over Parkview's emergency room--assuming the rest
of the hospital can remain in business.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials have responded to the crisis by lashing out at
state inspectors. They charge that in an effort to set tough new
standards, inspectors went overboard, inflating problems and
delivering a punishment so harsh it amounts to a deathblow.</TE>
<TE>   "When you damage the reputation of a hospital," Jarrard said,
"when you force it to close its ER, cut off [insurance
reimbursement], you just about close a hospital."</TE>
<TE>   Parkview, caught in a cutthroat health-care market that has killed
many other hospitals in the state, has been in financial decline for
years. Since 1995 the hospital's annual revenue has dropped by about
$30 million, Jarrard said. Some suppliers refuse to do business with
the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Parkview has become increasingly important to
uninsured patients in Riverside after the county general hospital
moved in 1995 to the adjacent city of Moreno Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the struggles, organizations representing the county's
doctors and emergency medical personnel say the hospital has a solid
reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "They've always been a very good partner to this community," said
Deloris Green, executive director of the Riverside County Medical
Assn., which represents more than 750 doctors. "Physicians have full
confidence in Parkview. We wouldn't have admitted patients there if
we didn't."</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to imagine not having Parkview around," added Michael
Osur, a paramedic and director of the Emergency Medical Services
Agency. "They are a needed part of this community."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, past inspections turned up no significant problems at
Parkview. Hospital officials say the problems with the state and the
Joint Commission appeared out of the blue.</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors for the state told the hospital in a Feb. 14 letter
that it had until March 4 to correct problems found in nursing
services, pharmacy services, quality assurance and the medical staff.
Unsatisfied with the hospital's response, inspectors then forbade
Parkview to participate in the government-funded health-care
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Overnight, Parkview lost the bulk of its funding. Private insurers
were also forced to pull out since most of their contracts require
the hospital to have Joint Commission accreditation and be eligible
for the Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. Medi-Cal is California's
version of Medicaid.</TE>
<TE>   After much lobbying from hospital officials and local
representatives, including Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Corona), state
inspectors agreed earlier this month to take another look at
Parkview. Inspectors agreed the most immediate dangers to patients
had been removed and gave the hospital until May 15 to correct other
problems, said Cindy Graunke, spokeswoman for the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid.</TE>
<TE>   The Joint Commission also changed the hospital's accreditation
status to conditional approval, subject to further reviews in the
coming year.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital staffers, who have been wearing blue ribbons in a show of
support for the hospital, said they are upset with the way the
inspectors handled this year's visit. Many contend that inspectors
went out of their way to find fault because of a 1999 state report
that urged them to more aggressively oversee accreditation
inspections.</TE>
<TE>   Problem areas cited were generally minor offenses, they said, and
seemed to focus mainly on routine issues regarding how medicine was
administered.</TE>
<TE>   "All of this was supposedly done in the name of patient safety,"
Jarrard said. "But by forcing the hospital to close its ER ...
[inspectors] put patients at a much greater risk. That's the irony."</TE>

<HD>Priest Fired as Head of School</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Encino dismissal follows allegations that he
molested two students and other youths in the 1970s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON and MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A priest has been dismissed from his position as president of an
Encino Catholic boys school after allegations that he sexually abused
two students and several other minors more than two decades ago,
officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The Rev. Dominic Savino was ousted from the presidency of Crespi
Carmelite High School and from acting as a priest by the Order of
Carmelites, which operates the school, after it learned of
allegations of sexual abuse. Authorities said that the abuse of the
students occurred in 1979 and that the other cases also occurred
during the 1970s.</LD>
<LD>   Savino, who was once the school's resident psychotherapist, was
appointed president in January 2001. His case was brought to
authorities' attention last week when a woman who said her twin boys
were abused by Savino on a school field trip contacted a new church
abuse hotline.</LD>
<TE>   The order, in a frank letter to "Members of Crespi Carmelite High
School family," said an internal investigation revealed the other
incidents of sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Savino, 63, is the latest priest to be swept up in the wave of
sexual abuse cases that has enveloped the Roman Catholic Church in
recent months. On Thursday, Pope John Paul II decried the abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The Very Rev. Leo McCarthy, the Carmelite provincial in Chicago,
wrote in announcing Savino's dismissal: "In this Lenten season in
diocese after diocese the U.S. church has been burdened and besieged
by a most serious matter--a series of reports of sexual misconduct
with minors by members of the clergy. I am very saddened to inform
you this issue has now reached this community."</TE>
<TE>   School officials said they reported Savino to the Los Angeles
Police Department's sexually exploited child unit. "Father Dominic
has cooperated with our investigation and acknowledged there were
some incidents that took place and he did seek psychotherapy and
counseling," said the Rev. Joe Fitzgerald, alumni relations director.
"When we became aware, as is our policy, we contacted law
enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously we are devastated," said Fitzgerald. "I went to school
here. I've known Father Dominic for several years."</TE>
<TE>   In a move to help boost confidence, the Rev. Augustine Carter, the
school's founding principal, took the post of acting president
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The mother of the former students telephoned a new hotline set up
by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles to receive and process information
about allegations of clerical sexual misconduct with minors. The
archdiocese, which has no authority over the Carmelite school, passed
the allegations to the order.</TE>
<TE>   Fitzgerald said Savino went through counseling and psychotherapy
after the incidents, and as far as the order is aware, there had not
been another reported case since that time.</TE>
<TE>   "In his case the treatment helped him and it paid off," Fitzgerald
said.</TE>
<TE>   However, the school is continuing an active investigation into
Savino, according to Friday's letter</TE>
<TE>   Under a policy established by the order in 1982, Savino has been
removed from the active ministry, offered counseling and is under the
watch of another priest 24 hours a day, Fitzgerald said. "He's still
in Los Angeles," Fitzgerald said. "He needs to be for a further
investigation by the authorities."</TE>
<TE>   In Friday's letter, Carmelite leader McCarthy offered an apology.
"The Carmelites believe that we must act responsibly and
compassionately to all victims of sexual misconduct, their families
and their communities, who are devastated by this behavior. On behalf
of the Carmelites I apologize to all who are affected by the tragedy
of clerical sexual misconduct with minors."</TE>
<TE>   Savino, ordained as a Carmelite priest in 1958, came to the school
in 1977 as part-time counselor; he previously worked at De Sales High
School in Louisville, Ky., and served as director of the Carmelite
community in Rome.</TE>
<TE>   He left Crespi in 1986 to get a doctorate in psychology and
subsequently went into private practice in the San Fernando Valley.
He returned to Crespi as the school's resident psychotherapist in
1995.</TE>
<TE>   Crespi's 492 students were notified during a 12:45 p.m. assembly
in the school gymnasium Friday. Fitzgerald said a stunned silence
fell over the gym.</TE>
<TE>   "The students are depressed and confused, but mainly sad,"
Fitzgerald said. "Some of them are still in shock. Father Dominic was
very popular here."</TE>
<TE>   "He was a really warm guy. Just a really nice man," said Matt
Gotts man, 15, a Crespi sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   Counselors were on hand Friday afternoon to discuss the issue with
students and others.</TE>
<TE>   They will conduct another session on the clerical sexual abuse
Sunday afternoon on the campus. Fitzgerald said the school will not
ignore the victims' plight. He said, "We are trying to find as many
victims as we can."</TE>

<CX>   Catholic priest--A story in Saturday's California section about the
Rev. Dominic Savino being fired as president of Crespi Carmelite High
School over allegations that he had molested students incorrectly
reported that two boys were allegedly molested during a school field
trip. That incident allegedly occurred during an outing that was not
sponsored by the school. In addition, the school's sexual abuse policies
were established in 1992, not 1982.</CX>

<HD>Highly Paid L.A. Council Gets a Raise</HD>
<DH>Wages: Members, who already make more than comparable
officials nationwide, will get 5% boost by 2003. Salaries are tied to
judges' pay.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council, already the highest paid council in the
nation, will get pay increases totaling 5% over two years, officials
said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Some council members said they were uncomfortable with receiving a
pay raise when a hiring freeze has been imposed on city staff and
officials are struggling with a potential budget deficit. Their pay
will grow from $133,051 a year to $139,784 by July 1, 2003.</LD>
<LD>   "I asked, 'How do we get a pay raise when we have a budget
crisis?'" Councilman Dennis Zine said.</LD>
<TE>   The answer: Voters approved a measure in 1990 that took salary
decisions out of the hands of elected officials and tied the salaries
to the pay of local judges. The city's 15 council members get the
same salary as Superior Court judges. The controller receives 10%
more, while the city attorney receives an additional 20%. The mayor
earns 30% more than the jurists.</TE>
<TE>   Since that measure passed 12 years ago, council salaries have more
than doubled.</TE>
<TE>   The latest pay boost, triggered when the state approved raises for
the judges, will increase the salary for Mayor James K. Hahn from
$172,966 to $181,719 by July 2003.</TE>
<TE>   By that same date, City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo and Controller
Laura Chick will also receive 5% raises, boosting their salaries to
$167,740 and $153,762, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Starting this week and retroactive to September, council members'
salaries were bumped up about 2.5% to $136,224, and the mayor's pay
was set at $177,091.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Wong, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said Hahn will accept the
raise, but declined to comment further. The salary increase will
bring him within the range of pay for New York City's mayor, which is
$195,000 a year. However, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire
businessman, is accepting only $1 a year.</TE>
<TE>   The size of city officials' salaries and the way they are set drew
criticism from taxpayer advocates, including Jon Coupal, president of
the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "They are way out of line with what is the norm nationally,"
Coupal said.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to council members' salaries, no city comes close.</TE>
<TE>   New York City's 51 council members receive an annual salary of
$90,000.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago, the nation's third-largest city, pays $85,000 to its 50
alder members, and Philadelphia pays most of its 17 council members
$80,000, although the council president gets $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Coupal argued there is no accountability in automatically tying
council members' salaries to judges' pay.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clearly not based on performance," he said. "It's based on
other peoples' performance and needs.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a complete taxpayer disconnect in this process."</TE>
<TE>   The provision tying salaries to judges' pay was part of
Proposition H, an ethics-reform package that also banned council
members from receiving honoraria and outside earned income. Council
members were responsible for including the pay formula in the
measure. Some reformers thought it was their attempt to sour voters
on the proposition by providing for huge pay increases. At the time,
council members were paid $61,222 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Butcher, general manager of Service Employees International
Union Local 347, the largest city employees union, said that although
Proposition H has boosted salaries, it has been worthwhile for the
reforms it brought to City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   None of the council members had notified the controller by Friday
that they would not be accepting the raise.</TE>
<TE>   "The voters of this city decided over a decade ago that they
wanted to avoid the political spectacle and the political
grandstanding that goes along with this type of issue," said
Councilman Jack Weiss. "I don't have any intent to disrupt what the
voters decided. It's a matter of the operation of law."</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski said that the council has approved
pay raises for all other city employees despite the budget problems.
Members of Butcher's union received 4% more last July, will get 2%
this July, and an additional 2% in July 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski, who is married to multimillionaire developer Doug
Ring, said she will accept the pay increase because she, too, does
not want to make a big deal of the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm accepting it only because there are other members of the
council who really need it," Miscikowski said. Councilman Eric
Garcetti said he does not want to grandstand by turning down the
increase.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the biggest council districts in the country," Garcetti
said. "And maybe we can work out in the future a mechanism where [our
salaries] are not pegged to the judges' salaries, but we are not
voting on that now. I donate probably 20% of my salary to charity as
it is. I feel fine."</TE>

<HD>County Home Sales, Prices Set Records</HD>
<DH>Economy: The number of local houses sold in February jumps
36% as buyers try to beat an expected increase in interest rates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Overcoming the usual wintertime blues, Ventura County's housing
market surged to record levels in February as buyers tried to beat an
increase in mortgage interest rates expected as the national economy
recovers this year.</LD>
<LD>   "It's safe to say this is the best February ever for Ventura
County," said John Karevoll, analyst for DataQuick Information
Systems Inc. of La Jolla. "Normally, there's a lull right after the
holidays. It's very slow. This time, we've got February numbers we
wouldn't normally see until summer."</LD>
<LD>   County home sales and prices increased more last month than in any
February since DataQuick began keeping figures in 1988. The number of
homes sold was up 36% and prices were 20% higher compared with the
same month a year ago, according to DataQuick, which counts sales at
the close of escrow.</LD>
<TE>   "It's clearly a situation where people are just trying to get into
the market before it's too late," Karevoll said. "They're afraid the
market will get away from them. If interest rates go higher, a lot of
people who are able to buy today won't be able to six months down the
road."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County owners sold 1,233 houses and condominiums last
month, up from 905 for February 2001 and nearly three times more than
in the same month a decade ago, when the county was entering an
eight-year slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   The county's median home price--the point at which half the homes
sell for more and half for less--reached $303,000 in February
compared with $253,000 a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Both the sales and price numbers are also up sharply from the
month before, even though the January figures were the highest for
that month since 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's increases were the highest reported in the region
so far, Karevoll said. Sales outstripped a 21% increase in Los
Angeles County, and hikes of 29% and 24% in Orange and San Diego
counties, respectively. Price jumps from a year ago ranged from 11%
to 15% in those three large counties, DataQuick reported.</TE>
<TE>   "There's clearly a migration of money from stocks and bonds to
real estate, because it's a safer bet," Karevoll said. "And, right
now, the return on money invested in housing is much better than any
other investment."</TE>
<TE>   That isn't likely to change soon, said Mark Schniepp, director of
the California Economic Forecast in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "People understand that prices aren't going down, [interest] rates
are going up and this is the time to get in," he said. "Prices aren't
going to erode given the recovery that's underway. And we've seen how
high prices can get in the Bay Area. We're a long way from that in
Ventura County."</TE>
<TE>   To see why the housing market is on such a run, consider the cost
of a loan on the typical $303,000 Ventura County home today, compared
with 1989, when the median home price was $215,000, Karevoll said.</TE>
<TE>   With a 20% down payment, that $242,000 loan today would come with
a monthly payment of $1,534 for 30 years, he said. In February 1989,
when buyers paid a mortgage rate of 10.86%, the typical $172,000 loan
would have had monthly payments of $1,620, he said.</TE>
<TE>   That is without taking into account a jump of about 38% in the
cost of living since 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "This illustrates why things are going so well," Karevoll said.</TE>

<LD>March has been a violent month in the region. From March 8 to 13, 13
people were killed in the Los Angeles area in 11 unrelated shootings.
As more than 300 students sat in the Inglewood High School auditorium
Monday, Principal Adriana McNally spoke to them about the weekend
shooting death of Jermaine Deandre Simon, their classmate. According
to Inglewood police, Simon, 18, was killed during a dispute outside a
Jack in the Box restaurant in Inglewood. Placed on the stage of the
auditorium was a chair, draped in Simon's No. 3 football jersey, and
a football. A 2000 All-Ocean League running back, Simon had been
scheduled, the morning of the assembly, to register at a community
college in Fresno. The following is the text of McNally's talk.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Young people, at times like this, we ask ourselves "Why?" What if?
If only. The problem is in finding the answer to what we do now and
dealing with our grief.</LD>
<TE>   I have seen so many sad students on campus today, especially young
men. Let me tell my young men that it's all right to cry. Crying is a
sign of strength.</TE>
<TE>   There are other ways to express your grief too. Some of you may
want to talk. Others--as I had a young man do earlier this
morning--may want to write a letter to Jermaine.</TE>
<TE>   Now there may be some of you who may say, "Oh, that's stupid!" But
while the body is not here, the spirit is.</TE>
<TE>   Still others of you may prefer being alone. And that's all right.
Just do what you must to give yourself some sense of peace.</TE>
<TE>   Many of you are searching for an understanding. It will come,
though it may take a longer period of time.</TE>
<TE>   At a later time, we'll find a fitting memorial for Jermaine. But
as a group, we have to find a way to make our world better.</TE>
<TE>   I don't think that you young people know the pain we as parents,
administrators, coaches, teachers feel as so many of the young die
violently.</TE>
<TE>   A young man said to me this morning, "Jermaine is not my first
homie to die. He won't be my last."</TE>
<TE>   But I don't want you so cavalier about violence. We must find
answers.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know why this happened. "Why?" is not in the equation.
"It's not fair" is not in the equation.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever you hold on to as dear, turn to it now. We are all in
this together. This is not the time for independence; this is the
time for interdependence. I want you to focus on what you know as
positive, on what will propel you forward.</TE>
<TE>   I knew Jermaine for a short time. What I remember about him was
that he was always respectful toward adults and that he was always
happy. Hold on to those memories.</TE>
<TE>   I leave you to your thoughts. Talk to one another. Hug one
another. Today, you are sad. That's all right. But joy does come in
the morning. We are here for you. We'll be with you. And so it is.</TE>

<HD>A New Mall Helps Complete BeBeFaLa</HD>

<AU>ERICKA EISEN TULLIS</AU>
<BD>Ericka Eisen Tullis is a policy analyst at the UCLA
Center for Healthier Children, Families and Communities.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My husband and I moved into our house near Beverly Boulevard between
Fairfax and LaBrea, the area my husband and his best friend call
BeBeFaLa, a little over a year ago. We had been living in Laurel
Canyon for several years and were tired of having to get in the car
to drive down the hill every time we ran out of dog food.</LD>
<LD>   On the first and especially the second time I saw the house we
would eventually buy, my ears were so distracted by voices in my head
telling me the monthly mortgage would be too high that I didn't
notice the sounds of jackhammers and bulldozers a mere two blocks
away.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after moving in, however, I became all too aware of the
sounds associated with the birth of the Grove, or what a large
temporary banner posted at the construction site informed me would
soon be my "Outdoor Shopping and Entertainment Resort."</LD>
<TE>   The Grove opened a week ago, and I have to admit that I have mixed
feelings about it.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-consumer in me is disgusted, even outraged, by the
thought of what is, despite its clever self-description, essentially
a shopping mall. It has imported the usual suspects such as Banana
Republic, Crate &amp; Barrel and Nordstrom to what was previously a
street notable for Ross Dress for Less and, charmingly, Anna's
Linens.</TE>
<TE>   The New Yorker in me, however, is excited about, even grateful
for, being able to walk, yes, walk, to a 14-screen theater complex
and a multitude of restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   The Grove is everything I hate about Los Angeles (chain stores,
parking lots) mixed in with all the things I've longed for since
moving here five years ago: evening strolls home from the movies,
Christmas shopping nearby, restaurants within a block of each other,
and all within two blocks of my house.</TE>
<TE>   During the construction period, helicopters had been a regular
presence in the sky above my house, and not just the usual
helicopters going to and from the nearby Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
These were helicopters that dropped off various objects too large to
have been brought to the inner sanctum of the resort by other means.</TE>
<TE>   Optimist that I am, I had taken to thinking of these helicopters
as carrier pigeons, albeit loud ones, that brought messages of
friendship and goodwill to the residents of my area from the mall's
developers.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't worry," they cooed reassuringly, "it's really going to be
fun!"</TE>
<TE>   I know not all my neighbors see it that way. Most see the presence
of the Grove only as increasing traffic or worsening already scarce
parking on our little street. Others are ethically opposed to the
gentrification they feel is represented by the Grove. Still others
resent their view of the western sky being partially blocked by the
Grove's five-level parking structure.</TE>
<TE>   But I tell myself, and the neighbors I've spoken to about it, that
the Grove will enhance our area, and I don't mean just by increasing
property values and saving us from ever having to go to the Beverly
Center again.</TE>
<TE>   No, when the jackhammers, bulldozers and helicopters were replaced
by idling Hondas and Mercedes-Benzes waiting to make their turns into
the parking structure on Stanley Avenue, I arrived on foot to do some
window shopping, lay down a little cash, but mostly just to look for
something that reminds me of a real, old-fashioned neighborhood.</TE>

<HD>An Assimilated Jew's Connection With an Old Tradition</HD>
<DH>"CLIMBING JACOB'S LADDER" By Alan Morinis; Broadway, 226
pages, $23.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUTH ANDREW ELLENSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What's a secularized Jew got to do to get a little bit of spiritual
enlightenment? Alan Morinis thinks he has the answer in "Climbing
Jacob's Ladder."</LD>
<LD>   The only problem, however, is that the Jewish teaching that
Morinis claims to rediscover, known as the Mussar Movement, was never
really lost. It just didn't exist in the world that Morinis knew.</LD>
<LD>   Like many assimilated Jews of the mid-20th century, Morinis had
come to a point in his life where the formality of the synagogue and
the sterility of some of its services left him feeling that Judaism
didn't offer any particular path toward what Eastern religions
consider enlightenment.</LD>
<TE>   After a series of setbacks suffered in midlife, he wished to
connect more deeply to his own spiritual tradition. It was a course
that spurred Morinis to rediscover Judaism in a way that offered, in
his mind, the same spiritual satisfaction he had encountered in
Hinduism, which he had studied as a Rhodes scholar at Oxford. In his
search he discovered the Mussar Movement.</TE>
<TE>   Mussar has roots in medieval Judaism, but it enjoyed a revival in
Eastern Europe during the early 19th century when Jews, granted civil
rights by the Napoleonic reforms, faced the prospect of becoming
secular and assimilated citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Some in the Orthodox world responded by reviving the Mussar
tradition in the hope of binding individuals to a more religious
life.</TE>
<TE>   A school of thought that emphasizes spiritual and ethical behavior
in the spirit of halakah, Jewish law, Mussar prescribes a regimen of
study, reflection and self-examination to subdue egotism and
selfishness and to force into sharp relief the true self so
practitioners can improve upon it.</TE>
<TE>   Mussar is not a mystical tradition per se, but in Morinis' eye, it
offers a similar goal to that of Hinduism, conveniently placed in a
Jewish package.</TE>
<TE>   Morinis erroneously assumed that the Mussar Movement had all but
disappeared in the flames of the Holocaust. It hadn't. Mussar had
primarily become a method for teaching children and had been
incorporated into the educational fabric of many yeshivas, centers of
traditional Jewish learning.</TE>
<TE>   Mussar exists in the Orthodox world, but Morinis, raised on
"gefilte fish and Milton Berle," had never encountered it.</TE>
<TE>   The steps he takes in order to attain spiritual fulfillment--to
"climb Jacob's ladder"--are thoughtfully detailed as a series of
metaphorical gates. Morinis clearly wants his readers to discover, as
he did, that the world is a holy place in every situation, and acts
of tzedek, or lovingkindness, can be performed anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   It is striking, however, that Morinis must go on a spiritual
journey to discover the sweetness of his own religion.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, in embracing Mussar, Morinis romanticizes the
Orthodox world as only a secular Jew who sees himself returning to
his roots could do.</TE>
<TE>   When he talks about bringing his wife, Bev, a doctor, to the home
of his teacher, Rabbi Yechiel Yitzchok Perr, he observes the strict
social separation of men and women.</TE>
<TE>   "The women we met were anything but docile or cowed by the roles
they had been assigned," he writes. "Many of them ... were bright,
educated, inquisitive, strong and even outspoken."</TE>
<TE>   If only that were the case: Though women do have a role in
traditional Orthodox Judaism, they are considered inferior
religiously to men, who are the only members of the community
entitled to study some of the spiritual truths Morinis holds dear.</TE>
<TE>   Much as Lis Harris did in "Holy Days," her account of Hasidic Jews
in Brooklyn, Morinis perceives the world of religious Jews as holding
a meaning and warmth not found in many places in our modern world,
and indeed, Judaism is an ethical guide for living that places an
emphasis on community.</TE>
<TE>   The Mussar Movement, however, is not entirely radical, and
Morinis' portrait of his spiritual growth, as deeply felt as it is,
is less revelatory than sensible, if one is to live a life of meaning
as an ethical and caring person.</TE>
<TE>   But "Climbing Jacob's Ladder" is a compelling portrait of the
relationship between a student and a teacher, and Morinis'
journey--as an assimilated Jew entering the Orthodox world of
yeshiva--raises important questions about the meaning of Judaism and
the search for spirituality in this world.</TE>
<TE>   The answers that Morinis finds with the help of Rabbi Perr form
the cornerstone of the author's transformation and the heart of his
real story.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It is hardly a secret that too many U.S. global aid dollars have
disappeared into political rat holes, mainly the pockets of autocrats
and their corrupt buddies. The best response, however, is not to get
out of the aid business but to direct the money to programs that
work.</LD>
<LD>   Two pending bills in Congress would do that. One would help
eradicate tuberculosis; the other establish "microcredit" programs,
small loans to village collectives that bypass corrupt governments
and offer aid to the hard-working poor.</LD>
<LD>   The TB bill, introduced Thursday by Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.)
and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.), would triple funding to fight
tuberculosis, from $75 million to $200 million, and ensure that all
of the money would go toward cost-effective programs. The Boxer/Smith
bill is a healthy antidote to a Bush administration proposal that
would actually reduce TB and malaria funding by one-third next year.</LD>
<TE>   Now is not the time for such a reduction. Although tuberculosis
has become the leading killer of young women and of people with AIDS
worldwide, only one in four people it afflicts currently have access
to proven, effective treatment. And as Boxer puts it, because the
bacterium is easily spread through the air, ''TB anywhere is a threat
everywhere.... It's just a plane ride away in our highly mobile
world.''</TE>
<TE>   The second bill, now being crafted by Rep. Tim Roemer (D-Ind.),
would earmark $200 million in annual aid for the sort of successful
"microcredit" programs that Jordan's Queen Rania al Abdullah
described Friday in Mexico at a summit on world poverty. Among them
are programs in the Sahel region of Africa just below the Sahara that
help women prepare baked goods during the "hungry season" between
harvests, Save the Children programs in Afghanistan that since 1995
have helped women make carpets and sew and sell clothing, and
"village banking" collectives worldwide in which 20 to 40 members,
mostly or all women, make short-term loans to people they know and
whom they can help to ensure that borrowers are successful enough to
repay the village bank with interest. Roemer's bill, wise to the
grabby tactics of many larger banks, would restrict the funding to
ensure that most of it gets to the very poor.</TE>
<TE>   TB, AIDS and malaria kill about 15,000 people every day, deepening
world poverty. About 1.3 billion people worldwide live on less than
$1 a day. As Queen Rania pointed out at the summit in Mexico, these
dual economic and health disasters have created a "fertile breeding
ground for desperation," a climate in which "terrorism often takes
root."</TE>
<TE>   Foreign aid alone is not a cure for terrorism--the world isn't
that simple. But these small and focused proposals by Sens. Boxer and
Gordon and Rep. Roemer would be sound investments in a more stable
world.</TE>

<HD>The Smog Maker by the Bay</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What would a Redlands resident say if Santa Monica motorists were
exempt from the state's stringent Smog Check II test because, with
all those ocean breezes, Santa Monica has no smog problem? Right. He
would say their exhaust gases just blow inland and become Redlands'
smog problem.</LD>
<LD>   Well, the folks in the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys feel the
same way about the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area. Since the
breezy Bay Area has no significant air pollution problem, motorists
are subject to only the simpler old-style smog check.</LD>
<LD>   Now the valleys are rebelling, citing studies that prove that the
Bay Area's pollution blows over the hills and into the inland region.
Inland air districts have sued the state to force the Bay Area to
adopt Smog Check II.</LD>
<TE>   Valley lawmakers introduced legislation this week to require the
Bay Area to adopt Smog Check II, in effect in Southern California and
the inland valleys since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Smog Check II requires vehicles to be tested at various engine
speeds for oxides of nitrogen on a treadmill device called a
dynamometer. The test boosts the cost of the smog check by about $10.
Generally, motorists have to get a smog check every two years,
although new vehicles are exempt for the first four years.</TE>
<TE>   Bay Area legislative leaders did not vow to try to kill AB 2637,
introduced by Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza (D-Merced) and a bipartisan
group of coauthors, nor did they give any indication of support. Bay
Area officials often complain that the valleys have been slow to
clean up their own pollution, including exhaust from farm vehicles.
Even so, Smog Check II in the Bay Area could reduce smog-contributing
substances by an estimated 14 tons a day in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   There are regional differences in air pollution, but the problem
of dirty air affects all Californians. The Bay Area should join the
fight.</TE>

<LD>Congratulations, Driggs, Idaho, for being selected the best place to
live in America by this month's Men's Journal. Condolences too. Now
that Driggs has been discovered, its ruin is assured. Wealthy
Californians and others will swoop in, buy up all the choice
property, build million-dollar mansions and drive Driggs' hapless 941
current residents out of their own housing market. Next will come
chi-chi spas, chain boutiques and a faux Alpine village at the ski
resort. Gone will be Driggs' wonderful combination bookstore and
stained glass place and maybe even Mike's Diner, featured in a
full-page photo.</LD>
<LD>   It's been happening for years. A sleepy town in an idyllic natural
setting gets "discovered" by Outside, Men's Journal or some other
outdoor recreation and adventure magazine. The resulting rush
overwhelms all the amenities that made it so livable in the first
place. Consider Aspen and Vail and Driggs' cousin just across the
Tetons, Jackson, Wyo. It long ago happened to Lake Tahoe.</LD>
<LD>   "The 50 Best Places to Live" in the March Men's Journal dealt only
with towns of fewer than 50,000 population, locales considered to be
the healthiest, safest, most fun in America. Familiar California
names are present: No. 3, Mammoth Lakes; No. 17, Santa Cruz, and No.
23, Truckee.</LD>
<TE>   And a new name appears at No. 40: Lone Pine, the 1,818-resident
burg astride U.S. 395 at the south end of the Owens Valley, gateway
to Mt. Whitney, an unpretentious place in an Ansel Adams setting, a
good lunch stop on the way to Mammoth and Sierra trout streams. A
delighted Lone Pine Chamber of Commerce official told the Owens
Valley newspaper he was surprised by the honor. Maybe it will boost
business a bit, he said. That would be fine. But, Lone Pine, be
careful what you wish for. We like you the way you are, the way you
were described in Men's Journal: "The anti-Los Angeles, with lots of
climbers."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, more climbers congregate around Bishop, another hour or
two up 395. Strangely, Bishop, "discovered" several years ago, did
not make the journal's 50. Or does that snubbing make our point?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I was dismayed to learn from your March 18 issue that the Bakersfield
City Council has decided to place the phrase "In God We Trust" on its
City Hall. Even more disturbing was the information that a new
Michigan law encourages placement of the phrase on public buildings,
that the Virginia Legislature has passed a bill requiring the state's
public schools to post the phrase and that some Florida school boards
have taken a similar action.</LD>
<LD>   Such actions defy the important principle of separation of church
and state that is embedded in our Constitution. They represent a
blatant attempt to use government funds to foster the acceptance of
the view of a religious majority in this country. The action is felt
justified because the phrase "In God We Trust" appears on our money.
This already ignores the constitutional mandate that government
should not support any religious views. But this continued, flagrant
action does not justify further expansion of the wrong.</LD>
<LD>   I strongly support the right of all citizens to adopt religious
beliefs if they so wish. Indeed, those who adhere to a religious
faith should welcome the separation of church and state that protects
their own freedom. As such, they should support an action to keep the
phrase "In God We Trust" from public buildings and, indeed, support
an action to remove the phrase from our money.</LD>
<TE>   Paul D. Boyer</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Bakersfield City Council has decided to put the words "In God
We Trust" on its City Hall. Placing those words on buildings or any
other thing does not buy God's blessing. Nurturing confidence,
responsibility and trust in ourselves is the key. We must make the
daily decisions that affect our existence and live up to them,
especially at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe God really is monitoring and manipulating us, based on our
behavior. But if so, wouldn't it seem that worthy deeds of
self-reliance and social improvement weigh more strongly than words
of imploringly blind faith? I prefer to focus on the slogan, "In
humans we trust"--and work toward the day we really can. That would
make God truly proud, whoever she, he, it or they may be.</TE>

<HD>Far East Cafe's Timeless Memories</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Little Tokyo Landmark Plans a Comeback," March 17: Cecilia
Rasmussen's article on the Far East Cafe caused me to think about
whether or not my grandfather was one of those young Japanese men
lined up outside the cafe on Saturday nights. The Far East Cafe
represented a place that our family shared Sunday dinners and, as we
grew older, it was the place that represented timelessness. Every
time we returned to share a meal, the high, wood-paneled booths
returned us to a time that was from our youth.</LD>
<LD>   I will always remember my younger sister clumsily eating a bowl of
rice in her high chair and having half of it end up on the floor
around her. That story was one of many we shared when we all
congregated on the mezzanine for my grandfather's wake. With the
ceiling fans slowly mixing the warm summer air with the sweet smells
from the kitchen below, my father said to everyone there, "Please eat
because this is where o-ji-chan [grandfather] wanted us to be, all
together sharing a meal."</LD>
<LD>   Thank you for resurrecting the memory of my grandfather--I can
even smell the almond chicken as I write. I can't wait to return with
my family to share more Sunday meals, retell all the old stories and
see if my sister, albeit a few years older, is a little more adept at
eating a bowl of rice.</LD>

<LD>The U.S. is fighting a war against terrorism, not terror. Even the
president has had this habit of inappropriate terminology. Is it
simply an effort to avoid uttering an extra syllable, at the expense
of accuracy? Actually, I'm afraid very few people see a difference.</LD>
<LD>   Come to think of it, being afraid isn't so great. Maybe we should
also launch a war against fear.</LD>
<LD>   And why is it that as soon as a tyrant or terrorist becomes well
known, references to the person are suddenly made with a first-name
convention? Since when has it been necessary to refer to Osama or
Saddam? I don't recall anyone having referred to Adolf, Benito or
Fidel.</LD>
<TE>   Finally, could someone please tell George that the word "nuclear"
is not pronounced nuke-you-ler? I know, he's not the first U.S.
president to mispronounce the word, and something tells me he won't
be the last.</TE>

<HD>SUVs: Tax Gas Based on Mileage</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thank you for John Balzar's excellent proposal to restrict bulky SUVs
to the slower truck lane (Commentary, March 17). As for the notion of
"increased vehicle fees," how about implementing a graduated air
quality tax whereby the cost of gasoline would be determined by the
vehicle's fuel efficiency: If a Ford Exposition averages 12 mpg and
my Toyota Corolla averages 36 mpg, it seems only fair that the
Exposition driver should pay three times as much for each gallon of
gas. That extra money could go toward treating the health and
environmental consequences of air pollution.</LD>
<LD>   Balzar's right on when he says, "If it's right to tax smokers,
it's just as right to tax SUVers for the same reasons." Besides that,
having to pay more than $5 per gallon of gas (to go only 12 miles)
would probably cure most of the current SUV mania and alleviate some
of the pressure on our environment.</LD>

<TE>   Balzar's piece raises an important question that is rarely heard
in the SUV debate--why should personal vehicle choice trump the
health and safety of the general public? We no longer allow smokers
to endanger the health of others in public places. Why should SUV
drivers be allowed, with impunity, to spew two and three times the
pollution of other vehicles into the air we all must breathe?</TE>
<TE>   Over a decade ago the California Legislature passed a bill that
would have increased registration fees on the most-polluting vehicles
and given rebates to the cleanest ones. The legislation was vetoed in
a shortsighted move by then-Gov. George Deukmejian, but the time has
come to revive the concept. If SUV drivers are going to contribute
disproportionately to our air pollution problems, then they should
also be paying more to help clean the air.</TE>

<TE>   Balzar tipped his hand with the highlighted excerpt, "Big guys on
the right, little guys on the left. It has a nice ring, doesn't it?"
He would have done better had he applied logic instead of the
worn-out left-wing habit of deciding how you "feel" about any issue,
social or political, before taking a position on it.</TE>
<TE>   I don't smoke and I don't own an SUV, but I know that some liberal
has a bad "feeling" about something else that I like to do or
something else I own, and somebody like Balzar will eventually try to
tax it beyond my means, take away the reason for doing it or owning
it, or take it away from me altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Balzar proposes to destroy some of our most precious freedoms and
uses the specious "research" of a biased newspaper writer to support
his views. As a result, Balzar is far more dangerous than carbon
monoxide or oxides of nitrogen.</TE>

<TE>   Why is the assumption that SUVs are safer allowed to slide by
unchallenged? Statistically, SUVs and pickup trucks do not do a
better job of protecting their occupants, and their poor handling
characteristics increase the chance of a traffic collision.</TE>
<TE>   I know many fine people who purchased large SUVs under the
mistaken assumption that they were doing something to protect their
loved ones. Pickup trucks and SUVs only protect the automobile
manufacturers from having to be more efficient and responsible.</TE>

<TE>   Finally someone has eloquently expressed my view of SUVs, or AHVs,
as I refer to them (absurdly humongous vehicles).</TE>
<TE>   I am sick and tired of blindly following a Navigator or Escalade
and not being able to see what is going on ahead in traffic. Whatever
happened to the concept of defensive driving, scanning ahead to see
what's happening down the road?</TE>
<TE>   For those of us who still drive Corollas, driving defensively now
means trying to not get sideswiped by some idiot in an AHV who forgot
to check his blind spot and didn't bother to use that little lever on
the left side of the steering column (yes, folks, the turn signal was
meant to let the folks around you know what your intentions are).
Let's call a truck a truck, let's tax a status symbol luxury vehicle
as a luxury vehicle and let's pass legislation raising minimum
mileage standards for these gas-guzzling, environment-polluting,
resource-wasting behemoths.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Walter Russell Mead's "A Bullish Diplomacy" (Opinion, March 17) was a
prime example of the sort of American blindness that is our principal
problem with respect to the Muslim world in this century and the
last. He seems to think, in the teeth of world opinion as witnessed
in the compendium of the foreign press on Page 3 in the same section,
that the opposition to our proposed adventures in Iraq is all a sham
and that when the bombs start to fall, "a reasonable degree of
support from a reasonable number of key allies" will magically
materialize. It won't. The Arabs are adamant on that point--take, for
example, the front-page interview with King Abdullah of Jordan. And
no one but the English in Europe is being even polite about the Bush
administration's drumbeat for war in the Middle East.</LD>
<TE>   Mead thinks that the root cause of terrorism in the Middle East is
Iraq, which accords well with the Bush-Cheney doctrine of the evil
axis but totally misses the point that any number of Middle Eastern
commentators and politicians make. The root cause is the
unquestioning American support for the brutal Israeli occupation of
the Palestinian territories and the murder of their people. Until
someone in the American government says publicly that Ariel Sharon is
killing innocents in an unjust war of extinction against Muslim
people in what used to be their land, no one in the Middle East or
Europe will help us in our ambitions to oust Saddam Hussein. Vice
President Cheney has been confronted with the truth of the situation
in the Middle East, and he would do well to bring that truth home to
Washington.</TE>

<TE>   Re Mead's column: I am pleased to learn that the United States'
escalating global rampage is being conducted to bring safety and
freedom to the world. The "safety" is likely being achieved through
murdering thousands in Afghanistan, as well as threatening preemptive
nuclear attacks, while the "freedom" is no doubt being assured by
eliminating our constitutionally protected civil liberties. War is
peace. Slavery is freedom. Orwell would be laughing.</TE>

of Mead's fine article.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Nuclear Fears Abound," Opinion, March 17: Every time I open
the newspaper and read of the latest Bush administration posturing, I
cringe. Now it seems that the only thing the world really has to fear
is the United States' nuclear arsenal, which, by the time Bush is
done, will be huge. They have every right to be concerned.</TE>
<TE>   We Americans seemingly had few qualms about dropping the atom bomb
on the Japanese and, given this administration's views, we would have
even fewer. In his rush to rid the world of those "bad guys," Bush
seems to forget that the terrorists struck at the heart of this
country not with bombs but with our own airplanes. Dropping a few
nuclear bombs on one or two "axis of evil" countries will probably
not solve an escalating situation but will create an ever-expanding
war against what will be perceived as American aggression. This
sounds like the old bumper sticker: "He who dies with the most
(nuclear) toys wins." The question is . . . wins what?</TE>

<TE>   Re "New Nuclear Policy Makes for a Safer World," Commentary, March
18: Like snake oil salesmen in the past, Barry Blechman hawks his own
brand of salve with soothing-sounding gibberish in his article. The
new nuke policy is good, he says, because it "would move the U.S.
away from a single, integrated, operational plan for nuclear attacks
to 'capabilities-based targeting.' " Gee, I feel better already!</TE>
<TE>   This new nuke policy recognizes that Russia is no longer our
enemy, he swoons. But wait a minute! "U.S. Works Up Plan for Using
Nuclear Arms" (March 9) mentions that the secret report given to
Congress by the Pentagon states: "The Pentagon needs to be prepared
to use nuclear weapons against China, Russia, Iraq, North Korea,
Iran, Libya and Syria."</TE>
<TE>   Snake oil salesmen talk a good game, but who wants to swallow
their wares? Not me, that's for sure.</TE>

<LD>A child shot and killed. An innocent bystander wounded ("Slow-Motion
Mass Murder--Standing Up to Street Gangs," editorial, March 17). Both
are victims of another drive-by shooting. How many of these gutless,
cowardly acts does it take until we realize that we are all victims
of gang violence, of "domestic terrorism"?</LD>
<LD>   As our military roots out terrorism internationally, so must
domestic law enforcement agencies intensify their efforts to root
out, hunt down, cut off and kill the gangs, the evil, the domestic
terrorists who stalk our neighborhoods and keep us prisoners in our
own homes and who deny every citizen the constitutionally guaranteed
rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</LD>

<TE>   A decade ago, there seemed to be consensus on how to deal with
gangbangers and their senseless killings. Today, I'm not sure if
people haven't forgotten what they said they were going to do, or if
they've simply lost their will to deal with the problem. Here's a
quick tutorial on the subject of handling the "slow-motion mass
murder": 1) execute every convicted killer on death row--including
juveniles; 2) deploy military artillery in the war against drugs; 3)
arrest the parents of children who join gangs or commit violent
crimes; 4) break the cycle of poverty that drives most of today's
shootings.</TE>
<TE>   The alarming increase in the number of gang-related killings
shouldn't surprise anyone. With more kids having less to do each day,
it was only a matter of time before the death toll started rising
again. Unless law-abiding, taxpaying, voting citizens demand that
massive amounts of resources be redirected to meaningful
after-school, evening and weekend programs for young people, there
simply aren't going to be any safe neighborhoods left in Los Angeles.</TE>

<TE>   You lament that we have had 200 years to figure out ways to
eliminate domestic terrorism and pledge to discuss what works here
and elsewhere to quell gang violence. I hope you take a hard look at
the small but growing movement to legalize drug use. In the same way
that alcohol prohibition increased the price of liquor and helped
finance the gangs of a former era in U.S. history, today's
prohibition of drugs increases the price of what would otherwise be
cheap commodities and finances the gangs in our neighborhoods.</TE>

<LD>Saturday's editorial pages had two ironically related bookends: on
the left an editorial ("E-moting by E-Mail") and on the right "Geezer
at 40? Yes, if You're Job-Hunting," by Arlene Schindler (Voices). The
irony lay in the hidden cause-effect relationship between the two
phenomena being described and decried. The casual and inappropriate
use of e-mail is, I believe, a direct result of the flawed education
received, generally, by the younger types ruling the work force, at
least according to Schindler.</LD>
<LD>   As teaching the proper--and elegant and powerful--use of the
English language is gradually relaxed in our schools, the discipline
needed to use e-mail properly--and elegantly and powerfully--is
becoming rarer and rarer. The same writing skills that a solid
education (I'm talking junior high school, not graduate school)
should provide, along with a serious work environment (I'm talking
companies run by adults, not the children described by Schindler),
would give all the discipline needed to write good e-mail
correspondence.</LD>
<LD>   No SCREAMING CAPITAL LETTERS. No cutesy :( icons. Just good
English (or any other language) used in correspondence as it has been
for generations. Carelessness is the problem; poor education and lax
standards are the cause--not e-mail itself.</LD>

<LD>Re "The Davis Enigma: Success Comes Without Popularity," March 19:
The true measure of any governor should be in how effective he or she
is at governing. Gov. Gray Davis, when you add it all up, has done an
exceptional job in areas including environmental protection,
increasing the minimum wage, gay and lesbian rights, gun control,
improvement of roads and public infrastructure and education. He did
about as well as could be expected from anyone in handling the energy
crisis he inherited--steering us clear of the blackouts that were
projected.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, his approach to decision-making is slow and deliberate--he
thoughtfully takes the time to study issues and solicit input from
the community and experts. I've looked at his record and what he's
achieved in the last four years on issues important to me and to
California, and I think he has done well.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As I watched Davis' campaign against Richard Riordan, I saw how
shrewd his campaign manager was to bait Riordan into a battle with
Davis instead of battling his Republican opponents. Apparently, Davis
strategists knew something Riordan didn't, and that was if Riordan
had made it to the general election, many Democrats would have
defected.</TE>
<TE>   Many of us who are die-hard Democrats have been disappointed with
Davis' Republican-like position on many issues. Riordan, though a
registered Republican, was enough of a moderate to woo dissatisfied
Democrats. Bill Simon, on the other hand, is so conservative that he
is not likely to win over any Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   It's too bad Riordan didn't campaign against Simon from the
beginning. He was right about one thing--he was the Republican "Gray
Davis feared the most." Too bad for the rest of us that Riordan
decided to campaign against Davis eight months too soon.</TE>

<LD>Re "Copyright War: Find a Truce," editorial, March 19: Copy
protection schemes will fail. We are kidding ourselves if we believe
otherwise. I would surmise that the software and music industries
would even make more money if they didn't spend it on high-priced
consultants to change the law and to develop a technology that a
15-year-old geek cracks over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Where is reciprocity? The music and software industries do not
want us to copy their products, yet if the customer does not like the
CD or software bought, the industry refuses to take it back and
refund the customer's money. Clearly, if the consumer ends up
believing he/she is just a revenue unit for the benefit of the
industry, then what is wrong with getting a copy through alternative
means to make up for this injustice?</LD>
<LD>   Most insidious is the accelerating trend that the customer does
not own the software that he/she has bought but only has a license
for extremely limited use, which has been unilaterally crammed down
the throat of the consumer. Where are our ownership rights and the

<TE>   If the Hollywood producers of digital content on DVDs and CDs
really want to reduce digital piracy, all they have to do is charge a
fair and reasonable price for their product. As the manufacturers of
prerecorded videotapes found out, if the price is low enough, most
people would rather pay for the "real thing" rather than go through
the trouble of making an illegal copy. Only cheapskates who wouldn't
buy the movie anyhow will bother with piracy.</TE>
<TE>   The days of getting premium prices for a CD with only one or two
good tracks are drawing to a close. As long as the digital content
manufacturers insist on gouging the public for their product, they
will be engaged in a never-ending battle against digital piracy.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Calendar Can Leave Students Out in Cold" (March 17), about
students who are off-track in year-round schools: Walter Reed Middle
School, in North Hollywood, is scheduled to go year-round starting
this summer. To assist our parents in finding age-appropriate
activities so that our kids do not spend most of their off-track time
sitting around watching TV, we have set up a committee of parents and
school representatives to try to scour the city for programs. Most of
our students are too young for part-time employment, so we are
looking to place them as tutors and aides in local elementary schools
and in volunteer-service activities in the local community. We would
also like to create new programs, but funding and space are difficult
to find.</LD>
<LD>   The park programs, while well-intentioned, only meet from 11:30 to
2:30, when longer hours are sorely needed for most working parents.
Beyond the Bell and LA's BEST, along with other after-school
programs, need support to expand their activities to full-day
programs for off-track children.</LD>
<TE>   I urge the LAUSD to join with the mayor's office and private
corporations to provide badly needed funding to these programs. Most
of these children come from low-income families, as well as families
where both parents work full-time. We need to think creatively about
potential off-campus locations for programs that could provide kids
with stimulating activities. If we succeed in addressing this problem
now, in the end the whole community will benefit.</TE>

<HD>California Operations Put a Face on Minority Gains at DEA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michele Leonhart remembers when she was starting out as a federal
drug agent. Dope dealers weren't expecting women, and she
successfully played all kinds of undercover roles, from diplomat's
daughter to troubled young woman.</LD>
<LD>   Errol Chavez and Stephen Delgado remember bloody shootouts with
Mexican drug traffickers early in their careers. Chavez recalls a
time in Colombia when dealers killed six of his informants over two
years, tossing the severed tongue of one of them onto his backyard
patio.</LD>
<LD>   Now they are the three top federal drug agents in California,
running the main offices of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
in Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   That's a milestone. This is 2002, of course, and women, Latinos
and other minorities started making advances in business and
government long ago. But the DEA was a tougher nut to crack.</TE>
<TE>   Latinos in the DEA began to organize for better treatment in the
late 1970s, filed a class-action lawsuit against the agency in the
early 1980s and then waited almost a decade before seeing changes
they sought in promotions and work assignments.</TE>
<TE>   Women agents never faced quite the same battles, Leonhart says,
partly because they blended in on surveillance assignments and were
viewed as a valuable asset. But they were talking lawsuit, too, at
one point.</TE>
<TE>   To have high-profile offices led by people other than white males
"gives new perspective," said Leonhart, who leads the Los Angeles
office, third-largest in the nation with about 300 agents.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important to have two Latinos heading two of our most
important offices in a state where there is so much drug trafficking
from Mexico," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Of her own success, Leonhart said: "I know there's a difference
when I talk to mothers or to a classroom, and the questions turn to
what I did to make it. I see myself as a role model for women in law
enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   Leonhart became the first woman to head a DEA division office in
1997 when she was appointed chief in San Francisco. A year later she
took over in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Leonhart, 46, grew up in Minnesota, the oldest of seven children.
From early in elementary school, she wanted to be in law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   She graduated from college in 1978 with a degree in criminal
justice and began to discover that some doors were closed to her.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to enter law enforcement at a very interesting time
for women," Leonhart said. "The difficulties hit home when I applied
to St. Paul [police] and flunked the upper-body strength test. I was
a jock, and I couldn't imagine being more fit."</TE>
<TE>   Her next move was to send out 200 to 300 letters to police
departments around the country. Baltimore showed interest, did not
require an upper-body strength test and hired her.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't really say I was ever discriminated against, but the
attitude in Baltimore was always that I had to prove myself," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   After two years, Leonhart was assigned to assist some DEA raids in
Baltimore. And she loved it. In 1980, she graduated top in her DEA
class and was given her choice of assignments. She picked Minneapolis
"because I wanted to do something for the community where I was
raised."</TE>
<TE>   After five years in Minneapolis, Leonhart was assigned to be a
recruiter in St. Louis, then a group supervisor in San Diego, then to
a series of management jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never felt unappreciated," she said, although she knows it
was harder for women at the beginning of her career than it is now.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year the number of women agents in the DEA was up to 8%,"
she said. "That's one big change."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, who has run the San Diego DEA office since 1995, grew up
in New Mexico, the son of a state police official.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the DEA when it was still the Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs in 1971. Chavez says he had no idea what
discrimination was until the DEA assigned him to Denver in the early
1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "Hispanic agents were called on to help other agents with
translating, a lot of 'gofer' work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I started helping other agents at that point, and that's when I
started hearing cracks. On expenses, I was told to eat beans, that
Mexicans eat cheap."</TE>
<TE>   A tough street agent, Chavez was one of three DEA agents in a 1974
shootout with 20 Mexican marijuana traffickers outside Mazatlan. A
Mexican federal agent and seven drug dealers were killed and one DEA
agent was wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in 1981, Chavez served two years as agent in charge of
the DEA's office in Medellin, Colombia. It was his first management
job; he had one other agent to supervise, plus a network of
informants.</TE>
<TE>   As he moved up within the DEA, Chavez also became increasingly
involved in internal battles being fought by Latino agents.</TE>
<TE>   A past chairman of the DEA's Hispanic Advisory Committee, he has
also been active nationally in Latino law enforcement issues.</TE>
<TE>   "We've made tremendous strides," said Chavez, 53. "I think today
we have opened doors for younger agents to be treated fairly."</TE>
<TE>   There are now nine Latinos among the 49 senior managers in the
DEA. They head six of the agency's 21 U.S. field offices and two of
the four major foreign offices. About 100 others are in supervisory
positions.</TE>
<TE>   Though Latinos now account for 18.8% of the agency's top field
managers, Latinos make up only about 8% of the agency's force of
4,100 agents.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard recruiting these days," Chavez said, noting that many
major local police departments pay more to recruits.</TE>
<TE>   "In my area, Imperial County is an office that's really hard to
fill," he added. "It's hot and dirty.... In the last four years, I've
had five new agents quit after they drove there and got a look at
it.... One who stayed, his wife divorced him."</TE>
<TE>   Delgado, promoted in January to head the San Francisco office,
believes the DEA holds no one back because of race or gender.</TE>
<TE>   But he acknowledges that the year of the civil suit settlement
brought a career turning point for him. He had spent four years in
Madrid, serving as a DEA liaison with European police in fighting a
growing cocaine problem there.</TE>
<TE>   "The Colombians were using Spain as the gateway into Europe," said
Delgado, 53. "I loved the field work in Madrid, and I had two more
years that I could stay there.</TE>
<TE>   "But they wanted me back in 1991 to become a group supervisor in
our Fresno office," he added. "I'm not sure if it was related to the
lawsuit."</TE>
<TE>   Skin color and ethnic origin don't really matter on the streets,
Delgado added. White, black, Latino and Asian agents can all work the
same cases.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing drug dealers care about is money," he said. "All
you have to have is a good informant. And the only color you need in
the DEA is green."</TE>

<HD>Shortage of Blood Looms Over Hospitals</HD>
<DH>Health: Medical services may be reduced as donations fall
sharply since Sept. 11 rush.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RODNEY BOSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the days after Sept. 11, thousands of Ventura County
residents--desperate for some way to help in the wake of the
terrorist attacks--waited for hours to donate blood.</LD>
<LD>   Although many were turned away when local supplies reached
capacity, the wave of benevolence gave blood bank officials a respite
after two years of shortages.</LD>
<LD>   But the boom is over.</LD>
<TE>   This week, a little more than six months after the attacks, blood
bank officials are reporting a critical deficit in supplies that
threatens to disrupt medical services at area hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "Our refrigerator is empty," said Patty Hunt of United Blood
Services, the nonprofit blood provider servicing all nine hospitals
in Ventura County. "We are living hand to mouth."</TE>
<TE>   The blood bank tries to stock about 400 units of blood of varying
types at its Ventura office. But because of a dearth of donors
countywide, normal quantities to area hospitals are not being sent.</TE>
<TE>   If more donors don't step forward immediately, Hunt said,
hospitals will be forced to ration.</TE>
<TE>   "In another two or three weeks, there is not going to be enough
blood out there," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals would be forced to use supplies based on need, Hunt
said. For instance, elective surgeries might be postponed, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Remaining supplies would have to be used [only] for emergencies
and life-threatening situations until the supply could be
replenished," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Zia, blood bank supervisor and an associate lab director at
Los Robles Regional Medical Center, said conditions are the worst he
has seen in his 24 years at the Thousand Oaks facility.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is most concerned that a major trauma incident could
overwhelm the hospital's depleted stock.</TE>
<TE>   In such an emergency, "it is very possible patients that need
transfusions will not have the blood they require," he said. "It
could happen. That would be devastating."</TE>
<TE>   Acquiring blood from sources outside the county is not an option
because all blood banks are running low, Hunt said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hard to find another blood center that has enough
supply to support them and you," she said.</TE>
<TE>   To keep pace with demand, the blood bank needs to draw about 500
pints of blood each week. Donations are off by more than 100 pints a
week, Hunt said.</TE>
<TE>   Supplies began to dip in February because fewer residents were
making donations. The downward trend has worsened in March, leaving
blood bank officials scratching their heads about the cause, Hunt
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We just can't seem to pinpoint it," she said. "If we knew, maybe
there would be something we could do to fix it."</TE>
<TE>   While blood bank officials believe a lingering cold and flu season
might be partly to blame, they also look to Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Area donors turned out in droves after the terrorist attacks, but
because blood lasts only 42 days, the organization had to turn many
residents away. Now the organization is having a tough time
recruiting them back to donor sites.</TE>
<TE>   "It's possible that people are simply burned out on charity," Hunt
said. "There were so many different areas of need."</TE>
<TE>   For information on where to donate, call (800) 715-3699.</TE>

<HD>When, How 5 Were Killed Is a Mystery</HD>
<DH>Crime: Authorities thought one victim of an alleged
kidnapping- for-ransom ring was still alive almost a month after he
disappeared, his family says.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities believed at least one of four people allegedly kidnapped
by an Eastern European mob was still alive almost a month after his
abduction, his family said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Nick Kharabadze's weighted body was fished from the depths of a
Calaveras County reservoir in Northern California this week, along
with those of the other three victims of an alleged
kidnapping-for-ransom plot.</LD>
<LD>   The body of a fifth victim was pulled from the same lake in
October.</LD>
<TE>   Kharabadze and business partner George Safiev vanished Jan. 20,
six weeks after a bookkeeper for their fledgling film production
company, Rita Pekler, disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   But as late as Feb. 15, Kharabadze's relatives said, they were
given cause for hope.</TE>
<TE>   "I was told [by the FBI] that they identified all the kidnappers,
and next week it'd be wrapped up and Nick was going to come home,"
said Mat Shatz, Kharabadze's stepfather.</TE>
<TE>   FBI investigators say the victims were kidnapped by a crime ring
operating in the San Fernando Valley, with links to Russia and the
United Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. John Gordon in Los Angeles said the victims were held
for ransom and then killed, their bodies thrown from bridges into
remote New Melones Lake.</TE>
<TE>   The first body to surface was that of Myer Muscatel, a Sherman
Oaks real estate developer, found in October floating with his hands
bound and a bag over his head.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the bodies of Kharabadze, Safiev and Pekler were
recovered from the lake bottom, along with that of Alexander Umansky,
owner of a small North Hollywood electronics business.</TE>
<TE>   Six suspects are in federal custody and a seventh is being sought.
So far, none has been charged with murder. The kidnapping charges
pertain only to the abductions of Safiev and Umansky.</TE>
<TE>   "We're continuing the investigation," said Special Agent Matthew
McLaughlin, spokesman for the FBI's Los Angeles office. "We're doing
some things that are fairly sensitive right now."</TE>
<TE>   More charges may follow in the next two weeks, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have left many questions unanswered about the plot,
including where and how the victims were killed. The abductions
apparently took place over a three-month period ending in January.</TE>
<TE>   For the families of the missing--some of whom received phone calls
from their terrified loved ones saying they needed money fast--the
weeks that followed were a blur of fleeting hope and deepening dread.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Shapiro Muscatel, who married her longtime boyfriend just a
month before he disappeared in October, said authorities did not
inform her that they had made any arrests. The first inkling she had
of her husband's fate, she said, came March 11, when she was notified
that Muscatel's body had been identified after five months in a
Central Valley morgue.</TE>
<TE>   "The day after he disappeared, the [Los Angeles] police came to
see me," she said. "They said, 'Ma'am, we have seen many cases like
this. A lot of men have this midlife crisis.'</TE>
<TE>   "We could never really get them to believe it was something more
than that," she said. "In my estimation, they did not do enough."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Department declined to comment on her
accusation.</TE>
<TE>   Kharabadze's family did not go to police right away. For four days
after he vanished, the family got troubling phone calls from him,
saying he was in Las Vegas and would be home soon.</TE>
<TE>   In the last message left on an answering machine, Kharabadze
sounded desperate. He told his mother he loved her.</TE>
<TE>   It was then that the family contacted Los Angeles police and later
hired a private investigator as well.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI is still combing through the web of relationships among
the victims and their alleged abductors.</TE>
<TE>   It remains unclear, for example, whether Muscatel or Umansky had
any ties to the other victims or each other.</TE>
<TE>   Muscatel's wife said she did not recognize the names of any of the
other victims or the suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Olga Preiss, who worked for Safiev, said she knew of no links to
Muscatel or Umansky.</TE>
<TE>   Pekler's colleagues at her bookkeeping business said they knew of
no connections either.</TE>
<TE>   Also unknown is how the kidnappers picked their targets--although
one suspect, Petro "Peter" Krylov, 29, of West Hollywood, had worked
for Umansky before being fired last year.</TE>
<TE>   The others in federal custody are Iouri Mikhel, 36, of Sherman
Oaks; Jurijus Kadamovas, 35, of Encino; Ainar Altmanis; and two men
arrested in the United Arab Emirates--Andrei Agueev and Andrei
Liapine--who are charged with helping to transfer ransom money paid
for Umansky. All six suspects have pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Mikhel and Kadamovas own an upscale, by-appointment-only aquarium
store on Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Neighboring merchants described the pair as jet-setting
businessmen who tooled around in black luxury cars. But some kept
their distance from the shop, recalling an incident in which
"tough-looking Russian guys" shattered a storefront window.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Chernykh was working inside the store Friday, cleaning
fish tanks to help out Kadamovas' wife. He said he was Kadamovas'
business partner, creating elaborate saltwater aquariums with coral
sculptures, until Kadamovas dropped him three years ago to team up
with an investor.</TE>
<TE>   Chernykh said he was startled by his friend's arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a shock to me," he said.</TE>

<LD>The City Council agreed Friday to draft an ordinance that would ban
so-called head shops within 500 feet of schools.</LD>
<LD>   The council took action at the request of Fairfax High School
students and their parents, who were angered when they discovered a
store stocked with water pipes, drug-themed T-shirts and cigarettes
just yards away from the Melrose Avenue school.</LD>
<LD>   A final draft of the ordinance--which would bar similar shops from
operating near schools in the future--will be presented to city
lawmakers later this month.</LD>

<HD>Thousand Oaks Seeks to Block Cable TV Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY W. GRIGGS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fearing a monopoly of its cable service, Thousands Oaks hired a
private law firm and joined forces with Ventura County officials this
week to try to legally block Adelphia Communications Corp.'s recent
purchase of a rival cable system.</LD>
<LD>   A lawyer for Thousand Oaks said Adelphia's abrupt purchase of
Verizon's Americast system on Feb. 28 violated its franchise
agreement with the city, which requires 60 days notice and written
permission before a sale. A lawsuit against Adelphia is expected to
be filed Monday.. With a single cable operator, officials are
concerned about the potential for rate increases and diminished
service.</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia and Verizon maintain their deal did not violate their
contracts with either the city or county because the sale--valued at
a reported $58 million--involved everything except the franchise
agreements. Cable company representatives met with Thousand Oaks and
Ventura County officials earlier this week seeking a compromise, but
none was reached.</LD>
<TE>   "Adelphia and Verizon feel their legal position is justified ...
so there's no option but to go to court," said Mayor Ed Masry. "If
this deal is allowed to go through unchecked, then we've got a
monopoly in town."</TE>
<TE>   Lee Perron, Adelphia's regional vice president, said the company
has no plans to raise rates this year and wants to provide more than
45 new channels and other services to the company's 63,000 customers
on the older portion of the Adelphia system.</TE>
<TE>   Perron said the lawsuit by Thousand Oaks and the county is
regrettable.</TE>
<TE>   "More importantly, the company feels many of the customers in
Thousand Oaks would be disappointed to not have access to these
additional services," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The combined Adelphia-Verizon operation serves more than 112,000
Ventura County households. The company also provides cable service in
Oxnard, Camarillo and Port Hueneme, which have not yet joined the
legal action.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're trying to do is put Humpty Dumpty back together
again," said Bill Marticorena, an attorney with the Costa Mesa law
firm Rutan &amp; Tucker, which Thousand Oaks hired to challenge the
merged operation. "We want a competitive environment put back into
place until the court sorts out who's right."</TE>
<TE>   Since the transfer, Thousand Oaks has received complaints from
former Verizon subscribers about inaccurate bills, being forced to
change Internet addresses and a drop-off in customer service.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't like this monopoly thing," said Thousand Oaks resident
Grayce Hammond whose cable service went out last weekend. She and her
husband Joe were stood up by repairmen four times before the company
corrected the problem, she said.</TE>

<HD>Gay &amp; Lesbian Center, Hit by Budget Woes, Cuts 60 Jobs</HD>
<DH>Layoffs: Facility that serves thousands got into a costly
fight over competing AIDS rides.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leaders of the L.A. Gay &amp; Lesbian Center--caught in an escalating
controversy over competing AIDS fund-raiser bicycle rides--fired 60
employees Friday as part of a far-reaching reorganization.</LD>
<LD>   Operators of the 30-year-old Hollywood center said they face a
$4.5-million budget shortfall, caused primarily by costs and
confusion created by the launch of this May's San Francisco-to-Los
Angeles AIDS/LifeCycle bike ride.</LD>
<LD>   Among the victims of the reorganization was center Director Gwenn
A. Baldwin. She will step down after the AIDS ride.</LD>
<TE>   "We're devastated and sad," said Bonnie Osborn, a spokeswoman for
the center, which calls itself the world's largest gay organization.
She said the layoffs affect about 20% of the organization's staff.</TE>
<TE>   The cutbacks include elimination of the center's primary-care
medical program, which served about 2,300 people. "We're exploring
ways to help these patients get served," Osborn said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the center blamed a "combination of factors" for
their budget problems, including the recession and the effects of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But the biggest factor was the center's
decision last fall to sever its long-standing ties with California
AIDS Ride and create a rival fund-raiser, AIDS/LifeCycle.</TE>
<TE>   The center said that last year's California AIDS Ride, run by the
Los Angeles-based promotions company Pallotta Teamworks, suffered
unexpected cost overruns that cut into the event's profits.</TE>
<TE>   Center leaders joined with the San Francisco AIDS Foundation to
create AIDS/LifeCycle and announced its first ride would be held May
13-19. Pallotta, which had scheduled its ride for June 2-8,
unsuccessfully sued to block AIDS/LifeCycle.</TE>
<TE>   Osborn said the center spent $600,000 fighting the lawsuit. She
blamed negative publicity over the dispute for scaring off potential
AIDS/LifeCycle riders--who would have been expected to raise about
$3,800 each for the center and foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "We're $3.4 million below budget for AIDS/LifeCycle. We have a lot
of fixed costs for a first-year event. It's not going to make nearly
as much money as we anticipated," Osborn said.</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin, who said she is stepping down voluntarily, defended the
decision to start a rival bike-ride fund-raiser. She stressed that
the center intends to continue providing AIDS and HIV medical
services to about 2,000 patients. Officials at Pallotta Teamworks,
who are reportedly also struggling to recruit riders for their AIDS
ride, were unavailable for comment Friday. But others in the AIDS and
gay communities said they were not surprised by the cutbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I was flabbergasted by their decision to have two rides. That was
a recipe for disaster," said Michael Weinstein, head of AIDS
Healthcare Foundation, which assists AIDS patients.</TE>
<TE>   "They almost guaranteed themselves financial problems.... A mass
layoff is bad for any institution. For the premier gay and lesbian
organization in the country, it sends a message of weakness."</TE>
<TE>   But Gay &amp; Lesbian Center leaders defended the cuts as necessary to
maintain "a solid foundation" for the future. Its annual budget had
been $36 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The center leadership is making these changes so that important
programs will continue for our community now and in the future," said
Eric M. Shore, co-chairman of the group's board, in a statement.</TE>

<HD>Harman Says DDT Cleanup Is Finished</HD>
<DH>Safety: Contaminated soil in frontyards near where Montrose
Chemical operated decades ago has been properly removed, the
congresswoman says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Environmental Protection Agency properly removed DDT from
properties along a stretch of Kenwood Avenue in unincorporated Los
Angeles, according to an independent report released by Rep. Jane
Harman's office Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "Kenwood Avenue residents should feel reassured that soil with
high levels of DDT has been removed from their yards," said Harman, a
Venice Democrat whose district includes the Kenwood Avenue
neighborhood east of Torrance and south of Gardena.</LD>
<LD>   Some neighborhood residents raised concerns that the EPA's cleanup
was not complete because it did not include backyards, excluded the
street's east side and allowed low levels of DDT to remain.</LD>
<TE>   Homeowners on the west side of South Kenwood had wanted a
developer or the federal government to buy their homes instead of
having 25 front lawns "gutted out" by the EPA, but the level of
contamination did not meet the criteria for a buyout, officials said.
Residents relocated while the soil was being replaced last year.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental regulators said the DDT contamination came in
storm-water drainage from a chemical plant that once operated three
blocks away. The Montrose Chemical Co., a 13-acre plant that produced
about 1.6 billion pounds of DDT, operated in the area from 1947 to
1982. The DDT spread when a storm-water ditch was replaced in the
1960s and '70s with underground pipe drains, EPA officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The contamination caused the EPA to place the plant site and

<HD>Alonzo G. Decker Jr., 94; Engineer, Power Tool Innovator</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alonzo G. Decker Jr., the engineer who conceived and led a weekend
revolution with do-it-yourself power tools, has died. He was 94.</LD>
<LD>   Decker died Monday of heart failure at his home near Cecilton, Md.</LD>
<LD>   In his seven decades with Black &amp; Decker Corp.--the business
co-founded by his father in 1910--he was credited with driving a
movement that saw consumers spend their Saturdays doing chores around
the house with his drills, saws, hedge trimmers and DustBusters.</LD>
<TE>   His innovations within the industry spawned libraries of magazines
and boosted sales at hardware chains. His power drill was used to
take core samples of the moon's surface during an Apollo mission.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the outstanding chief executive officer in the company's
history," said Charles Costa, Black &amp; Decker vice president for
administration. "He took sales from $100 million to $650 million and
changed the way people do their work around the house."</TE>
<TE>   Decker, who stepped down as a Black &amp; Decker director a little
more than a year ago, was 14 when he began working for the
business--founded as Black &amp; Decker Manufacturing Co. by Alonzo G.
"Lon" Decker Sr. and S. Duncan Black.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Orangeville, Md., Decker was raised near Towson. He was a
graduate of Polytechnic Institute and earned a bachelor's degree in
electrical engineering from Cornell University in 1929.</TE>
<TE>   In 1930, he went to work for the company's export department and
demonstrated a rotary car polisher in the Soviet Union just as the
Depression was beginning to have an effect on business.</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of that year, he was summoned to his father's office
and told that he was going to be the first employee laid off. In
tough financial times, his father did not want to give the appearance
of nepotism.</TE>
<TE>   Decker then worked selling soap flakes to grocery stores for $8 a
week, and when he was hired back by the company, it was as a floor
sweeper for 25 cents an hour. He worked briefly in the sales
department before shifting to manufacturing in 1933.</TE>
<TE>   He was promoted to vice president in 1940, the same year he joined
the board, and was the chief executive officer from 1964 to 1975, and
chairman of the board until 1978. He resigned from the board Dec. 31,
2000.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1997 interview, Decker recalled that the Blacks were in sales
and marketing, while the Deckers were in engineering and invention.
"I don't know who planned that," he said, "but it worked."</TE>
<TE>   Decker liked to tell the story that he sensed a trend when World
War II defense workers would steal his industrial power drills. They
took the drills, then not available at hardware stores, to do home
improvements.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Decker and his engineering department brought out
the Home Utility Line--electric drills, drill bit sets, portable
circular saws, jig saws and sanders. In 1961, he introduced a
cordless, battery-powered drill--the first of a type widely sold
today.</TE>
<TE>   Decker was a believer in education and gave much of his personal
wealth to Maryland's colleges and universities.</TE>
<TE>   From 1973 to 1976, he chaired the Hopkins 100, Johns Hopkins
University's centennial giving campaign that raised $112 million to
endow 100 professorships. At the time, it was considered one of the
most successful drives of its type in the country.</TE>
<TE>   In his free time, Decker became an amateur botanist and grafted
limbs on sickly trees at his 600-acre estate on the Eastern Shore of
Chesapeake Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his wife of 53 years, the former Virginia Gent.</TE>

<HD>Deaths of Dolphins Investigated</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: A natural toxin may be responsible for poisoning
more than 20, scientists say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists performed necropsies Friday on three dolphins to determine
why more than 20 of the marine mammals have turned up dead on
Southern California beaches in recent weeks.</LD>
<LD>   A naturally occurring toxin may be poisoning them, said John
Heyning, curator of mammals at the Natural History Museum of Los
Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   Since late February, more than 22 dolphins with no signs of injury
or illness have turned up on Ventura, Los Angeles and Orange County
beaches, three of them on Friday morning. In a normal year, only one
or two dolphins wash up on local beaches during this time.</LD>
<TE>   "They look robust and healthy, except they're dead," Heyning said.</TE>
<TE>   All have been common dolphins, which are smaller than bottlenose
dolphins and do not usually swim along the shoreline.</TE>
<TE>   Tissue samples will be sent to labs around the country to
determine what has killed them. Results are expected next week.</TE>
<TE>   The stranding is the largest in Southern California since 1994,
when more than 70 dolphins washed ashore during a three-month period,
said Joe Cordaro, a wildlife biologist with the National Marine
Fisheries Service in Long Beach. The cause of those deaths was never
determined.</TE>
<TE>   This time, scientists suspect a potent toxin called domoic acid.
Although it has never been identified as being deadly to dolphins, it
has been blamed for the deaths of other marine mammals, including
humpback and blue whales. In 1998, it killed more than 400 sea lions
off the California coast.</TE>
<TE>   Domoic acid is produced by naturally occurring blooms of
single-celled organisms of the genus Pseudonitzschia.</TE>
<TE>   The toxin is concentrated in filter-feeding animals, such as
anchovies and sardines, which are in turn eaten by dolphins and other
mammals.</TE>
<TE>   "We're concerned, but we're not alarmed," Heyning said. The
overall population of common dolphins has remained stable.</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Health Services has issued a health
advisory, warning the public not to eat mussels, clams, scallops,
sardines, anchovies and crabs caught in the Monterey Bay region
because of elevated levels of domoic acid found in those creatures.</TE>
<TE>   The restrictions do not apply to commercially harvested fish,
shellfish or crab.</TE>

<HD>DWP Charged Excessive Fees, Atty. Gen. Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer filed a $60-million claim Friday against the
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, alleging that the
municipal utility has been overcharging state customers for years.</LD>
<LD>   In a filing with the city, Lockyer alleged that DWP used excessive
unauthorized special fees to deliberately inflate monthly electric
bills paid by state government entities located in the city, ranging
from the Ronald Reagan Office Building to Department of Motor
Vehicles offices.</LD>
<LD>   Frank Salas, DWP deputy general manager, said: "The department is
confident that its rates have been fair and reasonable. We will
reserve additional comments until we have seen the complaint."</LD>
<TE>   The claim said the fees were used for construction of power plants
and distribution facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "For more than a decade, DWP knowingly overcharged the state of
California in monthly electricity bills," Lockyer said. "We want the
utility to refund the money and pay penalties for taking unjust
advantage of government ratepayers."</TE>
<TE>   The claim, a required step before a lawsuit can be filed, seeks
treble damages for the alleged false billings. Spokeswoman Sandra
Michioku said the total would be $180 million.</TE>
<TE>   State law requires municipal utilities to have specific
legislative authorization to collect special assessments from
governmental customers, such as the state. But the attorney general's
office said DWP has been charging fees far in excess of those
authorized by law.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer's office is conducting an ongoing investigation into
alleged overcharges by private and public energy providers.</TE>
<TE>   During the energy crisis, DWP increased its generation and sold
excess power to help keep the lights on in California. Some consumer
groups and government officials have alleged that the utility took
excessive profits. The utility has said its profits were reasonable.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Lockyer filed a petition with federal energy
regulators seeking $1.8 billion to $2.8 billion--and perhaps
substantially more--in refunds from several energy companies.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Lockyer sued four companies for $150 million, alleging
that they broke contracts to provide emergency power to the state's
power grid operator and sold the electricity on the lucrative spot
market.</TE>
<TE>   The state is asking regulators to void or modify $43 billion in
long-term power contracts.</TE>

<HD>Boot Camp Latest Idea for El Toro</HD>
<DH>Military: Congressman's plan to move training facility from
San Diego is at least the third base reuse bid since voters ruled out
an airport.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Suddenly, it seems, everyone wants a piece of El Toro. Even the
Marines.</LD>
<LD>   The latest proposal, by Rep. Randy "Duke" Cunningham
(R-Escondido), calls for moving the Marines' West Coast boot camp
from San Diego to a portion of the former El Toro Marine base. That,
in turn, would allow San Diego's airport, Lindbergh Field, to expand
onto the depot property.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for Marine headquarters in Virginia declined to
comment Friday on the proposal to move what is officially called the
Marine Corps Recruit Depot, an idea that Cunningham's office said was
developed in recent weeks during meetings with Marine Corps
Commandant Gen. James Jones.</LD>
<TE>   "As a matter of policy, we prefer not to comment on private
conversations the commandant has with government officials," Maj.
Matthew McLaughlin said. "We are aware of the initiative led by
Congressman Cunningham and will continue to look at all options
available."</TE>
<TE>   On March 5, Orange County voters rezoned the 4,700-acre El Toro
base for a park, nature preserve and low-density
development--grounding eight years of planning by Orange County for a
commercial airport that eventually was to become the second largest
in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham's bid for a slice of El Toro is at least the third to
emerge since the election, when Navy officials declared that, without
an airport at the base, they intend to sell the bulk of the property
to developers. A final decision is expected April 23.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista) suggested trading a chunk of base land
to a residential developer in exchange for building badly needed
housing at Camp Pendleton in north San Diego County. As many as 2,000
military families are on a waiting list for housing there.</TE>
<TE>   Two Orange County supervisors asked Navy officials last week to
consider giving 300 acres of El Toro to Cal State Fullerton for a
South County campus. Several investors also toured the area,
including a group that for at least three years has eyed land on the
base for a pro football stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The vacuum created by the loss of a future airport--and the lack
of a plan to replace it--triggered the last-minute scrambling, said
Jeffrey Finkle, executive director of the National Assn. of
Installation Developers in Washington, which specializes in the reuse
of military bases.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that there appears to be a crack in the facade of the
process, everybody wants a piece of the pie," Finkle said. "If [local
officials] don't reemerge as a strong advocate for the future
condition of this property, they'll get willy-nilly [development]."</TE>
<TE>   "We call it the great El Toro land grab," said Gary Simon,
executive director of Orange County's El Toro planning office.
Planners are working on options for the base, which they'll deliver
April 16 to the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said his office has been deluged with calls from people
pitching development proposals, and had to cut off base tours because
of the demand. "Every Tom, Dick and Harry wants a piece of the base,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Moving the Marine Corps back to El Toro would mean reactivating a
portion of the base, which closed in July 1999 along with its sister
base in Tustin. Navy Lt. Comdr. Pauline Storum said Friday from
Washington that she knew of no other base in the country that was
closed and then reopened.</TE>
<TE>   During an Orange County appearance last month, Vice President Dick
Cheney was asked about bringing the Marines back to El Toro and
dismissed the notion. "We need to be careful that we don't spend
money on bases that might not be needed," he said during a luncheon
at the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace in Yorba Linda.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), whose district includes El
Toro, said Friday that he was aware of discussions about moving the
Marines' West Coast boot camp to El Toro but called the prospects
"highly unlikely."</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the Navy's intention to sell base acreage, Cox said,
"The Pentagon now has a plan for El Toro and it's my understanding
that this is not part of it."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Rep. Susan A. Davis (D-San Diego), whose district
includes Lindbergh Field and the boot camp, said she hadn't been
contacted by the Marines.</TE>
<TE>   Moving the boot camp was embraced by Cunningham as a way to give
the Marines more training space and allow expansion of San Diego's
cramped airport. At 550 acres, Lindbergh is about the size of Orange
County's John Wayne Airport but handles twice as many
passengers--15.2 million last year compared with about 7.5 million at
John Wayne.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham's proposal would give the Marines up to 1,000 acres at
El Toro, triple the size of the 388-acre San Diego boot camp, which
the Marines have operated since 1923. It handles about 21,000
recruits during each 13-week training session. The Marines' only
other U.S. boot camp is at Parris Island, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham said San Diego and its port authority could help
finance the estimated $500-million construction cost for a new
training facility at El Toro by paying for the boot camp property.</TE>
<TE>   Finkle, of the base development association, said his fear is that
the Bush administration will decide, based on El Toro's example, to
sell closed bases rather than let local agencies hash out what should
be built on them. The Defense Authorization Act of 2002 changed
regulations to require that if land isn't provided for public
purposes, it must be sold for cash to bolster the defense budget.</TE>
<TE>   "Land is not as valuable in other places in the country [and] a
lot of communities might not roll over and let the Department of
Defense do whatever they want," Finkle said.</TE>

<LD>A 12-year-old boy who sparked a San Clemente brush fire that

he set the fire on Aug. 1, tossed burning matches into dry brush at
the bottom of Trafalgar Canyon near the San Clemente Pier.
Prosecutors said the boy wanted to see what a large fire looked like
but did not intend to set fire to the entire canyon, causing more
than $4 million in damage.</LD>
<LD>   They said the short stay in custody is intended to "scare" the boy
straight but that a more serious punishment isn't warranted because
the fire was essentially an accident.</LD>
<TE>   "We wanted him to feel what it was like in jail, to hear those
doors closing behind him," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Joe Williams.
''Hopefully, it's an experience that will make him think."</TE>
<TE>   Deputies escorted the boy to a holding cell immediately after the
Friday morning court hearing. He was set free less than an hour
later, according to his attorney, John Barnett. Prosecutors said any
portion of a day in juvenile hall fulfilled the judge's sentence.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also ordered the youth, whose name was not released, to
perform 200 hours of community service, undergo counseling and remain
on probation for as long as nine years, until his 21st birthday.</TE>
<TE>   The county's probation department will determine in the next two
months how much the boy and his parents will be asked to pay in
restitution. It is unlikely the sum will near the value of the damage
because the boy doesn't have the money. However, the boy's parents
may be subject to civil court demands for damages.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said it was difficult to craft the punishment for the
boy given the circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   When the boy realized the fire was getting too large, he tried to
stomp it out, prosecutors said. When that failed, he ran to tell
nearby lifeguards. "It's a tragedy that people lost an entire life's
worth of memories and valuables for a stupid thing," said Williams.
"It was just a 12-year-old kid playing with fire who didn't intend
for it to get out of control."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides agreed the punishment was appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel a common correct solution was reached and an appropriate
conclusion was reached," Barnett said. "He's a young boy and he was
appropriately impressed by the magnitude of the situation."</TE>

<HD>Anaheim Aides to List Fund Sources</HD>
<DH>Politics: City Council requires more staff to tell of
financial interests. An employee had advised a campaigning trustee.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Anaheim City Council is requiring some of its aides to file full
economic-interest disclosures after a resident complained about some
political work done by a city worker.</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous vote Tuesday came eight months after resident Duane
Roberts raised questions during a council meeting about a $1,000
payment received by a mayor's assistant in late 2000 from Don Garcia,
now a trustee on the Anaheim City School District board.</LD>
<LD>   The aide, James Peterson, was working in Mayor Tom Daly's office
when he received consulting fees from Garcia, who was then running
for the board seat.</LD>
<TE>   Peterson, now a field representative for U.S. Sen. Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.), said he was paid to draft Garcia's campaign
strategy, but Roberts alleges that the aide put himself in a position
of conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Before the payment was made, Garcia had been one of several
community leaders lobbying the City Council to deny a liquor license
to a gas station near some properties owned by Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   The opponents of Ultramar Gas Station on Harbor Boulevard said the
area already had too many liquor stores, which contribute to crime,
they claimed. Ultramar ultimately received its license.</TE>
<TE>   The way Roberts sees it, Peterson would have more reason to lobby
against the liquor license if he also were going to be paid by
Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   However, Garcia did not get his way on the liquor license and
Peterson said he was not hired by Garcia until after that vote was
made. "Even though what Mr. Peterson did might not have been illegal,
was it ethical?" Roberts asked after the council's vote last week.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson said he did not lobby Daly on behalf of Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia did not return repeated calls requesting comment, but the
mayor said he was aware of his former aide's work for Garcia and that
he found nothing improper.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea that [someone] can buy influence from me by hiring my
part-time aide is ridiculous," Daly said.</TE>
<TE>   Daly and other city officials said the disclosure rules were
changed to include the council aides because the ordinance is
periodically revised and not because they found anything illegal in
Peterson's work for Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, they said, Roberts' complaint led the city to look at
council-aide positions more closely.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson said he did not disclose the money because he was not
required under the previous ordinance. "I think [the new ordinance]
is a great idea and much overdue," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have happily complied if it was required because I did
nothing wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Under the new ordinance, aides who advise council members on
policy issues will be required to file detailed economic-interest
statements along with department heads and several other employees.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia's payment to Peterson came to light when Garcia filed his
campaign records during the education board's election in November
2000. Garcia had no opponents and was automatically granted a seat.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Garcia took his board position, Roberts filed a
complaint with the Orange County district attorney's office, alleging
Garcia did not live in the district but rather, in a house he owns in
Corona del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office said Friday that it is still
investigating that case.</TE>

<DH>Recognition: Tarzana deli owner is honored by LAPD for
keeping a promise to look after a deceased friend's elderly mother.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Crystal Plimbley is fulfilling a promise she made to a friend's
daughter.</LD>
<LD>   When Plimbley was a waitress at a Tarzana deli 15 years ago, she
met Trudy Klearman and her daughter, Florence Stanton, who was a
pioneer Los Angeles policewoman in the 1950s. Stanton took her mother
to the deli every day and the two women developed a close friendship
with Plimbley.</LD>
<LD>   About eight years ago, Plimbley said, Stanton asked her, "If
anything should happen to me, would you take care of my mother?"
Plimbley agreed.</LD>
<TE>   Three years later, Stanton, then 71 and living with Alzheimer's
disease, fell out of bed, broke her neck and died.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since, Plimbley has been looking after Klearman, now 95, who
lives in an apartment near the deli.</TE>
<TE>   For taking on the role of guardian, Plimbley was honored this week
by the Los Angeles Police Department's West Valley Division. Capt.
James Cansler and Sgt. Martin Fentress presented her with a plaque
and a certificate at the deli where it all began.</TE>
<TE>   Plimbley, who now owns the deli, gives Klearman her medication
daily and takes her on errands.</TE>
<TE>   Klearman spends seven days a week, from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., at the
cozy restaurant--which regulars liken to TV's ''Cheers'' bar, where
everyone knows your name.</TE>
<TE>   ''She's everything to me,'' Klearman said, gently rubbing
Plimbley's knee. ''She takes very good care of me. I would be lost
without her.''</TE>
<TE>   Plimbley, 64, sees her role as a natural one. She swears to know
1,001 people by name and has watched babies grow up in her 25 years
at the deli.</TE>
<TE>   ''I'm kind of a mother hen, I take care of everybody,'' Plimbley
said. ''Everybody eventually comes to Crystal's Deli.''</TE>
<TE>   Klearman's daughter was one of the first female officers in the
LAPD, at a time when women weren't allowed to drive patrol cars,
Fentress said, adding that one of Stanton's most memorable cases was
catching a downtown rapist.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura Boulevard deli is a popular spot with West Valley
officers, who are familiar with Klearman's bright smile, lively eyes
and lined face. ''If you saw her, you'd never think she's 95 years
old,'' Fentress said. ''She still does her hair and makeup, which I
think is so cute.''</TE>
<TE>   Police decided to honor Plimbley to thank her for taking care of
an extended member of the LAPD family, Fentress said.</TE>
<TE>   The honor came as a surprise to Plimbley and especially to
Klearman, whom many consider extremely shy.</TE>
<TE>   ''I have nothing else to say, honey,'' Klearman told a reporter.
''I don't like all of this attention.''</TE>

<LD>A woman who police think may have had gang ties died after being shot
twice in the head at close range in a Westminster neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   Xuan Trung Thi Li, 27, was shot Wednesday night at Aspenwood
Avenue and Dogwood Street, police said. She died at UC Irvine Medical
Center in Orange.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators said Li had recently moved to San Diego from
Westminster and had been dating a suspected gang member.</LD>
<TE>   "One of the officers here was able to identify her through that
affiliation," said Westminster Police Lt. Mike Schliskey. "We don't
believe she was involved in a gang herself. We don't know if this is
some kind of retaliation or not."</TE>
<TE>   Li's identity was confirmed with a fingerprint match. Schliskey
said the fact that her prints were on file does not mean she had an
arrest record. People in a wide range of occupations are required to
register their fingerprints, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Police are searching for Li's boyfriend, as well as any possible
witnesses to the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, we have little to go on," Schliskey said. "Most people in
the neighborhood heard what they thought were gunshots or
firecrackers but did not investigate."</TE>
<TE>   A driver saw Li on the side of the road and called 911.</TE>

<HD>County May Sue to Delay Sale of Homes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SANTA ROSA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Sonoma County has threatened to sue Japanese landlord Gensiro
Kawamoto after negotiations over repairs at homes he owns and rents
here collapsed.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, which would parallel legal action by a tenants group,
would hold up the sale of as many as 149 homes while demanding that
repairs be made.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Dani Jo Handell said Thursday she decided to
move ahead with the suit after tenants received letters asking them
to give up their right to sue in exchange for free rent. Handell sent
investigators to the subdivisions Tuesday to collect the letters.</LD>
<TE>   "This is just the most egregious ethical violation I've ever
seen," Handell said. "Here you are, you believe there are some
good-faith negotiations. Then they go behind your back and they go to
the subdivision in a limo to hand these letters out. They were
basically giving Sonoma County the finger."</TE>
<TE>   Handell said laws forbid attorneys from distributing information
known to be misleading. Tenants, she said, cannot waive all of their
rights to sue.</TE>
<TE>   Kawamoto went unnoticed for more than 10 years in Santa Rosa
before he decided last month to sell all 149 homes and gave tenants
30 days to move. He did the same with 420 homes near Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   After sparking outrage, he offered the tenants another 90 days to
move and said he was seeking an investor to buy the homes and rent
them back to the tenants.</TE>

<HD>Paul L. Kennedy, 61; Dance Teacher</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Respected Los Angeles-based pop dance choreographer and teacher Paul
Lawrence Kennedy has died. He was 61.</LD>
<LD>   One of the owners of the Kennedy Tap Company and Universal Dance
Design, a dance studio, he died March 16 of heart failure.</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy was born in Boston in 1940, and learned dancing from his
mother. By age 12, he was teaching others in her Boston dance
academy, and the love of teaching stayed with him all his life.</LD>
<TE>   In the 1960s and '70s, Kennedy arranged dances for bands and
singing groups, touring with Gladys Knight and the Pips.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to Los Angeles in the late '70s and began working with a
roster of major Motown artists, including the Temptations and Marvin
Gaye.</TE>
<TE>   He choreographed moves to the songs from Gaye's album "From Here,
My Dear" for performances in 1979. He also worked with Michael
Jackson on tap dancing.</TE>
<TE>   After working with his sister Arlene in a Compton children's
project, Kennedy increasingly devoted himself to teaching children.</TE>
<TE>   He and Arlene opened Universal Dance Theatre (later Universal
Dance Design) in Inglewood in 1982, and although he eventually moved
his studio across town to the Fairfax area, his students followed.</TE>
<TE>   He also continued to work in the commercial dance world,
choreographing an episode of the TV series "A Different World" in
1993.</TE>
<TE>   During his career, Kennedy received a number of awards from the
dance community, but in 1998 he received special recognition when
legendary Cuban ballerina Alicia Alonso invited the Kennedy Tap
Company to dance in Havana at the 50th anniversary celebration of
National Ballet of Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   That honor meant a lot to Kennedy, but he always spoke of dance
training in terms of a life experience and the values it brought to
his students.</TE>
<TE>   "They come here as children and stay until college," Kennedy told
The Times. "No pregnancies, no drugs, and all the madness they miss."</TE>

<HD>Judge Orders Kerkorian to Pay $250,000</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MGM mogul Kirk Kerkorian was ordered Friday to pay $250,000 to cover
his former wife's legal fees arising from their court battle over
child support.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Lee Smalley Edmon ruled that the money, half
the amount former tennis pro Lisa Bonder Kerkorian had sought, is "an
interim award" that will "help defray the costs of litigation."</LD>
<LD>   At a hearing Thursday, Bonder Kerkorian's lawyer estimated her
legal costs at $327,000 and anticipated additional fees of $200,000.
Bonder Kerkorian has paid $179,000, attorney Steven A. Kolodny told
the judge.</LD>
<TE>   Bonder Kerkorian, 37, who was married to the casino and film
studio magnate for a month in 1999, is the mother of 4-year-old Kira
Kerkorian. Although Kirk Kerkorian, 84, acknowledged paternity and
accepted financial responsibility for the child during previous legal
proceedings, attorneys now agree that he is not Kira's biological
father.</TE>
<TE>   California law gives the judge discretion to order Kerkorian to
pay for his former wife's legal fees because of the disparity in
their incomes. He is worth an estimated $6.5 billion, compared with
her estimated worth of $12.6 million.</TE>

<HD>Kodak Theatre Sued Over Access for Disabled</HD>
<DH>Courts: The new venue for the Academy Awards is accused of
having inadequate seating for people in wheelchairs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal lawsuit filed Friday against the Kodak Theatre by a group
that advocates for the disabled says the opulent 3,500-seat venue for
this weekend's Academy Awards lacks proper design for people in
wheelchairs.</LD>
<LD>   Brought by the Western Law Center for Disability Rights on behalf
of Elizabeth Bancroft, the suit says the theater's floor plan has
inadequate wheelchair-accessible seating, in violation of the federal
Americans With Disabilities Act and California law.</LD>
<LD>   "It's shocking that it is so bad," said Eve Hill, director of the
nonprofit group.</LD>
<TE>   She said theater officials who took her on a tour of the facility
two weeks ago "couldn't show me a single seat that complied with the
law."</TE>
<TE>   Hill said the suit was not filed to capitalize on publicity
surrounding the Academy Awards. "The timing is coincidental--we
weren't holding it," she said. She did acknowledge, however, that "it
is a good opportunity to educate the public and builders that this is
an important issue."</TE>
<TE>   According to the complaint, Bancroft, who is paralyzed below the
waist, attended a Melissa Etheridge concert in December and was
seated in a cramped, sloped area with poor sight lines, despite her
request for a wheelchair-accessible seat.</TE>
<TE>   Bancroft said her view was continually obstructed by other
concertgoers standing in front of the two seats she and a friend had
purchased.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really frustrating," Bancroft said. "I paid the same
amount as everyone else in [the] orchestra [section]."</TE>
<TE>   The theater, tucked inside the Hollywood &amp; Highland entertainment
complex, opened in November. Owned by Canada-based TrizecHahn Corp.
and operated by Anschutz Entertainment Group, the theater was
designed by architect David Rockwell.</TE>
<TE>   A TrizecHahn official said the firm had not seen the lawsuit and
would not comment until it did.</TE>
<TE>   Bancroft said she remembers watching last year's Academy Awards
and seeing a nominee who used a wheelchair seated in the rear of the
Shrine Auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept thinking how great it was that they were moving to a new
theater," she said. "It's a new theater, but nothing has changed."</TE>

<HD>Carl McIntire, 95; Firebrand Radio Evangelist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Rev. Carl McIntire, a firebrand fundamentalist radio evangelist
who railed against communism, liberalism, racial integration, sex
education, evolution and water fluoridation from his broadcast pulpit
for four decades, has died. He was 95.</LD>
<LD>   McIntire died of natural causes Tuesday in Voorhees, N.J.</LD>
<LD>   From 1938 to 1998, he served as pastor of Collingswood Bible
Presbyterian Church in Collingswood, N.J.; and from 1948 until his
death, he was president of the International Council of Christian
Churches, a group of fundamentalist denominations.</LD>
<TE>   During the peak of his popularity in the 1960s, McIntire's daily
half-hour "20th Century Reformation Hour" radio program was carried
on more than 600 stations in the United States and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   McIntire's belief that every word of the Bible was inspired by God
and his ultraconservative political views earned him a loyal radio
following.</TE>
<TE>   But McIntire, who called himself "the servant of the Lord in a
very holy cause," had a flair for making his views heard off the air
as well.</TE>
<TE>   Vocal Opponent of 'Pingpong Diplomacy'</TE>
<TE>   In 1971, he led 14,000 mostly middle-aged demonstrators down
Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, demanding U.S. victory in Vietnam
and promising "we are going to keep this country from falling to the
Communists."</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of so-called "pingpong diplomacy," in which an
American table-tennis team visited China and a Chinese team visited
the U.S. in 1971, McIntire played a game of table tennis in front of
the White House to protest what he called Nixon's appeasement of
Communist China.</TE>
<TE>   McIntire also picketed meetings of religious groups, including the
World Council of Churches, where he protested appearances by
religious leaders from behind the Iron Curtain who he said were KGB
agents.</TE>
<TE>   A tall man with wavy gray hair who was once described as having
"the polished grace of a successful businessman," McIntire wasn't
bashful about criticizing fellow clergymen.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, he called evangelist Oral Roberts a "fraud and a fake"
after Roberts declared that he had seen a vision of a 900-foot Jesus
supporting Roberts' controversial multimillion-dollar hospital
complex in Tulsa, Okla.</TE>
<TE>   "No decent Christian" believes Jesus is 900 feet tall, McIntire
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1960s, McIntire faced criticism of his own when his
radio broadcasts got him into trouble with the Federal Communications
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, major civic and religious groups were complaining
that the station on which McIntire broadcast his program served as an
outlet for what one clergyman called "highly racist, anti-Semitic,
anti-Negro, anti-Roman Catholic" sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   McIntire broadcast his program live from WXUR in Media, Pa., a
station owned by Philadelphia's Faith Theological Seminary, where
McIntire served as president.</TE>
<TE>   Battled FCC Over 'Fairness Doctrine'</TE>
<TE>   In 1970, the FCC determined that the station had consistently
violated the "fairness doctrine," which requires a station to provide
radio time to people who have been attacked on the air.</TE>
<TE>   After McIntire waged a two-year legal battle, the FCC revoked the
station's license. Within two months, more than 200 stations dropped
his program.</TE>
<TE>   Marianna Clark, McIntire's daughter, said Friday that her father
"never criticized anyone else's theological or political opinions
without offering them [a chance] to come on his station and reply,
but no one would come on to discuss it or debate with him."</TE>
<TE>   As she sees it, "the liberal groups that were opposing his
conservative views ganged up and went to the FCC and said this radio
station is not abiding by the fairness doctrine. It was a devastating
thing that the FCC did in taking away this man's religious freedom
and his freedom of speech."</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, McIntire attempted to broadcast from a pirate radio
station on a former Navy mine sweeper off the New Jersey coast, but
the Coast Guard put a quick stop to it.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of McIntire's radio audience took a heavy toll.</TE>
<TE>   Contributions from his radio audience--reportedly an estimated
$3.9 million a year in small contributions in 1971--dried up, and
McIntire was no longer able to support his ministries. The Christian
Beacon Press, for which McIntire served as editor, went bankrupt, and
its various holdings were lost. They included the property that
housed Shelton College, a Christian liberal arts institution in Cape
May, N.J.; and hotels in Cape May and Cape Canaveral, Fla., which
served as Bible conference centers and vacation lodging for
McIntire's followers.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate bankruptcy, the land in Philadelphia that housed
Faith Theological Seminary also was lost, McIntire's daughter said.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a Presbyterian minister, McIntire was born in
Ypsilanti, Mich., in 1906. When he was 7, he moved to Oklahoma, where
his mother's parents had been missionaries to the Choctaw Indians.</TE>
<TE>   McIntire earned his undergraduate degree at Park College in
Parkville, Mo., studied at Princeton Theological Seminary and earned
his divinity degree at Westminster Seminary in 1931.</TE>
<TE>   McIntire was ordained in the Presbyterian Church. But after he
criticized the church's missionaries as liberal, an ecclesiastical
court in 1935 found him guilty of "sowing dissension within the
church," and his ministerial credentials were withdrawn.</TE>
<TE>   In 1938, McIntire helped form the Bible Presbyterian denomination
in Collingswood.</TE>
<TE>   He stopped preaching at his church in 1998. But he continued to
broadcast his "Reformation Hour," which by the early 1990s aired on
only two stations. It continues to air once a week in Camden, N.J.,
and five days a week in Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   McIntire made his last live broadcast a few months ago, and
programs featuring taped sermons he made at his church are still
airing. Clark expects the broadcasts to continue and, she said, her
father's sermons are on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Clark, McIntire is survived by his second wife,
Alice; daughter, Celeste Bashaw of Pennington, N.J.; son, Thomas, of
Toronto; 13 grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren.</TE>

<LD>   Santa Monica sued seven major oil companies and 11 other firms in
2000 for tainting much of its drinking water with MTBE, a probable
carcinogen that is added to gasoline to make it burn cleaner.</LD>
<LD>   In a recent series of motions, Shell Oil Co., Arco and others have
argued that the statute of limitations ran out because the
contamination was discovered in 1995.</LD>
<TE>   In dismissing the motions, Superior Court Judge Stephen J.
Sundvold wrote, "MTBE is alleged to still be leaking into the water
system. The statute of limitations has not run with respect to these
acts."</TE>
<TE>   He also is allowing the city to seek triple punitive damages under
a civil code that allows water utilities to seek such compensation if
its water is tampered with.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of punitive damages has not yet been determined, said
Joe Lawrence, assistant city attorney. "For the people of Santa
Monica, [the decision] means they're going to be made whole and
eventually the water is going to be cleaned up," Lawrence said.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to reach officials at the oil companies Friday were
unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, was first added to gasoline
more than two decades ago to reduce air pollution, and its use became
widespread in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Further study found that MTBE is a suspected carcinogen that
spreads quickly through the soil and ground water, and that even in
small amounts it can make drinking water smell like turpentine.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, MTBE contamination shut down seven of Santa Monica's 11
drinking-water wells. The city and the oil companies tried to reach
an agreement, but it fell through in January 2000. The city sued five
months later.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the companies are paying the city $3.5 million a
year to import water in compensation for the lost wells.</TE>

<HD>MTBE Lawsuit Can Go Forward</HD>
<DH>Environment: Judge sides with Santa Monica, which claims
its water was tainted by additive.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County judge dismissed on Friday several oil companies'
attempts to kill a landmark MTBE lawsuit that could result in
liability for more than $200 million in cleanup costs.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Monica sued seven major oil companies and 11 other firms in
2000 for tainting much of its drinking water with MTBE, a probable
carcinogen that is added to gasoline to make it burn cleaner.</LD>
<LD>   In a recent series of motions, Shell Oil Co., Arco and others have
argued that the statute of limitations ran out because the
contamination was discovered in 1995.</LD>
<TE>   In dismissing the motions, Superior Court Judge Stephen J.
Sundvold wrote, "MTBE is alleged to still be leaking into the water
system. The statute of limitations has not run with respect to these
acts."</TE>
<TE>   He also is allowing the city to seek triple punitive damages under
a civil code that allows water utilities to seek such compensation if
its water is tampered with.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of punitive damages has not yet been determined, said
Joe Lawrence, assistant city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "For the people of Santa Monica, [the decision] means they're
going to be made whole and eventually the water is going to be
cleaned up," Lawrence said.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to reach officials at the oil companies Friday were
unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, was first added to gasoline
more than two decades ago to reduce air pollution, and its use became
widespread in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Further study found that MTBE is a suspected carcinogen that
spreads quickly through the soil and ground water, and that even in
small amounts it can make drinking water smell like turpentine.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, MTBE contamination shut down seven of Santa Monica's 11
drinking-water wells. The city and the oil companies tried to reach
an agreement, but it fell through in January 2000. The city sued five
months later.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the companies are paying the city $3.5 million a
year to import water in compensation for the lost wells. More than
$75 million has been spent on cleanup and litigation, and the final
number will probably top $200 million, according to the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica's is among the most high-profile cases of MTBE
contamination in the country. Cleanup nationwide is expected to cost
at least $29 billion, according to a study commissioned by Santa
Monica and several other cities.</TE>
<TE>   Sundvold's ruling comes on the heels of Gov. Gray Davis'
announcement that he is delaying the phaseout of MTBE for a year. He
has said the delay will allow a more orderly transition to another
additive--ethanol--and protect California drivers from gas shortages
and price spikes.</TE>

<HD>3 'Deli Divas' Will Sparkle for the Oscars, Both on the Job
and Partying After</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeweler Martin Katz calls them the "deli divas" of Beverly Hills. The
three waitresses at Nate 'n' Al's will model several million dollars'
worth of jewelry Sunday--during and after work.</LD>
<LD>   The donning of diamonds is happening because Kaye Coleman, Arlene
Malmberg and Gloria Leon were photographed for Vanity Fair's
"Hollywood!" issue.</LD>
<LD>   "They told me they had been invited to Vanity Fair's [Oscars]
party,'' related Katz, a regular at the deli. "And I said, 'Then you
need to be jeweled.'"</LD>
<TE>   Katz, who decks out numerous stars for the Oscars, will dress up
the three women for the party. And they'll give a preview at work
earlier in the day.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll still get cream cheese on my uniform," Coleman said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he expected to get better service from the wise-cracking
waitresses now, Katz replied: "If I did, I'd be really disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, in her 37th year at Nate's, was asked if she feared that
wearing a million dollars' worth of jewelry while waiting on tables
would result in smaller tips. "No," she said, "I wouldn't allow
that."</TE>
<TE>   Salute to Oscars (cont.): Reaching into the Only archives, I
conclude this series with these Hollywood items (see photos):</TE>
<TE>   * A marquee prophesying that May won't be such a merry month
(snapped by Bingham Cherrie).</TE>
<TE>   * A marquee that tells a sad love story (by Peter Schartz).</TE>
<TE>   * A freeway sign composed by someone who evidently wasn't familiar
with the name (by Tom LaBonge).</TE>
<TE>   * And, finally, because I got lost trying to get close to the
heavily guarded HOLLYWOOD sign, my snapshot of another world-famous
civic landmark.</TE>
<TE>   Got a light? Gardena police, dispatched to a burglarized market,
found a suspect nearby who matched the description given by a
witness. Suspicions were increased by the suspect's possessions--$74
in cash, a 12-pack of beer and some cigarettes. Forty-three packs of
cigarettes, actually.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: You never know when you're going to make a discovery
in L.A. Flo Selfman and the Independent Writers of Southern
California were visiting the L.A. Police Academy when they noticed a
tiny chapel with 13 seats and two stained-glass windows.</TE>
<TE>   "We spotted bags of earplugs hanging on a wall hook inside,'' she
said. Why the earplugs? "The chapel,'' she added, "happens to
overlook the academy's shooting range.''</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rabbi Israel Miller, 83, who worked to obtain compensation from
Germany for Holocaust survivors, died Thursday at his home in
Jerusalem.</LD>
<LD>   The Conference on Jewish Material Claims against Germany, which he
had led since 1982, gave no cause of death.</LD>
<LD>   "Under Rabbi Miller's leadership, the Claims Conference negotiated
numerous compensation and restitution agreements enabling more than
400,000 Jewish Holocaust survivors in over 60 countries to receive
compensation payments of approximately $2 billion," the organization
said.</LD>
<TE>   He also helped with the recovery of unclaimed Jewish property in
the former East Germany.</TE>
<TE>   The sale of that property provided about $500 million that the
Claims Conference used for humanitarian, research and educational
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Baltimore, Miller earned degrees at Yeshiva College and
Columbia University and served as a chaplain in the Army Air Corps
during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   He served as rabbi at the Kingsbridge Heights Jewish Center in the
Bronx from 1941 to 1968. He also served as an administrator at
Yeshiva University.</TE>
<TE>   He was national chairman of the American Jewish Council on Soviet
Jewry in the 1970s.</TE>

<LD>Robert Horn, 85, a longtime political science professor at Stanford
University and a noted expert in constitutional law, died March 5 of
natural causes at his home in Palo Alto.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Greenville, Ohio, Horn earned a bachelor's degree in
history from Ohio Wesleyan University and master's and doctoral
degrees in political science from Princeton. During World War II and
the Korean War, he worked in the U.S. Army's psychological warfare

<LD>   He taught at Harvard, the University of Chicago and Sophia
University in Japan before joining the Stanford faculty in 1953. He
retired in 1979.</LD>
<TE>   Horn left a scholarly legacy through his teaching and influenced a
number of students who went on to important legal or political
careers, among them Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.).</TE>
<TE>   "His course was so fascinating; it taught how we Americans
organize a society," Baucus said. "He changed my life. I would not

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rand Holmes, 60, an underground cartoonist during the psychedelic era
of the 1960s and early '70s, died Friday in Nanaimo hospital in
British Columbia, Canada. The cause was complications from
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Truro, Nova Scotia, Holmes grew up in Edmonton and started
drawing cartoons as a teenager. He moved to Vancouver at age 27.</LD>
<LD>   His strip, Harold Hedd, was the Canadian answer to such U.S.
underground favorites as Gilbert Shelton's Fabulous Furry Freak
Brothers and Robert Crumb's Mr. Natural.</LD>
<TE>   Harold Hedd, featuring the misadventures of a bespectacled
marijuana smoker hassled by Constable Leroy, first appeared in the
weekly Georgia Straight.</TE>
<TE>   Holmes published three Harold Hedd collections in the early 1970s
and did the cover for "History of Underground Comics," published by
Rolling Stone magazine's book wing, Straight Arrow.</TE>
<TE>   He also contributed to the All Canadian Beaver Comix, White Lunch

<LD>An 11-year-old girl critically injured after being buried alive in a
20-foot-deep sand pit last week is now home.</LD>
<LD>   Hospital officials released Miranda Hernandez on Tuesday, but her
lawyer said she appears to have suffered a brain injury from the
incident.</LD>
<LD>   "She's slow," said Amy Cruz, Miranda's mother. "Everything is slow
to her right now. She talks really slow, she reaches slowly. I'm very
thankful that she's alive."</LD>
<TE>   Sisters Andrea Cavazos, 12, and Alyssa Ortiz, 9, were killed March
13 after they tried to retrieve a basketball in the pit used as fill
for a nearby cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Charles Hawkins said he plans to file a claim against the
Public Cemeteries District.</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The official charge was illegal dumping. It might as well have been
terrible timing.</LD>
<LD>   Mario Leon, 21, pleaded guilty in Superior Court to dumping a pile
of wood remnants at the city-owned Fiesta Island on Mission Bay. On
Friday, he was fined $250.</LD>
<LD>   According to court papers, Leon picked the worst time to do his
dumping: just as city officials were holding a news conference a
dozen yards away to announce a crackdown on illegal dumping.</LD>
<TE>   City Atty. Casey Gwinn and Councilwoman Donna Frye followed Leon's
truck and Gwinn made a citizen's arrest.</TE>
<TE>   A permit to dump the wood in a city landfill would have cost $10,
officials noted.</TE>

<HD>Gunfire Kills Two on Santa Ana Street</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two young motorists died Friday after their car was sprayed by
gunfire at a busy Santa Ana intersection in an apparent gang slaying,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   The men, both in their early 20s according to police, were
traveling north on South Flower Street near Edinger Avenue about 3
p.m. when a second vehicle overtook them and its occupants fired
several bullets into the cab of their Honda Civic, witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   "I heard a pop! pop! pop! and I looked out the window," said Scott
Choi, owner of Choi Auto Service at that intersection. "I saw this
black car just speed off and the other car just rolled slowly through
the intersection and came to a stop."</LD>
<TE>   The driver of the Honda died at the scene. The passenger died two
hours later at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. Their identities
were not released. Two suspects were in custody and being
interviewed, police said. They gave no other details. "It's being
investigated by the gang unit because of the appearance of the whole
thing," said Mario Corona, of the Santa Ana Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   The victims' car rolled to a stop in front of a row of
single-story houses. All but one of its windows were shattered by
bullets. As police cordoned off sections of South Flower Street,
interviewed witnesses and collected bullet casings, the driver of the
car remained slumped in the front seat, covered by a yellow plastic
tarp.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so sad," Choi said. "He's just a kid, maybe 20, and he's
sitting there dead. It's just so sad."</TE>

<HD>Couple Who Ran Brothel Next to School Are Given 5 Years
Probation</HD>
<DH>Courts: They and their firm are ordered to pay $59,400 in
back taxes.</DH>

<LD>The owners of a Pomona massage parlor that served as a house of
prostitution were sentenced to five years' probation Friday in
addition to having to turn over their property to an elementary
school.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Terry A. Green also ordered that
Herschel H. Jennings, 65, wear an electronic monitoring device for
one year in lieu of serving a year in County Jail. He will be
restricted to his home in San Bernardino County during that period
except for such limited activities as visiting the doctor and grocery
shopping. Green ordered him to begin his sentence May 21.</LD>
<LD>   His wife, Kay, 64, was ordered to perform 1,000 hours of community
service.</LD>
<TE>   The couple and their business, Wiljay Corp., were ordered to pay
$59,400 in back taxes to the State Franchise Tax Board. They will not
be allowed to operate any sex-related businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The massage parlor, Swedish Salon, had operated since 1971 on
Garey Avenue next to Abraham Lincoln Elementary School. Parents often
complained that children found discarded lewd material that had blown
against a chain-link fence.</TE>
<TE>   The sentencing Friday was in accordance with a plea bargain in
which the couple agreed to enter pleas on four tax and
prostitution-related charges in exchange for dismissal of 18 other
counts. Herschel Jennings pleaded guilty to a felony charge of
conspiring to run a house of prostitution and two misdemeanor charges
of operating the business. He pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor
charge of filing false corporate tax returns.</TE>
<TE>   His wife pleaded no contest to the same four charges.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Gail Ehrlich said the four convictions had
exposed the couple to possible sentences of six years in prison plus
one year in County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement requires them to give the Swedish Salon site to the
Pomona Unified School District. The district will demolish the
property's three buildings and use the land for portable classrooms
or a playground for Lincoln Elementary, spokesman Bill Stelzner said
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The land transfer process, which started shortly after the couple
agreed to the plea arrangement in January, was expected to be
completed Friday, Ehrlich said.</TE>
<TE>   The couple are also being required to close down Pomona Valley
Health spa on North Orange Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Kay Jennings' lawyer, Richard J. Beada, said in an interview that
the settlement was fair. But he argued that the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office should focus on more serious crimes
instead of prosecuting the Jenningses.</TE>
<TE>   "There is so much real crime going on out there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ehrlich countered that the Swedish Salon "has been an ongoing
concern" for 30 years. "The criminal element was being attracted to
it, and children could be harmed by its presence," she said.</TE>

<HD>Wrestling With the Origins of the Torah</HD>
<DH>Bible: Days before Passover, Southland Jewish leaders from
Orthodox to Reconstructionist gather to debate the roots of their
faith.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A year after Rabbi David Wolpe of Sinai Temple in Los Angeles ignited
an international furor by publicly questioning the biblical story of
the Exodus, Jews are still arguing.</LD>
<LD>   This week, five rabbis from each of Judaism's four major movements
came together for the first time in Los Angeles to debate the
timeless question of who wrote the Torah, the first five books of the
Bible that include Exodus. The rabbis agreed: No one knows.</LD>
<LD>   After that, however, they did what rabbis do famously well. They
questioned and questioned, argued and argued over everything from
whether God or people wrote the sacred Scripture, whether all of it
is historically true and why any of this even matters.</LD>
<TE>   Rabbi Steven Carr Reuben, a Reconstructionist Jew and president of
the Board of Rabbis of Southern California, quoted one of his
confirmation students as saying the question of who wrote the Torah
is less important than why it was written. But many of the other
rabbis--who were asked to base their discussion on the book "Who
Wrote the Bible?"--disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "The question of revelation, of who wrote the Torah and what
happened at Sinai, is the core issue for the Jewish people," said
Conservative Rabbi Mark Diamond, executive vice president of the
rabbinical board, which sponsored the event. "Depending on your
answer, it has to inform your Jewish beliefs and practices."</TE>
<TE>   Reform Rabbi Steven Z. Leder of Wilshire Boulevard Temple in Los
Angeles told the 350 people gathered Wednesday at Valley Beth Shalom
in Encino that he could not be a believing Jew if he thought that God
had literally dictated the Torah. He said the Scripture contains too
many exhortations he rejects: that people suffer because they sin,
that homosexuals and rebellious children should be stoned, that
slavery and concubinage are permissible.</TE>
<TE>   "If you attribute all of this to God as opposed to human beings, I
would feel shackled to a theology that I would reject," Leder said.
He made a distinction between the Torah's supposed facts, some of
which he doubts, and its truth, all of which he said he embraces.</TE>
<TE>   Leder's remarks drew a sharp dissent from Orthodox Rabbi Elazar
Muskin of Young Israel of Century City.</TE>
<TE>   Muskin said traditionalists believe that God did dictate the Torah
to Moses; but they also believe God handed down an oral tradition
that eventually became the Talmud to help believers make sense of the
written law.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Torah's literal passages may exhort the stoning of a
"rebellious son," he said, the oral tradition as compiled in the
Talmud says the practice "never was and never will be." The
Deuteronomy passages are meant to teach parenting responsibility and
how to avoid raising such a child, Muskin said.</TE>
<TE>   "The traditionalist position is not one of blind faith," he said.
But he added that if he did not believe the Torah was divinely
authored, there would be no reason for him to observe its laws.</TE>
<TE>   Although Jews have debated the Torah's origins for 1,500 years,
questions of its historicity exploded last Passover, when Wolpe told
his congregants that most modern archeologists agreed that the Exodus
did not occur precisely as described in the Bible. The bombshell
sermon reverberated around the world, prompting more than 1,000
e-mails, letters and calls to Wolpe.</TE>
<TE>   The impact of that single sermon lingers today. Among other
things, Diamond said it opened the door for more rabbis to discuss
the issue of the Bible's historicity with their congregants. Although
most non-Orthodox rabbis are trained not to view the Bible as literal
truth, Diamond said, they did not often present this to their
congregants--mainly because, in his words, such sermons were often
"duds."</TE>
<TE>   "People don't generally come to synagogue to hear rabbis pick
apart sacred Scripture," he said. "They want to be inspired."</TE>
<TE>   Conservative Rabbi Mimi Wiesel of the University of Judaism said
some of her rabbinical students get upset by her textual analysis,
complaining that she is taking God out of the Torah. "What is this
that makes us afraid?" she asked the crowd. "What would be missing if
we said this book is indeed a compilation of humans?"</TE>
<TE>   That is a question that Wolpe himself says he intends to pursue.
The rabbi did not attend the Torah discussion but said in an
interview that he remains "unrepentant" about his views.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in the inexhaustible spiritual richness of these
stories and the God who inspired them," said Wolpe, who is
Conservative. "But the insistence on their factuality is, at this
point in history, just untenable."</TE>
<TE>   The rabbi, who is just completing a yearlong Bible study on the
issues raised by his sermon last year, said he intends to explore,
possibly in a book, why the debate touched such raw nerves in
people's spiritual psyches.</TE>
<TE>   "Something very deep and important was touched on in the whole
debate," he said. "It's the belief that if the historical claims of
their faith aren't entirely factual, the spiritual claims of their
faith cannot be true. That's what I was arguing against."</TE>
<TE>   He added that he won't be preaching on the Exodus this Passover,
which starts Wednesday evening. Instead, he'll be pleading for major
humanitarian aid for Israel and the mounting toll of victims of the
current Mideast violence.</TE>
<TE>   At the Torah event, which was sponsored by KOCHAV, a rabbinical
board initiative that promotes trans-denominational programming, the
Exodus was not discussed either. Instead, both the rabbis and the
small-group discussions focused on the biblical flood story.</TE>
<TE>   At one table, six Conservative members of Temple Aliyah in
Woodland Hills, one Reform Jew and two unaffiliated Jews agreed that
the story seemed to have at least two authors. Among other things,
noted Debby and Norman Frank of Tarzana, one part of the story said
God asked for one pair of each creature and another part said seven
pairs were called for.</TE>
<TE>   Leder told the crowd that even his 9-year-old daughter, Hannah,
knew that God didn't actually get all those animals on a boat. When
she first asked about it, he says, he told her that even if the facts
of the story weren't true, its truth was: the need to assume
responsibility for all creatures on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   In remarks after the panel, Muskin said anyone who understands
Hebrew would see that the story bears no inconsistencies. The single
pair of animals came to the ark, according to the Hebrew, but the
seven pairs were taken.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, he said, Noah took seven pairs and allowed the others
to come of their own accord. Somehow, everyone managed to squeeze
into the ark.</TE>
<TE>   "Miracles happen," the bearded and bespectacled rabbi said,
shrugging.</TE>
<TE>   It is safe to say they will keep arguing.</TE>

<HD>Avraham Tory, 92; Diary Told of Nazi Brutality in Lithuania</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After German troops rolled into the central Lithuania city of Kovno
in June 1941, 30,000 of the city's 37,000 Jews who hadn't escaped or
been killed were herded into a ghetto. For the next three years, Nazi
edicts ruled their lives--and their deaths.</LD>
<LD>   "From now on, the Germans declare that any pregnant woman will be
killed on the spot," read one edict.</LD>
<LD>   "Jews must pull all wagons themselves, including funeral hearses,"
read another.</LD>
<TE>   "The mother and sister of the hanged Meck [an escapee] must be
taken to the Ninth Fort for execution," read yet another.</TE>
<TE>   By war's end, all but about 3,000 of Kovno's Jews had perished,
many in mass executions. But a record of their lives--and
deaths--survived to tell their story.</TE>
<TE>   Avraham Tory, a Jewish lawyer who risked his own life by keeping a
detailed diary and gathering official Nazi documents that bore
witness to what happened to the doomed inhabitants of the Kovno
ghetto, died of natural causes Feb. 24 at his home in Tel Aviv. He
was 92.</TE>
<TE>   As deputy secretary of the Jewish Council of Elders, which
administered the Germans' rules in the ghetto, Tory was able to
record the German decrees and regulations, council deliberations and
conversations with Nazi officials in his diary.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day, I put into writing what my eyes had seen and my ears
had heard, and what I had experienced personally," Tory later wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Working with other council members, he collected Nazi documents,
orders, warnings, notices and commands that documented what he wrote
in his diary, as well as gathering clandestine photographs and
artist's drawings made by ghetto inhabitants who witnessed Nazi
atrocities.</TE>
<TE>   Tory buried all of the documentation in five wooden crates beneath
a ghetto apartment house, inserting into each box a note, written in
Yiddish:</TE>
<TE>   "With awe and reverence I am hiding in this crate what I have
written, noted and collected with thrill and anxiety, so that it may
serve as material evidence--'corpus delecti'--accusing testimony when
the Day of Judgment comes."</TE>
<TE>   In case none of Kovno's Jews survived the war, Tory instructed a
Lithuanian priest to dig up the crates and forward them to the World
Zionist Organization.</TE>
<TE>   Couple Escaped Into Countryside</TE>
<TE>   Tory, along with his fiance, managed to escape the ghetto to a
hiding place in the countryside in the spring of 1944. They returned
to Kovno after Soviet troops occupied the city in August. Tory later
smuggled out his diary and the most important documents, which he had
buried in a rucksack.</TE>
<TE>   His diary, which is among the most comprehensive surviving
official Holocaust diaries, was later used in war-crime deportation
hearings against the mayor of Kovno and the SS ergeant who personally
directed the mass murder of 9,200 Kovno Jewish men, women and
children in what was called the Great Action.</TE>
<TE>   "He wrote the diary because he wanted to leave evidence so that
the world would know what the Germans did," Tory's wife, Pnina, said
by phone from Tel Aviv on Tuesday. "He was a very brave man."</TE>
<TE>   She was equally brave, keeping the latest pages of Tory's diary in
her room and sometimes writing down what he dictated to her.</TE>
<TE>   The Torys, who were married in August 1944 after the liberation of
Kovno, had planned to flee Lithuania together. But when Tory received
word in February 1945 that he was going to be sent to Siberia, he was
forced to immediately leave alone.</TE>
<TE>   His wife and her young daughter from a previous marriage left
about three weeks later and joined him in Poland.</TE>
<TE>   After arriving In Israel in 1947, Tory practiced law and became
secretary general of the International Assn. of Jewish Lawyers and
Jurors.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, his diary was published in Hebrew. Two years later, it
was published in English as "Surviving the Holocaust: The Kovno
Ghetto Diary."</TE>
<TE>   "It is a painful document," a Chicago Tribune reviewer wrote, "its
pages a collage of retold events, scraps of news, official German
directives, firsthand testimonies, whiffs of rumor and terror."</TE>
<TE>   In one passage of the diary, Tory writes of the morning roll call
on Oct. 28, 1941, by Nazi SS Master Sgt. Helmut Rauca, in which he
condemned to death entire families with a simple wave or a nod.</TE>
<TE>   "From time to time," Tory wrote, "[he] feasted on a
sandwich--wrapped in wax paper lest his bloodstained hands get
greasy--or enjoyed a cigarette."</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, more than 9,000 Jewish men, women and children
were gunned down at the edge of a deep pit.</TE>
<TE>   "In every house a void had been created," Tory wrote. "The homes,
the furniture, and the belongings of the victims ... seemed to exude
the odor of death. Hardly anyone dared touch them or make use of
them."</TE>
<TE>   Emotions Delayed Diary's Publishing</TE>
<TE>   Pnina Tory said it took so long for her husband's diary to be
published "because when we got to Israel, it was like fire for him to
touch it. He didn't speak about the Holocaust because it was so
emotional. He couldn't get over it for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Tory's diary formed the basis for "Hidden History of the Kovno
Ghetto," an exhibition at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in
Washington from 1997 to 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "This community of individuals was essentially destroyed by the
Germans," said museum Director Sara Bloomfield. "But the effort Tory
led and what he did through his diary created a legacy for that
community that no longer existed."</TE>
<TE>   Bloomfield said people in other Jewish ghettos had tried to
document things. But Tory's writing "is certainly important because
it is so meticulous. He was a lawyer, so there was precision of
language, as if he were preparing evidence for a trial."</TE>
<TE>   Tory's diary also inspired a documentary, "Kovno Ghetto: A Buried
History." The original diary pages are housed at Yad Vashem in
Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Tory was born Avraham Golub in Lazdijai, Lithuania in 1909. After
high school, he came to America to study law at the University of
Pittsburgh, but returned to Lithuania after his father's death and
continued studying law at the University of Kovno. He competed as a
gymnast in the first Maccabi Games in Tel Aviv in 1932. As a young
attorney, he was active in Zionist politics there.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Tory is survived by three daughters who
also live in Israel, Shulamit Karbi, Alina Tory and Tzila Magdassi;
six grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An April 8 preliminary hearing date has been set for murder suspect
Vincent Sanchez in the slaying of Moorpark College student Megan
Barroso last July.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez, a 31-year-old Simi Valley handyman, was charged Friday in
Ventura County Superior Court with murder, attempted rape, kidnapping
and related allegations that allow prosecutors to seek the death
penalty. At an arraignment Friday, Sanchez pleaded not guilty to
those counts, as well as to charges that he assaulted several other
women during the past four years.</LD>
<LD>   A grand jury indicted Sanchez on those charges in September, but
the indictment was set aside this month by a Santa Barbara judge who
found there were not enough women on the grand jury. Ventura County

<HD>Therapist Gets 90 Years in Sex Case</HD>
<DH>Sentencing: Chatsworth man forced girl, 14, in his care to
have sex with him and his then-wife.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Chatsworth family therapist who specialized in treating minors was
sentenced Friday to 90 years in state prison after pleading guilty to
multiple counts of having unlawful sex with a 14-year-old girl he was
counseling.</LD>
<LD>   Allen Eldredge, 57, admitted using his position as a licensed
therapist to coerce the Fillmore girl into sexual acts with him and
his then-wife.</LD>
<LD>   Eldredge pleaded guilty in November to 29 counts of forcible sex
and one count of conspiracy.</LD>
<TE>   His former wife, Judy Eldredge, 46, pleaded guilty to aiding and
abetting a rape as well as two counts of having unlawful sex with a
minor. She was sentenced last month to six years in state prison.</TE>
<TE>   The couple were arrested at their Chatsworth home on Nov. 25,
2000, after the girl, then 19, reported the incidents to Ventura
County sheriff's deputies.</TE>
<TE>   A search turned up videotapes of the sexual assaults as well as
journals in which Allen Eldredge had documented numerous encounters
with the girl, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   The sexual abuse started in 1994, when Eldredge began to counsel
her, and continued through 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Wendy Macfarlane, who prosecuted the case, said
Eldredge was not paid for the therapy sessions because he was a
friend of the girl's family.</TE>
<TE>   Eldredge manipulated the girl into having sex after gradually
gaining her trust, the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   "Because he was a therapist, whatever he told her had a lot more
credibility," Macfarlane said. "It was very much like an
incestuous-molestation type of thing."</TE>
<TE>   Eldredge initially denied the charges. But he changed his plea to
guilty two days into his trial in Ventura County Superior Court after
jurors heard excerpts from his journals.</TE>
<TE>   Eldredge faced up to 240 years in state prison--eight years for
each of the 30 criminal counts. Macfarlane argued for that sentence
based on the plotting that went into molesting the girl.</TE>
<TE>   "He planned out everything," she said, "and his pursuit of her was
relentless."</TE>
<TE>   But Judge Roland Purnell handed down a minimum 90-year sentence,
or three years for each count served consecutively, in part because
Eldredge spared the girl from testifying, Macfarlane said.</TE>
<TE>   Eldredge probably will die in prison, since he must serve 72 years
before he is eligible for parole.</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks attorney Michael Zimbert, who represented Eldredge,
could not be reached for comment late Friday.</TE>

<HD>Arafat's Intent, Influence Being Called Into Question</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Israel says he wields enough control. But others may have
more sway over militants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>The unending debate over Yasser Arafat turns on the questions of
his willingness and ability to halt the gun and bomb attacks by
Palestinians that so terrorize Israeli civilians.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a position drastically weakened in recent months, the
Palestinian Authority president retains enormous influence and often
calls the shots. But he is also battling internal power struggles that
shape his course of action.</LD>
<LD>   In blaming Arafat for a suicide bombing Thursday, the second in two
days, the Israeli government accused him of "exclusive responsibility"
for yet another attack in a wave of violence that has killed about 115
Jews in the first 80 days of the year. The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a
militia linked to Arafat's Fatah movement, claimed responsibility for the
deadly blast.</LD>
<TE>   In the Israeli view, a news report that the assailant was a former
police officer who had been in Palestinian Authority custody just last
week, and that Palestinian officials were aware he had terrorism on the
mind, bolsters the case of Arafat's complicity.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli government and military intelligence officials don't allege
that Arafat specifically ordered the bombing. Instead, they say, he
creates and feeds a climate in which such actions are encouraged. He
instigates and gives a green light. He has failed to expressly prohibit
attacks, except when, as in a televised Arabic-language statement
Thursday night, he comes under enormous U.S. pressure to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "Arafat never gives his people instructions," a senior Israeli
intelligence official said. "He says everything in four languages, [but]
his people understand exactly what he means and what he wants to do."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians counter that it is Israel's heavy-handed military
actions, raids and economic and physical blockades more than Arafat's
statements in praise of martyrdom, or anything else he has said, that
swell the ranks of suicide bombers and snipers.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks, they say, come from rage and revenge.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen this amount of people ready to die" for the
Palestinian cause, Arafat advisor Marwan Kanafani said Friday. "It is
becoming extremely difficult for the authority to convince people to lay
down their weapons, cool down their activities and stop resisting while
Israel continues its aggression. They feel like all the obligations are
on the Palestinians' shoulders, and that is more surrender than
cease-fire."</TE>
<TE>   Judging Arafat's role and responsibility has become more complicated
in the last year and a half of vicious fighting. About 1,500 people have
died, about three-quarters of them Palestinians. Palestinian militias
have grown more powerful, and their leaders have gained in stature, to
the point where some are mentioned as potential rivals or successors to
Arafat, who is 72.</TE>
<TE>Top Lieutenant Contradicts Arafat</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday night, even as Arafat went on Palestinian television to
condemn the bombing in Jerusalem and call for an end to such attacks, his
top lieutenant was doing the opposite.</TE>
<TE>   Marwan Barghouti, a stout, fiery militant and the most popular leader
of Fatah in the West Bank, spoke to the far more widely viewed Al Jazeera
television network. He justified Thursday's suicide bombing as a
"response against Israeli massacres" and blasted U.S. diplomatic moves in
the region, which he said were "doomed to failure."</TE>
<TE>   "We are confident that our people and our fighters will find the short
path to the end of the Israeli occupation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Barghouti, who has periodically defied Arafat, today ranks as,
arguably, the most influential Palestinian in the West Bank. Israeli
officials accuse Barghouti of having played a role in dozens of Israeli
deaths.</TE>
<TE>   As Barghouti's profile has risen, so has that of the Al Aqsa Martyrs
Brigade. The underground militia has taken the lead in the war that
Palestinians are waging against Israeli occupation and has staged some of
the most brazen attacks yet. The Bush administration has added the
militia's name to its list of terrorist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The brigade is made up of numerous cells formed and operating locally
in Palestinian towns and refugee camps across the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. All offer nominal allegiance, though not total obedience, to
Arafat and the Fatah leadership. But they appear to share little
operational coordination, and cells carry out bombings and ambushes with
a fair amount of autonomy.</TE>
<TE>   How much control does Arafat have over Al Aqsa?</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the Bush administration is declaring Al Aqsa a terrorist
organization while continuing to deal with Arafat suggests that the
Americans do not believe that the Palestinian leader has a direct
command-and-control relationship with the militia.</TE>
<TE>   "You can certainly connect the dots from the Al Aqsa brigades to
Arafat, but it's not the same thing as saying the brigades are mainstream
Fatah," a Western official said. Declaring Al Aqsa a terrorist
organization "can be seen as a warning to Arafat, but not an ipso facto
condemnation."</TE>
<TE>   Even among Israeli officials, there is disagreement over the extent of
Arafat's control over the militia. Intelligence officials suggest that
Arafat's authority is often subsumed to that of Barghouti and Fatah
militias. Arafat, whom Israel had confined to his Ramallah headquarters
for months, has lost touch with the reality of the larger West Bank and
Gaza Strip, these analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   But Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon disagrees: Barghouti and the
militias would obey Arafat's orders to stop attacking Israelis, Sharon
says, if only Arafat would say the word, and mean it.</TE>
<TE>   The militias "are part of Arafat's flesh and blood," said Sharon's
spokesman, Raanan Gissin. "Arafat wants to wave two flags: one, the
banner of terror to pressure Israel for concessions, because he thinks
negotiating under fire is the best way to gain results, and two, the flag
of negotiations and peace to try to mend fences with the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the emerging Al Aqsa leaders cut their teeth on the first
intifada, when Palestinians rose up against Israeli military occupation
from 1987 to 1993; many were hardened in Israeli jails, and some are
little more than common criminals who now have an armed following.</TE>
<TE>   It is not yet clear whether these fighters will submit to any
cease-fire that Arafat declares. On Friday, one of the commanders, Naser
Oweis, vowed to continue "our armed resistance . . . on the path of
martyrdom." And they will certainly resist being disarmed, a requirement
of the CIA-drafted truce plan that the Palestinians and Israelis are
negotiating.</TE>
<TE>Security Forces Left Dispirited</TE>
<TE>   Col. Jibril Rajoub, the head of security for the West Bank and one of
Arafat's principal enforcers, told a Palestinian newspaper this week that
the Al Aqsa fighters were embarked on a "noble" cause. He said he
wouldn't try to disarm them.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it is not at all certain that the Palestinian security forces
have the resources or wherewithal to enforce anything. Israel has
repeatedly bombarded police stations, jails and outposts and killed
dozens of police officers, leaving Arafat's security forces as angry and
dispirited as most other Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   As Israel continues to question whether Arafat really has any interest
in a cease-fire--a question that Palestinians also ask about
Sharon--Arafat is pointedly not speaking out against attacks on Israeli
soldiers and Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   What Arafat is demanding--in his television appearance Thursday, and
again in a meeting overnight with leaders of various Palestinian
factions--is a halt to attacks on Israeli civilians inside Israel.</TE>
<TE>   And on that singular point, Arafat couldn't gain complete agreement in
the meeting with faction leaders, according to two participants.
Throughout the reportedly stormy session, as Arafat argued that
Palestinian national interests would be best served by stopping attacks,
one man remained notably silent: Barghouti.</TE>

<HD>Radical School Reform</HD>
<DH>Pakistan seeks to stamp out extremist training grounds by revamping
the curriculum of madrasas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PESHAWAR, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Mohammed Adil is 11 years old, can't subtract and can write only
seven letters of the English alphabet. But he can recite lengthy verses
of the Koran in carefully memorized Arabic.</LD>
<LD>   Syed Gul is the same age. He can add, subtract and multiply simple
numbers and scrawl out all the letters of the English alphabet. But he
flubs verses from the Islamic holy book.</LD>
<LD>   The difference between the two Pakistani boys is as simple as it is
deceptive: Mohammed attends a religious seminary, or madrasa, and Syed a
government-run public school in this frontier city near the Khyber Pass.</LD>
<TE>   The assumption that Mohammed is destined to embrace the reactionary
Islamic views of neighboring Afghanistan's Taliban movement while Syed
will become a free-thinking democrat is virtually an axiom of the
grass-roots war on terrorism in Pakistan and much of the Muslim world.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is far more nuanced. Both boys share greater-than-even odds
of entering adulthood functionally illiterate and without the skills to
compete in a 21st century global economy, according to UNICEF figures.
For girls, the odds are worse.</TE>
<TE>   In Pakistan's rush to win its way back into the West's good graces,
President Pervez Musharraf announced a plan to drain the breeding ground
for Muslim extremists by reforming radical madrasas that have sent their
graduates off on jihads outside Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   In the process, the campaign is unearthing a shameful truth: Pakistan
can make atomic bombs but cannot educate its 68 million children, many of
whom abandon the poor nation's underfunded public schools and flock to
the room, board and faith offered by fundamentalist schools, most of
which are funded by foreign philanthropies.</TE>
<TE>   "What skills?" asked Abdullah Khan, principal of the Akhunabad public
elementary school that Syed attends here in Peshawar. "Their parents
don't care about their academic life. They only want them to be able to
read and write just a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Down a narrow unpaved street, below a faded Coca-Cola sign, a blind
mullah shrugs at the same question as he squats with his young charges on
a collage of threadbare prayer mats. "I can't afford to teach them
computers or modern subjects," said Qari Katchkul Ahmad, who drills the
Koran into 50 boys and 180 girls who recite, eat and sleep at his cold
and dimly lighted madrasa.</TE>
<TE>   Like many other mullahs here, Ahmad says he instills in his students
not politics but the strict tenets of brotherly love that are central to
Islam.</TE>
<TE>   But Musharraf, and many of his Western allies, is suspicious of such
mosque-based schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Mosques are being misused for propagating and inciting hatred against
each other's sect and beliefs and against the government too," Musharraf
warned in a speech in January. "Do we want Pakistan to become a
theocratic state? Do we believe that religious education alone is enough
for governance, or do we want Pakistan to emerge as a progressive and
dynamic Islamic welfare state? The verdict of the masses is in favor of a
progressive Islamic state."</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf gave Pakistan's madrasas, also known as madaris, an
end-of-March deadline to register with the federal government and a
year-end deadline to begin teaching math, science, the English language
and Pakistani studies, if they don't already do so. No penalty was
mentioned for failing to meet the goals, though he already has ordered
the demolition of a dozen illegally constructed mosques and madrasas in
Islamabad, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Now that bureaucrats closer to the minefields of Pakistan's Muslim
identity are implementing Musharraf's rules, they appear to be
substantially softening the policy.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no coercive element to it," insisted S. M. Zaman, chairman
of the Pakistan Madaris Education Board, the federal entity that
certifies and regulates religious schools. "The existing madaris don't
have to get involved."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, madrasas have turned out top scholars throughout the
Muslim world, and their alumni in Pakistan have become government
ministers and businesspeople. A 12-year course of study at some of the
better madrasas in this nation renders a certificate that carries as much
cachet in the academic and working worlds as a master's degree in Arabic
or Islamic studies.</TE>
<TE>   But many of these schools have forsaken what once was a broad course
of study for a reactionary curriculum penned in the 19th century, known
as Deobandism.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the students who leave these institutions react to the
secularism of the modern world in draconian ways, Zaman said.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone buys into the theory that madrasas are the cradle of
extremism. Osama bin Laden comes from a wealthy Saudi family and studied
economics and management at a Saudi university. Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh,
accused of masterminding the kidnapping and slaying of Wall Street
Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, was raised in a London suburb and schooled
in Britain's finest private institutions, including the London School of
Economics.</TE>
<TE>   "Islamic radicalism, fundamentalism and revivalism is a middle-class
intelligentsia phenomenon," Tariq Rahman, a professor of linguistics and
South Asian studies at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad, wrote
recently in a Pakistani daily newspaper. "The conservative syllabi of the
madrasas are about the medieval age. The new subjects are about the
modern world. It is, indeed, the exposure to the new which has
politicized the madrasas, not the continuation of the old."</TE>
<TE>   In this mountainous region that shares both ethnic heritage and a
porous border with Afghanistan, the question of what drives extremism is
far from academic.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a 50-50 story," said Imtiaz Gilani, education minister of
Northwest Frontier Province, where Peshawar is located. "There are a lot
of madrasas that in our books are genuine madrasas. They are providing a
service to extremely poor people by giving them schooling, board and
lodging. They are really philanthropic organizations, and we have no
problem with those. Then there are madrasas that are giving militant
training and little more. There is some problem with what to do with
these other schools."</TE>
<TE>   So far, Gilani has done nothing about the estimated 3,700 madrasas in
the province sprinkled throughout urban areas, such as Peshawar, and the
remote mountains ruled by tribal leaders. "I have not been ordered or
given a clear line to go into the field," he said. "It's federal policy
and they are fine-tuning it."</TE>
<TE>   Gilani assures that when the time comes, ending the military training
conducted at some madrasas will leave the extremist movements to "die a
natural death." He notes that religious leaders failed last fall to
muster impressive crowds to protest the U.S. bombing campaign in
Afghanistan. Lately, they have expressed only muted opposition to
changing curricula.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the more openly reprobate madrasas, meanwhile, seem to be
sensing the changing political winds.</TE>
<TE>   The vast Haqqania school about 25 miles east of Peshawar, which boasts
of having educated 95% of the Afghan Taliban leadership, has vowed to bar
Afghan students from registering, according to Gilani. A roadside
fortress with onion-domed spires, Haqqania is a sprawling and well-funded
campus reminiscent of a parochial high school.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Adil's storefront school lies closer to the norm. It has one
classroom that doubles as a boys' dormitory. Four open latrines with six
cold-water faucets serve as a lavatory and laundry area. There is no
furniture, and students sit on worn prayer mats, listening to hours of
recitation by teachers as their slim torsos bob to the cadence of verse
in Arabic.</TE>
<TE>   Syed Gul's public school is no palace either. Built with German funds
in 1997, Akhunabad is a three-story concrete building with slogans such
as "God Helps Those Who Help Themselves" painted on its sides. During a
recent visit, there was a power blackout, an occurrence that Khan, its
principal, said is common. There are only enough chairs and desks for the
fourth- and fifth-grade classes. Students who found chairs to sit in an
open courtyard took exams under the wan light of a cloudy sky.</TE>
<TE>   There are as many as 40 students to a class, and most have to share
worn textbooks, Khan said. Teachers, even with master's degrees, make
about $65 a month. By the time the provincial school system pays them, it
is left with about 10% of its $166-million annual budget, according to
Gilani. That doesn't leave much to buy furniture, let alone put roofs
over the 422 euphemistically named "shelterless" schools where teachers
instruct out in the elements.</TE>
<TE>   It is no surprise to Gilani that enrollment in the province's 22,375
public elementary schools has declined during the last three years and
stands at 49% of the population in that age group, while private schools,
both secular and religious, have flourished. "People are finding going to
our schools is probably not worth their time, " Gilani acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   Time will tell if Pakistan can make either kind of education
worthwhile to Mohammed and Syed, who grew up amid the ideological rubble
left after the U.S.-backed moujahedeen struggle in Afghanistan. To do so,
Gilani wants to steal back a term from the liturgy of extremism.</TE>
<TE>   "Jihad has become a bad word, because religious bigots have been
associated with it," Gilani said. "But jihad literally translates as
struggle, and I am on a jihad to increase literacy."</TE>

<HD>Volcker Aims to Control Auditor</HD>
<DH>Andersen: The proposal by the former Federal Reserve chairman calls
for Justice Department to suspend its criminal prosecution of the firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker offered to
take charge of the troubled and rapidly diminishing Andersen accounting
firm Friday in what industry experts said was a last-ditch effort to save
the company.</LD>
<LD>   Although the plan drew praise as perhaps the best chance for Andersen
to survive, Volcker said the deal would be conditioned on the Justice
Department's agreeing to dismiss or suspend a criminal indictment of the
accounting firm. He said the plan also would require the approval of a
"significant number" of Andersen partners.</LD>
<LD>   Justice Department officials would not discuss the offer but did not
rule out the possibility of a deal.</LD>
<TE>   "In any corporate criminal matter, the department takes into account
all of the appropriate considerations, including not only any meaningful
reforms but also cooperation and full acceptance of responsibility,"
Justice Department spokesman Bryan Sierra said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the takeover plan, Andersen's senior management would be
overhauled and the company would be governed by a new seven-member board,
led by Volcker.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen is staggering under the indictment, its liability from the
financial meltdown of Houston energy trader Enron Corp. and the growing
number of clients defecting to rival firms.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen named Volcker in February to lead an independent oversight
board to review its operations and procedures after the Enron debacle.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker's intent is to create a model accounting firm that would
forsake consulting and other business to return to the industry's roots
in auditing and tax work.</TE>
<TE>   "We are telling the partners that the time has come to make up their
mind," Volcker said in an interview. "Are there Andersen partners who
want to spend the time and effort on rebuilding and reviving the firm? If
not, the game is over."</TE>
<TE>   The retired central banker made the proposal to Andersen executives
Friday. Andersen executives declined to say whether the firm's management
has signed off on the plan, instead issuing a statement that appeared
supportive but fell short of a definitive answer.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a positive and constructive proposal," the statement said.
"We hope that the Department of Justice will carefully consider Mr.
Volcker's proposal and come to a conclusion based on the best interests
of our capital markets."</TE>
<TE>   As another condition for the takeover, Volcker said attorneys
representing Enron investors and employees in class-action litigation
must agree to cap the firm's liability "to an amount consistent with
sharply reduced and diminishing resources of the firm."</TE>
<TE>   Experts were skeptical that plaintiffs would agree to those terms, and
the initial response from the University of California Board of Regents,
the lead plaintiff in the litigation, was not positive.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever is leading Andersen in the future does not, however, alter
the nature of Andersen's past role in the Enron fraud," said Trey Davis,
spokesman for the UC regents. "Without full discovery of those
activities, it would not be appropriate to comment favorably this early
in the case upon a proposed limit on Andersen's Enron liabilities."</TE>
<TE>   Volcker said the class-action litigants needed to be realistic.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't squeeze money out of a lemon, and there is not much there
now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He described Andersen as reeling from the defection of major clients
and foreign offices, combined with the pressures of the federal
indictment on an obstruction-of-justice charge for destroying documents
sought in the probe of its Enron work.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker said he needed a response in a "matter of days" or the plan
would die.</TE>
<TE>   His new board to govern the company would include J. Michael Cook,
former chairman of accounting firm Deloitte &amp; Touche; Russell Palmer,
former dean of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania; and
Charles Bowsher, former comptroller general of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The other members are John Bogle, retired chairman of the Vanguard
Group; P. Roy Vagelos, retired chairman of pharmaceuticals giant Merck &amp;
Co.; and former U.S. Sen. John C. Danforth of Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   "As a group, we are interested in reforming the accounting profession,
and we believe that Andersen can be the vehicle and model for that
reform," said Volcker, 74. "Not one person on this board is interested in
running Andersen as a career."</TE>
<TE>   Although accounting experts said they liked Volcker's plan, they noted
that there are significant obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   "This looks like the showdown at O.K. Corral," said Lynn Turner,
former chief accountant for the Securities and Exchange Commission and an
accounting expert at Colorado State University. "Volcker has drawn a line
in the sand, and the partners have to decide if they are with him or
against him."</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Bowman, editor of the industry newsletter Bowman's Accounting
Report, said that even if the partners were to line up behind Volcker, it
is not certain that the Justice Department would be willing to dismiss or
suspend its criminal indictment or that attorneys in the class-action
lawsuit would agree to a liability cap.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's daily bleeding of major clients--which on Friday included
Apache Corp., Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Northern Trust Corp.,
Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Waste Management Inc.--has cost the firm
billings equal to nearly 10% of its $4.3 billion in U.S. revenue last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Its affiliates in China, Hong Kong, Russia and New Zealand have
forsaken an Andersen-arranged merger with KPMG in recent days to hook up
with other firms.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker appealed to the Justice Department to consider what he
characterized as the best interests of the financial community, which he
said benefits from Andersen's survival as an audit firm.</TE>
<TE>   "Do they simply want to kill the firm, or is their purpose to see
reforms?" Volcker asked.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Fishman, a former Justice Department lawyer who is in private
practice, said prosecutors are careful about which cases they bring, and
he doubted that they would drop the indictment at this early stage.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't rule it out, but I'd be surprised if they accepted"
Volcker's proposal, Fishman said. "It's very rare for the Department of
Justice to dismiss an indictment outright against a corporation."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen employees, meanwhile, continued a series of public
demonstrations in support of the company against the Justice Department
indictment on one charge of obstructing justice.</TE>
<TE>   In downtown Los Angeles, hundreds of Andersen employees rallied with
chants that could be heard from blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   "This indictment affects the integrity of the firm I have been linked
to for 13 years, and it's unfair," said Jan Miyoda, director of
operations for the audit and business advisory practices division in Los
Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Bush Outlines Terms for Foreign Aid Recipients</HD>
<DH>Summit: Proposal would require poor nations to show gains in
economic and democratic reforms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>MONTERREY, Mexico
</DL>
<LD>With missionary zeal, President Bush on Friday sought to redefine
the terms of foreign aid, as he called on scores of world leaders to join
him in a new U.S. funding initiative that requires developing nations to
commit to free trade, political liberty and human rights.</LD>
<LD>   In an address here at the United Nations Conference on Financing for
Development, the president denounced "a failed status quo" that provides
aid without measuring results. "Developed nations have a duty to not only
share our wealth," Bush said. "We must tie greater aid to political and
legal and economics reforms."</LD>
<LD>   Bush said he will work with Congress to jump-start the initiative
rather than wait until the 2004 budget year--as he had announced last
week in unveiling what is being called the Millennium Challenge Account.</LD>
<TE>   At the aid conference Friday, the president laid out the principles
and the rationale for the new initiative, which by 2006 would increase
U.S. foreign aid from $10 billion annually to $15 billion--with strings
attached.</TE>
<TE>   After Bush's initial announcement last week, many in Washington hailed
his intention to ask Congress for the added funding. But some, including
House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), called on Bush to act
more quickly to secure and then deliver the new aid.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's initiative is, in part, an answer to criticism in the
international community that the United States gives too little in
foreign aid. The U.S. spends far less on such aid as a percentage of its
economy--0.1% of its gross domestic product--than many other wealthy
nations.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush made clear Friday that he believes it is wrong to measure
merely the amount given.</TE>
<TE>   "For decades, the success of development aid was measured only in the
resources spent, not the results achieved," Bush said. "Yet pouring money
into a failed status quo does little to help the poor and can actually
delay the progress of reform. We must do more than just feel good about
what we are doing. We must do good."</TE>
<TE>   When a developing nation embraces sound policies, every dollar it
receives in foreign aid can attract $2 in private investment, the
president said.</TE>
<TE>   "We must build the institutions of freedom, not subsidize the failures
of the past," Bush told other leaders here during a morning session.</TE>
<TE>Poverty Battle Can Help End Terrorism, Bush Says</TE>
<TE>   The president also linked his initiative to the global fight against
terrorism, which he described as a "titanic struggle" that would make the
world safer. By fighting poverty and hopelessness, Bush said, the
developed world can eradicate conditions that allow terrorists to thrive.</TE>
<TE>   The president has ordered Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill to develop "a set of clear and
concrete and objective criteria" that he said will be applied "fairly and
rigorously" to developing nations seeking U.S. aid.</TE>
<TE>   The requirements for developing nations under the Millennium Challenge
Account include investments in education and public health and
sustainable budget policies.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday evening, Bush met with Mexican President Vicente Fox to
discuss a panoply of regional and bilateral issues, including a joint
program dubbed Partnership for Prosperity, which the two leaders unveiled
in February 2001. It is designed to encourage business investments in
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Because of Bush's focus on the war on terrorism, little progress has
been made on the program, or on ambitious immigration reforms that both
men want to implement.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush said Friday that he won't allow U.S.-Mexican issues to be
sidetracked.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States has no more important relationship in the world
than the one we have with Mexico," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico, however, was expecting some specific and short-term
concessions from Bush on border infrastructure, water rights and
immigration--and it was disappointed. One bright spot: a U.S. commitment
to speed vehicle, trade and pedestrian traffic with computerized "smart"
border technology to cut wait times.</TE>
<TE>   The Partnership for Prosperity program sets ambitious goals for U.S.
help in the areas of housing, remittances and small-business loans
without specifying dollars or timelines.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's goal of obtaining legal status for about 3 million Mexican
migrants in the United States seems no closer than it was Sept. 7, when
the two chiefs of state ended a summit with Bush saying he was willing to
consider such a move.</TE>
<TE>U.S. Is 'Moving in the Right Direction'</TE>
<TE>   Among leaders at the conference Friday, reaction to Bush's proposals
on foreign aid was generally positive.</TE>
<TE>   Romano Prodi, president of the European Commission, said the United
States is "moving in the right direction. . . . This is a strong
engagement, a definite change."</TE>
<TE>   Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said Bush's plan contains many
"positive elements, including the push for more education, more
democracy, more investment."</TE>
<TE>   Aznar credited the prospect of the Monterrey summit and its theme of
helping impoverished nations with having prompted leaders of the United
States and Europe to dig into their pockets and come up with concrete aid
commitments.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders at the conference Friday ratified the so-called Monterrey
Consensus, a statement that commits wealthy nations to increase aid while
poor nations promise to institute legal and democratic reforms.</TE>
<TE>   But many economists, including those at the United Nations who track
Latin America, say massive increases in trade and foreign investment in
the region over the last decade have failed to raise income or produce
job growth.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the "trade first" approach to development say billions of
dollars in investment have led to growth in skilled jobs but not
blue-collar employment.</TE>
<TE>   Also, foreign investors who have bought or started companies in Latin
America often import many of the components they use to manufacture
goods, depriving the local economy of the ripple effect often associated
with such investment.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the discussions of international assistance, this rather staid
summit was abuzz over the Cuban government's charge that Mexican
officials, at the behest of the Bush administration, had pressured
President Fidel Castro to leave town before Thursday's dinner.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference here Friday night, Bush and Fox denied that
anyone had pressured Castro to leave early.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no pressure placed on anybody," Bush said to persistent
questions from reporters. "Fidel Castro can do what he wants to do."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also repeated his desire to see Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
ousted--despite an outpouring of opposition from Arab nations, whose
leaders did not hesitate to make their views known to Vice President Dick
Cheney during his recent tour of the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no imminent plans to use military operations," Bush said.
"But we will deal with Saddam Hussein."</TE>
<TE>   Bush leaves this morning for the Peruvian capital, Lima, where he is
to meet with President Alejandro Toledo. Then the two will meet with the
leaders of Bolivia, Colombia and Ecuador.</TE>
<TE>   Before heading home Sunday, Bush is scheduled to stop in San Salvador,
where he will meet with Salvadoran President Francisco Flores and then
have lunch with him and the leaders of Belize, Guatemala, Nicaragua,
Costa Rica, Honduras and Panama.</TE>

<HD>Lindh Team Offers List of Abuses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Claiming John Walker Lindh was a soldier, not a terrorist, his
attorneys presented new details Friday of his initial weeks in captivity
and said the traumatized young prisoner cooperated with the FBI only in
the hope of ending mistreatment by U.S. authorities.</LD>
<LD>   The defense team also released letters written during that period to
Lindh by his parents in Northern California, who conveyed their love and
eagerness to help him and vented frustration over U.S. officials not
forwarding their mail.</LD>
<LD>   The one-way correspondence covers days of uncertainty, and it was not
until January that his mother, Marilyn Walker, learned he was still
alive.</LD>
<TE>   "You have been in my heart and prayers all these many months of not
knowing where you were," she wrote. "Finding you alive is the answer to
all of those prayers."</TE>
<TE>   Lindh's arrest in late November sparked outrage in the United States,
fueled by video images of a ragged, bearded traitor derided as the
American Talib. He eventually was brought to the Washington area and
indicted by a federal grand jury as a terrorist. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft
branded him "an active, knowing participant" in the war against America.
Lindh will stand trial in August and faces life in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Now his San Francisco legal team is working to soften his image and to
blame the government for misrepresenting his actions in Central Asia. The
court filing Friday was the second in a week in which Lindh's lawyers
have begun to lay out their defense.</TE>
<TE>   Government prosecutors declined to comment on Friday's discovery
motions but are scheduled to respond in court March 29.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, the government claimed Lindh, 21, was a terrorist who met
Osama bin Laden and was trained at the Al Farouk camp in Afghanistan. But
his lawyers insist he was there merely to learn how to be a soldier in
the Taliban army and to fight against the Northern Alliance there.</TE>
<TE>   That central difference promises to be the key battleground in the
trial: whether Lindh truly sought to harm the United States.</TE>
<TE>   To bolster their view, defense lawyers hope to gain access to
statements Lindh made to the FBI after his capture and to keep them out
of the trial on the grounds that he gave them only after harsh treatment
by U.S. authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The defense said in court papers Friday that Lindh was "among Taliban
troops" who surrendered to the Northern Alliance on Nov. 24 near
Mazar-i-Sharif. When some of the captives exploded grenades and attempted
to escape, Lindh was wounded by shrapnel and a bullet.</TE>
<TE>   For several hours, according to the defense, he lay wounded on the
ground until fellow prisoners carried him to the basement of the
Qala-i-Janghi fort.</TE>
<TE>   He remained there for a week. "Mr. Lindh had almost no food, limited
water and virtually no sleep," the defense said.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, U.S. forces fired about 40 missiles at the fort.
Northern Alliance soldiers tossed grenades down basement air vents,
poured oil or gasoline down the vents and set them on fire, and flooded
the basement with freezing water, the defense said. Most of these
prisoners died.</TE>
<TE>   When Lindh emerged around Dec. 1, his lawyers said, he was "in a state
of complete exhaustion and shock."</TE>
<TE>   He was taken into U.S. custody and kept for about a week at a location
near Mazar-i-Sharif.</TE>
<TE>   "He was surrounded by armed guards and held in a room in which the
only window was blocked, making it difficult to discern whether it was
night or day," the lawyers said, adding that he was fed sparingly and
given only minimal medical attention.</TE>
<TE>   They said authorities began interrogating him Dec. 1, after "he was
told he would be provided a lawyer sometime later."</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 3, San Francisco attorney James J. Brosnahan wrote to
top-level officials, including Ashcroft, Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell and CIA Director George J. Tenet, saying Lindh's parents "are most
anxious to meet with" their son.</TE>
<TE>   Brosnahan, noting that Lindh appeared to be wounded and hungry, also
asked that the interrogation be stopped, "especially if there is any
intent to use it in any subsequent legal proceeding."</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 4, Brosnahan wrote to the Pentagon, saying that he and Lindh's
parents wanted to visit the prisoner.</TE>
<TE>   "John is a scholarly and religiously motivated individual, who, at the
age of 16, converted to Islam. His religious and scholarly interest in
Islam, the Koran and the Arabic language is well established and brought
him into his present situation," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   That same day his father, Frank R. Lindh, sent a letter via the Red
Cross.</TE>
<TE>   "Mama and I love you very much and are trying to find out where you
are being held," he wrote. ". . . Please ask the U.S. authorities to
allow me, Mama, and the lawyer to come visit you as soon as possible. I
hope you're feeling OK."</TE>
<TE>   Brosnahan and the family heard nothing back about the young man's
situation. Unknown to them, the interrogation in Afghanistan continued
until Dec. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Then Lindh was airlifted to Camp Rhino, near Kandahar, Afghanistan.
"During the flight, he was blindfolded and bound with plastic cuffs so
tight they cut off the circulation to his hands," the defense said in the
court papers. "Soldiers threatened him with death and torture."</TE>
<TE>   At the American military base, "Mr. Lindh's clothes were cut off him,
his hands and feet were again shackled, and he was bound tightly with
duct tape to a stretcher. Still blindfolded and completely naked, he was
then placed in a metal shipping container."</TE>
<TE>   Lindh had no heat source, lighting or insulation in the container, the
defense said. Eventually a blanket was placed under the stretcher, and
one atop him. But "he slept little, if at all."</TE>
<TE>   There he remained until about Dec. 10. Still blindfolded and "in a
state of complete exhaustion," he then was taken to a nearby building or
tent, where he was met by an FBI agent.</TE>
<TE>   "When Mr. Lindh asked for a lawyer, he was told there were no lawyers
there," the defense said.</TE>
<TE>   So he talked, because "Mr. Lindh believed that the only way to escape
the torture of his current circumstance was to do whatever the FBI agent
wanted."</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 13, Brosnahan complained in a letter to FBI Director Robert
Mueller that he had received no response from any of his other letters to
Washington. Lindh's parents, he said, had received only one "short note"
from their son that was dictated to a Red Cross representative Dec. 3 and
arrived in California eight days later.</TE>

<HD>He's Giving Himself Quite a Name</HD>
<DH>Politics: Haim Saban's $7-million donation to Democrats cements the
L.A. rainmaker's clout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE-MARIE O'CONNOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In some rarefied circles, Haim Saban was already well-known as one
of Southern California's political scene-stealers. A parade of
senators--and even a couple of presidents--have made their way to the
door of Saban's neo-French chateau in gated Beverly Park.</LD>
<LD>   Saban is a member of a small but potent coterie of Hollywood
rainmakers the Democratic Party counts on to raise millions for
candidates and campaigns. But on Thursday, it was revealed that Saban
gave the Democratic National Committee $7 million--among the largest
gifts ever received by a major national party.</LD>
<LD>   When Saban informed Democratic Party Chairman Terry McAuliffe of the
sum he would donate, McAuliffe told him: "You're the man!" Saban recalled
Friday.</LD>
<TE>   And in a way, he is. Saban's political gifts--and his ability to get
others to give too--have built a high-profile platform for a cartoon
baron whose fortune rests on "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" and "Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles."</TE>
<TE>   Saban still likes to call himself a "cartoon schlepper."</TE>
<TE>   But late last year, Saban was made capital campaign chairman of a DNC
effort to raise $32 million to build a new party headquarters in
Washington. Last month, he was named to the University of California
Board of Regents by Gov. Gray Davis, whom Saban and Saban Entertainment
have given more than $600,000 since 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Saban links his political activism to his concern for such issues as
education, Middle East peace, social justice and abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a passion about what's going on in the world," said Saban, an
unpretentious man with thick black hair and a gym-toned physique who
looks much younger than his 57 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a concerned person," he said, with a light Israeli accent.
"Whatever I can be helpful with, I'd like to be helpful with."</TE>
<TE>   "I never want to see a woman's right to choose go away," he said. "I
want to see a universal health care system."</TE>
<TE>   Campaign finance reform, of course, could soon drastically change the
rules of the game that have allowed Saban and his enterprises to donate
$2 million to Democratic causes since 1999, according to records.</TE>
<TE>   "I am all for campaign reform," Saban said. But for now, "The law
today is the law today."</TE>
<TE>   And the law today has turned Saban's 90210 ZIP Code into a
fund-raising hot spot where political contributions rose from $2 million
in the 1994 election cycle to $6.2 million in the 2000 cycle. It's a
hefty take, considering the average ZIP Code yielded just under $9,000,
according to the Center for Political Responsiveness.</TE>
<TE>   In the nouveau reaches of high-end Hollywood, hosts like Saban seem to
regard fund-raising parties as a status symbol, not a chore.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent event for Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, (D-R.I.), Saban's wife,
Cheryl, greeted guests in chic leather pants. Waiters offered trays of
tempting gourmet canapes--duck on Belgian endive with raspberry sauce,
wild mushrooms on toast--as co-hosts such as actress Elizabeth Shue
mingled.</TE>
<TE>   The Sabans are a study in contrast as they move through a Hollywood
party populated with such actors as Kevin Costner and Anjelica
Huston -- Cheryl schmoozing with writers, Haim idly toying with
buying a newspaper like, maybe, the New York Post.</TE>
<TE>Contrasting Couple Make Formidable Pair</TE>
<TE>   He is dark and muscular, she willowy and blond. He lacks the aloofness
common to people of his milieu: Socially, he is as warm and effusive as
she is poised and reserved. But together they have become a formidable
couple.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the Sabans sat at a table with former President Clinton at
a $25,000-a-couple banquet for Davis in the home of supermarket magnate
Ron Burkle.</TE>
<TE>   "I doubt if Ron Burkle is looking for anything other than enjoying the
flavor of all those Hollywood parties," said longtime Brentwood
fund-raiser Stanley Sheinbaum.</TE>
<TE>   "Burkle doesn't need anything. But Saban does," Sheinbaum said. "He's
still a new name around town. He's still on an upward climb. He's got his
name on a building in Westwood, but he wants it around."</TE>
<TE>   Al Gore may have reproached Saban in the past for the violent content
of his children's programming, but he dropped in to dine at Chez Saban
recently. The Sabans hosted a series of casual dinners, at another Saban
home in Malibu, for visiting senators during the congressional break. On
March 4, Saban and Burkle co-hosted a fund-raiser honoring Tom
Strickland, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate from Colorado. The
contribution was $2,000 a person.</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, such fund-raising is facilitated by full-time political
staffers, some of them Clinton veterans. Saban's political advisor, Laura
Hartigan, was finance director of the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign. Ari
Swiller, who works for Burkle, used to work in the White House.</TE>
<TE>   When a politician plans a swing through Los Angeles, "the DNC will try
to get heavy hitters on the hook" and Hollywood political staffers "will
make that happen," said a Democratic fund-raising strategist.</TE>
<TE>   Saban and fund-raising honchos like Burkle have written outsize checks
for California races as well. Burkle and his Yucaipa Cos. have given Gov.
Davis nearly $533,000 since 1987, records show. Westwood One radio
Chairman Norm Pattiz, a friend of Saban's, has given $356,000.</TE>
<TE>   And Pattiz, like Saban, also was just named to the UC Board of
Regents. Both give to education philanthropies, but neither is a college
graduate.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that the fact that I am a supporter of the governor had
much to do with it, to be honest," Saban said. "The governor and I spend
a lot of time together and we exchange views. He saw my concern for
education, and it is his job to put in place people who have passion for
the issues he's responsible for."</TE>
<TE>   Pattiz has a slightly different spin.</TE>
<TE>   "Did it help me to be a longtime friend and supporter of the governor
to be appointed to the Board of Regents? Absolutely," Pattiz said. "As a
friend, [Davis] knows of my interest in education."</TE>
<TE>   Sheinbaum shakes his head.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you believe Haim Saban was just made a regent?" said Sheinbaum,
who was on the UC board from 1977 to 1989. "What are we talking about
here?"</TE>
<TE>   He shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a good case with Gray Davis," he confessed. "When I was a
supporter of Jerry Brown, Gray Davis was his chief of staff. Gray got my
appointment cleared with the Board of Regents. I was very appreciative."</TE>
<TE>Funding a New Party Foundation</TE>
<TE>   In the past eight years, Saban has developed a close friendship with
DNC Chairman McAuliffe and with Democratic congressional leaders--House
Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt and House Minority Whip Nancy
Pelosi--who have played a role in guiding more fund-raisers to cash-rich
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   His $7 million forms the foundation of the $32-million effort to build
a party headquarters. Its centerpiece is a technology overhaul project
that will purchase voter files, redo Web sites and e-mail lists to
broaden the base of potential donors.</TE>
<TE>   Such contributions may soon be more important than ever, now that
Congress has passed a bill to overhaul campaign finance laws. President
Bush says he will sign the law, which, after the fall elections, would
prohibit national political parties from raising huge sums from a single
source--donations like Saban's $7 million.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview before the Senate cleared the bill Wednesday, Saban
endorsed such an overhaul of campaign finance law.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they should take campaign finance reform even further by
limiting private individuals," Saban said. "Otherwise I think we're
creating a whole new category of rich people who may or may not be
qualified to be public servants who would have a better opportunity to
serve than others. That's a very dangerous path."</TE>
<TE>   Saban's journey from Israeli rock guitarist to Los Angeles political
impresario has been long and improbable.</TE>
<TE>   Saban was working as a music promoter in Israel in 1973 at the
outbreak of the Yom Kippur War. Profitability evaporated.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to Paris, where he unwittingly turned a 9-year-old club
singer into the "Israeli-French Donny Osmond" when he invited the child
to perform a French theme song for a Japanese cartoon. The song sold 3.5
million copies.</TE>
<TE>   More music revenues followed. Saban and his partner moved to Los
Angeles in 1983 and began buying obscure Japanese cartoons and
repackaging them for U.S. markets.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, Saban banked about $1.5 billion as his share of the
sale of Fox Family Worldwide Inc., an empire built on television shows,
like the "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers," that were criticized by adults
as violent and lowbrow but embraced by children.</TE>
<TE>   Saban's rise has been so swift that books on Hollywood politics
published a decade ago don't even mention him.</TE>
<TE>   One friend who recommended the Sabans to an exclusive Westside private
school recently found herself explaining that, aside from having nice
kids, the Sabans could be assets. Literally.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the director of the school, 'Do you want a new swimming pool?
Do you want a new building? Do I need to be more blunt?' " said the
friend, who asked not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   But in some circles, he needs no introductions. Along with billionaire
Eli Broad and Nancy Daly Riordan, wife of former Mayor Richard Riordan,
Saban successfully lobbied for permission to build mega-mansions that
block the public views of the ocean in violation of state regulations.
The group purchased an oceanfront lot which they offered to turn over to
the state for a public beach in return for the right to build the houses.</TE>
<TE>   The Sabans met when she answered an ad in the Hollywood Reporter and
went to work for him. She was 36, a divorced single mother with two
daughters who used such philanthropic services as the Los Angeles Free
Clinic to make ends meet. Now the Sabans are such big clinic supporters,
"I think we even have a wing there," he joked.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfathomable to me that in a country like ours, kids go around
with no health insurance, and minorities get inferior health care than
white people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Saban adopted Cheryl's girls, and the couple had two more children.
And Cheryl, now 50, is a leading philanthropist and sometime author with
a dry wit, who seems to play straight woman to her more extroverted
husband.</TE>
<TE>   Once he woke her up at 5:30 a.m. to tell her a new cartoon name:
Samurai Pizza Cats. "I feel for you," she told him--and went back to
sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Now Saban is weighing his next business move.</TE>
<TE>   He's got a high-powered New York publicist, Stephanie Pillersdorf, who
openly debates whether to grant the New York Times Magazine access for a
Saban profile or to hold out--in classic Hollywood style--for a magazine
that promises to put him on the cover.</TE>

<HD>Generating Pure Profits With Electricity Trading</HD>
<DH>Energy: Some companies made a killing in state's wide-open market.
Consumers pay the price.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The year was 1998, and a mighty corporate sea change was gathering
power inside an old ice rink in downtown Tulsa, Okla.</LD>
<LD>   Gone were the skaters. In their place were a bunch of amped-up
electricity traders, equipped with top-of-the-line computers and the
latest in meteorological technology. From behind their blinking consoles,
they were ready to make money the new way: trading electrons in
California's freshly deregulated energy market.</LD>
<LD>   The transformation of the rink by Tulsa-based Williams Cos. was
symbolic of the swift and sweeping way that energy trading would alter
the economic landscape--both for Williams and for California consumers.
The deals transacted inside the converted rink would earn Williams record
profits, help trigger the energy crisis, focus national attention on a
new kind of market and trading, and, ultimately, land Williams in court.</LD>
<TE>   To launch its bold venture in 1998, Williams teamed up with another
mega-firm, AES Corp., to control energy generated by three plants
formerly owned by Southern California Edison, plants that have towered
over the coast for half a century. Suddenly, Williams, a conservative
company that had started out building sidewalks, owned enough juice for 4
million homes, more than enough to become one of the biggest energy
players in California.</TE>
<TE>   Today, however, Williams is one of several defendants in a lawsuit
filed last week by the state of California. The suit alleges that the
companies manipulated energy markets in order to boost prices, charges
that Williams and the    others have denied. Williams' contracts with the
state also have been contested, and the company has been forced to shore
up its balance sheet in the wake of Enron-related accounting concerns.</TE>
<TE>   In its simplest terms, Williams sold the rights to power that would be
produced in Southern California for more than a decade to a company that
sold them again, to a company that sold them yet again. With each
transaction, those same electrons that cost pennies to produce were sold
for a higher price. Finally, vastly inflated in value, that power found a
last buyer: the state of California.</TE>
<TE>Power Plants Put on the Block</TE>
<TE>   A central requirement of California's 1996 deregulation law was that
the three largest investor-owned utilities sell at least half their
generation plants. Otherwise, lawmakers reasoned, utilities would retain
too much control over supply and could manipulate prices.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the state's three big utilities--Pacific Gas &amp; Electric,
Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric--would put up for
auction more than 20 plants.</TE>
<TE>   Williams didn't want any of them. It simply wanted to market and trade
the electricity generated by the plants, which another company would own
and operate for an annual fee.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Virginia-based AES, the world's largest independent power
generator.</TE>
<TE>   "We never saw a power plant we didn't want to own for the right
price," said AES Vice President J. Stuart Ryan. "If there are plants for
sale, whether it is in Nigeria or California, we're a player."</TE>
<TE>   The fit between Williams and AES was natural. Williams didn't want to
sink huge sums into buying plants and AES didn't want the financial
uncertainties of trading electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in 1997, there would be three auctions--one for the plants
of each of the state's investor-owned utilities.</TE>
<TE>   The first two times, AES was outbid.</TE>
<TE>   But in early 1998 when the bids were opened for three big Southern
California Edison plants, AES finally triumphed.</TE>
<TE>   The company agreed to pay $781 million for the Edison plants in Long
Beach, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach--more than than three times the
listed book value of $224 million.</TE>
<TE>   The other plants across the state fetched similarly--and
unexpectedly--high prices, an ominous sign for consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "The moment that those plants were sold at two to three times book
value, people should have known that electricity prices were on the
increase," said National Energy Marketers Assn. President Craig Goodman.
"That is a clear indication that there is a scarcity in the marketplace."</TE>
<TE>   After landing the Edison plants, talks between AES and Williams
intensified, shifting among New York, Washington and Tulsa.</TE>
<TE>   Executives in both companies understood the vast scope of what was on
the table: control of a broad swath of electricity production in the
heart of the Los Angeles Basin, the backbone of the Edison supply system.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving the outside negotiations to a colleague, Phil Scalzo, a
loquacious Easterner in a company of laconic Oklahomans, went to work on
Williams' upper management. Because of the company's cautious approach to
business, Scalzo said, he knew "there was going to be as much deal-making
on the inside as on the outside--a lot of educating, promoting,
explaining."</TE>
<TE>   Foremost, he would have to persuade Chief Executive and Chairman Keith
E. Bailey, a soft-spoken engineer, the first non-family member to head
the company in its 93-year history. (Bailey recently gave up the CEO
position and is expected to retire as chairman in May.)</TE>
<TE>   Williams had sat on the sidelines the last time such an opportunity
arose, when the natural gas market opened to competition in the mid-1980s
and other companies, such as Enron and Dynegy, made fortunes pioneering
the same sort of trading operations. Now, there was a second chance.</TE>
<TE>   In May 1998, Williams and AES announced an accord unmatched in size
and symbolism, a multibillion-dollar show of confidence in the future
profitability of electricity deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   Under their so-called tolling agreement, AES gave Williams control of
the volume and price of electricity generated by the three plants for 20
years. Williams would supply the natural gas to fuel them and keep all
the money from the sale of the electricity. AES also agreed to make sure
the plants complied with pollution rules.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, Williams would make fixed annual payments to AES totaling
more than $3 billion over the life of the contract. That positioned
Williams to make money in two ways, on power but also as a major gas
producer, trader and pipeline company at a time when demand for gas-fired
electricity would soar.</TE>
<TE>   "Short of one utility buying another utility," said Scalzo, "this was
going to be the largest power transaction ever done."</TE>
<TE>   The deal's huge dollar value reflected the stunning amount of
electricity that was at stake, enough for a major city.</TE>
<TE>   "We were feeling eager to get into the power business, but the size of
this deal scared us," Scalzo said. "All of a sudden we show up with 4,000
megawatts and there was this kind of gasp between me and the chairman of
the board and everyone in between. It was exciting, invigorating."</TE>
<TE>An Army of Traders Addicted to Action</TE>
<TE>   Culture shock had come to Williams. The cautious company with the
impeccable civic credentials was now the employer of an army of
swaggering adrenaline junkies.</TE>
<TE>   As electricity traders, their job was to make large amounts of money
for Williams--and bonuses for themselves--selling the electricity the
company now controlled to the highest bidders. They peddled this energy
through a variety of "products," from spot market sales to extended
contracts.</TE>
<TE>   The team was headed by a young Texan named Greg Hickl, who got his
start in 1994 as a natural gas trader for Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "A competitive nature is a given for a trader," Hickl said. "That's
why you see a lot of ex-athletes, Delta Force people, Navy SEALs and
snipers littered throughout the industry."</TE>
<TE>   Although far from the energy industry epicenter in Houston, the
Williams trading operation was as slick as any.</TE>
<TE>   The old ice rink, all 81,500 square feet of it, had enough high-tech
work space for more than 500 traders and researchers, supported by six
full-time meteorologists who assessed how changes in weather could affect
demand in different regions.</TE>
<TE>   But no amount of spending or wishing could change the realities of the
California marketplace. The first two years of deregulation brought more
reservations than riches to Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Electricity prices remained stable and relatively low. Demand was not
yet putting pressure on supply because California's economy was just
awakening from a recession. The Pacific Northwest still had plenty of
water coursing through its rivers to generate hydropower for dispatch to
the state.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Williams executives were worried that they were precariously
"long" on electricity, owning too much of the still under-performing
commodity. Wanting to shed some risk, they went shopping for a partner.
They found one on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   The investment firm of Merrill Lynch, like the nation's energy
companies, had been looking for a piece of the deregulation action. It
created a trading arm called Global Energy Markets. Global wanted to own
the rights to a substantial amount of electricity, rather than function
simply as broker or deal-maker for other companies.</TE>
<TE>   So in April 2000, Global bought one-fourth of the 4,000 megawatts
Williams had contracted to buy from AES' Southern California plants. This
meant Williams would have help paying AES during the remaining 18 years
of the contract and Merrill would have a foothold in California.</TE>
<TE>   The parties agreed to keep terms of the transaction secret. But
Williams, eager to let investors know it had reduced its long-term
financial commitment to AES, revealed during a telephone briefing with
Wall Street analysts that it had made a $110-million profit on the deal.</TE>
<TE>   In less than two years, California's once-tightly regulated utility
system had essentially been turned into a cross-country crap game for
high rollers, who were about to hit the jackpot.</TE>
<TE>   By 2001, when California's energy crisis was raging, Merrill's 1,000
megawatts had made it one of the nation's top 20 power traders. Federal
records show that Merrill was selling energy for as much as $813 a
megawatt-hour in the first quarter of 2001--compared to $108 the year
before.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, of course, was also in the money. Some of its traders were
pocketing bonuses of $200,000, on top of their $100,000-plus salaries,
according to their boss, Hickl. Bonuses of $1 million were not uncommon.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' marketing and trading operation booked more than $2 billion
during the past two years, an unknown percentage of that from California.</TE>
<TE>Profits So High That Regulators Smell a Rat</TE>
<TE>   For Williams and other suppliers, California had produced an
embarrassment of riches--so much so that multiple inquiries were launched
into whether the market was being manipulated.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was among five energy marketers accused of price gouging by
the state's grid operator. From the third quarter of 1999 to the third
quarter of 2000, the company's income increased 342%, according to a
study by the California Independent System Operator, known as Cal-ISO.</TE>
<TE>   William Hobbs, president and chief executive of marketing and trading
at Williams, said most of the money made by the company was not cash in
hand but earnings to be paid over time from long-term contracts. That is
known in the business as "mark-to-market" accounting and involves using
cost projections to forecast future profits. The procedure is the same as
that used by Enron and other energy companies and has come under scrutiny
since the Enron bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   But along with its long-term contracts, Williams also was extremely
active in the California short-term markets, where unprecedented prices
were being charged.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, meanwhile, was accused by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission of profiting from suspicious plant shutdowns that drove up the
prices Cal-ISO paid for emergency power by as much as 1,100%.</TE>
<TE>Suspicious Shutdowns Start Up Investigation</TE>
<TE>   The investigation was launched after Cal-ISO complained that two
unscheduled shutdowns at an AES-owned plant forced the grid manager to
pay up to $750 per megawatt hour for power it had contracted to buy for
$63.</TE>
<TE>   On May 5, 2000, AES informed Williams that Unit 2 of its Huntington
Beach plant was out of emission credits and would be shut down. But
Cal-ISO needed the electricity and wanted it from that plant, where it
was obligated to pay just $63 per megawatt-hour. The grid operator
insisted that AES find the credits and keep the plant running.</TE>
<TE>   Later that same day, however, AES came up with another reason for the
shutdown: an accumulation of mussel larvae and debris had clogged cooling
water tunnels and had to be dredged out.</TE>
<TE>   This time, lacking proof to the contrary, the grid operator had no
choice but to consider the outage unavoidable. That allowed Williams to
charge Cal-ISO the dramatically higher rates for power, since its
contract applied to only the now-idled plant.</TE>
<TE>   In that and one other instance examined by federal regulators,
Williams was able to charge Cal-ISO top dollar for substitute power. The
federal energy commission pegged the extra cost in the two cases at $10.8
million.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, as public and political pressure mounted against the
electricity suppliers, Williams agreed to settle for $8 million,
insisting it had done no wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "The settlement took off the table an investigation that we continue
to believe has no factual basis," Bailey, then the company's CEO, said
after that agreement was reached.</TE>
<TE>   As Williams and other energy suppliers wrangled with regulators and
waged war with California politicians, Merrill Lynch decided to take its
considerable profits and run.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen months after jumping into the power-trading business, Merrill
sold its power-trading division to Allegheny Energy Inc., parent company
of a utility serving parts of the Mid-Atlantic states.</TE>
<TE>   The price was $490 million plus 2% of the equity in an Allegheny
subsidiary. Merrill turned over its computers and trading staff. Most of
the cost, however, was for the 1,000 megawatts the Wall Street firm had
earlier bought from Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Electricity produced from the same plants had now changed hands three
times, rising in value each time.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill reported a 5-cent-per-share gain on the sale of "certain
energy trading assets." The profit, Merrill officials confirmed, was $47
million. Williams already had made $110 million on the same megawatts,
and the new owner, Allegheny, would do better yet.</TE>
<TE>   Six days after it concluded its deal with Merrill, Allegheny sold its
power to the state of California as part of one of the long-term
contracts that the state closed in those hectic weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Under that deal, California agreed to pay $4.5 billion to buy power
from Allegheny for 10 years, a deal that could, depending on natural gas
prices and other factors, produce a net profit for the company of about
$1 billion. Allegheny would make that money on power produced in
California but bought and sold four times, first to Williams, then to
Merrill, then to Allegheny and, finally, back to California.</TE>
<TE>   The outlook for Williams today is not as bullish as it was during the
heady days of 1999, 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, the company's stock price has plunged and its credit
rating has been imperiled in the fallout from the Enron fiasco. The firm
is the guarantor of more than $2 billion in debts and lease payments owed
by a shaky former subsidiary. As a result, Williams has been forced to
take dramatic steps to solidify its balance sheet, including by selling
one of its crown jewels, a pipeline that brings natural gas from the
Rockies to California.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, California has moved against Williams and other large
energy companies on two fronts.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the state Public Utilities Commission and the Electricity
Oversight Board filed complaints with federal energy regulators alleging
that Williams, Allegheny and 20 other energy companies overcharged the
state billions of dollars for long-term power contracts.</TE>
<TE>   California asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to modify or
void $45 billion in contracts that the state Department of Water
Resources signed after it began buying power for utility customers in
January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The state estimated that Williams overcharged California about $1.2
billion on several billion dollars in contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "We are more than willing to sit down and discuss the contracts," said
Williams spokeswoman Paula Hall-Collins. "We feel they were entered into
[in] a fair way and offered fair prices and are binding contracts."</TE>
<TE>   Even as that debate continues, state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has moved
against Williams, too. Last week, he sued Williams and three other major
energy companies for at least $150 million, contending the companies
failed to provide emergency power under contracts with the state's power
grid operator. The suits filed in San Francisco Superior Court said the
companies instead sold the power on the lucrative spot markets.</TE>
<TE>   The state said Williams violated rules governing the power contracts
on more than 2,500 occasions between April 1998 and September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Those actions, the state said, jeopardized the reliability and safety
of the transmission grid, drove up prices on the spot market, and caused
California utilities and customers to sometimes pay twice for the same
electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Williams officials were reviewing the suit and had no comment on it,
except to assert that the company has done nothing wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "Williams has operated in a forthright manner," said Hall-Collins,
"and under the rules."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Orders Workers, Families Out of Pakistan</HD>
<DH>Asia: The evacuation of nonessential personnel comes amid concerns
of more attacks and fears that enemy fighters are regrouping in nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The State Department on Friday ordered all but essential employees
at the U.S. Embassy and three consulates in Pakistan to return home, a
move that signaled serious concern with security in the country.</LD>
<LD>   The order was issued five days after an embassy employee and her
17-year-old daughter were killed along with three others in a grenade
attack on a Christian church in the diplomatic quarter of Islamabad, the
Pakistani capital.</LD>
<LD>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, traveling with President Bush in
Monterrey, Mexico, telephoned Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf on
Friday to inform him of the decision, State Department spokesman Philip
T. Reeker said.</LD>
<TE>   Powell told Musharraf that the order didn't reflect a lack of
confidence in his government, its security force or Pakistan's commitment
to protecting Americans, Reeker said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the move underscores mounting worries that Americans
face a likelihood of future attacks in a country that has emerged as a
critical U.S. ally in the region but remains a political tinderbox.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sunday's attack, Reeker said, the department has been reviewing
security surrounding its diplomatic facilities in Pakistan as well as "a
continuous flow of threat information through intelligence channels."</TE>
<TE>   "The threats are such, the environment is such, that we can better
carry out our job by going to this status," Reeker said. Recent State
Department advisories had already warned U.S. travelers to avoid
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The department's facilities in Pakistan include the embassy in
Islamabad and consulates in Lahore, Karachi and Peshawar. All four posts
will remain open and continue to serve travelers in the region, Reeker
said. But children and other dependents of State Department employees, as
well as workers whose jobs aren't critical, will be required to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Reeker declined to say how many department employees are in Pakistan
or how many people will be affected by the evacuation. About 250
Americans left the country in 1998 when a similar directive was issued
after the United States responded to bombings of embassies in Africa by
launching missiles at terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The new order comes amid signs of mounting instability in Pakistan.
U.S. officials said this week that large numbers of Al Qaeda and Taliban
fighters had fled into Pakistan from Afghanistan and might be trying to
regroup there to plot strikes on American targets and individuals.</TE>
<TE>   "If you stood atop the Khyber Pass and looked due south . . . you
could probably see most of the Taliban," said Rep. Porter J. Goss
(R-Fla.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon indicated this week that it might have to launch military
operations inside Pakistan to hunt down members of the Al Qaeda terrorist
network. And CIA Director George J. Tenet warned on Capitol Hill that
Musharraf continues to confront factions violently opposed to Pakistan's
alliance with the United States in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's attack in Islamabad and the kidnapping and killing of Wall
Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl earlier this year underscore "the
challenges that Musharraf faces in his efforts to crack down on Islamic
extremists," Tenet said.</TE>
<TE>   In Sunday's strike, an unidentified attacker rushed into the
Protestant International Church and hurled at least three grenades into
the congregation. The church was just a quarter of a mile from the U.S.
Embassy, and among the dead were embassy personnel officer Barbara Green
and her daughter, Kristen Wormsley.</TE>
<TE>   Green's husband, Milton, who worked in the embassy's information
management office, was hospitalized. Their son, Zack, a fifth-grader, was
treated for minor injuries. They have since returned to the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   One of those killed in Sunday's attack is believed to have been the
bomber, although his remains were obliterated and authorities were still
trying to determine his identity.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani officials are investigating possible links between the
attack and a banned Sunni Muslim militant group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, with
ties to the Taliban. The group is believed to have been behind a similar
attack in October at a Christian service in the city of Bahawalpur.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after Sunday's attack, the State Department authorized
nonessential employees and dependents to leave Pakistan voluntarily. But
by Friday, the department concluded that such personnel should be ordered
out, largely because of fears that terrorists will increasingly seek
targets that are more vulnerable than guarded U.S. facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The department's latest travel advisory warns that terrorists' targets
in Pakistan "may include facilities where Americans are generally known
to congregate or visit, such as clubs, places of worship, schools or
outdoor recreation events."</TE>
<TE>   Reeker noted that children of embassy employees are often bused to and
from school in Islamabad.</TE>
<TE>   He said the evacuation would be "orderly" and likely take some time to
complete.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't the roof of the embassy in Saigon," he said, referring to
the dramatic scene near the end of the Vietnam War when U.S. diplomats
were airlifted out of South Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   The four facilities subject to the order are closed through Monday, a
holiday in Pakistan.</TE>

<HD>Egyptians Reject Jet Crash Report</HD>
<DH>Reaction: The U.S. conclusion that a co-pilot deliberately downed a
1999 flight is seen as biased or uninformed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO
</DL>
<LD>A headline in Egypt's top newspaper Friday demonstrated how this
conservative Muslim nation is reacting to a U.S. report that an EgyptAir
co-pilot intentionally sent a passenger jet plummeting into the ocean in
1999: "American authorities intentionally withheld information and did
not solve the mystery of the crashed plane."</LD>
<LD>   That was what readers were served up in Al Ahram, the government-owned
daily, a day after the National Transportation Safety Board formally
announced that Egyptian co-pilot Gamil El Batouty deliberately downed the
plane, killing all 217 people on board.</LD>
<LD>   There was no mention here of NTSB conclusions that the plane's
mechanical and control systems were in working order, or that Batouty
disengaged the autopilot, or that he methodically plunged the plane into
the Atlantic Ocean off Massachusetts.</LD>
<TE>   Egyptians, instead, have fixated on "the leak": Shortly after the
plane went down, U.S. investigators leaked to the media their suspicion
that Batouty was responsible, in part because he was heard on the voice
data recorder saying, "Tawakalt" (I rely on God).</TE>
<TE>   Egyptians use this phrase routinely, and they immediately jumped on
the U.S. allegation as the result of religious bias or cultural
illiteracy. To this day, that view has framed the debate for the
government-owned airline, the government leadership and the family of the
accused.</TE>
<TE>   "The report is nonsense, nonsense," said Mohammed Nabil El Batouty,
the co-pilot's cousin. "It's a kind of evasion from liability to pay
insurance. Gamil was always a competent pilot--I mean, he wouldn't do
something like this."</TE>
<TE>   Coming at a time when many Egyptians are feeling misunderstood and
persecuted by the West as a result of the U.S.-led war on terrorism, the
case of the EgyptAir crash seemed to exacerbate a sense of victimization
that has gripped this nation.</TE>
<TE>   From a neighborhood grocer to Egypt's top crash investigator, the U.S.
findings have been dismissed out of hand, much the way many people here
dismissed the videotape released by Washington that showed Osama bin
Laden acknowledging advance knowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the Americans to reinvestigate the case, as they have not
considered several points presented by Egyptian investigators," including
proper checks on the plane's tail, cockpit voice recordings and radar and
flight-control data, said Mohsen El Messiri, head of Egypt's
investigating committee.</TE>
<TE>   EgyptAir Flight 990, bound for Cairo, took off from John F. Kennedy
International Airport on Oct. 31, 1999, about 1:20 a.m. Not long
afterward, the Boeing 767 plummeted 33,000 feet into the ocean. When
investigators recovered the two flight recording devices, they heard what
they considered to be the first evidence of wrongdoing: The plane was
flying normally when Batouty said, "I rely on God"--an invocation he
could be heard saying a total of 11 times on the cockpit voice recorder.</TE>
<TE>   Further physical evidence showed that Batouty then sent the jet into a
nose dive, while the pilot of the plane, Capt. Ahmed El Habashi,
struggled to save the flight. In a story published March 15 in The Times,
former EgyptAir Capt. Hanofy Taha Mahmoud Hamdy said the crash was a
vengeful act against EgyptAir executive Hatem Rushdy, who was seated in
first class when the plane went down. Taha--who is seeking asylum in
London--told The Times that a few hours before the flight, Rushdy had
reprimanded Batouty for alleged sexual misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   None of this is swaying public opinion here, not among journalists,
academics, government officials or investigators. Egypt is desperate to
revive tourism, its No. 1 source of hard currency. After the Sept. 11
attacks, the tourist business dropped off sharply, and it has only just
begun to recover. The NTSB report isn't likely to bring tourists back,
especially on the national carrier.</TE>
<TE>   People here say they see a pattern in the U.S. approach--first
convicting someone, then finding the evidence to prove the conviction.
That's how many people here view the case against Bin Laden as well as
the one against the co-pilot.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not the only reason Egyptians have trouble with the
findings. Virtually everything that happens here must be viewed through
the prism of the Muslim faith and relations with the Jewish community. As
a society, Egypt is devoted to Islam--and suspicious of Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Suicide is a sin in Islam, and the person who kills himself is no
longer considered a Muslim. So it is difficult, if not impossible, for
people here to understand how Batouty, who had a sick daughter, would
have killed himself while calling on God to protect him. The fact that
the United States has come to this conclusion reinforces the belief among
some people that the Jewish community controls America's government.</TE>
<TE>   "It is impossible for someone to kill himself," said Mohammed Suleiman
Ibrahim, 67, a Cairo grocer. "Maybe the Jews influenced the report. There
is no problem between Egyptians and Americans. If they want to say
something incriminating, they should at least come up with something
logical enough to believe."</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed Mohammed Mahmoud, 24, who said he serves in the military,
expressed a similar suspicion: "The problem is that there are people who
don't want the relations between the Americans [and the Egyptians] to be
good. Maybe Israel, I don't know. Our problem is that . . . Americans
don't know us. So they don't understand that Egyptian people are good and
don't do things like that."</TE>

<HD>Russia Acquits 2 in 'Friendly Fire' Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: Slain commander of elite police unit is blamed for the
deadly incident in Chechnya. Some still believe convoy was ambushed by
rebels.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>The first attempt by Russian authorities to address the problem of
"friendly fire" in the separatist republic of Chechnya fizzled Friday
when a court acquitted two senior police officers and instead laid blame
posthumously on the commander of the targeted unit.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-two men from the OMON elite police force died in the firefight
two years ago in the Chechen capital, Grozny, when officers from one unit
fired on another unit arriving in a column of reinforcements,
investigators say. The incident is considered the worst friendly fire
incident in Russia's two wars in the republic.</LD>
<LD>   The trial has been closely watched in Russia as a measure of the
government's ability to hold police and military officers accountable for
mistakes under their command. Soldiers and police troops complain that
poor battlefield organization and friendly fire incidents lead to
unnecessary deaths and low morale in the Russian armed forces.</LD>
<TE>   "The case was way too scandalous to be hushed up," military analyst
Alexander Golts said. "President [Vladimir V.] Putin, or someone from his
closest entourage, must have issued an unwritten order to find and punish
those who were responsible for such a disgraceful incident."</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the March 2000 incident, Russian officials blamed
Chechen separatists. They said rebel fighters ambushed the arriving
column of military trucks carrying OMON forces as it neared a federal
checkpoint in the northwestern section of Grozny. Russian officials also
accused officers from the newly formed Chechen police force of assisting
the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   The firefight lasted two hours and left 22 Russians dead and 31 others
injured.</TE>
<TE>   Two senior police officers--Maj. Gen. Boris Fadeyev and Col. Mikhail
Levchenko--were accused of negligence for failing to provide adequate
security for the convoy.</TE>
<TE>   The Grozny district court, which convened in a Moscow courtroom
because of high public interest, acquitted both officers. In an unusual
addition, however, the judges said that the commander of the arriving
OMON unit, Dmitry Markelov, was at fault for improperly ordering the
convoy to depart without receiving the proper paperwork. Markelov died in
the firefight.</TE>
<TE>   "Blaming someone who is gone is incomparably easier than finding the
real perpetrators of the crime," said Maj. Andrei Koryavin, acting
commander of the same OMON unit, who said he had never heard of the
paperwork involved. "In fact, today's court hearing did not have anything
to do with finding out who actually killed our guys."</TE>
<TE>   The verdict appeared to satisfy few, including the acquitted
defendants.</TE>
<TE>   "The reasons for the deaths . . . have not been established," said
Liliya Ababkova, Fadeyev's lawyer. "Fifteen months of investigation went
in fact down the drain."</TE>
<TE>   Many police officials, including the second defendant, Levchenko,
continue to insist that the incident was an elaborate rebel ambush.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an action painstakingly planned by the rebels," Levchenko said
as he left the court. "I intend to issue a statement on this."</TE>
<TE>   The question of who fired first remains unclear, complicated by the
presence at the scene not only of the two OMON units but also of groups
of ordinary police officers from Chechnya and other regions of Russia. In
addition, according to documents from the prosecutor general's office
made available to The Times, OMON and the Grozny-based police had
received apparently incorrect intelligence that a group of rebels posing
as police would be arriving in the capital that day.</TE>
<TE>   Critics such as Golts accuse the Interior Ministry of being slow to
come to terms with the incident and contend that only pressure from the
Kremlin forced the trial. Golts described Fadeyev and Levchenko as
"scapegoats."</TE>
<TE>   "No one in the ministry, knowing what horrible mess and chaos
accompany every single ministry operation in Chechnya, would ever risk
exposing the ministry's dirty linen to the public gaze," Golts said. "It
was much more convenient and less embarrassing for the top-ranking people
at the Interior Ministry to say that the OMON unit was decimated by the
Chechens rather than by their fellow policemen. Dying in real combat is
less ignominious than being killed by mistake by your own guys."</TE>
<TE>   Koryavin, the acting commander of the OMON unit, lamented that
although the investigation officially remains open, the case is likely to
languish.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing is clear--if the real perpetrators have not been found over
the past two years, it is very unlikely that they ever will," he said.</TE>

<HD>American Embassy in Bosnia Halts Activity After Threat</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Embassy shut down all operations Friday because of a
terrorist threat, just days after police raided an Islamic charity,
arrested an espionage suspect and seized bogus passports, weapons and
plans for making bombs, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The embassy in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina's capital, had reduced
operations Wednesday after receiving word of a possible terrorist threat.
On Friday, it got new information "that prompted us to take further
precautionary measures and close the embassy entirely," spokeswoman Karen
Williams said.</LD>
<LD>   "We are reassessing the situation continually and will reopen when
appropriate," she said.</LD>
<TE>   No other details about the nature of the threat were made available by
the embassy.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Bosnian police raided an Islamic charity, Bosnian Ideal
Future, formerly known as the Benevolentia International Foundation.
Police said some employees of the charity were conducting activities
unrelated to humanitarian work.</TE>
<TE>   Police reported Friday that they had arrested a man with links to the
charity, but they gave only his initials, M.Z. They did not say when the
arrest was made but said the man was turned over to the investigative
judge of Sarajevo's regional court under "credible suspicion" of
committing espionage.</TE>
<TE>   A Western diplomatic source in Sarajevo, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Tuesday's raid uncovered ski masks, forged passports,
loaded weapons and grenades, as well as manuals for making explosive
devices and booby traps.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Bosnia's government ordered an inquiry into the work of
foreign humanitarian aid agencies. Just two weeks ago, investigators
reported that funds were missing from three Islamic charities, including
the Benevolentia International Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1 million Muslims live in Bosnia, including several hundred
Islamic forces who came to fight on the Muslim side in the war against
the Serbs and Croats. About 3,100 U.S. troops are stationed in the
country with the NATO-led peacekeeping force.</TE>

<HD>U.S.-Afghan Basketball Game Ends in Violence</HD>
<DH>Military: Armed guard protecting a fallen American player wounds

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>A game of basketball between a U.S. and an Afghan team turned
violent when spectators kicked a fallen American player in the head--and
a guard rushing to protect him unintentionally shot and wounded two
Afghans.</LD>
<LD>   The incident Thursday at Kabul's main stadium wasn't the first time an
event staged to foster goodwill with Afghans has gotten out of control,
and an Afghan sports official suggested that the games should be put on
hold until the security situation in the capital improves.</LD>
<LD>   The American squad, which included one British player, pulled out of
the four-day basketball tournament with Afghan teams because of the
violence.</LD>
<TE>   The game was friendly until an American player running for the ball
tumbled near the stands crowded with Afghans celebrating the Persian new
year, said flight Lt. Tony Marshall, a spokesman for the international
peacekeeping force in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Two Afghan spectators kicked the player in the head, according to
Marshall and witnesses, bringing an Afghan guard from the U.S. Embassy to
his defense.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to keep the crowd back, the guard cocked his Kalashnikov rifle
and unintentionally fired off a round as he used it to press back fans,
Marshall said.</TE>
<TE>   Two spectators suffered gunshot wounds to the legs, said a witness,
Wahid Ullah, the stadium's maintenance chief.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. personnel hustled the guard out of the stadium for his safety,
Marshall said. The guard has been turned over to Afghan police.</TE>
<TE>   Sporting official Abdul Zabur Azizi said, "Until our Interior Ministry
is able to control the crowd security, we should not have these kinds of
matches."</TE>

<HD>Ukraine's State Workers Get Drafted for Campaign Duty</HD>
<DH>Europe: Critics point to abuse of administrative resources as
employees are obligated to help out with political activities, which are
illegal for them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY MYCIO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>KIEV, Ukraine
</DL>
<LD>When politician Tetiana Strokan swept into the newly renovated
auditorium at public school No. 241, English teacher Yevhenia Shpilska
was handing out the candidate's colorful campaign booklets at the door.</LD>
<LD>   The 21-year-old teacher isn't a campaign worker. She doesn't even
support Strokan's bid for the 216th District seat in parliament. When
asked why she was handing out campaign materials, Shpilska rolled her
blue eyes as though at higher-ups. "I was told," she said, then
hesitantly amended: "Well, maybe 'asked' is the better word."</LD>
<LD>   In the run-up to Ukraine's elections March 31, numerous government
employees--from bureaucrats to street cleaners--are being "asked" and
"told" to join certain political parties, work on certain election
campaigns, put up selected candidates' posters and tear down those of
competitors. Such election-related activities are not in their job
descriptions and most often are illegal for state employees.</LD>
<TE>   "Abuse of administrative resources is the main problem with these
elections," said Igor Popov, head of the watchdog Committee of Voters of
Ukraine. "It is a form of the corruption that pervades Ukrainian society.
Between elections, public officials use their positions to enrich
themselves. During elections, they use their positions to keep their
positions--to either get elected or to do the bidding of their superiors
in order to keep their jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Echoing the prevailing view, Popov contends that the main abuser of
government resources is the For United Ukraine bloc, the sole coalition
or party to staunchly support President Leonid D. Kuchma, who in turn is
widely believed to be behind much of the pulling of strings.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Administrative resources' is a euphemism, invented to give illegal
actions a neutral name," said Serhiy Teriokhin, the incumbent in District
216.</TE>
<TE>Candidate Accused of Abusing Position</TE>
<TE>   Teriokhin is a candidate from the Our Ukraine bloc, which is led by
former Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko, a popular reformer ousted from
his post last April by parliament. Teriokhin accuses his opponent,
Strokan, of using her position as chief executive of the district to
promote her campaign and interfering with his own, blocking him from
renting public space and tearing down his outdoor ads and posters.</TE>
<TE>   Strokan, a candidate from the Kiev mayor's Unity bloc, which has
divided the Ukrainian capital's administrative resources with For United
Ukraine, is technically on a leave of absence from her government
position. But a reporter who called her campaign headquarters for comment
was referred to another number--in the district's executive offices.</TE>
<TE>   Igor Kolhatyn, the deputy chief executive of health and social
services who also makes a point of telling reporters about Strokan's
stumping schedule, vigorously denied Teriokhin's charges. "It's not our
fault if he can't get people to come to his campaign stops."</TE>
<TE>   Running for his third term in parliament, Teriokhin says with equal
vigor that administrative abuses are the worst he has seen: "These
elections are very cynical."</TE>
<TE>   But the stakes in the elections are high, especially for one person
who isn't running: the president. Mired in scandals, from last year's
allegations of a role in the slaying of a prominent journalist to new
reports of illegal weapons deals, many observers believe that Kuchma is
battling to pack parliament with loyalists--or at least keep out avid
opponents such as the former speaker of parliament, Oleksandr Moroz, and
former Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. Both lead anti-Kuchma
parties that are hovering around the 4% of the national vote needed to
win a portion of the 225 seats in the 450-member parliament, which are
divided proportionately among parties.</TE>
<TE>   "Kuchma needs guarantees of immunity after leaving office in 2004,"
said Yulia Mostova, political editor of the weekly Zerkalo Tyzhdnia. "The
next parliament will decide if he gets it."</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that the authorities must resort to such unlawful and
uncivilized election tactics simply proves how deeply unpopular they
are," Mostova said. She noted that Yushchenko's Our Ukraine bloc is far
in the lead of the 33 parties and coalitions in the running, despite its
chief opponents' use of administrative resources.</TE>
<TE>   With support reaching as high as 33% in some polls, the Our Ukraine
bloc is poised to capture at least 60 proportionally allocated seats. The
bloc's number of seats could grow to 100 or more, potentially making it
parliament's largest faction, depending on how many races Our Ukraine
candidates such as Teriokhin win in the additional 225 "single mandate"
districts, where the candidate with the most votes wins.</TE>
<TE>Unexpected Publicity for a Common Problem</TE>
<TE>   The misuse of state funds, employees and facilities to help certain
parties and candidates and hinder others is not uncommon in transitional
democracies. What is unusual in Ukraine is the extent to which it has
become one of the most publicly discussed issues in the election
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Kuchma and For United Ukraine initially dismissed the complaints as
grousing by outsiders to excuse their small chances of getting into
parliament. But a parade of Western officials have come to Kiev to
criticize the government's interference in the elections. And although
few observers believe that the abuses will lead Western watchdog
organizations to declare the election invalid, the criticism is having an
effect.</TE>
<TE>   "The subject is no longer taboo. People now understand that
administrative abuses are illegal, and that makes them easier to
counter," said Popov of the voters' committee. "The authorities now have
to pretend to fight against the abuses."</TE>
<TE>   That change in attitude might explain why the For United Ukraine bloc,
which is in first place in terms of administrative resources, including
disproportionate time on television news, is in fourth place in surveys,
garnering the support of about 6% of respondents.</TE>
<TE>   "March 31 will be a vote for and against administrative abuses. And
since the bloc that has the administrative resources, For United Ukraine,
is directly linked to the president, it will be a plebiscite on Kuchma as
well," Mostova said. But she added: "If the vote isn't falsified."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>Margaret Thatcher, the indomitable "Iron Lady" who led Britain
through 11 tumultuous years, is retiring from the public stage after a
series of small strokes.</LD>
<LD>   Thatcher, 76, was resting at home in London, her office said.</LD>
<LD>   The office confirmed Friday that the former prime minister had
canceled a speaking engagement Tuesday because of another small stroke.</LD>
<TE>   "They have therefore told her to cut back her program at once and in
particular to avoid the undue strain that public speaking places on her,"
her representative said.</TE>
<TE>   Thatcher led Britain from 1979 until she was ousted by her own
Conservative Party in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   She stirred controversy this week with her new book, "Statecraft," in
which she called for Britain to withdraw from key European Union
institutions.</TE>
<TE>   In excerpts published in the Times newspaper, she said the euro
currency was destined to fail and was "nothing more or less than an
instrument for forging a European superstate."</TE>

<HD>British Court Upholds Woman's Right to Die</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>A paralyzed woman who wants doctors to remove the ventilator that
keeps her alive has a right to die, a British judge ruled Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The case was apparently the first in Britain in which a mentally
competent patient had applied for the right to terminate life-sustaining
treatment.</LD>
<LD>   The High Court ruling was relayed by video link to the hospital
bedside of the woman, identified only as B.</LD>
<TE>   B was paralyzed from the neck down when a blood vessel ruptured in her
neck a year ago, and is unable to breathe unaided. She told the court she
fully understood the implications of being removed from the ventilator
and wanted to die.</TE>
<TE>   Her doctors argued that it would be unethical to switch off the
ventilator.</TE>
<TE>   The judge ruled that B had the necessary mental capacity to give or
refuse consent to life-sustaining medical treatment, adding that for
someone as severely disabled as the patient, "life in that condition may
be worse than death."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement issued through her lawyers, the woman said she was
pleased with the judgment but upset that she had been forced to take
court action.</TE>
<TE>   "The law on consent to treatment is very clear and this has been a
long, and unnecessary and personally painful process," she said. She
hasn't indicated when she will have the ventilator turned off.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital's lawyer, Robert Francis, said he regretted the distress,
"however unintentionally caused," to the patient.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a right-to-die case," Dr. Anthony Cole, chairman of the
independent Medical Ethics Alliance, said. "The judge has upheld the
right to refuse treatment. This has long been the situation of English
law."</TE>

<HD>Bush Asks to Unfetter Anti-Drug Aid</HD>
<DH>Colombia: President seeks to allow use of previous U.S. help and
any new funds to fight rebels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has asked Congress to allow the Colombian
government to use past anti-drug contributions of helicopters, planes,
gunboats and other equipment in its expanding campaign against guerrilla
groups, officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The administration had signaled that it would ask Congress to allow
new aid to be used for "counter-terrorism" activities as well as for the
anti-drug effort. But in a supplemental budget request submitted this
week, the administration seeks to further leverage the efforts against
the rebels by loosening restrictions on previous aid as well.</LD>
<LD>   The supplemental budget request, which includes the unfettering of
past aid, also seeks $35 million in new funding for the current year. The
sum would be in addition to $435 million that the administration has
already requested for Colombia for fiscal 2003.</LD>
<TE>   "This is big," said Adam Isacson, a Latin America expert at the Center
for International Policy, a center-left think tank in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional aides of the two major U.S. parties expect a fight over
the proposal this spring because some lawmakers fear that broadening
military aid could leave the United States mired in a conflict that has
raged for 38 years.</TE>
<TE>   Critics believe that the budget request language permitting use of the
money for "counter-terrorism" defines its purpose so broadly that the
Colombian government "could use it for almost anything," in the words of
one aide.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration aides have been arguing that the United States
needs to quickly step up the battle against the two main Colombian rebel
groups, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the National
Liberation Army. The leftist guerrillas are battling Colombian government
forces and right-wing paramilitary groups.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials contend that Washington should intervene because the
groups pose a threat to democracy and also to Americans directly. They
say Colombian rebels have kidnapped about 120 Americans over two decades;
18 are dead or presumed dead.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials maintain that past U.S. policy, which tried
to limit aid to the anti-drug effort, was unrealistic because the rebels
have increasingly turned to drug trafficking to fund their insurgency.</TE>
<TE>   "The terrorism and narco-trafficking threats tend to merge in their
attempts to undermine Colombian democracy," State Department spokesman
Philip T. Reeker said Friday in a briefing.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. aid to Colombia has been allocated to a variety of purposes,
including building the Latin nation's economy and developing its
democratic institutions.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. anti-drug aid has bought a variety of military equipment
that could be used against the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has appropriated money to provide about 75
helicopters for the Colombian military, according to analyst Isacson,
although not all of the aircraft are ready for operations. He said the
United States has also bought about a dozen helicopters for the Colombian
police and has provided fixed-wing aircraft with sophisticated sensors
and some river gunboats that are armed with machine guns.</TE>
<TE>   If approved, about $25 million of the $35 million in new money would
go to help Colombian authorities improve their techniques in thwarting
kidnappings. Rebel groups abduct Colombians and foreigners to raise
money, and the country is sometimes called the kidnapping capital of the
world.</TE>
<TE>   The total would also include $4 million to help fortify police
stations, especially in outlying areas. Police stations have frequently
come under rebel attack; their destruction has often meant that the
government had no control over parts of its territory.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining $6 million of the requested new aid would be used to
accelerate a proposed program to train newly formed Colombian military
units so that they can protect an important oil pipeline that has come
under frequent rebel attack.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the Bush administration formally requested $98 million
for the coming fiscal year to train Colombian troops to protect the
pipeline. But officials say they want to begin that effort even sooner.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials and their congressional supporters noted that
they aren't seeking to increase the number of U.S. military personnel who
can serve as advisors in Colombia. That number is capped at 400.</TE>
<TE>   And they stressed that they intend to continue to follow the human
rights guidelines contained in the past policy. Under current law, the
United States is barred from assisting any Colombian military units whose
members have been found guilty of human rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference in Washington, Colombian Ambassador Luis Alberto
Moreno said the administration's interest in helping his nation sends a
message to terrorists: "Their days are numbered."</TE>
<TE>   He welcomed the U.S. commitment to help Colombia combat kidnappings,
which total an estimated 3,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   "This has a tremendous impact on foreign investment in the country,"
the ambassador said.</TE>

<LD>More than 2.7 billion people will face severe shortages of fresh
water by 2025 if the world keeps consuming water at today's rates, the
United Nations warned in a report marking World Water Day.</LD>
<LD>   Worldwide, about 5 billion people will be living in areas where it
will be difficult or impossible to meet all their needs for fresh water,
creating "a looming crisis that overshadows nearly two-thirds of the
Earth's population," the report said.</LD>
<LD>   The report was released in Vienna by the International Atomic Energy
Agency, a nuclear watchdog organization leading the U.N. effort to draw
attention to the world's water crisis and urge the launch of a "blue
revolution" to conserve supplies and develop new ones.</LD>

<LD>East Timor's constituent assembly approved the territory's first
constitution in an essential step before it becomes the world's newest
nation in May.</LD>
<LD>   The 88-member democratically elected assembly voted overwhelmingly to
accept the final draft of the constitution, which is loosely based on the
national charter of East Timor's former colonial ruler, Portugal. There
were 72 votes in favor of it and 14 against. One member abstained, while
another was absent.</LD>
<LD>   Assembly President Francisco Guterres hailed the outcome of the vote.
"On 20th May, this [document] will create our independent nation of East
Timor," he said.</LD>

<HD>Report Takes Swiss to Task for War Role</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ZURICH, Switzerland
</DL>
<LD>Switzerland shirked its moral responsibilities to victims of the
Nazis as the Holocaust raged, cloaking itself in neutrality to justify
business as usual with the Axis powers, international historians
concluded Friday.</LD>
<LD>   In a final report after a five-year study of Switzerland's wartime
role, the nine-member panel blasted a refugee policy that turned back
thousands to near-certain death, and the nation's excessive cooperation
with Nazi Germany and failure to return wealth to its rightful owners
when World War II ended.</LD>
<LD>   The emotional debate escalated into a bitter feud that was defused
only when Switzerland's biggest banks agreed in 1998 to pay $1.25 billion
to settle all Holocaust-era claims against the financial institutions,
Swiss industry, the central bank and the government.</LD>
<TE>   Critics lambasted the study as hopelessly slanted.</TE>
<TE>   "A free country should not shell out taxpayers' money to confirm . . .
the opinions that were already in the heads of historians selected on
one-sided political criteria," the right-wing Swiss People's Party said.</TE>
<TE>   However, the government in Bern hailed it as a big contribution to the
public debate on Swiss history and a reminder of how the country and its
leaders at times acted less than honorably.</TE>

<HD>Talks Press On Despite Attacks</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The two sides reportedly are still far apart. The third
suicide bombing in three days wounds Israeli soldiers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>In life, Tzipi and Gadi Shemesh were planning for the birth of
their third child. Instead, they were buried Friday, side by side.</LD>
<LD>   The Shemeshes were killed by a Palestinian suicide bomber Thursday,
minutes after they emerged from a downtown laboratory where they had seen
ultrasound pictures of the baby they were expecting. They had just enough
time to telephone a relative with the news.</LD>
<LD>   Then the bomber blew himself up on Jerusalem's busy King George V
Street, taking with him the Shemeshes and 48-year-old Yitzhak Cohen, a
clothing merchant and father of six who had moved to Jerusalem from a
West Bank settlement for safety's sake.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, a suicide bomber detonated his explosives at an Israeli
army checkpoint near the West Bank town of Jenin, the third such attack
in as many days. Ten Israelis were killed in the two previous days; on
Friday, only the bomber died, while several soldiers were slightly
wounded. The army said the man was trying to travel into Israel when his
taxi was stopped.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the violence, Israeli and Palestinian security officials met
Friday for another round of truce talks under U.S. supervision. The
meeting ended inconclusively, but the fact that it occurred at all was
noteworthy. Israel had canceled Thursday night's session and threatened
reprisals for the suicide attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of immediate retaliation, however, Israel was persuaded to
hold off by U.S. envoy Anthony C. Zinni. The retired Marine Corps general
is trying to push the two sides into a cease-fire in time to allow
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat to meet with Vice President
Dick Cheney early next week, possibly in Egypt, and then travel to the
midweek Arab League summit in Beirut.</TE>
<TE>   Another cease-fire meeting was scheduled for Sunday. Israeli
television quoted Avi Dichter, the head of Israel's internal security
agency, as having warned the Palestinians at Friday's meeting that the
next attack would not go unanswered.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides reportedly were far apart on a timetable for enacting a
truce as drafted last summer by CIA Director George J. Tenet. The plan
envisions, among other steps, Israel pulling back troops while the
Palestinians arrest and disarm militants.</TE>
<TE>   Zinni traveled to the West Bank city of Ramallah on Friday and had
what was described as one of his most tense encounters yet with Arafat.
The body language told the story: During a photo opportunity, Zinni sat
grim-faced, his square jaw locked stone-hard in a frown. Arafat scowled
and slumped in his chair, covering part of his face with his hand.</TE>
<TE>   Zinni accused Arafat publicly Thursday of failing to take action to
stop attacks on Israeli civilians. Under direct pressure from Secretary
of State Colin L. Powell, Arafat went on Palestinian television Thursday
night to order his people to refrain from attacking Israeli civilians in
Israel.</TE>
<TE>   But a top commander of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, an underground
militia affiliated with Arafat's Fatah movement, said Friday that he and
his men were ignoring Arafat's command.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to continue with our armed resistance," said Naser
Oweis, a commander based in the Nablus area of the West Bank. "We will
continue on the path of martyrdom."</TE>
<TE>   Oweis said the Bush administration's decision to put the Al Aqsa
brigade on its list of terrorist organizations is "a medal of honor that
we hang on our chests."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, speaking to diplomats,
delivered an especially bleak assessment of the volatile moment. He said
Thursday's bombing "blew to smithereens" everything that Zinni had worked
to accomplish.</TE>
<TE>   Though it is still unclear whether Arafat will be allowed to travel to
the Arab summit, one of his Cabinet ministers, Nabil Shaath, said the
Palestinian leader won't leave unless he receives guarantees that he will
be allowed to return home.</TE>
<TE>   A segment of the Israeli public, spearheaded by right-wing politicians
such as former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, advocates expelling
Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Three Palestinian deaths were reported Friday, including that of a
4-year-old girl who died of injuries she received during Israeli army
shooting near her home in the Gaza Strip's Rafah area.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis buried the Shemesh couple at Jerusalem's Mt. Herzl military
cemetery. Gadi, 34, was an officer in the army and was entitled to a
military funeral because he died in the line of duty. Only a special
order from the defense minister allowed Tzipi, 32, to be buried with him.</TE>
<TE>   Tzipi Shemesh was five months pregnant when she was killed. The couple
left behind two daughters.</TE>

<HD>Immigrant Law Passes in Germany</HD>
<DH>Europe: Conservatives protest a vote to allow some skilled workers
into the country.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>BERLIN
</DL>
<LD>Germany's Parliament approved a landmark immigration reform measure
Friday, but opposition conservatives walked out in protest, saying the
law's adoption was unconstitutional.</LD>
<LD>   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats won the Bundesrat
upper house vote on the measure to allow a limited number of skilled
foreigners into Germany, but the conservatives would not accept the way
the vote was counted.</LD>
<LD>   The reform, already passed by the lower house, opens Germany to
foreign labor for the first time since the early 1970s.</LD>
<TE>   Schroeder told a news conference the conservatives' assessment that
the vote was unconstitutional is "absurd" and said he did not see the
dispute over the legislation affecting upcoming elections.</TE>
<TE>   "Now there is a law that does justice to Germany's humanitarian wishes
. . . so that those that we need to maintain and expand our economic
prosperity come to us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Rogowski, president of the German Industry Assn., welcomed the
passing of the law, saying it would help firms alleviate skill gaps in
key sectors.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that the topic will no longer be the subject of an
emotionalized election campaign," he said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   After Berlin's Social Democratic mayor, Klaus Wowereit, who holds the
rotating Bundesrat presidency, refused to reverse his decision to declare
the legislation passed, conservatives walked out.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very worried that the constitution has been so brazenly trampled
upon to achieve an alleged political goal," Bavarian Premier Edmund
Stoiber, Schroeder's conservative challenger in the Sept. 22 election,
told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Stoiber, whose conservatives lead in opinion polls, has said Germany
does not need more migrant labor because unemployment is above 4 million
and the country cannot integrate more foreigners.</TE>

<HD>States' Rights at Heart of Oregon Suicide Lawsuit</HD>
<DH>Drugs: Ashcroft tried to bar doctors from helping patients die.
Controlled substances fall under federal rules, U.S. says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.
</DL>
<LD>Oregon went to court Friday to challenge U.S. Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft's attempt to bar doctors from prescribing federally controlled
drugs under the state's landmark assisted-suicide law.</LD>
<LD>   In a case that could define the boundaries of physician-assisted
suicide across the country, Oregon is challenging Ashcroft's threat to
revoke the licenses of doctors who prescribe powerful barbiturate
cocktails to hasten death for patients suffering the ravages of
incurable, painful diseases.</LD>
<LD>   The state has the nation's only physician-assisted suicide statute,
which voters have approved twice since 1994. Over the last four years,
the law has allowed 91 patients to obtain a prescription to end their
lives. The practice was legally sanctioned by the Clinton administration,
but Ashcroft, fulfilling a campaign promise from President Bush, reversed
former Atty. Gen. Janet Reno. He ruled in November that doctors who
prescribe drugs that are intended to kill terminally ill patients are in
violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act.</LD>
<TE>   The case, argued Friday before U.S. District Judge Robert E. Jones,
raises questions about the ability of states to regulate medical
practices and potentially sets the stage for the U.S. Supreme Court to
decide how far states can go in helping to relieve the suffering of
terminally ill patients.</TE>
<TE>   "This [law] enables them to choose to cross the threshold of death in
a manner that's consistent with their most deeply held values. That, your
honor, serves the public interest," argued Kathryn Tucker, legal director
for Compassion in Dying, an assisted-suicide advocacy group that has
joined the Oregon Department of Justice in the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   But lawyers for the federal government cited a long medical tradition
against physician-aided suicide, including the opposition of the American
Medical Assn. They said suicide cannot be construed as a "legitimate
medical purpose" under the 32-year-old federal law that governs drugs
that have the potential for abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not about wholesale federalizing of the practice of medicine.
It is about federal regulation of the dispensation of medicines, and that
is an area in which the federal government has operated for 85 years,"
Deputy Assistant Atty. Gen. Gregory G. Katsas said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who has enjoined Ashcroft's ruling from taking effect until the
case has been decided, said he would rule in mid-April. He emphasized
that his ruling would look not at the constitutionality of assisted
suicide but at the federal government's application of federal drug laws
to the Oregon statute and the court's own jurisdiction in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Still, proponents of assisted suicide made it clear that they view the
Oregon statute as an answer to the U.S. Supreme Court's implicit
invitation to individual states to draft assisted-suicide legislation,
issued in 1997 when the court ruled there was neither a constitutional
right to die nor necessarily a constitutional impediment to states
legalizing the practice.</TE>
<TE>   They argued vehemently that the contentious public policy issue of
assisted suicide should be decided by public debate and legislative
consensus, not by unilateral rulings on the part of the attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no evidence that Congress intended to delegate a policy
decision of this magnitude, this importance, to the attorney general,"
said Stephen K. Bushong, a trial attorney for the Oregon Department of
Justice, which brought the lawsuit. Congress twice in recent years failed
to pass laws that would have outlawed physician-assisted suicide, the
plaintiffs noted.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Justice Department questioned Jones' authority to decide the
case, noting that appeals under the Controlled Substances Act are
supposed to be filed directly with a federal appeals court. In any case,
federal lawyers said, there is substantial case law setting the federal
government's authority to regulate controlled drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Though the regulation of medicine normally is within the purview of
the states, the Controlled Substances Act specifically bars dispensation
of potentially abused drugs "except as authorized" by the statute,
placing regulatory authority squarely on the federal government's
shoulders, Katsas argued.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors repeatedly have been subject to federal prosecution for
inappropriately prescribing controlled drugs, and their arguments that
states have the authority to determine what is a "legitimate medical use"
have been roundly rejected by the appellate courts, Katsas said. "In 49
other states, we construe federal law to prohibit the use of controlled
substances for assisted suicide."</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of legal and medical organizations from around the country have
weighed in on the debate, filing friend-of-the-court briefs. Those who
support the state's position include the American Civil Liberties Union,
the California Medical Assn., the American Academy of Pain Management,
the American Geriatrics Society, the Coalition of Mental Health
Professionals and Gay Men's Health Crisis. Most support the right of
dying patients to seek death on their own terms.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government has been backed by the National Right to Life
Committee, Physicians for Compassionate Care and a coalition of disabled
rights groups, who argue that public policy should be focused on
relieving suffering for the terminally ill, not helping them to die.</TE>
<TE>   "What people need to know is, we don't need to be giving people
overdoses to take care of them," said Gregory Hamilton, a psychiatrist
and spokesman for the physicians' group.</TE>
<TE>   But some of the most eloquent arguments presented to the court were
not heard at all in Friday's hearing. They were the testimony of dozens
of terminally ill patients and their relatives who filed written
declarations with the court. Their testimony starkly rebutted arguments
that better pain management would alleviate the need for assisted
suicide.</TE>
<TE>   One woman told of her 25-year-old daughter, racked by the pain of bone
cancer, begging her mother to help her die.</TE>
<TE>   Several told of relatives who resorted to anything at hand to kill
themselves because they had no access to drugs. Leslie Ghan of Huntington
Beach told how her father, dying last year of emphysema, lighted a
charcoal grill in his room and died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Marcia
Angell, editor emeritus of the New England Journal of Medicine, told how
her 81-year-old father, dying of prostate cancer, shot himself in the
head.</TE>
<TE>   "If physician-assisted dying had been available to my father, as it is
to the people of Oregon," she wrote, "I have no doubt that he would have
chosen a less violent and lonely death."</TE>

<HD>In Kentucky, Disaster Rides the River</HD>
<DH>Appalachia: Laced with logging and mining sites, the area braces
for floods every time rain swells the Cumberland's banks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HARLAN, Ky.
</DL>
<LD>Bob Scott can read the river that runs by his door. He can tell by
its gurgle, by its shifting colors and ebb and flow what it wants to do.
The river, he says, has a mood, like a person, and if you're a mountain
man, you can pretty much tell on any given day whether the river means
you harm or intends to pass you by.</LD>
<LD>   As the rain pounded down early this week and the muddied Clover Fork
rose, rushing past to join the headwaters of the Cumberland River behind
the Dairy Queen in Harlan, a few miles away, Scott discerned no threat.
He had seen the river angrier, in the floods of 1964 and '77 and '82, so
he and his mother restocked the shelves of their Yo Yo Market and waited
for the rain to stop and the river to recede.</LD>
<LD>   "This time I misread it," Scott, 46, said Friday, surveying the ruins
of his market and the five trailer homes he rents out. "I'd never seen
the Clover Fork come up so quick. In 30 minutes, the water was ankle
deep, in an hour, knee-deep. It kept going from there."</LD>
<TE>   Harlan County dump trucks already had hauled away five loads of
destroyed food stuffs and furniture from the building. Scott stepped
aside to make room for a bulldozer pulling a refrigerator out the door.
His eyes filled with tears when he looked inside the slime-caked
apartment he had built for his mother at one end of the market. There was
nothing but memories to salvage.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost $200,000 here, easy," he said. "But it's not just the money.
It's having everything torn away from you, knowing you got to start over.
At least that's something we're good at in the mountain hollows--starting
over. We've had practice."</TE>
<TE>Hillbilly Life Not for the Timid</TE>
<TE>   The flood of 2002 was bad--some say the worst in 25 years--but it
doesn't rank among the gravest to strike the coal mining towns of
Appalachia, where disaster and poverty are the companions of a stoic
people. "You have to be tough to be a coal miner and hillbilly," one
miner said. "And proud too. You go on." And, like the Scotts, start over.
Again.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Virginia took the brunt of the
storm, which dropped 5 inches of rain on Harlan County in 36 hours. Seven
people died in the four-state area, including three in a traffic accident
that Tennessee authorities blamed on the rain. Nearly 1,000 homes were
damaged or destroyed, and scores of bridges were washed out.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky Gov. Paul E. Patton and Virginia Gov. Mark Warner have asked
President Bush to declare parts of their states disaster areas. Federal
teams have been sent to determine what assistance is needed, and local
church and civic organizations have dispatched crews of volunteers to
help families clean up their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Like much of Appalachia, the little communities around Harlan in
southeast Kentucky flirt with disaster every time there is a hard rain.
The mountains, laced with coal seams and logging and mining sites, send
torrents of water gushing into the hollows and valleys where people live.
The streams and rivers overflow their banks, and the sludge- and
branch-laden waters tear through the hamlets like bulldozers.</TE>
<TE>   "Course there's no way I could prove this," said Burl Fee, the mayor
of Evarts, "but you have to think logging and strip mining has a big
effect on making the damage we see in this storm.</TE>
<TE>   "Look around you. They've logged these mountains bare. They'll tear up
10 or 12 trees to get one good oak or poplar. There's nothing left to
hold the water back. These are poor people to begin with, and they're
left poorer. I did a survey a while back, and of the 1,300 people in
town, 293 are living on fixed incomes of $500 a month or less."</TE>
<TE>   The Army Corps of Engineers has been working for a decade on a flood
control project to harness the Cumberland River, which flows from Harlan
to Nashville. Concrete barrier walls have been built, tributaries
diverted, floodgates and culverts constructed, pumps installed.</TE>
<TE>   "We started pumping at the station at 2 a.m. the morning after the
rains started," said Nick Rouse, Harlan County's flood plains
coordinator. "They worked perfectly. If it wasn't for the pumps, the
damage would have been much greater. I can guarantee you, Harlan city
would have been flooded without the pumps."</TE>
<TE>   The force of the flood waters that ripped chest-high through Tana
Dillman's mobile home tore her bathtub from the floor. It emptied her
closets and cabinets, leaving packages of bacon and macaroni, shoes and
shirts and her three children's toys buried in 6 inches of mud. About all
she managed to escape with were some family pictures and clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "I came back at dawn and cried when I saw what was left," she said. "I
was saving up to buy the trailer, but I can't move back now. Not with
that odor. Not with the mud. But I'm feeling better today. We moved in
with family. The kids are safe. We only lost a home, and you can replace
that."</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An outbreak of mysterious rashes among schoolchildren continued
this week, with about 60 youngsters in Philadelphia sent home with itchy,
pink blotches.</LD>
<LD>   The rashes on the students' arms and necks surfaced nearly two months
after hundreds of students in the area complained of similar rashes.
Since October, 14 states have reported outbreaks of unexplained rashes
affecting 10 to 600 people at a time.</LD>
<LD>   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta found no
common cause for the outbreaks.</LD>
<TE>   About 34 students at Mast Community Charter School in northeast
Philadelphia reported the rash Wednesday and were sent home. An
additional 26 were sent home Thursday, said Karen Delguercio, president
of the school's board of trustees.</TE>

<HD>Patient Gets 4th Kidney After Transplant Falters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Bergan County assistant prosecutor who already has three kidneys
in his body received a fourth when he underwent his second transplant.</LD>
<LD>   Ike Gavzy, 48, suffers from benign familial hematuria, a hereditary
disease that slowly eroded his own kidneys' ability to function. When the
kidneys he was born with began to falter in the early 1980s, he received
a third kidney from his father.</LD>
<LD>   Since Gavzy's own kidneys were not doing any harm, doctors left them
and added the third.</LD>
<TE>   Since that donated kidney was functioning at barely 15% capacity, he
received a cousin's kidney.</TE>
<TE>   A doctor said Gavzy could be back home Tuesday and may be able to
return to work in about a month.</TE>

<HD>Man Kills 4 Co-Workers at Plant, Then Himself</HD>
<DH>Crime: The gunman ended his life during a chase with police that
began in Indiana and concluded in Michigan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SOUTH BEND, Ind.
</DL>
<LD>A man fatally shot four co-workers at an aircraft parts plant
Friday, then fired at police from a stolen company van during a
high-speed chase that ended with him killing himself.</LD>
<LD>   The van was still moving when the gunman shot himself while
approaching a roadblock across the state line near Niles, Mich., said
Capt. Richard Dragomer of the Michigan State Police. The van ran over
some mailboxes and stopped when it hit a tree.</LD>
<LD>   The gunman was identified by police as William Lockey, 54. Police said
they weren't sure of a motive, though one co-worker said the man was
worried about losing his job.</LD>
<TE>   Two other employees were wounded in the shooting, and three officers
were hurt by flying debris or shotgun pellets as they exchanged gunfire
with Lockey during the chase. Police said Lockey stopped occasionally to
fire at police and reload before driving off again.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a gun battle all the way out of South Bend," Dragomer said.
"He was shooting all the way."</TE>
<TE>   Police said the shooting began about 8:15 a.m. CST at Bertrand
Products, a manufacturer with about 50 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Employee Sharon Zalas said the gunman carried a grocery bag at the
start of his 7 a.m. shift.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody went to work. The next thing we heard was pop, pop," Zalas
said. "We thought maybe it was one of the machines, because we saw one of
the guys running. Then we saw the gun, and he was shooting and shooting
and shooting."</TE>
<TE>   Zalas said she believed the gunman, who worked in the shipping and
receiving department and opened fire during a meeting, was targeting
particular co-workers.</TE>
<TE>   "Because he used to get in little squabbles with them because he
didn't get his merchandise in time to ship it out," Zalas said. "He was
sort of rigid, kind of a lone wolf. He was afraid of losing his job."</TE>
<TE>   The dead were identified as Craig Schafer, 50; John Contadeluci, 47;
Dave Arpasi, 73; and Robert Downs Jr., 42.</TE>
<TE>   A Michigan law enforcement officer was treated for a cut from a
windshield that was shattered by a gunshot, and two Indiana officers were
also injured during the van chase.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't just police officers he was shooting at," Dragomer said.
"There were construction workers heading for cover as the van was coming
through."</TE>
<TE>   One of the wounded plant employees was hospitalized in serious
condition. The other hospitalized worker was listed as stable.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>Army Secretary Thomas E. White and his wife flew to Colorado on an
Army jet this month and closed on the sale of their Aspen house,
according to Army officials and sources in Colorado.</LD>
<LD>   Army spokesman Larry Gottardi acknowledged that the Whites made the
Aspen trip while the Army secretary was traveling on business to Seattle.
He declined to explain the official purpose of the Seattle trip or what
Army business White had in Aspen.</LD>
<LD>   White and his wife, Susan, arrived in Colorado on March 1, Gottardi
said. On March 4, they signed papers for the sale of the Aspen house for
$6.5 million, according to Bill Sterling, the real estate agent who
handled the deal. White, who was an Enron Corp. executive for 11 years
before he was appointed Army secretary last spring, and his wife are also
trying to sell a town house at the ski resort.</LD>
<TE>   Under a policy outlined in a 1997 Department of Defense directive,
"the use of DoD transportation resources is limited to official DoD
requirements." The rule excludes family members from such trips.</TE>

<HD>Smelter Owner to Buy Out 160 Homes in Missouri Town</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS
</DL>
<LD>The owner of the nation's largest lead smelter will offer buyouts
to about 160 homeowners in the small town of Herculaneum, where tests
show many children have elevated levels of lead in their blood.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement with the Doe Run Co., reached Thursday with state
officials, adds to the government-mandated cleanup already underway in
the town south of St. Louis, where the company's smelter is the major
employer.</LD>
<LD>   It's the largest home buyout in the state forced by environmental
contamination since the Environmental Protection Agency closed down the
nearby town of Times Beach in 1982 because of dioxin contamination.</LD>
<TE>   "There is still a long way to go in Herculaneum," Gov. Bob Holden said
Friday. "However, yesterday we took a huge step forward."</TE>
<TE>   The agreement requires Doe Run to immediately offer to buy the homes
of residents with children younger than 6 who live nearest the smelter
and slag pile. The company, over the next 2 1/2 years, also will offer
buyouts to all residents within a slightly wider area.</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Health and Senior Services released a study
last month that found elevated lead levels in the blood of 28% of
Herculaneum children.</TE>
<TE>   A follow-up report released Tuesday showed that more than half the
children living within a half-mile of the smelter have elevated levels of
lead in their blood, which can affect intelligence and cause health
problems.</TE>
<TE>   The company will meet with residents to discuss the buyout; a date has
not been set.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad they thought enough of the children to get them out of this
mess," Dennis Shore, who lives about two blocks from the smelter, told
the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. A recent blood test showed his 3-year-old
granddaughter, Madison, had lead levels nearly twice the federal standard
for lead poisoning.</TE>

<HD>To Fight Kids' Obesity, Texas Returns to Gym</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AUSTIN, Texas
</DL>
<LD>Texas reinstated mandatory physical education in elementary schools
Friday, seven years after it was phased out to allow more time for
academics.</LD>
<LD>   Elementary school students will have to take at least 135 minutes of
gym every week under a rule approved, 13 to 2, by the Texas Board of
Education to combat obesity in children.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a childhood obesity problem in the state of Texas that needs
to be addressed," state Health Commissioner Eduardo Sanchez said. "One of
the places where it might be appropriate for children to get their
physical activity is in school. Get them little and it becomes a healthy
habit."</LD>
<TE>   Physical education was phased out in Texas elementary schools in 1995,
when the Legislature decided to put more emphasis on academic subjects.</TE>
<TE>   Texas high school students are already required to take gym to
graduate, and a small number of elementary schools elected to continue
it. But a new state law put gym back in the elementary school curriculum
and directed the board of education to come up with a plan to implement
it.</TE>
<TE>   "Physical education is going to make you learn better, retain what you
learn and make better grades, be able to stay in school and be
successful," said board member Geraldine Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Dissenting board member Alma Allen said the requirement will burden
teachers and cut instruction time for academics.</TE>
<TE>   "If he got his physical education, he could be healthy and dumb, and
we don't want that," Allen said.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-five percent of U.S. schoolchildren do not attend any physical
education class, said Anne Flannery, executive director of P.E.4Life, a
nonprofit organization that promotes physical education for youngsters.</TE>

<HD>Disputes Over Steel, Lumber Escalate</HD>
<DH>Trade: As Europe retaliates with a list of tariff targets, the U.S.
imposes punitive duties on Canadian softwood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Two high-stakes trade disputes escalated Friday as Europe prepared
a hit list of American products to retaliate for U.S. tariffs on steel,
and the United States slapped punitive duties on Canadian softwood
lumber.</LD>
<LD>   The European Commission confirmed that it was circulating a list of
tariff targets said to include products specifically chosen to inflict
pain in areas considered important to President Bush and congressional
Republicans in the 2002 elections.</LD>
<LD>   Although the contents were not made public, commission sources said
they included orange juice from Florida, steel from Pennsylvania and West
Virginia, textiles from the Carolinas and even motorcycles made by
Wisconsin-based Harley-Davidson Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Trade officials said the actions fall short of an all-out trade war.
Even so, they are certain to strain relations between the United States
and its biggest trading partners until the World Trade Organization can
rule. Last year, the European Union and Canada each accounted for about
one-fifth of U.S. exports and imports.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you have two elephants wrestling in the living room,
furniture gets broken," said one trade official, who requested anonymity.
He was referring to the U.S.-Europe steel dispute, but the observation
could be applied to the U.S.-Canada lumber flap as well.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials, though eager to explain the rationale behind the hefty
tariffs on Canadian wood, declined to discuss Europe's retaliatory moves.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of hard for us to comment on a list that we haven't even
seen," one said.</TE>
<TE>   Trade officials and experts on both sides of the Atlantic insisted
that the moves would not trigger a potentially devastating global trade
war. But they acknowledged that efforts to reach negotiated settlements
had proved unsuccessful--and that more skirmishing was likely.</TE>
<TE>   "The Europeans have much more to lose in a trade war than we do," said
Peter Morici, a University of Maryland business professor and former
International Trade Commission chief economist. "What I expect to happen
is for them to rattle the sabers but to go the WTO dispute-settlement
route, and that is not a trade war."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. steel protections, which include tariffs of up to 30%, have
been challenged by Europe, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, Norway,
Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. The WTO is unlikely to rule on the
issue until sometime later this year.</TE>
<TE>   European Commission spokesman Anthony Gooch told reporters that the
proposed target list had been distributed to member nations for
consideration and might be modified before it is forwarded to the WTO on
or before May 20.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to orange juice, steel, textiles and motorcycles, an
unidentified EU official told Reuters, the list included U.S. rice, paper
products, prefabricated buildings and thermometers.</TE>
<TE>   EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy, in an interview published Friday by
the Wall Street Journal, said he had deliberately targeted products and
regions he considered politically important to Bush. He expressed hope
that the threatened "countermeasures" would help persuade the United
States to lower its steel trade barriers.</TE>
<TE>   European officials noted that the United States has used similar
tactics in past trade disputes. In one case, it threatened to sanction
cashmere sweaters made in Scotland in retaliation for European
restrictions on bananas.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not only retaliation, it's emulation," said Gary Clyde Hufbauer,
senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics and a former
U.S. trade official. "They're doing what we would do in their position,
so in that sense, it's definitely playing fair."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. tariffs on Canadian lumber are the latest move in a
long-running dispute over cross-border trade in softwood products used
primarily as framing material in the construction of new homes.</TE>
<TE>   The Commerce Department said it would impose tariffs averaging 29% to
offset the effect of subsidies provided by Canadian provincial
governments and sales of Canadian wood in U.S. markets at prices below
the cost of production, a practice known as dumping.</TE>
<TE>   The tariffs would take effect after an expected May ruling by the
International Trade Commission that the U.S. lumber industry has been
hurt by underpriced Canadian wood.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's action was praised by U.S. wood producers, who accused Canada
of propping up a "Soviet-style" lumber industry. But it drew criticism
from wood consumers, who said it could boost the cost of a typical new
home by as much as $1,500. Wood producers disputed the estimate, saying
the increase would amount to no more than $200 or so.</TE>

<HD>Democrats Release Another Blockbuster</HD>
<DH>Politics: Hollywood producer Steve Bing gave the party $5 million
as donation restrictions draw near.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Los Angeles film producer Steve Bing has given $5 million to the
Democratic National Committee, top party officials said Friday,
confirming a second multimillion-dollar gift by an entertainment industry
figure that would be prohibited under a campaign reform about to become
law.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosure of Bing's donation came a day after the party announced
that Hollywood mogul Haim Saban of Los Angeles had given a
record-breaking sum of $7 million. Both contributions are to help pay for
a new party office building in Washington, expected to cost $32 million.</LD>
<LD>   The gifts, which Democrats said were far larger than any previous
contribution to the party, are also thought to exceed anything given to
Republicans on a national level.</LD>
<TE>   The Bing donation, first reported Friday by the New York Times, was
confirmed by Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe. In a
prepared statement, McAuliffe said he was "extremely grateful" for the
support the committee had received from major donors to finance a
$32-million project that the party hopes will help with fund-raising and
outreach for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   Bing's office declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Bing, 36, is the scion of a wealthy Los Angeles family that has given
major donations to Stanford University and the Los Angeles County Museum
of Art.</TE>
<TE>   He has been an increasingly active Democratic donor in recent years.
Bing gave more than $700,000 during the 1999-2000 campaign to help
Democratic candidates for president and Congress, according to federal
election data kept by the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Bing has worked as a writer, director and producer, but his greatest
success has come as a writer of comedies. He co-wrote the upcoming Jerry
Bruckheimer comedy "Down and Under," about a pair of childhood friends
who are charged with taking mob money to Australia but lose it to a
kangaroo.</TE>
<TE>   He also wrote or co-wrote "You Need Therapy" and "Why Men Shouldn't
Marry," both in development at major studios.</TE>
<TE>   His first break in Hollywood came as a co-writer of the 1980s Chuck
Norris films "Missing in Action" and "Missing in Action 2."</TE>
<TE>   He directed a straight-to-video erotic thriller, "Every Breath," and
produced the upcoming independent films "Without Charlie" and "Night at
the Golden Eagle." He served as executive producer for the recent
Sylvester Stallone film "Get Carter."</TE>
<TE>   Bing may be better known, however, for his relationship with actress
Elizabeth Hurley, who has claimed that Bing is the father of her
soon-to-be-born child.</TE>
<TE>   Bing has publicly questioned this assertion, issuing a statement that
their relationship wasn't "exclusive." This has made Bing a staple of the
British tabloids for the last several months. One, the Mirror, went so
far as to dub him "Bing Laden" on a front-page wanted poster and
published his office phone number so readers could voice their opinions
about the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Bing has since sued the Mirror and the Daily Mail for libel.</TE>
<TE>   The donations by Bing and Saban came to light in the same week that a
hotly debated campaign finance bill limiting large donations to the
parties won final congressional approval.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the biggest campaign contributions that I've ever heard of,
by multiples of three or four times," said Fred Wertheimer, a longtime
lobbyist for campaign contribution limits in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   He called donations of such magnitude "very dangerous to the political
system," contending that they make politicians too dependent on big-money
donors. Critics of contribution limits reply that donors are simply
exercising their constitutional rights to free speech and political
participation.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, the largest known donation to either of the major national
parties was a $1.7-million gift in 1994 from Amway Corp. to a Republican
committee.</TE>
<TE>   Under the campaign finance bill, which President Bush has pledged to
sign, an individual donor could give a national party committee no more
than $25,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   The law would not take effect until after November's elections,
meaning the parties could continue to solicit large contributions until
then.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Saban and Bing donations appear unprecedented for the
national parties, they are not groundbreaking when compared with
political contributions at the state level.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians reported giving
$15.9 million in 1998 to the campaign to pass a gaming initiative, state
disclosure records show. In the same year, Philip Morris Cos. Inc. gave
$7.9 million to a campaign opposing a California tobacco tax.</TE>

<HD>Delta Terminal at La Guardia Is Evacuated</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>The Delta Airlines terminal at La Guardia Airport was evacuated for
90 minutes Friday because of a security breach, inconveniencing hundreds
of travelers, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Aircraft that had left the terminal and taxied out to runways were
ordered back to the terminal, said Federal Aviation Administration
spokesman Jim Peters. He said the evacuation began at 10 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   An official for an airline, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
passenger on a stretcher had passed through a security checkpoint, but
two medical workers accompanying the patient were not screened. When
authorities learned of this, the official said, they ordered the terminal
evacuated.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which
operates the airport, referred questions to the FAA.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Delta flights, the terminal also services Northwest
Airlines passengers.</TE>
<TE>   A Delta spokeswoman said 13 flights, including seven commuter flights,
and about 1,400 passengers were affected by the evacuation. Two Northwest
flights, involving about 300 passengers, were also affected, a spokesman
said.</TE>

<HD>Stamp Price to Rise, but Post Office Still Sinking</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The cost of a first-class stamp will rise to 37 cents this summer,
a federal rate-setting agency ruled Friday, but the Postal Service is
widely expected to spiral into deeper debt even with the added cash.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-cent increase--the largest in a decade--was approved by the
Postal Rate Commission after an unusual consultation among the post
office, bulk mailers and unions that was itself seen as a sign of the
urgency of the mail service's financial problems.</LD>
<LD>   The higher rates are expected to go into effect June 30. But they are
expected to gain only "breathing room" for the postal service, said
commission chairman George A. Omas, and perhaps a year of stable postal
costs for businesses that rely on bulk mail service to reach far-flung
customers.</LD>
<TE>   The $70-billion entity with 900,000 employees and more than 38,000
local branches was hemorrhaging money even before last fall's deadly
anthrax cases. The attacks forced officials to spend more on safety and
security. It also accelerated the post office's most serious long-term
dilemma: the failure of mail volume to grow fast enough to cover costs.</TE>
<TE>   "Although [the Postal Service] is mandated to break even over time, it
is not generating sufficient revenues to cover both its operating
expenses and capital needs," congressional auditors said in a report
earlier this week. Its "financial outlook is becoming increasingly dire."</TE>
<TE>   The rate increase will not be enough for the post office to break even
and may make things worse by creating an incentive for some bulk mailers
to seek cheaper alternatives, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the commission-approved increase in the price of
first-class stamps, the cost of most other services will also rise.
Postcards will go up by 2 cents, to 23 cents. Priority mail will go up 35
cents, to $3.85 per pound. The cost to utilities of mailing bills will
rise 2.3 cents, and a bank statement will go up 3 cents. Money orders up
to $500 will cost the same amount, 90 cents.</TE>
<TE>   "The rate change is not going to solve the problem," said Leslie
Paige, a spokeswoman for Citizens Against Government Waste, which favors
letting private entities compete with the post office. "It's time for
Congress to step up to the plate and reform the system."</TE>
<TE>   Postal service spokesman Mark Saunders said the agency is preparing a
reorganization plan for Congress, to be issued next month.</TE>
<TE>   Congress considered various reforms during the 1990s but failed to
pass any, a testament to thorny politics that involve powerful postal
unions and business lobbies. The stakes are huge: The mailing industry
employs an estimated 9 million people and accounts for 8% of the nation's
gross domestic product. Lawmakers are reluctant to jump into the fray.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal is for [Postal Service officials] to work this out on their
own and change their business plan," said a congressional aide to a
lawmaker involved in the debate. "They are so far behind the eight ball
that this rate increase isn't going to make that much of a difference in
covering their deficit. They had filed for this before the anthrax
cases."</TE>
<TE>   The Postal Service deficit jumped more than eightfold from 2000 to
2001, rising to $1.68 billion from $199 million. Even before the anthrax
cases, the post office was projecting a $1.35-billion deficit for 2002.
It subsequently asked Congress for more than $5 billion to cover cleanup
costs and safeguards against contamination.</TE>
<TE>   Only $675 million has been set aside. The Postal Service covers its
deficits by borrowing from the U.S. Treasury, a debt that now exceeds $11
billion.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, I don't think anybody has a good handle on how bad
things are," said Postal Rate Commission spokesman Steve Sharfman.</TE>
<TE>   The American Postal Workers Union, which represents workers who sort
mail, was a notable exception to the consensus. The union objects to
discounts offered to large mailers as an inducement to keep them using
the system, saying the discounts come at the expense of the general
public.</TE>

<HD>Former Dodger Accuses Priest of Molestation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT
</DL>
<LD>Former major league baseball player Tom Paciorek said he and three
of his brothers were molested when they were children by a priest who was
removed this week from another Michigan church.</LD>
<LD>   The brothers grew up outside Hamtramck on Detroit's east side and
attended Hamtramck St. Ladislaus, where Father Gerald Shirilla was a
teacher.</LD>
<LD>   Shirilla was removed Wednesday from St. Mary Catholic Church in
Alpena, Mich. He had accepted an assignment there in August without the
permission of Cardinal Adam Maida, said Ned McGrath, a spokesman for the
Archdiocese of Detroit.</LD>
<TE>   The archdiocese apologized Friday to all victims sexually abused by
Roman Catholic clergy.</TE>
<TE>   "Words fall woefully short when commenting on stories about the abuse
of minor children by clergy," McGrath said in a prepared statement. "What
we can reiterate--on behalf of Cardinal Maida and the Archdiocese of
Detroit--is a sincere apology for these grievous acts."</TE>
<TE>   Shirilla, 63, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. His
attorney, Michael Smith, told the Detroit Free Press that the priest has
done nothing that would make him unfit for ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Paciorek said he complained about Shirilla to the Detroit Archdiocese
in 1993 after another former student filed a lawsuit about the priest.</TE>
<TE>   Shirilla admitted in a deposition that he massaged boys' chests and
stomachs while he or they were in their underwear but denied any sexual
contact.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese placed Shirilla on administrative leave and barred him
from public ministry, but he was never charged and the lawsuit was
dismissed in 1999 because the statute of limitations had run out.</TE>
<TE>   Paciorek, 55, said he was surprised when he heard Shirilla had been
hired in Alpena.</TE>
<TE>   "I was molested by him for a period of four years," Paciorek said this
week in Kissimmee, Fla., where he is covering the Atlanta Braves training
camp for Fox Sports Net. "I would refer to them as attacks. I would say
there was at least a hundred of them."</TE>
<TE>   The former All-Star said he didn't tell anyone because no one would
have believed him.</TE>
<TE>   Paciorek, an outfielder and first baseman who played for six teams,
including the Los Angeles Dodgers, from 1970 to 1987, said he still
suffers emotionally.</TE>
<TE>   He and his brothers had kept the abuse secret, even from each other,
until the early 1980s, when Michael Paciorek, now 47, the fourth of five
boys in the family, started making comments about Shirilla.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Paciorek, now 51, the third of the five brothers, related
similar memories of abuse.</TE>

<HD>Archbishop's Letter on Sex Abuse to Be Read at Sunday Mass in
Denver</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>DENVER
</DL>
<LD>Archbishop Charles Chaput, a leading conservative in the Roman
Catholic Church, has written a letter to be read from pulpits on Palm
Sunday addressing the scandal of sexual abuse by priests, his office said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Greg Kail, spokesman for the archbishop, declined to discuss any
details in the letter that was being sent to 150 parishes in the Denver
area.</LD>
<LD>   The archdiocese sent a fax Wednesday to parishes in the 380,000-member
archdiocese telling priests the archbishop's letter is expected to
replace the homily, or sermon, at Sunday's Mass.</LD>
<TE>   The letter follows a meeting this week between Denver Dist. Atty. Bill
Ritter and church officials about reporting child abuse cases.</TE>
<TE>   Chaput addressed the issue in the archdiocese's newspaper, the Denver
Catholic Register, saying that sexual misconduct by lay employees or
clergymen was a "grave sin" and that church officials must act on
allegations quickly.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Pope John Paul II broke his silence, saying priests who
molest children carry out the worst form of evil.</TE>

<HD>Ortiz Is Pleased After Getting New Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>The Angels and pitcher Ramon Ortiz reconciled Friday, agreeing to a
multiyear contract that soothed the right-hander's bruised ego and
circumvented a potential distraction as the regular season
approaches.</LD>
<LD>   Ortiz, offended when the club unilaterally renewed his contract
earlier this month, was all smiles after he said he was guaranteed at
least $7.25 million for three years plus a club option, and as much
as $11.7 million over four years.</LD>
<LD>   The terms that are used depend on whether Ortiz--recently revealed
to be three years older than he claimed--is arbitration eligible
after this season. That cannot be determined now because of
service-time issues and baseball's ongoing collective bargaining
negotiations.</LD>
<TE>   Although Ortiz had a rough day on the field Friday in a 13-8 loss
to the Milwaukee Brewers at Diablo Stadium, the new contract softened
the disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, I'm happy," said Ortiz, pounded for 14 hits and six earned
runs in 51/3 innings. "I wanted a good contract to take care of my
family. This is a good contract."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are pleased Ortiz's mood has improved.</TE>
<TE>   "[Renewal day is] always the worst day of the year for us, and for
the players that get renewed too," General Manager Bill Stoneman
said. "But we kept on talking. He was interested in keeping on
talking and it resulted in a long-term deal."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz, paid $250,000 last season, was renewed at $270,000 after
going 13-11 with a 4.36 earned-run average in 32 starts last season.
Under both multiyear packages, Ortiz, who turns 29 today, said he
will make $950,000 this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels finally made it official, selecting left-hander Jarrod
Washburn as their opening-day starter.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia told Washburn of the assignment--March 31
against the Cleveland Indians at Edison Field--making a long-expected
move. Scioscia chose the third-year starter over 147-game winner
Kevin Appier and two-time All-Star Aaron Sele, indicating his
confidence in the potential ace.</TE>
<TE>   "Washburn certainly stepped up last year," Scioscia said. "Part of
it [starting the opener] is handling the festivities of opening day.
You're trying to push the ship away from the dock in a good way, and
Wash is the type of pitcher who could make that type of statement.
We're excited about it."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn, 27, was 11-10, including an eight-game winning streak,
with a 3.77 earned-run average last season. His ERA led the team and
ranked 13th in the American League, and he's admired in the clubhouse
for his competitiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Now, it's Washburn turn to deliver.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming into camp, I didn't think there was much of a chance,"
said Washburn, sidelined because of strep throat during last season's
opener. "I was very happy I was picked."</TE>
<TE>   Right-handers Appier and Sele follow Washburn, then it's
left-hander Scott Schoeneweis and Ortiz.</TE>
<TE>   "We like the balance of our rotation," Scioscia said. "We like the
balance of experience and our lefty-righty breakdown.... Hopefully
there won't be any reason to change it, but we can adjust from it if
we have to."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Brewers had 25 hits against five Angel pitchers.... Garret
Anderson had two homers and four runs batted in.... Troy Glaus hit
his fifth homer and second in as many days after sitting out five
games.</TE>

<HD>Watkins Is Interested in Angels</HD>
<DH>Baseball: His attempts to buy Twins stalled, Alabama
businessman trying to make deal for Disney's baseball team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Donald Watkins, the Alabama businessman whose attempt to purchase the
Minnesota Twins has stalled, is now pursuing the Angels.</LD>
<LD>   In the April edition of a newsletter published by Watkins, an
article says he "made his proposal to purchase another [Major League
Baseball] team in early March." The article does not identify the
team or detail the proposal, but two sources confirmed the Angels,
who are owned by the Walt Disney Co., are the team.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels have not sought permission to reveal confidential
financial documents to Watkins, a highly placed baseball source said
Friday, an indication that sale discussions are in a preliminary
phase. The newsletter article indicates Watkins has not withdrawn his
offer to buy the Twins and has not ruled out bidding on the Montreal
Expos if owners allow that team to be moved to Washington, D.C.</LD>
<TE>   Watkins declined to comment. Paul Pressler, the executive who
oversees the Angels and Mighty Ducks for Disney, said the company
would not comment on potential buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins, 53, hopes to become the first African American with sole
ownership of a major league team.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to see him buy a major league franchise, for a lot of
reasons," Commissioner Bud Selig said Friday. "I think it would be a
good thing for baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Disney valued the Angels at $300 million and the Ducks at $150
million during negotiations to sell both teams three years ago.
Watkins is not interested in buying the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   Disney nearly sold the Angels to Florida Marlin owner John Henry
last fall, before Henry joined the group that eventually won the
bidding for the Boston Red Sox. At one point, sources said, Disney
told major league officials the company would have accepted $250
million from Henry, and Watkins is believed to be prepared to offer a
similar amount.</TE>
<TE>   Questions about Watkins' wealth have dogged him. According to a
source, he privately lists his net worth at $1.5 billion, a figure he
has never publicly disputed, discussed or detailed in numerous
interviews. He is not included in the Forbes ranking of the 400
richest Americans, a list of those whose worth the magazine estimates
at $600 million or more. In its current issue, Forbes examined
Watkins' business interests in banking and energy and concluded "we
have reason to doubt the [$1.5-billion] number."</TE>

<LD>Putting the ball in the basket is hard enough without three 6-foot
post players flailing their arms in your face. That was the
predicament Playa del Rey St. Bernard faced against Kentfield Marin
Catholic on Friday in the state Division IV girls' basketball
championship.</LD>
<LD>   Guard Alexis Kendricks and her St. Bernard teammates either drove
against the taller players and had their shots altered or hoisted
errant three-pointers during a 66-48 loss before about 1,000 at Arco
Arena.</LD>
<LD>   The Vikings (23-8) shot 27.7% from the field, including 12.5%
during a fatal third quarter, as Marin Catholic outscored St.
Bernard, 36-20, in the second half in winning its first state title.</LD>
<TE>   Kendricks finished with 15 points after making five of 23 shots,
including only one of 11 from three-point range.</TE>
<TE>   "They took away our drives and it was hard for us to score," said
Kendricks, who fouled out with 2 minutes 30 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hard to get off a good shot."</TE>
<TE>   Marin Catholic's post players were led by 6-foot-3 Brooke Smith,
who scored 13 points, grabbed 11 rebounds and blocked four shots.
Nickie Warren, 6 feet 1, added 14 points and eight rebounds, and 6-0
Lauren Nestor had 10 points.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Adrienne Payne, who led the Wildcats with 15 points, hit a
jump shot in the lane just before the first-half buzzer to give Marin
Catholic (29-5) a 30-28 lead. The Wildcats opened the third quarter
on a 6-0 run to take a 36-28 advantage and never led by fewer than
five points again.</TE>
<TE>   St. Bernard's Shannon Clay (13 points, 10 rebounds) made three
three-pointers in the fourth quarter, but her teammates remained
cold.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of my shots were in and out," Kendricks said, "and I could
not get it going."</TE>

<HD>Lea's Last Basket Gives King the Crown, 53-52</HD>

<LD>Needing a last-minute basket to capture a state basketball title in
only its second season of varsity competition, Riverside King High
turned to its leader, who delivered with the cool confidence that has
characterized his ascension to stardom.</LD>
<LD>   Guard Marvin Lea elevated over the outstretched arms of 6-foot-9
David Chiotti for a five-foot basket with 30 seconds left to lift
King to a spine-tingling 53-52 victory over Mountain View St. Francis
on Friday night in the Division II boys' basketball championship
before about 3,000 at Arco Arena.</LD>
<LD>   "I hit the shot like I normally do," Lea quipped afterward. "We
knew if we kept fighting that we would do it."</LD>
<TE>   Lea's shot capped a remarkable comeback from a 10-point deficit
late in the third quarter, as King became the first team from
Riverside County to win a state boys' basketball title.</TE>
<TE>   St. Francis had chances to win on its final two possessions. But
guard Hakeem Gilliard was called for a five-second violation while
being shadowed by Lea and guard John Montgomery's last-second jumper
bounced off the backboard.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys refuse to lose," said King Coach Tim Sweeney Jr. "I
think what got us by was their character."</TE>
<TE>   Statistically, Lea and Leon Rosborough led the way as usual. Lea
scored 23 points and Rosborough had 13 points and 13 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, King's other starters were also instrumental Friday. Garrett
Hilt contributed with outstanding defense against an opponent five
inches taller. Matt Thomas showcased his outstanding leaping ability
while grabbing eight rebounds. And James Ellis hit a three-pointer
late in the third quarter to get the Wolves going.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just heart," Hilt said when asked to explain what led to the
dramatic turnaround. "You can just feel it on the court."</TE>
<TE>   Lea started King's decisive 14-0 push with less than a minute to
play in the third quarter on a three-pointer and a jumper off a steal
to pull the Wolves to within 44-39.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas made a driving layup to give King a 45-44 lead. Rosborough
then made a three-pointer as the Wolves took a four-point edge. St.
Francis, which lost in the title game last year, went back ahead,
52-51, with 41 seconds left on a Chiotti free throw, setting the
stage for Lea.</TE>

<HD>Redondo Comes Up Short, 51-47</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>It was the cruelest of endings for Ofa Tulikihihifo and Redondo Union
High.</LD>
<LD>   One moment, Tulikihihifo was barreling down the lane, scoring a
basket that appeared to give the Sea Hawks a five-point lead late in
the game. The next, she was walking back up the court in disbelief
after a charging call wiped out the points.</LD>
<LD>   Undaunted, Tulikihihifo attacked the basket again, moving briskly
through the lane to attempt a go-ahead basket with 40 seconds left.
Then a whistle blew--another charging violation.</LD>
<TE>   That was the way it went for Redondo down the stretch of a 51-47
loss to Stockton St. Mary's on Friday in the state Division II girls'
basketball championship before about 3,000 at Arco Arena.</TE>
<TE>   "The first [call] could have went both ways, but the second ... I
don't know," Tulikihihifo said. "It was really hard, but you can't
argue with the refs. You just have to keep your composure and get on
with the game."</TE>
<TE>   Getting on with the game was exactly the problem for Redondo,
making its first appearance in a state championship game. After
Tulikihihifo was called for the second charge, with the score tied,
47-47, the Sea Hawks failed to score again.</TE>
<TE>   St. Mary's guard Dominique Banks made a short baseline jumper to
put the Rams ahead, 49-47.</TE>
<TE>   After Redondo's Tyler Martinook missed the front end of a one and
one with 10 seconds left, Renee Roberts made two free throws for St.
Mary's with five seconds to go for the final margin.</TE>
<TE>   Banks, a junior, scored 19 of her game-high 24 points in the
second half for the Rams (33-3), who won their second state title and
first since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Allison Bretana and Krisztina Fuleki scored 11 points each and
Tulikihihifo had 10 for Redondo (26-8).</TE>

<HD>Booker Happy With Choice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Life has settled down for Lorenzo Booker in the weeks since he
announced he would be playing football for Florida State next fall.</LD>
<LD>   No more late-night calls from recruiters. No more questions about
where he will go. And no more of the indecision that had him changing
his mind shortly before he appeared on national television to make
the announcement.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm so happy," the running back from Ventura St. Bonaventure High
said. "Even if I made the wrong decision, it's my decision. I can
look back and say I did what I really wanted to do."</LD>
<TE>   The happy ending notwithstanding, Booker and those close to him
say his story serves as a cautionary tale for any fan who thinks it
is glamorous to be a top-ranked recruit, or any athlete who longs to
be courted by every major college team in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   This is the flip side to the anxiety coaches feel, waiting for a
blue-chipper to decide.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fun for a while but it started getting to him," his
mother, Sharon Hill, recalled. "He didn't realize it would be so
intense."</TE>
<TE>   Booker had long been a Florida State fan, watching a videotape of
the Seminoles' victory over Virginia Tech in the 2000 Sugar Bowl more
times than he can recall. But as signing day approached, his decision
wasn't so simple.</TE>
<TE>   Recruiters called with 1,000 good reasons to pick their schools.
Some relatives and friends wanted him to stay close to home and
attend USC. Others favored Notre Dame, if only because Booker's
cousin works for an airline in Chicago and could help the family
visit nearby South Bend, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   The process shifted from flattering and exciting to increasingly
stressful. Booker awoke on signing day needing to make a choice. He
settled on Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   By early afternoon, reports of his decision leaked to Florida
State recruiting coordinator John Lilly, who sent his assistants
home, figuring they had done all they could do. Yet, half an hour
before Booker was to appear on ESPN, Lilly picked up the phone.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to give him a chance to tell me himself," Lilly said.
"So he could go on and we could go on."</TE>
<TE>   Booker had stopped taking calls but Lilly had a cell phone number
for Booker's cousin and hoped to pass along a message. He was
surprised when Booker answered and wanted to talk.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Lilly had become more of a friend then a coach," Booker
said. "I could talk to him for hours."With television waiting, Lilly
kept it short. He told the young man to go with his heart. If Florida
State was his choice, his family would find a way to visit, the coach
said. As they hung up, Lilly recalled, "I had the sense he wasn't
sure what he wanted.... I really felt sorry for him because the whole
thing had been so highly publicized and he was in a corner."</TE>
<TE>   Booker huddled with relatives and friends before delivering the
unexpected news that he was headed for Tallahassee, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, there were tears in his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "I was crying because I gave up my family, my girlfriend,
everything to go to Florida State," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, a content Booker figures the experience helped him mature.
And loved ones--even those who favored other schools--have been
supportive. Still, he has advice for players who follow in his
footsteps.</TE>
<TE>   "If you know where you want to go, commit early."</TE>

<LD>Sources late Friday said negotiations for a Lennox Lewis-Mike Tyson
fight at the Pyramid in Memphis, Tenn., were dead. Those rumors were
then denied by Pat English, a lawyer representing Lewis.</LD>
<LD>   Hours earlier, those involved in the negotiations had been
optimistic that a deal would be done this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   But only the day before that, a possible financing bank had
dropped out of the negotiations.</LD>
<TE>   And on it goes.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is a $12.5-million site fee, a hefty price for a
20,000-seat arena with the average ticket price to be set at $400.</TE>
<TE>   There were many issues to be dealt with before Lewis would agree
to defend his World Boxing Council and International Boxing
Federation titles against Tyson. There was the matter of pay,
resolved when each fighter was guaranteed a purse of $17.5 million.
There was the matter of broadcast rights, resolved when cable
networks HBO and Showtime--HBO tied to Lewis, Showtime to
Tyson--agreed to a third neutral pay-per-view outlet for the match.</TE>
<TE>   All that was left was the site. But that has proved to be the
biggest obstacle of all.</TE>
<TE>   It appeared earlier in the week that a Memphis deal was at hand,
with financing arranged through a Tennessee bank.</TE>
<TE>   But that deal collapsed when bank officials decided not to issue a
letter of credit, citing "moral issues." Tyson has served jail time
on rape and assault convictions.</TE>
<TE>   There have been a lot of false starts for a Lewis-Tyson fight
since serious negotiations began. Las Vegas' MGM Grand Hotel agreed
to the site fee, contingent, naturally, on Tyson's getting a boxing
license in Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Promoters for both sides, confident, had a New York press
conference in January to announce the fight.</TE>
<TE>   Bad idea. As his handlers should know all too well, putting Tyson
face to face with an opponent is like putting a pit bull face to face
with a lamb chop.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson initiated a brawl and, according to Lewis, bit him on the
thigh. Tyson himself was cut.</TE>
<TE>   The Nevada State Athletic Commission subsequently denied Tyson a
license, citing not the brawl but his failure to make good on his
promises to clean up his life after having bitten both of Evander
Holyfield's ears in their 1997 title match.</TE>
<TE>   The hunt was on for a new spot, a search that stretched from
Staples Center to the MCI Center in Washington to Detroit and
Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   It was assumed that, with the Las Vegas casino money out of play,
the promoters would have to lower their expectations of a $12-13
million site fee and their hopes of a $100-million match.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson was given a license in Washington, D.C., but the site fee
wasn't there.</TE>
<TE>   The promoters stuck to their figure, however, and hope to get it
from an investor group in Memphis this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pointing Fingers</TE>
<TE>   Dan Goossen, formerly a Tyson promoter, blames Shelly Finkel,
Tyson's manager, for the problems of the former two-time heavyweight
champion.</TE>
<TE>   "Shelly made one bad decision after another," Goossen said. "The
shame is that Mike has allowed it. The way Shelly has handled Mike's
career, Mike might as well be fighting at Wal-Mart.</TE>
<TE>   "If Shelly was a baseball manager who had started with the
Dodgers, he'd be coaching in Pocatello by now.</TE>
<TE>   "I actually think Mike was better off with [promoter] Don King.
Why he puts up with Shelly Finkel, I have never, ever understood."</TE>
<TE>   When Goossen worked with Tyson, Goossen and Finkel constantly
feuded over the course of the fighter's career.</TE>
<TE>   Finkel did not return a phone call seeking response to Goossen's
remarks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boiling Point</TE>
<TE>   Real or manufactured, the feuds between fighters are always
tempered enough to keep them on the same stages to promote their
matches even if sometimes barriers are needed to separate the
fighters.</TE>
<TE>   But the animosity between Oscar De La Hoya and Fernando Vargas,
who will fight in a welterweight title match May 4 at Las Vegas'
Mandalay Bay Events Center, has grown to the point where Vargas
doesn't even want to work with De La Hoya on the promotion.</TE>
<TE>   The fight between the Southern California rivals was entitled "Bad
Blood" even before they got into a shoving match at a Los Angeles
news conference.</TE>
<TE>   So Vargas will hold his own pep rally Sunday on Olvera Street in
the Pueblo de L.A. Plaza beginning at 2 p.m. The public is invited.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quick Jab</TE>
<TE>   Goossen, now operating Goossen Tutor Promotions, has a card April
7 at the Soboba Casino in San Jacinto, to be shown on "Fox Sunday
Night Fights."</TE>
<TE>   The main event features bantamweights Johnny Gonzalez (14-3, one
knockout) and Ricardo Vargas (31-9-3, 11) in a rematch of their Feb.
8 fight, won on a decision by Vargas.</TE>

<LD>For the first time in its 63-year history, the Baseball Hall of Fame
is taking its show on the road.</LD>
<LD>   The "Baseball As America" exhibition opened last weekend at the
American Museum of Natural History in New York for a six-month run
before moving to nine other cities, including Los Angeles, over the
next three years.</LD>
<LD>   Among the 500 artifacts in the show are the Doubleday ball used in
an 1839 game, a 1908 Thomas Edison recording of "Casey at the Bat,"
"Shoeless" Joe Jackson's shoes, Jackie Robinson's jersey and a hate
letter sent to Hank Aaron during his pursuit of Babe Ruth's home run
record.</LD>
<TE>   "It tells the story of baseball and how it helped shape American
culture," Aaron said at a preview.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition is a mini-version of the Hall of Fame in
Cooperstown, N.Y., and features film clips of famous game moments, a
progression of equipment, movie memorabilia and artwork.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the record for points scored in an NCAA
men's basketball championship game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   America's team: The New England Patriots' improbable Super Bowl
victory over the St. Louis Rams was a memorable sports moment, one
that football fans apparently can't get enough of.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Sabol, the head of NFL Films, told the Boston Globe that the
video of the Patriots' upset is already the greatest-selling sports
video of all time.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing before that compares to this," Sabol said. "This
video has already sold more than 500,000 copies. And before it's
over, with Father's Day coming up, the sales could go over 600,000,
which would double the sales of any other sports video in history."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Changed man: While in the minor leagues, Milton Bradley spit gum
at an umpire and served a seven-game suspension for starting a brawl,
earning a reputation as a troublemaker before coming to the Cleveland
Indians in a trade last July.</TE>
<TE>   But the 23-year-old Bradley, who is expected to replace Kenny
Lofton as the Indians' center fielder, says that's all in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I was before is not the way I am," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sage preparation: Most soccer fans traveling to South Korea for
the World Cup this summer probably won't make time to visit herbal
doctors. The herbalists are ready, though, just in case.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been training our doctors and nurses in English, Japanese
and Chinese since last March," said Lee Kyu Hoon, a manager at
KyungHee University Oriental Medicine Hospital. "The World Cup is a
great chance to promote what we do, and we don't want to miss out on
the opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Bill Walton of UCLA, 44, against Memphis in 1973.
Walton made 21 of 22 shots from the field, also a championship-game
record.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: With his mother at his side, former Olympic downhill
champion Bill Johnson on Friday skied down the slope where he
suffered near-fatal injuries during a nasty fall exactly one year
ago.</TE>
<TE>   After starting gingerly, Johnson soon was skiing all out through a
layer of fresh powder in Whitefish, Mont., leaving his mother, DB
Johnson, and a string of reporters in his tracks.</TE>
<TE>   "You're skiing very fast," DB Johnson told her son as she finally
caught up to him.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks," he answered. "You're skiing very slow."</TE>

<LD>Through eight seasons of good, bad and mediocre basketball, veteran
shooting guard Eric Piatkowski has seen a great deal of the Clippers.
He likes what he has seen recently of his current team best of all.</LD>
<LD>   "It's nice when you have everyone contributing," said Piatkowski,
one of five players to score 10 or more points in Thursday's 20-point
rout of the Golden State Warriors. "That's really nice. It's the way
it's been of late. We're going to need everyone to contribute night
in and night out. Teams are going to have their troubles defending
us."</LD>
<LD>   Piatkowski discounted the notion that a late-season rash of
injuries will kill the Clippers' playoff hopes in the final days. He
believes the team has grown stronger--rather than weaker--because of
injuries to forwards Corey Maggette and Lamar Odom and guard Keyon
Dooling.</LD>
<TE>   After all, the healthy Clippers have rallied around one another to
win seven of 10 games this month and draw within 11/2 games of a
playoff spot in the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   "We're limping around, but it's been like that all season,"
Piatkowski said. "I can't remember the last time we were at full
strength."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers practiced for 45 minutes Friday before calling it
quits.</TE>
<TE>   Quentin Richardson did not participate because of a sprained left
big toe. Tremaine Fowlkes got the day off to be with his newborn son
in Sacramento. Richardson and Fowlkes are expected to play tonight
against the Phoenix Suns. Darius Miles and Michael Olowokandi, who
have sore left knees, also will play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After tonight, the Clippers play their remaining 12 games in
pairs. They have six sets of games on consecutive nights, starting
Monday against the San Antonio Spurs at Staples Center and Tuesday
against the Kings at Sacramento. They will play six of their final 12
games at Staples, where they are 23-11.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>

<TE>   7:30, Fox Sports Net 2</TE>
<TE>   Site--Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KXTA (1150).</TE>
<TE>   Records--Clippers 36-33, Suns 30-38.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Suns--2-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--Another game, another deflated opponent. Two nights after
giving the Golden State Warriors their eighth consecutive loss, the
Clippers can do the same to the Suns. In addition, Phoenix, which put
Tom Gugliotta on the injured list this week because of a stress
fracture in his right foot, has lost nine of 11. A victory tonight
would give the Clippers their most victories since they were 41-41 in
1992-93. They were 36-46 in 1996-97, the last season in which they
qualified for the playoffs.</TE>

<HD>Dales Gets to Basket Sooner Than Most</HD>
<DH>Women: Versatile guard, a Canadian import, has it all
together for Oklahoma, which faces Texas Tech tonight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NORMAN, Okla.</DL>
<LD>Put a basketball in the hands of Stacey Dales and give her a
three-on-two fastbreak to lead. Then sit back and watch.</LD>
<LD>   The lean, 6-foot blond with pale blue eyes becomes a flash of
lightning, bolting her way down the center of the court, glancing at
streaking teammates on the wings, gauging who has the best chance to
finish off the play.</LD>
<LD>   Her pass may bounce through traffic. Or be whipped on a 45-degree
angle. It may be lofted toward the rim. Whatever she chooses, the
results are usually the same: an easy basket, a roaring crowd, a
deflated opponent, the cool smile of a successful leader.</LD>
<TE>   "I see everything. But I see gaps and angles more than anything,"
Dales said. "The bodies that I see are secondary to the spots I find.
I pick a spot; it's just a quick glance or eye contact with my
teammate. It might not even be that. But I feel their momentum and I
feel the gap. And I put the ball in that spot, based on those two
things."</TE>
<TE>   Dales, 22, isn't simply a two-time first-team All-American who has
led Oklahoma to a school-record 29 victories, the regular-season and
tournament Big 12 Conference titles, the top seeding in the NCAA
tournament's West Region, and tonight's West semifinal matchup
against Texas Tech in Boise, Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   On an average night Dales will score 17 points, dish out five
assists and pick off five rebounds. She can play three
positions--point guard, shooting guard and small forward. She is the
Big 12's all-time assist leader. Besides playing Division I, the
Collingwood, Ontario, native is a fixture on Canada's national and
Olympic teams.</TE>
<TE>   Her impact on the Sooner program is staggering. When she completes
her career, Dales will be listed in 17 career categories. She is the
only Oklahoma player with at least 1,800 points, 600 rebounds and 700
assists.</TE>
<TE>   "I take a lot of pride that I have become a very good basketball
player over the four years at Oklahoma, that I represent the
university, and I've been able to put Oklahoma on the national map,
to help give it a start," Dales said. "That means more than
anything."</TE>
<TE>   Basketball is her world, but not her universe. A communications
major who graduates in May, Dales cracks up teammates on trips by
performing skits she has seen on "Saturday Night Live."</TE>
<TE>   She and fiance Chris Schuman, who plan an April 13 wedding, enjoy
dancing and lavishing affection on their yellow Labradors, Allie and
Grace. Teammates say Dales is a pretty good cook.</TE>
<TE>   They also say they don't begrudge Dales the attention she receives
as the team's best-known player because they know she'd rather fit in
than stand out. Besides, Dales' passing ability gets everyone points
and keeps everyone in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great playing with her," said fellow senior and backcourt
partner LaNeishea Caufield, who, like others, praises Dales'
leadership abilities. "She doesn't yell at you; she'll pull you aside
and talk to you in huddles. If you get frustrated with the coaches
she will be the one who talks to you and brings a different
perspective, and you'll go 'Oh, I get it.'"</TE>
<TE>   When discussing the top collegiate guards available in the April
WNBA draft, some league scouts are as high on Dales as they are
Connecticut's Sue Bird, the Naismith player of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "Dales can play more positions," one Eastern Conference scout
said. "And Dales may be the top pick because of her international
experience."</TE>
<TE>   Dales may still have lessons to learn. But no one has to improve
her confidence. She has an unshakable faith that Oklahoma will not
only make the Final Four, but win the title.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a very special chemistry," Dales said, "and we're all
extremely goal-oriented individuals.... Combine all those minds and
you have a very disciplined, eager team."</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't always the case. Back in 1990, the Sooners were in
such disarray that university officials dropped women's basketball
during the Final Four weekend. It was reinstated eight days later
amid protests and allegations that the move violated Title IX.</TE>
<TE>   Two events revitalized the program. First, Sherri Coale was hired
as coach in 1996, even though she had no previous Division I
experience.The second was Coale convincing Dales, who was spotted
playing on a club team in Canada, to attend Oklahoma instead of
Syracuse. She was won over by Coale's belief that Dales could help
turn a sagging program into a great one.</TE>
<TE>   Dales redshirted her freshman year after tearing a ligament in her
left knee, and Oklahoma staggered through an 8-19 season. Since then,
Oklahoma has gone 97-31.</TE>
<TE>   Coale said Dale's offensive gifts were soon evident. While at
Oklahoma, her growth as a player has been as much mental as physical.</TE>
<TE>   "One, she's gotten tough," Coale said. "When she first came in
here she was really thin, had little muscle mass and didn't tolerate
pain. To be quite frank, [opponents] would muscle her out of the
game. And she had to figure out how to handle it.</TE>
<TE>   "Also, early in her career she was a very emotional player, and
she would use up all of her adrenaline in the first five minutes of
the game. She handles her emotions better and found that calm
intensity that makes her successful."</TE>
<TE>   Dales said she had no choice but to find that balance if she was
going to be successful.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything I do in life I do full out," she said. "It's all about
priorities, what is important in your life at that time. A lot of
people only get to do one of these things throughout their life, so
I'm really savoring them. I've got basketball, then I get married,
then graduate. Take it step by step, and you don't get too stressed."</TE>

<HD>He's Dancing Knight Away</HD>
<DH>South: It hasn't been easy for Davis, but with upset over
Duke and a good shot at the Final Four, he's establishing his own
tradition at Indiana.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LEXINGTON, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Indiana fans walk up to Mike Davis sometimes, hat in hand, and ask
for his autograph.</LD>
<LD>   The caps say Texas Tech.</LD>
<LD>   Davis fumes, but he signs.</LD>
<TE>   "I wonder if they realize the message they're sending to me," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Knight has been gone for two seasons, but the shadow he casts
over Indiana is still bigger than the man.</TE>
<TE>   When Davis leaped into the arms of guard Tom Coverdale after
Indiana's monumental upset of defending national champion Duke on
Thursday, it was the very image of catharsis.</TE>
<TE>   So often tormented by the pressure of succeeding Knight, Davis has
brought Indiana within a victory over Kent State in the NCAA South
Regional final today of the Hoosiers' first Final Four since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   In two weeks, Davis has won more NCAA games than Knight has in his
last seven tournaments, beating Utah, North Carolina Wilmington and
Duke to reach the Elite Eight. Knight, in his much-anticipated return
to the tournament with Texas Tech, went home after a first-round loss
to Southern Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   Whether that makes Davis a Hoosier hero, well, wait and see.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to know Indiana fans," forward Jared Jeffries said.
"No matter how many national titles you win, no matter how many Big
Ten titles you win, some people are going to stay loyal to Coach
Knight for various reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "But Coach Davis is building a tradition at Indiana, and this
team's building a tradition. I think people who were with us before,
loyally, are our biggest fans now. The people who are just now
jumping on, they'll jump back off if things get hard."</TE>
<TE>   Until these past few days, Davis often looked like a man who could
not handle the demons that come with following Knight.</TE>
<TE>   He cracked after a game last season, wondering out loud if he was
the right man to coach the Hoosiers.</TE>
<TE>   After a loss to Butler this season, he went on a tirade against
officials, saying, "If I wasn't the lowest-paid coach in the Big Ten,
I'd tell you how I really feel about this game." He proceeded to
anyway, and was fined $10,000 by the Big Ten--a penalty that perhaps
should have endeared him to the Knight fans who are so cool to him.</TE>
<TE>   Only in recent days has it seemed Knight's legacy is loosening its
grip.</TE>
<TE>   "The ghosts will never go away because what you have is people
who, I won't say are crazy, but, I don't know, there's no way to
describe it," Davis said. "I try to put those people out of my mind,
but it's very difficult sometimes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm growing as a coach. I'm growing every single game. The thing
I wasn't prepared for was the media part and being able to control my
emotions.</TE>
<TE>   "As a player, I played as hard as anyone, and as a coach, I try to
coach the same way. But you can't coach that way. You have to coach
the basketball team and not get caught up in everything else."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, a former stutterer, seems more and more at ease, bantering
with and courting rival Kentucky fans against Duke. A father who lost
a 1-year-old daughter from his first marriage in a car accident in
1990 now bounces his son, Antoine, 3, on his knee during interviews.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of Indiana people who love Indiana basketball.
They're the happiest people in the world right now because we played
well and we're doing well," he said. "Those are the ones I'm
concerned about--the ones who love Indiana basketball, because we
want to make them proud."</TE>
<TE>   The Hoosiers are doing that. Coincidentally, their biggest chance
yet comes today against the team that knocked them out in the first
round last year and raised questions about Davis' future.</TE>
<TE>   "There were two teams I didn't want to play, that was Texas Tech
and Kent State," he said. "They almost cost me my job last year."</TE>
<TE>   Davis served as interim coach after Knight's firing and was
awaiting word on whether he'd earned the job despite swirling Steve
Alford rumors when Indiana was upset by the Golden Flashes. Before
March was over, Davis had been awarded a four-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   Said guard Dane Fife: "You know, as a player, I had been around
Coach Davis for three years, and truthfully, in my mind and most of
my teammates' minds, we knew Coach Davis had the ability to coach, so
we were going to fight for him as we did for Coach Knight.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt he earned his spot as the Indiana head coach, and we
weren't going to let him lose it.... We knew he deserved it."</TE>
<TE>   No matter what Davis has done, it usually hasn't been enough.</TE>
<TE>   When Indiana blew a halftime lead and lost at Minnesota, a Knight
loyalist in Minneapolis said, "Well, that never would have happened
if Coach had been here."</TE>
<TE>   A share of the Big Ten title this season? Why not win it outright?</TE>
<TE>   The Sweet 16? Let's see you get to the Final Four.</TE>
<TE>   A Final Four? Knight won three titles.</TE>
<TE>   But that victory over Duke, that was a big one.</TE>
<TE>   "I think winning that game proved to some people that it's no
fluke," said Davis, who collapsed to his knees when Fife made his
ill-advised foul against Jason Williams on a made three-pointer with
four seconds left, a gaffe Indiana survived when Williams missed the
free throw.</TE>
<TE>   Fife said he would have been like Bill Buckner of the Boston Red
Sox--or worse--had Duke come back to win after he committed the foul
on Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was going to be like the guy in the World Cup, the
guy from Colombia," Fife said. "Or if we went to overtime and we were
to lose, how many hate e-mails am I going to get?"</TE>
<TE>   That's Indiana basketball. They never forget.</TE>
<TE>   That quality also has its good side.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Dane and [forward Jarrad Odle] that on my radio show, they
have trivia questions all the time, and there are people that answer
questions about 1955, about 1947," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, I played basketball at Alabama, and you ask them a
question about 2001 and they wouldn't know.</TE>
<TE>   "My point to them was that playing basketball at Indiana is a
great honor. If you do something special, the fans of Indiana will
remember you for the rest of your life. We made it to the Sweet 16,
but what memories will they have, what lifelong friends will they
have, if we went to the Final Four?"</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Bichette Retires After 14 Seasons</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Reserve outfielder Dante Bichette, convinced he would not be
effective in the pinch-hitting role the Dodgers envisioned, abruptly
announced his retirement Friday night, ending a distinguished 14-year
big league career that began with the Angels in 1988.</LD>
<LD>   Bichette, a career .299 hitter with 274 home runs and 1,141 runs
batted in, doubled in three at-bats in the Dodgers' 7-3 exhibition
victory over Montreal, coming within a few feet of a home run in the
sixth inning. He decided earlier Friday afternoon it would be his
last game.</LD>
<LD>   "I can still play; I think I could play until I'm 80," Bichette,
38, said. "But I remember talking to Paul Molitor, and Jim [Tracy,
Dodger manager] said it tonight--you retire because the preparation
and the focus aren't there. Those are the things I didn't have this
spring. I have no regrets. I'm really at peace with this."</LD>
<TE>   Bichette, expected to be the right-handed complement to
pinch-hitting specialist Dave Hansen, hadn't slept well for a week as
he pondered what to do. The four-time All-Star nearly walked out of
camp Wednesday but said Thursday he planned to honor his contract.</TE>
<TE>   "Then, at 1 p.m. [Friday] it hit me," said Bichette, who has a
wife (Mariana) and two sons, Dante, 9, and Bo, 4. "To be honest with
you, I broke down a bit. I prayed to Jesus to make me a strong man,
husband and father.... The family was calling me."</TE>
<TE>   If another team calls with a full-time job offer, Bichette would
consider it.</TE>
<TE>   "But I had the whole off-season to find that job, and it just
wasn't there," he said. "It's tough for me to say I'm retiring, but
if the door to being an every-day player is shut, I would be hurting
the team if I stuck around and my heart wasn't in it."</TE>
<TE>   Bichette hit .190 (8 for 42) with two homers, two doubles and four
RBIs in 16 spring games. He was considered a lock to make the team,
but now Mike Kinkade, Hiram Bocachica and Phil Hiatt will compete for
a pinch-hitting job.</TE>
<TE>   "There are players who had good careers, great careers and
brilliant careers, and to me, he's had a brilliant career," Tracy
said of Bichette. "Not a lot of players have accomplished what he
has, so I have to respect his decision. I'm disappointed I didn't
have him five years ago, and I wish I had those 500 at-bats for him."</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Dan Evans was surprised by Bichette's retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "After talking to him three times in the last three days, I
respect what he's doing," Evans said. "He's doing it for all the
right reasons."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There's an edginess to camp these days, an uneasiness that often
comes in the final week of spring training when jobs are still up in
the air and roles have not been clearly defined.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere is that more evident than in the rotation, where Odalis
Perez, Omar Daal and Eric Gagne have been battling for the fifth
spot. Perez appears to be the favorite, Daal is the most likely to be
traded, and Gagne appears headed to the bullpen, but right now,
uncertainty rules.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be good for management to make a decision, because we
need to know," Perez said. "It would be better for each of us to know
what's going on, so guys can get ready for their roles."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said Friday he is "very close to making a decision so guys
know their roles ... but not today."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne may have made one of those decisions for the Dodgers on
Friday night, throwing three innings of perfect relief, striking out
four. Gagne's fastball hit 97 mph in his first inning and hit 96 mph
consistently. He also showed a good slider and changeup.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne is tentatively scheduled to start a game Wednesday, but
Tracy said he would like to see him pitch a few more times in relief.
There is also speculation Gagne could evolve into the closer the
Dodgers lack.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got the stuff to do it and the mentality," catcher Chad
Kreuter said. "He's not afraid of anything. He has that hockey
mentality; he's going to stick his nose in and battle."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne said he doesn't care whether he starts or relieves, but he
admits the idea of closing intrigues him. He was the closer for the
Canadian national team in 1995, throwing 12 scoreless innings and
striking out 20 in 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be an adrenaline rush, I'd love it," Gagne said.</TE>
<TE>   And if he blew a save? "It might be easier to forget," he said.
"One of my big problems as a starter is I'd have four days to think
about what I should have done, what I did wrong, what I have to do
the next time. As a reliever, if you screw up, you have to get over
it and pitch the next day."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hideo Nomo gave up one run on four hits and struck out six in five
innings Friday night, throwing 79 pitches. Shawn Green, batting .094
this spring, hit a two-run homer to the opposite field in the first
inning.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Suffer Another Hard-Fought Defeat</HD>
<DH>Hockey: St. Louis' Mellanby scores late in the third period
to send Anaheim to 3-2 loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Scott Mellanby was looking for a "soft spot" and he found it near the
net.</LD>
<LD>   Mellanby scored late in the third period, lifting the St. Louis
Blues to a 3-2 victory Friday night over the Mighty Ducks.</LD>
<LD>   He scored the game-winning goal at 12:28, taking a pass in the
right circle from Pavol Demitra and lifting a shot over the glove
hand of Jean-Sebastien Giguere.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a great forecheck by [Keith] Tkachuk and Demitra, they
were both behind the net," Mellanby said. "I was just trying to find
a bit of a soft spot. I usually go to the top of the crease and just
kind of slosh and stuff. I tried to pull out a bit and find an area.
Pavol made a great pass."</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim's Mike Leclerc tied it, 2-2, at 6:11 of the third period,
scoring off an assist from German Titov. It was Leclerc's 19th goal.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a physical game," Duck Coach Bryan Murray said. "We had a
couple of chances after we tied it, but we don't score enough to keep
anyone on their heels."</TE>
<TE>   Trailing 2-0, the Ducks scored their first goal at 13:16 of the
second period when Paul Kariya scored his 30th.</TE>
<TE>   "We had it looking like we were on our way to a solid win there
when it was 2-0," St. Louis Coach Joel Quenneville said. "Then all of
a sudden, we were in a ballgame. I mean, that was a tough game. It
was a man's game tonight. There wasn't a lot of room out there. We
had to fight for everything. Obviously, that was a big goal at the
end there."</TE>
<TE>   After a scoreless first period, the Blues broke out to their 2-0
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Tkachuk scored his 30th goal only 17 seconds into the second
period for his first goal in four games since returning from an
injury that sidelined him for eight games after the Olympic break.</TE>
<TE>   Al MacInnis scored from the right circle at 10:17 to make it 2-0.
It was MacInnis' first goal since Jan. 17, a span of 20 games.</TE>

<HD>Huskies Take Care of Business</HD>
<DH>East: Upstart Southern Illinois stays close, but
Connecticut eventually pulls away to 71-59 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SYRACUSE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Leave it to mangle-a-minute talker Jim Calhoun to brilliantly sum up
Connecticut's 71-59 victory over Southern Illiniois and do a hack-job
on the English language.</LD>
<LD>   All in the same breath.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't have better players," the Connecticut coach said. "We
just have more better players. I know that's grammatically
incorrect."</LD>
<TE>   Calhoun gets paid to coach basketball, and he's more better than
most.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut's win Friday night at the Carrier Dome in the East
Regional semifinals vaulted the Huskies into Sunday's final against
Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 Connecticut (27-6) didn't do anything fancy to oust No. 11
Southern Illinois (28-8). The Huskies simply took care of business on
a night when it would have been easy to look ahead.</TE>
<TE>   It was an important game but, strangely, not a very interesting
one.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut went on a 12-4 run at the end of the first half and
took a 12-point lead into intermission.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Illinois, which defeated Texas Tech and Georgia to get
here, was too good to go away quietly but not quite good enough to
ever mount a serious threat.</TE>
<TE>   The Salukis cut the lead to six points three times in the second
half, yet the Huskies countered every punch.</TE>
<TE>   Did the Huskies have problems?</TE>
<TE>   You bet.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut had no answer in the first half for Southern Illinois'
6-foot-6 center Rolan Roberts. Saluki Coach Bruce Weber made an
interesting strategic decision to attack Emeka Okafor, Connecticut's
talented freshman center.</TE>
<TE>   "They ran the first seven plays right at him," Calhoun said of the
strategy. "That's great coaching, because they challenged him."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts scored his team's first eight points, all on inside
baskets, and had 16 of his game-high 24 points in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   But Weber's attack tactic couldn't beat Connecticut alone. Roberts
and forward Jermaine Dearman, who finished with 17 points, accounted
for 41 of the team's 59 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Salukis didn't have enough weapons. Their perimeter shooters
made only one of 14 three-point attempts under heavy pressure from
Connecticut guards Taliek Brown and Tony Robertson.</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies did a terrific job frustrating Saluki guard Kent
Williams, the team's leading scorer at 16 points per game. Williams
made only two of 11 shots and finished with seven points.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to fight for every open shot I got," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   Even Roberts couldn't stay hot forever. Connecticut slowed him
down in the second half with double teams.</TE>
<TE>   "We got someone down to 'rake the post'", was how Calhoun put it.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the pesky Salukis tried desperately to keep up.</TE>
<TE>   Dearman's free throw with 3:16 left cut the lead to six at 62-56,
but Caron Butler's basket and three free throws in the next minute
pushed the lead back to 11.</TE>
<TE>   "They kept enough distance on us," Weber lamented. "We couldn't
get over the hump."</TE>

<HD>A Win, but Maryland Waiting to Celebrate</HD>
<DH>East: Despite brushing aside Kentucky, 78-68, Terrapins'
focus remains on atoning for last season's loss in semifinals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SYRACUSE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Duke is out of the NCAA tournament and Kentucky has been sent back to
its old Kentucky home.</LD>
<LD>   Things are moving along nicely for the Maryland Terrapins, on a
quest to win the national title that eluded them last year.</LD>
<LD>   A night after nemesis Duke was ousted, Maryland took another step
to the Final Four with a 78-68 victory over Kentucky in an East
Regional semifinal game before 29,633 at the Carrier Dome.</LD>
<TE>   No. 1-seeded Maryland (29-4) will play No. 2 Connecticut in
Sunday's regional final. It will be the teams' second meeting.
Maryland was a 12-point winner in a nonconference game at
Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   Before the teams could meet again, Maryland had to take care of
Kentucky first. And the Terrapins were about as workmanlike as you
could get.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky (22-10) entered the game as the team with the heritage,
winners of seven national titles, but the schools are on different
tracks now.</TE>
<TE>   After the victory, Maryland players did not walk off the court as
if they had defeated one of basketball's most storied programs.</TE>
<TE>   The Terrapins, in fact, did not celebrate much at all.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a veteran team," Maryland Coach Gary Williams said.
"Sometimes I wish they were more emotional. Every team has its
identity. This is this year's team."</TE>
<TE>   You could call "resolve" what Maryland was displaying. This is
basically the same team that went to the Final Four last year and
blew a 22-point first-half lead to Duke in a semifinal game.</TE>
<TE>   Not even victories over Kentucky are to be celebrated.</TE>
<TE>   The job is not done.</TE>
<TE>   "In this situation, you have to hold all the emotion for the next
game," Williams said. "You can't waste it."</TE>
<TE>   It appeared that Kentucky, reborn in the tournament after a
turbulent season, might give Maryland a run. The score was tied at 53
with 10 minutes left, but Kentucky's play down the stretch resembled
the tattered team it had been until NCAA tournament victories against
Valparaiso and Tulsa made it feel good to be bluegrass again.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky squandered chance after chance.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats scored only two baskets in the last six minutes, but
that was only half of it.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland was up, 68-63, when Kentucky buckled.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Bogans missed the front end of a one-on-one free throw.
Tayshaun Prince missed a three-point shot. Bogans missed another
front end. Prince missed again on a drive.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Hayes finally scored with 1:53 left to make it 70-65, but
the mistakes kept coming. Jules Camara was called for traveling.
Bogans dropped a pass out of bounds. Gerald Fitch missed a
three-point shot.</TE>
<TE>   It's the kind of stuff that can turn a close game into a 10-point
loss.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't take those back," Prince said of the mistakes. "Those
were just plays we didn't make in the end and it cost us."</TE>
<TE>   Prince, who scored 41 points in last weekend's victory over Tulsa,
was held to 17 in his final collegiate game. He made only six of 16
shots. Maryland forward Byron Mouton did the bulk of the stellar
defensive work against Prince, with Drew Nicholas helping out in
relief.</TE>
<TE>   Prince knew his last game would feel like this.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, it hurts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The final minutes became a microcosm of the Wildcats' season,
which was wracked with suspensions, transfers and inconsistent play.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky Coach Tubby Smith was happy to salvage what he could in
recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We've really taken on a different attitude and dimension," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland's attitude has been rock steady for months. Friday, four
players scored in double figures against Kentucky. Juan Dixon led the
Terrapins with 19.</TE>
<TE>   The only Terrapin who struggled was guard Steve Blake, who made
only two of nine shots and finished with four points.</TE>
<TE>   You sensed Blake couldn't wait to get back on the court.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I played bad," he said. "I have to play better the
next game. It's good to see that even though I played bad the other
guys could step up."</TE>

<HD>Galaxy's Stars Have That Familiar Look</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Tonight at Rose Bowl, team opens MLS season with
plenty of holdovers, including two from 1996 opener.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>And then there were two.</LD>
<LD>   When the Galaxy opens its seventh season at the Rose Bowl tonight,
there will be only two players on the field who were there when a
crowd of 69,255 turned out to see the team's inaugural Major League
Soccer game in 1996.</LD>
<LD>   Mauricio Cienfuegos and Cobi Jones have run a lot of miles for Los
Angeles since that April 13 afternoon, and they will run a lot more
before the team moves into its 27,000-seat stadium in Carson next
spring.</LD>
<TE>   Cienfuegos has played 192 games for the Galaxy and Jones 183. No
one else comes close.</TE>
<TE>   Last season brought the pair their first real rewards for all that
effort--victories in the CONCACAF Champions Cup and the Lamar Hunt
U.S. Open Cup.</TE>
<TE>   But the one bit of silverware that has eluded the team through
three coaches, four general managers and six seasons is the Alan I.
Rothenberg Trophy awarded each fall to the MLS champion.</TE>
<TE>   Three times Cienfuegos, Jones and the rest of the Galaxy have
reached the title game, and three times they have fallen at the final
hurdle.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's 2-1 overtime loss to the San Jose Earthquakes was
especially cruel.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight at 7 the Galaxy meets D.C. United, the team that denied it
the title in 1996 and 1999. And if the Galaxy looks familiar, it's
because Coach Sigi Schmid resisted making many off-season changes.
The 2002 roster has only six new players.</TE>
<TE>   Not that there was much need to tinker. For instance, the Galaxy
has the best one-two goalkeeping punch in the league in Kevin Hartman
and Matt Reis. One was supposed to have been traded in the off-season
so that both could be starters, but MLS contraction put an end to
that plan. Instead, they will battle for the Galaxy starting spot and
probably end up sharing the role as they did last season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a blessing and it's a curse," Schmid said. "It's a blessing
because they're two great goalkeepers and it's a curse because
they're probably the only two who have been together for five years
in this league [with one having to be on the bench].</TE>
<TE>   "We'll just have to wait and see. They've been very professional
about it. They've been very good about it. We're going to have to
play the guy who we think is better [at the time]. The good thing
about it is our team is very confident with either goalkeeper and we
feel we can win with either one."</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Ezra Hendrickson, widely regarded as the finest
right back in the league. The lanky captain of the St. Vincent and
the Grenadines national team had his best MLS season in 2001, scoring
five winning goals from his position on defense.</TE>
<TE>   Hendrickson doesn't believe the Galaxy needed to change much. "We
don't rebuild, we just reload," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The retirement of Paul Caligiuri and the departure of Greg Vanney,
who signed a four-year contract with Bastia in the French first
division, meant the Galaxy defense did need some help, however.</TE>
<TE>   It arrived in another Caribbean player, Tyrone Marshall, a Jamaica
national team starter and a player whose speed and ability to play in
the center or out wide will greatly benefit a defense that includes
Alexi Lalas, Danny Califf, Adam Frye and Craig Waibel.</TE>
<TE>   Schmid said he will wait and see how the defense performs without
the vastly experienced Caligiuri and Vanney before making any more
changes.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to panic at this stage and try to sign a defender
right away," he said. "We're going to see how this group plays, but
by the same token we're keeping our eyes and ears open, we're looking
at people who can play back there because that's an area [where] we
might need to add some depth."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles' midfield remains intact, with two slight changes.
Cienfuegos and Jones are there, of course, as are Simon Elliott,
Peter Vagenas and Alex Bengard.</TE>
<TE>   Dropping back from the forward position he played with
considerable success last season is Sasha Victorine, whose seven
goals in 2001 were second on the team only to Mexican striker Luis
Hernandez. Added Friday, from the Portland Timbers of the A-League,
was Mexican-born Jesus Ochoa, who grew up in Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   Schmid said midfield "is a more natural position" for Victorine,
adding that he expects him to be as effective in the new role.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to find his way to score six to eight goals," he said.
"I think it just makes us offensively a more dangerous team, a
tougher team to mark."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents are likely to find the Galaxy's offense difficult to
contain.</TE>
<TE>   The front line features four newcomers: Guatemalan national team
striker Carlos Ruiz; U.S. 2000 Olympic team forward Chris Albright;
as well as draft picks Gavin Glinton, a four-time All-American from
Bradley University, and Alejandro Moreno from the University of North
Carolina Greensboro, also added Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Then, too, Brian Mullan returns from a promising rookie season
that was cut short by injury. He probably will partner with Ruiz up
front in a 4-4-2 formation, with Schmid also able to call on
Albright, Glinton, Moreno and Isaias Bardales Jr. as forwards should
he opt for a 4-3-3 lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz is the key, however. The latest in a long line of foreign
Galaxy strikers that includes Ecuador's Eduardo "El Tanque" Hurtado
and Mexico's Carlos Hermosillo and Hernandez, he is the player
expected to lead the team in scoring.</TE>
<TE>   "Ruiz has fit in well," Schmid said. "I think that what the guys
really admire about Carlos is they know that if they play the ball
into the box he's going to fight and scratch to get on the end of it.
That's something that we haven't always had.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll have some streaks where he won't get some goals, but I'm
confident that he'll be our leading scorer this year."</TE>
<TE>   All of which is good news to Cienfuegos and Jones, the two
originals who, as always, will be providing the passes that ignite
the offense.</TE>

<HD>Mickelson Makes It Exciting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With flair, a few flops and a game plan for which he makes no
apologies, Phil Mickelson jumped right back into contention in the
Players Championship at Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   He played 25 holes on Friday in even par, but don't get the idea
it was a conservative, plodding style he finds so unacceptable. After
finishing a first-round 64, he was 11 strokes higher in the second
round.</LD>
<LD>   When his long and exciting day ended, Mickelson was at
five-under-par 139, trailing clubhouse leader Carl Paulson by one
shot when play was suspended by darkness.</LD>
<TE>   "If I change the way I play golf, I won't enjoy the game as much
and I won't play to the level I have been playing," Mickelson said.
"I won't ever change--not tomorrow, not Sunday or at Augusta or the
U.S. Open, or any tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "I may never win a major that way, but it doesn't matter to me.
That's how I play my best golf."</TE>
<TE>   Paulson had his second 69 and was at 138, unknown territory for a
31-year-old who has never won on the PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Perks had a 68 and was at 139. Jeff Sluman also was at five
under with two holes remaining when he returns today--starting with
the terrorizing island-green 17th.</TE>
<TE>   In whipping wind that began to dry out the greens and bring
indecision into just about every shot, no one managed to run away
from the field--36 players were within five shots of the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods was among them. Despite chopping out from thick rough
and making bogey on the 18th hole, Woods had a 72 and was one under.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything under par, you're going to be moving up," Woods said.</TE>
<TE>   The cut will not be made until today, but even those who barely
qualify for the final two rounds probably will be only eight strokes
behind. That could set up a tight finish, perhaps a weekend of
survival if the wind continues to howl.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Juli Inkster shot out of the pack with an eight-under 64, good for
a three-shot lead over Dorothy Delasin and Nancy Scranton in the
Welch's-Circle K Championship.</TE>
<TE>   No stranger to the interview tent at Randolph Park, Inkster won
one of her 26 LPGA titles in Tucson in 1999, finished third--one
stroke out of a playoff between Annika Sorenstam and Pat Hurst--the
next and tied for seventh last year.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, she has charged from behind, with final-round scores
of 65, 64 and 67, respectively, the last three years. This time,
Inkster's fast start put her at 14-under 130, a 36-hole Tucson record
that is three strokes better than Sorenstam's pace last year, when
she finished at a record 23 under.</TE>
<TE>   Delasin and Scranton started the round a shot behind first-round
leader Ashli Bunch and posted matching 68s.</TE>

<HD>Stanford Would Shine in This Final Four</HD>
<DH>Academics: Cardinal boasts best graduation rate for teams
in the men's tournament field.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News Service</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If NCAA tournament games were decided in the classroom instead of on
the basketball court, the Stanford Cardinal would be cutting down the
nets as national champions.</LD>
<LD>   According to the NCAA's most recent graduation statistics, every
scholarship player who entered Stanford's men's basketball program
from 1991-94 graduated within six years.</LD>
<LD>   In a comparison of graduation rates matching teams in this year's
NCAA tournament, Stanford would easily advance to the Final Four.
That wasn't the case on the court, as top-seeded Kansas routed the
Cardinal, 86-63, in the second round of the Midwest Regional.</LD>
<TE>   "Stanford University is committed to a strong tradition of
academic and athletic excellence," Stanford Athletic Director Ted
Leland said. "It is expected that our student-athletes not only excel
in their athletic endeavors, but in the classroom as well."</TE>
<TE>   Based on NCAA graduation rates, the other schools reaching the
Final Four would be St. John's from the East Regional, Notre Dame
from the South and Xavier from the West.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Stanford, no other school in this year's tournament field
graduated more than 80% of its scholarship players during the most
recent study period, according to the NCAA's statistics. Pennsylvania
wasn't included because Ivy League schools don't offer athletic
scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford's 100% graduation would top St. John's 80% rate in one
national semifinal, while Notre Dame's 77% rate would beat Xavier's
70% in the other semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford, which graduated all 11 of its men's scholarship players
who entered the school from 1991-94, would then beat Notre Dame in
the final.</TE>
<TE>   The overall graduation rate for Division I men's basketball
players who entered school from 1991-94 was 40%. The graduation rate
for male students during that span was 55%.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas, which beat Stanford on the court, wouldn't have gotten
past the first round of this year's tournament bracket based on
graduation rates. Neither would any of the other No. 1 seeds,
including Duke, which is known for its strong academics. Kansas had a
64% graduation rate, Maryland 19% and Cincinnati 8%.</TE>
<TE>   Three schools in this year's tournament field failed to graduate a
single men's basketball player who entered school from 1991-94 during
the six-year period, according to the NCAA.</TE>
<TE>   Of the three--Oklahoma, Hawaii and McNeese State--only the Sooners
are still in the tournament.</TE>

<HD>Siphonic Has Sore Ankle, Will Miss Triple Crown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two months ago, he was considered one of the favorites for the
Kentucky Derby, but now Siphonic is headed for a long rest. The
Hollywood Park-based 3-year-old colt will miss the Derby as well as
the rest of the Triple Crown races.</LD>
<LD>   After two lackluster races at Santa Anita, the most recent a
third-place finish as the 2-5 favorite in Sunday's San Felipe Stakes,
trainer David Hofmans said that Siphonic has a sore right front
ankle. Siphonic apparently jammed the ankle in the San Felipe, a race
he led for a mile before getting beat by six lengths.</LD>
<LD>   "It's nothing serious, but we're going to play it safe and avoid
anything more serious happening," Hofmans said. "We could have gone
on, but it's not worth taking a chance. It's very frustrating, but
it's the right thing to do."</LD>
<TE>   Siphonic will be sent to the Temecula farm of his owners, John and
Jerry Amerman. He is expected to return to training in a month or two
and will be prepared for a late-season campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Siphonic won the Lane's End Breeders' Futurity at
Churchill Downs and the Hollywood Futurity, and in between finished
third in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. He finished second, behind
Breeders' Cup winner Johannesburg, in the Eclipse Award voting for
best 2-year-old male.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Bailey, who rode Siphonic in the Breeders' Cup for the first
time, thought enough of the colt to leave his Florida base twice to
ride him at Santa Anita this year. In his first start as a
3-year-old, Siphonic ran second to Labamta Babe in the Santa
Catalina, beaten by 51/2 lengths but compromised by a poor start in
which he almost fell.</TE>
<TE>   Labamta Babe is also injured, and Siphonic's defection further
weakens a Derby crop that was considered thin to begin with.</TE>
<TE>   "You could have taken the seventh-best 3-year-old last year at
this time, and he would have been the leader this year," said John
Ward Jr., who trains Booklet, the fourth-place finisher in last
Saturday's Florida Derby.</TE>
<TE>   The undefeated Johannesburg, an Irish-based colt, isn't scheduled
to make his 3-year-old debut until April 6 in England, and stateside
there is still much sorting out to do. The newest contenders are San
Felipe winner Medaglia D'Oro, bought by Edmund Gann and trainer Bobby
Frankel after Labamta Babe went to the sidelines, and Mayakovsky and
Saarland, who were 1-2 in the Gotham at Aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   Medaglia D'Oro is scheduled to run against Mayakovsky and Saarland
in the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct on April 13, which leaves Came Home
as the favorite for the Santa Anita Derby on April 6. Came Home
worked five furlongs Friday in 1:003/5. Other Santa Anita probables
are Yougottawanna, Danthebluegrassman, Easy Grades, Fonz's, U S S
Tinosa and Lusty Latin.</TE>

<HD>Record Is All in a Day's Work for Peirsol</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Arritt</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aaron Peirsol returned to the pool in Minneapolis on Thursday, a day
after setting a world record in the 200-meter backstroke, and
immediately became aware that others took a special interest in his
presence.</LD>
<LD>   "Just walking on deck," Peirsol said by phone, "I could tell the
officials understood that I had a good swim the night before."</LD>
<LD>   Back at Newport Harbor High, where Peirsol is a senior, his
accomplishment at the Phillips 66 Spring National was the talk of the
Thursday morning workout.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's just amazing," said junior Brent Armstrong, a
teammate. "He can swim so fast and he's so modest about it."</TE>
<TE>   Peirsol's coach at the Irvine Novaquatics swim club, Dave Salo,
was probably most affected by the record-setting performance.
Peirsol's time of 1 minute 55.15 seconds surpassed Lenny
Krayzelburg's previous world record by .72. It was a goal Salo and
Peirsol first discussed five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, these things don't happen very often in a coach's
career," Salo said from Minneapolis. "You'd be lucky to get one
world-record holder in your lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   At home in Irvine, Aaron's feat only slightly overshadowed those
of his younger sister, Hayley, who produced two second-place finishes
with personal-best marks in the meet's first three days.</TE>
<TE>   "The phone hasn't stopped ringing," stepfather Tim Hartig said.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise for Aaron. In between calls from family and interviews
with the media, high-fives from fellow swimmers and autographs for
fans, he produced a lifetime best time of 1:51.11 in the 200
freestyle on Thursday, finishing sixth.</TE>
<TE>   He came back to win the 100 backstroke in 54.47 and swam the third
leg for the Irvine Novaquatics' winning 800 freestyle relay team
(7:44.42) on Friday. He'll make one last trip to the pool deck today,
when he will swim the backstroke leg of the 400 medley relay. Peirsol
expects the hoopla to subside by the time he returns Sunday
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "It was such a big thing but it should calm down," he said. "When
it does, then I'll take the time to congratulate myself."</TE>
<TE>   Peirsol, who was runner-up to gold-medalist Krayzelburg in the 200
backstroke at the 2000 Sydney Games, won't have much time before he
leaves for the World Championships, which will be held April 3-7 in
Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Harbor Coach Jason Lynch hopes Peirsol will be on hand
Wednesday when the Sailors host Irvine, the two-time defending
Southern Section Division I champions, in a key Sea View League meet.</TE>
<TE>   Hayley Peirsol, a junior at Newport Harbor, opened the Spring
Nationals with a second-place finish Tuesday in the 800-meter
freestyle. Peirsol's time of 8:34.94 was eight seconds faster than
her previous best.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, she finished second in the 400 individual medley in
4:50.30, nearly five seconds faster than her previous best. Andrienne
Binder, a junior at Santa Barbara San Marcos High, won in 4:44.65.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine High sophomore Diana MacManus won the women's 200
backstroke in 2:11.80 on Wednesday and the 100 backstroke in 1:01.32
on Friday. Tustin senior Michael Cavic won the 100 butterfly in 53.30
on Friday.</TE>

<LD>The Dubai World Cup carries a purse that, at $6 million, is 40 times
larger, but the $150,000 Santa Ana Handicap is the best race that
will be run anywhere today.</LD>
<LD>   A Grade II that is a prep for the $250,000 Santa Barbara Handicap
on April 20, the Santa Ana attracted five Grade I winners and will be
the ninth of 10 races today at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Headed by Astra, the 5-2 morning-line favorite, the five top
contenders in the race have combined to win 36 of 97 starts and earn
$4,629,152.</LD>
<TE>   Now trained by Laura De Seroux after winning eight of 11 for
trainer Simon Bray, Astra, a 6-year-old Theatrical mare, will be
making her first start since she floundered at 7-10 in the Beverly D.
at Arlington Park on Aug. 18. Astra, who will be ridden by Kent
Desormeaux, is four for four at 11/8 miles, the Santa Ana distance.</TE>
<TE>   The richest of the Santa Ana participants is Tout Charmant, who
has earned $1,712,879 in winning eight of 26.</TE>
<TE>   She is one for one at the meet, having won the San Gorgonio
Handicap on Jan. 13 for owners Robert and Janice McNair's Stonerside
Stable and trainer Ron McAnally.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the big five are Starine, who won the Grade II Diana
Handicap at Saratoga last summer before completing her year with a
win in the Matriarch at Hollywood Park on Nov. 25; Janet, who won the
Yellow Ribbon and Ramona last year; and Golden Apples, who won the
Del Mar Oaks in her U.S. debut Aug. 18.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The 10th race features Partners Choice, who was
purchased for $2.5 million in the summer of 1999 and will make his
first start for owners B. Wayne Hughes and the Thoroughbred Corp. and
trainer Ron Ellis.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot:  Fog City Willy, the 6-year-old gelding who will try
for his third consecutive win in today's fifth at Golden Gate Fields.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not:  Jockey Osman Cedeno, who will ride longshot Princess
Slew Cat in today's first at Santa Anita, is 0 for 28 in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Modernist, Sonoita and
California Power in the eighth, using Tout Charmant and Golden Apples
in the ninth and Heavenly Search, Partners Choice and Gotham City in
the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/176. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $7.80/$1,039.20. Total money bet: $1,078.</TE>

<HD>'Pit Bull' Tackles Pitfalls, Pit Stops</HD>
<DH>Motor racing: DeVries, a neophyte in IRL, races for
Sprewell-backed team at Fontana and, he hopes, at Indy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John deVries, self-styled "pit bull of the Indy Racing League," was
beginning to discuss his childhood days in Newport Beach with a
reporter when the phone rang in his California Speedway garage.</LD>
<LD>   "It's Spree," said the bald 36-year-old IRL driver. "He calls
after every practice session, wanting to know how we did. He's really
into racing."</LD>
<LD>   Spree is Latrell Sprewell, the New York Knick forward, whose
Sprewell Motorsports is part owner of the Pit Bull-Rhino Racing team
for whom DeVries drives.</LD>
<TE>   DeVries' top speed of 215.673 mph in his No. 37 Dallara-Chevrolet
during the first round of practice for Sunday's Yamaha Indy 400 was
27th fastest of 32 cars that appeared on the two-mile oval Friday.</TE>
<TE>   DeVries, who dabbled in karts as a teenager in Huntington Beach
and did not begin racing until he was past 30 and living in
Australia, may be one of the least experienced drivers planning to
compete in the Indianapolis 500. He first sat in an IRL car on Jan.
31, passed his driver's test in February and drove his first race
March 2 at Homestead, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   "Sounds kind of gutsy, doesn't it?" he said with a grin. "Well,
I'm a gutsy guy. I told Spree and [team manager] Cecil Hsu that if
they put the right car under me, I could put the car where it needed
to be."</TE>
<TE>   Television viewers who watched the IRL race in Phoenix last Sunday
may remember DeVries as the driver whose car careened out of control
in the second turn and slid through a fence opening into the
spectator area, where it slammed into an infield wall.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank God I didn't hit anyone," said the 5-foot-8, 200-pound De-
Vries.</TE>
<TE>   Todd and Teri Brayton of the racing Brayton family of Coldwater,
Mich., bought Tri-Star Motorsports' equipment last year, and with
engines built by Lee Brayton, Todd's father, decided to join the IRL
and get back to Indy.</TE>
<TE>   A Brayton-built engine powered Eddie Cheever's winning car in the
1998 Indianapolis 500.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Brayton, Todd's brother, drove in 14 Indy races and was on
the pole for the 1996 Indy race but was killed while practicing at
the speedway.</TE>
<TE>   The merger of DeVries, Sprewell and the Braytons came about
through Hsu, who works with Sprewell at the basketball player's
automotive specialty shop in San Gabriel.</TE>
<TE>   "I had been in Australia for four years, racing in Formula Ford
and Formula Holden series, when I came back in '99 and started
looking for a ride," DeVries said. "I was a stockholder in Hip Hop
Beverage Co. [makers of Pit Bull energy drink] and when I heard the
Braytons were building a new team, an acquaintance arranged for me to
test for them.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since I was a little kid, I told my mother I wanted to drive
in the Indy 500 and whatever I put my mind to, I accomplish. So when
an opportunity to test an Indy car came, I was ready, even though I
had never even sat in one before. I took my rookie test at California
Speedway in a terrible wind, but I worked my way up to 217 [mph] and
passed with no problems."</TE>
<TE>   DeVries is a late bloomer because when he was younger, he was busy
building a Subway sandwich shop empire. He opened his first shop in
Corona when he was 19 and before leaving for Australia in 1994, he
had Subways through the Coachella Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to Australia to develop some Subway business and for
recreation I started racing," he said. "When I wasn't racing, I did a
lot of test driving."</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, he won the Silver Star championship in the Formula Holden
series, in which one of his competitors was Scott Dixon, the New
Zealander who is driving this year in CART. DeVries still owns
several restaurants in Australia, a cosmetic company and an ATM
business.</TE>
<TE>   Sprewell is the latest in a number of professional athletes who
have become involved in racing.</TE>
<TE>   "One of Latrell's dreams is to be involved with motorsports at its
highest level," said Hsu. "By fielding a vehicle to compete in the
Indy 500, he fulfills that dream.</TE>
<TE>   "He also feels that his presence in the IRL--he plans to be at
every race once the NBA season is over--could also spark interest in
other players in the NBA, which might start a snowball effect with
the IRL emerging as the victors."</TE>

<LD>Veteran Belgian endurance driver Didier Theys, two-time winner of the
Daytona 24 Hour race, won the pole for today's Grand American Rolex
400 at California Speedway on Friday with a lap of 113.874 mph in his
Judd-powered Dallara.</LD>
<LD>   Theys, also the 1987 Indy Lights champion, dominated every
practice session and was more than 3 mph faster than runner-up James
Weaver of Dyson Racing. Weaver's Crawford-Judd ran 110.575 mph around
the 21-turn, 2.8-mile course that incorporates turns one and two and
the front straightaway of the oval track.</LD>
<LD>   The Grand-Am Rolex race, with 22 starters, will begin at 12:30

<LD>As improbable as it might have sounded four months ago, when their
only thought was digging out of the Western Conference cellar, the
Kings will take over the Pacific Division lead if they defeat the San
Jose Sharks today.</LD>
<LD>   Both teams would have 85 points, but the Kings would hold the
upper hand because they have played one fewer game.</LD>
<LD>   "As long as that's where we are in April, it would feel great,"
Coach Andy Murray said Friday. "If it comes the end of the season and
we're first in our division, that would be a major feat. But I'm just
so scared of everybody behind us that I still have a hard time
looking at it that way....</LD>
<TE>   "But at the end of the regular season, if we're first in our
division, it would be great. The run we're on right now is great. We
can't downplay it, and, obviously, we've got to keep it up. But our
guys have done some great things."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, 27-8-5-2 since Dec. 8, have trimmed 12 points from the
Sharks' lead during their surge, the Sharks going 23-16-3 during the
same period.</TE>
<TE>   After today, the Kings open a four-game trip Sunday at Phoenix and
play six of their last 11 games on the road. The Sharks return to San
Jose tonight, open a six-game home stand Tuesday against the Dallas
Stars and play seven of their last 10 at home, including their
regular-season finale April 13 against the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Roy of the Colorado Avalanche, the NHL leader in
goals-against average and second in save percentage, is enjoying one
of the best seasons of his great career, but he posted mediocre
numbers against the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   In splitting four starts against the Kings, including Thursday
night's 3-1 loss at Staples Center, the Avalanche goaltender had a
3.26 GAA and .859 save percentage. Against the rest of the league,
his GAA is 1.82, his save percentage .930.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't look at it that way," Murray said. "We would think
that he's been pretty good against us and that we've made him look
bad."</TE>

<HD>Richmond, Shaw Still Trying to Fit In</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While most of the Lakers would not admit to the importance of
end-to-end home-court advantage--they swept the San Antonio Spurs
without it last season--Brian Shaw has become an ardent proponent of
winning the Pacific Division and the Western Conference titles.</LD>
<LD>   The NBA has a system of financial bonuses for such regular-season
feats, and Shaw lost as much as $1.3 million in salary in an
early-season roster transaction. "I'm trying to make up some money,"
he said, laughing, after the Lakers beat the Detroit Pistons on
Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Shaw, for a change, could have some say in it, depending on the
backcourt rotation in the next 31/2 weeks. Shaw played 12 minutes and
Mitch Richmond played none against the Pistons.</LD>
<TE>   So, 14 games from the postseason, where player rotations tighten
anyway, Phil Jackson has not found a consistent substitution pattern
involving Richmond or Shaw.</TE>
<TE>   While Richmond, the off-guard, has played more recently and
appears to be finding his shooting stroke, he is averaging 11.2
minutes and shooting 28.6% on three-point attempts. He has taken the
majority of the minutes left over at off-guard, those that might also
be given to Shaw.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw, who averages less than 10 minutes despite his nice touch
with the triangle offense, had 16 points and seven rebounds in 16
minutes of blowout time Wednesday in San Antonio, and had two points
and two rebounds Friday. His gift is that he plays well despite
sitting for long periods, which makes it easier for Jackson to play
Richmond.</TE>
<TE>   "It is good about him," Jackson said, grinning. "But, that's why
he makes that fabulous salary. That was cut in half."</TE>
<TE>   Shaw was waived and re-signed for about half his original salary
in the first week of the regular season, a move designed to keep the
Lakers beneath the luxury-tax ceiling. It appears now there will be
no luxury tax.</TE>
<TE>   Without Ron Harper, Shaw is as close as the Lakers have to a bench
player with a calming influence on the offense. "It's not the same
thing, but he does give us a certain skill out there on the floor,"
Jackson said. "I don't know if [more minutes] is what's important for
Brian. I'd like to do it, but I think he's ready to play when called
upon."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After overhearing a conversation recently about a local girls'
basketball player who idolizes him, Kobe Bryant volunteered to give
her a pair of his shoes, autographed.</TE>
<TE>   Sade Wiley-Gatewood, a sophomore guard for a Lynwood High team
that today in Sacramento will play for the Division I final, was on
her way to practice when she heard the shoes were on their way. "The
other girls aren't going to know why I'm smiling so hard," she said.</TE>

<HD>Pistons Caught in Middle</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: With Texas trouble behind them and
Sacramento ahead, Lakers finally put away Detroit, 94-82.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is a dark and foreboding week in March when the easy game is
against a division leader that has lost twice on the road in more
than two months, and the critical game is still two days off, and all
anyone can think about is how bad they had been for two days in
Texas.</LD>
<LD>   All regular-season details, to be sure, but these are the Lakers,
and those are their issues, and nothing about the Lakers is ever
insignificant.</LD>
<LD>   So it was that the Lakers defeated the Detroit Pistons, 94-82, on
Friday night at Staples Center, with 28 points from Shaquille O'Neal
and 18 from Kobe Bryant, and just enough from everyone else,
including 10 rebounds each from power forwards Samaki Walker and
Robert Horry.</LD>
<TE>   Now they get the Sacramento Kings, leaders of the Pacific Division
and the Western Conference, Sunday at Arco Arena.</TE>
<TE>   After nearly 40 points' worth of losses in Dallas and San Antonio
in midweek, the Lakers pushed themselves through the Pistons just
hard enough to save something for the Kings, they presumably hope,
because they need to make up 11/2 games--they are two losses
back--some time in the next 14. They also play the Kings on the last
day of the regular season, at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we ready for Sunday?" Rick Fox repeated. "We'll find out.
We're not playing the prettiest basketball right now."</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, the Lakers stepped far enough away from those
losses with the victory, if not necessarily the most seamless of
efforts. There were too many fouls and too many offensive lapses and
too much of overbearing referee David Jones for that, but they
shrugged and promised to board their charter tonight, and they'd find
out about the Kings with everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't win this ballgame on Sunday it's going to be
difficult to win the division," Coach Phil Jackson said. "We're going
to have to get that game and hopefully get some help along the way."</TE>
<TE>   First, there were the Pistons to think of, because the Lakers had
no interest in arriving in Sacramento on a three-game losing streak,
and because they have already had their fill of losses to lesser
foes.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew going into this week it was going to be tough," Brian
Shaw said. "That's why you beat the teams you're supposed to beat,
and we didn't always do that."</TE>
<TE>   Considering the Pistons don't have a player with the size of
O'Neal, the Lakers spent an inordinate amount of time heaving
three-pointers. They were four for 21 from the arc. When they did
focus on O'Neal, as they did for a time late in the third quarter,
the Lakers broke open a close game.</TE>
<TE>   From 56-56, O'Neal scored eight of the next 12 Laker points, two
on hard dunks, and by the end of the third quarter the Lakers led,
70-60. In all, O'Neal scored 11 points in the third quarter after the
entire team scored 16 in the second.</TE>
<TE>   Their offense so redirected, the Lakers scored on their first four
possessions of the fourth quarter, and led, 79-63, when Bryant flung
a behind-the-back pass to Fox for a fastbreak layup. The Pistons got
within seven points at 85-78, but no closer.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a little on track," O'Neal said, "but not fully."</TE>
<TE>   Still, there were critics, because the Lakers aren't close to
their game yet.</TE>
<TE>   "This wasn't a good win," Horry said. "Against a team like this
you are meant to have a much better outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a team we should have beaten by 20 points."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the game's flow was fractured by 28 Laker fouls and 20
Laker turnovers and two Laker technicals.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant received his technical from referee Jones early in the
third quarter. After Bryant believed he had been fouled, causing a
turnover, he tossed the ball to Jones with what Jones determined to
be excessive force.</TE>
<TE>   Six Piston possessions later, Jones effectively put Bryant on the
bench. Bryant was assessed his third and fourth fouls within seconds
of each other, one chasing a rebound and the other running with
Stackhouse 22 feet from the basket.</TE>
<TE>   Jones also gave O'Neal a technical.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody was a little off-kilter," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   The fouls killed the momentum Bryant built in a strong first half
spent beating Stackhouse off the dribble and defending him with grit.
Bryant made seven of 12 first-half attempts, and had two or three
others rim out, all while hounding Stackhouse into four misses in six
attempts and but seven points. Bryant's fouls, however, sent Devean
George after Stackhouse, who finished with 21 points on five-for-13
shooting.</TE>

<LD>Coach Wooden said, "Do not confuse activity for achievement." I think
he was referring to Sweet 16 appearances.</LD>
<LD>   Jon Banks</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   About the time UCLA starts hanging "Sweet 16" banners in Pauley
Pavilion and USC starts hanging "Las Vegas Bowl participant" banners
in Heritage Hall, then everyone will accept the accomplishments of
Steve Lavin.</TE>
<TE>   Victor Wilson</TE>
<TE>   Palos Verdes Estates</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After six years of Steve Lavin, it's pretty obvious what he can
and can't accomplish at UCLA. He will never compete for a national
championship. He will not make a Final Four, as that would require
four consecutive victories over increasingly difficult competition.
He will not win another conference title. He will win on the low side
of 20 games each year and will win a couple of games in the NCAA
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   For a school with the tradition and capacity for greatness of
UCLA, it's not nearly enough. And that's why each year, the Pauley
crowds become sparser and less vocal; why Lavin, much to his apparent
surprise, is the target of so much criticism. It's why many alumni
and fans root in vain for total implosion, as the only hope of
escaping this limbo. But because the clueless chancellor and
incompetent athletic department seem quite satisfied, we'll
undoubtedly be forced to suffer through more of this dreariness.</TE>
<TE>   Wake us all up next March for another one-week season.</TE>
<TE>   William Platt</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oh, so that's it. Bill Plaschke has it figured out. Lavin cost us
the game (again) by giving Matt Barnes a rest. Forget about leading
scorer and probable soon-to-be pro Jason Kapono inexplicably
disappearing yet again in a big game. Forget about a great
performance by Missouri's outside shooters, going 10 for 23 from the
three-point line. Forget that sometimes the ball just bounces the
other way.</TE>
<TE>   Nope, for Plaschke, and too many others, its always about Lavin
when the Bruins lose. Of course, the "hounds will be barking again"
started in your pages. One minute and 38 seconds? Maybe the coach
should have put himself in the game and hit a couple threes.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Duncan</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bill Plaschke's comments regarding the UCLA loss are ridiculous
and clearly demonstrate that he knows little about active sports and
even less about coaching. Lavin's pulling Barnes had nothing to do
with the loss. Dude, the kid can't play the whole game, and Lavin
can't defend or shoot from the bench, as, obviously, you can from the
keyboard.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Jensen</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Passing of the baton?" You've got to be kidding! No offense to
guys like Hoffart and Johnson, but the game wasn't out of reach. Even
with no timeouts remaining, 46 seconds in college basketball is an
eternity.</TE>
<TE>   Down by seven, it was still a two-, or perhaps three-possession
game. A missed shot, quick steal or lucky bounce and the Bruins are
right back in it. Steve, did you see the end of Duke-Indiana? You
were there in '95 when Edney made his run. It's called March Madness
for a reason.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Kichaven</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Bill Plaschke ended his column on Steve Lavin's
coaching technique by asking, "Does it matter?" Mr. Plaschke, yes, it
does matter. The Bruins aren't supposed to be the underdog in
basketball, and we aren't satisfied with solely an appearance in the
Sweet 16.</TE>
<TE>   Emotional highs and athletic ability might get wins over
Cincinnati and Kansas. But inevitably, the emotions swing and we get
smacked with embarrassing losses year after year. So, why get excited
when we get back on an emotional high for a meager two-game win
streak to start the NCAA tournament? We know Lavin and his rah-rah
method cannot sustain an emotional high long enough to achieve four
wins for the Final Four or six for the championship. UCLA clearly had
more talent on the floor than Missouri and Lavin couldn't even get by
a team that had lots of turnovers and an inexperienced coach. The
emotions simply don't last.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Lorenz</TE>
<TE>   La Canada Flintridge</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am once again amused at the trumpeting of Steve Lavin's
"success" in reaching the Sweet 16. Lest anyone be confused by this
latest sleight of hand, please note the following:</TE>
<TE>   1. When you consistently recruit a "top-10" class of athlete,
reaching the "top 16" in the tournament is underachieving.</TE>
<TE>   2. Finishing in the bottom half of the Pac-10 takes total
incompetence with such athletes.</TE>
<TE>   3. Losing regular-season games to such luminaries as Villanova and
Ball State is incredibly embarrassing.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line is, any Division I coach in America with similar
talent could not help matching the "success" of Lavin. More
important, no Division I power would even interview the New Wizard if
he were suddenly unemployed. Being in the right place at the right
time does not a competent coach make!</TE>
<TE>   Mark S. Roth</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ah, Westwood, Land of Impossible Expectations: Lavin's team loses,
it's because of him. Lavin's team wins, it's despite him. It has been
that way since Wooden retired, leaving a legacy and a curse of 10
NCAA basketball championships that bedevils all who follow. No one
has measured up and, as time embellishes the accomplishment's
magnitude, no one will. In Lavin's case, the criticisms are
especially venomous and, if Times writers (who display no reluctance
to lead the boo choir) are correct, he seems to always be on the
bubble and buying time--one more season, one more game.</TE>
<TE>   Within this superheated atmosphere he recruits and perseveres and
succeeds, coaching in one of the toughest conferences in the country,
scheduling fewer encounters with Cupcake U. than most of the anointed
college geniuses, and winning more playoff games than any ordinary
dope should.</TE>
<TE>   For a guy who doesn't know what he's doing, his record seems
implausible. In six seasons, Lavin teams have won 135 times and lost
59. He has never had a year of fewer than 21 victories, with a
per-season average of 22.5. That puts him close to his mentor and
predecessor, Jim Harrick, who in eight years before being banished
won 192 while losing 62.</TE>
<TE>   But those teams should win, the detractors cry. The players are
simply better than their peers. Oh, right. Then how come over this
14-year span there have been only two Associated Press
All-Americans--Ed O'Bannon (twice) and Don MacLean?</TE>
<TE>   A colleague once said, "I've got my mind made up; don't bother me
with facts." He was kidding, of course. In Westwood, though, it seems
to have become a mantra.</TE>

<LD>After the "weak" and "pathetic" Laker expedition to Texas, it's time
for you Laker fans to confront the cold hard truth: No more rings for
Shaq or Kobe or Phil, and the only question is who will have the
honor of delivering the playoff coup de grace.</LD>
<LD>   Will it be the streaking Spurs--gaining vengeance for 2001? Will
it be the surging Trail Blazers--gaining retribution for Game 7 in
2000? Or might it even be the team with the brightest future of all,
the ascending Clippers--gaining justice for the 20th century?</LD>
<LD>   We lifetime Clipper fans are ready for our century. It's over,
Laker fans. You know it's over.</LD>

<LD>David Bluthenthal, on behalf of all USC fans I'd like to apologize to
you for Henry Bibby ruining the last moments of your stellar college
career. People like you do not deserve to be "taught a lesson" in a
game of that magnitude; people like you deserve to be on the floor
giving your team a chance to win as you have so many times before. As
you leave USC and probably the game of basketball, try to remember
there are people like Henry Bibby out there. Stay away from them.</LD>

should be able to run all day ... especially playing only twice a
week! Being a competitive sports participant all my life, I always
knew when we lost to a team we considered to be our inferior that it
was our "overconfidence" that did us in. The Trojans played like the
Trojans for only 10 minutes against North Carolina Wilmington ... and
that made the odds exactly even.</TE>

<LD>With the Dodgers set to open the season in less than two weeks, it's
time to post the "Missing" signs around Los Angeles. It would appear
that the Dodgers' offense has yet to report to spring training ... or
maybe it has? Here's a quick look at some batting averages: Bichette
.175, Beltre .167, Green .103, Grudzielanek .000, Goodwin .200, and
Eric Karros, who unfortunately seems to be in midseason form, .216.</LD>

that Fox Sports gave more media coverage to the Dodgers than the
Angels--alluding to the possibility that Fox ownership in the Dodgers
may be the primary reason behind this disparity.</TE>
<TE>   Well, Mr. Stewart should then ask this question: What explains the
L.A. Times giving more column inches of coverage to the Dodgers than
the Angels regardless of the level of the Dodgers' ineptitude?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As a staff writer for The Times several years ago, I was assigned to
do a feature story on the Nevada Las Vegas basketball program under
Jerry Tarkanian. In addition to Tarkanian, I had wanted to interview
the Rebels' star player, Sidney Green.</LD>
<LD>   Green failed to show for a scheduled interview and Tarkanian was
crestfallen and apologized. A week later, I received a letter from
Green, saying he was sorry he had missed the interview and said it
would not happen again.</LD>
<LD>   It's timely to remember this story as Tarkanian retired last week.
The rap against Tark was always that he'd do anything to win and suit
up any player to that end. But Tark clearly loved his players and did
everything he could to prepare them for life after basketball. His
lessons of responsibility with Green must have done some good. Green,
of course, coached his team, Florida Atlantic, into the NCAAs for the
first time--the same week Tarkanian hung up his towel.</LD>

<LD>So, Art Modell claims that L.A. football fans don't have enough
passion to deserve a precious NFL franchise? Since when did he care
about the passion of fans? He dragged the Browns away from some of
the most passionate fans in the league! What a hypocrite! And the
idiot Ralph Wilson claims that we're too apathetic to back a team?
This area supported two teams! At least until that black widow let
the Rams decay into a joke and the poster-boy for carpetbagging took
the Raiders back where they came from.</LD>
<LD>   As I see it, the NFL has two great problems here. The first one is
that the Coliseum Commission and the local politicos will throw their
weight around and grind everything to a halt. The second is that the
public here in Southern California knows the meaning of the word
chump. We're not about to go into 40 years of debt to let billionaire
owners have a free stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Anyone who thinks there's no support for pro football here is a
fool. And, unfortunately for them, we're nobody's.</LD>

<HD>Victory Lane for Oregon</HD>
<DH>Midwest: Jones' basket with 2.8 seconds left beats Texas,
72-70, and puts Ducks one game from Final Four.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MADISON, Wis.</DL>
<LD>One shot saved the day, saved his team, redeemed his soul. Frederick
Jones stuck in a leaning runner over Deginald Erskin with 2.8 seconds
left to give No. 2-seeded Oregon a 72-70 victory over No. 6 Texas on
Friday night in an NCAA Midwest Regional semifinal game at the Kohl
Center.</LD>
<LD>   Until that basket, only his second of the game, Jones had done
nothing of much importance, nor had he been of much help to his
teammates for the first 39 minutes 57 seconds. But when it mattered,
when it seemed the Ducks (26-8) had wasted for good what had once
been a 13-point second-half lead, Jones took the ball and set his
mind on one thing.</LD>
<LD>   "I had to score," Jones said. "I owed my guys."</LD>
<TE>   Just as he had against USC on Feb. 28, Jones went straight into
the lane, leaned into his defender and scored the winning basket.
Erskin fell onto his back partly from the force of Jones and partly
in the desperate hope of drawing a charging foul.</TE>
<TE>   "When we needed him, Freddie came up big," Oregon point guard Luke
Ridnour said.</TE>
<TE>   Texas freshman T.J. Ford almost came up bigger. The 5-10 point
guard took a pass in the backcourt, dribbled up the floor, skidded to
a stop in the lane and arched a jumper over 7-foot-2 Chris
Christoffersen.</TE>
<TE>   All in 2.8 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought for a minute it was going in," Ford said. "But then,
deep down, I knew it was too hard. It was kind of tough, shooting
over a guy who's 7-2. I knew I had to arch it high."</TE>
<TE>   The celebrating Ducks had to take baby steps over the prostrate
bodies of disconsolate Longhorn players. "It seemed like it took
[Ford's] shot forever to bounce around," Ridnour said. "I held my
breath. It was scary close."</TE>
<TE>   Ridnour, a sophomore, had been fantastic all game, floating around
the perimeter and shooting leaners, arching shots, little hanging
bank shots and scoring 20 points for the Ducks. Luke Jackson,
Oregon's curly haired forward, had taken aim from everywhere and done
his work both inside and outside, layups and three-pointers, while
scoring 25 points. He also had eight assists. The Lukes gave Oregon
its working lead. Then Jones saved them from blowing it.</TE>
<TE>   But until the last three seconds Jones, a Wooden Award finalist,
Oregon's leading scorer, the acrobatic catalyst of the Ducks'
fast-paced offense, had gotten two quick fouls, spent much of the
first half on the bench and most of the second half committing
turnovers or being beaten on defense.</TE>
<TE>   "My overall game was terrible," said Jones, who had scored in
double figures in 27 consecutive games. "I played terrible. Coming
down the stretch I knew we were going to need a big play and I just
hoped I had it in me to be in the position to make one finally. I
needed to redeem myself."</TE>
<TE>   Oregon led, 41-28, at halftime because Jackson nailed a
three-pointer with 0.3 of a second left. "We felt pretty good to have
that lead," Jackson said, "without having Freddie on the floor most
of the time."</TE>
<TE>   But the Longhorns (22-12) capped an 11-0 second-half run when
Brian Boddicker made his third three-pointer in the streak to tie the
score, 51-51, with 12:09 left. The Longhorns helped get themselves
back into the game by getting 14 of the first 17 available rebounds
in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "That was just about working hard," Texas Coach Rick Barnes said.
"Our effort to start the second half was great."</TE>
<TE>   After the 51-51 tie, the Ducks scored the next seven points, Texas

left. Royal Ivey made two free throws to bring Texas within 66-64.
Ford pulled Texas even with two free throws with 1:20 left.</TE>
<TE>   This is Oregon's first regional final since 1960 and the Ducks
will play top-seeded Kansas on Sunday for a trip to the Final Four.
Oregon has already won its first Pac-10 title since 1945.</TE>
<TE>   "The Pac-10 did a great job of getting us ready for this,"
Christoffersen said. "The Pac-10 has really made us strong, playing
against a lot of really tough teams and so many close games. We had
to grind it out all season and we never got flustered tonight. We
just kept grinding it out."</TE>
<TE>   Oregon hasn't won this many games in a single NCAA tournament
since winning the title in 1939. "We are really close to something
special," Ridnour said. "And I love playing with these guys. This is
fun."</TE>

<HD>Kansas Wins Survival Game</HD>
<DH>Midwest: Illinois misses two open shots in final 26
seconds, allowing top-seeded Jayhawks to escape with 73-69 win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MADISON, Wis.</DL>
<LD>Brian Cook will lose sleep over this, over the wide-open
three-pointer he had with 26 seconds left that would have given
Illinois the lead.</LD>
<LD>   Frank Williams will close his eyes and see the wide-open baseline
jumper he rimmed out with six seconds left, the one that would have
tied the score. Williams will see that ball do its dizzy dance around
the rim and he will not wish to see the ball come out of the basket.</LD>
<LD>   Roy Williams will hold his breath again as he replays the final
two minutes of this basketball game, the one it seemed his Kansas
Jayhawks had secured when they led by 10 points with five minutes
left; by five points with 2:28; and by the breathless centimeter
off-center that Frank Williams' final shot landed.</LD>
<TE>   Kansas, the No. 1-seeded team in the Midwest Regional, beat No.
4-seeded Illinois, 73-69, Friday night at the Kohl Center. The
Jayhawks (32-3) will play No. 2 Oregon on Sunday with the winner
earning a berth in the Final Four.</TE>
<TE>   Having gone undefeated in the wickedly tough Big 12 Conference
regular season, the Jayhawks began the tournament with high hopes and
high expectations.</TE>
<TE>   This is the 13th time Williams has taken Kansas into the
tournament. This is the fifth time the Jayhawks have been seeded No.
1.</TE>
<TE>   And what Williams is missing isn't a trip to the Final Four (he
has made two of those). It is the title Williams is still chasing.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever happens," Williams said after Friday's win, "I am the
luckiest guy in the world to have this job with these kids."</TE>
<TE>   Sweat had collected under Williams' chin and dripped from his
nose. Even for the coach, this game was exhausting.</TE>
<TE>   The game was played at a desperate pace between teams desperate,
in their own ways, for redemption. Kansas had been bitterly
disappointed in its 80-64 loss to Illinois in this same round a year
ago. Illinois (26-9) had been bitterly disappointed in a relatively
lackluster regular season after high preseason rankings and an Elite
Eight run last year.</TE>
<TE>   About seven minutes into the game, Kansas had seven baskets and
seven fouls. Blood dripped off Cook's arm.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of big bodies colliding around," Kansas forward
Nick Collison said. "Nobody was going to give an inch and nobody was
afraid to take a hit. Or give one."</TE>
<TE>   Always Kansas was just a little ahead. The Jayhawks jumped out
quickly, 10-3, and that early advantage was so valuable.</TE>
<TE>   Even when they had early foul trouble--starting forward Collison
had two fouls in the first 2:23 and starting guard Kirk Hinrich had
his second with 14:35 left--the Jayhawks stayed aggressive and mostly
stayed ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois had three one-point leads in the first half, but by
halftime Kansas led, 40-34, with thanks to freshman Aaron Miles and
his leaning, grimacing 10-footer at the buzzer. The lead grew to as
many as 10 points, but Kansas could never quite shake the Illini.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of free throws here, a couple of offensive rebounds
there, a three-pointer by reserve Sean Harrington to make the score
69-64, a tip-in by Illinois center Robert Archibald to make the score
71-68, some Kansas misses, a free throw by Archibald to make the
score 71-69 and, Roy Williams said, "all of a sudden my stomach was
jumping."</TE>
<TE>   Of his three-point attempt, Cook said, "I should have made that
shot."</TE>
<TE>   Of his final try, Frank Williams said, "I had an open look."</TE>
<TE>   But the effort of the evening was just a little too much. Cook and
Williams had nothing left.</TE>

<HD>Carter, Iverson Done for Season</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hours after the Toronto Raptors found out that Vince Carter will be
lost for the season because of knee surgery, two other Eastern
Conference teams watched their stars fall to injuries.</LD>
<LD>   Allen Iverson of the Philadelphia 76ers and Tracy McGrady of the
Orlando Magic both were hurt during games Friday with Iverson
possibly out for the season after breaking a bone in his left hand.</LD>
<LD>   "It's four to six weeks so I'd imagine he's done," 76er Coach
Larry Brown said. "The kid is playing as good as anyone. You just
don't replace him."</LD>
<TE>   McGrady was carted off on a stretcher after going down with severe
back spasms in the second quarter of Orlando's 106-92 loss to the
Charlotte Hornets. The Magic will not have him back until next week
at the earliest, Coach Doc Rivers said.</TE>
<TE>   An MRI exam and X-rays taken at Florida Hospital were negative,
although McGrady was to remain there overnight.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Friday, the Raptors learned that Carter, their leading
scorer, will have surgery on his left knee next week and be sidelined
for the rest of the regular season with the team almost certain to
miss the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to continue to give it all I could. My goal is to be
there for the team, but I couldn't do it and be myself," Carter said.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson, the league's leading scorer at 31.5 points per game, did
not play in the second half of Philadelphia's 96-91 victory over
Boston.</TE>

<LD>Michelle Kwan created a big obstacle for herself Friday in the World
Figure Skating Championships at Nagano, Japan, when she stumbled out
of a combination jump in the short program and landed in third place.</LD>
<LD>   Now she trails Russian rival Irina Slutskaya and Japanese favorite
Fumie Sugari entering tonight's finale, the free skate.</LD>
<LD>   Yoshie Onda of Japan was fourth, with Sasha Cohen of the United
States fifth.</LD>
<TE>   For Kwan to win her third consecutive world championship and fifth
overall, she needs to win the free skating and have someone else
defeat Slutskaya, as well.</TE>
<TE>   A jump from third is not out of the question, though. At the
Olympics, Sarah Hughes leaped from fourth to upset Slutskaya and Kwan
to take the gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan stumbled out of her triple lutz in the first part of a
combination jump. For that, she received technical marks between 5.2
and 5.4, very low for the four-time world champion.</TE>
<TE>   Slutskaya was flawless in her routine, earning two perfect 6.0s
for presentation to a Schubert melody. With a high triple lutz
entering her combination, she also was the best of the afternoon for
required elements, with all 5.8s or 5.9s.</TE>

<TE>   Jeff Gordon took the top qualifying spot, setting a track record
by running a lap at 127.216 mph at Bristol Motor Speedway in
Tennessee. It was the 40th pole of his career and his first since
August.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon, who won his fourth Winston Cup championship last season,
broke Steve Park's mark of 126.370 mph set in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Scott Riggs had no trouble making his first trip around
Bristol Motor Speedway, setting a record in winning the pole for the
Channellock 250. Riggs ran a lap around the 0.533-mile ring at
126.270 mph, breaking the Busch series record of 125.264 set by Kevin
Harvick last year.</TE>

<TE>   A jury found the defensive lineman guilty Wednesday of attempting

bust at a motel.</TE>
<TE>   Manley, 43, had said he was innocent. He remained free on $20,000

sentencing is April 5.</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota Vikings were denied their request to move a wrongful
death lawsuit by Korey Stringer's family from Minneapolis to Mankato.</TE>

the player's parents. A trial date has not been set.</TE>

Biscayne, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Chela, whose ranking has been rising since he returned last summer
from a three-month suspension for using a banned steroid, moved into
the third round.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Andre Agassi, seeded ninth, won a match
suspended twice because of rain, beating Greg Rusedski, 6-3, 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   Eighth-seeded Serena Williams also won her opening match, but not
without drawing jeers from the crowd. With American Lilia Osterloh
serving two points from winning the first set at 5-4, 30-30, a light
rain prompted Williams to ask chair umpire Anne Lasserre-Ullrich
about halting play.</TE>
<TE>   Osterloh wanted to continue, but Lasserre-Ullrich stopped the
match for five minutes. Fans booed, and when play resumed and
Williams won the next two points, they booed again.</TE>
<TE>   Williams won, 7-5, 6-1. Third-seeded Martina Hingis advanced more
routinely, beating Janet Lee, 6-1, 6-0.</TE>

<TE>   Aaron Peirsol of Irvine won his second and third titles of the

<TE>   Peirsol, 18, won the 100-meter backstroke in 54.47 seconds, and
teamed with Daniel Hewko, Scott Tucker and Michael Cavic to take the
800 freestyle relay. Earlier in the week, Peirsol set a world record
in the 200 backstroke.</TE>
<TE>   University of Miami running back Frank Gore had surgery to repair
ligaments in his right knee and could be ready to play in the fall.
Gore, who ran for 562 yards and five touchdowns last season as a
freshman for the national champion Hurricanes, was injured Tuesday
during spring practice.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa State's Cael Sanderson, trying to become the first collegiate

<DH>College football: After a recruiting season to forget,
Pac-10 coaches try to patch up differences.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least one blue-chip recruit watched in bemusement last month as
football coaches from the Pacific 10 Conference pointed fingers and
traded barbs.</LD>
<LD>   The controversy focused mainly on negative recruiting, the attempt
to sway a prospect by bad-mouthing the other schools on his list.
Washington complained about UCLA and Oregon. Arizona blamed
California. The accused fired back.</LD>
<LD>   Lorenzo Booker figures he knows something about the subject. The
running back from Ventura St. Bonaventure High was courted by every
major program in the nation and, to him, it seemed, "they all talked
trash about each other."</LD>
<TE>   Though Booker might be overstating the facts, it will be
interesting to see what, if anything, the Pac-10 does about the
recent allegations.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the grumbling has taken a backseat to spring football
practice, which begins at USC today and at UCLA on April 2. But
lingering resentments should make for lively conversation when the
coaches gather for their annual meeting late next month.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of pressure in recruiting and nerves get frayed,"
assistant commissioner Jim Muldoon said. "They need to sit down, look
each other in the eye and deal with this."</TE>
<TE>   The question is, what exactly happened? And can anyone agree on
what comes next?</TE>
<TE>   The trouble started with an unusually tense recruiting season in
which many prospects remained undecided until the last moment or, in
some cases, promised themselves to one school but changed their minds
and signed with another.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Coach Rick Neuheisel fired the first salvo after losing
defensive lineman Chris Solomona and cornerback Mike Davis Jr. to
conference rivals. Other Pac-10 coaches were taken aback when they
heard his allegations through the media.</TE>
<TE>   "We should have kept it in-house," UCLA Coach Bob Toledo said.
"But once a person goes public, the other person has to defend
himself."</TE>
<TE>   The conference reprimanded Neuheisel and Toledo, who had responded
with a counter-accusation, for lashing out. Then officials launched
an investigation, saying that any team guilty of negative recruiting
could face minor penalties, though such allegations are difficult to
prove and no one could recall the last time a program was punished
for the offense.</TE>
<TE>   To make matters trickier, Neuheisel also complained that rival
schools had hounded prospects who'd made oral commitments to
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Under NCAA regulations, a recruit can state his preference for a
school but the commitment is not binding until he signs a letter of
intent, which he may not do until early February. In the meantime,
nothing prohibits other schools from continuing to recruit him.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona Coach John Mackovic, who received an oral commitment from
receiver David Gray, then lost him to California, sees an ethical
minefield.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're in a tight recruiting pitch and the player doesn't
really make a strong statement to anybody, it's going to go back and
forth," Mackovic said. "But when a player has indicated to everybody
that he is firmly committed and someone comes in a month later, I
find that distasteful.</TE>
<TE>   "And if they say negative things, then it becomes unethical."</TE>
<TE>   Coaches agree that making one more call, if only to gauge a
player's resolve, is reasonable. Beyond that, opinions vary on how
long and hard to push. Often the pressure increases after an oral
commitment.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the other schools know who the enemy is," said John Lilly,
the Florida State recruiting coordinator who beat out USC and
Washington for Booker's services.</TE>
<TE>   The situation arises more frequently as coaches seek early
commitments, hoping to line up recruiting classes in advance. Players
have added to the confusion with a new trend toward making oral
commitments but continuing to take recruiting trips.</TE>
<TE>   At UCLA, Toledo won't accept such deals. Other coaches don't mind.</TE>
<TE>   "People commit and de-commit all the time," Oregon Coach Mike
Bellotti said. "We understand it's not over until they sign on the
dotted line."</TE>
<TE>   Bellotti knows what he is talking about, having received an oral
commitment from Long Beach Poly running back Hershel Dennis less than
24 hours before signing day. When it came time to fax a letter of
intent the next morning, Dennis switched to USC.</TE>
<TE>   The Oregon coach said he bears no ill will and, at the other end
of the deal, USC Coach Pete Carroll believes prospects should talk to
multiple programs until the last moment if they have any doubt about
where they want to go.</TE>
<TE>   "They have earned that right," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Mackovic worries that some players are being pressured into
switching. He would like to see an early signing date, say in
December, so players who have decided on a school can complete the
deal and avoid further calls from recruiters. Toledo would go even
farther, pushing the date to August.</TE>
<TE>   This sort of talk confounds Carroll, who says, "Either you're
competing for recruits or you're not."</TE>
<TE>   Along that line of thinking, Pac-10 coaches acknowledge this might
have been the year the conference became truly competitive. Gone are
the days when two or three programs ruled the roost. Now, with seven
Pac-10 teams having gone to the Rose Bowl in the last eight seasons,
the struggle has spilled beyond the field.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all going after the same kids," Bellotti said. "Every team
that has gone to the Rose Bowl the last few years probably thinks
they have a shot at the best kids on the West Coast."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo has noticed the difference, too. "When I was at Oregon, we
never recruited against USC and UCLA as much as they are doing now,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   So what does this mean for the coaches meeting next month?</TE>
<TE>   Mackovic worries that everyone might "bring a bag of stones to
throw at each other" but Toledo is more optimistic, hoping that he
and his cohorts can clear the air.</TE>
<TE>   Bellotti would rather focus on spring practice.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll be fun to get back to football," he said.</TE>

<LD>High school baseball players can immediately begin using titanium
bats that meet the ball exit speed ratio performance, the National
Federation of State High School Assns. announced Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Titanium bats had been banned this season. The organization's
baseball rules committee voted last June that all non-wood bats must
have a BESR certification mark to be legal for high school baseball
effective Jan. 1, 2003.</LD>
<LD>   Since many bats with the BESR standard are already on the market,
the rules committee voted to allow those bats to be used immediately.</LD>

<LD>Geno Auriemma and Rene Portland, whose Connecticut and Penn State
teams play today in an NCAA women's Mideast Regional semifinal, don't
bite their tongues or hide behind platitudes. So they didn't exchange
fake air kisses or arm's-length hugs here at media day.</LD>
<LD>   Whether it's in Ames, Iowa; Boise, Idaho, or Raleigh, N.C., at the
women's tournament the talk is worth listening to. No bland,
we're-here-to-play-our-best, mind-numbing, cliche-spouting coaches'
session here.</LD>
<LD>   Two of the four No. 1-seeded teams in the women's tournament are
coached by men. Auriemma leads undefeated Connecticut, and Jim Foster
coaches Vanderbilt. They are Philadelphia guys, gym rats raised on
basketball courts. They started coaching grade-school girls' teams
because they just wanted to coach. And they are always beleaguered
this time of year.</LD>
<TE>   They love their jobs and don't want to "move up" to a men's team.
"Why would I want that?" Auriemma says. "All the hassles."</TE>
<TE>   The issue doesn't go away, though. Should men be coaching women's
basketball teams? After all, women aren't coaching men's teams. But
shouldn't the better person get the job, any job? Don't we want our
women's teams coached as well as possible?</TE>
<TE>   That's what Auriemma says. Don't you want your athletic daughter
to receive the very best in coaching, in motivation, in strategy, in
drills, in everything? If two candidates for a job are equal,
Auriemma says, fine, hire the woman. But if they are not, don't you
hire the best? And if that's a man, what's the problem?</TE>
<TE>   The problem, says Portland, is that she could be the best
candidate for the Penn State men's job and she would not get that
job. Not now, not ever.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't happen; it won't happen," Portland says.</TE>
<TE>   For two years now, several high-profile men's coaches, among them
Auriemma, Foster and Georgia's Andy Landers, have suggested that the
women's NCAA tournament committee has stacked certain regions with
most of the male coaches, hoping the men will knock each other off.</TE>
<TE>   Horsefeathers, says Portland.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a false issue and it's wrong," she says.</TE>
<TE>   What's not right, says Portland, is the way men have become more
interested in women's jobs as women's programs have grown in prestige
and remuneration. It's an issue of fairness, says Portland. Where is
the equal opportunity for women in the men's coaching profession?
There is none.</TE>
<TE>   Horsefeathers, says Auriemma. Do women want men's jobs? Then get
qualified.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just about the coaching," Auriemma says. "It's about the
recruiting, the contacts, all that stuff."</TE>
<TE>   If women want to coach men's college basketball, Auriemma says,
they should do what he did.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach boys' grade-school basketball," Auriemma says. "Move up to
junior high. Get an assistant's job in high school. Then a head job.
I was making $400 a year coaching junior high girls and had to have
two other jobs on the side."</TE>
<TE>   If this seems like so much "he said, she said," it wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   What is refreshing is that two adults were willing to speak
passionately about a real issue, a controversial topic. There is
nothing politically correct about women's college basketball.</TE>
<TE>   Auriemma says he's tired of hearing how men are getting all the
good jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "Men get jobs at programs that are in the dumper," Auriemma says.</TE>
<TE>   And if the women don't want men coaching women, "Why," Auriemma
asks, "do so many women head coaches hire men as assistants? We're
good enough to be assistants but not head coaches?</TE>
<TE>   "Let's just be fair. Let's give the best-qualified person the
job."</TE>
<TE>   Diana Taurasi, Connecticut's sophomore guard from Chino and the
nation's top recruit two years ago, says she has always played for
male coaches and always wants to.</TE>
<TE>   "Being coached by a woman would be like having my mom yell at me
all the time," Taurasi says.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Bird, Taurasi's All-American backcourt mate, says she'd play
for a man or woman but adds, "I know a lot of players who wanted to
play for a man."</TE>
<TE>   What's hard to argue is that Auriemma has built the dominant
women's program in the country. He has passed Tennessee's Pat
Summitt. Connecticut is on every top recruit's must-visit list.</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies are 35-0 and have won by an average of 37 points a
game this season. What bothers Auriemma more than the sniping about
men having women's jobs or women ghettoizing the men coaches in
regional draws is, he says, that women athletes aren't being pushed
harder.</TE>
<TE>   There is grumbling that Connecticut's excellence and dominance is
hurting the game, taking away interest, sucking the life from the
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   That's silly, Auriemma says, and he's right.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with women's basketball is not that Connecticut is so
good but that other teams aren't good enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Too many coaches don't push women as hard as men are pushed," he
says. "When I play basketball in the driveway with my son, I knock
him around, I rub his face in the dirt. With a girl, if a pitch hits
her in the chin, you run out and take her for ice cream and hope her
mother doesn't get mad at you.</TE>
<TE>   "When people look at us, I would want them to make their programs
better. Push the women. Why would you coach girls different then you
would coach boys? Expect the same things from them, coach them the
same way."</TE>
<TE>   And there's the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Who cares whether a team is coached by a man or woman? Just care
about trying to be Connecticut.</TE>

<HD>Ronning a Novelty, Not a Short Story</HD>
<DH>Hockey: New King was once considered too small, at 5 feet
8, to last in the NHL, but that was 16 years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The good news for Cliff Ronning is that, after 15 seasons in the NHL,
he no longer hears questions about whether he's too small to last.</LD>
<LD>   The bad news is, now some wonder whether he's too old.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a never-ending battle," said the 5-foot-8, 165-pound
Ronning, a 36-year-old left wing acquired by the Kings last week in a
trade with the Nashville Predators. "But I think it has helped me to
make sure I'm always ready to play.</LD>
<TE>   "It motivates me."</TE>
<TE>   Among the most minuscule of the league's mighty mites, Ronning has
been proving his doubters wrong since, as a ninth-round draft pick,
he made his NHL debut with the St. Louis Blues in a playoff game 16
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   On the night that he scored his first regular-season goal, against
the Minnesota North Stars on Jan. 12, 1987, he scored two more for a
hat trick.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, after helping the Vancouver Canucks reach the Stanley Cup
finals, he played in the Game 7 loss to the New York Rangers despite
a broken hand.</TE>
<TE>   And although many had said he would never play in the NHL, Ronning
played in his 1,000th game two weeks ago. Joe Sakic of the Colorado
Avalanche also played in his 1,000th game that day, the two natives
of the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby, Canada, joining only 175 other
players who have reached the milestone in the league's 84-year
history.</TE>
<TE>   All-Star center Jeremy Roenick of the Philadelphia Flyers,
Ronning's teammate and roommate for two-plus seasons with the Phoenix
Coyotes, calls him "probably one of the true freaks of nature that
there are in sports today.</TE>
<TE>   "How can you have a guy who is 5-6, 5-7 or whatever he is and
dominate a hockey game like he does?" Roenick said in an interview
with the Nashville Tennessean. "He's tremendously skilled and
tremendously poised for being a little guy."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings think so too.</TE>
<TE>   Ronning's next goal or assist will give him his 11th 50-point
season, and the Kings would love for it to come in today's Staples
Center showdown against the Pacific Division-leading San Jose Sharks.</TE>
<TE>   One reason they gave up defenseman Jere Karalahti and a 2003 draft
pick for Ronning was the winger's statistics against some of the best
teams in the Western Conference: 42 points in 42 games against the
Avalanche, 50 in 64 against the Detroit Red Wings, 55 in 54 against
the Sharks.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and this one too: 76 points in 101 playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   "To be his size and play that long, you've got to have some
character, and he's going to bring that to the team," new teammate
Ian Laperriere said. "And once we get into the playoffs, he's going
to be a big part of it, a big leader.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great trade."</TE>
<TE>   Ronning, though, wasn't so sure. He looked like the new kid in
school this week, uncomfortable and full of doubt as he adjusted to
his new surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   "Talking with him, no matter how long you've been in the league,
you come to a new team and you've got the butterflies," Coach Andy
Murray said. "I think it's like anybody changing jobs; your first day
on the job is difficult."</TE>
<TE>   The truth is, Ronning didn't want to change jobs.</TE>
<TE>   He and his family--wife Ivana, son Ty and daughters Taryn and
Kristin--were happily settled in Nashville. David Poile, the
Predators' general manager, said that Ronning was in such great shape
that he could probably play until he's 40. Coach Barry Trotz marveled
that Ronning could "stickhandle in a phone booth."</TE>
<TE>   Two seasons ago, Ronning scored 26 goals, only three short of his
career high. This season, he led the Predators with 18 goals and 31
assists.</TE>
<TE>   But with the fourth-year expansion team out of the playoff picture
again this spring, the Predators decided they needed younger players.</TE>
<TE>   Three days before Tuesday's trade deadline, King General Manager
Dave Taylor won the bidding for Ronning, reportedly over five teams.</TE>
<TE>   The trade stung Ronning, fueling his initial anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   Once the shock wore off, however, he quickly warmed to the idea of
playing for a contender. After almost four years in Nashville, where
he was the Predators' leading scorer each season but he and his
teammates were spectators come playoff time, he had forgotten what it
was like to play meaningful games this time of year.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I got settled here, I realized that the opportunities here
are great, such as playing in the playoffs," said Ronning, who had
never before played with any of his new teammates. "That's why you
play the game. And once you have that opportunity, you get excited. I
feel very fortunate to be here. But when it first happens, you don't
see it that way....</TE>
<TE>   "You know, coming in and meeting new guys is tough. Usually after
so many years, you would know somebody you played with, but everyone
[here] I played against. But they know me as a player and I know
them.</TE>
<TE>   "And what an opportunity. It's something in the back of my mind,
playing against L.A. all those years, I always wanted to know what it
would be like to play in such a great city. And now I get that
chance."</TE>
<TE>   Long story short: The Kings hope he makes the most of it.</TE>

<HD>Kent State Finds Itself in a Prime Location</HD>

<DL>LEXINGTON, Ky.</DL>
<LD>You can talk about underdogs and how Villanova's great upset of
Georgetown in the 1985 NCAA title game happened right here in Rupp
Arena.</LD>
<LD>   Or you can simply understand this: Kent State can make it to the
Final Four because all it has to do is beat Indiana today, a team it
upset in the first round of the NCAA tournament last year.</LD>
<LD>   If the Golden Flashes win the NCAA South Regional final today,
they will be the most improbable team to reach the Final Four since
Pennsylvania in 1979--and as a 10th-seeded team, the lowest-seeded
since No. 11 Louisiana State in 1986.</LD>
<TE>   So it's Kent State with a longshot's chance against a Goliath that
has won five NCAA titles?</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly: Indiana is a mere 31/2-point favorite over a school
yearning to be known for more than the 1970 National Guard shootings
that killed four students during an antiwar protest.</TE>
<TE>   Kent State (30-5) made its first big splash in the NCAA tournament
when it beat Indiana last season in the first round of the NCAA West
Regional at San Diego, 77-73.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, that was our shining moment," said guard Trevor
Huffman, the offense-minded guard who was considering playing
Division II or Division III basketball until Kent State gave him his
only major college offer after he'd played pickup games in what
amounted to a tryout for his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the Golden Flashes have had several shining moments,
and they're after a few more.</TE>
<TE>   "I know Oklahoma State, Alabama and Pittsburgh didn't know what
they were getting into, but we do," Indiana Coach Mike Davis said.
"It's going to be a tough basketball game. These guys know that."</TE>
<TE>   Indiana (23-11) pulled the biggest upset of the tournament
Thursday when it made up a 17-point deficit and beat defending
national champion Duke.</TE>
<TE>   The Hoosiers are trying to return to the Final Four for the first
time since 1992 and haven't won an NCAA title since 1987.</TE>
<TE>   These teams have changed since last year.</TE>
<TE>   Jared Jeffries, Indiana's sophomore star, for instance, was a meek
freshman forward who scored only nine points in last season's game.</TE>
<TE>   Center Kirk Haston scored 29 despite an ankle injury in his final
game, and guard Tom Coverdale played with a hip injury.</TE>
<TE>   But Kent State is a better team too.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Huffman, who scored 24 points in last season's game, the
Golden Flashes have fellow senior guards Andrew Mitchell and Demetric
Shaw.</TE>
<TE>   And they have added junior forward Antonio Gates--a 6-foot-5,
240-pound former football player who attended three colleges before
Kent State.</TE>
<TE>   There are scores to settle too.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana guard Dane Fife is still miffed at a quote by Huffman
saying Fife's father, a high school coach, thought Huffman would make
a nice Division III player.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that sticks with me about Kent State is, my dad
got ripped by one of their players in Sports Illustrated," Fife said.
"I think that's a good motivational tool for me."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Lands a Staple of Women's Game</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Season-ending WTA championships, staged in Munich
last year, will move to Staples Center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The WTA's Board of Directors voted Friday to hold the premier
season-ending women's tennis tournament in Southern California for
the first time, moving the WTA championships from their one-year
stopover in Munich, Germany, to Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   An often-fractious process marked by territorial disputes
culminated in a vote to transfer the event by the 10-member board
after a lengthy meeting in Miami.</LD>
<LD>   Details of the deal were still being worked out late Friday, but
Staples Center officials anticipate the $3-million championships will
conclude the first week in November. Tim Leiweke, president of
Anschutz Entertainment Group and Staples Center, expects the event to
be held at the downtown arena for a couple of years.</LD>
<TE>   Another potential option is literally down the road: AEG has
started construction on a $120-million sports complex in Carson,
which will include a tennis stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to take a look at how it's doing [at Staples]," said
Leiweke. "And whether or not we want to look at doing other things
with it or keeping it here. So there are some mutual options."</TE>
<TE>   The event was held in New York before it was moved to Munich last
year. When interest in returning the championships to the U.S. was
raised, Leiweke made the bid to bring the event to Staples. While
many on the tour support the site change, its biggest opponent has
been International Management Group, which represents players and
runs its own tournaments: In Southern California, IMG is a partner at
Indian Wells and owns the Manhattan Beach women's event.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Kain, president and chief operating officer of IMG, said
Thursday that the company would "keep fighting" the move, contending
there are too many women's events in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke and the event's rights-holder, Octagon, argued that the
addition of the championships would enhance the other events, not
detract from them.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at the new stars coming along with the existing stars in
women's tennis," Leiweke said. "This is their championship event. I
think we have an opportunity here to take that to the next level.
That is not a knock on what's happened in the last year or so. In
L.A. we do very well with big star-driven events.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a long process, but sometimes good things take a long
time," Leiweke added. "This is an example of something worth fighting
for. It's on the scale of the Grammys, the NBA or NHL All-Star games.
This has the opportunity and should be considered one of the best
sporting events in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Wulff, the WTA's chief executive officer, was not available
for comment because many of the details, including the final dates,
were still being worked out in subsequent meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke said credit for the move must also go to the players, a
key force behind the effort. One of the compelling reasons to return
the championships to the United States was Monica Seles, who was
stabbed in Germany in 1993. She said she will never play there again
and wanted to finish her career competing in the championships.</TE>
<TE>   "This is another example of how we're going to re-center tennis to
Southern California," said Kevin O'Connor, executive director of AEG
tennis. "I'm very pleased that the Staples Center will be able to
showcase women's tennis, and I couldn't personally be more happy for
Monica Seles."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn was also involved. He wrote a letter to the
WTA in support and is recruiting the organization as it considers a
possible move of its headquarters to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor, to his credit, went out and found potential office
space," Leiweke said. "He found some office space downtown and said,
'We want your offices here and I'm prepared to work for it.'"</TE>

<HD>Quizzers of Westwood Looking for Answers</HD>
<DH>UCLA: Will Kapono go to the NBA this time? Will Lavin go
anywhere? Who will succeed Dalis as athletic director?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>With such trivial distractions as practices and games finally out of
the way, let the off-season intrigue begin.</LD>
<LD>   A perfectly ordinary UCLA basketball season--up-and-down regular
season followed by Sweet 16 appearance--already has given way to
conjecture about the job status of Coach Steve Lavin and NBA value of
junior forward Jason Kapono.</LD>
<LD>   One day after the Bruins were eliminated from the NCAA tournament
by Missouri, a national radio show reported that DePaul officials
asked UCLA for permission to speak with Lavin.</LD>
<TE>   Untrue, Bruin administrators said.</TE>
<TE>   At least for now.</TE>
<TE>   Lavin has entertained the idea of bolting the well-chronicled
pressures of UCLA for a more lucrative deal elsewhere, but he is
excited about next year's team. And the school is sweetening the
terms of his buyout, which pretty much eliminates the possibility
that he will be fired for the crime of leading the Bruins to six
consecutive 20-victory seasons and NCAA tournament appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly he is safe until an athletic director is hired to
replace Pete Dalis, who will resign in June. A search committee
headed by Vice Chancellor Pete Blackman is expected to whittle down
seven candidates to three or four finalists in the next few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Although UCLA spokesman Marc Dellins declined to confirm the
candidates, sources said the list includes Dalis assistants Betsy
Stephenson and Rick Purdy, along with five athletic directors at
other schools: Gene Bleymaier of Boise State, Gary Walters of
Princeton, Dan Guerrero of UC Irvine, Gary Cunningham of UC Santa
Barbara and Rick Bay of San Diego State.</TE>
<TE>   Lavin isn't losing sleep over the identity of his next boss. He
plans to take his parents to Cancun to celebrate their 50th
anniversary in May, a rare break from the nonstop grind of recruiting
and other off-season duties.</TE>
<TE>   "The job never ends and that's one of the challenges," he said.
"There is a lot of work to do."</TE>
<TE>   Convincing Kapono to return is at the top of the to-do list. This
is the third season the school's all-time three-point shooter has
weighed jumping to the NBA, and this time the decision will be very
difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to take two weeks off, then I'll start thinking about
it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If scouts convince him he will be a first-round draft choice, he's
gone. If he gets no such guarantee, he probably will return because
there are valid reasons to do so. He wants to win a championship, is
cognizant of his climb through the Bruin record book and is devoted
to his girlfriend, a UCLA sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   Kapono's comments after the loss indicate he associates himself
with next season's team.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the reason for our Sweet 16 losses the last few years is
that we just haven't made the plays down the stretch," he said. "We
are going to have to do that to get past that hump."</TE>
<TE>   Lavin also must keep tabs on the classroom progress of freshmen
Cedric Bozeman, Dijon Thompson and Andre Patterson. Despite the
positive influence of fifth-year seniors Billy Knight and Rico Hines,
who have already graduated, the freshmen adjusted to college work
with varying degrees of success.</TE>
<TE>   And there might be shuffling on the coaching staff. Jim Saia,
Lavin's top assistant and longtime close friend, will interview for
the head job at Fresno State next week. Former Bruin guard Gerald
Madkins was popular with players in his first season as an assistant
and third assistant Patrick Sandle is a former San Francisco State
teammate of Lavin.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting on the season won't take long. Sure, the memories of
seniors Matt Barnes and Dan Gadzuric stepping up in the tournament
and of Knight and Hines becoming solid contributors are worth
savoring.</TE>
<TE>   But a 21-12 record, sixth-place Pacific 10 Conference finish,
first-round exit in the conference tournament and Sweet 16
elimination was not the legacy the team wanted to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Next season will begin with goals of a championship, any
championship. The talent, as always, will be in place.</TE>
<TE>   Returning along with Bozeman, Thompson and Patterson will be post
player T.J. Cummings and point guard Ryan Walcott, giving the Bruins
an athletic, experienced nucleus. Veteran guards Ray Young and Jon
Crispin will be eligible and incoming freshman Evan Burns is a
blue-chip prospect.</TE>
<TE>   Will Kapono be in the mix? Will Saia? Lavin? And who will oversee
the program from the athletic director's office in the Morgan Center?</TE>
<TE>   Answers will come during the off-season, when intrigue is often at
its highest.</TE>

<HD>Price Knows the Full Scoop on Missouri</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Hollis Price kept a folded newspaper article in his shoe as
inspiration during Oklahoma's blowout win over Arizona on Thursday
night. The Sooner junior guard had taken exception to a printed
comment made by Wildcat freshman Salim Stoudamire, who had wondered
why Price was being revered in the press.</LD>
<LD>   Price scored 22 points and six three-point baskets in the first
half before finishing with a game-high 26 points in the Sooners'
88-67 win.</LD>
<LD>   So, what's Price's inspiration for today against Big 12
Conference-rival Missouri in the West Regional final at Compaq
Center?</LD>
<TE>   "A trip to the Final Four," he said. "That's it."</TE>
<TE>   Beat the No. 12-seeded Tigers and that's where the No. 2-seeded
Sooners are going for the first time since losing the 1988 title game
to Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   It would seem a simple enough task, considering Oklahoma (30-4)
has defeated Missouri (24-11) eight consecutive times, including
84-71 in Norman, Okla., on Jan. 21.</TE>
<TE>   "[But] the law of averages might be our best advantage," joked
third-year Missouri Coach Quin Snyder, who is 0-5 against the
Sooners. "Someone beats you enough, eventually you've got to win....
When you get down to it, it's not about losing streaks or the Big 12
[having two teams in a regional final]. It's about two teams squaring
off."</TE>
<TE>   The Sooners have an 11-game winning streak and have won 15 of 16.
The surprising Tigers, the lowest-seeded team ever to reach the Elite
Eight, have defeated their three NCAA tournament opponents by an
average of 12.6 points.</TE>
<TE>   In Oklahoma's win earlier this season, Missouri senior Clarence
Gilbert, still adjusting to his role as point guard, scored a
game-high 26 points while making eight three-pointers. Price led the
Sooners with 24 points, five three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   The Sooners have defeated Missouri by an average of 7.9 points
during their eight-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened in the past and what we did to them in the past
means nothing," said Oklahoma Coach Kelvin Sampson. "Look at Duke.
Everybody assumes, but there's nothing guaranteed anybody."</TE>

<LD>Duke Is Duked</LD>
<LD>   Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski has a Wooden-esque nine Final Four
appearances and three national championships in 22 seasons, but here
are his not-so-elite eight NCAA tournament moments--including
Thursday's stunning 74-73 loss to Indiana:</LD>
<LD>   1987</LD>
<TE>   Round of 16, Midwest Regional</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 Indiana 88, No. 5 Duke 82</TE>
<TE>   * Krzyzewski didn't enjoy going against mentor Bob Knight.</TE>
<TE>   1993</TE>
<TE>   Second Round, Midwest Regional</TE>
<TE>   No. 6 California 82, No. 3 Duke 77</TE>
<TE>   * A year after winning a second consecutive national championship,
the Blue Devils are unceremoniously bounced from the tournament by
Jason Kidd and Co.</TE>
<TE>   1996</TE>
<TE>   First Round, Southeast Regional</TE>
<TE>   No. 9 Eastern Mich. 75, No. 8 Duke 60</TE>
<TE>   * The Blue Devils, coming off an 13-18 season, and Krzyzewski,
coming off back surgery, were both on the mend, giving Eastern
Michigan's little big man (and future Clipper) Earl Boykins a chance
to slice and dice his way to 23 points.</TE>
<TE>   1997</TE>
<TE>   Second Round, Southeast Regional</TE>
<TE>   No. 10 Providence 98, No. 2 Duke 87</TE>
<TE>   * The Blue Devils seemed to be rounding back into national-power
form, but in this game the power was with Austin Croshere and the
Friars.</TE>
<TE>   1998</TE>
<TE>   Round of Eight, South Regional</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 Kentucky 86, No. 1 Duke 84</TE>
<TE>   * The Wildcats get some revenge for Christian Laettner's
game-winning shot at the buzzer in 1992 East Regional final,
overcoming a 18-point deficit.</TE>
<TE>   1999</TE>
<TE>   National championship game</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut 77, Duke 74</TE>
<TE>   * More payback by a Blue Devil opponent for a Laettner
game-winning shot (1990 East Regional final). Richard Hamilton lets
'er rip for 27 points as Huskies prevent Duke from finishing with the
most victories in an NCAA Division I season.</TE>
<TE>   2000</TE>
<TE>   Round of 16, East Regional</TE>
<TE>   No. 5 Florida 87, No. 1 Duke 78</TE>
<TE>   * The Blue Devils learn what power of the press is all about,
wilting under Florida's full-court pressure.</TE>
<TE>   2002</TE>
<TE>   Round of 16, South Regional</TE>
<TE>   No. 5 Indiana 74, No. 1 Duke 73</TE>
<TE>   * Blue Devils' stunning loss has movie studios scrambling to be
first in line for "Hoosiers II."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<LD>In Grahame Jones' March 20 article ["Legal Fight Simply a Joke"], he
argues that the U.S. Soccer Federation should be free to restrict the
leading international foreign teams from playing in matches that may
compete with those of the Galaxy and other Major League Soccer teams.
He supports his case by demeaning most soccer fans and encouraging
blatant anti-competitive conduct.</LD>
<LD>   Jones insults the fans when he says that having already spent
money on our Tuesday match featuring Chivas and Pumas, they would be
unable to pay to attend tonight's Galaxy game. Most fans would prefer
to attend the match of their choice, not Jones'. But for the sake of
argument, supposing there was a segment of the populace that did have
to choose, would it have been "reasonable," as Jones asserts, to
withhold approval of a match the soccer fans wanted to see, merely
because it might have an effect on attendance for MLS? Would it not
be more "reasonable" to allow free enterprise to exist unfettered and
let the consumers decide what event they would like to attend?</LD>
<TE>   In contrast to what Jones believes, the Coliseum Commission's
lawsuit has nothing to do with financial survival or the pending
construction of a competing facility in Carson. And anti-competitive
restrictions challenged by the suit have resulted in countless
proposed games being lost for lack of sanctioning--sanctions that
were withheld long before anyone was talking about Carson.</TE>
<TE>   Jones says MLS teams are "powerless" to do anything about a match
deemed to be in conflict with their schedule. Why not just compete?
Or is that too old-fashioned an ideal for pro sports?</TE>
<TE>   The soccer mavens have a stranglehold on pro soccer in the United
States. They justify their authority on the "Amateur Sports Act."
They, like Jones, have turned logic on its head.</TE>

<LD>Strouds--A Business section brief March 5 about a judge's approval
of Strouds Inc.'s liquidation plan incorrectly reported that Strouds Inc.
was a seller of bed and bath linens. In fact, it is a former seller of
bed and bath linens. The Strouds stores, owned by a different company,
are unaffected. Strouds Inc., which was based in City of Industry, last
April completed its sale of its 50 stores, corporate headquarters and
other assets for $39.5 million to Strouds Acquisition Corp., a group made
up of some company executives and officials of investment firm Cruttenden
Partners.</LD>

<LD>Iditarod-An editorial Wednesday inadvertently put Anchorage even

Angeles-not Seattle, as was stated in the editorial-as Los Angeles is
from New York.</LD>

<LD>"I'm gonna walk before they make me run," Keith Richards once sang in
a Rolling Stones song. Now the Vanguard Theatre Ensemble knows what
he was talking about.</LD>
<LD>   After tonight's closing performance of Anton Chekhov's "The Three
Sisters," Orange County's longest-running storefront theater company
is going to walk away from its home in a Fullerton warehouse complex
before city officials make it run to the bank.</LD>
<LD>   It could cost $50,000 in production-related electrical repairs and
remodeling costs to bring the theater into line with fire and
building codes, said Wade Williamson, the Vanguard's artistic
director. Rather than pour that kind of money--which the company
doesn't have--into staying put, the ensemble and its board of
directors recently voted to shut down until they can find a new home.</LD>
<TE>   It makes more sense to spend a big sum refurbishing a
better-situated space, they decided, than to fix a 78-capacity room
whose drawbacks--especially its lack of visibility from the
street--had made moving a goal even before pressure came from city
inspectors. But the decision means Vanguard's 2002 season is on hold
until the company can find appropriate digs and raise the money to
outfit the place.</TE>
<TE>   Williamson said location scouting and a $50,000 fund-raising
campaign are underway; Vanguard has not set a timetable, but
Williamson said he hopes the theater can transplant itself within six
months. The plan is then to pick up where it left off, presenting the
five shows already announced for the rest of this year. The goal is
to find a new spot within a five-mile radius of the current theater,
Williamson said, so Vanguard can maintain its base in north Orange
County. Another requirement is proximity to restaurants--an amenity
lacking at the current site.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Page, president of Vanguard's board of directors, said the
company has already gotten one donor's promise of a matching grant of
$10,000. He said the shutdown has not jeopardized $20,000 already
committed this year by BMC Software, Vanguard's corporate sponsor.
The theater has also been promised 100 seats from the Shubert Theatre
in Los Angeles, which is due to be demolished in the fall for
redevelopment.</TE>
<TE>   The Vanguard ensemble formed in 1992 and has occupied its current
site almost from the beginning. The theater is tucked away in a
business park on State College Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   It can't be seen from the street, and there is no prominent,
well-lighted signage. Even those who have been to the theater
repeatedly may have to feel their way to find it, Williamson
acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   An extended hiatus is a drastic measure that poses obvious
problems. Regular patrons could get out of the Vanguard habit while
the theater hibernates. Williamson said the worst-case scenario would
be what befell the now-defunct Alternative Repertory Theater in Santa
Ana, which had 18 months of down-time in 1997-98 because of delays in
the remodeling of its new home, the downtown Grand Central Art
Center. The delay and the change of location contributed to lower
attendance and, ultimately, to ART's disbanding in 2000 after 13
years. Williamson pointed more hopefully to the example of Stages, a
storefront theater that successfully relocated in 1999 from Anaheim
to Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard's staple has been the intimate staging of classics by
writers such as Shaw, Chekhov and Arthur Miller as well as and works
by established contemporary playwrights. This season began with Sam
Shepard's "Fool For Love" and "The Three Sisters." The decision to
move puts a hold on upcoming works by James Elward, Edward Albee,
Nicky Silver and Romulus Linney--as well as Vanguard's first premiere
of a new play, "In the Absence of Angels," by Orange County writer
Johnna Adams.</TE>
<TE>   Williamson promises they all will be done once a new home is
found. The move may be disruptive, he said, but "it's what's needed
to help this company be bigger and better and stronger than it is."</TE>
<TE>   Groves Seem to Be Sprouting All Over</TE>
<TE>   The Grove of Anaheim, by any other name, would smell a lot sweeter
to the management of the Grove Theater Center in Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   The erstwhile Sun Theater, a 1,200-seat venue for rock concerts,
changed its name last December to the Grove of Anaheim after a change
of ownership. Now the Garden Grove Grove, which puts on plays in a
172-seat indoor theater and an adjoining 350-capacity outdoor
amphitheater, is crying foul.</TE>
<TE>   Phones at the Grove Theater Center are being tied up by callers
who want to reach the rock venue, said Charles L. Johanson, the
theater's executive director. What's more, Johanson fears that, now
that tickets for GTC's spring and summer season are on sale, folks
who call 411 for the number will be sent on a wild goose chase to the
rock venue's box office, possibly costing the Grove Theater Center
some sales.</TE>
<TE>   The Grove Theater Center has been around since 1994 under Johanson
and artistic director Kevin Cochran; a precursor company, Grove
Shakespeare, operated the theater before that. When it comes to
entertainment venues in Orange County, Johanson says, seniority gives
the Garden Grove Grove dibs on "Grove" and the Grove of Anaheim needs
a new moniker to remove confusion.</TE>
<TE>   Johanson recently sent a letter to that effect to Stephen Lazar,
general manager of the Grove of Anaheim, and to Lazar's corporate
bosses at SMG in Philadelphia. Lazar did not return calls seeking
comment.</TE>
<TE>   "We put a lot of time and energy into the name selection,"
Johanson said. "We took Grove Theater Center because of Garden Grove
and the connotation of a grove as a nice place. There are trees here,
and we're on a nice little Main Street. There's certainly nothing
grove-ish about being across the street from Disneyland."</TE>
<TE>   Johanson said he found out about the name conflict in January when
friends in New York City sent him congratulatory e-mails on having
booked comedian Paula Poundstone. Oops, wrong Grove.</TE>
<TE>   He knows the folksy, decidedly non-corporate Garden Grove Grove
will be the underdog if this turns into a legal fight. Johanson said
his theaters drew no more than 4,000 playgoers last year in Garden
Grove and in Fullerton, where the Grove Theater Center operates an
outdoor summer series. The Grove of Anaheim can surpass that in a
good week.</TE>
<TE>   Its parent corporation, SMG, manages a national network of sports
and entertainment facilities, and according to SMG's Web site,
attendance topped 25 million at its venues in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Grove Theater Center is appealing to SMG's sense of fairness,
Johanson said. "They're a huge company. If they decided to lawyer us
to death, we don't have the money [to prevail]."</TE>
