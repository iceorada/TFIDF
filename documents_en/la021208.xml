<LD>Angelo</LD>
<LD>   David Macaulay</LD>
<LD>   Houghton/Lorraine: 48 pp., $16</LD>
<TE>   Despite his "professional dislike" for birds, an elderly plasterer
named Angelo carries home an injured pigeon he comes across while
restoring the exterior of a church. An unlikely friendship springs up
as he nurses Sylvia back to health. Later, she returns the favor:
When he moves a bit more slowly, she sticks around to "coo
encouragement," fanning him with her wings and entertaining him at
lunchtime. David Macaulay knows how to get the most humor out of his
illustrations, both in the finer details and the broader strokes.

<TE>   Eloise Takes a Bawth</TE>
<TE>   Kay Thompson, illustrated by Hilary Knight with</TE>
<TE>   "additional plumbing" by Mart Crowley</TE>
<TE>   Simon &amp; Schuster: 80 pp., $17.95</TE>
<TE>   Ever-irrepressible Eloise absolutely loves taking a bawth, and her
devotees will absolutely love seeing her "splawsh, splawsh, splawsh"
her way through a delightfully disastrous -- yet ultimately
propitious -- time in the tub. "You have to be absolutely careful
when you take a bawth in a hotel," announces the famous
Plaza-dweller, who ignores her own advice and turns on all the
faucets. A postscript explains that Kay Thompson and Hilary Knight
collaborated on this book 40 years ago, and it has been brought to
light with the help of playwright Mart Crowley. Since the buoyant art
and humorously bubbly text surely rise to the level of its
precursors, it's high time this book appeared, "for Lord's sake," as
Eloise herself might say. (Ages 5 and older)</TE>

<TE>   I Love Saturdays Y Domingos</TE>
<TE>   Alma Flor Ada, illustrated by Elivia Savadier</TE>
<TE>   Simon &amp; Schuster/Atheneum:</TE>
<TE>   32 pp., $16.95</TE>
<TE>   Through this affectionate and revealing portrait of a bilingual
girl's weekend visits to her two sets of grandparents, Alma Flor Ada
("Where the Flame Trees Bloom") and Elivia Savadier ("A Bedtime
Story") prove that straddling two worlds can be a blessing rather
than a hardship. The left of each spread depicts the narrator
spending Saturdays with her paternal grandparents, with whom she
speaks English; on the right, she passes los domingos (Sundays) with
her Mexican American abuelito and abuelita and converses in Spanish.
Each pairing makes for a loving comparison and contrast, enlivened by
Savadier's graceful, warm-toned watercolor spot illustrations. (Ages
4-8)</TE>

<TE>   The Great Pancake Escape</TE>
<TE>   Paul Many, illustrated by Scott Goto</TE>
<TE>   Walker &amp; Co.: 32 pp., $16.95</TE>
<TE>   After a magician father bungles breakfast, magical hotcakes lead
three hungry children on a wild chase in this rhyming tale: "We had
no chance to stop them / as they leaped up on their edges, /
skittered quickly out the door, / and rolled right past the hedges."
The children spot the flapjacks posing as manhole covers, dog toys
and wheels on skates, and, in an apparent nod to Magritte, serving as
umbrellas for bowler-hatted citizens. A backward spell summons the
pancakes home. (Ages 5-8)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Counting Stars</TE>
<TE>   David Almond</TE>
<TE>   Delacorte: 206 pp., $16.95</TE>
<TE>   In this evocative collection of autobiographical vignettes, David
Almond's writing exudes the same haunting mood that characterizes his
novels ("Skellig," "Heaven Eyes"). Here, readers can trace connecting
threads between his works and childhood experiences as a sensitive,
pensive child preoccupied by the mysteries of religion, death and
immortality. (Ages 10 and older)</TE>

<TE>   John Coltrane's Giant Steps</TE>
<TE>   Chris Raschka</TE>
<TE>   Atheneum/Jackson: 32 pp., $17</TE>
<TE>   This innovative visual deconstruction of one of jazz saxophonist
John Coltrane's most beloved compositions may be Chris Raschka's
("Mysterious Thelonious") most ambitious picture book yet. The book
does not require previous awareness of the jazz great's work,
however. Raschka's transparent watercolors layer colors and shapes
the way a musician would notes and harmonies. Stunningly simple, the
concept provides a compelling introduction to Coltrane's musical
genius. A must for jazz enthusiasts and, for first-timers, a clever
introduction to this wildly creative musical genre. (Ages 4-7)</TE>

<TE>   Once Upon a Farm</TE>
<TE>   Marie Bradby, illustrated by Ted Rand</TE>
<TE>   Scholastic/Orchard: 32 pp., $16.95</TE>
<TE>   With the gentle cadence befitting a simpler time, Marie Bradby
harvests a bounty of bucolic imagery for this poetic look at a family
farm. A boy relates the challenges and sweet rewards that come with
working the land. By book's end, he sadly shares the information that
suburban sprawl means the end of his farm home and way of life. Ted
Rand's ("Sailing Home") parting illustration of a bulldozer razing
tall trees brings home Bradby's message in a quietly dramatic style.
(Ages 4-7)</TE>

<TE>   Snow Day</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Plourde, illustrated by Hideko Takahashi</TE>
<TE>   Simon &amp; Schuster: 32 pp., $16</TE>
<TE>   "Yawn. / Hug the pillow. / A cozy, curled lump in the quilt. /
Mama whispers, 'Snow day, child.' / The quilt bursts open. / Is it
... / Could it ... / Would it be?" To a child, perhaps no two words
inspire greater joy than Lynn Plourde's ("Pigs in the Mud in the
Middle of the Rud") titular phrase. For the family -- freed from
school, released from work and not tethered to the television set --
the day is defined by its events. Plourde's snappy verse, with its
brief phrases and effective use of onomatopoeia, conveys the active
pace from wake-up to wind-down. Hideko Takahashi's ("Beach Play")
bold acrylics feature the wide-eyed, exuberant brother and sister in
crisp winter landscapes and cozy scenes by the hearth. (Ages 3-6)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stand Tall</TE>
<TE>   Joan Bauer</TE>
<TE>   Putnam: 192 pp., $16.99</TE>
<TE>   In her heartfelt and humorous novel "Stand Tall," Joan Bauer
leaves teenage girl protagonists in favor of a middle-grade boy -- as
she did also in "Sticks" (1996). But her fans won't be disappointed.
At first, 12-year-old Tree, "six feet, three and a half inches and
growing," only literally "stands tall." Bolstered by his budding
friendship with the outspoken new girl at school, Sophie, and by
Grandpa, Tree finds an inner strength that helps him deal with just
about anything, including a natural disaster. Bauer's ("Hope Was
Here") swiftly paced story is a triumphant tale that will resonate
with many young readers. (Ages 10 and older)</TE>

<LD>All Is Vanity, Christina Schwarz, Doubleday: 368 pp., $24.95</LD>
<LD>   Margaret and Letty, educated, resourceful urban women in their
mid-30s -- best friends since childhood -- feel the weight of the
years passing, with only meager accomplishments to show. Time, they
believe, is running out in "All Is Vanity," an enthralling, satirical
novel by Christina Schwarz ("Drowning Ruth"). Both women know
instinctively they're not mediocre people awash in a sea of humanity:
They're special. Cloaked in incisive wit, the novel is a tragedy in
the classic sense.</LD>
<LD>   Margaret, living in New York, quits her job teaching English to
write the great American novel, certain that a year off work will
transform her into a literary success. Letty, a West Los Angeles
mother of four small children, thinks that if she can keep pace with
the upper-middle-class families of her social circuit -- the right
haircuts for the kids, the right house -- she'll be the stunning wife
and mother she was meant to be. In this funny yet touching tale,
Schwarz deftly delineates the tragedy of the human condition. When it
comes to overthrowing egotism and the green-eyed monster of envy,
there's a bit of Letty's covetousness and Margaret's rash ambition in
us all. Self-knowledge, in the long run, avails us nothing.</LD>

<TE>   Ambassador of the Dead, Askold Melnyczuk, Counterpoint: 266 pp.,
$25</TE>
<TE>   Askold Melnyczuk's "Ambassador of the Dead" brings the dark,
fabled world of Ukraine, with its brooding passions, to the shiny,
optimistic streets of America in a triumph of style and storytelling.
His masterful book begins ominously: The narrator, Nick Blud, a
Boston physician, receives a phone call from Adriana Kruk, the
beautiful mother of his childhood friend Alex, whom he hasn't seen in
years. Adriana summons Nick back to his New Jersey hometown, telling
him she has something urgent to relate. As he sits in her living room
awaiting her revelation, he begins to meditate on his past: "In
different ways I had loved all the Kruks -- they were my little
Russian novel, so impulsive and uncontainable, you never knew if they
were going to kiss you or bite you ...." The same could be said of
Melnyczuk's writing. He skillfully re-creates the post-World War II
immigrant neighborhood of Nick's youth, where Ukrainian families
alternately struggle to assimilate and be true to their heritage.
Nick's family is all for the New World, but the Kruks, led by the
mysterious and powerful Adriana, cling to their past. Though Nick and
Alex attempt to blend in with the American landscape, neither can
escape the otherworldliness of Adriana. She is a country all to
herself, the compelling heart of the story. Melnyczuk's "Ambassador
of the Dead" is an eloquent meditation on the human need for a rooted
historical perspective. His ambassador, Adriana, invites comparison
to one of the tempestuous Karamazovs. With her, he has brought the
great tradition of Russian literature to American soil.</TE>

<TE>   Anna in the Afterlife, Merrill Joan Gerber, Syracuse University
Press / Library of Modern Jewish Literature: 124 pp., $22.95 paper</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Joan Gerber is not only one of our most underrated
contemporary writers, she also may well be our least pretentious. Her
utter lack of pretense is a major source of her raw power as a
writer. In her latest novel, a tough little gem called "Anna in the
Afterlife," Gerber returns to one of her most memorable characters,
Anna Goldman, the forceful, discontented mother of the young heroine
in "An Antique Man," more recently glimpsed in her 80s lying
immobile, resentful and furious in a nursing home in the story
collection "Anna in Chains." Now, after seven years in the chains of
her illness, Anna finally dies. The opening whisks us into the
world-weary mind-set of its heroine: "Once her dying got underway,
Anna could not really complain about how the process moved along."
Like Saul Bellow, Gerber has a genius for the irritable, the acrid
and the embittered: The visitor from another planet who doesn't know
what it means to kvetch would need to look no further than Gerber's
fiction for superb illustrations of the phenomenon. Unlike Bellow,
she does not venture far beyond the personal. Her eyes are trained on
the quotidian, but the acuity and intensity of her vision are no less
extraordinary.</TE>

<TE>   At the Jim Bridger: Stories, Ron Carlson, Picador USA: 194 pp.,
$23</TE>
<TE>   Contemporary stories and novels about the American West have
developed certain conventions. There is a down-at-the-heels motel on
a poor road at the edge of a wind-worn town. Its manager, an aging
man with a dubious past, sits on a folding chair watching the flicker
of the TV. Outside, a car pulls up on the gravel. A couple comes in
and rents a room. A plot ensues. It unfolds and, in the end, flings
the characters back into the rootless past from which they blew in.
Ron Carlson's nine stories and two stream-of-consciousness bits in
"At the Jim Bridger" contain some of the conventions. There is a
joint called the Blue Bird. There is a motel in Arizona called the El
Sol. There are characters whose pasts are indistinct. But Carlson
goes beyond the conventions to create characters who in their
strangeness become suddenly rich with life, their situations lying
just beyond the edges of commonplace existence. Carlson's most
ambitious story is the title piece. In its complexity, it is really a
novella. In the mountains at the Jim Bridger Lodge, named for the
mountain man and scout, a man who is with a woman, not his wife, has
told her of getting caught in a blizzard on an earlier mountain trip,
and how he and another man, saving themselves in the storm,
experienced an almost involuntary but powerful erotic encounter with
one another. Carlson tells that story with both delicacy and force.
This collection of stories about people in the uncertain moral
terrain of the American West consistently surprises and delights.</TE>

<TE>   Atonement, Ian McEwan, Nan A. Talese / Doubleday: 358 pp., $26</TE>
<TE>   For decades now, Americans have been on the lookout for the Great
American Novel, a work of fiction that captures the essential truths
about the way we live now. We elevate one writer after another --
first Don DeLillo, then Jonathan Franzen -- in the belief that the
American sensibility is the best lens for viewing the human condition
in the 20th century, or the 21st century, for that matter. Yet such a
thought only reveals the brazen Yankee conviction that we are the
center of the world. Ian McEwan makes quite clear just how foolish
this assumption is, having written in "Atonement" what might be
called the Great British Novel, a book that invites us to look at the
particulars of modern English history and the cataclysmic changes
that have, willy-nilly, shaken up our Western notion about the
inviolable nature of cultural norms. What he has to say about social
bonds, familial allegiance, uncensored libido and base aggression
leads the reader to an empathic perspective that extends well beyond
his immediate shores. "Atonement" is a work of vaulting ambition that
just also happens to be a page-turner. The novel teems with musings
on the unforeseen quirks of causality, the multiplicity of selves
that reside within a single character and the writerly desire to
wring a coherent fiction out of the chaos of reality. It also, not
insignificantly, contains one of the more erotically charged scenes
I've read. In the seriousness of its intentions and the dazzle of its
language, it made me starry-eyed all over again on behalf of
literature's humanizing possibilities.</TE>

<TE>   The Autograph Man, Zadie Smith, Random House: 352 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Zadie Smith stormed onto the publishing scene in 2000 with "White
Teeth," a burly first novel that embraced the 21st century with its
zesty portrait of ethnic, class and sexual conflicts in multicultural
London, taking side trips as far afield as Jamaica and Bangladesh.
It's a pleasure to report that her latest book is just as
stimulating. "The Autograph Man" mingles such quintessentially
contemporary themes as our obsession with fame and the substitution
of entertainment for experience with time-honored subjects like the
tangled bonds between fathers and sons and the inevitability of
death. All are considered with the same bracing intelligence and
salty humor that distinguished her debut. Tracing her hero's odyssey,
Smith scatters marvelous sentences and sharp insights on nearly every
page, astutely placing many of them in the mouths of her characters.
The fact that Smith's reach sometimes exceeds her grasp indicates how
bold that reach is. She tackles big subjects, and her talent is very
nearly equal to her ambitions.</TE>

<TE>   Bad Boy Brawly Brown, Walter Mosley, Little, Brown: 312 pp.,
$24.95</TE>
<TE>   Few sequences in modern crime fiction are as breathtaking and
poignant as the final moments of Walter Mosley's 1996 novel, "A
Little Yellow Dog," when Mosley's hero, Easy Rawlins, and Raymond
"Mouse" Alexander, his partner of some 20 years, are ambushed in a
blind alley in South-Central Los Angeles. With a few deft strokes,
Mosley brings the world to its knees. It's 1963. JFK's just been
assassinated, Los Angeles has come of age and, in a hail of gunfire,
Easy and Mouse find themselves fighting for their lives. It's a
familiar moment, only this time everything goes wrong. Mouse gets
hit, and in their escape, Easy watches his best friend slip away. Is
it any wonder Mosley took six years -- and six other novels -- before
telling us what happens next? Some things you just don't walk away
from.</TE>
<TE>   With "Big Bad Brawly Brown," a story with the same imaginative
vigor and the same unflinching honesty as its predecessors, Mosley
continues to put a strong claim on urban crime fiction, a claim that
says as much about the city of Los Angeles as it does about America
at large. In his success, he once again leaves us eager for more.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baudolino, Umberto Eco , Translated from the Italian by William
Weaver, Harcourt: 522 pp., $27</TE>
<TE>   Umberto Eco's "Baudolino" manifests many of the exuberant
extravagances that made "The Name of the Rose" so hugely enjoyable.
The novel is the story of Baudolino, an Italian of poor origin who is
adopted by Frederick Barbarossa, the 12th century Holy Roman emperor.
The tale is his life story as told to Niketas, a Byzantine nobleman
whom Baudolino saves during the sack of Constantinople by forces from
the West in 1204. He tells of wonderful things, in particular how he
became a liar and discovered that the lies he told became true or
better than true. Eco twists the braggart's narrative because not
only is Baudolino a liar, he also knows he is a liar. It consequently
becomes a very Eco-ish game in that we are reading a fiction about a
fiction that often contains yet more levels of fiction. The author is
engaged in a continuous subversion not only of the forms of the
historical novel -- which depends on a sort of contract between
author and reader that disbelief will be suspended for the duration
even when the period being described is well-known -- but also of our
engagement with any sort of narrative at all. In so doing, of course,
Eco is making a point about the nature of belief itself and giving an
insight into the medieval mind, which had no effective theoretical or
practical means of checking information to see whether it should be
credited or not. It is quite a disorienting experience and very
effectively done. There is a vast amount of information and
entertainment here and, in the end, the reader capitulates to Eco's
demands and wallows in it as someone in the Middle Ages would have
done: with all the critical faculties shut down, simply relishing a
good yarn.</TE>

<TE>   The Book of Illusions, Paul Auster, Henry Holt: 336 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone thought he was dead." With seeming transparency, Paul
Auster opens "The Book of Illusions," his 10th and most affecting and
virtuosic novel. Auster has always packed a library of imagination
into his novels, and illusion has always projected its tantalizing
images on the cave walls of his writing. His Cartesian musings on
life, death and the many illusions the living must fabricate to keep
the sputtering reels of their lives turning have been integral parts
of his voice throughout his many novels, from the collegiate
fantasies of "Moon Palace" to "Timbuktu," whose hero is the canine
companion of a schizophrenic. But in "The Book of Illusions," an
older and wiser Auster has added a new ingredient to the metaphysical
play and deft storytelling, a sadness that colors all illusion, that
creates a stunningly moving and very real portrait of a man
over-marked by death. The marvel of "The Book of Illusions" is that
it is no mere metaphysical exercise. The novel packs the weight of a
human heart between its dramatic covers. It is the memoir of a man
who died, a man who disappeared when his wife and his sons fell out
of the sky and lost the right to touch his loved ones. It is a story
of unspeakable grief told with virtuosic brilliance, which Auster
finally brings safely to Earth with a very human simplicity.</TE>

<TE>   Caramelo, Sandra Cisneros, Alfred A. Knopf: 448 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   It has been nearly 20 years since Sandra Cisneros' acclaimed first
novel, "The House on Mango Street," a coming-of-age story told in
poetic vignettes, brought her unique voice and the Chicana experience
to millions of American readers. High school and college students in
particular found her first novel authentic and simpatico. Her 1991
short story collection, "Woman Hollering Creek," offered a wider
range of voices, a broader scope. With "Caramelo," her exuberant,
overstuffed new novel, she undertakes storytelling on a grand scale,
detailing the struggles and joys of three generations of a family
that bridges the Mexican, Mexican American and American experiences
during the momentous migrations of the last century, evoking a subtle
panorama of cultural shifts. Its characters leap from the page in all
their flawed humanity, falling in and out of love, squabbling and
making up, working hard and making do. Like Eduardo Galeano, John Dos
Passos and John Steinbeck, Cisneros writes along the borders where
the novel and social history intersect. She is particularly gifted at
showing how the ebb and flow of history affect those previously
marginalized: the poor, the immigrants, the women who have been
traditionally without a voice in literature. In this lovingly told
and poetic novel, she uses the storytelling art to give these
voiceless ones a voice, and to find the border to the past, imbuing
the struggles of her family and her countries with the richness of
myth.</TE>

<TE>   The Cave, Jose Saramago , Translated from the Portuguese by
Margaret Jull Costa, Harcourt: 308 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   "The Cave" is an allegorical novel alive through its details --
its mulberry tree and dog, its van and potter's kiln -- but
judiciously unspecific as to physiognomy and place, so that the
characters' faces and their city may be filled in with the thought of
our own. Jose Saramago's long fluid sentences, richly stocked with
folk wisdom, swerve through psychology and the physical world with
equal assurance and lend his novels a rare quality of permanence;
it's as if only a story confirmed in its shape many times before
could be so confidently told.</TE>

<TE>   Child of My Heart, Alice McDermott, Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux: 242
pp., $23</TE>
<TE>   One winter afternoon in Queens, circa 1960, Theresa, the
15-year-old narrator of Alice McDermott's wondrous new novel, takes
her little cousin Daisy to a candy store. They buy 100 lollipops and
bring them home to Daisy's siblings -- six brothers and a skeptical
sister, who asks, as any child would, "Where'd you get these?" Before
Daisy can answer, Theresa is inventing a sugary but morbid fantasy
about an old couple whose only child, 50 years ago to the day,
dreamed of a lollipop tree in his frontyard at dusk and then suddenly
died. Each year on the anniversary of his death, in the brief
February hour between daylight and dark, the couple hang lollipops on
their front willow for the neighborhood children.</TE>
<TE>   Like William Trevor, McDermott is a genius of quiet observation.
Her antenna is perpetually raised and turning, humming and warm with
reception. Her novels possess a satisfying sameness, in the same way
that Jane Austen's novels share certain similarities in content and
tone but are uniquely enchanting.</TE>
<TE>   And as with Austen, McDermott, one of our finest novelists at work
today, is the master of a domain that in the hands of most writers
would be limiting. In "Child of My Heart," she has transformed her
trademark material of Irish American life into a poignant and
rewarding fictional world. "Child of My Heart" extends her artistic
triumphs, and we should rejoice.</TE>

<TE>   The Collected Stories of Joseph Roth, Joseph Roth , Translated
from the German by Michael Hofmann, W.W. Norton: 282 pp., $27.95</TE>
<TE>   The mark of a Joseph Roth short story is the leap into a kind of
magical elegy. The pain of loss is everywhere in his work, especially
in the stories collected here by Michael Hofmann, his adept
translator. Roth the writer emerged from the rubble of a lost world,
the world of Europe before World War I, where everything was known or
knowable and nothing would ever change -- or if it did, never for the
worse. And then, in the blink of an eye, an archduke was assassinated
and the whole elaborate artifice fell apart. Roth has made that
historic moment into a psychological moment too, for his characters:
Loss of innocence goes along with loss of home, or of homeland. His
fictional terrain is a land of specific places -- the bad corners of
certain cities, squalid little villages near bigger villages, train
stations along the way, town squares, parks and cemeteries -- in a
world where all the reasonable maps have been lost or, worse, burned.
To read this seductive collection is to be invited into a writer's
notebook -- a very great writer's notebook. The book has some of the
odd pleasures one might have gotten looking into Proust's trash can.
It bobsleds down from the pristine summits of perfect, resonant
storytelling to the very depths of artistic raveling and
exasperation.</TE>

<TE>   Sara Rosario Gonzalez is a 32-year-old restorer of rare books at
the Getty Museum in Los Angeles who unexpectedly finds herself on the
verge of a heartbreak, but as Yxta Maya Murray shows in "The
Conquest," the human yearning to overcome loss can sometimes be the
inspiration that leads to great art. When Sara's high school
sweetheart, Marine Capt. Karl Sullivan, announces his engagement to
another woman and wants Sara to let go of him, she lures him back
into her bed by doing what she does best: Like Scheherazade, she
reveals to him piecemeal the content of a manuscript she's working
on: the saga of a female Aztec juggler abducted to Europe in 1528 by
Hernan Cortes after he overthrew the Aztec empire and won Mexico for
the Spanish crown. The untitled folio, which Sara calls "The
Conquest," is more than a gambit for Karl's affection. It becomes
Sara's attempt to give a voice to her ancestors and to all brown
women; in the process, she will rediscover her own mestiza identity
and confront the transgressions of the Old World upon the New. But
first, there is something of a mystery to be worked out concerning
the authorship of the manuscript.</TE>
<TE>   From her first novel, "Locas," to "What It Takes to Get to Vegas,"
Murray has taken a major step as a writer in "The Conquest," creating
a hybrid garden of literary intricacies that might have amused even
Jorge Luis Borges. "The Conquest" tackles the excruciating question
of how to redress loss, whether it be in the form of a 500-year-old
conquest that has deprived the indigenous people of the universe as
they knew it, the loss of a lover or the gradual erosion of one's
cultural identity in the modern world.</TE>

<TE>   The Crazed, Ha Jin, Pantheon: 330 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   Ha Jin, author of the 1999 National Book Award-winning novel,
"Waiting," a quiet love story dancing between human and political
tensions as set against the backdrop of the Chinese Cultural
Revolution, continues to mine this rich and historically relevant
territory in his newest work, "The Crazed." In spare yet radiant
prose, Jin depicts the daily existence of Jian Wan, a young man whose
life is neatly ordered.</TE>
<TE>   A graduate student in literature at remote Shanning University,
Jian has been studying diligently under his beloved mentor, Professor
Yang, in preparation for the entrance exams for the doctoral program
at Beijing University. Once he passes the exam, he'll be reunited in
the capital with his fiancee, Meimei (Professor Yang's daughter),
who's in Beijing preparing for medical school. Their lives will then
unfold as predictably and comfortably as can be expected: he as an
intellectual, balancing the exigencies of art with the circumspection
required under the Communist regime, she as an ambitious physician.
At least that was the plan before Professor Yang suffers a stroke
just weeks before the exam and Jian is expected, as "the only family
Professor Yang has here," to care for him every afternoon. Initially,
the only thing disrupted by the professor's illness is Jian's study
plans. It's difficult to get much intellectual work done while
sitting in a mangy hospital room, listening to the rantings and
hallucinations of one's professor. The more Professor Yang indulges
his outbursts of singing, poetry reciting, raving against communism
and speaking to people not there, the more Jian is pulled into the
mysteries of his professor's life.</TE>
<TE>   Left deliciously ambiguous by the author are important questions:
Are Yang's railings only figments of a damaged mind, delusions not to
be trusted, or is Yang finally speaking the truth in a country where
honesty and defiance are harshly punished? Is Yang the "crazed" of
the book's title, or is it the society in which he lives? In this
slow-moving but beautifully layered tale, Jian must decide the nature
of truth for himself. Repressive politics, treachery and hunger for
power, viciousness and desperation are at the heart of this tale,
which Jin balances tenuously against the redemption of love, the
importance of art and the vital need for narrative to make sense of
our lives and our suffering.</TE>

<TE>   The Emperor of Ocean Park, Stephen L. Carter, Alfred A. Knopf: 672
pp., $26.95</TE>
<TE>   Stephen L. Carter's "The Emperor of Ocean Park" is a remarkable
novel. A member of the Yale Law School faculty for more than 20
years, Carter has written a number of scholarly works, none of which
hinted at his gift for fiction. "The Emperor" is so rich in detail
about a particular segment of American society that it could have
been written only by someone with unusual access to the subject and
by someone with extraordinary powers of observation and expression.
Carter has both.</TE>
<TE>   As with all serious literature, "The Emperor of Ocean Park"
grounds its most important relationship in truths that transcend
matters of race. Like John Cheever and Philip Roth, Carter confirms
that above a certain tax bracket, race or religion does not make
Americans crazy. Money, advancement, prestige and power do -- and the
need to own and possess in a society where nothing is free, not even
ambition, not even a father's love. Carter is wise enough to define
his book on these terms, above all others.</TE>

<TE>   Everything Is Illuminated, Jonathan Safran Foer, Houghton Mifflin:
276 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Safran Foer, the 25-year-old author of this remarkable
first novel, was the editor of an anthology of writings devoted to
American artist Joseph Cornell. The temptation to compare the
brimming, tidbit-strewn and delightful "Everything Is Illuminated"
with one of Cornell's curio-filled boxes is impossible to resist:
They both demand and deserve to be considered repeatedly and from
varying angles; they provoke laughter as easily as they elicit
curiosity. Yet "Everything Is Illuminated" is more than an oddball
object. It's probably the first convincing report from Generation Y
(for lack of a better label) on the legacy of the Holocaust. It's a
powerful document, telling the story of Jonathan Safran Foer (the
protagonist's name is the same as the author's) and his idealistic
search, during the summer before senior year in college, for
Trachimbrod, the vanished Ukrainian shtetl where his grandfather
somehow escaped the Nazis. Entwined with this search, in alternating
chapters, is Jonathan's work-in-progress, a precociously surreal
novel about Trachimbrod from 1791 to the day the bombs came down in
1941. With its multiple narrators, spiraling layers of jokes and
breakneck shifts between hilarity and horror, with its Nabokovian
aura of mischief-making, with its sidelong glances at post-Iron
Curtain capitalism and contemporary anti-Semitism and, with its
daringness to show that irony, in the right hands, still has the
power to enlighten, "Everything Is Illuminated" is a veritable box of
treasures.</TE>

<TE>   Family Matters, Rohinton Mistry, Alfred A. Knopf: 440 pp., $26</TE>
<TE>   Rohinton Mistry's title is nicely ambiguous. Is "Family Matters"
noun-verb or adjective-noun? In Bombay's Parsee society, family
clearly matters a great deal. But coping with the actual matters --
emotional, financial, medical, psychological, physical -- that family
relations impose, too often, as Mistry shows in devastating detail,
wears away the love, replacing it with sour distaste, unacknowledged
fear, simmering resentment and sheer desperation. Hopeless dreams
breed bizarre and fantastic solutions. Remembered wrongs poison the
mind. Kinship becomes a burden, the ties of blood an arbitrary
imposition. Poverty exacerbates every problem and hones the fine edge
of hysteria. The tentacles of family relationships, like
mother-in-law jokes and quarrels over wills, are universal, and, as
the collected fiction of Ivy Compton-Burnett amply testifies, having
a reasonable amount of money doesn't always let you off the hook,
either. Those characters in "Family Matters" who, near the end, are
rescued by a Dickensian-type windfall soon start working up a new set
of irritations. What enriches "Family Matters" are the minor
characters and lovingly described scenes of daily life: Here Mistry
frequently put me in mind of Vikram Seth's vast Indian panorama, "A
Suitable Boy." He includes fascinating descriptions of Zarathustrian
temple ritual (and of the complex socio-religious taboos that
impinge, sometimes devastatingly, on these characters' lives). The
scene in which Daisy, the downstairs tenant and first violin in the
Bombay Symphony Orchestra, keeps her promise to play for Mistry's
central and largely passive character, Nariman Vakeel, on his
deathbed is, against all odds, genuinely moving.</TE>

<TE>   Fox Girl, Nora Okja Keller, Viking: 290 pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Disturbing, riveting and necessary is Nora Okja Keller's "Fox
Girl," the tale of throwaway children and prostitutes stranded in the
aftermath of the Korean War. Following up on her first novel,
"Comfort Woman," in which Keller mined the same difficult terrain of
war, sex and power, "Fox Girl" tells the distressing first-person
account of Hyun Jin, a young Korean girl on the cusp of maturity
whose face is inscribed with a large birthmark and whose mother shows
her nothing but contempt.</TE>
<TE>   A brutal coming-of-age tale, "Fox Girl" is devastating. Through
Keller's use of crisp writing, razor-sharp metaphors and utter
narrative command, we witness the destruction of Hyun Jin's innocence
by greed, bad luck and forces beyond her control, as she, like
innumerable others, becomes yet another unacknowledged victim of war.
Still, her spirit continues to demand a better life. Told in stark,
painful, sexually graphic and heart-rending images, "Fox Girl" is a
story that haunts, with scenes that replay long after the book is
closed. Steel yourself before opening the pages, but, surely, open
them. This is a vital, urgent work, reminding us not only of the
horrors of war but also how "only Americans believe in happy
endings."</TE>

<TE>   James Sallis has a knack for pairing the laconic with the
metaphysical, the cozily quotidian with the surreal. His eighth tale,
"Ghost of a Flea," draws the reader into a strange and richly
populated universe. In twists and turns of bizarre incident and
poignant human encounters, the story traverses the alleys and
gator-tail joints, bars and hospital wards of one man's New Orleans
-- a city ragged with the violence that proceeds from poverty and
entrenched inequality, populated by homeless loners who fight back
with whimsy, madness and wit. It bears the marks of a fierce and
original writer working at full power. The penultimate chapter
explodes on the page, extending strands of light that tie together
previously unconnected elements with stunning clarity. And still it's
not over, for there is one more short chapter to go, only the length
of an afterthought, and yet, with the power to rotate this whole
fictional universe, leave it suspended upside-down long enough for
the reader to race back to the beginning of the story and ride it

<TE>   Pramoedya Ananta Toer</TE>
<TE>   Translated from the Indonesian by Willem Samuels</TE>
<TE>   Hyperion East: 282 pp., $22.95</TE>
<TE>   A survivor of the Japanese occupation during World War II, a
soldier in the Indonesian Revolution, a political prisoner of the
Suharto regime for 14 years, Pramoedya Ananta Toer is one of the 20th
century's great voices of conscience. This new translation of "The
Girl From the Coast," a novel written and first published (in serial
form in a newspaper) in 1965, is a major contribution to the growing
body of Pramoedya's works in English. It was written while Pramoedya
was at the height of his creative powers, a commanding intellectual
figure in the twilight years of the regime of Sukarno, Indonesia's
founding ruler.</TE>
<TE>   Set on the north coast of Java at the end of the 19th century, the
novel is a sort of pre-autobiography, telling the story of
Pramoedya's grandmother. A nameless 14-year-old girl is forced by her
parents into an arranged marriage with a rich aristocrat, known as
the Bendoro. A simple fisherman's daughter, she overnight becomes the
lady of her husband's household. After she adjusts to her new life,
she becomes pregnant, only to discover that she is a "practice wife"
who will not only be discarded by the Bendoro but also will be
separated from the child she is carrying. It is a classic tragedy,
enacted with tremendous, restrained gravity, in Willem Samuels'
polished, lucid translation. Pramoedya achieves his most devastating
effects by discreet, elliptical indirection, a defining Javanese
trait.</TE>

<TE>   Nega Mezlekia left his native Ethiopia in 1983 and chronicled his

"Notes From the Hyena's Belly." In his first novel, Mezlekia returns
to his homeland but goes back even further, to the 18th century, when
Ethiopia was still Abyssinia. This is an Africa rarely glimpsed: not
quite colonial and not yet modern. Mezlekia's Abyssinia is both
feudal and ancient, pagan and biblical, and it often bears
uncomfortable parallels to our own time. His story is about a
clandestine affair between a young court entertainer named Gudu, born
of slaves and with a precocious flair for language, and Aster, the
only daughter of the imperious Count Ashenafi. "The God Who Begat a
Jackal" is a tall tale imbued with documentary detail and the weight
of history, and its story lines are as ancient as they are timeless.</TE>

<TE>   Surely one of the most eccentric novels to appear in recent years,
"Gould's Book of Fish: A Novel in 12 Fish" by Tasmanian writer

our time. From David Foster Wallace's "Infinite Jest" to Thomas

slip free of sturdy old realism by summoning the odd alternate
universe, always running the risk that readers will be distracted by
the little man behind the curtain, frantically working the machinery
that supplies the magic. "Gould's Book of Fish" is such an
experiment: by turns enchanting, bemusing and irritating. What's
memorable -- even extraordinary -- about this book are Flanagan's
aphoristic talent, his imagination and his uncanny ability to channel
the Rabelaisian voices of the great picaresque writers -- Fielding,

<TE>   Frederic Tuten</TE>
<TE>   W.W. Norton: 256 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   The title of Frederic Tuten's fifth work of fiction identifies
that wonder working interval when Parisians resort to cafes to seek a
heightened or at least an altered state of being wrought by the
verdant transformations of "Lethe's livid absinthe." Thus the reader
is alerted to the probable nature of the present elegant fable, its
desperate readiness to discard the conventions of realism, although
this author's previous books, in their different ways, had served
similar notice from the start, which was "The Adventures of Mao on
the Long March" 20 years back. Then came "Tallien: A Brief Romance,"
which disposed of the French Revolution in 150 pages of mordant
frivolity; then Tuten's masterpiece to date, "Tintin in the New
World," which persists in the analysis and futility of revolution in
terms of figures from the old French comic strip; and six years ago,
"Van Gogh's Bad Cafe," whose romantic personnel steps out of those
sun-baked oils, foreshadowing some of the cultural and academic
altercations of this new book. I suspect that the readers this
exceptional writer deserves (he is frequently elegant and always
intelligent in his spiritual accounting; his arguments for and
against the course of passion and the life of the mind, no less) will
be startled and perhaps daunted by the strange elisions of naturalism
for the sake of philosophical position, and then by the even stranger
forsaking of Goya versus Poussin (the running academic argument
throughout the timeless "Green Hour") for the sake of what directors
call stage business. As Browning says, "What of soul was left, I
wonder, when the kissing had to stop?" Yet Hawthorne would have
abounded in the sense of this grim little romance, with all its
exotic filler (scenes of Parisian extravagance and Manhattan
prodigality), for the sake of its spooky radiance, for its
intensities of conduct in the war between life and art, and love and
death, and between knowing and believing. Once again, Tuten reaches
for another kind of fiction -- a lyric condition of the downward
spirit, in its mysterious connivance with its own wreck.</TE>

<TE>   "Once upon a time in Russia there really was a carefree, youthful

through the brave new world of post-glasnost advertising. Pelevin's
hard-boiled wonderland of a Moscow sits well next to Haruki
Murakami's Tokyo, Julio Cortazar's Paris and Terry Gilliam's Brazil.
All four writers have sci-fi-sized imaginations, literary backgrounds
and, most important, fierce grasps of their own morphing cultures and
languages. If Pelevin's Moscow is less sexual than the other capitals
(remarkable, given its reputation), that is only one more surprise
from this writer who continues to be one of the most energetic and

<TE>   Iceland</TE>
<TE>   Jim Krusoe</TE>
<TE>   Dalkey Archive: 182 pp., $14.95 paper</TE>
<TE>   Reading "Iceland," Jim Krusoe's slim and surreal first novel, is
rather like watching a gifted, self-assured magician perform a
routine in which the audience's willing-suspension-of-disbelief
threshold is constantly being reset higher and higher. It shouldn't
work. It can't work: Too many ironclad laws of fiction writing are
being casually violated on every page. Then, miraculously, the author
pulls it off, and you're left feeling dazzled, even breathless. This
is literature at its most audacious and imaginative but also at its
most coolly controlled. Krusoe is stylistically daring without being
self-consciously avant-garde; he's laugh-out-loud funny but never
lapses into contrived jokiness. Moreover, "Iceland" manages to be
that rarest of things: a novel of ideas that's unpretentious and
great fun to read. Somewhere up in heaven, Donald Barthelme, Joseph
Heller and John Gardner are looking down and smiling proudly. Krusoe
may be a magician, but it turns out he's one of those subversive
magicians who delights in exposing the artifice behind our cherished
illusions. In this case, the illusion he punctures is that each of us
is destined to be with someone else, the mystical "soul mate" of
Plato and poetry. In the last pages of this amazing novel, he paints
an almost Sartre-like picture of a man alone in the universe,
connected to no one but himself, belonging nowhere but inside his own
head. Comic surrealism gives way to a poignant depiction of a hard
truth too often lost on troubadours: The thousands of roads down
which we travel lead us, ultimately, to no one's home but our own.</TE>

<TE>   Since the fall of communism, Eastern and Central Europe have been
living in the time of returns. The region is supposed to be
returning, after decades of Soviet-imposed hibernation, to its
legitimate place in Europe and in Western civilization. There is a
rush of returning exiles, sometimes exiles' children, who spent the
better part of their lives abroad. Returning to this hitherto
fatalistic domain are the very notions of the future, of second
chances, of free choice but also of envy, loneliness and moral
ambiguity that can no longer be blamed on the "political system." All
those returns, and the tricks played by memory on people and nations
in transition, are the subject of "Ignorance," the new novel by Czech
writer Milan Kundera -- by far his most successful since "The
Unbearable Lightness of Being." In "Ignorance," which tells about the
impossibility of returns, he makes his own successful return to
familiar ground and to his old literary excellence. His irony and wit
are back on target, his characters vivid and convincing, his
intelligence no longer groping for a topic. So welcome back, Milan.

<TE>   Life of Pi</TE>
<TE>   Yann Martel</TE>
<TE>   Harcourt: 336 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   Yann Martel's "Life of Pi" is the literary version of a large,
friendly dog; hardly has it committed some mild offense than it
rebounds with such enthusiasm, impishness and charm that one promptly
forgives it. The book concerns the life of Piscine Molitor Patel
(self-christened Pi), an Indian boy growing up in Pondicherry in the
1970s. Pi's father is the director of the zoo at the Pondicherry
Botanical Garden, and the family lives within the idyllic, hothouse
peace of the zoo grounds until at last, in 1977, the political
situation in India forces them to sell off their animals and move to
Canada. On their way to Toronto, their ship -- a Japanese cargo ship
carrying, among other things, a Bengal tiger from the Pondicherry zoo
-- sinks, and all members of the Patel family, excluding Pi, are lost
at sea. A pocket summary of "Life of Pi" doesn't quite do the book
justice, however, because despite its constant episodes of tragedy
and suffering, the story is written with a lightness and humor that
gives it the quality of a fairy tale. It is a testament to Martel's
talent that his narrative never drags despite the fact that the
movement of time in "Life of Pi" is almost undetectable. All
incidents take place in a kind of vacuum, and in the hands of a
lesser craftsman, they would seem scattershot and random. What draws
us on is not plot in any chronological sense but rather the profound,
infectious sense of wonder that runs the length of the book. "Life's"
peculiar, slightly dreamlike cast eventually carries the reader to
the last of Pi's trials, a brief sojourn on an island floating,
apparently unmoored, in the middle of the sea. In a few short pages,
Martel sketches a cankered paradise that, in its quiet horror, rivals
the best of dystopian fiction. Equally haunting is the aftermath of
Pi's ordeal, the surprise of which shouldn't be ruined here. Suffice
to say that the ending contradicts the statement, made twice in the
book's introduction, that "Life of Pi" is "a story to make you
believe in God." Like Roberto Benigni's "Life Is Beautiful," it is
instead a story to make you believe in the soul-sustaining power of
fiction and its human creators, and in the original power of
storytellers like Martel.</TE>

<TE>   Little, Brown: 330 pp., $21.95</TE>
<TE>   The mere whisper of their names is painful -- Polly Klaas,
Danielle van Dam, Elizabeth Smart, Shanta Johnson -- for they
represent a parent's unspeakable heartache and a nation's vicarious
nightmare. They are the little girls, and girls are most at risk for
such mayhem. Some eventually are found dead; others simply disappear.
We read their stories, hear the soundbites and wonder: What really
happened to these lost girls? How on Earth do their families survive
the horror? How would we bear such a tragedy in our own households?
They are questions to which we seldom find answers, turning back
ultimately, gratefully, to our happier-by-comparison lives. Alice
Sebold, however, boldly steps into that unimaginable territory in her
first novel, "The Lovely Bones." Sebold's guide on the journey is
14-year-old Susie Salmon, who tells us she was murdered in 1973,
"before kids of all races and genders started appearing on milk
cartons ... back when people believed things like that didn't
happen." It is an oddly affecting coming-of-age novel, the story of a
girl who travels from the land of the living, through the in-between
space of her personal heaven, to a "wide wide Heaven" where she can
finally let go, "hold the world without me in it." Indeed, letting go
is a leitmotif of "The Lovely Bones," one that Sebold evokes with a
sly inventiveness and lyrical power that are deeply moving and
ultimately redemptive. With a well-balanced mix of heavenly humor,
Earthbound suspense and keen observation of both sides of Susie's
in-between, Sebold teaches us much about living and dying, holding on
and letting go, as messy and imperfect and beautiful as the processes
can be -- and has created a novel that is painfully fine and
accomplished, one that readers will have their own difficulties
relinquishing, long after the last page is turned.</TE>

<TE>   Nan A. Talese / Doubleday: 256 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   High-diving gamely into the pool of amnesia literature is Nicole
Krauss, whose first novel, "Man Walks Into a Room," is a startling
tale of a man so desperate for memories that he is willing to borrow
someone else's. The amnesiac owes his unique place in our fictions to
our curiosity about memory's relationship to identity and to
tantalizing questions about existential culpability: Are we anything
more than walking, talking accretions of empirical data? Are we
morally responsible for acts we don't remember committing? Playing
around with the tropes of amnesia allows a writer to remove a
character's overstuffed personal filing cabinet and see whether
there's anything like an actual soul hiding behind it. It's a device
that must tempt every novelist, though the rules of verisimilitude
(the condition is actually extremely rare) have frightened many of
them off and effectively pushed these stories to the fringes of genre
fiction. Krauss, however, isn't intimidated, and her novel is as
clever and poignant as it is fearless. It begins as noir, detours
into an Updike-like study of a doomed marriage, then veers off toward
paranoid sci-fi before entering the home stretch as a mournful
kaddish. "Man Walks Into a Room" is swirling with curious ideas and
enticing paradoxes. Krauss has written a novel that, unto itself, is

<TE>   Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux: 530 pp., $27</TE>
<TE>   Myths, whether ancient or modern, are basically designed to take
the vexing mysteries of the universe and reformulate them as stories
that make human sense. Jeffrey Eugenides has only two books to his
name; nevertheless, he's well on his way to becoming a spectacular
mythologist, attacking some of our most enduring riddles with heroic
energy, keen wit and genuine compassion. In his first novel, 1993's
"The Virgin Suicides," the riddle had to do with the
incomprehensibility of grief: how the bereaved secretly envy the dead
and long to join them. (What were the Lisbon sisters of that novel
but lip-glossed suburban Pleiades whose self-destruction only made
their stars shimmer that much more brightly?) In "Middlesex," his
long-awaited follow-up, the riddle is identity: how it develops, how
it's enforced and how gods and grandparents conspire to devise it
long before we're born. In significant ways, "Middlesex" -- a
transatlantic epic about a star-crossed Hellenic family, narrated by
an engagingly ironic hermaphrodite -- is the formal opposite of "The
Virgin Suicides." The latter was taut almost to the point of
astringency, though shot through with a dreamy, nocturnal surrealism.
Eugenides has had nearly a decade to relax, and the happy result is a
novel that's as warm, expansive and generous as its predecessor
wasn't. "Middlesex" is a towering achievement, and it can now be
stated unequivocally that Eugenides' initial triumph wasn't a one-off
or a fluke. He has emerged as the great American writer that many of
us suspected him of being.</TE>

<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf: 292 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   Richard Ford, who was raised in Mississippi and has spent a lot of
time in Montana, has hunted all his life. In the 10 cautionary tales
in his third collection of short stories, "A Multitude of Sins," Ford
brings a hunter's steady, subtle and precise observation to an
exploration of the commandment, "Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery." All
senses alert, the writer tracks the behaviors of America's wandering
unfaithful through the motels and hotels and bars where they come to
grips with their passions. There are echoes of Flannery O'Connor
here, in the harsh wit and preoccupation with good and evil, in the
author's willingness to let characters seem shallow, even despicable.
But Ford has moved beyond the small-town South to encompass the
comedy and pathos and wit of our dislocated times, the rhythms of the
workaday world and the emptiness that comes at the end of the day to
the lobbyist, the lawyer, the retired cop who dreams of starting over
again in East Whatever, Maine. With "A Multitude of Sins," which
reminds us how powerful short stories can be, Ford delivers a
piercing look at the ways men and women deceive and disappoint each
other.</TE>

<TE>   Nowhere Man</TE>
<TE>   Aleksandar Hemon</TE>
<TE>   Doubleday: 256 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   Sarajevo-born writer Aleksandar Hemon's debut, "The Question of
Bruno," (2000) was widely praised by critics -- even earning the
author comparisons to Vladimir Nabokov -- and with good reason.
Hemon's stories, chronicling the immigrant experience, were
satirical, painful, absurd and wrenching; they were all the more
remarkable for having been written in English, a language the author
had only recently adopted. In his best moments, Hemon proved himself
as inventive a writer as Nabokov or Salman Rushdie. He seemed, in
other words, to possess the kind of bold talent that doesn't come
around very often. And his follow-up book, "Nowhere Man,"
reintroduces readers to Jozef Pronek, the hapless protagonist of
"Blind Jozef Pronek &amp; Dead Souls," from "The Question of Bruno." Here
Jozef's entire life is laid out in a scattered, episodic fashion,
related by unreliable narrators and skipping back and forth in time.
Hemon again displays his prodigious gifts; nearly every sentence of
this novel is infused with energy and wit.</TE>

<TE>   Passing Strange</TE>
<TE>   Sally MacLeod</TE>
<TE>   Random House: 310 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   Pungently erotic, searingly violent and ultimately tragic, Sally
MacLeod's ambitious novel is a high-wire act, and she writes with
such devil-may-care abandon that you get the sense that she has no
need for a safety net. "Passing Strange" is a novel about plastic
surgery, infidelity, the New South, class resentment and interracial
sex. It's part "Madame Bovary" and part bus-station novel. And its
heroine, Claudia, is a melancholic soul who's as recklessly willful
as she is disturbingly passive. Born to a white working-class Vermont
family and painfully ugly, Claudia somehow snags a well-born New York
WASP husband, a lovable frat-boy jackass. When the unlikely couple
decide to move to North Carolina, he arranges radical surgery for
Claudia, and she is transformed, at least on the outside, into a
beauty: "this unearned esteem would weigh on me, and paw at me like
the hand of a beggar." Once in North Carolina, the new Claudia is
stunned by the local black population, by "rear ends like
Lycra-coated melons." When she starts meeting Calvin, the black
yardman, for illicit encounters in an abandoned farmhouse, she is
"perfected," and all hell breaks loose. With its sexual obsessions,
"Passing Strange" dares us to call it racist, but each page is full
of brave truths about everything from love, desire and family to
strip malls, country clubbers and even -- when this daring novel
heads for home -- the death penalty.</TE>

<TE>   The Piano Tuner</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Mason</TE>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf: 326 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   Burmese legend tells of the spirit, leip-bya, that flies at night
outfitted with the wings of a butterfly, according to a character in
"The Piano Tuner," the luminous, dreamscape novel by Daniel Mason.
"When a man sleeps, the leip-bya flies from his mouth and goes about
here and there, and sees things on its journey, and these are
dreams," Mason's character explains. "The leip-bya must always return
to a man by morning. This is why the Burmese don't want to wake
sleeping people. Perhaps the leip-bya is very far away, and it cannot
return home fast enough." Told with the competence of a seasoned
storyteller in almost old-fashioned prose, "The Piano Tuner" begins
in 1886 London when Edgar Drake, a quiet, keep-to-himself piano tuner
with a great love for Erard pianos, is summoned by the British War
Office. In service to the Crown, Drake is told, is one Surgeon-Major
Anthony Carroll, currently holding a provisional peace in the
southern Shan States of war-torn Burma. Some months earlier, the
surgeon-major had requested a rare 1840 Erard grand piano be
delivered to the compound. The military is highly suspicious of the
eccentric doctor-soldier's methods but is nonetheless convinced of
his success in keeping the peace. Though greeted with derision, his
piano requisition -- really an ultimatum, Drake learns -- was filled
in order to keep the good doctor happy enough to continue providing
his valuable services. (Carroll soothes the local warlords with
poetry, medical care and music, thereby earning their trust and
cooperation.) Once the piano arrived, though, it was painfully out of
tune and damaged from the arduous journey via elephant. Thus, the
doctor requires the services of an Erard expert, which is where Drake
comes in. "It's much easier to deliver a man than a piano," Carroll
has written in his request.</TE>
<TE>   Mason's writing achieves that kind of reverie in which every
vision, tone, flavor and sensation is magnified. The scenes are
rendered with resolute command, alive with lush metaphor, even if at
times Mason's plotting is a bit heavy-handed; we sometimes know
what's coming by his blunt foreshadowing. The moments of awkwardness
pass quickly, though: One dream scene makes way for the next until,
ultimately, Drake becomes stranded in the Burmese world of dreams,
his leip-bya so far afield that he cannot be awoken.</TE>

<TE>   Prague</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Phillips</TE>
<TE>   Random House: 374 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Hemingway and Fitzgerald wrote about the Lost Generation of
Americans who flocked to Paris after World War I, pursuing
stimulation beyond the bland boundaries of Middle America. In
"Prague," Arthur Phillips focuses on a new "lost generation" seeking
financial and personal fulfillment in post-communist Eastern Europe.
His young English-speaking expatriates land not in picture-perfect
"cash lavished" Prague but in Budapest, "this God-forsaken
paprika-stained Austrian test-market," also known, more flatteringly,
as "Paris on the Danube." Phillips' novel has scope, historical
perspective and complexity. His characters, who beach in "plucky,
unlucky Hungary" in 1990, just one year after the collapse of the
Berlin Wall, are more strivers than drifters and more jaded and
cynical than their earlier Parisan counterparts. They are members of
the "triumphant generation" who won the Cold War. They dream of
glistening, beckoning Prague but remain in Budapest. In relaying the
hardships suffered by his Hungarian characters, Phillips provides a
pointed contrast to his disaffected Americans. Phillips, who lived in
Budapest from 1990 to 1992 and now lives in Paris, shows an
expatriate's ability to see his fellow Americans from a critical
distance. The result is a substantive book that braves the cliches of
expat ennui to consider such issues as sincerity, scruples and the
vicissitudes of history.</TE>

<TE>   Red Poppies</TE>
<TE>   Alai</TE>
<TE>   Translated from the Chinese by Howard Goldblatt</TE>
<TE>   and Sylvia Li-chun Lin</TE>
<TE>   Houghton Mifflin: 434 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   "Red Poppies" is perhaps the first magical realist "Tibetan" novel
to reach the Western market. The publishers claim it is a book that
does for Tibet what the works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez have done for
Colombia. But a more direct parallel -- and a more illuminating
comparison -- might be to Salman Rushdie's "Midnight's Children."
"Red Poppies" has neither the stature nor complexity of "Midnight's
Children," but is it, as presented, a Tibetan novel, or is it a
hybrid? "Midnight's Children" is a post-colonial novel about India
written in English. "Red Poppies" is a novel set in a pre-colonized
Tibetan district, written in Chinese. "Red Poppies" stands on its own
literary merits, accessible to the reader without the historical
background or even a precise geographical fix on the novel's setting.
It stands up to comparison with other examples of contemporary
fiction in China -- where magical realism is enjoying a vogue, and
Alai has demonstrated that he can move from the short story to the
long form without losing his grip.</TE>

<TE>   Judith Freeman</TE>
<TE>   Pantheon Books: 336 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   It must be every bride's nightmare -- going home to meet your new
husband's seven other wives. But in Judith Freeman's "Red Water," set
in the Mormon West of the 1850s and '60s, it's only to be expected.
Emma Batchelor, English emigre and convert, marries the charismatic
John D. Lee, a real-life leader in the early church, and moves to a
remote settlement in the red lands of the Great Basin in this tale of
the sweat- and blood-soaked West. Moving fluidly backward and forward
in time, the novel opens in an especially solemn and graceful piece
of writing with Lee's execution by firing squad for a crime that is
never directly addressed. His mysterious crime hangs over the rising
action like the threat of a winter storm. "Red Water" delivers an
unforgettable portrait of the unceasing labor, passion and danger of
frontier life, recalling the best of Willa Cather. Freeman makes
vivid the ferocity it took to wrest a living from a wild red land and
makes inevitable the intensity of life among people who try. Her
evocation of the Great Basin, its harsh landscape of red rock and
twisted cypress and winters that come like an apocalypse forms the
perfect stage for this drama of love and faith and greed at the edge
of wilderness.</TE>

<TE>   Random House: 230 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   After circling the dark secret of her incestuous relationship with
her father in her first two novels, "Thicker Than Water" and
"Exposure," Kathryn Harrison confronted her demons head-on in the
memoir "The Kiss." Anyone who's read this eviscerating memoir about
her affair with her father won't be surprised by the icy intensity of
"The Seal Wife." Harrison is a beautiful stylist, a master of
spareness in the service of over-the-top obsessions. She is skilled
at seamlessly incorporating research into tales of sexual
compulsions. She is drawn to things that make most people squirm --
whether incest, foot-binding or her daughter's lice, which she wrote
about in the New Yorker. Her trademark is to examine these repellent
subjects minutely, without flinching, until she transforms them
through craft and precision into objects of morbidly beautiful
fascination. Harrison is a writer who might make you gasp but rarely
will make you laugh. But the most surprising aspect of this
mesmerizing tale about passion's capability to empower and deflate is
Harrison's subversion of our worst expectations.</TE>

<TE>   Ismail Kadare</TE>
<TE>   Translated from the French of Jusef Vrioni by David Bellos</TE>
<TE>   Arcade: 192 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   What is Albania? During the mid-1980s, our image was of a country
hunkered down behind the inscrutable wall of its Communist tyrant,
Enver Hoxha. Albania was the Tibet of Europe, swathed in fabrics of
language and culture unidentifiable to the uninitiated. The war in
Kosovo changed all that. CNN taught us that Albania was part of the
Balkans, that its people were part of a larger European Muslim
population (who knew there were Muslims in Europe?). But what did we
learn of Albanian culture, of Albanian writing? Ismail Kadare, born
in 1936, has spent a life fighting the twin enemies of Albania:
totalitarianism and superstition. As a storyteller, with a breezy
fluency, he solves his mysteries with a political and mythical flair
that includes an image of Leonid Brezhnev and the blind Oedipus Rex
stumbling out of the agora like a pair of vagabonds from a Bob Dylan
tune. At the end, gods and demons gone, the protagonist of "Spring
Flowers, Spring Frost" looks to the sky, "a sky bereft of its
masters, a sky in mourning stretching to infinity." It is an Albanian
sky that looks much like our own.</TE>

<TE>   The Story of Lucy Gault</TE>
<TE>   William Trevor</TE>
<TE>   Viking: 228 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   "Captain Everard Gault wounded the boy in the right shoulder on
the night of June the twenty-first, nineteen twenty-one." There is
something ripely short story-ish about the opening sentence of
William Trevor's novel, "The Story of Lucy Gault." The single shot
suggests a single plot -- a tale of revenge, perhaps, with the
precise date of a police blotter, fixed at a distant point in
history, an age of exotic names like Everard Gault.</TE>
<TE>   But it is a mark of Trevor's widely acknowledged mastery of the
numerous ways the English language can affect and manipulate the
human mind that he is able to turn this single shooting into a
complex and thoroughly extraordinary novel. Eventually the
distinction between perpetrator and victim, actor and acted-upon,
fades as time moves the story out of the mists of a past of dim
communication into a present age of telephones and e-mails. What
remains is tragedy, stubborn and unyielding, struggling for
satisfaction -- and the brilliant heroine that Trevor has created in
Lucy, as strong and solitary as Bronte's Cathy and Sophocles'
Antigone, but 10 times as resilient. A survivor. The search for
reconciliation, for a lasting peace, is as elusive, as Irish and
Catholic as it is human and Earth-wide. But the poetry of Trevor's
novel is aimed above politics, even if it strikes fully at the heart.</TE>

trying to get from Point A to Point B in one piece, with a certain
amount of grace. How to rate the 37th novel by an author who's in a
class by himself? Compare it to his previous work? "Tishomingo Blues"
is funnier than "Cuba Libre" but not as droll as "Get Shorty." Its
mise-en-scene isn't as hip as "Be Cool's," but it's more fun than
"Stick's." This novel is less poignant than "Pagan Babies," but it's

<TE>   Joanna Scott is one of today's best novelists, and she keeps
getting better. As a writer, she plays with traditional narrative
without being obscure or outrageous. Her details are placed in their
settings like gems in fine jewelry -- each has several facets: the
beautiful, the dangerous, the ominous and the familiar. This is the
story of a family that flees financial ruin by leaving the United
States for the island of Napoleon's exile: Elba. The father, Murray,
is charming and hopeless; the mother, Claire, is constant but
passionately in love with her husband; the four brothers are as wild
and independent as the children in Virginia Woolf's "The Waves." They
occupy their own world, parallel to the mysterious world of their
parents. Murray has an affair and is accused of killing a local girl.
The entire island turns against him. Events swirl in the minds and
memories of the boys. Claire struggles 43 years later to explain what
happened to Ollie, one of her sons. "The soft breeze of the sirocco.
The rustle of palm fronds. Piping of a nightingale. Two girls riding
bareback on the same brown horse." If that doesn't transport you, try

<TE>   "Unless," Carol Shields' 10th novel, is a thing of beauty --
lucidly written, artfully ordered, riddled with riddles and
undergirded with dark layers of philosophical meditations upon the
relative value of art, the realistic possibilities for women "who
want only to be fully human" and the nature of goodness, that
enduring human dilemma also worked thoroughly by Saul Bellow. What is
goodness? How can goodness survive in the face of evil? How should a
good woman -- or man -- live? "Unless" is a novel about a woman who
is writing a novel about a woman who writes. Shields plays with fact
and fiction, weaving in events such as the contested U.S. election of
2000, then gently putting them in their place. Her emphasis is on
emotional depth as well as dazzling wordplay. In this consummately
artistic and poignant novel, Shields touches gently upon some of
life's harshest surprises, acknowledges the fleetingness of happiness
and reminds us how precious life is.</TE>

<TE>   "Has it ever occurred to you one may be artificial by nature?"
Tristan's cry from the heart is also a cry from the author's heart,
for James McCourt is a brilliant practitioner of what Cyril Connolly
called the Mandarin style. Its aim, according to Connolly (who cited
the later novels of Henry James as avatar of the style), was "to make
the written word as unlike as possible to the spoken one." But, as
Oscar Wilde anticipated, its other equally important aim was to turn
the comedy of manners into a medium for subverting manners and
morals. Wilde's most direct descendant, Ronald Firbank, did the same
thing in his novels of the 1920s, "The Flower Beneath the Foot" and
"Concerning the Eccentricities of Cardinal Pirelli."</TE>
<TE>   McCourt is Firbank's most direct (and more robust) descendant,
even more unafraid to extend the boundaries of what is permissible to
laugh at and to reject conventional narrative. In terms of direct
action, not much happens, but a lot goes on in terms of dialogue
(including reported action) and interior monologue. These characters
live from private moment to private moment and from one epiphany to
another, sudden revelations of happiness, absurdity, hope, pain. By
taking an unfamiliar route to familiar problems (of love, death,
identity), McCourt is also saying who he is by how he gets there; and
in his case, both the journey and the arrival matter, because both
are equally startling.</TE>

<TE>   Ward Just writes the kind of books they say no one writes anymore:
smart, well-crafted narratives -- wise to the ways of the world --
that use fiction to show us how we live. The kind of books, in fact,
that most novels tried to be before confession and dysfunction cut
their wide swath across the literary landscape. His books are
conventional, perhaps, but still the gleam in the eye of every
journalist who, in the folklore and like Just himself, traded in the
city desk for a battered typewriter in a room somewhere (Paris,
preferably) to wrestle his prose into a semblance of real life.
Cynical on the outside, Bogart romantic on the inside, Just even has
the rumpled lived-in features that would look perfect in a trench
coat. But he gave the cliche new life by writing the books the others
just talked about writing. And he keeps getting better. "The Weather
in Berlin" is his 13th novel, after "A Dangerous Friend" and the
excellent "Echo House," and one of his finest. It has so many of the
pleasures of a conventional good read that you may not notice, at
least for a while, the ambition and mastery poking modestly between
the lines. It has the feel of spending an evening with someone who
talks very well and knows what he's talking about. That is not all
fiction can do, but sometimes it can count for a lot. If you haven't

<TE>   Translated from the Italian by John Casey</TE>
<TE>   with Maria Sanminiatelli</TE>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf: 182 pp., $18</TE>
<TE>   In one of Alessandro Boffa's gloriously wacky Ovidian meditations
on sex, death and identity, "You're an Animal, Viskovitz!," the
shape-changing creature Viskovitz has metamorphosed into a
multicellular organism who meets his Maker and is forced to confront
the best and the worst of animal life. In the shape of an unassuming
Archeozoic era plasmodium, Viskovitz comes face to face with the
"primordial Microbe" and discovers that life as an animal has much to
offer him: the opportunity to kill and devour others; the chance to
"[f]ind someone you like and exchange some DNA"; and the possibility
that one day you will be able to indulge in an entertaining game
called "survival of the fittest." If animal life also carries with it
the certainty of death, this is part of the fun.</TE>
<TE>   In "You're an Animal, Viskovitz!" Boffa revels in the bawdy and
grim details of the animal kingdom, following Viskovitz as he takes
the shape of a magnificent array of animals, from a narcissistic
snail and a power-hungry ant to a sex-starved sponge and a
heroin-addicted dog. The battle between the animal impulses
hard-wired into rat, dormouse, dung beetle or bull-elk and the human
desire for something better is at the heart of "You're an Animal,
Viskovitz!" Boffa takes us on a comic and revelatory romp through the
anthills, cages, sewers and dens of the animal world, producing a
hilarious portrait of Viskovitz and his friends as they experience
the pleasures and dangers of an animal life that all too often
resembles our own.</TE>

<BD>Richard Schickel's memoir, "Good Morning Mr. Zip Zip
Zip," will be published in the spring by Ivan R. Dee.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most picture books about the movies remind me of nothing so much as
big, dopey, epic movies. They are full of pretty people doing silly
things. They are overlong, overproduced and under-thought. They are
all imagery -- mostly of half-forgotten stars hanging around on
locations, proving that fame is no defense against boredom, or caught
like deer in the headlights by an old-fashioned paparazzo's flashbulb
-- unattended by even the most primitive ideas. They are, in their
way, the perfect symbols of a popular culture that devotes too much
of its time and treasure to wretched excess and idle nostalgia, all
the while avoiding anything that resembles critical thought about
itself.</LD>
<LD>   Except, of course, for the exceptions, about which we may risk
this generalization: the best illustrated books about film -- or
perhaps any other subject -- either devote themselves to wide-ranging
study of a single figure or topic or they represent the collected
work of a singular and passionate photographic artist. In either
case, something obsessive energizes the work and rescues it from the
more typical life of the picture book: two hours in the lap on
Christmas afternoon, two lonely decades on the lower shelves of the
guest bedroom.</LD>
<TE>   This year there are three excellent examples -- and alas, only
three -- of what I'm talking about, of which my favorite is
Christiane Kubrick's wonderful picture book about her late husband,
Stanley. It achieves a nice balance between his family life and his
professional life, but, of course, everything revolves around Kubrick
himself. The book's first photo of the director-to-be shows him,
about age 5, on a family outing in the country. He's a cute little
tyke wearing shorts, shirt, white shoes and socks and -- odd note
here -- a necktie. But those are not the first elements you read in
this simple, fatherly composition. What transfixes you are his eyes:
round and large and focused on something up and to the left, out of
frame. They will be the dominant element in virtually every picture
of Kubrick this book reproduces.</TE>
<TE>   They are, very occasionally, reposeful but, even then, fully
alert. Mostly they seem to be thirstily drinking things in -- the
scene he's shaping, the actor or technician (or child) he's talking
to, certainly -- but something more, as well, something he could not
quite anticipate or describe, but which, should it occur, he would
recognize.</TE>
<TE>   Kubrick was, of course, a nut about lenses -- those artificial
eyes that could, when properly deployed, reveal things beyond human
vision. You get the feeling as you page through this book that his
bug-eyed stare was an attempt to turn himself into an optical system
that could peer into a soul or, alternatively, the universe, and
search out its secrets. I don't suppose he very often managed to do
that. For he also knew that most of the souls he encountered were
bent and that the cosmos was ruled by chance. But, yes, he was a
camera, and the images he recorded -- so beautiful, so disturbing --
haunt us as no other director's do. And this picture book satisfies
my curiosity about him as, I suspect, no biography ever will.</TE>
<TE>   "Charlie Chaplin: A Photo Diary" is like the Kubrick book in that
it stresses only one element of a complex man's character; in
Chaplin's case, it is his loneliness. I don't mean to imply that he
is seen alone in these beautifully reproduced photos. Sometimes he is
surrounded by vast crowds. Sometimes he is caught in smaller groups
-- typically the casts and crews of his films. Sometimes he simply
greets a lone celebrity visiting his studio. But often these are gag
photos, staged merriment, revealing nothing to us but his eagerness
to satisfy his innocent audience's belief that funny men must lead
funny lives.</TE>
<TE>   Chaplin gives himself fully to this conceit. He seems, in fact,
happy to hide himself within it. And why not? He was, for a very long
time, the most famous man in the world. Better for him to provide an
easily assimilated image than complicated explanations. But yet there
is something tense in these poses -- something very different from
the heedless, dancing grace he achieved on the screen with his Little
Tramp character. Only when he is with his third wife -- bright,
pretty, sexy Paulette Goddard -- does he seem fully relaxed, fully
human, and there are more pictures of Chaplin with her than with
anyone else -- even his last wife, the beloved Oona, with whom he
passed many more years. Interestingly, even in his late years, when
most of the pictures of Chaplin were taken by friends and family, he
was still imagining, and striking, funny poses -- there's a great
snap of him playing Napoleon -- still hiding in plain sight.</TE>
<TE>   We are left with this irony: Kubrick, widely, erroneously thought
to be reclusive, opened a significant aspect of himself to the
camera; Chaplin, a much more public man, revealed little of himself
to it. Which does not make this book, drawn from his family's
archives, any less fascinating to ponder. This was an artist who,
perhaps uniquely among the great figures of the 20th century, used
himself as a canvas, coolly creating what was surely a misleading
self-portrait yet one that for a long time fully satisfied the
world's curiosity. You can spend hours peering at this handsome
record of his duplicity and never fully solve the mystery of Charles
Spencer Chaplin.</TE>
<TE>   To a lesser degree, all actors try their hand at Chaplin's game.
And it is the usual business of their portraitists to penetrate their
fictions, to give us the "real" man or woman behind the image. That,
however, is not Brigitte Lacombe's business. This first collection of
the French photographer's work is much more interesting and, in a
certain sense, enigmatic. No captions accompany her pictures; her
subjects are identified only at the back of her book. No problem, you
say. These actors, directors and writers are, after all, very famous
people. But you would be wrong. Only the very strongest faces are
instantly recognizable in these pages. The rest you have to study for
a while before you can put a name to them. And sometimes, frankly,
you scramble for the cheat sheets.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally this is because they have adopted a disguising
hairstyle for a role. Once or twice sunglasses come into play. But
mostly Lacombe plays to their desire for anonymity. They are caught
with their eyes closed or their hands to their faces or with their
faces slightly averted. Even when they stare straight at her camera,
their very intensity sometimes transforms them into only vaguely
recognizable individuals. The effect is, finally, quite wondrous, for
at her best Lacombe restores to these celebrities their common
humanity. We would be drawn to them even if they were not famous.</TE>
<TE>   These pictures are, of course, influenced by the Stanislavskian
system of self-presentation -- with its sober insistence on
psychological reality, on not being openly glamorous, on submerging
the actor's personality in his or her role. But many of them go
further. What a lot of these portraits do, I think, is take their
subjects back beyond the myths and misunderstandings that accumulate
around performers when they start appearing in public and we start
adoring them. They return their subjects to their essences, even to a
kind of innocence.</TE>
<TE>   What we're talking here is a form of postmodernism, in that it
banishes "image" and embraces the ambiguities, the mysteries, that
are anonymity's largest reward -- not to mention the hostility that
is often hinted at in celebrity portraiture. The intimacy Lancombe
achieves does not feel intrusive; it feels more like a friendly,
passing moment. One thinks Charlie Chaplin might have enjoyed posing
for her, allowing his guard to drop, his genius for misdirection to
take a brief timeout.</TE>

<LD>Blood of Victory</LD>
<LD>   Alan Furst</LD>
<LD>   Random House: 288 pp., $24.95</LD>
<TE>   In Alan Furst's latest, it is November 1940. Victorious in both
East and West, the Germans are trying to bomb Britain into submission
and are gearing up to invade Russia. Serebin, a Russian emigre writer
living in German-occupied Paris, boards a Bulgarian freighter from
the Romanian port of Constanta to Istanbul. He is part of a circus of
British-run amateur spies chugging through southeastern Europe --
Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and France. Objective: to deny the
Germans use of the Romanian oil crucial to their tanks and planes.
Oil is the "blood of victory," and Furst charts the Keystone Kop-like
endeavors of Serebin and company to sabotage the Germans through a
Luna Park of varied bloodlettings.Furst is a master
atmosphere-spinner. Understated sentiment, deprecatory charm,
digressions aplenty, more nuances than action, more subtlety than
slaughter, hints, nudges, whispers and incredible stories one would
like to believe are the ingredients of his style. The recipe has
worked before, and here it works again. Who would want to complain?</TE>

<TE>   Chasing the Dime</TE>
<TE>   Michael Connelly</TE>
<TE>   Little, Brown: 400 pp., $25.95</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time, the respectable classes looked upon crime as
shocking -- on the eruption of violence in everyday life as
exceptional, on a body found in the library astonishing. In a society
in which the FBI's Uniform Crime Report for 2001 records 15,980
homicides for the year, a corpse is less astonishing than a library,
crime is routine, respectability a volatile variable and events --
with all their chads left hanging -- tend to be unaccountable and
opaque. Michael Connelly is a compelling conjurer of chaos theory
adjusted to breaking news, and his "Chasing the Dime" is a stunning
exercise in suspense and sci-fi technomagickry.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Darker Justice</TE>
<TE>   Sallie Bissell</TE>
<TE>   Bantam: 352 pp., $22.95</TE>
<TE>   Sallie Bissell's "A Darker Justice" is another page-turner: a
chiller that delivers thrills as fast as it telegraphs them. Someone
is knocking off federal judges and we know why. A coven of religious
lunatics and rich, powerful men is scheming to get richer and more
powerful still by getting a television preacher elected president.
They have been offing congressional incumbents for years and getting
their own candidates elected in their stead. Now they have cooked up
a wacky prediction and broadcast it on the Internet: When it is
fulfilled and the last judge is purged, it should bolster the
electoral fortunes of their candidate for the White House.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hell to Pay</TE>
<TE>   George P. Pelecanos</TE>
<TE>   Little, Brown: 288 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Walter Scott defined the novel as a fictitious narrative
accommodated to the ordinary train of human events, which is why
novels, in their 18th and 19th century heyday, were social novels.
Then they became literary novels characterized by form, not content,
their primary virtue being inaccessibility. The major remaining
representatives of old-style novels are detective stories, mysteries
and thrillers, which still tell tales of action "accommodated to the
ordinary train of human events." George P. Pelecanos does this very
well, and his "Hell to Pay" is a terrific thriller, a rip-roaring
read. It is also a mine of information about cultures and subcultures
in our land, specifically in Washington, D.C. The plot is intricate,
fast-cut, fast-moving, compelling and perfectly satisfying. The voice
of Pelecanos -- raspy, brutal, vivid, moving -- is one not to forget.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the Clear</TE>
<TE>   Steve Lopez</TE>
<TE>   Harcourt: 356 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   "In the Clear" is a howl. Steve Lopez probably overdoes the
hilariousness, but reading him is too much fun to notice, let alone
to mind. A Los Angeles Times columnist, Lopez introduces us to Albert
La Rosa, sheriff of a small town, Harbor Light, on the New Jersey
shore. Bored from a diet of nothing-much-doing, Albert is
middle-aged, graying at the edges, tired round the eyes, weary of
playing it safe. Then he's offered a job as chief of security at a
new casino to be built in town and all hell breaks loose. The
prospect of Atlantic City moving in splits the little town. Albert's
friends turn against him. The listless world of Harbor Light is
vivified but threatened. So is Albert. Will his sister's warning that
there are no fresh starts in life, just new opportunities to screw
up, prove right? No chance. Albert fends off both filthy lucre and
his rutted groove to solve the mysteries and live as a free spirit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Last Temptation</TE>
<TE>   Val McDermid</TE>
<TE>   St. Martin's Minotaur: 448 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Double-cross and double-dealing on all sides, traffic in drugs,
videos and human beings, kidnapping, smuggling, murder, rape, lies,
betrayal, impostures, evasions, pursuits, snares and pitfalls throng
Val McDermid's "The Last Temptation" and set its feverish pace. A
ruthless international trafficker and an equally ruthless but more
impenetrable psychopathic serial killer are being tracked by British,
German and Dutch police forces and by Europol, but especially by Tony
Hill, a psychologist-profiler, and his once-and-again partner, Det.
Chief Inspector Carol Jordan. When you lie down with dogs, you get up
with fleas. As Tony and Carol struggle to unravel the web of danger
and deceit they're caught up in, to save their threatened lives and
help each other, the syncopated plot leads them to Berlin and along
the Rhine. The apparently separate cases interweave to carry them
through a crime-streaked string of startling incidents, adventures
and misadventures. Relentless, electric and absorbing, this is a
thriller not to miss.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Only Child</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Vachss</TE>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf: 288 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   As Andrew Vachss' "Only Child" opens, his antihero, Burke, has
been on the run for years. Now he returns to New York City and has to
make a living. He is recruited by two Mafia barons to riddle out the
culprit and the motive for the horrific murder of a 16-year-old Long
Island girl. His investigation carries him deep into teenage culture,
Internet effervescence, furtive filmmaking and kinky sex. With
Vachss, atmosphere is all, and the atmosphere here is grungy and
ominous, the wardrobe lurches between louche sloppiness and plain
uglification, weather is sullen, light bleary, mood murky, settings
sullied and action ruthlessly blunt. Vachss' style is personal,
laconic, shaded and, of course, creepy. If you like hard-boiled punk
narrative, this is a read for you.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Put a Lid On It</TE>
<TE>   By Donald E. Westlake</TE>
<TE>   Mysterious Press: 248 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   Donald E. Westlake's "Put a Lid on It" is a great caper, fast-cut
and facetious, about the interface between politics and crime, which
have a lot in common, as we know. As the book opens, Francis Xavier
Meehan, a recidivist thief, is held for a federal crime in the
Manhattan Correctional Center. When it closes, he's looking for
rehabilitation, preferably in the company of his lawyer, Mrs.
Goldfarb. In between, Meehan robs the rich to give to the richer (and
keep a little for himself).</TE>
<TE>   The president has recklessly given away sensitive intelligence
affecting national security and the security of others. Neither the
lapse nor the bloody mess it caused would matter much if the
indiscretion did not teeter on the brink of exposure. Only expert
intervention can save the president's bacon and the forthcoming
election. Meehan provides it, and his ramble 'twixt the two points is
great fun. Scenes that are not hilarious are breathless; scenes that
aren't whimsical are nimble. Mostly, though, they're all of the
above. Sometimes Westlake's farces are better than the ones they put
on in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Veteran</TE>
<TE>   Five Heart-Stopping Stories</TE>
<TE>   Frederick Forsyth</TE>
<TE>   St. Martin's Press: 368 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Frederick Forsyth is the author of 10 page-turners that include
such bestsellers as "The Day of the Jackal" and "The Odessa File." He
also believes, as does his namesake Federico Fellini, that reality
distorts. Forsyth's realities are false fronts: Apparent factuality
is there to ensnare; straightforward narrative decoys unwary readers
into authorial ambush. In "The Veteran," he offers not one more novel
but five long stories cleverly crafted to string us along to the
sting in their tail. Lucid, vivid and delightfully readable, Forsyth
is a master wordsmith and a master of meticulous detail too.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reversible Errors</TE>
<TE>   Scott Turow</TE>
<TE>   Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux: 448 pp., $36</TE>
<TE>   Scott Turow's "Reversible Errors," is about ambition, affection,
attraction, hope, anger and dissembling; about two love affairs
blundering toward resolution; and about the power of law, which, at
its drabbest, is about words on a page and tricks of a trade but also
about life and death. In the end, law saves lives or ruins them or
ends them. Or perhaps people do. Turow's people are as slippery and
mutable as the law in practice. Turow has constructed a mazy,
tortuous tale, as easy to misread as it is to read. In legal
parlance, reversible error is a mistake so significant that an
appellate court must reverse the judgment that was based on it. But
errors may prove more reversible in court than they are in life.
Crooks and criminals may yet be pardoned: saved. Can error-prone,
self-destructive, unimpeachable adults hope for as much?</TE>

<LD>American Ground</LD>
<LD>   Unbuilding the World Trade Center</LD>
<LD>   William Langewiesche</LD>
<TE>   North Point Press: 206 pp., $22</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks ago, taking advantage of the recently restored
service on the No. 1 subway line, I rode past the World Trade Center
stop on my way down to Rector Street. Imposing metallic barriers have
been erected at the edge of the platforms to block the passenger's
vista. I was reminded of the zombie-like quality of the abandoned
East Berlin U-Bahn stations en route to the checkpoint at
Friedrichstrasse before the Berlin Wall's fall. An eerie calm
prevails in the dry, empty subway tunnel, and, were it not for the
thunder of memory, one would pay no attention to the shuttered
station platform under what William Langewiesche poignantly calls
"American Ground." The moral and technical challenge of getting down
to that ground in the wake of the attacks is the subject of
Langewiesche's remarkable account. Langewiesche sets himself the task
of recounting in sober prose how engineers and workers set about the
overwhelming labor of clearing 1.5 million tons of debris from the
devastated site. Teeming with paradoxes and ironies, "American
Ground" accomplishes the rare feat of restoring the unimaginable
trauma to the events of Sept. 11 and of presenting the everyday
heroism of those who cleared the site of its rubble.</TE>

<TE>   American Law</TE>
<TE>   in the 20th Century</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence M. Friedman</TE>
<TE>   Yale University Press: 722 pp., $35</TE>
<TE>   It took guts plain and simple for Lawrence M. Friedman to write
"American Law in the 20th Century." This is a topic of monumental
scope, encompassing revolutionary changes in every aspect of law,
from the rules regulating marriage to the basic structure of the U.S.
government. Fortunately for those who seek an enlightening guide to
this country's modern legal history, Friedman, a professor at
Stanford Law School, has erudition and style as well as guts. His
achievement is stunning and definitive. Each of Friedman's chapters
is jampacked with information and perspective. Other keys to
Friedman's success are his abilities to identify the seminal case,
the vital personae, the meaningful statistic and the watershed moment
and to accompany these choices with a lively and insightful narrative
description. Admirably, Friedman never forgets that the characters
and stories that color our legal history -- the giants like Oliver
Wendell Holmes, who dominated legal thinking for a generation, or a
tragedy like the Birmingham church bombing, which shamed a nation --
are part of a larger social context. Indeed, Friedman's greatest
accomplishment may well be that, despite his obvious passion for the
law, he repeatedly instructs (and illustrates) that the power of law
to change society is dwarfed by the power of society to change the
law.</TE>

<TE>   American Studies</TE>
<TE>   Louis Menand</TE>
<TE>   Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux: 306 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Louis Menand won a Pulitzer for his history of American
pragmatism, "The Metaphysical Club." Now Menand has published
"American Studies," a collection of essays written over the last
decade, covering everything from America's founding modernist,
William James, to America's favorite smut magnate, Larry Flynt. For
all the success of its predecessor, "American Studies" should not be
mistaken for an afterthought: It represents the heart of Menand's
work (he is essentially an essayist) and demonstrates his status as
his generation's premier critical talent. It is easily among the
finest collections of essays by an American critic since Lionel
Trilling's "The Liberal Imagination."</TE>

<TE>   The Anthropology of Turquoise</TE>
<TE>   Meditations on Landscape, Art, and Spirit</TE>
<TE>   Ellen Meloy</TE>
<TE>   Pantheon: 326 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   "The craving for turquoise is universal," suggests Ellen Meloy.
"Turquoise is capricious, it is alluring, no one leaves the Southwest
without it, although its life seems to flee from it when it is
removed from the bare, blood-red sandstone of its native land." In
"The Anthropology of Turquoise," her exquisitely rendered meditation,
Meloy considers all that might be linked to the spirit of turquoise:
the gem-like mineral itself, the myriad stops on the spectrum that
comprise the color's amplitude and the metaphors she finds in this
blue-green color -- metaphors of place, of peace, of the restfulness
of the ocean, the silence of the desert, the life-giving waters of
the rivers, even the respite of suburban swimming pools.</TE>
<TE>   In this compilation of 15 densely written, highly poetic essays,
Meloy takes readers on a sensual travel narrative. On the Colorado
Plateau, exploring light and color, she tries to recapture, through
crayons and watercolors, a sense of her deceased brother's existence.
In Sequoia, she ponders family ties to a piece of land. The Bahamas
serve as backdrop for her investigation into the landscape and slave
history of the islands. Throughout, her writing is steeped in color,
nearly squawking with life.</TE>

<TE>   "Aquariums of Pyongyang" is the first book to appear in the West
describing firsthand the hard-labor concentration camps in North
Korea, where 150,000 to 200,000 people are imprisoned. When Kang
Chol-hwan was 10, in 1978, he and his family were sent to a camp to
be "reeducated." His grandparents were wealthy North Korean
Communists living in Japan, who returned with their children to North
Korea because Chol-hwan's grandmother was especially committed to its
communist future. Instead, she was brought, after her husband's
mysterious disappearance, to Yodok, North Korea's largest camp. This
is where Chol-hwan and his sister, father, grandmother and uncle
spent 10 years (other family members were "excused" for various
reasons). When his family was released in 1987, Chol-hwan found
himself in danger of being arrested again for listening to "banned
radio." In 1992, he escaped to South Korea via China, one of few who
managed to escape before the famine in North Korea reached its peak.
He is now a journalist in Seoul. "All during my childhood," Kang
writes, "Kim Il Sung [North Korea's leader] had been like a god to
me. A few years in the camp cured me of my faith."</TE>

<TE>   Bad Blood</TE>
<TE>   A Memoir</TE>
<TE>   Lorna Sage</TE>
<TE>   William Morrow: 288 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   An influential literary critic, professor at the University of
East Anglia and biographer of novelist Angela Carter, Lorna Sage had
an active career cut short by an untimely demise. The 57-year-old
Sage died of emphysema and related infections in January 2001. But
she did live long enough to complete the book that won her the 2000
Whitbread Biography Award: "Bad Blood," a scintillating memoir of
three generations, now published in the United States. Few otherwise
lamentable situations are richer in comic potential than a truly
rotten marriage -- to outsiders, anyway, if not to the participants.
The adolescent Lorna must have been a difficult customer: obstinate,
self-willed, hard to reach. (She claims that for years she was
actually unable to tell time.) As befits a future literary critic,
she had an insatiable appetite for all kinds of books. Afflicted with
insomnia, she would stay up all night reading and much preferred
imaginary worlds to the one in which she lived. At the same time, she
was entranced with the emerging teenage pop culture, desperately
seeking Elvis-like traits in the boys she met. Her first romance, so
to speak, is quite an unusual one that might well be used to make a
case for mandatory sex education courses. Written with shrewd insight
and enormous verve, Sage's evocative, enthralling, often hilarious
memoir accomplishes the two goals of its particular genre, summoning
up the general spirit of a time and place while conveying a keen
sense of uniqueness.</TE>

<TE>   Or, Investing in Life: The History and Future of Pensions</TE>
<TE>   Robin Blackburn</TE>
<TE>   Verso: 550 pp., $30</TE>
<TE>   One can hardly pick up a newspaper without reading about some
company terminating, reshaping or skimming its pension fund. Or, for
that matter, about some state or municipal retirement system losing
hundreds of millions of dollars from the collapse of Enron and
WorldCom stocks and bonds. Washington is not pushing major new
pension safeguards. In part, that's because administration
policymakers are still caught up in the 1990s bubble illusion that
Social Security should be partly privatized, putting some of its
revenues into the eager hands of America's financial services
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Given their recent record, this no longer makes sense, and some
new thinking is in order. Maybe a lot of new thinking. These facts
make "Banking on Death," Robin Blackburn's book on the history and
future of pensions, more timely and important reading than we could
have guessed a year ago. No one interested in pension finance or
pension rights can afford to miss it.</TE>

<TE>   Humanitarianism in Crisis</TE>
<TE>   David Rieff</TE>
<TE>   Simon &amp; Schuster: 384 pp., $26</TE>
<TE>   David Rieff, a journalist and author of four previous books,
including "Slaughterhouse: Bosnia and the Failure of the West," has
become a category of critic unto himself. He spent the last decade
roaming the world's conflict zones and refugee camps, often with the
aid of the aid givers themselves, making himself the most forceful
and, in the nongovernmental aid world, influential exposer of the
institutional contradictions, hidden agendas and confusion of roles
among those who have enlisted in what fellow critic Alex de Waal has
called the "Humanitarian International."</TE>
<TE>   Rieff is an outsider's insider, one who can identify the perverse
consequences of and the dangerous hubris behind humanitarian
intrusions in needy societies but who doesn't bring the defensiveness
of a stakeholder. In his provocative polemic, "A Bed for the Night:
Humanitarianism in Crisis," Rieff offers us the big picture -- and
oh, what a dispiriting picture it is. Rieff writes that the apparent
"triumph" of humanitarianism in the 1990s -- the decision by
frustrated aid workers to urge governmental intervention and of
governments to dabble in humanitarian work -- has proved, "both
morally and operationally, to be a poisoned chalice." The meaning and
mandate of humanitarian relief work has been so distorted by mission
creep that the aid industry stands "verging on cognitive and moral
meltdown." The rescuers, Rieff suggests, are in dire need of rescue,
less from the world's evil-doers than from themselves.</TE>

<TE>   "Benjamin Franklin" reflects its origins, relying almost entirely
on Franklin's letters and printed works. It also reflects Edmund S.
Morgan's scholarly interests. Morgan, a professor emeritus of history
at Yale, has authored several distinguished volumes on the American
Colonial experience and the social and intellectual construction of
an American identity therein. Franklin provides Morgan with a
revealing case study; by examining Franklin's changing views on
citizenship, obligation, empire and authority, Morgan goes far toward
explaining America's decision for independence from Britain. For an
introduction to the mind of Franklin -- one of the most inquisitive,
productive and engaging minds of his or any other day -- readers

<TE>   Travels With Cranes</TE>
<TE>   Peter Matthiessen</TE>
<TE>   North Point Press: 350 pp., $27.50</TE>
<TE>   At the end of "The Birds of Heaven," the author stands in a
savanna, "staring at the first wild whooping crane born in the United
States in sixty years...." The moment represents the culmination of
five years of travel across four continents in pursuit of "the
greatest of the earth's flying birds," but it is a curiously subdued,
even ironic, triumph. The "wild" whooper chick is, in fact, the
offspring of pen-raised birds that are part of a nonmigratory flock
artificially and arduously established on the Florida peninsula,
which was never part of their natural range. Three weeks after the
sighting of this precarious symbol of ecological restoration, the
chick's decapitated and mangled body was found, the victim of a
bobcat. This scene encapsulates many of the sensibilities that inform
this latest book from Peter Matthiessen. "The Birds of Heaven" is
essentially a travel journal, chronicling his encounters with the
ever-shrinking remnants of Earth's wild places and pre-industrial
societies. His aim here was to see all 15 of the world's crane
species in the wild, birds that Matthiessen considers to be "umbrella
species," whose status is indicative of broad environmental health
and whose fate is thus linked to ours. Writing polemic and poetry at
once is not an easy task, and Matthiessen is at his best when writing
about the cranes themselves. His treatment of Japan's famous
red-crowned cranes, for instance, contains superb, luminous
description that both demonstrates his considerable literary powers
and helps us understand why indigenous cultures worldwide have made
cranes symbols and heralds of the more transcendent aspects of the
human spirit.</TE>

<TE>   The Blank Slate</TE>
<TE>   The Modern Denial of Human Nature</TE>
<TE>   Steven Pinker</TE>
<TE>   Viking: 510 pp., $27.95</TE>
<TE>   Steven Pinker, best-selling author of "The Language Instinct" and
"How the Mind Works," has written a big book, "The Blank Slate," that
is built like a bouncer, and it needs to be. "Human nature is human
nature" is not the kind of tautology some people are willing to take
lying down. For ideological reasons, clever people can still deny
that their brains -- but not their eventual contents or use -- are
shaped by their parents' genes. The unreasonable fear is that to
concede unwanted truths will leave mankind with no logical resistance
to fascism, capitalism, racism, religious obscurantism, male
dominance and the rest. If Locke's theory generated democracy, how
can rejecting it not rehabilitate tyranny? Part of Pinker's mission
is to repeat that there is no inescapable correlation between facts
and human value systems, good or bad. Pinker presents an unanswerable
case for accepting that man can be, as he is, both wired and free.
Genes do not determine how we use our minds, only the kinds of minds
we have. No one has to propagate fairy tales in order to justify a
better world. Ashley Montagu's UNESCO resolution, stating that
biology supports an ethic of "universal brotherhood" is as baseless
as Rousseau's myth of the noble savage. Man is good and bad; man is
loving and savage; man is thoughtful and impulsive. The ingredients
vary with genetic inheritance. Too bad if that doesn't suit left- or
right-wing utopians, but the good news is that man is unrivaled in
ingenuity and in ability to learn and adapt. An individual mind can
be closed (or held shut); the book of knowledge, and hence society
itself, can never be. What we certainly need are critics -- as Pinker
himself is -- of reckless conclusions drawn from statistics or from
anything else. Such characters used to be the fruit of what was known
as the humanities. And "The Blank Slate" -- at once tolerant and
polemic, uncompromising and open-minded -- offers a notable and
instructive contribution to them. As a brightly lighted path between
what we would like to believe and what we need to know, it is
required reading.</TE>

<TE>   Brown</TE>
<TE>   The Last Discovery of America</TE>
<TE>   Richard Rodriguez</TE>
<TE>   Viking: 234 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   "Brown" is a meditation on America's family secrets. It is a
lyrical hymn on the tenebrous side of history, one not marked by
triumphs or defeats but by entanglements born of eroticism and,
sometimes, love. It is at once a homily on the dangers of puritanism
in an impure world and the confession of an aging baby boomer who has
given up trying to reconcile the contradictory elements of his
American soul. Richard Rodriguez calls this long-awaited collection
of essays the third of a trilogy on "American public life and my
private life." Though "Hunger of Memory" (1982) and "Days of
Obligation" (1992) were, respectively, about class and ethnicity,
"Brown" presumes to be about race. But race is only the book's point
of departure. Rodriguez's meditation on the meanings of brown -- a
color whose essential beauty and mystery, he says, derive from the
fact that it is a mixture of other colors -- is also an exploration
of American culture in an era of trampled borders.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Rodriguez's sense of self has grown broad enough
to accommodate -- but not to resolve -- his own contradictions. This
is precisely what he wishes for America. But before we can embrace
the many sides of our collective lives, we must cultivate a stronger
faith in life itself.</TE>

<TE>   The Secret History of the FBI</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Kessler</TE>
<TE>   St. Martin's: 488 pp., $27.95</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Kessler opens "The Bureau," his comprehensive history of
the FBI, with Sept. 11 imagery: Barry Mawn, chief of the New York FBI
office, races to the World Trade Center as the twin towers flame. He
sees a female leg on the street severed at the knee, a pink sock and
white sneaker still on. The image haunts Mawn months later. Kessler's
book could not be more timely. Sept. 11 was a monumental
counterintelligence failure, and Kessler wonders if the bureau can be
counted upon to disrupt terrorist cells before they again wreak
havoc. It's a life-and-death issue for the agency that is charged
with averting domestic terrorist attacks, an issue that perforce
looms over every page of this volume. Kessler, a Washington Post
reporter during the Watergate era who gained unprecedented access to
a normally cloistered agency, deftly lays out its checkered history.
The bureau's problem dates from the days of J. Edgar Hoover, when the
FBI's mystique sheltered it from congressional oversight, allowing
for a fit of jurisdictional expansion that took it into fields
unsuited for its gangbuster mentality. The book stands as a
compelling and timely exposition of the real FBI. Kessler should be
the first witness before any congressional body dedicated, in the
interest of public safety, to overhauling the FBI.</TE>

<TE>   W.W. Norton: 288 pp., $25.95</TE>
<TE>   In the spring of 1900, in a small town called Konitz, then part of
Germany, now part of Poland, an 18-year-old youth was murdered and
chopped into pieces. Before long, a story began going around that the
victim had been ritually slaughtered by Konitz's Jews in order to
obtain Christian blood for the making of matzos. When the German
authorities (who knew better) did not pursue this line of
investigation but started questioning a local Christian butcher whose
daughter might have been having an affair with the deceased youth,
there were increasing outbreaks of violence against the town's Jews.
This culminated in a series of anti-Semitic riots so fierce that the
Prussian army had to be called in to restore order and protect the
Jews. "Forty years after the rioters of Konitz shouted, 'Beat the
Jews to death,' " reflects Helmut Walser Smith, "a modern government,
supported by a cast of willing executioners and ordinary men, did
precisely that." But Smithdraws conclusions somewhat different from
those in Daniel Goldhagen's "Hitler's Willing Executioners."</TE>
<TE>   Piecing together evidence culled from newspapers, police and court
records, and other documents, he not only creates a painfully
detailed portrait of a backward, economically depressed small town
but also adopts the role of latter-day detective, reopening an
unsolved case and coming up with a plausible solution. Smith's crisp
writing, his analytical mind and his skill as a storyteller make his
book as absorbing as a mystery novel.</TE>

<TE>   Charles Darwin</TE>
<TE>   The Power of Place</TE>
<TE>   Janet Browne</TE>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf: 594 pp., $37.50</TE>
<TE>   In the concluding second volume of her brilliant, landmark
biography, "Charles Darwin: The Power of Place," English science
historian Janet Browne has chronicled the public birthing of an idea
long incubated in the womb of Darwin's mind. The paradox of Darwin's
personality is the crux of the story. He was both a recluse and the
most influential public intellect of his century; jealous and
generous; an ocean voyager who hated to travel; a scientist prone to
quackery; an unfettered thinker who chained himself to rigid domestic
routine; the privileged son of the well-to-do elite, trained for the
clergy, whose ideas struck at the heart of Anglican doctrine; the
secularist whose life's work sapped the power of the established
church who yet was buried with honor in the nave of Westminster
Abbey. What emerges from Browne's book is the most insightful
portrait in a generation of this puzzling and provocative mind.</TE>
<TE>   What elevates Browne's account of Darwin's life is her insight
into the liberating power of domesticity for a contemplative mind.
She also well understands how, as an invalid, Darwin used his
migraines and digestive disorders to control those around him. She is
on equally intimate terms with Darwin's inner family circle and the
imperial scientific world in which he flourished.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Darwin left behind 14,000 letters, perhaps half of his
lifetime correspondence, and kept meticulous journals that documented
the daily misgivings and eureka moments of his researches. More is
known about the moment-to-moment development of Darwin's theory of
evolution than of any other scientific idea in history. Browne brings
to life this vast archive to show how this radical theory became
conventional wisdom and how, in the process, science supplanted
established religion as the final authority on the origins of life
and the natural order.</TE>

<TE>   Clara Bingham and Laura Leedy Gansler</TE>
<TE>   Doubleday: 390 pp., $27.50</TE>
<TE>   "Class Action" is the tightly written, extensively researched and
well-plotted account of the first sexual harassment class-action
suit, started by Lois Jenson, who walked naively into Minnesota's
Eveleth Mines and one of the ugliest job environments imaginable, an
environment the mining company refused to clean up until it was
forced to take action nearly 25 years later. By then, Jenson had been
joined by a handful of other female miners, making up the class that
sued and eventually settled the case, and in the process, established
crucial legal precedent. But the ordeal also cost her: Jenson's
physical and mental health deteriorated to an alarming degree.</TE>
<TE>   Written by Clara Bingham, a journalist, and Laura Leedy Gansler, a
lawyer versed in dispute resolution, "Class Action" combines potent
narrative tension with copious research and legal information.
Piecing together the ordeal with the pacing of a novel, they engage
the reader from the outset; we are outraged by the behavior of
particular men and incredulous that the mining company could
consistently turn a blind eye, certain that a resolution must be on
the horizon and then unbelieving that something so evident could take
so long to rectify. Finally, reader and miners are beaten down by a
legal system that allows victims to be re-victimized in court. The
writing is never didactic. The human interest element keeps readers
fascinated and turning pages to see how, when -- and sometimes if --
the abuse would end.</TE>

such films as 'American Graffiti,' 'The Conversation,' 'The

Four years ago he recut 'Touch of Evil,' following Orson Welles's

<TE>   Translated from the Spanish by Kristina Cordero</TE>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf: 386 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   There are a few countries in the world that, through some seeming
magic beyond our normal senses, are able to enchant us despite their
utter misery and propensity to violence. For me -- and I suspect many
others who have been there -- Nicaragua is such a place. Dirty,
sweaty, seemingly cursed and wounded in many ways, this little land
is at the same time physically stunning and inhabited by people with
a strength of character, passion and humanity that washes over you
like a wave, engulfs you and, for those unable to resist that
seductive current, carries you away. I have spent some of the saddest
times of my life in the mountains and steaming coasts of Nicaragua
and some of the most beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   Reading Gioconda Belli's affecting memoir, "The Country Under My
Skin," brought all this back and more. In a way that is utterly
Nicaraguan, she recounts a true tale of passion, poetry,
insurrection, death and seeming liberation, followed by an ugly
ending mediated by a personal coda that is both salving and humane.
It is a hell of a story, recounting the fate of her country and her
self, told with tenderness, honesty and humor.</TE>
<TE>   Belli writes that she and others like her "held a fervent belief
in the inherent nobleness of the human species.... [W]e were never
afraid to dream and we had little respect for cynicism.... A cause is
not hopeless just because its objectives aren't reached in one's
lifetime." Many of those she recalls here who believed these things
died for them. Today in another, colder age, few seem ready to hold
or express such sentiments. And maybe the world is not a better place
as a result.</TE>

<TE>   James M. McPherson is America's preeminent Civil War historian.
His new book tells the story of one violent day when the whole
American future was up for grabs. Had that day ended differently, had
the Confederate Army prevailed at the Battle of Antietam, the history
that we know would never have come to be. Another future, one we can
only imagine, would have followed. McPherson describes the fighting
itself in no more than 20 pages, but few who read those pages are
likely to forget them. The most harrowing passages force us to
confront the physical reality of war. Antietam furnished scenes of
such horror that veteran officers were reduced to mute, incontinent
children. About 6,500 American soldiers died at Antietam. An
additional 15,000 were wounded. Sept. 17, 1862, remains the bloodiest
single day in the nation's history. Those killed at Antietam
outnumber the dead of Pearl Harbor and D-day combined. McPherson has
demonstrated that he needs only 150 pages of narrative to describe
the war's most critical turning point and, in so doing, to illuminate
the true meaning of the vast struggle between freedom and slavery.</TE>

<TE>   Donald Keene's biography of Meiji is as much, if not more, about
Meiji's times as about the man himself, and it is here that the
volume's greatest strengths are to be found. Keene provides an
utterly brilliant exposition of Japanese history from about 1850
until Meiji's death in 1912. The broad strokes of this narrative have
long been well known, but it is Keene's day-by-day detail that makes
this the best history in English of the emergence of modern Japan and
that will happily require the rewriting of many a university lecture.
All the key events are here in striking detail. Keene is well known
as the world's foremost authority on Japanese literature, although it
is less well known that his first scholarly monograph was a superb
look at the 18th and 19th century study of Europe by Japanese
scholars who were themselves forbidden from traveling abroad. Keene,
in turn, has done the reverse, dedicating his life to the
introduction of Japan to those who live elsewhere. With his study of
Meiji, Keene has come full circle: He has returned to his first love,
the writing of history, and he has done so brilliantly and with all

<TE>   David Shenk</TE>
<TE>   Doubleday: 290 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   At age 76, Ralph Waldo Emerson, that serene titan of 19th century
American letters, was invited by a friend at the Harvard Divinity
School to lecture at his home. To the gathered admirers, Emerson
delivered an essay on memory he had written some 22 years before. "As
gravity holds matter from flying into space, so memory gives
stability to knowledge," Emerson read aloud. "Memory performs the
impossible for man by the strength of his divine arms; holds together
past and present, beholding both, existing in both, abides in the
flowing, and gives continuity and dignity to human life. It holds us
to our family, to our friends. Hereby home is possible; hereby only a
new fact has value." How poignant then that, as Emerson spoke those
words, his own memory was failing. He could no longer recognize his
own text. In his dotage, he had lost his place in time and was no
longer able to form new memories or to retrieve the old. He was
pinned to the moment, like a place in the essay text that he marked
with his moving finger as he read. Almost certainly, Emerson had
Alzheimer's disease, and it robbed him of the asset he prized most:
an organized mind.</TE>
<TE>   For David Shenk, Emerson's descent into oblivion perfectly
embodies the horror of a disease that destroys memory and
self-awareness. In "The Forgetting," Shenk has drawn together threads
of neurobiology, art history and psychology into a literary portrait
of Alzheimer's disease perfectly balanced between sorrow and wonder,
devastation and awe. "The Forgetting" is a remarkable addition to the
literature of the science of the mind.</TE>

<TE>   Granta Books: 324 pp., $16.95 paper</TE>
<TE>   Imagine if you will the delicious and absurd fantasy of the
Beverly Hillbillies taking over the Vatican and proselytizing
worldwide after striking crude oil. Stranger than fiction but closer
to truth is the case of the House of Saud. Unlike the nouveaux riches
of the television fable, the House of Saud has for many decades used
its wealth to spread the most extreme and fundamentalist
interpretations of Islam, intolerant toward all those who do not
share its narrow sectarian Wahhabi creed. Malise Ruthven, in his book
"A Fury for God: The Islamist Attack on America," suggests that Saudi
Arabia is the leading exporter not only of petroleum products but
also of fundamentalist Islam. He argues that the Saudis are able to
proselytize effectively not just because of their oil wealth but also
because of their role as "Custodians of the Two Sanctuaries" (Mecca
and Medina), which conveys upon them religious legitimacy. Ruthven's
exegesis is a chilling indictment of Saudi Wahhabism and
Saudi-supported fundamentalism worldwide. It is a serious refutation
of the fundamentalist assault against secular values and a brilliant
probing of the psychosocial motivations of its bloody foot soldiers.
It is grim but essential reading.</TE>

<TE>   Pantheon Books: 280 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   "When we contemplate ruins, we contemplate our own future," writes
Christopher Woodward in "In Ruins." "To statesmen, ruins predict the
fall of Empires, and to philosophers the futility of man's
aspirations. To a poet, the decay of a monument represents the
dissolution of the individual ego in the flow of Time; to a painter
or architect, the fragments of a stupendous antiquity call into
question the purpose of their art." The concept of ruins captures in
ironic suspension the struggle between human striving, nature and the
hand of time. Ruins, Woodward persuasively argues, are momentous and
romantic in essence, with scant relation to naturalism, rationalism
or populism. Demystified, denatured and destatured, denuded of time's
eroding verdure and antiseptically preserved by the rescue mission of
men of science for the greater elucidation of the past, for the
benefit and instruction of the greatest number -- they remain relics
of civilization but they cease to be ruins: those ineffable
inspirators of rumination and rapture in Western art. Woodward's
meditations oscillate between bright fragments of insight and
anecdote -- they shimmer in fugitive attitudes, then slide into
freshly provocative patterns, scattered over the tides of time by
this seasoned tourist to history's shoreline. "In Ruins" is a
picturesque hybrid of travelogue, personal memoir, lyric rhapsody,
art history and cultural criticism.</TE>

<TE>   In the Devil's Snare</TE>
<TE>   The Salem Witchcraft Crisis of 1692</TE>
<TE>   Mary Beth Norton</TE>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf: 432 pp., $30</TE>
<TE>   Every history has its touchstone moments, events that seem to
define something essential about the broader narrative and that
writers return to every generation or so, seeking to create a
"history for our time." For Americans, the trials for witchcraft that
took place in Salem, Mass., in 1692 and resulted in 20 people being
executed are one such moment. Mary Beth Norton's "In the Devil's
Snare: The Salem Witchcraft Crisis of 1692" gives us the freshest and
most detailed account of that compelling crisis that we have had in a
decade. The Salem story she tells is not a cautionary tale of
hysterical lynch justice, as a simplistic and ideologically driven
account might be. Instead, she recaptures a world in which the
interactions, conflicts, fears, frictions of whites and Indians and
blacks, of men and women, of young people in their teens and the
adult leaders of New England produced the outcome of the witch
trials. The key to Puritan Salem lies in the history of the Wabanacki
people. America, the mixed and intermixed, is also as much a story of
1692 as it is of 2002. It is this second insight that makes her book
a landmark achievement. It may well herald a new golden age of
American history, in which the many strands of separate history that
academics have eagerly researched can be recombined to give us new
ways to understand the central moments in our past and thus the
nature of our present.</TE>

<TE>   Chronicles From the Vilna Ghetto and the Camps, 1939-1944</TE>
<TE>   Herman Kruk</TE>
<TE>   Edited by Benjamin Harshav</TE>
<TE>   Translated from the Yiddish by Barbara Harshav</TE>
<TE>   Yale University Press: 732 pp., $45</TE>
<TE>   Real treasures, as we all know, lie buried. Herman Kruk's diary is
a case in point. This seminal document of Holocaust literature,
chronicling life in the ghetto of Vilna and in a labor camp in
Estonia, was first published in Yiddish in 1961 and has, until now,
not been published in English. Its belated publication is a powerful
addition to the literature of the Shoah. Vilna, the Yiddish name for
the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, was a thriving center of Jewish
learning and Zionist activity. At the start of World War II, nearly
60,000 Jews lived there. The city had nearly 100 synagogues and six
daily Jewish newspapers as well as the first Yiddish academic
institute, known as YIVO. All of this, however, was dismantled and
destroyed when the Germans invaded the city in 1941, and by the time
Russian troops entered the city in July 1944, only a few thousand of
Vilna's Jews who had been subject to Nazi rule were still alive.
Poet, diarist, librarian Kruk did not survive, but his words did.</TE>

<TE>   The Lunar Men</TE>
<TE>   Five Friends Whose Curiosity Changed the World</TE>
<TE>   Jenny Uglow</TE>
<TE>   Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux: 596 pp., $30</TE>
<TE>   As a celebration of a local milieu as well as a world culture that
emerged both within it and around it, "The Lunar Men: Five Friends
Whose Curiosity Changed the World" is a compelling exploration of the
Enlightenment, an age of ambition and change -- and of crowds. Dozens
of individuals roam the pages of this teeming campus of a book, and
we watch as they meet, talk, ally themselves, argue, collaborate,
drift apart, grow old and die, and at times it is as if we meet them
too, as if Jenny Uglow takes us gently by the arm and walks us
through the streets of Birmingham and Derby to introduce us to her
cast of characters and to let us in on their conversations as they
scheme and laugh and talk their way through the world that they
helped to shape. Uglow is at her best, both as a historian and a
biographer, in tracing the complex networks of ideas and alliances
that conspired to put inventions and, more specifically, patents into
one pair of hands and not another. Friendship and rivalry stalk these
pages like the figures of virtues from a tapestry, while questions of
priority -- who was the first to discover or invent, whose name will
go on to be remembered or forgotten? -- fueled the anxieties over
money and reputation that smoldered away in the backgrounds of these
lives. Admirers of Uglow's previous book, "Hogarth," will be familiar
with her skill in illuminating ideas and artifacts from the past --
in this case, 18th century science and technology -- by picturing
them in their cultural, social and personal contexts. This approach,
evident on every page and in the work of a generation of like-minded
historians, is particularly well-suited to the history of an activity
as social as science.</TE>

<TE>   My Bengali Girlhood, A Memoir of Growing Up Female</TE>

<TE>   Taslima Nasrin</TE>
<TE>   Translated from the Bengali by Gopa Majumdar</TE>
<TE>   Steerforth Press: 308 pp., $26</TE>
<TE>   Less than a decade ago, Muslim clerics in Bangladesh issued a
series of fatwas against a 31-year-old woman who had written a novel
they found offensive. The woman, Taslima Nasrin, was a physician from
a small town in the northern part of the country. "Meyebela" is the
story of a young girl born into a middle-class Muslim family in what
in 1962 was still East Pakistan. Nasrin grows up watching her mother,
aunts and female neighbors being beaten and humiliated by their men.
She lives in a permanent state of terror at her father's
ever-increasing violence. She is so alienated by him that she forgets
how to speak in his presence. She understands quickly that her mother
has no refuge or escape: The laws of the country, based on Islamic
principles, recognize no rights for women, and their upbringing --
little or no education, no job training and very limited contact with
the world outside the house -- has virtually ensured that they will
starve to death without help from a man. If the Koran contains such
principles, 14-year-old Nasrin concludes, then it isn't a single man
or mullah one can blame for the injustice committed against women; it
is Islam itself, the rule of blind faith at the expense of reason, of
religion instead of logic. "Meyebela" ends at the threshold of this
realization. It will be many years until the quiet young girl will
find the voice and the heart to commit blasphemy and earn a fatwa or
two. Her courage is all the more stunning to those who have lived
under the reign of silence that pervades the Muslim world, who have
seen how not only men but also very often women join in the effort to
perpetuate fear and violence against other females, how a dissenting
voice, a rebel mind, is quickly reformed or purged.</TE>

<TE>   History and Meaning in the Time of the Pharaohs</TE>
<TE>   Jan Assmann</TE>
<TE>   Metropolitan Books: 514 pp., $35</TE>
<TE>   Ancient Egypt exercises a powerful fascination. We live in close
familiarity with the ancient Egyptians, with the best-known pharaohs,
Cheops, Akhenaten and Ramesses II. Theirs is the face of ancient
Egypt, which is turned toward us, recovered from inscription and
papyrus and with the archeologist's spade. But there is a hidden
face, too, that of the infinitesimal changes, unnoticed by those who
experience them and visible only to the analytical gaze of the
historian. In his magnificent "The Mind of Egypt," Jan Assmann likens
humans to spiders, who act within the invisible webs they have woven:
webs of interaction among themselves and worlds of meaning whose
horizons define action, experience and remembrance. He asks what
meaning Egyptians obtained from their own constructions of their
history. How did they incorporate the legacy of the past into the
present? Assmann examines patterns of continuity and disruption; he
writes: "The old remained present; it never became alien in the sense
of representing something left definitively behind." Assmann has
looked closely into the mirror of the ancient intangible with telling
effect. Every student of early civilization has something to learn
from these pages, which will help cure us of intellectual myopia.</TE>

<TE>   and Its Unfulfilled Duty of Repair</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Jonah Goldhagen</TE>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf: 346 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   When Daniel Goldhagen's first book, "Hitler's Willing
Executioners," was published in 1996, it ignited controversy for
arguing that ordinary Germans, not just the SS and Nazi party
members, chose to implement the Final Solution. Goldhagen was widely
criticized for views that seemed oversimplified, empirically
questionable and arrogantly argued, but as time passed -- and
especially owing to the book's favorable reception in Germany -- his
work withstood much of the criticism. Such a reaction undoubtedly
awaits "A Moral Reckoning," a book that vigorously challenges the
Roman Catholic Church to take responsibility for its role in the
Holocaust. He calls for a radical reformation to remove from
Christianity the anti-Semitism that implicated it in the Holocaust
and still leaves the Christian tradition immorally mired in deception
and hypocrisy. He has written a post-Holocaust moral reckoning with
Christianity, and the Roman Catholic Church in particular, that pulls
few punches and guarantees a hard-hitting bout over history, ethics
and theology.</TE>

<TE>   Wislawa Szymborska</TE>
<TE>   Translated from the Polish by Clare Cavanagh</TE>
<TE>   Harcourt: 236 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   For the last 3 1/2 decades, Wislawa Szymborska, the Polish poet
awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1996, has been writing a
newspaper column called "Nonrequired Reading." Occasioned by a motley
array of books that have come her way -- everything and anything from
an encyclopedia of assassination to a do-it-yourself guide to
wallpapering -- these short pieces (around 500 words each) are not
book reviews, she declares, but "sketches." Some, as it happens,
contain astute criticism of the books in question, but in the main,
Szymborska simply uses the books as jumping-off points. Informal,
unpretentious, full of common sense, shrewd insight and wry humor
(all ably captured in Clare Cavanagh's fine translation),
Szymborska's sketches have a matter-of-fact ease and simplicity that
will win the hearts of readers and the envy of other writers who know
how hard it can be to achieve such grace. As one reads this
chronologically arranged selection, which begins in 1968, one is
struck by the unwavering humanity and compassion of this woman's
voice. Whether she is considering books on birds, Neanderthals,
fossils, tyrants or extraterrestrial life, Szymborska's great gift is
her ability to see straight through to the essentials.</TE>

<TE>   Francis Fukuyama</TE>
<TE>   Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux: 272 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   Francis Fukuyama is convinced that only a powerful new government
agency can safely channel what he considers an assault on the
biological foundations of human nature. "We appear to be poised at
the cusp of one of the most momentous periods of technological
advance in history," Fukuyama writes. "These developments will be
hugely controversial because they will challenge dearly held notions
of human equality and the capacity for moral choice; they will give
societies new techniques for controlling the behavior of their
citizens; they will change our understanding of human personality and
identity; they will upend existing social hierarchies and affect the
rate of intellectual, material and political progress; and they will
affect the nature of global politics." For those who would look
before they leap, Fukuyama has written an invaluable prescription for
government regulation. Rarely has someone entering the policy arena
so eloquently and precisely laid out the case for political control
of emerging technology.</TE>

the interventionist right converged to embrace Wilsonian ends and
means before Sept. 11, even as U.S. administrations remained wary of

<TE>   and Suppression in</TE>
<TE>   Nineteenth-Century America</TE>
<TE>   Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz</TE>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf: 528 pp., $30</TE>
<TE>   Reading about sex, seeing it in movies, talking about it on
television and other public milieus have become commonplace. Even the
once-verboten topics of prostitution, sexually transmitted diseases,
rape, incest and child abuse have become objects of talk-show
chatter. But mention a harmless activity practiced by most girls and
women and almost every man and boy, and you just might suffer the
fate of former U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, fired from her
job by a president who might himself have benefited from her sage
advice. Indeed, apart from the yeoman service performed on its behalf
by "Portnoy's Complaint," masturbation has been the proverbial orphan
child. It has been condemned as wicked and sinful by the anti-sex
crowd but with none of the risque glamour associated with
fornication, adultery or homosexuality. Strangely, too, it has fared
almost as badly among the pro-sex crowd who are inclined to view it
as the sorry fate of sexual wallflowers. Understanding why a country,
so awash in pornography and so tolerant of sexual freedom, could
react so hysterically to Elders' mild comment was one of the motives
animating Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz's research into sexual attitudes
in 19th century America. "Rereading Sex" is a splendid work of
scholarship: crisply written, meticulously documented, full of fresh
material, shrewd analysis and sound judgment. But one need not be a
historian to enjoy this book. Horowitz's enthusiasm and sense of fun
are infectious. A superb storyteller, she is a great elucidator,
always on hand to explain knotty matters such as the history of
obscenity law, the motives of censors or the thinking of reform
physiologists. Her book is an unmitigated pleasure to read yet is so
informative that those who read it will feel not only good but
downright virtuous.</TE>

<TE>   Rosalind Franklin</TE>
<TE>   The Dark Lady of DNA</TE>
<TE>   Brenda Maddox</TE>
<TE>   HarperCollins: 400 pp., $29.95</TE>
<TE>   Philosopher of science Evelyn Fox Keller once remarked that if a
woman scientist hopes to win a Nobel Prize, she had better plan on
living a very long time. Rosalind Franklin, unwisely, died at 37,
putting her out of the running when, four years later, her colleague
Maurice Wilkins, along with James Watson and Francis Crick, was
awarded a Nobel for discovering the structure of DNA. Franklin's
impeccable X-ray photographs provided the data on which Watson and
Crick built their ideas, and Franklin herself was already on track to
deciphering DNA. Few experts today doubt that her name also should be
on the Nobel roster. Without Franklin's data, as Watson himself has
admitted, they would not have been able to get there. But a question
lingers: Why didn't Franklin take the theoretical initiative? Why
didn't she discern the double helix model herself? Brenda Maddox's
poignant and pithy biography might be seen as an attempt to get to
the heart of this conundrum, and here she does justice to her subject
as only the best biographers can. Maddox's book, though ostensibly a
biography of an individual, is an exploration of the changing nature
of science itself and, above all, of what is required for success in
the field. At the peak of her career, having already made significant
contributions to three separate fields of science, Franklin died of
ovarian cancer, very likely induced by overexposure to X-rays in the
course of her research. The true tragedy here, as Maddox notes in her
final pages, is not the absence of a Nobel but the premature
termination of a brilliant career: "The lost prize was life."</TE>

<TE>   Secrets</TE>
<TE>   A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Ellsberg</TE>
<TE>   Viking: 498 pp., $29.95</TE>
<TE>   The publication of Daniel Ellsberg's memoir, "Secrets," at this
particular moment is undoubtedly coincidental, but there is an eerie
timeliness about it. Rumors of war abound, this time perhaps for a
unilateral preemptive full-scale attack unprecedented in American
history. Decisions are being made on the basis of secret information
that will be divulged, in Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld's
words, "only if and when the president decides that he thinks it's
appropriate." It is this arrogance and secretiveness that are at the
heart of the events in Ellsberg's book and that, he believes, pose a
grave threat to the democratic process.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't it after all only history? Does it really matter?" With
these dismissive words, Ellsberg recalls, Sen. J. William Fulbright
(D-Ark.) in 1970 refused to make public the Pentagon Papers, the
top-secret internal history of America's early involvement in Vietnam
commissioned by Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara in 1967. It
was only history, perhaps, but it was this history that finally
persuaded an already deeply skeptical Ellsberg that the war in
Vietnam had no basis in legitimacy and that led him to do something
he believed would land him in jail. He purloined the report from the
Rand Corp. in Santa Monica, where he worked, and released it to the
New York Times, an action that caused a furor in the country and in
the White House and set into motion events that led to Watergate, the
fall of Richard Nixon's presidency and the end of the Vietnam War.</TE>
<TE>   "Secrets" is an often gripping account by a controversial figure
of a tumultuous era that still troubles and divides us. It
underscores the need to understand history in areas of the world
whose destinies we presume to shape. It provides important insights
into the national security bureaucracy that produced the Vietnam War,
the system that helped sustain it and the ethos and code of loyalty
among officials that held it together. If we're looking for a warning
signal as we teeter on the brink of yet another war waged on the
basis of information considered too important to share with the
public, we should look no further than in these pages.</TE>

<TE>   We live in a time of fuzzy thinking: Attitude substitutes for
politics, newness is conflated with modernity, precision itself is

reestablishes crucial distinctions: between skepticism and cynicism,
flexibility and moral relativism, conviction and rigidity, humility
and despair. He is very angry about the ways in which we defile one
another and the world: He is one of those rare people who hears the
screams. But he hears the music too. Tenderness, and an unflagging
interest in the experience of being human, infuse his work. He once
described Goya as honest "in the full sense of the word meaning
facing the facts and preserving one's ideals." What is true for the

<TE>   Houghton Mifflin: 274 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   Some books are necessary, some are wonderful, few are both. In
that select group belongs Joseph Epstein's "Snobbery: The American
Version." I would rank it with works by Alexis de Tocqueville and
Thorstein Veblen, except that it is more timely than the former's and
infinitely more amusing than the latter's. It is one of the rare
books that entertain as much as they teach. With "Snobbery," Epstein
undertakes a book-length essay in a series of chapters that each
address a different type of snobbery. The amazingly alert and
perceptive author pursues snobbishness from its spotlighted stages to
its hidden breeding grounds and discovers striking varieties in
crannies the rest of us would have overlooked. "Snobbery: The
American Version" cannot, any more than anything else can, put a stop
to snobbery, but it may, by making us conscious of its
ridiculousness, help us control its worst excesses. Ironically,
though, it may create a new, albeit minor, form of snobbery: pride in
how many times you are mentioned, however unfavorably (Bill Buckley
and Donald Trump twice), in this most treasurable of books.</TE>

<TE>   What the father-and-son team of John and Alan Lomax -- white guys
-- did for American music in the 1930s when the two went around the
backwoods of the South recording black musicians and authentic blues,
another father-and-son team of white guys, William and Paul Arnett,
has done for contemporary American art, identifying and collecting
since the 1970s vernacular art made by black artists in the South.
Vernacular art is sometimes called folk or outsider art, because it
is the work of people who have no formal training and, until 20 years
or so ago, was not usually a part of gallery or museum culture. It
was art made and exhibited in backyards, alleys, sheds and in modest
homes, sometimes the houses themselves being objects of decoration.
Its styles suggest that Zora Neale Hurston was not entirely wrong
when she claimed that "the will to adorn" was an important feature of
the visual culture of many black people in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   After an odyssey of discovery spanning three decades, the Arnetts
have produced two enormous volumes (with nearly 1,800 full-color
reproductions) about this indigenous art, with a promise of more. In
his introduction, Paul Arnett allows that "Souls Grown Deep" is "the
first comprehensive overview of the recent history" of vernacular
art.</TE>
<TE>   "Souls Grown Deep" serves to remind the anxious, hyped glut of the
current cultural scene that art has no real reward outside of itself.</TE>

<TE>   American Foreign Policy and How It Changed the World</TE>
<TE>   Walter Russell Mead</TE>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf: 378 pp., $30</TE>
<TE>   The title of Walter Russell Mead's long-awaited reinterpretation
of the entire course of American foreign policy since the founding of
the Republic is derived from the sarcastic observation usually
attributed to Otto von Bismarck: "God has a special providence for
fools, drunks, and the United States of America." It is not that Mead
agrees with the 19th century German chancellor. To the contrary,
"Special Providence" derives much of its intellectual force and
originality from Mead's indignation over the fact that not only have
foreign observers -- from Bismarck to Charles de Gaulle -- wrongly
concluded that the United States has never had a foreign policy
worthy of the name but that, even more important, many if not most
Americans have joined in what he calls this "wholesale dismissal of
the country's foreign policy traditions." Mead is keen to set the
record straight. His book is an impassioned effort to debunk the view
of such American Bismarckians as Henry Kissinger, who once wrote that
"America's journey through international relations has been a triumph
of faith over experience." Mead is equally dismissive of the
assumptions of an American liberal establishment that has tended to
reduce the country's foreign policy debate to a straightforward
quarrel pitting idealists like themselves, isolationists and realists
like Kissinger against one another. For Mead, the reality has been
both more complex and more interesting. Mead is a brilliant scholar,
and he has produced a book of enduring value as both a work of
intellectual genealogy and a stimulating reevaluation of some of the
roots of America's rise.</TE>

<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf: 594 pp., $35</TE>
<TE>   Sam Fuller's gloriously robust memoir is the inspirational book of
the year, if not decade, for anyone even remotely connected to the

learned as a 16-year-old crime reporter covering suicides and
executions for the New York Graphic, a lurid sex-and-scandal sheet,
seizes you by the scruff and flings you headlong into his harsh,
funny, violent universe of independent filmmaking on the far edge of
a bygone Hollywood where deals were consummated by a handshake, not a
studio lawyer's 1,000-page small-print contract. This posthumously
published autobiography -- Fuller died five years ago and it took
nearly that long for the manuscript and the tapes he left behind to
be edited and transcribed -- is not a how-to, yet somehow you learn
more from it about how to make good movies than in almost all the
technical cinema texts I have read. Sam Fuller -- his father's birth
name was Rabinovitch -- is a good teacher because he had guts,
passion, anarchic emotions under the strict control of tough
deadlines and a true lover's addiction to film. Holy cow! -- to use

<TE>   There's hardly a false or self-pitying or retributive note in his
book. The man was in love with life, with movies and with telling the
gutter truth as he saw it. Fuller died in 1997, shortly after
dictating this memoir with the help of his wife, Christa Lang, and
Jerome Henry Rudes, founder of the Avignon Film Festival. His last
words are, again, for young film lovers. "Okay, all you new voices,
let yourself be heard!"</TE>

<TE>   Tonight At Noon</TE>
<TE>   A Love Story</TE>
<TE>   Sue Graham Mingus</TE>
<TE>   Pantheon: 288 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   I remember seeing Charlie Mingus one night at Birdland during the
1960s. He stood with his bass to the left on a bandstand that
included reeds, horns and a rhythm section, and though his players
had scores, Mingus would spontaneously call on soloists or indicate
whole sections for particular emphasis or unrehearsed interludes. It
was as if he was playing his bass and his orchestra simultaneously.
His body of work is among the most emotionally protean with one of
the most varied and informed musical pedigrees in American history.
His compositions embrace gospel, blues, R&amp;B, salsa and Afro-Cuban
strains -- often in boldly articulated "movements." Works such as
"Fables of Faubus," "Self Portrait in Three Colors," "Reincarnation
of a Lovebird" and "Sue's Changes" are American classics. To listen
to the music of Charles Mingus is to hear darkness and light, pain
and jubilation, beauty and beast in an enchanted musical continuum.
Sue Mingus survives and perpetuates her husband with a loving,
exacting portrait: "Tonight at Noon," titled after one of her
husband's compositions, has the emotional fluency and power of
Mingus' own music.</TE>

<TE>   Trains of Thought</TE>
<TE>   Memories of a Stateless Youth</TE>
<TE>   Victor Brombert</TE>
<TE>   W.W. Norton: 336 pp., $25.95</TE>
<TE>   "At the beginning was the train," is how Victor Brombert opens his
striking memoir, "Trains of Thought: Memories of a Stateless Youth."
Proust, too, saw the idea of travel as a way to unlock memory, as a
voyage in reverse, going over the routes that have been covered
before. Like Proust, Brombert takes imaginary journeys. He watches a
train leave a station and reads the signs that spell out its
destinations. He tells us that, even now, as he is trying to sleep,
he hears a sinister locomotive whistle. This is a beautifully written
book. It has an elegance and is never a mere recording of what
happened in France between 1933 and 1941.</TE>

<TE>   The Trials of Lenny Bruce</TE>
<TE>   The Fall and Rise of an American Icon</TE>
<TE>   Ronald K.L. Collins &amp; David M. Skover</TE>
<TE>   Sourcebooks Inc.: 546 pp., $29.95</TE>
<TE>   "The Trials of Lenny Bruce," written by a pair of diligent
attorneys, Ronald K.L. Collins and David M. Skover, is the first
fully recorded history of Bruce's relationship with the 1st
Amendment. "The date of Lenny Bruce's death," in 1966, the authors of
"The Trials of Lenny Bruce" conclude, "is as good a marker as any of
the moment when words alone -- any performance words spoken in comedy
clubs -- ceased to be targets of prosecution." The book comes with a
CD containing relevant excerpts from interviews and Bruce's
performances, ranging from his poetic descriptions (a judge with
"thick fingers and the homemade glass eye") to his bit about
prosecutors using in court the same words that Bruce got arrested
for: "[Bruce] said 'blah-blah-blah' -- then I dug something -- they
liked saying 'blah-blah-blah.'" "The Trials of Lenny Bruce" serves as
the missing link between two of Bruce's statements: "In the Halls of
Justice, the only justice is in the halls." And, "I love the law."</TE>

<TE>   The Truth About Babies</TE>
<TE>   Ian Sansom</TE>
<TE>   Granta Books: 338 pp., $19.95</TE>
<TE>   "The Truth About Babies" does not, fortunately, deliver what its
title threatens: a polemical tell-all or, worse, a cute self-help
book for new parents. Ian Sansom, who lives in Northern Ireland, is
the father of three young children, and he presents himself, in the
best sense of the word, as an amateur, trying to grasp the phantom of
babyhood and parenthood. For those who have waded through shelves of
works by psychologists and pediatricians and would like a profoundly
funny and wise book on the subject, "The Truth About Babies" is one
of the most interesting and literate meditations available. "There
are only two kinds of useful books about babies," Sansom declares,
"textbooks and [books of] poems." Sansom's meditations are really
poems, often addressed to his newest baby, in which witty and
thoughtfully focused observations become wonderful feats of
association. Sansom often reflects on the suitability of the book's
somewhat unpredictable drift to its subject: "With babies, there's no
time for fooling around with narratives, with niceties like
beginnings and middles and end. You have no plot. You're pure story.
You defy the stylistic conventions." He speaks here to his audience
as well as to and about himself and his baby.</TE>

<TE>   War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning</TE>
<TE>   Chris Hedges</TE>
<TE>   PublicAffairs: 212 pp., $23</TE>
<TE>   Chris Hedges never flinches when describing the complex reality of
contemporary armed conflicts. As a veteran war reporter from the
killing fields of El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Colombia, the
West Bank, Gaza, the Sudan, Yemen, Algeria, the Punjab, Romania, the
Persian Gulf, Turkey, northern Iraq, Bosnia and Kosovo, Hedges
bellows out a reminder that war is ugly and morally perverse yet also
profoundly alluring. Combat is a drug that is polluting and
addictive. War fulfills many of humanity's fantasies, giving meaning
to our lives by drawing attention to the trivia of placid
domesticity.</TE>
<TE>   War's dark charm must be resisted, however. Without exception, war
brutalizes. Few war journalists are as sensitive as Hedges to the
humiliation that pervades war culture. During the Persian Gulf War,
Hedges observed the monstrous ease with which American explosives
transformed battalions of young Iraqis into dismembered carcasses. He
writes with passion about the "cold and brutal efficiency of
industrial warfare."</TE>
<TE>   War's addiction, the "Oz-like world" of repression and deception
and the mythical dreamland of the military crusade, are to be feared.
Our responses to terrorist attacks must not be allowed to distort
democracy. This book is an example of the best kind of war
journalism: It is bitterly poetic and ruthlessly philosophical. It
sends out a powerful message to people contemplating the escalation
of the "war against terrorism."</TE>

<TE>   Wealth and Democracy</TE>
<TE>   A Political History of the American Rich</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Phillips</TE>
<TE>   Broadway Books: 474 pp., $29.95</TE>
<TE>   It is a truth universally acknowledged that as individuals become
more successful, more established and older, they generally become
more attached to a socio-economic order that rewards success. It is
unusual and extraordinary, therefore, for an individual, while living
comfortably, to grow increasingly critical of the existing order.
Such is the case with Kevin Phillips, who has been one of the most
distinguished and thought-provoking commentators on the American
political scene for more than 30 years. Phillips' new book is
subtitled "A Political History of the American Rich," and so it
ranges back to the late 18th century, chronicling the growth of the
great family fortunes, like those of the Vanderbilts, the Astors, the
Rockefellers and the Morgans through the hurly-burly of gaining and
spending wealth in the last century. The reading is wide but not
exhaustive, and the narrative is complex because it is more thematic
than chronological. There are lively chapters on political influence,
corruption and speculative bubbles, others on the role of technology
and the sources of wealth. But this is no mere social history of the
wealthy in America. It comes with a punch. It is a call to action.
The political analyst of of the late 20th century has become the
soothsayer, social critic and economic reformer of the early 21st
century. Predictions nearly a half century ago about the spreading
grip of the Republican Party have been replaced by stern warnings
that this very party is treading on dangerous waters and harming the
American democracy. "Wealth and Democracy" is a brave book.</TE>

<TE>   The Writer and the World</TE>
<TE>   Essays</TE>
<TE>   V.S. Naipaul</TE>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf: 526 pp., $30</TE>
<TE>   If ever there was a writer who made a supreme virtue out of an
enduring necessity, surely that writer is V.S. Naipaul. The virtue is
the bright, burning development of an unusually strong intelligence;
the necessity is a temperament that nurses humiliation as one would
nurse a seeping wound. The result: 50 years of literary
interpretation of this, our one and only world, almost exclusively in
terms of its crippling meanness. Naipaul is often coupled with
writers such as Joseph Conrad and E.M. Forster because they, too,
wrote of colonial Africa and India, but his true counterpart is
Jonathan Swift, whose brilliant prose was also put to work to
demonstrate human existence as the sum of its disabilities. The
collection of essays we now have in hand is made up of travel pieces
written over the decades: more than 500 unremitting pages of Naipaul
casting his famously cold eye on a huge cut of the world. Actually,
the coldness is overrated; there is warmth beneath it: the dangerous
warmth of emotional identification. We are in the presence of a
writer aroused by the sight of people who look just like himself
struggling to make themselves human -- and failing, failing, failing.
From this perspective his intelligence cannot be diverted. And
because his intelligence is his genius, to watch Naipaul think about
what he is looking at (no matter what the vantage point) is to learn
how exceptional writing is done. The rage is the drive, the mind is
the talent, but the sentences he taught himself to write, they are
the magic.</TE>

<TE>   Writing Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   A Literary Anthology</TE>
<TE>   Edited by David L. Ulin</TE>
<TE>   Library of America: 884 pp., $40</TE>
<TE>   "Writing Los Angeles" is a nearly 900-page anthology that, like
the city it seeks to represent, is both multifaceted and immense. It
offers a panoramic view of a diverse and sprawling literary
landscape, featuring brief chronological selections from the work of
nearly 80 writers who have sought over the last century or so to make
sense of the astonishingly swift rise of the improbable megalopolis
Mike Davis memorably called the "city of quartz," bright, hard,
opaque. David L. Ulin has done a masterful job of choosing some of
the more compelling efforts to evoke a city whose essence has proved
maddeningly elusive for most of the writers who found themselves
here. Los Angeles, on the evidence provided by the authors in
"Writing Los Angeles," is a city that has yet to make up its mind
about what it wants to be when it grows up. The one thing it knows
for certain is that it wants to get there fast. What emerges in
"Writing Los Angeles" is a magical city of the imagination that is as
complex, dynamic and familiar as the real city of palm trees with
"scrawny fronds like broken pinwheels," in the words of Robert Towne,
who, like others, remembers growing up with "the Santa Anas
progressively drying the city into sand and summer smells" and the
"smell of pepper trees mentholated more and more by eucalyptus."
"Writing Los Angeles" is an indispensable introduction to the
literature of Los Angeles. It by no means exhausts the subject.</TE>

<LD>It is a pleasure to recommend to readers a clutch of books published
in the last year that we found exemplary. Any such list is
subjective, even idiosyncratic, of course, since it is impossible to
read every worthy book that beckons. We are nonetheless promiscuous
readers whose greatest delight is to happen upon a story or subject
we had no idea we were interested in but which, in the hands of a
gifted and graceful author, proves compelling and unforgettable. Or,
alternatively, to have an author complicate a subject we thought we
already knew, challenging us to think harder and more deeply. Here,
in alphabetical order by author, are 10 works of fiction and 10 of
nonfiction that are among the many works that afforded the greatest
pleasure and helped us see the world with fresh eyes.</LD>

<LD>Beat Poets</LD>
<LD>   Edited by Carmela Ciuraru</LD>
<LD>   Alfred A. Knopf: 236 pp., $12.50</LD>
<TE>   "Kerouac opened a million coffee bars," quipped Beat novelist
William S. Burroughs about the so-called King of the Beat Generation,
"and sold a million pairs of Levi's to both sexes." But the fact is
that far more people talk about the Beats than read their work, which
is exactly why Carmela Ciuraru's "Beat Poets," a title in the
Everyman's Pocket Poets series, is such an essential volume. Here are
excerpts from all of the famous Beats and a great many who are
unknown but worthy, ranging from Ray Bremser's "City Madness" to John
Wieners' "A Poem for the Insane." As a kind of counterweight to the
poetry itself, Ciuraru closes out the collection with excerpts from
the letters and other writings of Kerouac, Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg
and Lawrence Ferlinghetti.</TE>

<TE>   The Free Speech Movement</TE>
<TE>   Reflections on Berkeley in the 1960s</TE>
<TE>   Edited by Robert Cohen and Reginald E. Zelnik</TE>
<TE>   University of California Press: 620 pp., $55; $19.95 paper</TE>
<TE>   To understand what it was like to come of age in the '60s, to
understand how America changed in profound and revolutionary ways, we
need to be reminded of what was really at stake when the banner of
the Free Speech Movement was raised in Sproul Plaza at the Berkeley
campus of the University of California. The editors of "The Free
Speech Movement" have assembled a kind of colloquium-in-print that
allows us to hear the voices of the men and women who figured
prominently in the movement as well as the scholars who have
reflected on its effect on history. The result is an impressive work
of scholarship enlivened by moments of bittersweet memoir that will
resonate powerfully for readers of a certain age.</TE>

<TE>   Golden State, Golden Youth</TE>
<TE>   The California Image in Popular Culture, 1955-1966</TE>
<TE>   Kirse Granat May</TE>
<TE>   University of North Carolina Press: 256 pp., $18.95 paper</TE>
<TE>   Historian Kirse Granat May digs through the accumulation of
cliches and conventional wisdom about California youth culture and
reveals how the whole phenomenon can be seen as the handiwork of
media and marketing entrepreneurs, driven by profit motive and
something much deeper and darker -- the fear of class, race and
generational conflict. Wholly fascinating in its savvy take on the
making and manipulation of pop culture, Kirse's study is a lively
exercise in the deconstruction of beach movies, coonskin caps, surf
music and even Annette Funicello's famous one-piece swimsuit.</TE>

<TE>   The High Sierra of California</TE>
<TE>   Gary Snyder and Tom Killion</TE>
<TE>   Heyday Books/Yosemite Assn.: 128 pp., $50</TE>
<TE>   Beat poetry may seem to boil up out of the mean streets of
America, but there is also a pastoral tradition among the Beats, and
it is richly evoked and honored in "The High Sierra of California" by
Gary Snyder and Tom Killion, a highly elegant mating of Snyder's
poems and trail-notes, excerpts from the writings of naturalist John
Muir and the superb and often stunning woodcuts of printer and
printmaker Killion. The hand-carved wood and linoleum block prints --
sometimes stately and solemn, sometimes mysterious and mystical,
sometimes rollicking and even slightly ribald -- are the visual
equivalent of Snyder's poetry and the real glory of the book.</TE>

<TE>   Life and Art at the Woman's Building</TE>
<TE>   Terry Wolverton</TE>
<TE>   City Lights Books: 244 pp., $17.95 paper</TE>
<TE>   The now-defunct Woman's Building in downtown Los Angeles was
ground zero in the feminist art movement for some 16 years. As seen
through the eyes of Terry Wolverton -- artist, poet, novelist,
teacher and one of the enduring literary lights of Los Angeles -- the
Woman's Building was "a collision of history and politics and art," a
place where women were beginning to make new demands on themselves
and the world around them. For Wolverton herself, the Woman's
Building encouraged an intimate journey toward self-discovery and
self-definition as a lesbian and an artist. "When people wonder at
the meaning the Woman's Building continues to have for me, they must
consider that my story there began with resurrection, and I came to
it mucky and tender and quivering as any newborn."</TE>

<TE>   The John Fante Reader</TE>
<TE>   Edited by Stephen Cooper</TE>
<TE>   William Morrow: 366 pp., $25.95</TE>
<TE>   John Fante is one of those tragic figures of arts and letters
whose best work was cruelly overlooked in his own lifetime, only to
be "discovered" and celebrated long after his death. His novels and
short stories, the best of which are excerpted here, are now compared
favorably with Henry Miller and Ernest Hemingway. Set mostly in
Southern California, and spanning a period from the Depression to the
early 1980s, the writing collected in "The John Fante Reader" allows
us to see the world through the eyes of a man who was wholly free of
sentiment and self-deception and yet who was fascinated by his own
origins and afire with his own passions.</TE>

<TE>   The Memory Room</TE>
<TE>   A Novel</TE>
<TE>   Mary Rakow</TE>
<TE>   Counterpoint: 512 pp., $26</TE>
<TE>   To describe "The Memory Room" as a novel of a woman in midlife
crisis fails to capture the lofty ambition and high achievement
embodied in Mary Rakow's first novel. At the dark heart of "The
Memory Room" are the woman's memories of the outrage that she
suffered as a young child. The weapons she uses to keep her demons at
bay are art, horticulture, music, psychology, the Bible and, above
all, poetry. A compelling storyteller, Rakow takes a certain moral
risk in equating the private horror of sexual abuse with the vast
grotesqueries of the Holocaust: "All cruelty is the same," says
Barbara, the principal character. But what distinguishes Rakow's
novel from less accomplished work is the sheer abundance of literary
ornamentation and invention. "All art is this," she writes. "All art
is memory."</TE>

<TE>   Luis J. Rodriguez</TE>
<TE>   Rayo/HarperCollins: 240 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   Luis J. Rodriguez is best known for his memoir of gang life,
"Always Running: La Vida Loca, Gang Days in L.A.," but his new
collection of short fiction represents yet another experiment in
devising a language that will enable him to describe the experience
of the barrio to his readers. He delights in exploring the
cross-wired cultures that sizzle and pop on the street of East Los
Angeles by showing us figures of valor and courage and moments of
grace and redemption.</TE>

<TE>   Route 66</TE>
<TE>   The Romance of the West</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Arthur Repp</TE>
<TE>   Mock Turtle Press: 214 pp., $34.95</TE>
<TE>   Here and there along Route 66, the most famous highway in America,
a few visionaries saw a way to separate the travelers from their
dimes and dollars, and their sideshow antics are celebrated in Thomas
Arthur Repp's scrapbook of Route 66 memorabilia, "Route 66: The
Romance of the West." Colorful and kinetic in its presentation, full
of arresting images and packed with tales told with a wink and a nod
by various old coots and charming rogues, "Route 66" is clearly
intended to satisfy an appetite for nostalgia, but it can be
approached as a serious study of American pop culture disguised as a
coffee-table book.</TE>

<TE>   Ruth Harriet Louise and</TE>

<TE>   Photography</TE>
<TE>   Robert Dance and Bruce Robertson</TE>
<TE>   University of California Press/Santa Barbara</TE>
<TE>   Museum of Art: 286 pp., $65; $35 paper</TE>
<TE>   When she joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1925 at the age of 22, Ruth
Harriet Louise was the only woman in Hollywood working as a chief
studio photographer. Often surprising and always fascinating, "Ruth
Harriet Louise and Hollywood Glamour Photography" is a biography of
Louise, a history of portrait photography in the early years of the
Hollywood studio system and a showcase for some of her most
accomplished and memorable images. Drawing from the 100,000 negatives
that she created during her short career, the authors point out that
Louise's work amounts to the purest expression of the culture she
helped to create: "the definitive image of Hollywood beauty and
glamour."</TE>

<BD>Carol Muske-Dukes is a contributing writer to Book
Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's hard to imagine applying the "best of" or Oscar mentality to
poetry, the one art that has (more or less) managed to escape
commodification and Hollywoodization. Still, every year brings an
abundance of poetry books that deserve acknowledgment and praise --
yet few are recognized in journals, fewer still in the pages of our
newspaper book sections.</LD>
<LD>   The most illuminating aspect of the recent $100-million endowment
given to Poetry magazine was not the size of the gift but rather the
subsequent revelation (reported in The Times, "Regarding Media," Nov.
23) that Poetry gets roughly 90,000 submissions yearly from all over
the world and its monthly circulation peaks at just 10,000. Its
subscription base is tiny. Literary magazines and hosts of literary
contests have struggled with this awkward truth for some time: There
are a whole lot of would-be poets out there who are writing but not
reading. So here's a toast to the rigors and blessings of reading
poetry, to reading itself -- to understanding that before we can
learn to write, we must learn to read with passion and profound
attention.</LD>
<TE>   Poetry had a very good year in 2002: Many superb collections were
published. A few of these books were reviewed in this column. There
are many others worthy of consideration and praise that never made it
into this column -- and then there are books (poems and essays on
poems) that have been simply neglected overall. We seem to have a
diminished taste for truly challenging poetry, poetry that demands
something of us as readers -- and a nearly nonexistent capacity to
appreciate serious literary essays not of the "how to write a
bestseller" variety. Below are a few of these titles.</TE>
<TE>   "Heaven-making must be left to the imagination of the poets.
Without their help we can but trifle," cries Virginia Woolf (our
poet-in-prose) from the pages of "On Being Ill" (Paris Press: 64 pp.,
$20), a most unusual and long-neglected reverie on illness, language
and poetry -- reprinted by the sterling Paris Press with an
introduction by Hermione Lee and a reproduction of the book's
original 1930 Hogarth Press cover by Vanessa Bell. Woolf lets her
consciousness roam over the unpredictable terrain of sickness -- the
sick body, the sick mind -- and how difficult it is for us to find
words to describe this altered state.</TE>
<TE>   This is a brilliant and odd book, charged with restrained emotion
and sudden humor -- a book set aside and "lost" for some time: "Human
beings do not go hand in hand the whole stretch of the way.... Always
to have sympathy, always to be accompanied, always to be understood
would be intolerable. But in health the genial pretense must be kept
up and the effort renewed.... In illness this make-believe ceases."</TE>
<TE>   Maxine Hong Kingston has published a collection of essays titled
"To Be the Poet" (Harvard University Press: 144 pp., $19.95) -- a
jaunty, offhand grab bag of insights: "My two grandfathers sat atop
the stagecoach drawn by two black horses, / and laughed, and clapped
their hands. "Ah" they said. "Ah-h-h." Let me / have poetry to be
like that once again, and I shall die happy."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Pinsky's "Democracy, Culture and the Voice of Poetry"
(Princeton University Press: 88 pp., $14.95) attempts to "locate"
poetry within American culture -- the expression of the individual
voice is at the heart of democracy, yet poems also imagine readers
and fellow spirits. Pinsky is, by turns, whimsical and profound. He
makes the distinction, at one point, between poetry and "Hollywood":
"[S]houldn't poetry be part of show business? Or even, why does
poetry seem out of step with the entertainment industry? ... The form
of the question might be, 'Have your poems been set to music?' Well,
yes, but to paraphrase a great poet, I thought that I was doing that
when I wrote them."</TE>
<TE>   Books of poems -- known and less well known -- call for our
attention. Khaled Mattawa, a Libyan-born poet, has translated the
anarchical, musical poetry of the Iraqi poet Saadi Youssef in
"Without an Alphabet, Without a Face" (Graywolf Press: 216 pp., $16).
Mattawa has captured the sprawling, expansive lyrical passions of
this poet, who was born in Basra in 1934 and left Iraq in 1979 to
wander the world in exile. The translations feel at times slightly
unfocused, but they are always arresting and fresh:</TE>
<TE>   In the markets of bel-Abbes,</TE>
<TE>   in the city center,</TE>
<TE>   in the cafes where coffee grains never settle in the bottom of the
pot,</TE>
<TE>   and in the bars where the hour is always late,</TE>
<TE>   you will hear them whisper:</TE>
<TE>   'The emigrant has come.'</TE>
<TE>   "The Unswept Room" (Alfred A. Knopf: 96 pp., $15) by Sharon Olds
reconfirms this renowned poet's devastating emotional clarity and
eerie capacity to both ingratiate and shock. These poems, mainly
focusing on the mother-daughter dyad, are startling, ecstatic and
often a little reckless. From her poem "Mother": "Whatever she was to
me, she was / the human caught in something she could hardly / bear,
she was like a flying, keening / being limed and jessed, a small /
soprano of trees ...."</TE>
<TE>   The legendary New York poet Kenneth Koch died this year, and two
books of his appeared in 2002, from the same publisher. "Sun Out"
(Alfred A. Knopf: 144 pp., $25) features poems selected from 1952 to
1954, and "A Possible World" (Alfred A. Knopf: 112 pp., $24) is three
new long poems. It is nearly impossible to characterize the poems of
this dashing, sardonic, nutty, constantly questioning poet. Koch
could sail from the Surrealist</TE>
<TE>   Roof in me, tone-deaf flail!</TE>
<TE>   Clubfoot, mirror, cacophony!</TE>
<TE>   Orchestra of picture-mail</TE>
<TE>   Seed-catalogue of yellow finch-valentines,</TE>
<TE>   Drive mirth to sleep!</TE>
<TE>   to the reflective</TE>
<TE>   Better one day as a lion</TE>
<TE>   Then one hundred years as a mouse.</TE>
<TE>   Mussolini's theory</TE>
<TE>   Which gives rise to doubts.</TE>
<TE>   After this one day</TE>
<TE>   You would be a dead lion</TE>
<TE>   or a live mouse</TE>
<TE>   It would be the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   and preserve an absolute equilibrium.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Orlen's poems in "This Particular Eternity" (Ausable Press:
88 pp., $14) are written in a voice that speaks to us confidentially,
seductively. We believe in the speaker of these closely observed,
ruthlessly funny and touching poems. From "Butterflies That Save Us
From Ourselves":</TE>
<TE>   It came in pills, the mescaline, very fat, imposing translucent
capsules,</TE>
<TE>   And inside, the blue powder which promised, Jon said,</TE>
<TE>   To revert us to our true characters, then went into the bathroom</TE>
<TE>   With a pile of books, ran the water, and lay in the tub,</TE>
<TE>   Calling out every once in a while, How's everyone doing?</TE>
<TE>   Ellen Bryant Voigt's "Shadow of Heaven" (W.W. Norton: 72 pp., $21)
contains the finest poems to date of this infinitely versatile
lyrical poet, whose charged poems stay somehow utterly present,
connected to the immediate, yet always open to the sublime:</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal sings and sings: hunter's horn;</TE>
<TE>   then artillery. The round red door to its heart</TE>
<TE>   is always open. And now the same song</TE>
<TE>   from down the street, this time a mockingbird</TE>
<TE>   which, like the emperor's toy, can do it better.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth Stone, whose book "In the Next Galaxy" (Copper Canyon: 100
pp., $20) just won the National Book Award, has been a quiet presence
in American poetry. Her work has never been fashionable, yet she is
thought of as an Akhmatova-like figure. Like the great Russian
modernist's, her phrasing is declarative, succinct, self-contained
but filled with emotional power. Now, at 83, she is losing her
eyesight, but her poetic vision is keener than ever:</TE>
<TE>   Fog beads along the wires.</TE>
<TE>   Last night's implant in the brain,</TE>
<TE>   useless information after the facts,</TE>
<TE>   like the gradual glitch of shifting faults,</TE>
<TE>   almost unnoticed; in the way</TE>
<TE>   two birds streak through the air,</TE>
<TE>   in the wing language of April,</TE>
<TE>   above them the dark metaphor</TE>
<TE>   of two soundless fighter jets.</TE>
<TE>   "As water given sugar sweetens, given salts grows salty, / we
become our choices," writes Jane Hirshfield in "Given Sugar, Given
Salt" (HarperPerennial: 96 pp., $13.95). Few other poets honor what
Hirshfield honors with such natural affection and precision -- the
ordinary objects of life and the deep current of poetry that flows
through them: "Shy, the scissors and spoons, the blue mug. / Hesitant
even the towels, / for all their intimate knowledge and scent of
fresh bleach."</TE>
<TE>   The poems in "Rock Harbor" (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux: 128 pp., $20)
by Carl Phillips are both formal and casual, giving us the lineaments
of interior life in beautiful, attenuated, enigmatic style: "an
unexpected heat in late / October brings / now the worker bees /
confused, instinctive, / back."</TE>
<TE>   "Three Poets of Modern Korea" (Sarabande Books: 72 pp., $13.95)
introduces us to the work of Yi Sang, Hahm Dong-Seon and Choi
Young-Mi, as translated by Yu Jung-Yul and James Kimbrell. We are
given three generations here -- and three completely different voices
that nevertheless provide a clear sense of the range of poetry within
contemporary Korean culture.</TE>
<TE>   Had I space enough and time, I would talk about poems by Geoffrey
Hill, Anne Carson, Paul Muldoon, Cleopatra Mathis, Cal Bedient ("The
Violence of the Mourning"), David St. John ("Prism"), Rodney Jones,
Robert MacDowell ("On Foot, in Flames"), Virgil Suarez, Robin Behn
("Horizon Note"), Mark Doty ("Seeing Venice: Bellotto's Grand
Canal"), Elena Byrne, Ralph Angel, Gretchen Mattox, Honor Moore
("Darling") and many others. Contemporary poets mourn our loss of the
great poet (born in Kashmir) Agha Shahid Ali. It is imperative that
we read poetry -- and not just what might fashionably be termed the
"best of." Why? It is difficult to get the news from poems, as
William Carlos Williams remarked, yet "men die miserably every day
for lack of what is found there."</TE>

<HD>A pair of ring masters</HD>
<DH>New Zealand is abuzz about its towering 'genius,' Peter
Jackson, lord of the trilogy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Colbert</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Wellington, New Zealand</DL>
<LD>He's described locally as a "genius masquerading as an ordinary
person," a creative whirlwind, financial powerhouse and folk hero
rolled into one. Yet even that can't quite measure the effect "The
Lord of the Rings" director Peter Jackson has had on his native
country.</LD>
<LD>   Certainly, when one of the world's smaller countries, New Zealand
(population 3.8 million), snags one of the biggest deals in cinema
history, it's bound to stir things up. But Jackson's wildly ambitious
film trilogy has shaken up his world the way Gandalf shook up
Middle-earth; he's left no part of the kingdom untouched.</LD>
<LD>   The three films, all shot here, have brought in hundreds of
millions of dollars to New Zealand's economy, turned the country into
an international movie-making force -- the capital has been nicknamed
"Wellywood" -- and made Jackson perhaps the country's best-known
export. Excitement here is especially high now as Jackson gets set to
release the second part of the trilogy, "The Two Towers," later this
month (it opens in Los Angeles on Dec. 18).</LD>
<TE>   To be sure, there have been success stories here before, from Mt.
Everest conqueror Sir Edmund Hillary to the All Blacks rugby team to
director Jane Campion, whose film "The Piano" became a worldwide
sensation and won an Oscar for local actress Anna Paquin. But none
comes close to the sweeping tide of popularity for Jackson, the
country's latest and greatest hero.</TE>
<TE>   After directing cult horror movies ("Bad Taste," "Braindead" and
"Meet the Feebles") and the 1994 art-house hit "Heavenly Creatures,"
the 41-year-old Jackson has become an international celebrity with
the "Rings" trilogy. Perhaps because of the nation's egalitarian
pioneer roots, underdogs are championed here, highfliers cut down to
size. But that's not the case with Jackson, who has elicited
widespread approval from the locals. Kids think he's cool,
grandmothers a godsend, and taxi drivers and tradesmen admire his
work ethic and self-taught skills.</TE>
<TE>   They regard with fondness his individual style, which is so
incongruous with corporate success: the ungroomed, casual attire --
the trademark shorts, T-shirt, (ideally) bare feet, longish unkempt
hair and spectacles. "Right from the start, Peter was different:
gifted, fiercely independent, determinedly film-literate and very
hands-on. He could put his personal stamp on a project yet work
closely as a team player," says Tom Cardy, a journalist with the
Dominion Post newspaper in Wellington.</TE>
<TE>   At Wellington's Te Papa Museum, which is hosting a "Lord of the
Rings" exhibit, a 14-year-old schoolboy offers his astute analysis of
Jackson: "He's like a studious nerd, like Harry Potter grown up and
fatter -- but still a kid at heart. And we like that."</TE>
<TE>   "Lord of the Rings" has made the low-key Jackson a financial power
-- as well as power broker -- in New Zealand. He's worked closely
with the government, which has even created an unofficial "Lord of
the Rings" minister to promote the films around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly "Rings" has made him wealthy; according to a
conservative estimate by the New Zealand National Business Review, in
excess of $20 million (in U.S. dollars). According to press reports,
his share from "The Fellowship of the Ring," the first of the
trilogy, was 5% of New Line Cinema's gross (the film took in $860
million worldwide at the box office and received 13 Academy Award
nominations, winning four), so the real figure is likely to be much
higher, and with the release of two additional films, fast
increasing.</TE>
<TE>   "There's more than one Peter," says Ruth Harley, chief executive
of the New Zealand Film Commission. "There's the ordinary person next
door, and also [the] extremely competent runner of a very large
business, one of the sharpest deal makers in Hollywood, and an
extraordinary filmmaker."</TE>
<TE>   He owns several houses (his own quite unpretentious); Wingnut
Productions; Three Foot Six, the company especially formed for the
trilogy; the Film Unit, a production facility purchased from the
government in 2000; and he is a partner in Weta Workshop, an
Oscar-winning special-effects company he set up almost 10 years ago
with friends and partners Richard Taylor, Jamie Selkirk and Tania
Rodger.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's grandiose movie project (the three films cost more than
$300 million and took 18 months to shoot) was financed by New Line
Cinema. Jackson and New Line worked in close synergy with New
Zealand's government, having created an unprecedented troika (of
country, studio, production house) that has changed the way films are
made here.</TE>
<TE>   The prime minister, Helen Clark, who's also the arts minister,
believes that the success of "Lord of the Rings" shows how creative
industries can be used to boost the national economy. "Look at the
place of Hollywood in the U.S. economy," she says, though she has
clashed with Jackson over continuing tax breaks for studios and
filmmakers who shoot in New Zealand. "The creative industries are the
fastest-growing part of the international service sector. And we have
to heed that and get our share of it."</TE>
<TE>   The success of "The Lord of the Rings," Jackson hopes, will act as
a catalyst for the New Zealand film industry. "There are obvious
intangible benefits to national identity and awareness, but this has
hit with such a massive scale that the New Zealand film industry has
never experienced anything like it."</TE>
<TE>   To Clark, "Peter is a new kind of hero, a brilliant guy who had
enormous faith in his ability to make movies. New Zealanders respect
that, rejoice in his success and have got the message that there can
be a lot of spinoffs from this global phenomenon."</TE>
<TE>   The 'Ring' treadmill</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's office bears testimony to the colorful imagination of
the cineaste and the child within. Set well back off the street in a
quiet beachside suburb of Wellington, the nation's capital, the Tudor
house is filled with brightly painted model planes and a huge poster
and sculpture from the original "King Kong," his favorite film.</TE>
<TE>   Bright walls are offset by billowing curtains. Downstairs, glass
cabinets display a wide range of collectibles from the "Lord of the
Rings" trilogy; Weta bought a license from New Line to create a line
of "Rings" products.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is still on the "Lord of the Rings" treadmill. The
exhaustion, if not visible, is audible. He has recently overseen
production of the special-edition DVD, released last month, of
"Fellowship of the Ring" and 10,000 prints for the upcoming release
of "The Two Towers." There are constant demands on his time. His
mantra -- "One day at a time. Each day to perfection" -- is
undergoing the kind of test Frodo and the Fellowship would
understand.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson may be a folk hero here, but you wouldn't know it from
talking to him. For one thing, he goes out of his way to assert that
he's just a regular guy with a family. And he hasn't paid much
attention to the cult status that "The Lord of the Rings" has brought
him.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been so caught up making the films that I live in a very
insular world at the moment; not because I choose to, but as somebody
who's in the middle of making three very complicated movies over a
four- to five-year period. I'm lost in my work," he says. "It's like
being on a train you can't get off, furiously building the rails in
front of the train."</TE>
<TE>   All the same, he and Fran Walsh -- a co-screenwriter on "Lord of
the Rings" and the mother of his two children -- are discussing
future film projects, "the next one probably something much smaller,
just as a break," Jackson notes.</TE>
<TE>   Weta, meanwhile, is branching out to television and related
ventures. Through a new offshoot company, TV Uncharted, it's
developing four shows for international distribution. Jackson's
corporate philosophy is intuitive and lacking in hierarchy. "It's
about natural progression, not five-year plans," Jackson explains.
"You listen to the murmur in the workshop. You've got to know what
the group feels like doing. After ["Lord of the Rings"], we had 21
sculptors who wanted to continue the craft, so what do you do? Create
a merchandising company that celebrates sculpture."</TE>
<TE>   Notes Weta partner Taylor: "It's not about amassing kingdoms. It's
about pride and ownership." Making the trilogy at home -- the films
were shot over an 18-month period from 1999 to 2001 -- wasn't about
proving that New Zealanders could do it. "We're no better than anyone
else. It's just that it's uniquely of our culture," Taylor says over
tea at Weta's 68,000-square-foot creature and special-effects
workshop.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the country's spectacular scenery became a crucial
component of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, forming a majestic,
even otherworldly, backdrop for the films. In "The Two Towers,"
snow-covered mountains, pristine forests and secluded rivers play a
crucial role in bringing J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy Middle-earth to
life.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who do their work in Hollywood are the best in the
world, but they're doing it in the environment where they feel
comfortable," Taylor adds. "We're living in this little country,
where we've been working out of tin sheds and sharing a filmmaking
psyche with Peter."</TE>
<TE>   'Stuff of dreams'</TE>
<TE>   Taylor notes that he and Jackson "grew up making up our own
worlds. Limitless horizons and space give your mind clarity and room
to roam."</TE>
<TE>   In Jackson's case, entertainment was black-and-white TV and books.
When he first read "The Lord of the Rings" as an 18-year-old photo
engraver for a local newspaper, it had a huge impact, but it didn't
transform his life until much later. "I wasn't even working in the
industry then," he says. "At that point, it was the stuff of dreams."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until 1995, when he was planning to make an original
fantasy film to follow "Heavenly Creatures," that Jackson found that
his mind kept drifting back to "The Lord of the Rings." By then,
Jackson was not only directing, but he was also acquiring the
technology necessary for his breakthrough.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson and his friends had already formed Weta because none of
them could afford to buy the computer they were leasing for the
making of "Heavenly Creatures." "We knew the future of visual effects
lay predominantly in digital hardware, so we pooled our resources and
acquired the one computer which has grown into the largest computing
power in the Southern Hemisphere," says Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   The government is trying to build on Jackson's success, including
establishing a special film production fund, as an incentive to get
international financing for local filmmakers who shoot in New
Zealand. "We're providing them with opportunities to do bigger films
in hopes that we can breed more Peters," explains Prime Minister
Clark.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, cloning Jackson or identifying others of his caliber
appears to be a government mission -- in fact, it's even appointed an
unofficial "Lord of the Rings" minister, the Hon. Pete Hodgson, who
is a minister for foreign affairs and trade in the government.
"Peter's an ordinary bloke who's achieved the extraordinary," says
Hodgson. "He only sees solutions. We'll be hard-pressed to find
another like him." Hodgson's department will be sponsoring
promotional premiere events for "The Two Towers" at diplomatic
missions around the world, including Los Angeles, in the next few
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Peter's success has opened the door to other possibilities, and
the beauty of being a small country is that you make things happen a
lot faster," Hodgson says.</TE>
<TE>   The government estimates that the trilogy will bring about $400
million to the New Zealand economy, with significant boosts to
employment, tourism, screen production and related services. The
trilogy has "generated interest from around the world," notes Paul
Voight, who manages an investment firm that works on film projects in
New Zealand. "We've had inquiries from Europe and China, Japan, Korea
and India, which for us are new markets."</TE>
<TE>   It's more difficult to quantify the trilogy's indirect benefits,
such as on tourism. Evidence at this point is anecdotal, but while
tourism in other parts of the world has recorded severe downturns due
to the Sept. 11 terror attacks (and more recently a deadly bombing in
Bali), New Zealand's reputation as a safe destination has combined
with interest generated by "The Lord of the Rings" to keep its
figures booming.</TE>
<TE>   The government campaign should be aided by a "Lord of the Rings"
exhibit that's scheduled to open Dec. 19 at Wellington's Te Papa
Museum. After February, the exhibit will tour for two years to
several international museums, including possibly one in Boston. The
exhibit will showcase an array of movie props, costumes, jewelry,
designs and accessories and will feature interactive and high-tech
components.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, Jackson's hometown, the scenic and culturally hip
Wellington, has reaped the greatest direct benefit from "The Lord of
the Rings." Its annual tourism is estimated to be growing by more
than 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Just a few years ago, New Zealand's major directing talents left
their homeland to pursue careers at a higher level in Australia or
the U.S. "Now, the cool thing is to return," says the film
commission's Harley.</TE>
<TE>   Two local talents -- Lee Tamahori, who directed the new James Bond
film, "Die Another Day," as well as "Once Were Warriors," a drama set
among New Zealand's Maoris; and Vincent Ward ("Map of the Human
Heart") -- are coming back, each shooting a big-budget 19th century
drama. "All we need is for Jane Campion to make a film here and we'll
have a full house," Harley says.</TE>
<TE>   Campion (who still has family and a house in the Wellington area)
does return regularly. Recently, in fact, the owner of the Chocolate
Fish, an unpretentious cafe in the beachside suburb of Miramar that
was a hangout for cast and crew during the "Lord of the Rings" shoot,
had to pacify two disappointed tourists who had made the trip
especially, hoping to catch Jackson or one of the trilogy's actors.
"I'm sorry we can't oblige," the owner said. "But you do have an
Oscar winner at the table next to you -- Jane Campion."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson has also been the subject of some controversy here as
well. There are some here who claim that his purchase of the Film
Unit in 2000 -- a government-run production facility -- was another
step in his empire-building, rather than an altruistic gesture. And
Jackson and the prime minister don't see eye to eye on continuing tax
breaks for studios who film in New Zealand, a concession the
government granted to New Line but now wants to end.</TE>
<TE>   "The films were well underway before we came into government,"
Clark says. "It was a giant loophole and actually cost the government
and taxpayers a ton of money."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson bristles at this. "It's like you're running to the
finishing line and you shoot yourself in the foot," he says. "New
Zealand can earn serious money, and the situation is not being
assisted by shutting down tax breaks, especially considering what
Australia and Canada can offer. I think it's an appalling piece of
policy."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's clear that Jackson has become a national treasure
here. "You can't overestimate what Peter has done," Harley says. .
"He's changed the scale of people's ambitions."</TE>

<LD>Robert Hilburn's review of Mariah Carey's "Charmbracelet" ("Searching
Hard for Signs of Life in Carey's Music," Dec. 1) is quite easily one
of the worst reviews I've ever read and not just because of his
perception of the album. Not only does he fail to comment on the
actual songs, the content, the music, but he mentions one song from
the entire album. How was her voice? Is this an R&amp;B album? Is this a
country album? How's the production?</LD>
<LD>   Oh, I'm sorry, I must have been mistaken and led to believe this
was a "review" of the actual album and not of Ms. Carey herself.
Hilburn's bias toward her is apparent in the second sentence of the
"review."</LD>
<LD>   But at least he felt something toward Ms. Carey and her music. I
felt nothing from reading Hilburn's review except a distaste for this
type of so-called journalism, and knowing that there is a nice guitar
solo from the album "Charmbracelet."</LD>

<LD>For the greater good</LD>
<LD>   Nicolai Ouroussoff laments the lack of social consciousness and
future-oriented impact among architects in this country ("At the
Elite's Altar," Dec. 1). While this revelation goes to his credit, it
is a shallow and insincere attempt to redeem his past glorification
of architects serving their own mission of eternity and the cultural
elite without conscience.</LD>
<LD>   Ouroussoff has made himself an advocate of architecture as
aesthetic discipline only, even as he quotes Rem Koolhaas and Daniel
Libeskind as voices of humanism and social consciousness. Exactly
those architects stand for the aestheticizing and excessive
conceptualizing of the architectural mind-field in order to appeal to
a cultural and esoteric elite.</LD>
<TE>   How can we believe his sincerity about a subject when the very
forum that could generate a popular support for issues like public
housing, public open space and public buildings only adulates the
same elitist architectural ideas over and over again? Since when are
these fashionable architects of today advocates of the messy process
of creating good architecture for the needy and underrepresented?
They will get much more star coverage to design a $40-million store
in Soho than a low-cost housing project for 500 families in a
not-so-fashionable neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of lamenting in a polemical and general way about the lack
of architectural engagement of architects, he overlooks the real
things that are going on right in our backyards and frontyards.
(Architects like Pugh + Scarpa or Koning Eizenberg, just to name a
few, who create meaningful, sustainable and technological innovative
architecture for housing projects in L.A.; or the various nonprofit
organizations, like Livable Places, which struggle to create
architecturally inspiring projects in underserved areas.)</TE>

<LD>Just wanted to provide a possible clarification for Silas Mariano,
who said The Times made an "inaccurate" count of 19 Bond films
(Letters, Nov. 24).</LD>
<LD>   They may be counted this way when considering that the films
"Casino Royale" and "Never Say Never Again" are not viewed as
"official" Bond films -- regardless of who played James Bond --
because they were not produced by MGM/UA and Eon (neither held film
rights to either project.) MGM/UA and Eon are considered the
"official" Bond filmmakers because they produced the first
full-length feature -- in this case, Sean Connery's "Dr. No."</LD>
<LD>   And don't forget, there was also a production of "Casino Royale"
made for American television starring Barry Nelson as Jimmy Bond,
American card shark, in 1954 for the CBS television series "Climax."
Since this was not feature-length and had a considerably different
take on Bond, it is also excluded from an "official" status.</LD>

<LD>I would like to praise Roy Rivenburg for finally exposing the
shameful shams that are the for-profit poetry contests all over the
U.S. ("There Once Was a Poet From L.A.," Nov. 24).</LD>
<LD>   Eighteen years ago, I participated in a contest put on by John T.
Campbell's "World of Poetry" press. They convinced me that I was the
sole winner of the "Golden Poet Award of 1984" and so convinced me to
fly to Reno to accept my award and praise. I spent more than $400 to
go to the convention and more money to have my picture and
inscription included in their prestigious (yeah, right!) poetry
anthology, which they also convinced me would be distributed
throughout the literary world.</LD>
<LD>   When I got to the convention and discovered 2,000 other excited
poets who were all receiving the same "Golden Poet Award," I was
humiliated and devastated.</LD>
<TE>   Although I, along with a few other now-angry poets, took some
measures to expose this heart-wrenching invasion of our souls (we
notified the American Poetry Society and a local newspaper), we could
not stop this example of free enterprise at its worst.</TE>
<TE>   Poetry is very personal. It comes from your innermost soul. It is
difficult to bare it to the world. Every poet hopes and dreams of
some kind of recognition for his or her heartfelt labor. To have it
cruelly trivialized by profit-mongers is a personal invasion.</TE>
<TE>   I know there are other scam contests out there, and I inform other
poets and would-be victims of the true nature of these contests
whenever I can. Thank you so much, Mr. Rivenburg, for doing the same
so sublimely.</TE>

<HD>A pair of ring masters</HD>
<DH>To Scorsese, they were always mean streets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Lieberman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>New York</DL>
<LD>It's hard to imagine what sort of films Martin Scorsese might have
made -- if any -- had he remained in Queens. He draws laughs when he
confesses to an audience here that he spent his first years in a
two-family house there, with a tree out back. "It had leaves!" he
adds in that rapid-fire voice of his, and they roar again at the
notion that America's great filmmaker of the streets might have grown
up around anything green. It wasn't until 1950, when he was 7, that
his father had a fight with the landlord and the family moved in with
his grandparents on Elizabeth Street, in Manhattan's Little Italy.
That's where the asthmatic little boy sat by the third-story window
and gazed down at the grocery stores and the bums stumbling over from
the Bowery and at the local tough guys, of course.</LD>
<LD>   He was so frail he couldn't join even the benign play down there
("anything with a ball -- no good"), so his parents took him to the
movies. Then on Friday nights the Sicilian relatives would crowd in
front of their 16-inch RCA television to watch weekly broadcasts of
Italian films, the neo-realist classics of Rossellini and De Sica
seeming like home movies to them. And when the boy later was able to
make films himself, he began with his own version of home movies,
re-creating what he'd seen framed out that window.</LD>
<TE>   The film that launched Scorsese's career began with his own voice
saying, "You don't make up for your sins in church -- you do it in
the streets," and the first image was of a then-unknown Harvey Keitel
waking from a nightmare to stare into a mirror, until the sound of
sirens interrupted, followed by a Ronettes tune, "Be My Baby," whose
pounding first notes were timed perfectly to the descent of Keitel's
head back onto the pillow. Scorsese turned 30 the night they filmed
the climactic scene of "Mean Streets" and his birthday present to
himself was a role. The once sickly shut-in played a silent assassin
in back of a car who shoots down another near-unknown he'd cast,
Robert De Niro.</TE>
<TE>   Three decades later, they all got together again last month -- De
Niro, Keitel and others from Scorsese's creative family -- to
celebrate the 60th birthday of a director still making movies about
those streets. The day of the party at a restaurant in the Village,
he still was tinkering with his new one, which tries to imagine what
life there was like a century and a half ago. Scorsese still was
giving himself cameos, too, except that in "Gangs of New York" he's
an uptown aristocrat of the 1860s, one of the "swells." Though that
reflects where he's come -- he does live uptown now, with all the
perks -- Scorsese insists that the casting stemmed only from his wish
to have his wife and young daughter with him in the film. However
tempted he was to play one of the desperate souls in Five Points, the
battleground of gangs led by Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day-Lewis,
he was not about to put his infant girl in muddy streets with the
pigs roaming loose. So the Scorseses play rich folks, the sort the
rest of us rabble can only glimpse briefly, through the window.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm told by some people close to me that I am rich," he said the
other day. "Though after this film, no." Then he laughed as heartily
as the audiences that hear about his tree, though it's no joke that
he put millions into "Gangs," a film he dreamed of making all those
decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what else he thinks is at stake now that it's a reality:
"Can I continue to work? It's as simple as that."</TE>
<TE>   Encounter with a 1928 book</TE>
<TE>   Like many of his films, "Gangs" has its roots, Scorsese says, in
stories that "came out of the cobblestone." During his Elizabeth
Street days, he sometimes found refuge in nearby Old St. Patrick's
Cathedral, built in 1809. It struck him that the name didn't sound
Italian at all, and his schoolboy questions led to tales of "the
people that came before us." One told how early Irish immigrants once
massed in front of the cathedral to repel a mob of Know Nothings, the
"nativists" who despised the riffraff fleeing Ireland's potato
famine. Scorsese decided that his neighborhood showdown marked "the
acceptance of what America's supposed to be ... letting in the
immigrants."</TE>
<TE>   Years later, he became intrigued again by those Irish defenders
when he stumbled upon a 1928 book by Herbert Asbury, who chronicled
sensational tales from the American underworld. Scorsese can give the
exact day -- New Year's Day, 1970 -- that he read Asbury's "The Gangs
of New York." He was visiting friends house-sitting a cottage on Long
Island. It was on the shelves.</TE>
<TE>   The book had no plot, but it told of club-wielding bands roaming
the Five Points area of Lower Manhattan, where a courthouse stands
today. They dressed in elaborate costumes and called themselves Plug
Uglies, Bowery B'hoys, Dead Rabbits and the like. Some lived in an
old brewery where a beggar girl was said to have been killed for a
penny. Even the visiting Charles Dickens, the voice of England's
underclass, was shocked by the "dirt and filth" he saw at Five
Points, all the "drunken frays."</TE>
<TE>   Writer-director Paul Schrader says that when he met Scorsese in
Los Angeles in 1972, the New Yorker "mentioned he wanted to film two
books, 'Last Temptation of Christ' and 'Gangs of New York,' a
statement I thought grandiose coming from someone whose most
prestigious credit was a Roger Corman film," that being the drive-in
friendly "Boxcar Bertha." Another friend, musician Robbie Robertson,
thought the "Gangs" book "ideal" for Scorsese. Why? Because it showed
a hidden New York that was the opposite of charming, "the skankiest,
most corrupt armpit of the world."</TE>
<TE>   Scorsese did seem intent on countering sanitized visions of the
streets. Woody Allen could set Manhattan to Gershwin's soaring music,
not him. Francis Ford Coppola could portray Mafia chiefs as the
embodiment of honor and family values in "The Godfather," but that
wasn't how Scorsese saw the wannabes below his window.</TE>
<TE>   He enlisted his best friend, Jay Cocks, a Time magazine film
writer, to work up a script for "Gangs." They had a draft by 1977. By
then, Scorsese had directed "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore" and
"Taxi Driver," and he and Cocks fantasized about creating a "Gangs"
franchise, ending their first movie with New York's 1863 draft riots
and having their characters help build the Brooklyn Bridge in "Gangs
II."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever clout Scorsese had earned by then, it wasn't enough. The
studios passed. "It's too big, it's too expensive, it's too crazy,
it's too violent -- whatever," Cocks recalls. And that was before
United Artists' disastrous "Heaven's Gate" made Hollywood leery of
indulging any director's costly pet project.</TE>
<TE>   Scorsese is the first to say, "My films aren't for everybody." But
the irony with "Gangs" was that he was proposing, for once, to
embrace a Hollywood formula.</TE>
<TE>   He normally was more interested in a culture than plot, in showing
how Ray Liotta dished out the tip money in "GoodFellas," say, while
winding his way to a front-row table at the Copa. Scorsese also
"didn't care" if audiences empathized with his "really negative"
characters, such as Joe Pesci's mobsters, who might kill you for
looking at him wrong. "Yet some people identified," Scorsese notes,
and that was his genius.</TE>
<TE>   With "Gangs," however, he wanted to try his hand at an established
genre, "the American epic ... something sweeping ... with a
traditional story and a traditional conflict." He still relied
heavily on "milieu," and researched scores of true-life details, from
how bar patrons in 1860 might gulp liquor through hoses to how
pickpockets used fake arms for cover. But he also envisioned main
characters with familiar roles, "the ingenue and the villain and the
hero."</TE>
<TE>   He and Cocks settled on a revenge story, of a son having to avenge
a father's death, an ancient theme that has driven popular films from
"Godfather II" to "Batman" and "Harry Potter." Their script pitted a
young Irish immigrant, Amsterdam Vallon, against the leader of the
nativists, William Cutting, or "Bill the Butcher," who had slain his
father, the head of the Dead Rabbits. During his quest for justice,
the hero falls for an alluring street thief, Jennie Everdeane.</TE>
<TE>   The filmmaker who demythologized the Mafia decided to do the
opposite with these gangs. "We extrapolated a lot. It's a figurative
film, not a snapshot from history," says Cocks, who began the process
with the first line of dialogue -- the father instructing his son
that "blood stays on the blade" as he slices into his own cheek,
ritualistically preparing for battle.</TE>
<TE>   An actual 19th century brawler known as "Bill the Butcher" ("I'll
taste your mutton yet," he'd threaten) was shot in a gambling house.
But the script's gangs eschew guns for more primitive hand-to-hand
combat.</TE>
<TE>   In his other work, Scorsese kept a tight focus on bondings of men
-- into mob crews and rat packs -- that through his lens seemed more
primal even than family. But here he consciously evoked ancient
myths, by having his gang leaders await death like a priest in Sir
James George Frazer's "The Golden Bough," who prowls a sacred grove
at night with his sword drawn though he knows that his successor must
murder him, sooner or later, because that is "the rule of the
sanctuary."</TE>
<TE>   Not until 1989 did he decide that that the hero and villain needed
a more complex relationship. During a time when his own parents were
ailing, he took the script on a trip to Japan and thought that
Amsterdam Vallon and Bill the Butcher could become a surrogate father
and son to each other. Cocks had a revised script by 1993. Still no
sale. "I never believed it was going to get made," Scorsese says.</TE>
<TE>   Who can figure Hollywood?</TE>
<TE>   By his mid-50s, Scorsese's filmmaking was becoming more internal,
and less commercial, with "Kundun," about the early life of the Dalai
Lama, then "Bringing Out the Dead," about a paramedic desperate to
save anyone on New York's streets. Scorsese was filming that in
January 1999 when Mike Ovitz visited. The onetime superagent had
formed a management company whose client list included the heartthrob
of "Titanic."</TE>
<TE>   "Mike Ovitz came to me on the set -- 'Which picture would you like
to make? I have Leo DiCaprio.' "</TE>
<TE>   'Street' smarts</TE>
<TE>   Asked what "the street" is about, Scorsese says: "Survival.</TE>
<TE>   "You learn rather quickly how to stay alive, if you want to stay
alive. That means emotionally, psychologically, every which way." He
views making a film the same way. "It's a hellish process," he says,
and he does not pretend that "Gangs" was an exception.</TE>
<TE>   During four hours of conversation in his offices above Park
Avenue, Scorsese grew testy only once, when asked what input the
studio had on the finished "Gangs."</TE>
<TE>   "This is about the business of Miramax and Weinstein and me and
all that stupid stuff," he says. "I'm so tired. I can't go through
this." He was exhausted, in fact, from a promotional trip to Japan
with DiCaprio. But he was tired also of the gossips who seemed
startled to discover "it's a big movie, it's over budget and the
studio and the director are fighting. No kidding? What else is new?"</TE>
<TE>   Scorsese recalls being summoned by a studio executive in 1976 when
"Taxi Driver" was headed for an X rating. The message? " 'Cut it for
an R or we cut it. Now get out.' That was the meeting."</TE>
<TE>   Many lifetime achievement awards later, he may have a bit more
pull. But he knows that the reality remains the same for any
filmmaker who needs a studio to come up with a fortune: "More money,
less freedom." Though much of the financing for "Gangs" is being
covered by the sale of overseas rights -- the Initial Entertainment
Group paid $67 million for that privilege -- it is being distributed
domestically by Miramax Films, which also has a stake. That meant
Scorsese had to play out the money-freedom dynamic with the imposing
Harvey Weinstein, who made his mark garnering wide American audiences
-- and Oscars -- for indie-style films that others might have written
off as too artsy.</TE>
<TE>   They made "Gangs" at Rome's Cinecitta Studios, which Scorsese
considers "sanctified turf," for it spawned many of the Italian
classics he used to watch on his parents' small black-and-white TV.
Technical experts turned the back lot into 19th century New York for
his 137 days of shooting that concluded in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Cocks, who visited at the end, says he witnessed "the usual"
haggling, from "It's gotta be shorter" to "Do you really need this
elephant?" And when Scorsese was ready to film the final
confrontation between DiCaprio and Day-Lewis, "they said, 'OK,
Saturday, it's all over.' He said, 'But I haven't got ....' 'Sorry.
Money's gone. You're gone. Goodbye.' "</TE>
<TE>   Yet the elephant stayed -- running loose from P.T. Barnum's museum
during the draft riots -- and Scorsese got to reshoot the finale.</TE>
<TE>   "The trick is, you never give up," Scorsese says. "You try to keep
shooting until they take the camera out of your hand."</TE>
<TE>   In the annals of overruns, "Gangs" -- originally expected to cost
$90 million -- is far from a record breaker. "Now they say
100-something, 105, 108," Scorsese says.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein was among those toasting the director at his birthday
party Nov. 17. Whatever was said in the heat of editing and cutting
-- to 2 hours, 38 minutes -- Scorsese won't blame the boss if the
audience doesn't like it. "Whatever we took out, we took out ... I
have total responsibility. I signed it," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Harvey and a bunch of guys say, 'Marty, you know you can put this
in the DVD. I said, 'Harvey, there's no DVD.... This is the
director's cut.' For better or for worse, under the circumstances, in
1999 to 2002, [with] Miramax, Joe Roth, Mike Ovitz, Rick Yorn,
Leonardo DiCaprio" -- he names 15 people who had input, from the
actors to the agents -- "this is the result."</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't done, either. Tired as he was, Scorsese was still the
detail freak. He was working to make sure the end credits hit the
screen to the beat of the closing music by U2, "The Hands That Built
America."</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to let go of the damn thing," he says. "It's like a
child getting out. Let it go, that's the end of it. Let it go, let it
be seen, let people talk about it, let them argue ... I got what I
wanted ultimately."</TE>
<TE>   He also may have gotten a bigger piece of the picture than he'd
count on. As the cost rose, he volunteered to put "most" of his
salary back into the film, reportedly $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   "It puts me in a nice state right now. I am now, what's the word,
inspired to work again," he says, laughing again. "Because I need
to."</TE>
<TE>   The year of the gossips</TE>
<TE>   Scorsese has never been one for Hollywood endings, but this film
was supposed to have one for him. After the shoot wrapped in the
spring of 2001, the expectation was that "Gangs" would be ready for
release last Christmas and that Weinstein would work the Miramax
magic to gain him the Oscar that has been denied him to date.</TE>
<TE>   Scorsese is not so much the artiste that he doesn't care about
such matters. He may believe that what's most important is how a work
holds up before future generations, but "I have to tell you, coming
where I come from, and struggling to do what I tried to do over the
years, it's great to get the recognition."</TE>
<TE>   He says it never was realistic to expect "Gangs" to be ready a
year ago, and that he and Weinstein worried that it might not have
been appropriate to show chaos in lower Manhattan so close to 9/11.</TE>
<TE>   But the extra year has seen the initial buzz of anticipation give
way to the gossip about him and Harvey, and the is-something-wrong
speculation. "Gangs" also lost its novelty as the film that would
reestablish DiCaprio as an actor and star after a couple of
post-"Titanic" flops. For a while, it was scheduled for release the
same day -- Christmas -- as the film DiCaprio worked on next, "Catch
Me if You Can," in which the 28-year-old actor is not asked to
stretch as much, playing a teenage con man, and is guided by the most
crowd-pleasing of directors, Steven Spielberg. After a game of studio
chicken, "Gangs" was moved up to Dec. 20.</TE>
<TE>   Scorsese and Spielberg have known each other since they were
fledglings in Los Angeles, and Scorsese joined the DreamWorks chief
for a recent screening of "Catch Me if You Can" in New York. Other
than DiCaprio, there's little in common between their holiday
offerings. Yet they inevitably will be compared. "Anything you do,
you're pitted against each other in the industry," Scorsese says.
"And by the end of the year, you're pitted against each other because
of academy consideration."</TE>
<TE>   He finds himself, then, in the classic Scorsese moment.</TE>
<TE>   Those are when he reminds us how precarious life is, as when Pesci
in "GoodFellas" seems to take offense at Ray Liotta's remark that
he's "funny," and no one knows if the crazy little guy is going to
kill Liotta or let him in on the joke. There's a moment like that in
"Gangs," when DiCaprio, as the hero Amsterdam Vallon, finally beds
the ingenue-pickpocket, played by Cameron Diaz, then wakes up to find
the murderous Bill the Butcher seated in a chair, watching them.
Playing the butcher in a handlebar mustache and top hat, the
45-year-old Day-Lewis without question steals the film. He's also a
vintage Scorsese character, frightening and intriguingly appealing.
Whatever formulas the director may have followed this time, he again
served up a killer we can't take our eyes off. As he sits by the bed,
we don't know if Bill the Butcher will slaughter Vallon or tell him,
"Whatever your heart desires, young man."</TE>
<TE>   Such moments are both funny and scary, but what defines them,
Scorsese notes, is "it could go any way."</TE>
<TE>   There are many reasons to pull for him: for how some of his films
were seen at first as too edgy, or violent, only to be declared,
later, the best of their decade; for how his work is so imitated you
see clay-animated figures on TV asking themselves, "You talkin' to
me?"; or for his campaigns, with Spielberg and others, to preserve
old films, both classic and mundane, before their negatives
disintegrate.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he understands people pull for him," says Schrader,
Scorsese's screenwriter on "Taxi Driver," "Raging Bull" and other
films. "He also understands that as many, if not more, pull for him
to fail. A director who is not paranoid is delusional."</TE>
<TE>   Even a healthy paranoia allows for optimism, though. After his
return from Japan, Scorsese was heartened that some early viewers had
seen the gangs of Five Points as more than a precursor to what
happened in America -- as a parable for the current moment in history
when nation states everywhere seem less significant than tribal bands
built around ritualized terror. "It's worldwide," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But how could he have imagined that his scenes of draft riots,
which first intrigued him during an unpopular Vietnam War three
decades ago, would hit the screen amid new war preparations, only in
a time of patriotic fervor?</TE>
<TE>   Friends say Scorsese is more nervous than they have ever seen him,
as when he says, "the only recognition I want now is to be able to
make another picture."</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't mean that literally. He has already signed on to do
another film with DiCaprio, "Aviator," about the young Howard Hughes,
an obsessive compulsive who kept testing airplanes even after he kept
crashing them. Before self-destructive pride and head injuries turned
him into a recluse, Hughes also got his dream project off the ground.
He flew the enormous Spruce Goose for less than a minute, but fly it
he did.</TE>
<TE>   Scorsese has no firm plans after "Aviator."</TE>
<TE>   He once believed a director should be able to make any kind of
film, whether a musical, light comedy or pirate movie. But while he's
dabbled in such fare over the years, he's never felt comfortable as a
director for hire.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard for me to make somebody else's picture," he says, and
that's what worries him -- having to do that. "I guess I can continue
to work if I could do films other people want me to do. I don't know
if I can do that, though. What are the challenges -- for me to make a
summer blockbuster? Not interested," he says, throwing out a pairing
as anomalous as him and the tree. "Could I go back and try to do a
film that grosses $200 million, $300 million in the summer, a
beautifully made slick article? I wouldn't know where to begin." It
comes back to making personal films.</TE>
<TE>   Schrader, who is directing a potential blockbuster himself -- a
"prequel" to "The Exorcist" -- believes that Scorsese overstates the
case if he worries that his ability to make personal films is at
stake. "What is at stake is his ability to make high-budget personal
films at a leisurely pace," Schrader says. "He went back once before,
in 'After Hours,' proved that he can make a film on a budget.... He
can do that again. He doesn't want to and I don't blame him for that.
But he can."</TE>
<TE>   Scorsese does not really disagree. "Maybe I should give full rein
to what made me feel most comfortable," he says, which brings him
back to one more project inspired by the view out his window.</TE>
<TE>   The old neighborhood</TE>
<TE>   Last year, when Paul McCartney headlined a fundraiser at Madison
Square Garden for the Sept. 11 victims, a handful of filmmakers
identified with the city -- Scorsese, Woody Allen, Spike Lee and a
few others -- were asked to make shorts for the event. Scorsese's was
called "The Neighborhood" and started with an uncle's 1940 home movie
of a festival on Elizabeth Street. He also showed the real butcher
across the street from his window, who turned out to be the farthest
thing from Bill the Butcher. She was Mary the Butcher, a sweet lady,
then 97.</TE>
<TE>   "This is how it goes," Scorsese explains on his filmed tour of the
old neighborhood. "My grandparents were Sicilian. My parents became
Italian American. I think of myself as an American Italian. And I
suppose my children -- my children are American."</TE>
<TE>   It's that progression he wants to capture in a feature film
someday, particularly the sense of loss with the disappearance of the
older generations and their links to the old country. It's not a
boy's view of the streets that's preoccupied with the young toughs
and their fight for daily survival, but an older man's reflections on
the precarious survival of traditions.</TE>
<TE>   It's a theme with which almost any descendant of immigrants --
which means almost any American -- could identify. Scorsese already
has a draft of a script he worked up with Nicholas Pileggi, his
collaborator on "GoodFellas" and "Casino." They hope to go back to
1870s Sicily, but other than that, "you could do it cheaply,"
Scorsese points out. "It's mainly interiors."</TE>
<TE>   There even would be a short Queens section, presumably with a
family and its little boy almost getting stuck there, away from the
cobblestone and the stories that connected them to their past.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, that's in there," Scorsese says. "Yeah."</TE>

<TE>   Street smarts</TE>
<TE>   Martin Scorsese has returned repeatedly to the streets of New York
to explore how the city gives rise to such heightened passion --
violent, shadowy and intense. Here's a streetwise guide to his work,
with commentary from The Times' critics.</TE>
<TE>   After Hours (1985). Griffin Dunne spends the night stranded in
SoHo with neither cab fare nor subway token. "In his sweetly ominous
'After Hours,' " wrote Times critic Sheila Benson, "[Scorsese]
catalogs our fears. Then he shuffles them and deals a personal-size
comedy, so relentlessly exact that it's hilarious."</TE>
<TE>   Raging Bull (1980). The devolution of boxer Jake La Motta from the
streets of the Bronx to bloated dissolution. "An unrelenting, densely
textured, harshly honest and mesmerizing film," wrote Champlin, "and
an achievement likely to go unchallenged for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Taxi Driver (1976). That would be Travis Bickle, the Vietnam
veteran turned vigilante, and perhaps the most chilling creation of
Scorsese's New York. "The streets got meaner, a lot meaner in
Scorsese's nerve-scraping new film about the making, or more
accurately the triggering, of a psychotic killer," wrote Times arts
editor Charles Champlin.</TE>
<TE>   GoodFellas (1990). Ray Liotta grows up to be a wise guy with De
Niro and Joe Pesci -- and winds up in the witness relocation program.
"To see an artist working at the peak of his power, everything
extraneous stripped away, is an extraordinary exhilaration," said
Benson.</TE>
<TE>   The Age of Innocence (1993). Here the streets are the genteel
avenues of upper-class 1870s New York and tribal law the harsh
judgments of polite society. "The man who specialized in characters
who never suppressed an emotion," wrote Kenneth Turan, was not the
obvious choice "to take on a love story of almost agonizing
restraint. Scorsese impresses by how masterfully he comes up to the
challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Mean Streets (1973). A band of friends from the neighborhood on
the prowl in Little Italy. Times critic Kevin Thomas wrote that
"Scorsese's way with actors, words and images is nothing short of
prodigious. Harrowing, intense, grueling even, 'Mean Streets' is an
unqualified triumph."</TE>

<LD>It's the morning of the first day of class in "Lessons," the Season 7
opener of UPN's "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," and Buffy is about to
send little sister Dawn to high school. Somewhere between breakfast
cereal and backpack check, ("Books, lunch, stakes?"), Buffy hands
Dawn a small package tied with ribbon.</LD>
<LD>   "What is it?" Dawn asks. "It's a weapon, isn't it?"</LD>
<LD>   "Yes," Buffy says with a smile.</LD>
<TE>   The present, it turns out, is a cell phone, and it's become Dawn's
signature tool as Buffy passes the stake to the wireless generation.
In the Buffyverse, all things are meaningful -- and linked -- thus
the cell's become part of a never-ending riff.</TE>
<TE>   When Dawn is being chased by the ghosts of murdered nerds, she
dials Buffy ("Buffy? Isn't this reception amazing? I'm in the
freakin' basement!"). Six episodes later,that same cell phone becomes
a symbol of disconnect. Dawn is calling for help, but to no avail --
Buffy is lost in conversation with a vampire she's supposed to be
killing. While the vampire feels tapped into "an all-consuming evil,"
Buffy feels alone. "When you said not connected," says her undead
would-be shrink, "that was kind of a telling statement, wasn't it?"</TE>
<TE>   Like many a weapon (or tool) before it, this one's double-edged --
as anyone who's driven behind a cell-wielding SUV pilot knows.
Soulful or soul-robbing? As with the stake before it, that all
depends on how it's used.</TE>

<HD>Read her eyes</HD>
<DH>Soprano Andrea Rost has to revise her stage style in her
first feature film.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elaine Dutka</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hungarian-born lyric soprano Andrea Rost, currently starring in Los
Angeles Opera's "Tales of Hoffman," is a growing presence on the
international scene.</LD>
<LD>   Flexing different muscles, she can now be seen in her first
feature film: "Bank Ban," Csaba Kael's cinematic adaptation of her
homeland's most culturally significant opera. In the movie, which
just completed a Santa Monica run, she plays a 13th century lady in
waiting who becomes the object of sexual pursuit while her
viceroy-husband is on the battlefield.</LD>
<LD>   Was it a big adjustment, toning down your stage performance to
achieve a more naturalistic feel?</LD>
<TE>   On stage, you bring emotions into your whole body. In film, I
tried to bring all the emotions into my eyes so I wouldn't be over
the top. The director wanted an "inner life" rather than movement and
facial reactions. I had problems expressing myself in the first scene
-- you see in my face I was nervous. The advantage of movies is that
you can correct your mistakes. In opera, you can't say, "Whoops! I
want to sing that aria again."</TE>
<TE>   One critic, otherwise impressed with the movie, took issue with
the fact that the score was prerecorded -- a standard procedure, it
seems.</TE>
<TE>   We recorded the score two months before the shoot and sang to the
playback. Sometimes I just moved my lips or, in a close-up, sang an
octave lower, which is less intense. Singing the real notes wouldn't
look good on screen because so many little muscles in the face and
neck are working. Though the lip-syncing isn't always perfect, you
have to prerecord. You can't have an orchestra repeat things 10 or 20
times -- and the acoustics are terrible when you're shooting outside.</TE>
<TE>   Directors such as Zeffirelli, Bergman and Carlos Saura have
successfully transferred opera to the screen. But the conventional
wisdom is that it's tough to do well.</TE>
<TE>   It's not easy to make it believable because singing isn't normal
in film. Though characters don't speak, they have to narrate the
story -- and sometimes singers can't act. In [the 1953 film version
of ] "Aida," Renata Tebaldi sang while Sophia Loren played the part.
Maybe that's the way. It's very important to have a good face for the
screen.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the limitations, are film and video good for broadening
the opera audience, which is getting grayer every year?</TE>
<TE>   We should be making music videos for opera: setting arias to
certain images and getting stars, like Michael Jackson or Nicole
Kidman, to help tell the story. In my next record, we're including a
video clip with the Mozart arias, like they do with pop music. The
growth of DVDs should open up the video end because the sound on VHS
is so bad. Next year, I'm starring in Bellini's "La Sonnambula," a
mix of pop culture and opera in which two huge video screens show
images of sleepwalking and the subconscious onstage. It's important
to demonstrate that opera isn't just for old people and that opera
singers aren't just big and fat.</TE>
<TE>   Why isn't "Bank Ban," the movie, being distributed
internationally?</TE>
<TE>   It's a matter of politics. Though the previous government
supported the movie, this government does not. Like Shakespeare, the
characters stand for something larger than themselves. The piece is
seen as a protest against foreign invaders -- and, therefore,
anti-Communist. It only played one day in Hungary, which is very
frustrating for the cast and crew. From what I can tell, it's just a
reaction against the other side, which lost power during
postproduction. A kindergarten story, really.</TE>

<HD>'Granny Kam' Pounds Bad Luck to a Pulp</HD>
<DH>A Chinese ritual called 'beating up the wicked people' is
popular, but officials want to restrict it on environmental grounds.
They also hope to share it with tourists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helen Luk</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG</DL>
<LD>Squatting in front of a makeshift Chinese shrine adorned with incense
sticks and two statuettes, Leung Kam-ip, aka Granny Kam, gets ready
for business by lighting some candles and picking up her weapon, a
worn shoe.</LD>
<LD>   Without warning, the 78-year-old woman starts swearing and
swinging, pounding the shoe loud and hard on a white piece of paper
emblazoned with the image of somebody her customer hopes to jinx.
When she's done, she burns the paper.</LD>
<LD>   "Beat up the gossipmongers everywhere," she chants.</LD>
<TE>   Leung makes a living performing a traditional Chinese ritual
called "Da Siu Yan" -- literally, "beating up the wicked people."</TE>
<TE>   Having bad luck? Want to curse your enemies? For 50 Hong Kong
dollars, about $6.50 U.S., Granny Kam will come to the rescue.</TE>
<TE>   As Hong Kong's economic slump leaves many people struggling with
staggering unemployment and record numbers of bankruptcies, some are
seeking a bit of supernatural help to rid themselves of earthly
gloom.</TE>
<TE>   Leung performs her rituals near Times Square, one of Hong Kong's
glitziest malls, and a market abounding with glazed duck and
barbecued pork. But in this super-modern city, old customs such as
this one are bound to bump up against officialdom.</TE>
<TE>   Acting on complaints about sidewalks messy with the ashes of
burned paper, the government is looking to regulate the practice and
perhaps tap its tourist potential.</TE>
<TE>   Officials aren't proposing to ban it. "If we ban it, the custom
will be lost," said Suen Kai-cheong, a district councilor. Instead,
they are considering proposals to put the practitioners in booths or
install furnaces to replace the small metal buckets now used.</TE>
<TE>   The practitioners, usually elderly women, say the ritual can drive
away evil spirits in general or target a specific enemy.</TE>
<TE>   Limping about on swollen feet, Leung was busy one recent day
serving a dozen customers -- mostly women in their 20s and 30s.</TE>
<TE>   So So Ma, an insurance agent, said the beating up the wicked
ritual has soothed her anxieties and helped her clinch more business
deals.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel more at ease afterward," Ma said. "I'm hoping everything
will go smoothly and I'll have fewer obstacles."</TE>
<TE>   Sales worker Yoko Kwok, 29, hoped Leung could help reverse the
recent string of bad luck suffered by her British boyfriend, a Hong
Kong police officer.</TE>
<TE>   "He bought a cat and it died. His car crashed. He was transferred
to another position at work. You won't believe how unlucky he has
been!" Kwok said.</TE>
<TE>   After Leung stopped beating a piece of paper for Kwok's boyfriend,
she wrapped it inside a papier-mache yellow tiger.</TE>
<TE>   She pushed the tiger's mouth onto a lump of pork fat to feed it --
"bribing" the animal to keep its mouth shut. She threw in colorful
mock money and other paper offerings and set the whole thing ablaze.</TE>
<TE>   Then she pronounced the ritual a success.</TE>
<TE>   Experts think that the custom, widely practiced in southern China,
dates back at least to the 19th century and originated from women
worshipping white tigers.</TE>
<TE>   But whether tourists can be sold on "beating up the wicked"
remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Santi, a 53-year-old British businessman, stared long and
hard as Leung pounded away with her shoe, then burst into laughter
when told about the ritual.</TE>
<TE>   "If that works, the whole world is going to turn upside down,"
Santi said and walked away.</TE>

<HD>Afghan Judge in a Tangle Over Uncovered Hair</HD>
<DH>Female jurist switches jobs after Afghan media criticize
her for not wearing a chador in U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Valerie Reitman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>When Marzia Basel, one of Afghanistan's few female judges, recently
spent several weeks in the United States, she met with President
Bush, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other dignitaries to
appeal for more assistance for her homeland.</LD>
<LD>   Returning home, she was greeted by derogatory headlines and sneers
because, while in the U.S., she hadn't always worn her chador, the
scarf used by many Muslim women to cover their hair.</LD>
<LD>   The controversy began when Kabul's television station broadcast
footage of her and 13 other Afghan women in a vaunted U.S. State
Department international leadership-training program. The private
weekly Thubat, or Proof, criticized their behavior. "These women had
gone as modest women but dishonored the people of Afghanistan," the
paper wrote. "Afghan government officials made a big mistake sending
them to the U.S."</LD>
<TE>   Several publications reported that the Afghan government had fired
Basel, one of 32 female judges among several hundred jurists. A
senior court official dismissed that suggestion, and Basel herself
says she quit the judgeship, which pays $54 a month, to join UNICEF,
where she is building a juvenile-justice program.</TE>
<TE>   She said she's angry, hurt and depressed about the criticism and
fears for her safety. "I did a lot for my country there," she said.
"Today I want to cry, hearing these things."</TE>
<TE>   Basel blames the media, not the government, for creating the
furor. "Afghan media don't want to learn and be educated. If women
are strong and educated, it will be a problem for them."</TE>
<TE>   As for the chador, she says, "we are Muslims. It's good if we wear
it, but if we don't, it's all right. Lots of Muslim women don't wear
it."</TE>
<TE>   The chador issue has been a lightning rod for controversy
centering on the role of women in Afghan society. Unlike under the
Taliban, which forbade women from appearing outside without their
burkas, today there are no legal restrictions on what women can wear.
Still, social and religious dictates hold powerful sway.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of Afghan women still wear their burkas on the
street, fearing harassment from men if they do not. In recent weeks,
however, many have been pulling them back to expose their faces or
taking them off altogether. Those who don't wear burkas usually wear
a chador, which most keep on inside the workplace. Television
announcers have been ordered to wear them during broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Fazal Ahmad Manawi says
that, legally, women should have a choice about what to wear. "But
personally," he adds, "we advise our people to observe our culture
wherever they are."</TE>
<TE>   Safia Siddiqi, 38, president of planning and international
relations at the Ministry of Women's Affairs, never wore a chador
when she lived in Canada, where she spent several years as a refugee
before returning to Afghanistan recently. During a recent interview
at her office, she wore a skirt and blazer with a chador around her
head. "So many issues are more important than whether women wear a
chador," she said, citing security and health.</TE>
<TE>   "We've just gone through 23 years of problems, especially the last
six years under the Taliban," she says. "It's our idea that it's not
difficult to put a piece of cloth on your head. It's respectful and
at least we should wear it. If we remove it, it means the future is a
problem" for this society.</TE>
<TE>   Basel, too, wears the chador in Kabul. During a recent afternoon
interview at the office of the Women Justices Assn., black fishnet
stockings peeked out from beneath her long black wool skirt. Inside,
she let her black veil drop to her shoulders, but pulled it up when
she went outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   "While we're inside Afghanistan, we have to observe the customs of
Afghanistan," she said. "But not while I'm outside." She no longer
wears a burka, as she did when living under the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Basel, 35, is single -- unusual for women in Afghanistan, where
marriages are almost always arranged between families. She grew up in
a liberated family: Her father was a judge and her two sisters also
became attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Basel said she liked the "feeling of women in America," which she
got from the five weeks she spent traveling across the U.S. as part
of the State Department program. "They were really impressed with the
situation of women in Afghanistan. Some of them really cried with
us."</TE>
<TE>   While walking through Hollywood, an American woman proselytizing
on a street corner admonished a translator with the group that she
shouldn't be wearing such a short skirt. The proselytizer teasingly
turned to a man walking by and said, "Do you think women should wear
such short skirts?" The man jokingly retorted, "I like women wearing
nothing."</TE>
<TE>   All of them "laughed and laughed," recalled Basel, completely
defusing any tension.</TE>
<TE>   That's the way it should be, she says. "People should be free to
do what they want as long as they don't bother others."</TE>
<TE>   The Koran, she said, exhorts women to cover "their beautiful
parts, such as their breasts, hips and legs, but doesn't say they
should hide their faces or cover themselves with burkas."</TE>
<TE>   "Real Islam is not the Islam [they] are expressing," she said of
her critics. "It is such a great religion that gave women rights and
equality. But people are illiterate and they don't know what real
Islam is.</TE>
<TE>   "We have enough people remaining who are Taliban but have just
changed their faces."</TE>

<HD>Town's Treasure Is the Ground, Not the Gold Beneath</HD>
<DH>Farmers in Peru who want to maintain their way of life
object to Canadian firm's plan to extract a wealth of minerals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Craig Mauro</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>TAMBOGRANDE, Peru</DL>
<LD>Taking a break from running his parents' restaurant, Javier Palacios
strolls across the sleepy main square -- the spot that will become a
huge mining pit if a Canadian company gets its way.</LD>
<LD>   Lime and mango orchards sprawl in the hazy lowlands below the
town. Palacios, a 33-year-old engineer, nods toward them: "We've been
tied to agriculture for generations. We simply don't want the mine
and the change that it would bring."</LD>
<LD>   The farming community has been steadfast in fighting to keep the
mineral treasure beneath its land where it is -- and away from the
mining company.</LD>
<TE>   In the process, it has become a case study in the conflicts that
can arise from globalization, one in which powerful financial
interests seeking profits collide with the will of a town determined
to maintain its way of life.</TE>
<TE>   The tale includes an unsolved murder, riots and looting,
propaganda battles and a disputed referendum. The Roman Catholic
Church has weighed in with the mine's opponents, and the debate has
even touched ceviche, Peru's national seafood dish.</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan Minerals, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, began
exploring the area in 1997 and now believes that the soils contain
900,000 ounces of gold, 10 million ounces of silver, 1.5 billion
pounds of copper and 900 million pounds of zinc. At recent prices,
that's worth $1.6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The company has already invested at least $50 million and must
exercise its option on the project by May. It says the mine would
provide $200 million in taxes and royalties for Peru's government,
which would have a 25% stake in the mine.</TE>
<TE>   The company holds mining rights to 225,000 acres in four
"concession blocks," among them a 24,700-acre plot that includes
Tambogrande.</TE>
<TE>   Developing one ore deposit would mean clearing away most of the
town center and another would require diverting a river, Mayor
Alfredo Rengifo says. Foes say about half the 16,000 residents would
have to move.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not the displacement that upsets Tambogrande as much as
the belief that the mine's waste would pollute ground and surface
water, and destroy one of the most productive agricultural valleys in
Peru.</TE>
<TE>   There is also widespread suspicion that nearly all of the mine's
profits would end up abroad and with the national government in Lima,
Peru's capital more than 500 miles away, which historically has
neglected the provinces.</TE>
<TE>   Big mines are nothing new in Peru, Latin America's leading source
of gold and the world's fifth-largest copper producer. Minerals
account for half the country's exports, but the mines are usually in
sparsely populated areas high in the Andes.</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan Minerals executives in Peru and Canada did not respond
to requests for interviews, but the company's Web site says the
mine's environmental and social impact would be minimal. In
statements, company officials have promised to use cutting-edge
technology and follow strict safeguards.</TE>
<TE>   The company also says the mine's annual payroll, including
benefits, would be $6 million and equal the current income of all of
Tambogrande. The project would create up to 2,500 construction jobs
as well as 400 permanent jobs during the mine's lifetime, the company
says.</TE>
<TE>   For many townspeople, however, these benefits would not compensate
for what the mine would leave behind.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been to other mining communities, so they can't lie to me,"
said Rodrigo Zapata, a town clerk. "We know it's going to pollute the
land and water. In 20 years, it will put an end to the life we've
always lived."</TE>
<TE>   In a nonbinding referendum held by the municipality in June, 98.6%
of valid votes were against any kind of mining.</TE>
<TE>   Peru's cash-strapped government, which needs to lure foreign
investment, does not recognize the vote. Officials are urging
townspeople to consider the benefits of the mine in spurring economic
development and creating jobs in a region where most people live in
poverty.</TE>
<TE>   In February 2001, marchers trashed and burned Manhattan Minerals'
offices in town and wrecked several model homes of the kind the
company promises to build for uprooted families.</TE>
<TE>   "We may be ignorant, but we realize that agriculture is better for
us than mining," said Sebastian Marquez, a town councilman and mango
farmer.</TE>
<TE>   "Agriculture won the vote and it must be respected. If not, the
government is making a big mistake, because blood will flow. This is
not terrorism or subversion; it is a town demanding that its voice be
heard."</TE>
<TE>   A month after the riot, Godofredo Garcia, a farmer who had helped
lead opposition to the mine, was shot to death in his fields by two
hooded men. There have been no arrests.</TE>
<TE>   The archbishop in nearby Piura later spoke out against the mine
and urged peaceful demonstrations.</TE>
<TE>   There was not much of anything in this part of Peru's arid
northern coastal plain until the World Bank helped finance a big
irrigation project in the 1950s, turning the San Lorenzo Valley into
a fertile oasis.</TE>
<TE>   Today, motorcycle rickshaws and mule-drawn carts carry farmers
along dirt roads to fields of rice, marigold flowers and other
produce.</TE>
<TE>   According to one study, the valley produces 40% of Peru's limes
and mangos. Most of the latter are exported to the United States and
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   In February, Tambogrande activists dressed as limes marched
through downtown Lima warning that pollution from a mine would mean
an end to ceviche.</TE>
<TE>   The acidic juice from Peruvian limes marinates the dish's raw fish
and provides its signature taste.</TE>

<HD>Monaco Goes to Sea to Snare Tourists</HD>
<DH>Huge yachts and cruise ships can berth at the $328-million
floating breakwater. The project expands the rich principality's
harbor by 40%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joseph Coleman</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>MONACO</DL>
<LD>Monaco had a headache only a princedom could gripe about: Its
postcard-perfect harbor was too small to host huge yachts and cruise
liners.</LD>
<LD>   So the wealthy Riviera enclave came up with a princely solution --
a $328-million floating breakwater longer than a football field.</LD>
<LD>   The project may seem grandiose for a country smaller than New
York's Central Park. But this enclave of wealth, wedged between the
mountains and the Mediterranean, has been on a building craze for
half a century.</LD>
<TE>   Since Prince Rainier III assumed the throne in 1949, Monaco has
expanded its territory by 20% with land reclamation. It has built a
whole new port, an artificial beach, a sparkling culture center and
an underground railway station.</TE>
<TE>   The new breakwater is on par.</TE>
<TE>   Built by a consortium that includes Spain's Grupo Dragados of
Madrid, the dike complex -- put in place mostly in September -- will
do more than still the waters for the wealthy. It also will include
parking for 350 cars, rows of shops, ventilation and elevators.</TE>
<TE>   "We can be proud of the work being accomplished here," Rainier
said during a recent tour. "The new configuration of the port will
open up new paths to economic development for our country."</TE>
<TE>   The complex includes a 2 1/2-acre platform, a 145-yard jetty and a
new quay. The centerpiece is a 352-yard-long floating breakwater
constructed at a dry dock in Algeciras, Spain, and towed through the
Mediterranean in August.</TE>
<TE>   Grupo Dragados says the breakwater is the largest in the world not
grounded into the seabed. With water in the port more than 165 feet
deep, the floating dike will be anchored to the sea floor with
cables.</TE>
<TE>   The project adds 15 acres of harbor to Monaco's pristine 40-acre
port, an addition of nearly 40%, and is designed to last 100 years,
Grupo Dragados says.</TE>
<TE>   Monaco officials say the project is both economical and
environmentally sound.</TE>
<TE>   The princedom has little choice but to reach to the sea. Nestled
on a steep, stony hillside in southeastern France not far from Italy,
the tiny country is blanketed by high-rises, elegant mansions, hotels
and restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   "The aim is to make Monaco one of the largest harbors for leisure
boats," said Rene Bouchet, an engineer with the Department of Public
Works.</TE>
<TE>   If there's anywhere that yachts and cruise liners should berth,
it's Monaco.</TE>
<TE>   The tiny territory doesn't publish much economic information, but
its gross domestic product is estimated by the U.S. government and
others at $870 million -- about $27,000 for each of its 32,000
residents. That's among the highest per capita figures in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Monaco has always been a magnet for wealth. Its almost nonexistent
income taxes and secretive banking system create a haven for people
with money, while the luxurious Monte Carlo casino and clubs give
them plenty to spend it on.</TE>
<TE>   The territory has seen its fair share of celebrity. The late
American actress Grace Kelly made history when she gave up a
Hollywood career to marry Rainier in 1956.</TE>
<TE>   Today, stars like former Swedish tennis great Bjorn Borg reap the
benefits of the princedom's tax policies. And every spring, the
streets of the principality are turned into a raceway for the Monte
Carlo Grand Prix.</TE>
<TE>   Rainier has overseen a diversification into finance, cosmetics,
pharmaceuticals and high-tech industries. But tourists are still a
major moneymaker, and the government is always looking for ways to
attract more.</TE>
<TE>   The harbor project has overcome several obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   Foremost was an engineering problem: how to build a dike in water
so deep. Monaco is so proud of the floating breakwater design --
based on techniques used in offshore oil rigs -- that the
principality has a patent on it.</TE>
<TE>   David Lopez, who runs Grupo Dragados' Monaco operations, said
other technical challenges included making the dike impermeable and
ensuring that it was strong enough to last a century while light
enough to float.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about a structure of 175,000 tons," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the draft plans for the project were even more elaborate
than what was eventually built. For example, some in Monaco wanted to
build residential high-rises on the breakwater, but that was deemed
infeasible.</TE>
<TE>   Studies for the complex began in 1985, but arranging contracts and
financing kept work from starting until 1999. It is expected to be
finished in 2007.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are still squabbling about the price. Grupo Dragados
originally bid about $52.2 million for the floating breakwater, but
now is asking $151 million. The two sides are negotiating.</TE>
<TE>   "The work we constructed ... is not the same work that had been
initially designed," Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Monegasques are busy dreaming up the next
big-ticket item. The latest proposal is to build a full-size model of
Venice on an island of reclaimed land in the bay and connect it to
the mainland with a bridge.</TE>
<TE>   Bouchet, the public works engineer, is all for it.</TE>
<TE>   "From the point of view of technology, it is not utopian," he
said.</TE>

<HD>World's Most Populous Nation Takes Steps to Stop Suicide</HD>
<DH>China's first research and prevention center has opened in
Beijing with a goal of changing outdated attitudes about mental
health.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ted Anthony</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>One day this month, three nurses will sit down at telephones in
Beijing and do something that would have been unheard of in China
just a decade ago: They'll try to stop anyone who calls from
committing suicide.</LD>
<LD>   As 1.3 billion people cope with the most sweeping changes their
nation has ever experienced, China's first suicide research and
prevention center is opening in the capital with a lengthy list of
priorities -- everything from intervening in emergencies to changing
outdated attitudes about mental health.</LD>
<LD>   It's a tall order for a populace accustomed to centuries of
gritting their teeth through hard times and coping with "chiku" -- a
traditional metaphor for enduring hardship that means, literally,
"eating bitter."</LD>
<TE>   "The changing culture and society have given us an opening," said
Dr. Michael R. Phillips, executive director of the new Beijing
Suicide Research and Prevention Center and a physician in China for
18 years.</TE>
<TE>   "There's such rapid social change that people are willing to think
about things they haven't thought about before," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The center employs 11 doctors and 13 nurses, most of them Chinese.
It will offer a range of services, from the toll-free hot line, to
counseling and crisis intervention, to comprehensive research --
already under way -- on suicide and attitudes toward it.</TE>
<TE>   But doctors see an entirely non-clinical development as the most
significant sign of changing attitudes: The center is at a public
facility, Huilongguan Hospital, and is being funded quite willingly
by Beijing's city government.</TE>
<TE>   "Suicide and depression, they're definitely something that goes
hand in hand with our fast development," said Zhang Jianshu, an
official at the Beijing Bureau of Health, which contributed $242,000.
"As China develops, we have to pay more attention to this kind of
health issue."</TE>
<TE>   Long before Deng Xiaoping's reforms began two decades ago, suicide
was a problem for China -- particularly among rural women plagued for
generations by abuse, unrewarding lives and feelings of deep
hopelessness.</TE>
<TE>   These days, convulsive change is stirring things up even more.
Financial upheaval -- a common contributor to suicide -- is rolling
across the land as the opening of once-stable markets to foreign
investment reconfigures the economy and puts millions out of work.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is no standard reporting system for deaths in
China, researchers using available figures extrapolate that 287,000
Chinese kill themselves each year, making suicide the No. 5 cause of
death in the world's most populous country. Some 2 million Chinese
try to kill themselves annually.</TE>
<TE>   Even more alarming to researchers: Suicide is the No. 1 cause of
death for Chinese ages 15 to 34, and women have a 25% higher rate
than men. In addition, rural suicide rates are three times as high as
urban rates.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, this is one of modern China's most important issues,"
said Dr. Liang Hong, the center's clinical services director and head
of the China end of the International Depression Project, a research
consortium with fellow developing nations India and Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   "Older people don't know much about mental health. People in the
countryside, they have no idea they can get help," she said. "People
in China don't think this is something to see a doctor about."</TE>
<TE>   Although the center is new, its physicians have been doing
research on suicide for years.</TE>
<TE>   Their latest paper, on why and how Chinese kill themselves, was
compiled from scores of interviews with suicide victims' families and
is being published in the British medical journal Lancet.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond helping people directly, the center hopes to serve as a
model -- first for Beijing's 500 hospitals and eventually for the
rest of the country.</TE>
<TE>   It is surveying 50 top hospitals in the capital to determine how
they can start anti-suicide programs and train doctors.</TE>
<TE>   The most high-profile part of the center will undoubtedly be its
hot line, advertised in newspapers, on television and over
loudspeakers at major sporting events. Three celebrity spokespeople
-- including Dashan, a Canadian comedian renowned in China -- will be
endorsing it as well.</TE>
<TE>   For a country that had no psychiatric hospital until 1898, it's a
major step -- and, if word does get out, a beacon of hope for
millions of Beijing residents who never knew that they had anyone to
turn to when times got tough.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just starting. Our knowledge will grow with each call,"
said An Fengming, one of 20 mental-health staffers who will answer
the hot line 24 hours a day. "I want to help people in their hearts."</TE>

<HD>Pipeline Plan Has Foes Up in Arms</HD>
<DH>Coal company needs a new water supply for its mines on two
Indian reservations. Environmentalists and tribes voice opposition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Berry</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Peabody Energy, the world's largest private coal company, needs a new
water supply for its mining operations on the Navajo and Hopi
reservations in northern Arizona. But a company proposal to drill
shafts into the Grand Canyon to tap the Colorado River is drawing
fire.</LD>
<LD>   "It's just totally unacceptable. The Grand Canyon is one of our
sacred places," said Geoff Barnard, president of the Grand Canyon
Trust, a Flagstaff-based preservation group. "The Grand Canyon
National Park's intent and purpose would be violated by a project
like this."</LD>
<LD>   "It would scar the land and pollute the canyon," added Kelvin Long
of the Black Mesa Water Coalition, another group opposed to the
canyon pipeline. "We're fighting to stop it."</LD>
<TE>   The proposal calls for building a $125-million pumping station and
pipeline within the national park. It would require drilling
1,200-foot shafts through the canyon rim.</TE>
<TE>   Peabody spokeswoman Beth Sutton said the company has not committed
to the plan yet, describing it as "an option that we're looking at.
But we are continuing to look at other options. We want to resolve
this issue in a way that will benefit all parties."</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis-based Peabody has been operating the Black Mesa mine on
the reservations since 1970, leasing coal and water rights from the
two tribes in return for more than $2 billion so far in royalty
payments and other benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Peabody, which also operates a coal mine in Kayenta, Ariz., buys
about 3,800 acre-feet of aquifer water from the two tribes each year
for nearly $4 million.</TE>
<TE>   The groundwater is used in a 173-mile slurry pipeline that carries
more than 13 million tons of low-sulfur coal to the Mohave Generating
Station near Laughlin, Nev., and the Navajo Generating Station near
Page, Ariz. The two plants supply power to about 1.5 million
customers in Arizona, California and Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   The pipeline also supplies free potable water to the tribal
communities from the aquifer beneath the reservations.</TE>
<TE>   But the Hopis, worried that the aquifer's long-term supply could
be strained by the region's expanding population, have set a 2005
deadline for Peabody to stop using that groundwater and look for an
alternative source.</TE>
<TE>   That led to a plan that was being pushed recently by Sen. Jon Kyl
(R-Ariz.) to lease 6,500-acre feet of Colorado River water annually
for Peabody's mining operation and set the stage for the canyon
project.</TE>
<TE>   The related legislation didn't come to a vote.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Kyl nor Hopi officials returned calls seeking comment on
the proposed project.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley Pollack, water rights counsel for the Navajo Nation, said:
"All of the parties agree that finding an alternative water supply
for the slurry line is necessary to ensure the long-term viability of
Mohave and the Black Mesa mine. We're investigating other
alternatives, including brackish water aquifers."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed pipeline would begin at a diversion point on the
river from Jackass Canyon, a popular hiking spot about eight miles
downstream from Lees Ferry. It would wind along the Navajo
reservation to Black Mesa on the Hopi reservation.</TE>
<TE>   The Sierra Club has joined other environmental groups in
denouncing the project, saying it would be an eyesore for rafters,
hikers and fishermen using that portion of the canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Long said his group is against any additional pipelines.</TE>
<TE>   "The one Peabody has now has broken nine times in the last year,"
he said. "There are chemicals in it and they seep into the ground. It
kills livestock and vegetation."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona Department of Environmental Quality officials said coal
slurry is not considered toxic but can damage watersheds and threaten
wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Barnard said there are viable alternatives that Peabody should
consider, such as recycling the slurry water via a parallel pipeline
or building a rail system to get the coal to the power plant.</TE>
<TE>   "Building a rail would be cost-prohibitive and difficult to
construct due to the terrain," Sutton said. "The most viable option
to transport coal would be continuing to use a pipeline."</TE>
<TE>   The Mohave power plant wants to negotiate an extension of its
coal-supply agreement for another 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, environmentalists are bracing for battle should a
water-leasing bill for Peabody come before Capitol Hill lawmakers in
the next session.</TE>
<TE>   "What we want to do is work closely with Sen. Kyl's office -- and
Sen. [John] McCain's office -- and find a satisfactory solution,"
Barnard said. "A pipeline in the Grand Canyon is not the way to go."</TE>

<HD>The Art of Conversation Is Percolating at Cafes</HD>
<DH>Born in Seattle, the concept has spread as strangers gather
to discuss issues ranging from safe streets to war with Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Melanthia Mitchell</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Strangers are doing something radical in Seattle. They're talking to
each other.</LD>
<LD>   The concept of meeting someone new and talking about issues of
common importance, gradually smothered by urban life, has been reborn
through Conversation Cafes. Signs on coffeehouse tables and open
invitations to talk draw lawyers, housewives, even the homeless, to
discuss anything from safe streets to war in Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Although simple, the Seattle-born movement has taken off quickly
since its start last year.</LD>
<TE>   Conversation Cafes are now percolating worldwide, from California,
Kentucky and Florida to Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom. The
salons have become a forum for small groups of people to meet on a
weekly or monthly basis and discuss meaningful issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever two people engage in conversation, it not only impacts
the individuals ... the people change society," said Vicki Robin, who
came up with the idea for the chattercafes.</TE>
<TE>   Robin, co-author of "Your Money or Your Life," a guide to living
better by spending less, developed the idea for conversation forums
four years ago in a bid to expand the book's ideas of personal
transformation.</TE>
<TE>   She originally thought that the format for public discussion
should be a radio show, but that never got off the ground. Then there
was a TV program that never happened. Finally, after brainstorming
with friends, Robin settled on the idea of free-form salons, to be
held at neighborhood cafes and coffee shops.</TE>
<TE>   Cafes seemed the most logical location because anyone would be
allowed to join the conversation and, she said, "there's more chance
of diversity."</TE>
<TE>   Robin said people too often close themselves off, not willing to
trust the unknown, and surround themselves with like-minded people.
She said they never challenge themselves to really think about even
the most minute of issues.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so many reasons why it's very dangerous for people to
discover each other," Robin said. "There's so much power that comes
out of open dialogue."</TE>
<TE>   Intent on creating a network for people interested in
self-reflection and desiring cultural change, Robin pioneered her
conversation initiatives on July 5, 2001, at the Grateful Bread
deli-bakery, near her home in north Seattle's Wedgewood neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The core group of people who attended the meetings eventually
became the co-creators for the processes and agreements that now
define the discussions.</TE>
<TE>   The rules: Listen with respect and without judgment, honor
diversity of opinion, speak about what is personally meaningful with
honesty and depth, and inquire before advocating.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'This is so simple and small scale, I should be able
to do this,' " Robin said.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "As I watched the debate unfold, I realized that we needed
cultural dialogue," Robin said. "We needed to be able to learn our
way through this. We needed to unite as a nation."</TE>
<TE>   Motivated by the tragedy, she began fostering more Conversation
Cafes, with the movement climaxing in January, when there were 24
cafes throughout the Puget Sound area.</TE>
<TE>   Robin also organized Conversation Week, featuring several days of
conversation events. The second annual weeklong event is scheduled to
kick off in Seattle on Jan. 26 at the Elliott Bay Bookstore Cafe.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Robin has trained 60 cafe hosts, with about 17 ongoing cafe
conversations throughout Seattle and at least half a dozen other
locations, including Missoula, Mont.; York, Pa., and Carmel, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, host Joe Leeak held a Conversation Cafe at Nana's Soup
House in Wedgewood, Wash. After setting the ground rules, he and the
three other men sitting at the table introduce themselves and talk
briefly about why they're there.</TE>
<TE>   "I just came for a little hit of cafe conversation energy," said
Lloyd Sieden, a regular at the meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Discussion is a mixed dialogue on how safe people feel and common
cultural myths. Talk ebbs and flows between personal safety -- both
nationally and globally -- myths surrounding genetically engineered
food, and eventually ends on cars and transportation.</TE>
<TE>   "It always amazes me where you start and where you end up," Leeak
said after the 90-minute meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Like most, Leeak enjoys the energy that emanates from cafe
conversations. He said he's also looking "for the chance to get a
reality check on things."</TE>
<TE>   "I get value out of knowing whether other people's experiences are
similar to mine," Leeak said.</TE>
<TE>   It's that connection and sense of community that Robin said makes
people return each week.</TE>
<TE>   "People get up from the table with a renewed faith in their fellow
human beings," she said. "I think people yearn for good conversation.
They yearn to be heard."</TE>

<HD>Indians Dreaming of Water for Their Suffering Soil</HD>
<DH>Arizona tribe's name means 'River People,' and farming was
the basis for its culture before white settlers came. Plan may help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Pauline Arrillaga</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>SACATON, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>If he closes his eyes and shuts out the miles of fallow fields that
yield only brush and shriveled mesquite, Harlan Bohnee can still see
when this valley thrived.</LD>
<LD>   Neat rows of cotton camouflaged the desert, painting the dusty
earth an emerald green. Peach trees and wild spinach sprouted outside
his boyhood home, in the shadow of mountains covered with cactus.</LD>
<LD>   Families like his lived off the land, and the land obliged with a
bounty that sustained the cultural and economic existence of a
community whose very name means "River People." His ancestors settled
there because of the life-giving waters that flowed freely into
hand-dug aqueducts.</LD>
<TE>   "That was the basis for our culture -- the river," said the
66-year-old farmer, who learned the trade from his father, who
learned from his father. "If you don't have water, you don't have
anything. You're not even living."</TE>
<TE>   If you ask Bohnee, the Gila River Indian Community hasn't really
been alive for years.</TE>
<TE>   Its watershed, like those traversing so many of the nation's
Indian reservations, was drained after white settlers headed West and
began pumping the river for their own use. Farmland went barren.
Irrigation canals dried up and became littered with weeds and trash.
Self-sufficiency eroded with the shrinking river as the tribe grew
more reliant on government commodities.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Bohnee is one of only a handful of farmers on the
370,000-acre reservation, which sits south of Phoenix along swelling
suburbs whose golf courses and houses serve as the Indians'
competitors for water.</TE>
<TE>   But now he sees promise in the neglected soil that spans his
homeland.</TE>
<TE>   One proposal would guarantee the community of 17,000 Indians about
2.1 billion gallons of water each year -- enough to serve roughly 3
million people -- and give the tribe $200 million in federal money to
rebuild its dilapidated irrigation system.</TE>
<TE>   The deal is one of dozens of Indian water settlements in
negotiation over the last 25 years as Western states, the federal
government, farmers, industries and tribes seek to sort out who
should get how much of the region's most precious resource.
Congressional action would be required.</TE>
<TE>   The Gila River proposal, among the largest in terms of how much
water would be awarded, comes as the battle for liquid gold reaches
new heights in the West. With severe drought draining rivers and
reservoirs, some towns ran dry this summer while neighbors waged war
over century-old water rights.</TE>
<TE>   For non-Indians, the settlements mean certainty about how much
water they're due in wet times or dry. For the tribes, they carry the
prospect of economic development and, for some, a return to
traditional agricultural practices.</TE>
<TE>   They also bring newfound bargaining power to a group that has
always had little.</TE>
<TE>   "These water settlements are the treaties of this century, the way
the land settlements were the treaties of last century," said Daniel
McCool, director of the University of Utah's American West Center who
has written several books on Indian water settlements. "They are
critically important and will have profound consequences for Indian
country for all future generations to come."</TE>
<TE>   White settlers saw the West's streams and rivers as their sole
domain and dug canals to irrigate arid pastures. They also developed
a new legal system to delineate water rights: Whoever first diverted
and used the water had the right to that resource over all subsequent
claimants.</TE>
<TE>   But their doctrine of "prior appropriation," meant to serve the
miners, ranchers and farmers who became the prevailing political
forces in the West, faced an unlikely challenge from their old
adversaries.</TE>
<TE>   In 1905, a Justice Department attorney in Montana filed suit on
behalf of the Ft. Belknap Indian Reservation, seeking water for a
proposed irrigation project. He argued that when the U.S. established
the reservation, it implicitly reserved the right to enough water to
sustain the land.</TE>
<TE>   Although the position was contrary to prior appropriation, a judge
agreed. Three years later, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   But these victories rarely resulted in actual water for the
reservations because few had any modern delivery systems or the money
to construct them. With their land held in trust by the government,
Indians couldn't obtain bank loans to build irrigation canals, and
Congress was slow to fork over cash.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, tribes began asserting their water rights in court --
sometimes suing independently, sometimes intervening in cases brought
by states or non-Indians. A few early settlements were reached in the
1960s, but once again, promises of water delivery went unfilled. By
the late 1970s, court rulings turned less favorable for the tribes,
including one giving state courts the authority to resolve claims.</TE>
<TE>   With leaders concerned about the impact of Indian claims on future
development and tribes worried that they couldn't win in court, the
federal government began calling on all sides to negotiate.</TE>
<TE>   In 1978, the 750-member Ak-Chin Indian tribe, just south of the
Gila River reservation, became the first Indian community to settle
its claims under the federal negotiating process.</TE>
<TE>   Approved by Congress in 1984, the settlement mandated delivery of
75,000 acre-feet of water annually to the reservation beginning in
1988. It also allowed the community to lease another 10,000 acre-feet
annually to provide water for a development north of Phoenix. (One
acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons, enough to cover an acre of land
with a foot of water.)</TE>
<TE>   Tribal member Leona Kakar began fighting for the deal in the
1960s, when she and her brothers came up with the idea of starting a
farm to sustain the community. Before water arrived, the Ak-Chin
farmed just 3,000 acres. They now grow 15,000 acres of wheat, barley
and cotton.</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen settlements have been approved since. Twenty more remain
in negotiation, and other tribes await their chance to bargain.</TE>
<TE>   Not every tribe wants the water for farming. Some seek to protect
streams and species they consider sacred. Others have use for the
water and intend to lease it back to non-Indian users, something
opponents fear will result in a high-stakes bidding war. In return
for the settlement, tribes agree to waive all future claims to their
federal reserved water rights.</TE>
<TE>   But the process is hardly without strife. Settlements involve
nearly every significant watershed in the West and thousands of
users. Some negotiations last for decades -- the Gila River case
began in 1974 -- and are fraught with some of the same underlying
attitudes that plagued early white-Indian relations.</TE>
<TE>   Even those who support the settlements don't agree with the
rationale behind them.</TE>
<TE>   "It just seems unfair ... like their rules are always different
than our rules," said Arizona cotton farmer Dan Thelander, who would
surrender some water rights under the proposed Gila River settlement.
In exchange, farmers would be exempt from paying millions in
water-related debts and have the opportunity to buy other water at a
cut rate.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to get water when they weren't using it before and
everybody else had to use it. They got the casinos, and nobody else
can have casinos," he said. "Philosophically, I don't really think
that they deserve it. But the reality is that it's too good a deal to
pass up."</TE>
<TE>   That's what the Gila River Indians are counting on. The community
is fast at work building irrigation canals that leaders hope will one
day carry water to now-fallow fields. The ultimate goal is to raise
146,000 acres of cotton, wheat, alfalfa and vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   "People say, 'Why do you want a water settlement when all this is
desert?' Well, it wasn't this way," Bohnee said. "It's basically dead
right now. It needs to be brought back to life."</TE>
<TE>   Now when Bohnee surveys his homeland, he no longer dwells in the
past. He can finally envision a future.</TE>

<HD>School Is Helping Youngsters Rope Rodeo Dreams</HD>
<DH>Year-old arena and training site are center of activity in
Navajo town. Many aim to bull their way into New Mexico university
program.</DH>

<AU>RICHARD BENKE</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>CRYSTAL, N.M.</DL>
<LD>Rodeo's another word for life in Crystal, where kids have been known
to start riding bulls at age 12.</LD>
<LD>   The trading post is long gone, and the "Crystal Red" Navajo rugs
made from hand-carded wool dyed with pigment from the nearby red
mesas may be harder to find.</LD>
<LD>   But rodeo is growing. A new rodeo arena and rodeo school, finished
about a year ago, are the center of activity in this Navajo
reservation community, population 347, some 60 miles north of Gallup.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just like in the city -- they're nuts about Little League,
where out here rodeo is the No. 1 sport," said Eugene Crawford,
general manager of the arena and co-founder of the James Hunt Jr.
Rodeo School.</TE>
<TE>   The buzz here is that college is suddenly the way to go now that
the University of New Mexico has a rodeo program that carried
competitors into regional and national collegiate finals in its
second year.</TE>
<TE>   Steer wrestler Brandon Bates represented the university in the
nationals, and Lobo mentor Flavian Tabaha, a Crystal native, was
named coach of the year for the National Intercollegiate Rodeo
Assn.'s Grand Canyon region.</TE>
<TE>   "Flavian was fortunate to take his kids to the nationals,"
Crawford said. "A lot of kids in this area, from what I hear, want to
move to the University of New Mexico college team. They've got more
of a chance to make it to the top.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a dream for some of these kids," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Tabaha started riding bulls when he was 12 and now, in his 40s,
helps young men and women learn the art.</TE>
<TE>   "I always put out that I'm a dreamer. Always things will happen if
you have a dream," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Preferably, a dream they can get their rope around. Tabaha helps
the students define and refine it.</TE>
<TE>   "Education is the priority, and rodeo comes second because if they
do it the other way around, they can't do either one," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He also keeps parents involved to make sure that team members stay
on track, said Dave Stromei, father of university barrel racer Tasa
Stromei, 21, a junior majoring in psychology, who has entered 10
pro-circuit rodeos.</TE>
<TE>   "Flavian is a very good coach," said Stromei, who rode collegiate
rodeo himself at New Mexico State.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been great," agreed junior team roper Leon Pioche. "He's
given us the opportunity to rodeo with all the other cowboys. He
guides us."</TE>
<TE>   Pioche knows that it's a longshot but also would like to try the
pros "if I get that good."</TE>
<TE>   "So far, the rewards are being a part of the team, for the
school," said Pioche, team president.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the academic push, Pioche said he has a 2.4 grade
point average, majoring in economics.</TE>
<TE>   The university program brought senior Tolo Martinez of Capulin
back to rodeo. He said he had quit five years ago. Now he has
regained his enthusiasm for the sport and sees a future for it in
Albuquerque.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm excited for it, just because this is a good place for rodeo,"
he said. "I love this city because it is so diverse, and I think it
will help UNM with its diversity. We have everything else. We might
as well add rodeo."</TE>
<TE>   Usually 12-year-olds stick to junior bulls, Crawford said, but
acknowledges that he rode broncs when he was 12.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the lifestyle of these kids," he said.</TE>
<TE>   They start at 5, competing in junior rodeos riding sheep instead
of cattle. By the time the rodeo school at Crystal gets hold of them,
they're in high school, often with years of rodeo experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been rodeoing since I was 10," said Lindsey Ezell of Belen,
another Lobo team member. She said she has been riding horses since
she was 4 or 5 and hopes to become a veterinarian.</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of our lives," the 20-year-old added.</TE>
<TE>   Tabaha came home to Crystal for a recent fund-raising rodeo and
barbecue at the home of his sister, a tribal judge, to help kick off
the Lobos' third season. The team gets no university money, and there
are no rodeo facilities at the university; sponsors and fund-raising
events pay for travel, equipment and other necessities.</TE>
<TE>   The seven-member university team includes three women and four
men, Anglo, Latino and different Native American tribes -- all
anxious to improve on last year and looking for big prize money down
the road.</TE>
<TE>   Top professional rodeo contestants can earn $10,000 a weekend, but
reality can take an 80% bite, or more, out of that kind of dream,
Tabaha warns. Costs can be a shock when winnings don't materialize.</TE>
<TE>   "You pretty much have to have a big-time sponsor," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After catching the dream, Tabaha helps the team work toward it.
This year, that means victories in the national finals.</TE>
<TE>   "We set our goals and just focus on it and eventually things will
happen," he said.</TE>

<HD>Logging Debate Heats Up in Wake of Wildfires</HD>
<DH>Timber firms want to avoid wasting valuable wood. But
critics argue that shelter for animals can be threatened, and erosion
can occur.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gillian Flaccus</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>SISTERS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>From a rocky ridge deep in Deschutes National Forest, the landscape
unfolds below Forest Service Ranger Bill Anthony like a surreal
moonscape.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of thousands of charred and naked trees stretch into the
distance, their dead roots clinging to the ashy soil.</LD>
<LD>   Just three months ago, these trees were part of a towering forest
of ponderosa pine and Douglas fir that rolled over the eastern slopes
of the Cascade Range. That was before a lightning storm started the
Eyerly Fire, which consumed 24,000 acres in three weeks.</LD>
<TE>   "It's in a very bad state right now," said Anthony, who oversees
the Sisters Ranger District in central Oregon. "We need to get the
hillsides stabilized."</TE>
<TE>   The Eyerly Fire and dozens like it nationwide have cooled, but a
passionate debate among environmentalists, the Forest Service and
timber industry over the remaining trees is heating up.</TE>
<TE>   For years, timber companies and environmentalists have been at
odds over logging after wildfires: Where the Sierra Club sees fragile
and damaged forests, the timber industry sees valuable wood going to
waste.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer's dramatic wildfire season coupled with President
Bush's recent forest-thinning proposal bring an urgency to the
question of post-fire logging that has top-level Forest Service
officials and environmentalists battling.</TE>
<TE>   The question will not go away soon. Years of fire suppression on
national forests have left unnaturally dense forests that are more
prone to fire than ever before.</TE>
<TE>   At stake are about 1.64 billion board feet of timber -- enough to
build nearly 140,000 three-bedroom homes -- that have or will be
logged from federal forests after the 2000 and 2001 wildfire seasons.
Numbers from the 2002 season are not yet available. A board foot is a
slab a foot long and wide and an inch thick.</TE>
<TE>   To environmentalists, such post-fire logging is a recipe for
disaster. They say it causes irreparable erosion that ruins
fish-bearing streams, while removing dead wood that provides critical
shelter for animals.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the habitat value for these trees happens after they
die," said Jeff Juel, ecosystem defense director at the Ecology
Center in Missoula, Mont. "The whole idea of calling something
salvage implies that it's something that would otherwise be wasted.
Well, nature doesn't waste anything."</TE>
<TE>   Such groups frequently use the courts to block post-fire salvage
sales, citing scientific studies to challenge the Forest Service's
logging projects.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups challenged about 48% of post-fire timber
sales proposed in 13 Western states in 2000-01, according to an
Associated Press survey of appealable sales in the agency's six
Western regions. Data on post-fire timber sales is not kept centrally
by the Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups have successfully blocked 6% of those sales
and delayed another 6% until the uncut trees lost their commercial
value and were rejected by timber companies, according to the survey.</TE>
<TE>   One scientific study in particular, the Beschta Report, has been
the bane of the Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists have used the report, prepared in 1995 by Oregon
State University forestry professor Robert Beschta, to challenge six
sales and won in four of those cases.</TE>
<TE>   In a June 12 speech before the House Resources forestry
subcommittee, Forest Service chief Dale Bosworth lashed out at the
report and what he called the resulting "analysis paralysis" within
the agency.</TE>
<TE>   "Hitting .333 is very good in baseball," he said, referring to the
percentage of timber sales that survived challenges from the Beschta
Report. "It's not much of an average in natural resource case law."</TE>
<TE>   The timber industry angrily questions the environmentalists'
studies and says good lumber is going to waste while logging moves to
other countries, where there is little environmental regulation.</TE>
<TE>   "They're disgusted with the time that it takes and the waste of a
public resource that could be turned into consumer products that we
use every day. Instead, it's left to rot on the stump," said Chris
West, vice president of the American Forest Resource Council.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, timber companies have sued the Forest Service after
delayed sales, saying the agency violated its contract, West said.</TE>
<TE>   Foresters, caught in the middle, say they now spend more time on
legal paperwork for each sale than they do in the field.</TE>
<TE>   "We constantly have to rely on our legal counsels in Portland to
make sure we're checking all the right places," said Paul Hart,
spokesman for the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest in central
Washington. "If someone doesn't want that project to proceed, they
can question everything in there."</TE>
<TE>   The truth is somewhere in the middle, said Jack Ward Thomas,
Forest Service chief under President Clinton and now a conservation
professor at the University of Montana at Missoula.</TE>
<TE>   "It's complicated and there are no simple answers," Ward said.
"Sometimes salvage doesn't make a ... lick of sense -- either
ecological or economic sense -- and sometimes it makes enormous
sense. We ought to quit arguing about this in its generality."</TE>
<TE>   Even some environmental groups agree post-fire logging that thins
out the smaller trees and leaves big trees standing has ecological
value. But the small trees have little commercial value and don't
attract any bidders, the groups say, forcing the Forest Service to
include more valuable trees.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service insists that it only proposes post-fire logging
in areas where it makes sense -- where dead trees could spread beetle
infestation, scorched stands need to be thinned or fallen trees could
create heavy fuel for future wildfires.</TE>
<TE>   If the agency can get some commercial value from those projects,
that's an added bonus, they say.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, restoration work, such as reseeding to prevent
erosion, is funded by revenue from post-fire timber projects, said
Anthony, the ranger from the Sisters District.</TE>
<TE>   On the site of the Eyerly Fire, for example, Anthony will propose
anywhere from 4 million to 30 million board feet of post-fire salvage
logging.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the logging will cut scorched trees that slant dangerously
over frequently used Forest Service roads. The rest will focus on
areas where burned patches could nurture destructive beetles that
could spread into healthy forests where northern spotted owls thrive,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony also hopes that any sales will help pay for $1.1 million
in post-fire restoration work on the fire site that probably won't be
funded by Congress.</TE>
<TE>   But Anthony is certain that post-fire logging plans on the Eyerly
Fire will be appealed by environmentalists -- or even be the target
of a lawsuit from frustrated timber companies.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of discussion about why we would do this knowing
we're probably going to wind up in appeals or possibly in
litigation," he said. "We feel we need to take a responsible look at
it and see if we're defensible from every perspective."</TE>

<HD>Nevada Town Fights for Water, Way of Life</HD>
<DH>Sandy Valley fears it could dry up like Owens Valley if a
developer wins the right to divert some of its liquid assets. Dispute
is in court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Angie Wagner</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>SANDY VALLEY, Nev.</DL>
<LD>It's almost as if you need to get lost to get here, to dusty streets
and aging trailer homes, to horses and ranches -- to an escape from
somewhere else.</LD>
<LD>   Residents who managed to find this rural speck on the map are
friendly but keep to themselves -- individualists, but a community
all the same.</LD>
<LD>   "Please drive carefully. Old Horses. Blind dogs. Unruly kids,"
reads a sign on the way into town.</LD>
<TE>   Almost unnoticed, a big company slipped inside their tranquillity,
looking for something it thought the 2,275 residents could spare.
Vidler Water Co. wanted to give a little of Sandy Valley's water to
another community.</TE>
<TE>   A little or a lot, folks here didn't much care. They weren't
sharing.</TE>
<TE>   "They probably thought we were a bunch of country bumpkins," said
resident Joy Hyde Fiore. "They so underestimated our passion for our
way of life."</TE>
<TE>   So began the fight between a company with a job to do and a tiny
town whose future residents believe is in doubt.</TE>
<TE>   The prelude to the battle comes on the way into town, along a
dusty, two-lane mountain road few visitors travel. "Water! Save Our
Future" blares the roadside sign.</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Valley is an unusual community that lies in two states and
three counties. The California-Nevada line runs right through town,
although most people live on the Nevada side, in Clark County.
California's Inyo County is to the west, San Bernardino to the south.</TE>
<TE>   It's 40 miles southwest of Las Vegas, but it's a world away from
its glitzy neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   Bighorn sheep roam the land, the mountains dwarf the cars on the
highway and trailers house most of the residents.</TE>
<TE>   Residents like life the way it is, even if it means driving about
15 miles to the nearest gas station.</TE>
<TE>   So Vidler's request to take some water got people organized, and
now the self-described "water warriors" have a lawyer and an appeal
pending.</TE>
<TE>   It started in August 1999 when Vidler quietly asked Nevada State
Engineer Hugh Ricci for 2,000 acre-feet of water from an aquifer that
runs beneath Sandy Valley. (An acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons,
enough to supply two average-sized households for a year.)</TE>
<TE>   No one in Sandy Valley knew about the request.</TE>
<TE>   Vidler, a water resource development company and a subsidiary of
La Jolla-based PICO Holdings, was trying to obtain extra water for
nearby Primm, an Interstate 15 freeway stop where the Primm family
wants to build housing for casino workers and expand an outlet mall.</TE>
<TE>   Vidler later decided that it wanted only 1,400 acre-feet and by
July 2000, residents had noticed Vidler nosing around their wells.</TE>
<TE>   Residents started talking and the Sandy / Mesquite Valley
Development Assn. switched from organizing Easter egg hunts and
Halloween parties to fighting the request. The "water warriors" held
bake sales, raffles and cook-offs to raise money to hire an attorney,
and they became water experts.</TE>
<TE>   Signs went up around town, newsletters urged residents to be
vigilant, and letters went to state legislators and the media with
the headline: "Take my water, take my life."</TE>
<TE>   About two dozen residents showed up at a December 2001 hearing
before the state engineer. They argued that taking any water would
prevent future growth in Sandy Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Sandy Valley water shouldn't have to support another
community, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to protect our own water for our own existence,"
said John Bacher, who along with his wife, Beth, is helping lead the
water war.</TE>
<TE>   Ricci told them that based on U.S. Geological Survey data from
1968, the area has 2,200 acre-feet that can be taken away each year
without harming the water supply.</TE>
<TE>   He decided that Sandy Valley has enough water for the future, too,
based on a population estimate of 5,000 residents by 2020.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Ricci granted Vidler a permit for 415 acre-feet a year,
meaning that Vidler can draw 135 million gallons.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Vidler nor Sandy Valley was happy, and they both appealed
the next month in Clark County District Court in Las Vegas. Vidler
wanted more; Sandy Valley didn't want the company to have any.</TE>
<TE>   Residents argued that Ricci didn't take into account how much
water the California counties use. Ricci agreed, saying he has
jurisdiction only over Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such a small amount of water, but it's everything to them,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows that better than the residents of the four
communities that make up Owens Valley, Calif., some 175 miles
northwest of here. A growing and thirsty Los Angeles tapped the Owens
River for water in 1910 for an aqueduct built three years later.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers already had diverted much of the water but Los Angeles
sealed its fate; the river gradually dried up along with many of the
community's prospects.</TE>
<TE>   That's the story that Sandy Valley fears could become its own.</TE>
<TE>   "The long-distance export of water from anywhere takes away that
portion of that community's future," said Mike Prather, president of
the Owens Valley Committee, a citizen oversight group.</TE>
<TE>   "Water is everything in the West. We lost our future that way."</TE>
<TE>   Vidler tried to compromise with Sandy Valley, even offering money
if residents would drop their protests. If Vidler was given 1,400
acre-feet, it would have paid Sandy Valley $140,000 to hire an expert
and deepen wells if it were proved that taking water away lowered the
water supply. Even if there was no effect after 10 years, Sandy
Valley could keep the money for community improvements.</TE>
<TE>   "We just didn't get anywhere," said Dorothy Timian-Palmer, Vidler
chief operating officer. "They have closed the door to every approach
we made to them."</TE>
<TE>   That money would make a huge difference in a community with no
full-size supermarket and where most roads aren't paved, but
residents said it would be costly to prove water loss and didn't want
the money anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "They really thought they could buy us," Fiore said. "They ran
into a community that money is not as important to them as their
lifestyle."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Saturday, residents swirled cotton candy on sticks,
offered drippy snow cones and bailed each other out of a makeshift
jail at the Wild West Roundup, the town's latest fund-raiser. They
sold recipes for jackrabbit stew and "I'm Appealing" T-shirts, while
a hair stylist gave $8 cuts in the sun and the smell of horse manure
competed with the barbecue grill.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our way of life," resident Dawn Haviland, a justice of
the peace in nearby Goodsprings, said before heading to the rodeo.</TE>
<TE>   Residents fear that Vidler's request is just the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like opening the floodgate," said resident Elaine Clark, 60.</TE>
<TE>   Already, three other companies have requested Sandy Valley water
to build power plants in the area. Ricci has not ruled on those.
Residents figure that a planned regional airport nearby also could
invite water requests.</TE>
<TE>   It could be years before the water war is settled, but both Vidler
and Sandy Valley say they'll continue the fight.</TE>
<TE>   "Sandy Valley is a wonderful place to live," said Fiore, 64. "If
we overdraw this basin, our property will be worth nothing. How do
you start over?"</TE>

<HD>Hardy Aloe Uproots Cotton, Sugar as Texas Staple</HD>
<DH>The Rio Grande Valley grows 95% of the U.S. crop, which has
medicinal benefits. It can be processed into juice and shampoo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lynn Brezosky</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>HARLINGEN, Texas</DL>
<LD>Something about the aloe plant evokes the image of a gifted child who
needs little coaxing to do well.</LD>
<LD>   It takes root under perverse conditions -- hot, dry weather
preferred. Its healing powers are said to give soothing comfort to
everything from burns to ulcers. It can be processed into juice,
capsule or shampoo.</LD>
<LD>   And a growing world market is looking to Harlingen for its aloe
fix.</LD>
<TE>   With little tending, the crop is turning a more steady profit than
old mainstays such as cotton and sugar ever could.</TE>
<TE>   An acre yields 5,000 to 7,000 pounds monthly. Growers net about 10
cents per pound, or $500 to $700 for each acre harvested. That's four
times the average for cotton and grain and on a par with sugar cane,
which is more expensive to grow.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 2,000 acres of aloe vera being harvested in the
Rio Grande Valley -- 95% of the aloe grown in the United States. From
the expressway linking the region's small cities, neat rows of the
pointy plant are a curious break from a landscape of prickly pear and
mesquite.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, you see them as a small-statured houseplant," said
Robert Lonard, a University of Texas-Pan American biologist who
specializes in Rio Grande Valley flora. "Here, they're more
spectacular because they grow right outside."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, not intentionally, Lonard said with a laugh as he
remembered how he once threw his aloe plants on the compost pile only
to have the aloe root there.</TE>
<TE>   Aloe planted decades ago now grows waist-high in front of
boarded-up homes in a former retirement community.</TE>
<TE>   Just about every family has an aloe vera anecdote.</TE>
<TE>   In his own childhood, Harlingen Mayor Connie de la Garza recalls,
the ooze inside the long, waxy leaves was also the answer to
everything from scrapes to sour stomachs.</TE>
<TE>   "When we were kids growing up, ... we used to get a cut, someone
would run out to slice a piece," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The aloe is a succulent, with leaves that can hold water for long
periods. Too much water can rot the plant, and it would take the most
severe drought to dry it out. That makes it ideal for the valley,
which gets little rainfall but is irrigated by the Rio Grande.</TE>
<TE>   The plant's only other enemy is cold, which rules out the crop for
most areas to the north and west, where nighttime temperatures fall
during winter.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, a rare freeze wiped out the valley's citrus crop and
devastated roadside palm trees. It also killed the aloe.</TE>
<TE>   Aloe is believed to have originated in Africa and has been traded
through the ancient world as far as India and the Far East. The
Sumerians are thought to have used aloe as a laxative, the Greeks to
stop hair loss. The Roman physician Pliny the Elder recommended it as
an antiperspirant. The Bible mentions the plant as part of the
mixture used to embalm Jesus Christ.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Cold War-era scientists found it effective in
treating radiation burns. Japanese researchers have reported
anti-tumor agents, and doctors in India have told diabetics to ingest
it to lower glucose levels.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish conquistadors and missionaries brought the plant with them
to the new world, and the popularity of the hardy plant quickly
spread throughout Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Curanderos, the folk healers who occupy storefronts throughout
South Texas' steamy downtowns, still peddle a host of aloe vera
treatments that have been handed down through the centuries.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to pinpoint, extract or mimic the plant's "miracle"
properties, researchers have concluded that it's a combination of
elements, including amino acids; sterols, which act like cortisone to
combat inflammation, and salicylic acid, an aspirin-like compound.
Its stickiness helps bind wounds.</TE>
<TE>   Aloe is a member of the lily family, as are garlic, onions and
asparagus.</TE>
<TE>   Split a leaf and you'll find little tubules clinging to the outer
rind, from which comes a sticky liquid that has been isolated for
medicinal uses. The "inner fillet" -- the gelatinous inner membrane
-- is processed for cosmetic uses, such as lotions or shampoos.</TE>
<TE>   Polysaccharides, which work with the immune system, may be the
most important elements for healing. They're sometimes used to treat
cancer in house cats.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the 200-plus constituents working synergistically
together," said Gene Hane of the International Aloe Science Council.
"Aloe vera does so many tremendous things, it's kind of hard to see
where the benefits begin and end."</TE>
<TE>   As manager of Harlingen's Aloe Laboratories, a $2-million factory
opened last year by the Japanese-owned Harmony Green Inc., Luis
Rodriguez's goal is to process large quantities of the plant without
destroying its purported healing powers.</TE>
<TE>   During a recent tour, he showed how field workers cut the mature
leaves by hand -- there's no good way to do it mechanically -- then
fill crates that are driven to the factory a few miles away.</TE>
<TE>   From there, he said, the skins are removed from the fillets, which
are pasteurized and processed into juices, capsules and gels.
Warehouse shelves are laden with products packed for export
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. retailers are just catching on to the demand for aloe juices
or tonics.</TE>
<TE>   And although Americans have embraced the plant as a topical
treatment for sunburn and chafed skin, in other parts of the world,
it is as likely to be consumed internally to guard against everything
from ulcers to AIDS. In the Caribbean, it is acknowledged as the
bona-fide topical remedy for children who suck their thumbs.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, a Mexico-born chemist, swears by the plant's powers.
Whether in the fields or the factory, he has taken to drinking the
juice -- much as the Japanese do. And he is first to experiment with
new aloe products.</TE>
<TE>   "If you ask me when was I last sick, I'd say I don't know," he
said. "Ten years ... not even a small cold."</TE>

<HD>Ben Franklin's Bequest Helps Students Pay for College</HD>
<DH>The Founding Father's philanthropy funded specific projects
at first. Now some of the money is used for college scholarships.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Lewerenz</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>WILLIAMSPORT, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Craig Mark is studying toolmaking technology at the Pennsylvania
College of Technology, learning the trade of his father and his
father's father. And he's getting a little help from a Founding
Father too.</LD>
<LD>   Mark is one of 10 Penn College students receiving a scholarship
funded with money that Benjamin Franklin left in his will to benefit
Philadelphia and Pennsylvania. Franklin's small bequest has grown to
millions of dollars and is being used to support scholarships,
symphonies and projects in Boston as well.</LD>
<LD>   In his will, the printer, philosopher and Founding Father set
aside 2,000 pounds sterling to be used toward making Pennsylvania's
Schuylkill River navigable. But, in a codicil, he gave 1,000 pounds
sterling to the cities of Boston, his birthplace, and Philadelphia,
his adopted home.</LD>
<TE>   "I wish to be useful even after my death, if possible, in forming
and advancing other young men, that may be serviceable to their
country in both these towns," wrote Franklin, who died in 1790.</TE>
<TE>   But Franklin wasn't about to leave his philanthropy to chance. For
the first 100 years after his death, the money was to be used to make
low-interest loans to young tradesmen getting their start in
business.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin knew that his bequest would grow over the years, so he
stipulated that after 100 years, about one-fourth should continue to
be used to make loans, while the remainder could be used for public
works. That money helped create the Franklin Institute of
Philadelphia, an educational center and museum, and the Franklin
Institute of Boston, a technical school now known as the Benjamin
Franklin Institute of Technology.</TE>
<TE>   And Franklin wasn't done there. He estimated that after 200 years,
his bequest would be worth millions in each city. At that point, the
total was again divided, allowing Philadelphia and Boston to keep
about one-fourth of the total, with the rest going to their
respective states -- and any restrictions on how the money could be
used were removed.</TE>
<TE>   In Massachusetts, that money has continued to support the Benjamin
Franklin Institute of Technology. In Pennsylvania, then-Gov. Robert
P. Casey signed a bill in 1990 dividing the state's share -- about
$1.7 million -- between the Franklin Institute and Harrisburg-based
Community Foundations for Pennsylvania, which then divided its share
among the state's various community foundations.</TE>
<TE>   Some foundations have devoted their grants to things that Franklin
had supported in his lifetime, such as firefighting -- with the
Chester County Community Foundation's $1,300 grant to the Po-Mar-Lin
Fire Co. Other grants have supported women's health and disabled
children.</TE>
<TE>   The Williamsport-Lycoming Foundation, serving north-central
Pennsylvania, received an initial grant of $64,000, which it decided
to use for scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though, in a sense, these funds were unrestricted, Ben
Franklin's suggestion that it be used to support young artificers
served as sort of a clue for us," said Kimberley Pittman-Schulz,
Williamsport-Lycoming Foundation president. "That's where we came up
with the idea of funding some technical-education scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea was, what in our community would come closest to helping
young tradespeople get started? And we really looked with the
relationship with our area's technical college."</TE>
<TE>   To be eligible for the scholarship, students must come from the
area served by the foundation and be a graduate of a tech-prep or
vocational-technical high school program.</TE>
<TE>   That was perfect for Tanya Budman of Allenwood, a scholarship
recipient and freshman in the college's heavy construction equipment
technology program.</TE>
<TE>   "I always liked to tinker with things as a kid, taking them apart
and putting them back together," Budman said. "Growing up on a farm,
there were always things to tinker with."</TE>
<TE>   When she graduates, Budman hopes to get a job operating heavy
equipment on construction sites.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin could not have foreseen the massive diesel machines that
Budman hopes to operate. Still, said John Alviti, senior curator of
collections at the Franklin Institute, "he would have approved."</TE>
<TE>   "A tradesman is what he was, what he apprenticed as, where he made
his money initially and what his great wealth was based on," Alviti
said. "He felt something was owed to that field, and that's why he
sponsored that type of apprenticeship for those exercising a skill or
craft."</TE>
<TE>   It was not uncommon in Franklin's day for the well-to-do to leave
large charitable bequests, and Franklin's was nowhere near the
largest in Philadelphia's history. What was uncommon, Alviti said,
was the way the bequest was structured, with specific requirements at
first, then an openness to new ideas over time.</TE>
<TE>   That, Pittman-Schulz said, was what made creating the scholarships
so rewarding.</TE>
<TE>   "Very few organizations have the opportunity to manage money left
by one of the country's founders," she said. "And for us in the
community foundation field, it's also an example to our donors of
what, if you set aside some philanthropy now, can really happen in
the future."</TE>

<HD>Miners Defy Danger, Rush to Aid Co-Workers</HD>
<DH>They live by a perilous creed: When disaster strikes, you

<SE>Second in a weekly serial.</SE>

<DL>BROOKWOOD, Ala.</DL>
<LD>THE STORY SO FAR</LD>
<LD>   Half a mile underground, Tony Key trod down a tunnel, flecks of
coal dust blowing in his face. He was looking for a telephone to
alert mine inspectors that a house-size section of roof had just
caved in. Key knew that this was a particularly gassy mine and that a
battery charger -- its electric arc a potential ignition source --
might still be running on the other side of the cave-in. A tremor of
worry passed through him.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   BROOKWOOD, Ala. -- Tony Key heard the explosion before he felt it.
He half-turned to look but found himself hurtling through the air.</TE>
<TE>   He bounced several times on his side before coming to rest 50 feet
away, half-buried in a pile of dirt and coal. Disoriented and blinded
by the swirl of coal dust, his headlamp blown from his head, he
thought at first that he might be dead.</TE>
<TE>   As he clawed his way out of the rubble, he reached for the
self-rescue apparatus in a tube on his belt. In the darkness, he
fumbled with the mouthpiece and activated the airbag designed to
convert carbon monoxide into breathable oxygen.</TE>
<TE>   Key was terrified. He was usually mellow and unexcitable, speaking
only in slow, measured tones, but he'd never been through anything
like this.</TE>
<TE>   It was 5:15 p.m. on Sunday, Sept. 23, 2001. Less than a minute had
passed since the roof fall in Four Section of the No. 5 mine, but it
had been time enough for a pocket of gas to escape, reach the
electric arc of the battery charger and ignite.</TE>
<TE>   A few yards from Key, Michael McIe staggered to his feet with the
vague feeling that he was on fire. He remembered the mantra his young
daughter recited from school: Stop, drop and roll. That's what he
did, rolling about in the dark and patting himself frantically.</TE>
<TE>   McIe heard moaning. He hollered for his friend, Gaston Adams Jr.,
the third man who had been working on the roof with them. McIe
dragged himself toward Adams' headlamp, the only one still working.
He could barely make it out, the dust was so thick.</TE>
<TE>   McIe found his friend on the ground, surrounded by chunks of
concrete blasted from the nearby wall. "I can't move," Adams said.</TE>
<TE>   For a moment, McIe thought about carrying Adams, who at 240 pounds
outweighed his would-be rescuer by 70. But fearful that Adams might
have a broken back, he discarded the idea. Adams gave him his light
to go for help.</TE>
<TE>   With Key clinging to his work belt, McIe headed down the tunnel in
the direction of the section entrance, several hundred yards away,
holding the light high so they could follow a cable running overhead.</TE>
<TE>   A short way down the tunnel, they stumbled into Skip Palmer,
nicknamed Brutus, who'd been ferrying materials to Four Section on a
motorized rail cart. Palmer was just picking himself off the ground.</TE>
<TE>   The three of them got in the cart and rode until they could ride
no farther. Across the tracks, pipes from Four Section's ventilation
system lay in a useless heap.</TE>
<TE>   Closer to the source of the blast, the force of the explosion had
shattered concrete walls, another part of the ventilation system that
carried good air into the mine and bad air, laden with methane, out.</TE>
<TE>   Any methane seeping into Four Section now had no way to get out.</TE>
<TE>   Key skirted the wreckage of the ventilation pipes and made his way
down the tunnel on foot, looking for a phone that he knew was
somewhere just outside the section entrance. By now, three other
miners working nearby had made their way up the passageway to
investigate.</TE>
<TE>   Key and two of the men climbed into a six-passenger "manbus" that
was still running and made it to the phone. One of his companions
told him that the phone wasn't working; he'd already tried it. But
Key frantically punched its black emergency page button again and
again. Finally, he got through to the mine's control room, which sits
on the surface next to the mine's elevator shaft.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been an explosion," Key said. "We need lots of help. Mine
rescue, helicopters, ambulances, everything."</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-two men were scattered throughout the vast Jim Walter
Resources No. 5 mine that evening. As emergency telephones bleated
out instructions, the men began moving through the vast complex of
caverns and tunnels.</TE>
<TE>   Had they scrambled to the surface, only Adams, too injured to make
it out, would have perished. But that is not what they did. Like the
New York City police and firefighters who, just days before, had
rushed to the World Trade Center towers, the miners raced not from
danger but toward it.</TE>
<TE>   Miners know what underground fires and gas explosions can do; the
annals of mining abound with tragic examples. In Monogah, W.Va., in
1907, 362 miners died in the worst mining accident in the nation's
history; in Farmington, W.Va., in 1968, 78 perished; in Oven Fork,
Ky., in 1976, 26 miners and inspectors were killed.</TE>
<TE>   But miners have a creed: When trouble happens, you save your
brothers. You also save your livelihood. You save the mine.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After Key made his call, he realized how much his back was
bothering him. His companions told him to lie down on the floor of
the tunnel, then went back to confer with the others.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, McIe and Palmer emerged from Four Section on a rail cart.
They picked up Key and started toward the mine entrance.</TE>
<TE>   Through the gloom, they saw a light in the distance. It was a
manbus carrying six men who had come from two miles away. Twenty or
30 minutes after the explosion, the first help had arrived.</TE>
<TE>   McIe, in pain from three cracked ribs, recognized Bit Boyd, an old
fishing buddy and a shear operator on the long wall. Boyd, 38, was
one of several men who had been vocal recently about gas problems in
the mine.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd and the five men with him were shocked at how bad McIe,
Palmer and Key looked. Key was barely recognizable, his hair was
standing straight up and his face completely blackened. McIe was
holding a rag to his head, stanching a cut on his forehead. Palmer
appeared to be in shock.</TE>
<TE>   McIe and Palmer clambered into the back seat of the manbus. The
rescuers helped Key lie down in front. A man was designated to bring
them out.</TE>
<TE>   "Get the hell out of here," Boyd told them.</TE>
<TE>   Before heading off in the direction of the mine entrance, Key
warned the rescuers that with the ventilation system in ruins and the
battery possibly on fire, Four Section might explode again.</TE>
<TE>   As the injured men headed down the tracks, Boyd and his four
remaining companions headed the other way, toward Four Section.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Blevins, the foreman in charge of the shift that evening, was
near the elevator shaft when he first got word of trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Several hours earlier, he had just sat down for lunch. Wanda, his
wife of 36 years, had spent the morning cooking all his favorite
foods: chicken and dumplings, green beans, mashed potatoes, cole slaw
and blackberry cobbler.</TE>
<TE>   "Why I decided to cook it all that day, I have no idea," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Blevins normally had Sundays off, but he was scheduled to go on
vacation in a week, and his company wanted him at work. The foreman
was popular with the men for his attention to safety and for his
fairness. Once, after criticizing a worker in front of others, he
gathered the 100 men working the shift so that he could publicly
apologize. Many men would sign up to work only his shift.</TE>
<TE>   Wanda worried about her husband, although he'd never been hurt in
34 years underground. He had taken her down once, back in West
Virginia where they used to live. She got so scared, she cried.</TE>
<TE>   As he headed out the door, Wanda Blevins told him that she'd wait
up. He gave her a kiss on the cheek and jumped into his truck.</TE>
<TE>   He'd been at work a little over an hour when he heard about the
trouble in Four Section, 3 1/2 miles east. He hopped on a manbus and
headed that way.</TE>
<TE>   Just ahead of Blevins, 2 1/2 miles west of the roof fall, Ricky
Rose and two other "belt crew" workers were busy repairing a section
of the mine's conveyer belt. A phone near them began sounding an
urgent page.</TE>
<TE>   It was the control room, Rose said, alerting them that there had
been an "ignition" of gas in Four Section and asking them to go help
put it out.</TE>
<TE>   Ignitions are fairly common and usually no cause for alarm, but it
is paramount to jump on them quickly before they race out of control.</TE>
<TE>   According to Rose, the control room made no mention of an
explosion. Rose and several other miners say this was the first of
several conflicting stories that the control room relayed.</TE>
<TE>   Harry House, control room operator that day, surveyed an array of
instruments that monitored activity underground. However, it is
unclear how much information he had in the crucial hour after the
explosion. House has not responded to requests for an interview but
has told federal investigators that he consistently informed miners
that there had been an explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to the order from the control room, Rose's group
mounted a rail cart and headed toward Four Section. A short distance
down the track, they flagged down their boss and four other belt crew
workers to explain where they were heading.</TE>
<TE>   Were they absolutely sure? a supervisor asked. They needed to fix
the belt in time for the next shift.</TE>
<TE>   House was insistent, they explained.</TE>
<TE>   Rose and his two companions rode on in silence, winding their way
through the mine tunnels, until one of them suddenly spoke up.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a bad feeling about this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Why were they going to fight a fire that was half an hour away? By
the time they got there, it would either be out or burning out of
control.</TE>
<TE>   A second miner agreed. They should be heading for the surface, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in the front of the cart, Rose listened in silence. He was
a gruff, chain-smoking, Harley-Davidson aficionado. Usually nothing
scared him.</TE>
<TE>   But quietly he started to pray.</TE>
<TE>   Should Four Section explode again, fire and debris would have
nowhere to go but straight at them through the tunnels.</TE>
<TE>   The rescuers were going down the barrel of a gun.</TE>
<TE>   Next week: A powerful explosion and a fireball in the tunnels.</TE>

<TE>   How This Story Was Reported</TE>
<TE>   The story of the accident at Jim Walter Resources No. 5 mine is
based on interviews with eight miners who survived; another
half-dozen current or former employees of the No. 5 mine; relatives
of five miners who died; two members of the Alabama state mine rescue
team; members of the United Mine Workers of America safety committees
at several Alabama mines; UMWA safety director Joe Main; UMWA health
and safety representative Tom Wilson; Jim Walter Resources spokesmen
in Brookwood, Ala., and Tampa, Fla.; Assistant Secretary of Labor
David Lauriski; federal Mine Safety and Health Administration
spokesman Rodney Brown; and mining-industry experts. It also drew on
depositions given to MSHA during its investigation of the accident
and on six years of federal safety citations against Jim Walter
Resources No. 5, which were obtained from MSHA under the Freedom of
Information Act.</TE>

<HD>DNA Sets La. Prisoner Free After 16 Years</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>A man who served 16 years of a life sentence for rape was released
from prison Friday after a second DNA test showed he didn't commit
the crime.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel great," Gene Bibbins said at a news conference. "After 16
years, I feel good. In time, everything will be OK. I just knew one
day, if I got the right people behind me, I'd get out."</LD>
<LD>   The conviction of Gene Bibbins remains in place because the test
results are classified as preliminary. Once they are official, the
conviction can be reversed.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, he is free on $5,000 bond.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ready to get some sleep," Bibbins said before being whisked
off to dinner with his lawyers, supporters and family.</TE>
<TE>   Results of two DNA tests indicate that Bibbins is not the man who
climbed through the bedroom window of a 13-year-old girl in 1986 and
raped her while holding a knife to her throat.</TE>
<TE>   The victim's testimony and Bibbins' possession of a radio from her
room were key pieces of evidence used to convict him of aggravated
rape.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Sue Bernie said her office would not oppose Bibbins'
release.</TE>
<TE>   Bibbins is the first person set free under a new Louisiana law
that gives prisoners greater access to DNA testing to prove their
innocence. Inmates were given four years to request testing.</TE>
<TE>   "He has now been vindicated by tests by two laboratories," said
Vanessa Potkin, staff attorney for the Innocence Project in New York,
a group that seeks to free wrongly convicted inmates. The group
assisted Bibbins in getting the DNA testing.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to get a phone call today from a legislator, offering to
put a bill forward to give Gene Bibbins compensation," said Emily
Bolton, director of the New Orleans Innocence Project. Louisiana has
no program to compensate people wrongly convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Bibbins said he never lost hope and felt no antagonism against
anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the future, he said, "I'm going to take it easy right
now. I'm not in a big rush."</TE>

<HD>Officer Wears Scars as a Badge of Courage</HD>
<DH>Support from family, friends and strangers help badly
burned Jason Schechterle rebuild his life. He can drive, work and
hold his new son.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Pauline Arrillaga</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>An Associated Press series in June told how a police officer
struggled to survive after a fiery patrol car crash burned away his
face. This story details how he has since reclaimed his life.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   PHOENIX -- On a sunny November morning, the officer grabs his
briefcase and a carton filled with family photographs and climbs out
of a pickup in the parking lot of police headquarters.</LD>
<TE>   Clipped to his pants is a sparkling new badge. The old one, still
smudged with soot, is displayed at home. Strung from his neck is a
current photo ID. It replaces the one he no longer resembles.</TE>
<TE>   As he strides inside, the officer wears the grin of a kid on the
first day of school -- nervous anticipation infused with a childlike
optimism that anything is possible.</TE>
<TE>   He knows that better than most.</TE>
<TE>   He has met President Bush, carried the Olympic torch and thrown
out the first pitch at a major league baseball game, but a
once-routine act -- getting dressed in the morning and driving to
work -- he calls his "ultimate accomplishment."</TE>
<TE>   It is just one of many achievements for Phoenix Police Officer
Jason Schechterle since a car explosion last year left him horribly
disfigured and struggling to rediscover his identity -- and his life.</TE>
<TE>   Schechterle was responding to an emergency call on March 26, 2001,
when a cab driver suffered an epileptic seizure and slammed his
vehicle into the back of the police cruiser, which erupted in a
fireball. Schechterle was trapped for several minutes before
firefighters and police could rescue him.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze seared his hands, arms and legs but took direct aim at
his head and face, which sustained fourth-degree burns. Surgeons at
the Arizona Burn Center cut away all of the dead tissue to save his
life.</TE>
<TE>   The officer was stripped of his entire face -- ears, eyelids,
eyebrows and all but a stump of nose.</TE>
<TE>   In the year and a half since, Schechterle has continued to defy
the odds and exceed expectations with his physical and emotional
progress.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, he embarked on a series of operations to repair some
of his injuries. Schechterle began driving again in November and
returned to work a week later. He now juggles his job and many public
appearances, sharing his story with schoolchildren, burn victims and
officers.</TE>
<TE>   His happiest milestone came Oct. 29 when Masen, a 7-pound, 3-ounce
baby boy, was born to him and his wife, Suzie.</TE>
<TE>   "Going through this, he's realized what the important things in
life are," said Dr. Kevin Foster, co-director of the Arizona Burn
Center. "He just decided he's going to be a normal human being again.
And he has never looked back."</TE>
<TE>   Normal for Schechterle means busy:</TE>
<TE>   He's up at 6, out the door by 7, puts in an eight-hour day at the
office and meets with his physical or speech therapists five times a
week.</TE>
<TE>   At home, while Suzie cooks dinner, he takes care of Masen,
balancing a bottle in his mangled right hand. He instructs his
8-year-old stepdaughter, Kiley, to do her homework and plays
disciplinarian to 4-year-old Zane.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like a husband and father again," said Schechterle, who
marvels at the similarities between Masen and his oldest son, who so
closely resembles what Dad used to look like.</TE>
<TE>   For Schechterle, Masen is the ultimate testament to how far he has
come -- but also to the relationship between him and his wife, and
the devotion that inspired his recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "Suzie and Masen together," he said, "make me feel as if nothing
ever happened."</TE>
<TE>   His confidence has also been bolstered by an outpouring of support
from friends and strangers alike. After the Associated Press
narrative earlier this year that chronicled his accident and his
fight to recover, Schechterle received thousands of cards, letters
and e-mails from throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   One included a homemade rosary, another a $1,000 check in a card
simply signed, "From an old granny." A 13-year-old boy sent him a
hand-drawn picture of his face, colored like an American flag.</TE>
<TE>   When Schechterle first arrived home after the accident, Suzie fed
him, bathed him, brushed his teeth, got him dressed. Now he does just
about everything himself, although he still can't manage buttons or
shoelaces with hands left severely deformed by the fire.</TE>
<TE>   He also put some weight back on, going from 132 pounds in the
hospital to 166. Although he is still 25 pounds shy of his
pre-accident weight, Schechterle insisted: "I feel very healthy and
very strong."</TE>
<TE>   He couldn't make the same claim earlier this year, when he
underwent 11 different operations in five months to help reconstruct
his neck, mouth, hands and eyes. He's up to a total of 33 surgeries.</TE>
<TE>   In May, he traveled to Virginia to meet with Robert Barron, a
former CIA disguise expert who now makes custom prostheses for those
maimed by accidents, disease and defects.</TE>
<TE>   Barron molded two silicone ears and a nose. With liquid adhesive,
Suzie can attach the parts in minutes, giving new life to a face
devoid of distinguishing features.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to look whole again, more natural," Barron said.</TE>
<TE>   Schechterle next consulted a plastic surgeon who works with Barron
to improve the mobility in his neck and mouth, which were restricted
by thick scars.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Dr. Craig Dufresne inserted four silicone balloons into
Jason's chest and back to stretch the uninjured skin so that it could
be redistributed to replace the scar tissue around his neck. Every
week for almost two months, doctors injected each balloon with up to
3 ounces of saline to make them swell.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like when a woman becomes pregnant," Dufresne said. "The
expanding fetus also expands the muscle and the skin. When the baby's
delivered, the tissue doesn't always go back to the way it was."</TE>
<TE>   As Schechterle put it: "I looked like the hunchback of Notre
Dame."</TE>
<TE>   The procedure was not without complications. In July, during
Schechterle's first police ride-along since the accident, his former
partner, Bryan Chapman, noticed blood on his shirt and rushed him to
the Arizona Burn Center. Blood from raw tissue was seeping through
his sutures.</TE>
<TE>   In early September, Dufresne removed the implants, sliced away
some of Schechterle's scar tissue and re-draped the new skin from the
base of his neck to the base of his skull. Then, using skin grafts
from Schechterle's abdomen, he remade the upper and lower lips.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Schechterle can turn his head with ease and close his lips.
He can even eat a cheeseburger.</TE>
<TE>   Also this summer, Schechterle had three painful operations to
attempt to restore mobility to his right fingers. Earlier operations
-- including one last year in which Schechterle's left index finger
was transplanted to give him a new thumb -- restored what's called
"key pinch" to both hands.</TE>
<TE>   It is that function, the squeezing of his thumbs and forefingers,
that enables him to turn on a car, grip the steering wheel, write his
name and hold his baby's bottle.</TE>
<TE>   Schechterle has other ambitions. He plans to meet with a woman who
teaches the disabled to play golf; he once excelled at the game. And
he is determined to shoot a gun again.</TE>
<TE>   "I know there are some things that I will never do again, and most
things I will never do the same way again, but I am dedicated to
getting as much of my life back as I can," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most successful treatment to date has involved
Schechterle's eyes, which were so badly scarred that he was legally
blind.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. William McLeish of the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale used special
eyedrops to heal the corneas, then rebuilt Schechterle's eyelids
using cartilage from what was left of his nose and inserted a new
tear duct in his right eye.</TE>
<TE>   Schechterle was fitted with a contact lens that improved the
vision in his left eye to almost 20-20, and McLeish hopes to do the
same for the right eye.</TE>
<TE>   Among Schechterle's top goals was to get back behind the wheel.
Shortly after his 30th birthday in November, he purchased a new,
electric-blue pickup. Unlike his old truck, this one has an automatic
transmission and remote keyless entry, making it easier to handle.</TE>
<TE>   He was more adamant about work and set a target: Once the baby
arrived, he was going back.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks after Masen was born, Schechterle returned to the
department as a public affairs liaison. Although he misses patrol
duty, he is thrilled to wear a badge again.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because I don't have a gun, just because I'm not taking
somebody to jail, doesn't mean I'm not doing what I wanted to do," he
said. "I'm just taking a little different route."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his accomplishments, Schechterle still struggles with his
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   He can speak in front of hundreds of people, Suzie notes, but he
won't go to the grocery store or visit the park until sundown.
Earlier this year, while in New York to meet with a specialist, he
wouldn't leave the hotel until his friends bought him an oversized
sweatshirt with a hood.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman, his friend, offers an explanation: "It's not something
he's ashamed of, but he doesn't want to frighten other people who
aren't prepared to see something like that."</TE>
<TE>   Some are scared. During one recent speech, a third-grader blurted
out: "I think you're gonna give me nightmares tonight."</TE>
<TE>   All Schechterle could say was, "I'm sorry, buddy."</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't upset me because it's a child," he said later. "But
it's also a sad reminder."</TE>
<TE>   He worries about embarrassing his own children once they get
older, says Suzie, who insists that those fears are unfounded.</TE>
<TE>   "Kiley is instant popularity because of who her dad is. All the
little kids Zane goes to preschool with know who Dad is. But he still
worries," she said. "He never wants to be a burden."</TE>
<TE>   For now, Schechterle plans to forgo further reconstructive work on
his face. One specialist suggested rebuilding it piece-by-piece using
skin grafts from the rest of his body, but the procedure seemed too
invasive, and Schechterle knows that little can be done to restore
his appearance.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't even wear his prosthetic ears and nose all that often
because they replace only a small piece of the missing puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't look at me and go, 'You don't have any ears!' That's
not what they're looking at. I am one full scar from the neck up," he
said. "Appearance is never going to look good."</TE>
<TE>   Suzie sees it another way: "It's a badge of courage he wears."</TE>
<TE>   Schechterle will always fight contracting scars that could limit
his motion, but ongoing therapy and surgery can correct that. In the
meantime, he wants to focus on family and work -- the two things most
responsible for his emotional recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Friends also credit something else. In one critical way,
Schechterle hasn't changed at all. When he sets his mind to
something, he'll do whatever it takes to accomplish it.</TE>
<TE>   And Jason Schechterle was determined to reclaim his life.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't look at something as a challenge or obstacle," Chapman
said. "He looks at it as when he's going to overcome those challenges
and obstacles. That's his idea of winning."</TE>
<TE>   "Jason really just made a choice," added Sgt. Lauri Williams,
Schechterle's supervisor at the police department. " 'The destiny of
my life is in my own hands. And I want to be happy.'</TE>
<TE>   "He'll exude to you the power of his spirit, the power of his
life."</TE>

<HD>Lives Are Shattered by Needle Sharing at Cancer Clinic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joseph B. Verrengia</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>FREMONT, Neb.</DL>
<LD>Squinting through the red chemo fog clouding her vision, breast
cancer patient Jill Watson couldn't be sure that she was seeing this
right.</LD>
<LD>   A nurse had just used a needle and syringe to flush the catheter
implanted in Watson's chest with saline solution. Watson was sure of
that much. She had felt the needle's pinch.</LD>
<LD>   As the nurse moved on to repeat the procedure on the next patient
in the small clinic, Watson craned her neck to watch. Was the nurse
using the same syringe and the same saline bag? Could that possibly
be right?</LD>
<TE>   Watson tried to think about that, but she was so very tired.</TE>
<TE>   More than a year later, Watson's cancer was in remission. But she
got something in the mail that took her back to the cancer clinic and
had her replaying that scene in her mind again and again.</TE>
<TE>   It was a letter from the state health department. Several people
in the Fremont area had been infected with hepatitis C, the letter
said. And all of them had been treated at the same clinic as Watson.
In all, 612 patients of Dr. Tahir Javed would have to be tested for
the virus.</TE>
<TE>   After the testing, 81 of the clinic's patients got devastating
news. Because the clinic had failed to use the most basic sanitary
precautions, they had contracted a disease that can be fatal and
often requires a liver transplant.</TE>
<TE>   To public health workers, it was shocking -- all the more so
because it was not the first time that this had happened. Less than
two months before the September outbreak in Fremont, it was
discovered that 80 people were infected with hepatitis C in Norman,
Okla., when a nurse there reused needles and syringes.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very concerned about this," said Beth Bell, chief
epidemiologist in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
viral hepatitis division. "Two outbreaks of the magnitude of Nebraska
and Oklahoma so close in time are unprecedented."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Today, Javed's oncology clinic, in a space rented from the Fremont
Area Medical Center, sits padlocked.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife and children returned to Pakistan in July. He has
not contacted his patients since.</TE>
<TE>   His disappearance is a stinging slap to a community whose slogan
is "Fremont: We're What You've Been Looking For!"</TE>
<TE>   People thought that Javed had found it when he agreed to direct
the new Fremont Cancer Clinic. Part of the deal: a three-story,
$5.2-million oncology center now under construction to rival cancer
clinics in Omaha and Lincoln.</TE>
<TE>   Embracing both biotechnology and a foreign-born doctor seemed like
a bold plan for this town of 24,000.</TE>
<TE>   Fremont is a 19th-century rail hub surrounded by flat horizons of
cornfield stubble and rich black earth. Family-owned stores still
crowd Main Street like a diorama of a past America -- Lou's Sporting
Goods next to Sampter's Clothiers &amp; Tuxedo Rentals, across from Abe
Krasne Home Furnishings. Outside the hardware store, gleaming
rototillers and snow blowers line up on the sidewalk like spiffy
soldiers for inspection.</TE>
<TE>   Men here aren't likely to drive very far in their pickup trucks
without wearing a ball cap and chewing a toothpick.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, nobody recalls seeing Javed -- a trim man with
rectangular eyeglasses and a shock of coal-black hair -- wearing
anything but a suit and tie. His credentials include postgraduate
work at three U.S. universities.</TE>
<TE>   Around Fremont, the whispers are deafening.</TE>
<TE>   Local real estate agents combing through property records learned
that Javed sold his home over the summer.</TE>
<TE>   He told townspeople that his busy practice supported a free clinic
and school in a remote corner of his native Punjab province near the
border with India. An Internet Web site soliciting contributions
describes the Javed Welfare Foundation as a "very small foundation
being started by our family and friends ... to provide services to
the needy, sick and poor."</TE>
<TE>   In October, Javed, 37, was elected to the Punjab provincial
assembly. His family is politically active; his father was mayor of
their village.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney, Michael Jones of Omaha, says Javed has not decided
whether to return to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be easy to turn this into a witch hunt," Jones said. "He
is a very caring physician. He did not know what happened in the
clinic or how it happened."</TE>
<TE>   Many patients still praise Javed for his gentle bedside manner,
noting that he would drive patients home and answer their midnight
telephone calls.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe he hasn't come back," Jill Watson said.</TE>
<TE>   Other patients apparently never noticed that something was amiss
at Javed's clinic. But Watson worked as a clerk at the hospital,
including the infection control office.</TE>
<TE>   She applied to be Javed's receptionist when he moved to Fremont in
1998 from the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't get the job. But she helped the hospital foundation
raise money to buy the recliners used in the chemotherapy clinic.</TE>
<TE>   During one of her groggy chemo sessions, Watson screwed up her
courage and asked the nurse why she wasn't wearing protective gloves.</TE>
<TE>   "Latex allergy," the nurse replied, offering her red, scaly claws
for inspection.</TE>
<TE>   Shouldn't she be using more than one syringe?</TE>
<TE>   "Everything's fine," Watson was assured. "Now lie back before you
start clotting."</TE>
<TE>   Watson rewinds the memory over and over.</TE>
<TE>   "Why didn't she know better?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Tom Safranek asks that question too.</TE>
<TE>   As Nebraska's state epidemiologist, he has grown accustomed to
rapid-fire updates on West Nile virus.</TE>
<TE>   And bioterrorism. With hoofed animals outnumbering humans 5-to-1
here, Homeland Security officials are pumping $9.7 million into
Nebraska for anthrax surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   But the call he got in late September about two hepatitis C
carriers jolted him.</TE>
<TE>   Both patients had genotype 3A. That strain accounts for fewer than
10% of all viral hepatitis C cases in the United States. And both
patients received chemotherapy at the Fremont clinic beginning in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to test everyone who's been at the clinic," Safranek
said. "We don't know how big the risk is."</TE>
<TE>   How did it happen? Safranek called the chemo nurse. Quickly, his
suspicions matched Watson's fears.</TE>
<TE>   His summary: The nurse used a sterile needle to pierce each
patient's chest valve. But when she flushed their ports, she would
uncouple the syringe and fill it from a jumbo saline bag.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-2000, one of the patients at the clinic was already
unknowingly infected with HCV. Once that patient's syringe touched
the saline, as many as 49 additional patients whose chest valves also
were flushed with saline from the same bag were exposed to the virus.</TE>
<TE>   The nurse repeated the dirty practice, bag after bag, for more
than a year. In all, 621 patients were exposed.</TE>
<TE>   "You always have a bag of saline going, so, in effect, you are
continuously contaminated," Safranek said.</TE>
<TE>   State health officials will decide whether to suspend or revoke
the nurse's license. The nurse has not been officially identified.
She has not responded to repeated calls by the Associated Press at
her home in Fremont.</TE>
<TE>   She left Javed's clinic in June 2001. Now she works at an Omaha
hospital; her supervisors told Safranek that she works under tighter
controls than at the small Fremont clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Safranek doesn't excuse the nurse's apparent ignorance. "You're
supposed to learn this stuff in nursing school," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he wondered: "Why wasn't there sufficient supervision or
education or training in the back of that clinic?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hospital-acquired infections kill 90,000 Americans annually. Most
are infected by antibiotic-resistant superbugs that defy the most
aggressive controls.</TE>
<TE>   Hepatitis C is different. Outbreaks can be traced to ignorance of
basic sterile practices, rules that are, in the words of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, "well established and
long-standing."</TE>
<TE>   Yet in Brooklyn, N.Y., 19 patients were infected at a neighborhood
clinic in 2001 when an anesthesiologist reused needles and a vial of
medication.</TE>
<TE>   And earlier this year, 52 people were infected with HCV by nurse
anesthetist James C. Hill in Norman, Okla. He admitted that he reused
needles and syringes up to 25 times a day when he injected back pain
medication through intravenous tubes.</TE>
<TE>   Health authorities say his mistake was not intentional.</TE>
<TE>   After that incident, the American Assn. of Nurse Anesthetists sent
out more than 30,000 letters warning hospitals and nurses not to
reuse needles.</TE>
<TE>   "After discussion with infection-control experts, we have concerns
there may be a widespread misunderstanding by health care
practitioners of the dangers associated with the reuse of needles and
syringes," the letter said.</TE>
<TE>   Viral hepatitis C is perhaps the most common blood-borne infection
in the United States with 4 million carriers. HCV slowly attacks the
liver. Symptoms might not appear for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   It kills up to 10,000 Americans each year. Federal health
officials expect the rate of infection to quadruple in the next 10
years.</TE>
<TE>   The virus is rampant among IV drug addicts and prison inmates who
share tattoo needles. But it also spreads among chronically ill
patients who regularly receive infusions and injections -- especially
those on dialysis.</TE>
<TE>   If the immune system doesn't clear the virus naturally, physicians
turn to a combination drug therapy that lasts 12 to 48 weeks. Among
the strains of hepatitis C, genotype 3A is among those that respond
better to the drugs, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the drugs' side effects are multiple neuropsychiatric
symptoms, including severe depression, psychosis, even suicide.</TE>
<TE>   The alternative is a $350,000 liver transplant and a lifetime on
powerful anti-rejection drugs. Fourteen thousand Americans are on
waiting lists for liver transplants.</TE>
<TE>   Those were the prospects facing Watson, already struggling to beat
cancer.</TE>
<TE>   During the three-week wait for her test results, she focused on
her three children and the routines of any young mother. Laundry.
Homework. Halloween costumes. Christmas shopping.</TE>
<TE>   On a Tuesday morning, the letter came.</TE>
<TE>   She gasped for joy.</TE>
<TE>   "I am happy to inform you that your blood has tested NEGATIVE,"
the form letter read.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on this information we are confident that you ARE NOT
infected. No further testing or medical care is necessary."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grandmothers. Farmers. Teachers. Grain loaders. Even a paramedic.</TE>
<TE>   Fremont attorney Jim Davis finds worried people by the dozen
sitting on his cold office steps in the morning. They're waiting for
him after lunch. They keep him working late into the evening.</TE>
<TE>   They are Javed's patients and the survivors of patients who died.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to schedule them one every hour, but they just walk in,"
said Davis, who previously won class-action lawsuits against failed
vaccines and defective orthopedic bone screws. "In their mental
state, I'm not going to tell them to make an appointment."</TE>
<TE>   In Dodge County, at least three patients have filed lawsuits
against Javed and the hospital. The largest claim is for $1.25
million, filed by Thomas W. Stover and his wife, Lois. Stover was
infected with hepatitis.</TE>
<TE>   The Stovers probably won't get rich. Nebraska is one of the few
states that does not allow victims to collect punitive damages.
Survivor payouts in wrongful death judgments are limited too.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be no windfalls," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Who will pay? Hospital officials say they just rented clinic space
to Javed.</TE>
<TE>   State health officials describe the clinic as a "gray area." They
say the health care industry is relying more on outpatient clinics
because they generate profits with less regulatory oversight --
including infection control.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who grew up in Fremont and once worked as a road manager
for country singer Willie Nelson, wants to establish a
multimillion-dollar trust to finance drug therapy and extended
patient care. But first he must establish whether Javed still has
malpractice insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably a given that some of these people are going to need
liver transplants down the road," he said.</TE>

<HD>Lost in New York? Try the Finds at Grand Central</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Verena Dobnik</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>What could an artificial leg, an Armani jacket, a $15,000 diamond
ring and a glass eyeball possibly have in common?</LD>
<LD>   Those and other objects, strange and mundane, wound up at the lost
and found department of Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal, a
monument to careless commuters.</LD>
<LD>   On any given day, about 4,000 lost possessions line the steel gray
shelves and racks of a mammoth room off the terminal's lower
concourse, just across from the famed Oyster Bar. On a sunny fall
day, the windowless chamber sheltered a single crutch, a police badge
and architectural blueprints. One bin was marked "September glasses,"
another "October glasses."</LD>
<TE>   Last year, Pete Seeger's banjo landed there, but it found its way
back to the folk singer, who lives north of New York City.</TE>
<TE>   About 125,000 passengers use the Metro-North railroad daily to
commute from the city's northern suburbs and Connecticut, with Grand
Central as the terminus.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the oddest item to make it to the lost and found was an
urn of human ashes, although that may have been a product of
intentional forgetfulness.</TE>
<TE>   The urn was never claimed, said Fred Chidester, an ex-cop who
managed the lost and found for years. Months later, a man called
Metro-North to say that he had read about the abandoned ashes; he
claimed that he knew the woman who left them on the train -- as
revenge for her husband's alleged infidelity.</TE>
<TE>   "He would call her at home to say the train was late, or that the
train bypassed the station, or that he fell asleep. But those were
excuses so he could meet his girlfriend," Chidester said. "So when he
died, his wife thought it was fitting that she leave his ashes on the
train."</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 on Grand Central's list of most commonly lost items is the
cell phone, with 250 to 300 turned in each month.</TE>
<TE>   Keys are the next most common item, followed by eyeglasses, coats
and jackets, and umbrellas. (However, this year's drought has cut
down on the number of lost umbrellas.)</TE>
<TE>   The fact is, forgetfulness is weather-sensitive: When it turns
cold, the coat racks expand.</TE>
<TE>   "You can tell the weather down here," said Margie Anders,
spokeswoman for Metro-North.</TE>
<TE>   The smorgasbord of lost items in the last few years has included a
film script with director's instructions scribbled in the margins, a
.357-Magnum handgun, fishing poles and a child's violin. Laptops and
blue blazers, the corporate commuter's gear, turn up all the time.</TE>
<TE>   After 90 days, most items become the property of the finder if he
or she is interested. One man was honest enough to turn in a $1 bill
-- and penny-wise enough to leave his name in case it was not
claimed.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, the items are given away. On this day, seven bags of
clothing were ready for charitable donation.</TE>
<TE>   In early November, 249 pairs of eyeglasses were going to the Lions
Club in Connecticut, which recycles the lenses and gives them to the
poor in Third World countries. Coats and toys go to such charities as
Goodwill and Toys for Tots.</TE>
<TE>   Items worth $5,000 or more, such as digital cameras and jewelry,
are stored in a safe and, by law, must be kept for three years before
they're up for grabs.</TE>
<TE>   The $15,000 diamond was stashed in one of three bags forgotten by
a woman at the Poughkeepsie train station.</TE>
<TE>   She was lucky and got everything back.</TE>
<TE>   The Grand Central lost and found averages a high return rate. So
far this year, about 60% of the items turned in have been retrieved
by their owners.</TE>
<TE>   That compares favorably to Tokyo Station, where about 30% of items
find their way back to their owners, says Paul Noguchi, an urban
anthropologist who has studied lost and founds throughout the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone thought that if you lost something in New York, that was
the end of it," said Noguchi, a professor at Bucknell University in
Lewisburg, Pa. "The surprise is that a lot of people turn in stuff in
New York City. New Yorkers are still basically honest."</TE>
<TE>   The success rate at Grand Central may also be due to methodology:
Each lost item is entered into a computer database, with details such
as label names and contents of pockets.</TE>
<TE>   Employees also take the initiative to find an item's owner -- for
instance, looking through a cell phone to locate a home number.</TE>
<TE>   "It's partially a detective job," said Mike Nolan, current manager
of Grand Central's lost and found.</TE>
<TE>   Some people walk away with a smile. Russ Cooper, who calls himself
"a regular customer" at Grand Central's lost and found, left his
sports jacket on the train to New Haven, Conn., in October.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the first chilly day of the season," said the acoustics
consultant from Wilton, Conn., who wasn't used to wearing a jacket.</TE>
<TE>   After he retrieved it, Cooper reached into a pocket. "Let's see if
my keys are still here," he said, flashing a smile as he pulled out a
full key chain.</TE>

<HD>Day at Dental Spa Takes a Bite Out of Tension</HD>
<DH>Dentists find ways to calm skittish patients. Aromatherapy,
massage, manicure and even Botox injections are among the
attractions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jill Barton</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>BOCA RATON, Fla.</DL>
<LD>During those dreaded moments when her dentist drills and scrapes,
Nancy Rubenstein enjoys a back massage, a manicure, a cool mask for
her eyes and slippers to warm her feet.</LD>
<LD>   If that isn't enough, she can slip on virtual reality glasses and
escape to Hawaii or some other exotic place as the aroma of
chocolate-chip cookies drifts from a nearby oven.</LD>
<LD>   "Can I come here on vacation?" Rubenstein jokes after her dentist,
Dr. Kenneth Mogell, peers into her mouth during a recent checkup.</LD>
<TE>   Mogell started adding the cozy touches -- aromatherapy candles,
warm pillows, spa services -- to make dental appointments less
frightening and even enjoyable.</TE>
<TE>   The concept is becoming more popular nationally, with dental
offices making simple additions, such as massage-padded chairs, to
complete transformations that make the office look like luxurious day
spas.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to distract them so much that they don't notice the fact
that I'm putting a needle in their mouths," Mogell said from a dimly
lighted office with cozy seating reminiscent of a home library.</TE>
<TE>   The spa-like approach is designed to attract the dental-phobic --
clients too anxious to go through with their dental appointments. It
helps bring in those who might seek out beauty treatments. Some
offices offer Botox and collagen injections to help erase any smile
lines around those new porcelain whites.</TE>
<TE>   The pampering -- cosmetic dentistry services, for instance -- also
draws clients who typically need less dental work than their parents
did.</TE>
<TE>   Far fewer people are missing their teeth than 20 years ago,
according to the latest U.S. Surgeon General's report. Young adults,
on average, have 20 permanent teeth without fillings or decay today
compared with 16 in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, less than two-thirds of adults visited a dentist in
the last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the money that Americans spend on dental work is climbing
by billions of dollars each year, with $60 billion spent two years
ago on oral health. The vast majority of dentists also report that
they do some cosmetic procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Gary Green, who specializes in reparative and cosmetic
dentistry in his St. Louis-based practice, said he won't entirely
copy the spa trend that's creeping up and down the East and West
coasts. Green has patients who sit in his chair for four or five
hours at a time to get their smiles completely reconstructed, so it
helps if they're relaxed and comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   But he said having a masseuse work on his patients' feet while
he's working on their mouths might compromise the sterile
environment. And if a masseur tickles the wrong spot, that could
cause problems.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't afford to have the patient move. We need their undivided
attention," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Green is considering renting space in his historic
mansion-turned-office to a massage therapist who can work with
clients before and after appointments. He also offers small touches
-- stereo headphones, scented candles and warm pillows.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at a time now where people want instant gratification, and
any way we can make it easier for them is good for both of us," Green
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some services at dental spas cost little more than a traditional
dentist. At Mogell's office, teeth cleanings start at $75, just below
the national average of $85. And there are no additional fees for
clients who choose to take advantage of the spa treatments, lipstick
samples or other perks.</TE>
<TE>   Dental spas that offer more elaborate services, such as Houston's
Imagemax Dental Day Spa, charge for each treatment separately. There,
clients can breathe pure oxygen in a Japanese Zen garden before
having a $160 bubble-jet gum massage as part of their teeth cleaning.
They can spend the rest of the day pampering the rest of their
bodies, with seaweed body wraps, micro-dermabrasion facials, hot
stone massages and Botox injections.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Kimberly Harms, a consumer advisor for the American Dental
Assn., said patients, many of whom have become more accustomed to
conveniences and small comforts in their daily lives, are driving the
changes.</TE>
<TE>   Harms, who describes herself as a dental-phobic patient, said she
designed her Farmington, Minn., office with a living room, library
and garden with birds, flowers, trees and water.</TE>
<TE>   Although the services vary, most dentists say they want their
offices to feel less like a doctor's office and more like home.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Mogell doesn't mind if his patients sully their freshly
cleaned smiles with a warm chocolate-chip cookie.</TE>
<TE>   "We just like to spoil everybody," he said.</TE>

<HD>When Teen Pregnancy Runs in the Family</HD>

<DL>ALOHA, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Following in her parents' footsteps was not what Michelle Grant had
planned.</LD>
<LD>   But there she was: pregnant at age 17 and living back in Colorado
with her mother, a year after running away. She had no money. She'd
dropped out of school. And the baby's father, nearly 14 years older,
was 600 miles away.</LD>
<LD>   A few weeks later, wearing a white sweater that she'd chosen at
Goodwill, she married the father, Paul Grant, in a courthouse
ceremony -- much as her own parents had done when Michelle's mom was
a pregnant teen.</LD>
<TE>   Somehow, their fate had become hers, seemingly handed down from
parent to child.</TE>
<TE>   The shared experiences of pregnancy and young motherhood have been
bonding points for Michelle and her mom, Debbie Tierney. Their
relationship was turbulent when Michelle was growing up.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd now say that my mom is my best friend. She really is," said
Michelle, who just turned 20 and is the mother of two. She and
Tierney talk by phone several times a week, more than they did when
Michelle was at home.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Tierney says, as close as they've become, she never wanted
her daughter to end up like her. She calls teen pregnancy the family
curse -- something they have in common, yes -- but a twist of fate
that she fears will forever hold Michelle back, as it did her.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought she could ...," Tierney pauses and starts again. "Well,
I guess she still can have a good life, get a good job, be
financially stable.</TE>
<TE>   "This just makes it so much harder."</TE>
<TE>   The reasons behind the cycle of teen pregnancy are complicated and
varied. But researchers do know that parents -- present and absent --
play a key role. They have found that a young mother's loss of
education and work opportunities tend to perpetuate the cycle.</TE>
<TE>   That was the case for Michelle's mom. She dropped out of college
and often struggled financially to rear Michelle and her three
brothers, especially after she and their father divorced.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle is determined that it will be different for her family.</TE>
<TE>   That's what she told herself and her unborn baby, whom she felt
kicking as she successfully completed the test for her GED. "If I can
do this, things will be better," she said, uttering what has become
her personal mantra.</TE>
<TE>   She and Paul have moved the family to Aloha, a suburb of Portland,
and Michelle is taking a full load of classes at a nearby community
college. She plans to become a nurse.</TE>
<TE>   She's as proud of the grades she's earning -- an A, a few Bs and a
C -- as she is of the photo albums she's lovingly made for her
children, Conner and Skyla, now 2 1/2 and 1.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to do the best I can to help make my children better
people," Michelle said. "Some people might not believe it. But for
the first time in my life, I really believe I can."</TE>
<TE>   Her optimism sometimes belies her difficult reality -- the kind
her mother foresaw.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, Paul lost his job doing over-the-phone technical
support for a cell phone company. His search for work has been slowed
by a serious circulatory condition called phlebitis. And even with
help from their families, Michelle says they sometimes throw bills
they can't pay in the trash.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel like we're two little kids playing house. We're not
taking care of ourselves. It's a horrible feeling," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her mom can't help but worry.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell her I'd do what I need to do to pay the bills. I'd get a
second job, a third job. She says she understands, but nothing
changes," said Tierney, who works for an insurance company and lives
in Aurora, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Kentucky, Michelle spent most of her childhood in
Colorado. Her mom says she was a bright, talkative child who didn't
like to share attention with her brothers.</TE>
<TE>   When Michelle was 8, her parents divorced. And by Michelle's own
admission, her anger over the split made her increasingly difficult
and willful. She often shifted between her parents' homes, especially
after her mom remarried. Her temper could be explosive.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a reputation as the 'problem child,' " Michelle said. "So,
eventually, I kind of gave up trying to be good. It was always going
to be my fault anyway."</TE>
<TE>   She remembers, at age 14, adding a line to a genealogy project for
school: "I do not plan on having children," she wrote next to her
drawing of a crystal ball.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the world was too harsh to bring kids into it," she now
says. "I thought they'd be screwed up -- that I wouldn't be a good
mom."</TE>
<TE>   Then at 15, Michelle met Paul in an online computer chat room.</TE>
<TE>   As their friendship deepened by telephone, her relationship with
her parents worsened.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after her 16th birthday, she overheard her mom and
stepfather, at their wits' end, discuss sending her to a foster home.</TE>
<TE>   She'd also been fighting more with her biological father, who
pressed charges against her for hitting him. The threat of juvenile
jail loomed.</TE>
<TE>   Upset, Michelle asked Paul to wire money for a plane ticket to
Portland. He did. And without a word, she left home on Dec. 1, 1998
-- ditching school and problems that she hoped to escape forever.</TE>
<TE>   Paul, she says, offered a chance to start over and stuck by her
when she eventually admitted lying about her age. (She had told him
she was 18.)</TE>
<TE>   "I just needed someone to be there for me, who would just trust me
and have faith in me," Michelle said, looking at Paul as he played on
their living room floor with Skyla. "Everybody said he'd run away and
leave me -- but he never did."</TE>
<TE>   That emotional security made having her own family seem possible.
But financial security eluded Michelle and Paul, who moved to
Corning, a small Northern California town, to live with his parents.</TE>
<TE>   By summer, she was pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle returned to Colorado, where she got her GED and spent a
few days in jail to resolve the charges over the fight with her dad,
although she no longer speaks to him. Meanwhile, Paul found work with
a computer-maker in Chandler, Ariz. -- a sign, Michelle's mom
thought, that he was serious about supporting her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   In February 2000, she signed papers allowing the marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew the baby was coming. And I didn't see the point of keeping
her from the life she wanted," Tierney said. She added, "And
honestly, it took some of the burden off me."</TE>
<TE>   Conner was born two months later, and the family eventually wound
up in Oregon, where Paul has been in and out of technical-support
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Because of his illness -- and resulting infections and blood clots
in his legs -- he plans to apply for disability through Social
Security if he can't find work. Meanwhile, Michelle is looking for a
weekend job to help replace monthly $600 unemployment checks that are
about to run out.</TE>
<TE>   Their struggles, Michelle says, have changed her view of family,
especially her mom.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a new respect for what she went through, raising me and my
brothers," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle's expectations for her kids: "I want them to be confident
and social. I want them to feel safe. I want them to feel like they
can talk to me, trust me."</TE>
<TE>   And she wants them to get an education.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to college so they can go to college," she said as she
picked up Conner. She moved her face close to his and smiled. "You
better go to college!"</TE>

<HD>Secret Slaughter of Exotic Animals Revealed</HD>
<DH>Federal agents probe a world in which tigers, lions are
shot in cages for profit. Despite the arrest of 16 people, legal
penalties are light.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sharon Cohen</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>ALSIP, Ill.</DL>
<LD>The trailer loaded with nine tigers and two lions rolled past the
wire-fenced gates under the cover of night so that no outsiders were
around to see what was about to happen.</LD>
<LD>   Heavy double doors lifted and the zebra-striped truck that had
hauled the trailer from Wisconsin entered the brightly lighted
warehouse.</LD>
<LD>   Two men waited inside with handguns.</LD>
<TE>   The driver got out, carrying a stick. He poked it through the
slats of the trailer to prod the trapped animals into position to
make it easier for the shooters taking aim.</TE>
<TE>   The gunmen opened fire, killing eight of the tigers.</TE>
<TE>   Their work had just begun.</TE>
<TE>   All three men dragged the bloody carcasses out of the trailer and
onto the concrete floor. The shooters began skinning the tigers, then
loaded them up for their final destination: an exotic butcher shop in
another suburb of Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   There, according to the one of the gunmen, the skinning was
completed, and the carcasses hung on hooks, weighed and sold by the
pound. But tiger meat, authorities say, was labeled as lion -- which
is legal to sell.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, the driver of the truck was frustrated. He still
had a tiger and two lions in that load that had been rejected because
they were too small. Now he wanted to get rid of them.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm gonna shoot 'em and throw 'em in a hole!" he warned.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This secret slaughter in March 1998, described in court records by
two of those involved, was part of a ruthless black market: a ring
that, authorities say, bought, killed and sold endangered species --
tigers and leopards -- for tens of thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an old saying that if you can make a dollar off of it,
there will be someone trying to kill it and sell it," said Tim
Santel, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent who led a 4 1/2-year
investigation that resulted in charges against 16 people.</TE>
<TE>   The illegal trade in exotic and endangered species, from big cats
to tiny beetles and butterflies, is a multibillion-dollar business.</TE>
<TE>   Some are smugglers who cross international borders with fragile
and sometimes dangerous animals -- Komodo dragons in suitcases,
pythons around their waists.</TE>
<TE>   Others work inside the United States, trading in rare animals from
roadside zoos and mom-and-pop game parks, specialty magazines and
Internet sites.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation led by Santel underscored a cruel reality: There
may be more tigers in private hands in the United States than in the
wild -- and, chopped up for their meat and hides, they can be worth
more dead than alive.</TE>
<TE>   "You still have these black holes of horror and butchery going
on," said Jim Mason, an animal activist in Missouri. "It's like the
drug trade. We know it's bad ... but we don't have the means or the
will to put an end to it."</TE>
<TE>   Santel and other wildlife agents documented the killing of 17
tigers, one leopard and one barasingha, an Asian swamp deer -- all
endangered -- along with numerous African lions, cougars and ligers
(a tiger-lion hybrid), which are not.</TE>
<TE>   The cats were shot at close range while confined to cages or
trailers.</TE>
<TE>   Agents tracked a ring that spanned eight states -- Illinois,
Michigan, Arkansas, Florida, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, Kansas and Missouri
-- and involved animal park owners, taxidermists and "trophy
hunters," whose only safari was into an underground that thrives on
the slaughter of captive animals.</TE>
<TE>   The ring shed light on a world where wildlife agents are spread
thin, where tigers can be cheap -- a litter might go for as little as
$750 -- and where the laws are filled with loopholes that are readily
exploited.</TE>
<TE>   Even when traffickers are caught, critics complain, the punishment
isn't all that severe.</TE>
<TE>   "For the most part ... it's really just a slap on the wrist," said
Alan Green, author of "Animal Underworld," an expose of the
trafficking of exotic and endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   Judges and prosecutors aren't necessarily to blame; federal
guidelines limit the length of sentences.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen of the 16 people charged in this case have pleaded
guilty; two await court dates. The charges included violating the
Endangered Species Act, which addresses the killing, and the Lacey
Act, which covers the sale and transport of protected animals.</TE>
<TE>   Of 10 people sentenced so far, Stoney Elam, former operator of an
Oklahoma exotic animal farm, received the stiffest punishment: one
year, half in home confinement. He also was ordered to pay a $5,000
fine to the Fish and Wildlife Foundation's Save the Tiger Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Elam sold two tigers and three leopards to an undercover agent for
$4,800, then falsified the paperwork to make it look as if it was a
lawful donation.</TE>
<TE>   It is a federal violation to sell endangered animals across state
lines, but donations are permitted.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Lantz, the driver who delivered the cats to the warehouse and
brokered another deal involving four tigers that were later killed,
was sentenced to five months in prison and fined $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Vicki, who pleaded guilty to aiding in the sale of
tigers, received six months' home detention.</TE>
<TE>   A judge condemned their conduct as cowardly.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the success of this case, Green, the author, says it's
hard to get prosecutors to make such cases a high priority.</TE>
<TE>   "If a wildlife agent goes to a district attorney and says, 'I've
got a case of a guy who killed a tiger,' they've got a guy who's
moving tons of heroin," he said. "Is the tiger that important in
their mind?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tim Santel got the call in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   An exotic-animal dealer in southern Illinois said she had heard
that people in the Chicago area wanted to buy big cats to shoot them
for their skins.</TE>
<TE>   Santel frequently gets tips, but as one of about 240 wildlife
agents nationwide, his resources are limited.</TE>
<TE>   But Sherry Roche's tip -- with its suggestion of cruelty and
commercialization -- turned out to be worth pursuing.</TE>
<TE>   To infiltrate the ring, wildlife agents posed as big game hunters,
a hired hand, an interior decorator and animal dealers.</TE>
<TE>   Working with informants, the agents gained the confidence of the
traffickers, transporting animals, making deals and witnessing the
falsifying of records.</TE>
<TE>   Money was the motive for most of those involved.</TE>
<TE>   But some were collectors -- including Dr. Robert Martinez, a
family practitioner who lives in Palos Heights, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   He is a hunter, but in this case, his hunting amounted to killing
four caged cats; he pleaded guilty to shooting the endangered one, a
black leopard. In his plea, Martinez said he paid $6,000 to buy the
four animals and also admitted killing a tiger in a trailer.</TE>
<TE>   He sometimes posed with his kill: According to an affidavit, he
showed undercover agents a photo of himself with the dead tiger and
pictures with bears he claimed that he had illegally bagged in Russia
and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez declined comment, but his lawyer, James Valentino, said
the doctor "got caught up with this idea of having these mounts," and
offered a comparison:</TE>
<TE>   "Why does a woman want alligator shoes or purse?"</TE>
<TE>   That attitude isn't unusual, says Craig Hoover, deputy director of
TRAFFIC North America, the wildlife trade monitoring arm of the World
Wildlife Fund.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a status thing," he said. "There's this mentality that I
need to have one of everything in my trophy room."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To build their case, wildlife agents used video cameras to conduct
surveillance and even installed one inside a trailer used to haul
animals.</TE>
<TE>   They faced a dilemma: how to keep the investigation going to
determine how widespread the ring was without jeopardizing more cats.</TE>
<TE>   "How many animals do you let them kill to document it?" asked Dan
Burleson, a wildlife agent who posed as a hired hand.</TE>
<TE>   A decision was made: Once an agent had witnessed the killing of an
endangered animal, investigators would try to intervene to stop the
deaths of others.</TE>
<TE>   On April 1, 1998, Burleson got a grisly, firsthand look.</TE>
<TE>   The setting was Roche's farm as Burleson watched two warehouse
shooters -- Kevin Ramsey, who pleaded guilty, and Bill Kapp, who
awaits trial -- kill the two lions and the tiger that had been
rejected just days earlier, according to records.</TE>
<TE>   "The cats would be looking out, thinking this person was there to
provide them with food, water or some loving," Roche said. "It's just
like a dog waiting at the door and somebody shooting them."</TE>
<TE>   Agents tried to save animals before others could get to them: They
paid Tim Rivers -- who also pleaded guilty -- $1,750 for a panther
and pair of black leopards.</TE>
<TE>   The leopards had special billing: They had reportedly appeared on
the TV show "Miami Vice."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There are just too many tigers.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say there may be as many as 10,000 captive-bred tigers in
private hands in the United States -- compared with up to 7,500 in
the wild.</TE>
<TE>   A tiger can be bought for $1,000, or even less. Its parts can
generate a lot more.</TE>
<TE>   In Santel's case, the hides of two tigers and one leopard were
sold for $10,500 to a Michigan man who pleaded guilty. Meat was sold
to the market for about $3 a pound; depending on the cut, retail
prices approached $15 a pound. Internal organs were saved, believed
destined for the Asian medicinal trade, which is also a lucrative
market for tiger bones.</TE>
<TE>   A full tiger skeleton can be worth more than $61,000, according to
an estimate in a 2000 TRAFFIC report.</TE>
<TE>   The huge growth in tigers prompted the Fish and Wildlife Service
in 1998 to relax its rules for generic tigers -- the offspring of
different subspecies, such as Bengal and Siberian.</TE>
<TE>   To streamline the paperwork, people with these generic tigers no
longer needed permits to sell them across state lines; Santel says
the new rule did not change their protected status.</TE>
<TE>   But Scott Kamin, a lawyer for Bill Kapp, maintains that generic
tigers are not the endangered species protected by federal law -- and
plans to use that as his defense.</TE>
<TE>   He compared the tiger killing in this case to deer hunting.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure how different this is morally," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The only other person awaiting trial is Richard J. Czimer Jr.,
president of Czimer's Game &amp; Sea Foods, a third-generation exotic
meat market in Lockport, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   After being charged this year with buying and selling the meat of
endangered species, Czimer protested his innocence, saying animals
brought to his shop had been skinned.</TE>
<TE>   "The meat doesn't come with stripes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His lawyer, Alan Bruggeman, now says that, in most cases, Czimer
thought that he was buying lions.</TE>
<TE>   But Kevin Ramsey, who helped deliver some animals to the shop,
said in his plea that Czimer was present while he and others skinned
and gutted cats, including a leopard.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife agents visited Czimer's, bought meat labeled lion and
sent it to the agency's forensic lab in Oregon. A third of the items
tested turned out, in fact, to be tiger.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Word of this case has spread in the small world of people who deal
with exotic cats.</TE>
<TE>   Agents say they hope that the convictions will be a deterrent, but
they are pragmatic.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to cure the world," Burleson said. "As long as
there's money involved, people will try to make a profit. We know we
can't stop it. But hopefully we've got them looking over their
shoulders now."</TE>

<HD>Vuitton gets a Robert Wilson makeover</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Swed</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Louis Vuitton window displays this Christmas season are beautiful
and not to be missed. Walk around the Rodeo Drive store, particularly
at night, and the gorgeous illuminated electric oranges and lime
greens lift the spirits. They were designed by the director and
artist Robert Wilson, who sees all the world as a potential stage and
who flew into town Monday to oversee the opening of his production of
the Georg Buchner piece "Woyzeck" at UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   On hand Monday night for a reception at the Beverly Hills store,
Wilson said that he also designed a new line of handbags in those
striking colors as a theatrical counterpoint to the dark shades of
Vuitton luggage and perhaps to bring a bit of joy -- his word -- to a
world on the brink of war and beset with terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Ironically, Wilson, in an understated dark suit, was maybe the
most somber-looking person in a store crowded with flashy,
self-absorbed Hollywood fashion plates. But even this master of the
theatrical non sequitur was slightly taken aback by the woman in
leopard-striped pants who marched up to him near the entrance of the
store and asked who he was. "I'm Robert Wilson," he said.</LD>
<TE>   "Oh," she said, "are you related to Wilson tennis balls?"</TE>

<HD>'Messiah' sopranos getting younger</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Pasles</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Handel wrote the "Messiah," he could count on boys singing the
soprano parts at the age of 15 or even later. But for modern choir
directors, such as Paulist Choristers' Martin Neary, when you say
boys' choir you mean little boys.</LD>
<LD>   That's because boys' voices break much sooner these days. So in
order to have boy sopranos for his "Messiah" concert Friday at St.
Paul the Apostle Catholic Church in Westwood, Neary started working
with 7 1/2-year- olds a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   "I haven't worked before with quite this young an age group,"
Neary said. "One has got to capture their imaginations and latch onto
them."</LD>
<TE>   Why puberty for boys and girls occurs "much earlier now than it
did even 50 or 100 years ago" has not been fully established, says
Dr. Hans von Leden, professor emeritus at USC and founder and
honorary president of the Collegium Medicorum Theatri, an
international organization of physicians that focuses on singers and
actors. He suggests the use of antibiotics and better nutrition might
play a part.</TE>
<TE>   But why does Neary need boy sopranos -- why not just use girls?
"You have the tremendous advantage of a bell-like quality in the top
line," said Neary. In fact, Neary also has included girls in his
group, who sing along with 12 adults: "Both should have this
opportunity," he said. "Are we authentic? Is the sound the same?
Who's to say what the authentic sound was? There are so many
different sounds of boys' choirs. We have about 12 boys and eight
girls, but nonetheless it is a cohesive sound."</TE>

<CX>   "Messiah" concert -- An article in today's Calendar on the Paulist
Choristers' performance of Handel's "Messiah" gave the wrong date for

<LD>Is the Pasadena Playhouse's "Plaid Tidings" different from last
year's "Forever Plaid -- A Special Holiday Edition" at the same
theater?</LD>
<LD>   Yes, swears "Plaid" creator and director Stuart Ross. Ten songs
from last year's show are out, and 13 new ones are in. A Perry Como
homage has been enhanced by obtaining rights to a Como kinescope that
enables the Plaid quartet to back up "Mr. C." A tribute to the late
Rosemary Clooney has been added.</LD>
<LD>   Only one member of last year's cast, John-Michael Flate, is on
hand this year, but he has been joined by original Plaid David Engel,
original L.A. "Forever Plaid" cast member Larry Raben and New
York-based Plaid Paul Binotto in his local Plaid debut.</LD>
<TE>   Ross said he tried to clarify the plot in this year's edition, and
the Plaids "face more challenges" in the story, in which they travel
from the great beyond to do a TV Christmas special. However, "we're
not talking 'Long Day's Journey Into Night,' " Ross added.</TE>

<LD>Art often makes easy connections, jumping the synapses among memory,
experience and intention. Betye Saar, known for her politically
charged assemblage art, understands that as well as anyone. When she
was asked to donate her services to "Artful Violins," a Los Angeles
Chamber Orchestra project, she knew immediately what she wanted to
conjure.</LD>
<LD>   The orchestra asked six Los Angeles artists to transform real
violins -- donated by local shops or makers -- into artworks to be
publicly displayed for two months and then auctioned to raise money
for the orchestra at a gala Jan. 25. While some artists decided to
physically alter the instrument (Michael C. McMillen and Roy Dowell),
Saar decided to keep hers intact -- theoretically it's still playable
-- and to embellish it with her own musical associations.</LD>
<LD>   "Right away my brain said, 'What about that great photo of my
great-uncle's?' " says Saar, pointing to the finished violin, lying
on a stool in her modern split-level, sunlight-infused Laurel Canyon
studio. "I was really enthralled with this photograph."</LD>
<TE>   A copy has been laminated onto the back of the instrument and
features seven black musicians, formally posing in the garden of the
Libya, an elegant Harlem restaurant her great-uncle Robert Keys
opened in 1913 and ran for about two decades. Saar never saw the
restaurant, only heard about it, and inherited the original
photograph when her great-aunt died in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Five nattily dressed men hold their instruments -- bass, clarinet,
trumpet, cello and violin. The two women in the picture, in
ankle-length dresses, "probably played the piano and sang," Saar
suggests.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the family connection, she likes what the photograph might
convey to anyone looking at it. "This was a classy act, this was a
classy kind of place too," she says. "I think it's important for
people to know that African Americans did have some class -- they
still do, of course. This makes a statement just from the way they're
dressed."</TE>
<TE>   Once she said yes to the project, Saar was given a choice of three
violins, and she chose one with honey-colored wood. "I love the color
of it," she says, her finger tracing the rim, "and I love this little
trim that goes around it."</TE>
<TE>   The trim is the purfling, a thin, double line of ebony inlay that
reinforces the edges of the violin, but for Saar, it visually helps
to frame her subject.</TE>
<TE>   Within that frame, the orchestra covers most of the violin's back
surface. Saar has added some leaf shapes made of paper to emphasize
the photograph's garden setting, and then given everything a
sienna-toned wash. On one end she has attached a metal fleur-de-lis
and, above the musicians, a new moon made of copper.</TE>
<TE>   "This little crescent moon is one of the images I like to use, for
hope or promise," she says. "It's the new moon in the sky." Finally,
the neck of the violin has been neatly covered with the tooled
leather spine from an old book -- Saar just felt it fit there.</TE>
<TE>   Until the gala, all the violins -- by the six selected artists
(the other three are Linda Nishio, Frank Romero and Erika Rothenberg)
and by Sarah Yates, the LACO associate who thought up the project --
will be on view at the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra's offices or at
galleries throughout Los Angeles, including L.A. Louver, Margo Leavin
and Rosamund Felsen Gallery. Saar's will be at Jan Baum Gallery on La
Brea. For details: (213) 622-7001, Ext. 221. or www.laco.org</TE>

<HD>Warm and fuzzy isn't Cronenberg</HD>
<DH>No exploding heads or creepy crash victims this time around
-- just the terror of memory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Clark</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Cronenberg's newest movie, "Spider," is about a schizophrenic
who is deinstitutionalized, enters a halfway house near his boyhood
home and begins a downward delusional spiral that concludes with him
confronting his demons.</LD>
<LD>   "I do identify with having one suitcase with everything in it,"
Cronenberg says. "I live a pretty simple life." He is referring to
his nicknamed title character's threadbare existence, but it's clear
the director also relates to his outsider status. And, like Spider,
who is played by Ralph Fiennes, he clings to it (though neither seems
to have much choice).</LD>
<LD>   Instead of spending his adult life in a straitjacket, however,
Cronenberg, a Toronto native, has turned heads and stomachs for 25
years by directing a wide variety of offbeat movies. In the process
he's gone from cult favorite to critical and occasionally commercial
success to somewhere in between. In fact, "Spider" is being hailed as
a return to form after the mixed receptions accorded his last four
pictures.</LD>
<TE>   Early in his career, Cronenberg's stock in trade was grotesquely
imaginative, often metaphorical depictions of the ills that the flesh
is heir to. Recently he's operated in more psychological, less
graphic territory, especially in "Spider," though this hasn't made
his movies any more warm and fuzzy. Despite that, or perhaps because
of it, he comes across in conversation as the sanest, most reasonable
man in the room.</TE>
<TE>   "He's kind of Zen," Fiennes says. "I love his lucidity. I love the
way he listens. He's alert to what is coming off of you. Particularly
when you're in character, but as a man he's very acutely alert, he's
very observant, he notices everything and remembers everything."</TE>
<TE>   Memory, and its elusive nature, is the real subject of "Spider,"
which was adapted by Patrick McGrath from his novel. (It opens a
one-week Oscar-qualifying run Dec. 20.) Spider wanders London's East
End, revisiting his childhood in the company of himself as a boy
(Bradley Hall), his father (Gabriel Byrne) and his mother (Miranda
Richardson). As the flashbacks unfold, his father takes up with a
tart (also played by Richardson) who eventually assumes his mother's
role at home. It's not clear if any of this really happened,
especially because in some scenes set in the past both Spiders are
present; if only one is there, it's safe to say the event is a
hallucination.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an examination of how memory works or doesn't work and how
an identity is created from memories but the memories themselves are
a created thing," Cronenberg says. "They're toyed [with], they're
revamped, they're reorganized. Everybody's memories are like that.
Later in your life you're reminiscing about something and your sister
says, 'No, you were too little to realize that, blah, blah, blah.'
And suddenly that memory is completely changed. Or we think we
remember something but we can't remember whether it was told to us so
many times by family members that we think we remember it but we
don't, we remember being told about it. When you then think that a
lot of what we feel that we are is based on our memories, that means
our identity is up for grabs. It's something that it is constantly
under construction."</TE>
<TE>   The price of creativity</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to imagine another major filmmaker tackling such
existential issues. And, of course, Cronenberg had trouble getting
the film made.</TE>
<TE>   It was originally budgeted at $10 million, but the filmmakers
could come up with only $8 million, so Cronenberg, Fiennes,
Richardson, McGrath and the producers all deferred their salaries.
They didn't have the money to pay their English crew in a timely
fashion (the film was shot in England and then Canada) so, according
to Cronenberg, producer Catherine Bailey was left behind in England
as a kind of hostage until the crew got paid.Such difficulties are
nothing new for Cronenberg, even when he's attached to more
commercial projects. He worked for a year on "Total Recall" and wrote
a dozen drafts before moving on (it was eventually directed by Paul
Verhoeven and released in 1990). More recently, he tried to get
"Basic Instinct 2" off the ground but abandoned it when the
threatened writers strike in 2001 prevented him from prepping the
movie properly. One reason pre-production on the film dragged on was
that Cronenberg and star Sharon Stone -- who, despite reports to the
contrary, stood "shoulder to shoulder" on the project, according to
Cronenberg -- couldn't find the right leading man. More to the point,
the studio (C-2 Pictures) insisted on who was hot rather than who was
right.</TE>
<TE>   One of the actors they were interested in, Cronenberg says, "was
Heath Ledger. Now, he was 19 at the time. And this character was
supposed to be a forensic psychiatrist who ends up having a love
affair with Sharon, who, as everybody knows, is over 40. So they were
a little sheepish when we said, 'Will you explain to us how this
19-year-old went through medical school and became a psychiatrist and
had a well-documented career and he's also going to have scenes of
nude lovemaking with Sharon Stone?' "</TE>
<TE>   Cronenberg says that creativity involves a lot of waste -- wasted
time, wasted energy. ("Nature does it too," he says in a typical
analogy. "A spider will lay a thousand eggs and only two of them will
end up being mature spiders.") He was also well aware of what he
signed up for, by which he means that a studio film involves studio
meddling.</TE>
<TE>   His contempt for Hollywood knows no bounds. He complains that
young filmmakers -- and the studios that bankroll them -- are
interested only in other movies, not life, and that when as a young
man he wanted to be Bergman or Fellini, that didn't mean he wanted to
make a Bergman or Fellini movie. (It's safe to say the people he's
talking about aren't aiming so high.) In a way, he's succeeded.
Cronenberg, 59, has created an oeuvre every bit as distinctive as his
heroes'. And he's still as resourceful and opportunistic as those
pathogens he's so lovingly created.</TE>
<TE>   "I assume that if I don't have anything more to say, then I'll
know it," he says. "I don't have a pension the way I work, so I might
have economic reasons for continuing past the point of no return, but
I think I'll know when I've really lost it. But at the moment I'm
still excited. I haven't finished yet."</TE>

<LD>Golden light from a trio of Venetian glass chandeliers spills over
the silk-upholstered walls, drenching a display of Barbizon School
paintings on loan from the Norton Simon Collection. On a wall apart,
a portrait of a woman holds court over the proceedings -- on this
night, a klatch of opera buffs clinking flutes of champagne and
engaging in talk about Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich.</LD>
<LD>   Rarely opened to a reporter or photographer, this is the Founders
Room in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Music Center, for nearly
40 years the city's premier intermission spot. The portrait,
festooned with fresh flowers, is of Dorothy Buffum Chandler, whose
indefatigable fund-raising was the catalyst for the creation of the
center in 1964. "My mother saw the room as a necessary adjunct to the
Music Center but not self-congratulatory in any way," says former Los
Angeles Times publisher Otis Chandler. "I think it's an elegant room,
a gracious, functional room for people who enjoy the arts."</LD>
<LD>   "The essence of Buff Chandler is here -- the room reeks of her
persona and presence," says Founders Room member Ginny Mancini. "It
is a room full of warmth and welcome, like Buff herself."</LD>
<TE>   Warmth, yes, but welcome only to major donors and their friends.
Like the posh chambers reserved for arts benefactors on the East
Coast -- the Metropolitan Opera in New York has its Board and Eleanor
Belmont rooms, the John F. Kennedy Center in Washington its Golden
Circle -- the Founders Room is where donors of $75,000 and up prove
that giving well is the best revenge. While most theatergoers queue
up in the lobby during intermission to sip drinks from plastic and
scramble for a vacant chair, members toss down preordered cocktails
and settle onto plush velvet sofas. The room even boasts two women's
bathrooms -- a perk so convenient that "they alone are worth the
admission price," one member confides.</TE>
<TE>   "Mrs. Chandler had this wonderful idea of having a room that
everyone could see when they left the [second-level] elevator," says
Robert Willoughby Jones, who managed the space in the '90s. "She
wanted wives to tell their husbands, 'I don't care what it costs --
we have to belong here!' "</TE>
<TE>   The two-story, 3,000-square-foot sanctuary has been an "effective
fund-raising tool," says Richard Owens, the center's vice president
of advancement. Access to the room has been a major incentive for
donations to the center and its resident companies -- the Los Angeles
Philharmonic, Center Theatre Group, Los Angeles Opera and Master
Chorale. In addition to the required donation, the 1,500 active
members pay annual dues of $500.</TE>
<TE>   This is a room where heads are not easily turned, where, on a
recent night, Los Angeles Opera artistic director Placido Domingo and
his wife, Marta, converse sotto voce with opera buffs such as
Patricia Kelly, wife of the late actor Gene Kelly. "This room has the
excitement of a feeding tank. At intermission, you jump right in,
chat with friends, meet people, chat with people you are in awe of,"
Kelly says. "It's a little lagniappe for the evening."</TE>
<TE>   Champagne, cappuccino and cocktails are served at the opulent
verde marble bar. Bowls of salted nuts and trays of fancy cookies sit
on the room's chic Chinoiserie tables, and, with a reservation,
members can enjoy dinner before the curtain goes up. "We try to
extend a feeling of appreciation to our members," says Elba Smith,
the room's executive director. "That means providing a friendly
environment -- from the service to the ambience, from the drinks to
the food." Formalities are downplayed, the only steadfast rule being
that "men must wear jackets," Smith says. (She has a dozen hanging in
a closet, should someone forget.) Gate-crashers are few. "People are
generally respectful of our sign that says it's for members," she
says.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County,  donors of $100,000 and up to the Performing
Arts Center in Costa Mesa spend intermissions in the Center Room.
Amid walls displaying 3rd century Syrian mosaics on loan from the J.
Paul Getty Museum, they sip cocktails on cushy banquettes and pick at
chocolates served on marble tables. "This space is special to me,"
says donor Michele Rohe. "It's a beautiful spot where I can relax and
talk with friends."</TE>
<TE>   Both arts centers have additional donor rooms on their drawing
boards, with another Founders Room -- this one with skylight, garden
and private elevator -- to be housed in the Walt Disney Concert Hall,
and a yet-to-be-named private space planned for the new Renee and
Henry Segerstrom Concert Hall. The Music Center has no plans to up
the ante for access to its new space at the Disney, Owens says: "It
will be available to Founders' members across campus." And while
existing Center Room donors will be able to use the new space, new
donors will pay more. "We haven't decided on the amount yet, but it
will be significantly more," says center President Jerry Mandel. "Now
is the time to join."</TE>

<HD>The art of the release</HD>
<DH>Box-office and awards calculations often result in limited
openings.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Studios bring out movies in a variety of ways during the holiday
season. The nationwide releases bombard us with TV ads and talk-show
appearances by their stars as they vie for the instant hit, but for
more specialized films, the ones seeking Oscar glory and the
ancillary lucre, it's a little tougher to clarify when they are
coming to a theater near you.</LD>
<LD>   Many films take a strictly traditional path, opening in a few
major markets before expanding. In some cases these patterns are
carefully dictated by marketing departments adhering to formulas that
have succeeded in the past. Others add theaters based on their
box-office performance and as critics awards are announced throughout
December, the Golden Globe nominations Dec. 19 and the Holy Grail,
the nominations for the Academy Awards, on Feb. 11.</LD>
<LD>   A variation on this are films that open first in select New York
theaters, followed by a similar L.A. release and subsequent expansion
to more screens and other markets. Other films play New York and L.A.
exclusively for a week or two, sometimes only in one theater, to be
Oscar-eligible before disappearing and resurfacing early the next
year. Recent examples of films that took this tack and garnered major
Academy Awards were "Pollock" (Marcia Gay Harden for best supporting
actress) two years ago and "Sling Blade" (Billy Bob Thornton for best
adapted screenplay) in 1996.</LD>
<TE>   Generally, as a film expands to larger markets nationwide, its
local release follows a similar pattern reaching beyond the art
houses to suburban multiplexes.</TE>
<TE>   Platform to heaven: "Far From Heaven" opened Nov. 15, expanded
Nov. 22 and is currently in about 300 theaters, looking to add as the
awards season heats up. "Rabbit-Proof Fence," currently in limited
release, expands to the top 40 markets Dec. 25. "Adaptation" opened
Friday, expands Dec. 20 and goes wide Jan. 10. "About Schmidt" opens
this Friday, expands to the top 15 markets on Dec. 20 and goes wide
Jan. 3. "Evelyn" opens in five markets on Dec. 13, expanding
gradually in the following weeks. "Antwone Fisher" opens Dec. 20 in
limited release, expanding on Dec. 25 and Jan. 1. "25th Hour" opens
in L.A. and New York on Dec. 19, expanding to the top 60 markets on
Jan. 10. "Narc" opens Dec. 20 and goes wide Jan. 10. "Chicago" opens
Dec. 27 in L.A. and New York and goes wide on Jan. 10. "The Hours"
opens in five cities on Dec. 27, expands on Jan. 10 and goes wide
Jan. 17. "Max" opens Dec. 27 in L.A. and New York and expands Jan.
24. "Nicholas Nickleby" opens in L.A. and New York on Dec. 27,
expands Jan. 3 and goes wide Jan. 10. "The Pianist" opens Dec. 27 in
L.A. and New York, expanding throughout January. "Love Liza" opens
Dec. 30 and platforms through January. "Confessions of a Dangerous
Mind" opens Dec. 31 and expands Jan. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Apple-fied mathematics: "Talk to Her" opened Nov. 22 in New York
and opens Friday in L.A. "Intacto" opens Friday in New York, Dec. 23
in L.A. and expands to the top 25 markets on Jan. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Now you see it, now you don't: "The Quiet American" debuted Nov.
22 for a two-week qualifying run and will return Jan. 10, expanding
to the top 20 markets Feb. 7 and the top 60 markets Feb. 14. "The
Guys" opens Dec. 13 for one week, then returns to L.A. and New York
on Valentine's Day and opens the following week in additional
markets. "Spider" starts a one-week Oscar qualifying run Dec. 20 and
returns Feb. 28.</TE>

<HD>A New York state of mind</HD>
<DH>Think hip-hop radio is the same wherever you turn? A recent
transplant to the Southland says it's not so.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Baz Dreisinger</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm cruising down Wilshire, Snoop blaring on the radio, when my
friend Ben calls from Brooklyn.</LD>
<LD>   "The latest Nas track is the jam. Heard it?" he asks.</LD>
<LD>   "Nope. They're not playing it out here."</LD>
<TE>   I sigh. And Ben sighs, with some disgust and much pity. He knows
my state: I'm a New Yorker in exile. A Bronx-raised hip-hop fan
exiled from New York radio.</TE>
<TE>   You, musical snob, are having two thoughts. First, who but musical
dilettantes listen to radio anyway? And second, how can "radio exile"
exist when hip-hop is the national soundtrack, when listeners from
Pittsburgh to Sioux City to San Fran are supposedly jamming to the
same 10 commercial tracks?</TE>
<TE>   Eschewing such snobbery, I hereby "out" myself as a radio
listener. It's the aural diet of the masses -- and with all my
musical conceit I am, after all, one of the masses. As for haters who
moan that radio is monopolized by one playlist, I question your
attention to subtlety. If I've learned one thing since moving from
N.Y. to L.A. in October, it's that listening to hip-hop radio is not
an identical experience in every city. Adjusting to life among the
Angels, I'm discovering, includes setting my day to a new soundtrack.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the soundtrack includes some ubiquitous radio tracks, ones
that harass our ears from coast to coast: Nelly and Kelly's
"Dilemma," Eve and Alicia's "Gangsta Loving," anything by Eminem,
anything featuring even a half-second vocal by Ashanti. Some such
tracks are actually worth their weight in spins: Missy's "Work It,"
Erick Sermon and Redman's "React," even that anthem for whiteboy
flava, Justin Timberlake's "Like I Love You."</TE>
<TE>   But, to use an apt L.A. metaphor, if these must-plays are a
station's protein, its carbohydrates are the old standards, the songs
that fill gaps between New Jam and Newer Jam. They're much-beloved
background music, or radio's musical wallpaper.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, this wallpaper is undeniably East Coast: tracks by
Nas, Jay-Z, Noreaga, Notorious B.I.G. Oldies by Rakim, Pete Rock,
Slick Rick. Nowadays, I can hardly tune in to one of New York's three
mainstream hip-hop stations -- Hot 97, Power 105 and WBLS -- without
hearing, say, 50 Cent's "Wanksta" or Erykah Badu and Common's "Love
of My Life." I haven't tired of these songs yet.</TE>
<TE>   I haven't had the chance to -- since I rarely hear them on L.A.
radio. 100.3 the Beat and Power 106 are wallpapered in Snoop, Dre,
Xzibit, WC, Nate Dogg (who might as well add "featuring" to his
title, since he shows up in WC's "The Streets," Shade Sheist's "Wake
Up" and Xzibit's "Multiply"). Without rehashing East-versus-West
rhetoric, I'll say that the laid-back groove of local hip-hop reigns
on airwaves here.</TE>
<TE>   This, I realize, is not necessarily bad. Though I've been Jay-Z
deficient since my exodus from Manhattan to Miracle Mile, I've also
escaped such irksome tracks as "If I Could Go," by New York DJ Angie
Martinez (who, thankfully, isn't given much airtime here). Instead,
Mack 10 and Westside Connection's "Connected for Life," a hot track I
missed out on back East, is now my car stereo's jam of the week.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings me to the fact that I, like everyone else I know,
never had a car stereo in New York. I got my hip-hop radio
peripatetically: Strolling down Broadway or 125th Street, we hear
hometown MCs blaring out of bodegas and open windows. These rappers
become our neighbors. When we catch walk-by snippets of their rhymes
-- even rhymes about rims we can't use or Cristal we can't afford --
it's as if they're right here on the block, partying with us.</TE>
<TE>   In L.A., radio listening is obviously not a pedestrian activity.
This means certain tracks that didn't quite do it for me on a New
York street -- like WC and Nate Dogg's "The Streets," or Roscoe's
"Get Ready" -- suddenly come alive now that I'm behind the wheel. It
also means that I hear more than song snippets now, and that during
rush hour, when we're a captive audience, DJs really work for their
dollars: I give it to Adimu and DJ Dense on the Beat, and Mr. Choc on
Power 106, for their tight mixes, for pulling out old, new and
neither-old-nor-new jams. (How sweet it is that N.O.R.E.'s "Nothin' "
and Truth Hurts' "Addictive," all but retired in New York, are still
on playlists here.)</TE>
<TE>   For all you "backpackers" -- underground hip-hop fans who are
looking down their noses at every track and station I've mentioned
thus far -- I concede that, yes, L.A. radio treats you better than
does New York radio. Though my radio tastes are on the populist side,
I am impressed that mainstream DJs here, such as Felli Fel, are
playing Jurassic 5's "What's Golden," and that KCRW's Garth Trinidad,
KPFK's Fidel Rodriguez and KXLU's Mike Nardone spin Dilated Peoples
and Black Money Manglers to a hard-core fan base.</TE>
<TE>   But while we're talking diversity of styles, though I've heard
house, rock-rap melanges, even Latin rap on hip-hop radio here,
where's the reggae? Thank goodness for the Beat's Dredd and Barbara
B., and KPFK's Chuck Foster -- but can't we wind to a little
dancehall outside a specialty show? Yes, Sean Paul's "Gimme the
Light" is a killer track, and I'm glad L.A. radio finally discovered
it, but there's more where it came from. How about spinning, say,
Wayne Wonder's "No Letting Go," which is lighting up N.Y. stations?</TE>
<TE>   And for my final New York-style kvetch, I make another request.
Because L.A. is an industry town, where no one wants to step on
anyone's toes (or screenplay), radio DJs seem too, well, pleasant.
Their good cheer leaves me homesick for the attitude-slinging,
hate-loving DJs of New York hip-hop radio. Bring on the raw nastiness
of New York's Star and BucWild, or the gruff bark of Funkmaster Flex!
Because in the end I side with Biggie Smalls: "If I got to choose a
coast, I got to choose the East." But while I "rest in the West," I
still love to turn my radio up.</TE>

<HD>Psychology as a short subject</HD>
<DH>Hollywood's seeming disinterest in character studies has
left plots plagued by shallowness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephen Farber</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At this late date, probably no one will be surprised to hear that
Freud's image has been more than a little tarnished. Anti-Freudian
tomes continue to tumble off the presses; scholars and critics who
were once in thrall to psychoanalysis now vilify the old dogma with
the fury of religious converts. In the treatment of psychiatric
patients, drug therapy has replaced the "talking cure," which
expected patients to pore over their childhood wounds on a rigorous
journey to understanding. And in Hollywood, the cinematic shrink du
jour is not the wise, all-knowing analyst enshrined in movies such as
"Spellbound" or "Ordinary People," but the flesh-eating madman Dr.
Hannibal Lecter.</LD>
<LD>   Some of this questioning of psychoanalytic orthodoxy is long
overdue: For years, doctors and pundits relied on simplistic slogans
to explain the stubborn mysteries of character. But in the effort to
overthrow old pieties, we may have gone too far in the opposite
direction. One unfortunate result of the anti-Freudian revolution is
that it has contributed to the wholesale elimination of in-depth
character exploration in movies. I'm not talking here about action
extravaganzas with cartoon characters. The more disturbing phenomenon
is that movies ostensibly intended to be character-driven also turn
out to be surprisingly flat.</LD>
<TE>   When a psychological viewpoint pervaded the culture, filmmakers
provided rich character dramas as diverse as "All About Eve," "The
Hustler," "Lawrence of Arabia," "Bonnie and Clyde," and "The
Conversation," to name just a few. What's striking about so many of
today's movies is not just that they're much shallower than those
classic studies of complex characters, but also that they're
intentionally shallow. Pictures like "Punch-Drunk Love," "Auto
Focus," "Frida," "Secretary," "Man on the Moon" and "Pollock"
deliberately shun any piercing psychological dissection of their
troubled protagonists. One might call these movies defiantly
anti-psychological, and they're created by some of our hippest
filmmakers, who seem to believe that anything resembling a
psychiatric approach to character would be hopelessly archaic.
Unfortunately, without that psychological dimension, there's a gaping
hole in these movies.</TE>
<TE>   It's understandable that filmmakers want to avoid the psychobabble
that sometimes ruined the earnest Freudian movies of the past. Even a
sharp recent film, "One Hour Photo," falls victim to this crude
expository impulse. The movie is utterly compelling up until the
moment when it "explains" Robin Williams' psychosis by disclosing his
own childhood molestation. The revelation seems reductive and false
to the creepy, hauntingly mysterious character created earlier in the
film.</TE>
<TE>   Unexplored territory</TE>
<TE>   Although such a neat summary of a complicated personality can seem
fraudulent, a stubbornly anti-psychological slant is no more
satisfying. Consider Paul Schrader's "Auto Focus," which has been
highly praised but remains a relentlessly superficial study of TV
nonentity Bob Crane, who went from gee-whiz family man to randy
swinger during the course of a few years in the '60s. The film
observes his startling transformation from the outside but doesn't
elucidate it. Despite Greg Kinnear's brave and magnetic performance,
the movie tells us nothing about Crane that would help us to
understand why he toppled into a far more extreme form of sexual
addiction than many of his flower-child cohorts.</TE>
<TE>   Schrader's earlier movies, from "Taxi Driver" to "Affliction,"
have evinced a more searing investigation of tormented characters, so
perhaps the skin-deep strategy of "Auto Focus" is attributable to the
screenwriter, Michael Gerbosi, and two of the movie's producers,
Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. Alexander and Karaszewski
wrote three earlier biographical pictures -- "Ed Wood," "The People
vs. Larry Flynt," and "Man on the Moon" (a biography of another TV
star, Andy Kaufman) -- that took a similar anti-psychological
approach to their real-life subjects. Their tactic in those movies is
simply to present a bizarre oddball without trying to suggest what
makes him tick.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Taymor's visually striking "Frida" takes an external
approach to the biopic. It ticks off many of the incidents in Frida
Kahlo's life, but it doesn't delve into her psyche or the dynamic of
her volatile relationship with Diego Rivera. Why was Kahlo drawn to
this notorious womanizer? Why did she endure his deceit and
infidelity? And on the other side, what were the reasons for Rivera's
promiscuity? The film refuses to speculate, apparently on the
misguided theory that anyscrutiny would invade the artist's privacy.</TE>
<TE>   These biographies aren't the only recent films to confuse
sophistication with psychological shallowness. Paul Thomas Anderson's
"Punch-Drunk Love" starts out as an intriguing character study of
Barry Egan (Adam Sandler), a social misfit overpowered by seven
domineering sisters. They relentlessly control and belittle him, and
his response is to alternate between abject servility and outbursts
of rage. These opening scenes are evocative, but it quickly becomes
clear that Anderson isn't really interested in burrowing into the
mind of the maladjusted character he's introduced.</TE>
<TE>   In one of these early scenes, Barry asks his brother-in-law if he
can recommend a psychiatrist, and most neutral observers would say
that this guy is in desperate need of one. But to Anderson, the idea
of psychotherapy is a joke, because he has no intention of plumbing
Barry's anguish. The movie abandons any pretense of psychological
realism once Barry begins a romance with a sister's friend (Emily
Watson). What would motivate her to pursue him so avidly? Anderson
offers no hint as to the perverse tendencies that might draw her to
someone so dangerous and disturbed.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever else you might say about Freudian theory, it was a
supremely logical reading of the dark mysteries of human nature.
Anderson's movie, by contrast, wallows in illogic and brutal
sensationalism. Maybe that was his intention, part of some half-baked
existentialist credo. But it's also possible that he and his hip
cohorts avoid psychoanalyzing unstable characters because they simply
don't have the ability to penetrate unconscious motivations and
hidden drives.</TE>
<TE>   Happy exceptions</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, these aren't the only types of movies in the
marketplace. There are some bright, savvy filmmakers who still
respect a meticulous, analytical approach to character. "The
Sopranos," which is deeply in thrall to psychoanalysis, remains one
of the best dramas on television.</TE>
<TE>   The unjustly maligned "Abandon," written and directed by Stephen
Gaghan (the Oscar-winning writer of "Traffic"), is a smart
psychological thriller that draws us into the cunning yet troubled
mind of a woman (Katie Holmes) unhinged by a series of primal
betrayals. And "8 Mile" pays serious attention to the family dynamic
that contributes to the anger of the embattled, insecure Rabbit
(Eminem). Screenwriter Scott Silver and director Curtis Hanson expose
the character's psychological scars as well as his animal energy. The
ending, in which he finally acknowledges his own history in his
improvised rap taunt, is actually a classic psychoanalytic moment: A
young man breaks free of his oppressive past by accepting and even
embracing the personal demons that drive him.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas "Punch-Drunk Love" titillates us with the hero's family
turmoil, only to dismiss it as an irrelevant joke, "8 Mile" sees that
family background as absolutely crucial to understanding the
character.</TE>
<TE>   Call me old-fashioned, but I'd say movies desperately need more of
this astute psychological analysis and a lot less of the gaudy
pyrotechnics and glib, absurdist spectacle that pass for postmodern
profundity.</TE>

<LD>Catherine Leroy came up with the idea for "Under Fire"
(www.pieceuniquegallery.com) in January of this year, she says. She
believes the images she has assembled are defining moments of the
20th century, and new technology allows her to reprint and sell them
at relatively modest prices.</LD>
<LD>   Although a vintage Vietnam print by Tim Page might sell for $1,400
at auction in Paris, Page says, Leroy is offering the same image
through her online gallery for between $160 and $460, depending on
the size and whether it's framed. Pricing is the same for all of the
works on the site, and all are archival Pictopia prints, which
ensures longevity and fine quality.</LD>
<LD>   For the photographers -- Leroy, Page, David Burnett, Larry
Burrows, Gilles Caron, Robert Ellison, Dirck Halstead, Henri Huet,
Don McCullin, Dana Stone and Dick Swanson -- it's a new way to get
the work out there, and for the surviving ones, a way to earn income.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a way to put more steam on the table," Page says.</TE>
<TE>   Marc Leepson, arts editor and a columnist for the VVA Veteran, a
bimonthly magazine from the Vietnam Veterans of America, says it will
publish one image from the site per issue for the next several
months, accompanied by texts by the great writers of the era. The
first paired a photograph by McCullin with an essay by Philip Caputo.
In the November-December issue, Jack Smith writes about an Henri Huet
photograph.</TE>
<TE>   Leroy proposed the project to the magazine, recommended by Vietnam
reporter Gloria Emerson. "We had not heard of Catherine Leroy,"
Leepson says, "even though we have a fair knowledge of the field of
Vietnam photographers." Leepson, a Vietnam veteran who receives about
20 books a month on the war for review, says he was happy to discover
work he hadn't known before. The Web site, he says, is "extremely
well done. She has chosen very high-quality photographs. They're
fantastic images."</TE>

<HD>A window on the war</HD>
<DH>Catherine Leroy is one of the band of fearless freelance
photographers who brought home the action in Vietnam.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Freudenheim</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Marine hunches over the body of his fallen comrade, both hands on
the wounded man's chest -- giving comfort, checking for a heartbeat
or stanching the flow of blood. A cigarette, burned almost to the
filter, remains clenched between his teeth, left over from the peace
of a moment ago. His gun still in its holster across his back, he
looks up through the mesh of tall grass that hides the enemy. His
eyes are thick with fear, anger, defiance. Below, the wounded man
touches his rescuer's arm, face turned up, lips open. He may be
talking. Who knows now?</LD>
<LD>   This scene was recorded in Vietnam in 1967 by Catherine Leroy, in
a photograph that evokes all that is ugly and heroic in war. Leroy
snapped the image lying on her stomach in an overgrown rice paddy
near the Demilitarized Zone, where she, too, was hiding from the
enemy. In as much danger as the men she was traveling with, she did
not stop for fear. She was a photojournalist, and it was her job to
crawl into the action and document it.</LD>
<TE>   In an age when technology has allowed Americans to fight their
wars from a distance, Leroy, a petite Frenchwoman who risked her life
on the front lines, is here to remind us what ground combat really
looks like. In her early 20s she bore witness to the death of
American idealism in Vietnam, shooting photo after photo of bloody
battles in which dying men fought to save their dignity in the face
of unrelenting misery. More than three decades later, Leroy's
photographs show us that war is not comfortable. It is unbearably sad
and becomes heroic only in the retelling. The rawness of her imagery
is shocking, an in-your-face truth that came of access to action the
U.S. military now deftly keeps off limits to journalists.</TE>
<TE>   Disseminating images of the Vietnam conflict has become an
obsession for Leroy, and to that end she has created a Web site,
"Under Fire: Images From Vietnam" (www.pieceuniquegallery.com). The
site offers for sale Leroy's classic works, along with those of 10 of
her friends and colleagues -- among them revered Vietnam
photographers Tim Page, Henri Huet, Gilles Caron and Dick Swanson.
The images are supplemented by biographical material and interviews,
either with the photographer or, in the case of those who died on the
job, with friends and co-workers. Links to other Web sites direct
visitors to histories of the era, late '60s rock recordings, updates
on current Vietnam veterans' issues and more. A portion of the
proceeds from sales on the site will be donated to the Vietnam
Veterans Assistance Fund.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at war photographs," Leroy says in her thick French
accent, "it's a silent moment of eternity. But for me, it is haunted
by sound, a deafening sound." For her, the soldier with the cigarette
triggers a memory of sudden fire, men screaming, the sensation of
crawling forward on her elbows to a man who had been walking just a
few feet ahead. "In Vietnam, most of the time it was extremely
boring. Exhausting and boring. You walked for miles through rice
paddies or jungle -- walking, crawling, in the most unbearable
circumstances. And nothing was happening. And then suddenly all hell
would break loose."</TE>
<TE>   As she speaks, she gestures with her hands, eyes fixed on her
listener but also focused on a long ago picture in her mind that
seems just as real today. There is a passion to her language as she
speaks of this era. A passion that won't go away with time.</TE>
<TE>   A VARIED CAREER</TE>
<TE>   Vietnam, as Leroy lived it from the spring of 1966 to early 1969,
was a war shot live for all to see. Her pictures -- close up,
emotional -- were widely published at the time in newspapers and
pictorial magazines, and in 1967 she won the George Polk Award for
news photography.</TE>
<TE>   An active freelancer, she went on to shoot battles in Northern
Ireland, Cyprus and Lebanon, winning the Robert Capa Award in 1976
for her work there. She has covered war, but like most photographers
she's run the gamut, from fashion and celebrities to projects she
holds dear, such as one on Mohawk Indian "skywalkers," the legendary
ironworkers who build skyscrapers. She also was director and
cinematographer of "The Last Patrol" (1972), a film about
vet-activist Ron Kovic, and collaborated with Newsweek correspondent
Tony Clifton on "God Cried" (Quartet Books, 1983), a book about the
civil war in Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   These days Leroy is mostly out of the "snapping business," as Page
calls it. She lives in a modest apartment on the Westside of Los
Angeles, where she spends most of her days running Piece Unique, a
consignment business offering vintage haute couture through another,
very different Web site she created in 1997 (www.pieceunique.com).
This foray into fashion has satisfied a lifelong connoisseurship of
fine clothing and provided an escape from years of jumping in where
others might step back.</TE>
<TE>   The unusual range of Leroy's undertakings speaks to her layered
character, which she reveals only slowly, over time. At 58, she is
immediately striking. She dresses with flair, even in her more casual
moments -- an Hermes scarf, a heavy bracelet by Robert Goossens, who
once worked for Coco Chanel. Her throaty "bonjour" sounds today as if
she'd never left her comfortable bourgeois childhood home in Paris.
Decades of international hopping around disappear with a trio of air
kisses.</TE>
<TE>   She came of age as a Catholic boarding school girl with wild
ideas. She'd trained as a classical pianist but wanted only to play
jazz, and, reading Paris Match each week, she dreamed of nothing more
than becoming a photojournalist. She also had a bit of experience in
jumping from airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   As Leroy tells it, when she was 18 her boyfriend was a
parachutist, and she learned to impress him by jumping too. Five feet
tall and 85 pounds, she didn't offer much ballast, but she did it
often enough to earn a license, which she took with her to Vietnam in
the spring of 1966, when she was 21. She quickly made her way to the
desk of Horst Faas, a photographer for the Associated Press who also
served as editor for legions of photojournalists filing out of
Saigon. She admitted to her lack of experience. He told her to go do
some work. Undaunted, she did.</TE>
<TE>   "I was making $15 a photograph," she says. "There was a great
appetite for this work."</TE>
<TE>   As a woman, she was rare among photojournalists but not entirely
alone. And she firmly states that her experience among all those
soldiers was completely without overtones of sexuality or gender
biases. "My size 6 foot was swimming in my size 7 jungle boots, the
smallest they had," she says. "There was nothing sexy about me."</TE>
<TE>   She mentions incidents that others might make more of -- such as
that she was the only journalist to jump with the 173rd Airborne
during Operation Junction City, on Feb. 22, 1967. The commanding
officer, General John R. Deane, had suggested several months before
that she seek credentials, which she easily obtained through Military
Assistance Command Vietnam because of her license from her teen
years. Two days before the jump, she was told to report to the 173rd
headquarters. She was, she remembers, the seventh to jump from the
seventh plane. She shot photos from the air, which AP sent out. "I'm
very proud of myself because I didn't jump into a tree," she says
with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   But later that spring, she was injured. On May 19, Leroy went on
patrol with a marine unit in the DMZ. In the middle of a wide-open
rice paddy, she was hit in an ambush by mortar fire. Thirty-five
pieces of shrapnel pierced her body, her jaw was broken and her
cameras destroyed. In fact, she believes it was a camera hanging from
her neck that saved her life. Because they were in a "hot zone," she
and the other injured had to be evacuated by tank instead of
helicopter, driven to base camp at Con Thien and flown from there to
Dong Ha. In six weeks, Leroy was back in the field.</TE>
<TE>   She was captured, too. In early 1968, Leroy was on holiday at
China Beach when the Tet Offensive began: "I had brought my bikini
and my cameras. I had everything. As fate had it, I never got to use
the bikini." She and a French journalist made their way to Hue, where
they "heard there was action." They spent the night in a cathedral
full of refugees, but were asked to leave the next morning because
the refugees were afraid of having foreigners among them. They left
knowing they would be captured. "Five or six men, all carrying guns,
jumped on us, took my camera, tied our hands behind our backs," she
says. They were taken to an occupied colonial home, where they were
held in the servants' quarters.</TE>
<TE>   To their surprise and relief, a North Vietnamese colonel, "about
the same age as us," decided to return their gear and allowed Leroy
to take photographs and interview him and his soldiers. "It was an
extraordinary experience for me," she says. "I had seen many North
Vietnamese prisoners, but they were always in great fear and great
pain. This was the first time, suddenly, that their humanity was in
front of me." The resulting essay, which she sent to her agency,
Black Star, earned Leroy a byline cover story in Life magazine, on
Feb. 16, 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Leroy tells her stories bluntly, without bragging. She does not
believe that following soldiers into the field was courageous. "I
always felt that it was a great privilege to be with the soldiers,"
she says. "To be accepted, to spend a couple of days or maybe a week
with them. But I could leave any time, and they couldn't. Within 48
hours I would be in Saigon, have a long shower and rest. I would be
in a French restaurant where the food was nice, where the wine was
decent, and I always felt guilty inside. To me, it was as if I was a
deserter. Which is a bit ridiculous, but it's true."</TE>
<TE>   'DOGGED PERSEVERANCE'</TE>
<TE>   Tim Page, a daredevil himself who saw more than his share of
action and was severely wounded as well, remembers Leroy's gumption.
"She's a tiny mouche, a mosquito-like person, he says. "She had this
dogged perseverance. She was always popping up with a picture."</TE>
<TE>   Although there were as many as 600 journalists in Vietnam at its
height, Page says, the group of freelance photographers was small,
maybe 20 or 30 at any given time. "There was enough work to go
around," he says. There was also "fearsome competition" among them,
although camaraderie prevailed too and endures to this day.
Photographers would carry one another's film in from the field and
file for one another. There was a tremendous respect for the work,
agrees David Burnett, another photographer represented on the "Under
Fire" site.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a legend, and I had heard about her. I wanted to do a
story on Catherine Leroy," says Gloria Emerson, who covered the
Vietnam War for the New York Times and has since written extensively
about it. "One was struck by how tiny she looked. Size is not
important, but she looked like a Peter Pan child. I have a photograph
taken by Larry Burrows of GIs taking a wounded man by holding on to
his clothing. They were rushing, and there were no gurneys or
stretchers. And Catherine is in the background, dancing around. It's
really remarkable how much combat she saw."</TE>
<TE>   The story most often circulated about Leroy is one she doesn't
readily bring up, although she will talk about it when asked. Not
long after she jumped with the 173rd, she was eager to jump again,
and, seeing a small group of Marines climbing into a helicopter with
parachutes, she asked if she could join them. "I said, 'Oh, I'd love
to go with you.' Things were as simple as that." The officer arrived,
she made her request again, and he told her no. It didn't stop there.
Leroy, wearing her wings from her earlier jump, insisted that she was
qualified. The officer was condescending to her, she believes, and
she responded in kind. "I became disagreeable," she says
euphemistically, "and it escalated. It was ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   The story has become somewhat apocryphal, and different versions
abound. Most agree that she swore at the officer. Some have heard she
kicked him. (She firmly denies the latter.) Nevertheless, the officer
reported her, and her press privileges were temporarily suspended.
"He was extremely arrogant," she says. "Supposedly I was banned for
six months, but I don't remember that even happening. It's very hard
to fight the official version, but I never left the country."</TE>
<TE>   Joseph B. Treaster, a New York Times reporter who covered the war
in Vietnam, suggests that the incident may have escalated because,
despite the commonplace nature of profanity in a war zone, Marines
did not like hearing such language from a woman. He adds, too, that
having one's press credential suspended was not generally regarded as
a sign of impropriety, as more than one journalist was sanctioned
simply for diligent reporting.</TE>
<TE>   There is no question that Leroy's foremost desire was to get the
story. Robert G. Brown, a now-retired businessman who served in the
U.S. Marine Corps from 1966 to 1969, was wounded that day in May
alongside Leroy. He remembers her unrelenting determination to be in
the action, although at the time, along with many of his military
colleagues, he saw journalists as a strange breed: "When I think of
her, I wonder what makes a person do what she did. Reporters and
photographers, I guess, are strange people in a sense. I first
thought that she might be a little crazy for wanting to be in
Vietnam, and I even thought that she had to be stupid. But that's not
it at all. She is far from either one, but there is something that
drives these people."</TE>

<TE>   Trumpeter Botti's burgeoning career as a solo artist calls up a
distinct echo of Chet Baker. With his similarly (although blond
rather than dark-haired) matinee-idol good looks, his warm and
affecting trumpet sound, and his laid-back, intimate vocals, Botti
would seem to have the credentials for a significant breakout. In
this collection, he sings two songs -- "Have Yourself a Merry Little
Christmas" and a lovely new number, "Perfect Day," by Richard and
Cynthia Marx -- and applies his silken trumpet tone and lyrical
phrasing to classics ranging from "The Christmas Song" to "Silent
Night."</TE>
<TE>   The Gypsy Hombres</TE>
<TE>   "Django Bells" (Memphis Intl.)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   Who are these guys? If you can believe it, they're from Nashville,
a free-floating trio led by violinist Peter Hyrka, here accompanied
by guitarist Justin Thompson and bassist David Spicher. The implied
connection, of course, is to Django Reinhardt, Stephane Grappelli and
the Hot Club of France. And there are passages in which these players
call up some distinctly swinging, Parisian resonances. More often,
their jaunty rhythms more closely resemble Bob Wills &amp; the Texas
Playboys, enhanced by a sense of humor that delivers "Rudolph the
Red-Nosed Reindeer" as a tango, starts "Here Comes Santa Claus" with
the phrasing of a Bach violin sonata and kicks off "You're a Mean
One, Mr. Grinch" with the famous thematic motif from "Dragnet."</TE>
<TE>   Warren Hill</TE>
<TE>   "A Warren Hill Christmas" (Narada Jazz)</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Smooth-jazz alto saxophonist Hill starts out his holiday set in
surprisingly spare fashion, playing "Frosty the Snowman," "Santa
Baby" and "White Christmas" in classic, straight-ahead settings.
Unfortunately, the balance of the program soon shifts into the
predictable, drum machine-like rhythms and synthesizer textures so
common to smooth jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Tyrell</TE>
<TE>   "This Time of the Year" (Columbia)</TE>
<TE>   **</TE>
<TE>   Listening to Tyrell's assemblage of Christmas songs is a bit like
opening a gift box and finding that it contains a not particularly
convincing knockoff of an Armani necktie. Tyrell is surrounded by a
sterling group of players, and the arrangements by co-producer and
guitarist Bob Mann, establish the sort of briskly swinging groove
associated with Frank Sinatra-Nelson Riddle recordings. But Tyrell is
no Sinatra. Or even Dean Martin, for that matter. Despite the
enthusiasm constantly present in his singing, the album ultimately
suffers from his narrow interpretive range.</TE>
<TE>   Ella Fitzgerald</TE>
<TE>   "Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas" (Verve)</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Recorded in 1960, when Fitzgerald was 43 and very much at the
height of her powers, this reissue is a definitive example of an
artist who could cross over to the pop market without sacrificing an
iota of her jazz skills. Arrangements by Frank DeVol frame her
readings in the upbeat, rhythmically mellow style characteristic of
the late '50s and early '60s, and Fitzgerald is as crisp and swinging
on "Jingle Bells" as she is warm and supple on "The Christmas Song."</TE>
<TE>   Various artists</TE>
<TE>   "Santa's Greatest Hits"</TE>
<TE>   (Varese Sarabande)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   This one's for fun. The tracks come from every imaginable source,
including World War II V-discs and period radio broadcasts. And the
selections are amazingly diverse: Eartha Kitt's wittily sensual
"Santa Baby," Count Basie's "I Want to See Santa Claus (Good Morning
Blues)" (with a Jimmy Rushing vocal ), Stan Kenton's "Ride On Santa,
Ride On" (sung by June Christy), Louis Armstrong's "Zat You Santa
Claus?," Louis Prima's "What Will Santa Claus Say" and Louis Jordan's
"Santa Claus, Santa Claus."</TE>

<HD>Please welcome the Freshman Class of 2002</HD>
<DH>They may have just arrived on the scene, but they're
destined to be around for quite a while.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Hilburn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lure of new pop acts isn't based solely on what they have already
given us, but the prospect that they can continue enchanting us for
years. Calendar's annual Freshman Class is a salute to 2002's new
arrivals who best reflect the individuality, passion and craft that
make them seem promising for the long run. The list is alphabetical.</LD>
<LD>   And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead. This explosive Texas
art-punk outfit punctuates its dark, apocalyptic tales with a
whiplash force that is gloriously therapeutic. Album: "Source Tags &amp;
Code" (Interscope).</LD>
<LD>   Cee-Lo. Singer-rapper Thomas Callaway (a.k.a. Cee-Lo) incorporates
elements of soul, gospel and funk in his music so convincingly that
you almost expect to see the logo of Stax Records, the '60s home of
Otis Redding, on his new CD. Album: "Cee-Lo Green and His Perfect
Imperfections" (Arista).</LD>
<TE>   Dashboard Confessional. "So this is odd, the painful realization
that all has gone wrong," is Chris Carrabba's opening line in "The
Places You Have Come to Fear the Most," and his outlook stays anxious
and bleak through the end of the album. This could be cloying, but
Carrabba brings an absorbing sense of universal struggle to it.
Album: "The Place ..." (Vagrant).</TE>
<TE>   The Distillers. It sounds like Courtney Love sitting in with this
L.A. punk-inspired band, but the raspy vocals belong to Brody
Armstrong, whose songs have a promising touch of X's penetrating
observation. Album: "Sing Sing Death House" (Hellcat/Epitaph).</TE>
<TE>   The Hives. This joyful Swedish quintet attacks the notion that
rock has to be humorless to be real. The music salutes '60s and '70s
punk and garage-rock with near-irresistible energy. Album: "Your New
Favourite Band" (Poptones import).</TE>
<TE>   Norah Jones. Don't be surprised if this supremely seductive young
Texas singer matches Alicia Keys' six nominations in this year's
Grammy balloting. Taste and boldness to spare. Album: "Come Away With
Me" (Blue Note).</TE>
<TE>   N.E.R.D. The Neptunes, the blazing production team that has
sculptured hits for Britney Spears, Mystikal and more, offer a
rock-funk merger that stretches hip-hop boundaries like early Run-DMC
or De La Soul. Album: "In Search of ... " (Virgin).</TE>
<TE>   Conor Oberst. Oberst is a precocious 22-year-old with the audacity
to release two splendid albums this year, one of which ("Lifted ...
or the Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground") has enough
freewheeling literary edge to invite Dylan comparisons. Albums:
Desaparecidos' "Read Music/Speak Spanish" and Bright Eyes' "Lifted
... " (both Saddle Creek).</TE>
<TE>   The Streets. Mike Skinner is a white rapper from England, and his
looks into the youth subculture in his country suggest a sharp
storytelling ability. Album: "Original Pirate Material" (Vice).</TE>
<TE>   The Vines. Craig Nicholls, the Aussie rock band's manic frontman,
gets the attention, but the music has a gritty shotgun force. Thing
to watch: How Nicholls responds next time to the pressures and
tensions of the spotlight. Album: "Highly Evolved" (Capitol).</TE>

<HD>'Gang Tapes' tells it raw, but who will get to see?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Listen to South-Central Los Angeles today and you'll hear the too
familiar sounds of gunfire, sobbing and screams in the night. The
city's homicide rate is rising, and most of the recent murders have
occurred in South-Central, half of them gang-related. Remember the
early '90s, when movies like "Boyz N the Hood" and "Menace II
Society," and rap groups like NWA conjured an indelible image of the
south-side community as a gang-ridden, crack-addled combat zone?</LD>
<LD>   Now listen again, this time to filmmaker Adam Ripp. A 35-year-old
writer, director and producer whose first feature film, "Public
Access," won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, Ripp
recently turned his digital camera on South-Central's enduring
afflictions, the subject of his latest feature film, "Gang Tapes."</LD>
<LD>   Told from the viewpoint of a 14-year-old boy who uses a stolen
video camera to record his gangbanger friends' activities, the movie
is a fictional but harrowingly lifelike portrait of the gang's summer
spree of robbery, rape and crack dealing. Several characters wind up
dead, and another is severely disabled.</LD>
<TE>   Ripp, who grew up in L.A., says he wanted to make a movie that
would do for the gangster "lifestyle" what Oliver Stone's "Platoon"
and Steven Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan" did for warfare: strip
off its flashy veneer. Young men "watch MTV and they see the glamour
of the gangster image," says Ripp, who also is a Los Angeles Police
Department reserve officer. "What they don't see is the young man who
ends up with a colostomy bag because he got shot."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, when Ripp was filming "Gang Tapes," murder rates
were in decline in most U.S. big cities. Outside the neighborhood,
memories of the chaos and carnage in South-Central during the '80s
and early '90s had receded. But Ripp, who began frequenting
South-Central music clubs as a high school student and was familiar
with local gang culture, knew the statistical dip wasn't proof that
the area had healed.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem has persisted, it's always been there," he says.
"Over the years it's been cyclical, it's had its ups and downs, and
now we're reaching back to the early '80s when there was an implosion
with the gang wars, leading up to the riots, and we're seeing those
problems again."</TE>
<TE>   At first Ripp asked himself: Did the world really need another
movie about South-Central gangs? Only, he decided, if that movie
could tell a realistic story without flinching. He resolved to
recruit much of his cast from the ranks of local gang members and
first-time actors, and to use real locations and mostly improvised
dialogue. He wanted to create a fictional film that would read like
cinema verite, or perhaps even Grand Guignol.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to make a film that didn't Hollywood-ize gang violence,
that showed the brutality and the language of the streets, that
didn't sanitize it," says Ripp, who also is a Los Angeles Police
Department reserve officer. "Like with 'Menace' and 'Boyz,' one of
the things that hurt those films for me was that you're looking at
rappers, you're looking at actors. I wanted people to see kids who
had grown up in the community and lived this life."</TE>
<TE>   Caught in the downward spiral</TE>
<TE>   Shot in 12 days on a $500,000 budget in the summer of 2000, "Gang
Tapes" has proven sadly prophetic, not only about rising violence but
also about the difficulty many young men face in escaping its
devastating spiral. In the 1 1/2 years since filming wrapped, several
of the movie's stars have run afoul of the law, mostly in connection
with armed robbery. Ripp says that 90% of the 500 locals he
auditioned for the film had lost a loved one to violence.</TE>
<TE>   One of the film's stars, Six Reasons, who was born 20 years ago in
Watts as Ravel Damion Towns, had a brother murdered at age 22. A
younger brother has just entered college after serving a five-year
jail term. Once, Six Reasons says, a cousin of his was supposed to
pick him up at the "Gang Tapes" movie set after filming. He never
showed up. He'd been murdered.</TE>
<TE>   "I was proud of Adam that he didn't give the film a happy ending,"
says Six Reasons, whose nickname is a tribute to his mother's attempt
to provide for her six children. "He didn't show us driving around in
lowriders, with big gold chains. He showed the raw."</TE>
<TE>   Ripp may have shown it, but how many people in Los Angeles will
get to see it? After no one in Hollywood wanted to release the film
theatrically, Lions Gate sent "Gang Tapes" straight to video and DVD
(it comes out Tuesday). Ripp sounds frustrated in discussing why his
movie isn't playing in theaters, despite earning positive reviews in
Variety and the New York Times. "Theater owners have kind of a fear
that the film will inspire or incite some kind of riot," he says. "I
think it's a really racist perception that black audiences cause
violence."</TE>
<TE>   Greggory Watkins, director of development for Magic Johnson
Entertainment, one of the theater chains that Ripp approached, says,
"We looked at [the film] and we gave it some consideration. Actually,
it's still under consideration, but it's a pretty sensitive topic.
It's being presented as a tool by which it can be educational, and
that's true. But there's a lot of violence."</TE>
<TE>   Watkins says he fears a repeat of the '80s and early '90s, when
pop culture depictions of South-Central often deteriorated into
sensationalism and exploitation. "Do we need another film about" gang
violence, he asks rhetorically. "That's a loaded question.
Everybody's at different points on that journey. It's not about age
or race. It's about culture and maturity."</TE>
<TE>   Ripp believes that films like "Gang Tapes" "need to be made" and
seen because "the truth is the truth, and the truth hurts," he says.
"This is our country, this is the future of America, these are our
young men and women. Sure it's important to do what we do globally,
but it's also very important to look into our own backyard."</TE>
<TE>   No movie, any movie, can bring peace to South-Central. But if more
people shared Ripp's conviction that the time for confronting the
ugly truth is now, it could keep L.A. from writing another tragic
screenplay, one murder at a time.</TE>

<HD>Being Batman can be grunt work</HD>
<DH>No costumes are required, just good actors to voice the
animated superheroes on 'Justice League.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Susan Eisenberg is thrilled to have reached the point where she earns
a living as a voice-over actor, but as performing careers go, it's
hard to think of a more anonymous enterprise. So it may come as a
surprise that on this sunny Friday in Sherman Oaks, she is flanked by
recognizable faces -- ranging from Emmy winner Dana Delany to
"Smallville" co-star Michael Rosenbaum to the venerable Efrem
Zimbalist Jr.</LD>
<LD>   In recent months, in fact, Eisenberg has had the chance to work
with a number of well-known actors, romancing onetime "Dallas"
heartthrob Patrick Duffy and playing opposite the versatile Alfred
Molina.</LD>
<LD>   Then again, being Wonder Woman really should offer a few perks,
shouldn't it?</LD>
<TE>   "I love showing up and seeing who they got as guest stars,"
Eisenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "They" would be the producers of "Justice League," an animated
series on the Cartoon Network in which DC Comics characters unite to
save the world. And like the superhero shows preceding it, the names
that rapidly scroll by at each episode's close often showcase an
array of actors gainfully employed in movies and television, as
opposed to the usual cartoon suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "Going back to the original 'Batman' show, that was one of the
things that I specifically had in mind: I wanted to avoid 'cartoon
actors,' for the most part, because every other superhero show I had
seen for the last 20 years before that had the same tone and voices
to it," said executive producer Bruce Timm.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not really any fault of the actors, but probably more the
way the shows were directed. They always sounded cartoon-y.... I made
a conscious effort to make the shows sound as realistic and
convincing as possible, and at the time I thought that meant using
actors who weren't voice-over actors."</TE>
<TE>   In the case of "Justice League," that has meant tapping into the
ranks of TV and film regulars, including "Providence's" George
Newbern (Superman) and Carl Lumbly of ABC's "Alias," who gives voice
to the green-skinned Martian Manhunter, J'onn J'onzz. Eric Roberts,
Tom Sizemore, Dennis Haysbert ("24"), Kurtwood Smith ("That '70s
Show") and Peri Gilpin ("Frasier") are among others who have taped
guest roles.</TE>
<TE>   Advantages of animation include the fact that no one needs to
dress up for the occasion, as the casually attired (and in some
instances unshaven) actors assemble in the Warner Bros. Animation
facility, a cavernous space nestled within the Sherman Oaks Galleria.</TE>
<TE>   Perched on stools in the spare recording studio, the cast is led
through the script by voice director Andrea Romano almost like a
symphony conductor, taking a few hours to lay down vocal tracks for
an episode that will be illustrated later.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, when you are a superhero fighting evil, the direction
betrays certain quirks of the genre. "Big grunt of effort, please,"
Romano tells guest star Michael Dorn, of "Star Trek: The Next
Generation" fame, playing one of the villains.</TE>
<TE>   Later, she coaches Maria Canals through her Hawkgirl "attack cry"
and, turning to Lumbly, says, "You get electrocuted, please." ("The
one I really have trouble with is the straining grunt," Eisenberg
admits.)</TE>
<TE>   Still, the dialogue goes far beyond guttural exclamations but
rather displays a range of emotion, from light comedy to heavy drama.
At one point, Lumbly sounds as if he could be doing a Shakespearean
soliloquy, eulogizing Superman as "the immigrant from the stars, who
taught us all to be heroes."</TE>
<TE>   "I love the character," says Lumbly, who wasn't familiar with the
relatively obscure J'onn J'onzz before being cast. "It's such a smart
show.... This is closer to theater than television, but without the
same limitations as film. You can go anywhere, in your mind, in your
head."</TE>
<TE>   Scheduled in prime time and readying to begin its new season in
January, "Justice League" doesn't dumb down scripts for kids. Hewing
closely to the comics, the heroes -- Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman,
Green Lantern, the Flash, Hawkgirl and Martian Manhunter -- don't
always get along and face an eclectic roster of threats, from
thwarting alien invasions to preventing an alternate future in which
the Nazis, with the help of a time-traveling supervillain, have won
World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the comic-book premise, the goal is actually to produce
material on an adult level that children can enjoy too. "We try never
to talk down to the audience," Timm says, adding that he tells the
cast, "This is not like any other cartoon you've worked on."</TE>
<TE>   In that respect, the recording process is more like "The
Simpsons," with the producers treating each session like a radio play
-- allowing the actors to interact and play off each other -- as
opposed to taping voices individually, as some cartoons produced for
children do.</TE>
<TE>   'I'd do this for free'</TE>
<TE>   The actors each have their own reasons for getting into animation,
citing a period a few years ago when the genre exploded, both on
prime time and through the proliferation of children's cable
networks.</TE>
<TE>   Delany, who stars in the CBS drama "Presidio Med," had an early
call the day before on that series but made time to reprise her role
as Lois Lane, which began six years ago on "Superman."</TE>
<TE>   "This is just fun. I'd do this for free," she says. "We can do it
anywhere. When I was shooting in Vancouver last year, I did it from
there. I was a Lois Lane freak when I was a kid. It was like a dream
come true. And there's something so liberating about not being seen.
You take more risks, I think, with your voice. You don't worry about
making a fool of yourself."</TE>
<TE>   No one is going to retire to a Malibu estate on the strength of
voice work alone, but it could easily help furnish one. Screen Actors
Guild rates call for actors to receive at least $655 per recording
session for one or two voices, which doubles for providing four or
five. Actors -- who can negotiate for fees above the guild minimums
-- also receive residuals for the episodes, which can repeat over and
over.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the actors who take part are comic-book fans. Others
welcome the chance to play characters their children will savor. "The
only reason JoBeth Williams decided to work with us was because her
kids said, 'Mommy, you've got to do it! That would be the coolest
thing in the world!' " Timm says.</TE>
<TE>   From 'F.B.I.' to butler</TE>
<TE>   For Clancy Brown, who has played menacing roles in films such as
"The Shawshank Redemption" and "Starship Troopers," the opportunity
to do cartoons arose around the time his first child was born, giving
him an incentive -- despite the amount of production that takes place
in Canada and other foreign locales -- to stay closer to home.</TE>
<TE>   Brown auditioned for the role of Superman, which in the earlier
version went to Tim Daly. Instead, he was offered his nemesis, Lex
Luthor. "I thought, 'Geez, it's like the story of my life. Can't I be
the good guy once?' " he says. (Brown's roster of voices also
includes Mr. Krabs on the children's hit "SpongeBob SquarePants" -- a
role, he says, that immediately put his daughter "with the in-crowd"
at school.)</TE>
<TE>   Zimbalist, the square-jawed star of "The F.B.I." in the 1960s and
'70s, gave voice to Alfred the Butler in "Batman" and drove in from
his home in Solvang to play him again.</TE>
<TE>   "I always loved radio, but I never got very far in it," says the
actor, who is 84. "This is just a pleasure. You get to work with
wonderful people, and working with Andrea is a dream. I always tell
her she plays all the parts better than anybody else. She reads them
better than the actors."</TE>
<TE>   Timm has softened his stance toward voice actors, saying he
marvels at the range exhibited by someone like Phil LaMarr, an
alumnus of the Groundlings and Second City who portrays the
14-year-old lead on the WB's "Static Shock" in addition to providing
the sullen baritone of Green Lantern.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the few jobs where you get to be bipolar," notes
LaMarr, wearing a baseball cap and sweats. As for the higher-profile
actors on the show, he says, "Bruce sort of made it OK to do
cartoons."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, animation is more forgiving than live-action films and
television -- a medium in which actors accustomed to fretting over
wrinkle lines and weight don't have to worry about getting older,
much less how they look or what they wear.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, who wouldn't want to be a superhero, especially when you
don't have to squeeze into those uncomfortable tights?</TE>
<TE>   "I get two chances a week to save the world," Lumbly says with a
laugh, alluding to his spy role on "Alias." "Two's enough."</TE>

<HD>A queen to four kings</HD>
<DH>Galka Scheyer championed artists known as the Blue Four and
carved a unique niche in the process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Suzanne Muchnic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It started with a painting of a hunchback. There was something about
the image of a misshapen woman in a bright red blouse whose greenish
yellow face sank into her chest. Emilie Ester Scheyer, a young German
artist, first laid eyes on the painting at a 1916 exhibition in
Lausanne, Switzerland, and couldn't get it out of her mind. It made
her track down the painter and give up her own artistic career.</LD>
<LD>   "Why should I go on painting when I know I can't produce such good
art as you?" she asked Alexei Jawlensky, when she found him living in
Switzerland. "It's better to dedicate myself to your art and explain
it to others."</LD>
<LD>   The rest is art history, and the improbable tale of Scheyer --
Galka, as she is widely known -- an impassioned advocate of modern
art who spent her last 20 years in California and assembled a highly
revered collection that landed at the Norton Simon Museum in
Pasadena.</LD>
<TE>   Examples of her collection, which focuses on Jawlensky, Lyonel
Feininger, Vasily Kandinsky and Paul Klee -- whom she promoted as the
Blue Four and fondly referred to as "my four blue kings" -- are
nearly always on view at the Simon. But the entire holding of about
500 artworks and 800 related documents is about to make its biggest
public splash to date.</TE>
<TE>   "The Blue Four at the Norton Simon Museum," a 496-page catalog of
the collection written by art historian Vivian Endicott Barnett, is
just out from Yale University Press in association with the Norton
Simon Art Foundation. To celebrate the long-awaited event, the museum
has organized two exhibitions.</TE>
<TE>   The first, "My Four Kings: Galka Scheyer and the Blue Four," will
present about 250 artworks and 50 photographs and documents, from
Friday to April 14. While that exhibition will probe the depth of the
museum's Blue Four holding and explore Scheyer's relationship with
her favorite artists, the second show, "From Europe to California:
Galka Scheyer and the Avant-Garde," will reveal the breadth of her
interest in modern art. Paintings, drawings, prints and photographs
by about 45 artists, ranging from German Dadaist Kurt Schwitters to
American photographer Edward Weston and Mexican muralist Diego
Rivera, will be on view from May 16 to Sept. 18.</TE>
<TE>   The collection offers insight into the life of a remarkable woman
"who set out on her own and invented a role for herself in the art
world," Barnett said. More a promoter than a dealer, Scheyer never
had a gallery and wasn't very good at selling the artwork she loved.
But "she had a way of getting to know people and attracting
attention," Barnett said. Calling herself the Minister of the
Exterior for her artists, she talked loudly, had a strong accent and
made a big impression.</TE>
<TE>   Ceramicist Beatrice Wood, who promoted herself as the art world's
grande dame of colorful characters, remembered Scheyer as a
formidable force. "Her voice was so strident and her manner so
intense it was abrasive," Wood recalled in her autobiography. "Yet,
she was so alive in a room, and scintillating, that no one else
counted."</TE>
<TE>   Scheyer's lifelong friend, Lette Valeska, wrote in her memoir:
"She frequently met rejection and disappointment, but her personal
philosophy and determination were so strong, and her commitment to
her task so great, that she refused to be downed by any adversity."</TE>
<TE>   Working as an artist in Europe</TE>
<TE>   Scheyer was born in 1889 in Braunschweig, Germany, the youngest of
three children, and the only one in her middle-class Jewish family
who didn't end up working in the family business (a canning factory).
Emilie was a rebel, Barnett said; she stuck to her plans to be an
artist.</TE>
<TE>   With financial support from home, Scheyer studied art and English
in London, took painting lessons from Braunschweig artist Gustav
Lehmann, traveled to Italy with him and spent a couple of years in
Paris at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. In 1916, when she encountered
Jawlensky's work, she was working as a painter in Brussels.</TE>
<TE>   Scheyer and Jawlensky began exchanging letters and visits. She
bought landscape abstractions from his "Variations" series. He
introduced her to other artists and began a series of "Mystical
Heads," some of which portray Scheyer in a stylized form. In late
1917, he gave her a small version of "The Hunchback" painting that
had so impressed her and dedicated it to "the all-seeing soul." Three
years later, Jawlensky gave her a nickname, Galka, the Russian word
for jackdaw, after a bird that appeared to him in a dream. It stuck.</TE>
<TE>   As Scheyer began to style herself as an artist's agent and
ambassador for modern art, Jawlensky authorized her to organize
exhibitions and write about his work. She also traveled throughout
Germany, giving lectures, making contacts with museum directors,
curators, dealers and artists.</TE>
<TE>   Taking a 45% commission on pictures sold and drawing on family
funds, Scheyer organized a Jawlensky exhibition for a gallery in
Berlin that traveled to several other venues in 1920. The following
year, she presented a show of his work at the New Museum in Wiesbaden
that won critical acclaim and resulted in the sale of 20 paintings.</TE>
<TE>   "A great first success," Scheyer wrote to Jawlensky.</TE>
<TE>   While working on his behalf, she was expanding the circle of
artists whom she would promote and represent. An international group
of artists had gravitated to Germany. Jawlensky, Kandinsky and Klee
all studied in Munich; Feininger in Hamburg and Berlin. The Bauhaus,
the design powerhouse, was also a magnet for the international
avant-garde before the Nazis closed it in 1939. Scheyer became a
frequent visitor at the school, where Feininger, Kandinsky and Klee
were longtime members of the faculty.</TE>
<TE>   But the economic situation became increasingly difficult. In 1923,
accepting the invitation of a friend who had emigrated to the United
States and following the lead of more experienced dealers who left
Europe and opened galleries in New York, Scheyer decided to go to
America. At first she intended to represent a variety of European
Modernists. But by the time she left, in 1924, her focus had narrowed
to four artists.</TE>
<TE>   A disparate group, Jawlensky and Kandinsky were Russian, Feininger
was American, and Klee was Swiss. Feininger is best known for airy
compositions that combine crisp lines with ethereal color. Jawlensky
was an intense colorist whose signature works are abstract human
heads. Kandinsky was a pioneering abstractionist. Klee had a
whimsical, poetic sensibility. Banding together was more a matter of
economics than aesthetics, and the key to their union was Scheyer.</TE>
<TE>   "These four artists stand so close to me in their art; it makes it
possible for me to pursue this venture with a faithful spirit," she
wrote to Feininger as she prepared to go to America.</TE>
<TE>   The artists suggested that she call them "The Four." But they
became the Blue Four, probably in reference to Kandinsky's and Klee's
participation in another artists group, the Blue Rider, named -- in
part -- for an abstract blue and black woodcut of a mounted horseman
by Kandinsky.</TE>
<TE>   Scheyer set sail from Hamburg on May 8, 1924, and arrived in New
York 10 days later. The first Blue Four exhibition opened at the
Daniel Gallery in New York on Feb. 25, 1925. The reviews were
favorable, but nothing sold.</TE>
<TE>   "The exhibition is well attended and one meets many interested
people, even buyers, as Daniel says, if the prices were not so high,"
she wrote to the artists. "I find the prices not too high if one does
not necessarily want to sell. If one has the time to wait."</TE>
<TE>   In search of a new market, Scheyer traveled to Los Angeles, making
all the right Modernist connections. In L.A., for instance, she got
to know architects Rudolf Schindler and Richard Neutra. She had begun
a 20-year California adventure and, as she wrote to the artists in
Germany, had "found her footing in America."</TE>
<TE>   Scheyer initially settled in the Bay Area, where she gave lectures
and presented exhibitions, including a particularly successful show
at Stanford University. She had deals going with galleries and
museums. But by 1930 she decided to move to Los Angeles, where, she
told the artists, "the prospects are better" and "there is more
life." She based that decision on sales to Walter and Louise
Arensberg, major collectors of modern art who had moved from New York
to Los Angeles, and on hopes of selling to Hollywood collectors.
Scheyer finally made the move in 1933, buying land in the Hollywood
Hills and commissioning Neutra to build a house for her -- on a
winding street, off Sunset Plaza, which she named Blue Heights Drive.
She moved into the concrete and glass house in 1934, hoping to use it
as a dwelling and a gallery, but it had little exhibition space and
was hard for her clients to find.</TE>
<TE>   That was far from the biggest problem facing Scheyer and her
artists. Nazi Germany was intensely hostile to modern art. The Blue
Four, some in ill health, couldn't sell their work at home. In
America, the Depression sharply curtailed budgets of museums and
collectors. Scheyer quarreled with the artists and other dealers over
fees and contractual obligations. In 1936, she wrote to Kandinsky
that she felt "like a maid" and lamented that she no longer got
financial support from her family. To keep up with expenses, she
taught art classes.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Four would soon disappear. Klee died in 1940, Jawlensky
in 1941, Kandinsky in 1944. Feininger, who lived until 1956, withdrew
many of his works from Scheyer in 1937, when he returned to the
United States, but maintained a warm relationship with her. Scheyer
died in 1945, at 56. She had drafted her will two months earlier, in
consultation with the Arensbergs, who were negotiating with UCLA to
provide a home for their collection. Scheyer -- who had amassed a
large holding of art through gifts and purchases -- bequeathed her
collection to the university on the condition that it be displayed
"in suitable proportions and for reasonable periods, in the museum
building to be constructed for the Arensberg Collection." If the
university did not build a suitable building by Oct. 1, 1950, the
will stipulated, a committee she had appointed would decide whether
the collection would go to UCLA "or become the property of the Museum
of Modern Art in New York City, or any other institution interested."
That left the field wide open, but she told the committee members she
wanted the collection to remain in California.</TE>
<TE>   The building never materialized at UCLA. The Arensbergs eventually
gave their collection to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Scheyer's
committee entrusted her collection to the Pasadena Art Institute,
which became the Pasadena Art Museum in 1954, and later was bailed
out of bankruptcy by industrialist/art collector Norton Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Scheyer's will required that the institution receiving her
collection "publish an illustrated catalogue of the Collection with
as many color and photographic reproductions of the pictures as
possible, and a minimum of written descriptive matter." Simon
fulfilled that obligation in 1976, confirming the museum's ownership
of the collection. But Simon, who had little interest in
commissioning complete, scholarly studies of his holdings, never
followed up with a full catalog of the Scheyer collection.</TE>
<TE>   The museum's Blue Four collection is well known as one of the
world's largest holdings of the group's work, but the new catalog --
six years in the works -- provides detailed descriptions of each
work. At the same time, it tells the story of a woman who was "way
ahead of her time in terms of her taste and how she saw her role as
the artists' agent or promoter," Barnett said. "It's a very modern
concept, which she was able to carry out in California in a way that
she couldn't on the East Coast or Europe."</TE>

<TE>   Her blue heaven</TE>
<TE>   The artists that Galka Scheyer dubbed the Blue Four were
like-minded modernists who searched for new modes of expression, but
they had no interest in developing a uniform style. Each worked as an
individual, according to his own aesthetic sensibility.</TE>
<TE>   Lyonel Feininger (1871-1956), whose style merged sharp angles and
linear precision with planes of soft color, was born in New York,
studied in Germany and taught at the Bauhaus. "Full-Rigged Ship" was
a gift to Scheyer.</TE>
<TE>   Alexei Jawlensky (1864-1941), known for emotionally charged,
intensely colored images, was born in Russia and lived in Germany and
Switzerland. "The Hunchback," is a version of an earlier image that
led Scheyer to give up her own career.</TE>
<TE>   Swiss artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), known for his playful
imagination, studied in Munich and taught at the Bauhaus. "Maid of
Saxony" was shown in New York, Oakland and L.A., and bought by
Scheyer in 1929.</TE>
<TE>   Vasily Kandinsky (1866-1944), a leading avant-gardist and
abstractionist, was born in Russia, studied in Munich and taught at
the Bauhaus. Scheyer purchased "Pressure From Above" for her
collection.</TE>

<LD>For your consideration....</LD>
<LD>   Just like plastic Santas and eggnog, those three words start
popping up every year around this time, to remind members of the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences about upcoming Oscar
nominations.</LD>
<LD>   This year, the phrase is also being flung at Grammy Awards voters
in the music world. Such unabashed campaigning for Oscar nominations
has long been standard from movie studios, although it's been raised
to new and controversial levels in recent years, with Miramax Films
leading the way.</LD>
<TE>   But it's been more or less discouraged in the music business by
the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences (NARAS), the folks
who give out the Grammys. So some in the music world were shocked to
open trade magazines recently and see full-page ads from Universal
Records promoting rapper Nelly and singer-songwriter Jack Johnson as
Grammy candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The ads don't say anything specifically about Grammy Awards, but a
CD containing eligible songs from Universal artists was sent to press
and potential Grammy voters with the words "Grammy Sampler" on the
spine in advance of the nominations, which will be announced Jan. 7.
The awards will be handed out Feb. 23 at New York's Madison Square
Garden.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been surprised over the years that more people [in the
record industry] have not been more supportive in this area," says
Universal Records President Monte Lipman, who has spearheaded the
company's campaign and cites Miramax co-chairmen Bob and Harvey
Weinstein as his main inspira- tions.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax, though, has taken heat for its efforts, with accusations
that its lobbying "bought" such Oscars as the 1998 best picture for
"Shakespeare in Love," even as the practice was copied by other
studios.</TE>
<TE>   Lipman says he's had no negative feedback about Universal's ads so
far and, in fact, has had inquiries from other labels interested in
following his lead. But he may be getting a less enthusiastic call
soon from NARAS' new president, Neil Portnow.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen some of this in the past in a limited way," says
Portnow. "But unlike the film business, which has a smaller, a
tighter group of [voters], we're interested in making sure there's a
level playing field for the thousands of folks making records. So we
discourage this sort of campaigning. We will have a dialogue [with
Universal]. At the end of the day, there are no rules we are able to
enforce, but we hope our goodwill will prevail."</TE>
<TE>   Spinning the rules</TE>
<TE>   Spin magazine has named the White Stripes' "White Blood Cells" as
the best album of 2002. Only one problem: The album was released in
July 2001. In fact, the album finished fourth last year in The Times'
poll of its pop writers.</TE>
<TE>   Sia Michel, Spin editor-in-chief, notes the album was originally
released on the tiny Sympathy for the Record Industry label and
didn't really have widespread public impact until it was issued last
April by a larger company, V2 Records. In any case, she defends the
choice as the album most representative of developments in the music
world this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Our story about the year in music is about the revenge of the
little bands like Wilco and Flaming Lips who are getting attention
now after many years," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "The White Stripes are emblematic of that."</TE>
<TE>   The magazine's year-end issue is on newsstands Tuesday, and also
names the Strokes as its band of the year and Eminem as artist of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   Emo for eyes, ears</TE>
<TE>   Vagrant Records, the Los Angeles label that's attracted an intense
and loyal following via such earnest artists as Dashboard
Confessional and the Get Up Kids, is launching a new subsidiary to
move into advertising and entertainment marketing.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed Vagrant Entertainment, the new venture will be run by
former J. Walter Thompson executive Andrew Kobliska. It's intended to
serve as a conduit to that audience for outside entities, as well as
to produce videos and marketing campaigns and develop commercial,
film and television opportunities for Vagrant acts.</TE>
<TE>   Co-owner Jon Cohen says the company was created after numerous
approaches from agencies and advertisers who were looking to reach
Vagrant's audience or work with its artists.</TE>
<TE>   Small faces</TE>
<TE>   Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates have finished "Do It For Love," their
first studio album in six years, and will launch their label, U-Watch
Records, with its Feb. 11 release. Supplementing their own new songs
is a version of the New Radicals' "Someday We'll Know," featuring
vocals and production by Todd Rundgren.</TE>
<TE>   The Bollywood-American crossover continues with the upcoming movie
"The Guru," a romantic comedy about an Indian dance teacher moving to
New York. The soundtrack is due Jan. 28 from Universal Records and
will match numbers sung by such Bollywood stars as Lata Mangeshkar
and Udit Narayan with the John Travolta-Olivia Newton John duet
"You're the One That I Want" and tracks by Diana Krall, Samantha
Mumba and Paulina Rubio.</TE>
<TE>   An eBay auction starting today benefiting the People for the
American Way will feature numerous items donated by music stars. Most
intriguing may be a plaque former Reprise Records President Howie
Klein had made in honor of Ice-T's notorious early-'90s band Body
Count. The plaque was intended for, but never given to, then-Vice
President Dan Quayle, a vociferous critic of Body Count. More
information can be found on the PFAW Web site, www.pfaw.org.</TE>

<LD>Whitney Houston</LD>
<LD>   "Just Whitney" (Arista)</LD>
<LD>   * 1/2</LD>
<TE>   Houston has been a tantalizing presence since arriving on the
scene in the '80s with a voice equaled for sheer beauty and command
in mainstream pop only by Barbra Streisand's.</TE>
<TE>   Even if we winced at the overblown pop ballads, Houston injected
almost every recording with a boldness that made such rivals as
Celine Dion and Mariah Carey seem bloodless and one-dimensional.</TE>
<TE>   Through it all, there was always the chance that Houston would
step beyond the pop gloss and use her voice in warmer and more
inviting ways -- which she did by employing contemporary R&amp;B textures
in her 1998 album "My Love Is Your Love."</TE>
<TE>   "Just Whitney" (in stores Tuesday) doesn't follow up on that.
Houston's voice is fine, but the album is a timid outing that fails
to even generate the presence her earlier hits did. There's nothing
with the sheer pop celebration of "I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who
Loves Me)," and this time Houston's heart doesn't seem to be in the
overblown pop, including a version of "You Light Up My Life."</TE>
<TE>   Responding to tabloid rumors about problems in her personal life,
Houston strikes back at outsiders ("Whatchulookinat?), defends her
lifestyle ("Unashamed") and toasts her marriage (a duet with hubby
Bobby Brown on "My Love").</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, "Just Whitney" suffers from the sense of career
desperation that surrounded Michael Jackson's recent CDs. She and
four dozen writers and producers work so hard finding another hit,
they lose track of the human qualities that made her music so
formidable.</TE>
<TE>   -- Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   Transplants hurt by rancid rap</TE>
<TE>   Transplants</TE>
<TE>   "Transplants" (Hellcat/Epitaph)</TE>
<TE>   **</TE>
<TE>   The big banner song "Tall Cans in the Air" lays out most of what
goes wrong on the Transplants' album, and that's rapper Rob Aston's
constant stream of cliched, curse-laden and pointless shouting.
Rapped choruses such as "Tall cans in the air / Lemme see 'em / ...
you" make you feel as if you're arguing with a steroid-maddened
drunk. Worse, it sounds like a punk answer to gangsta rap.</TE>
<TE>   This is a dead shame because, as a kind of pop-punk supergroup
experiment, the mix of Aston, Rancid main man Tim Armstrong and
Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker transcends genre to come up with some
oddly compelling music, a lot of it sounding like Clash outtakes.
"Diamonds and Guns" is one of the better examples, with a Kingston
dub piano pump to it that perfectly sets off Armstrong's obliterated
but surprisingly sensitive vocal.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, "California Babylon" and the exit track "Down in
Oakland" point the way to a gently menacing dub-reggae-punk
breakthrough, but lack the full commitment. The mix has promise
without the raps. With them, it struggles to become much more than
parody.</TE>
<TE>   -- Dean Kuipers</TE>
<TE>   Timbaland rules Aaliyah collection</TE>
<TE>   Aaliyah</TE>
<TE>   "I Care 4 U" (Blackground)</TE>
<TE>   **</TE>
<TE>   The late R&amp;B-pop star and actress had a short but productive life.
This posthumous collection (due Tuesday) features seven hits from
three albums she released before dying in a Bahamas plane crash last
year at age 21, along with six previously unreleased tracks and a
remix of her version of Marvin Gaye's "Got to Give It Up."</TE>
<TE>   The new tunes were completed before Aaliyah's death and are mostly
outtakes from her self-titled 2001 album. Well, it's easy to see why
such forgettable works as the squishy fidelity pledge "Don't Worry"
and the disco-ish hip-hopper "All I Need" didn't make the final cut.</TE>
<TE>   Most of these bland, romance-oriented numbers are merely soothing
sonic wallpaper, with Aaliyah's pretty yet personality-free voice
often treated like just another element in the mix. The songs are
interesting (or not) thanks to such producers as R. Kelly, Teddy
Bishop and Timbaland, whose minimalist blend of hip-hop, funk, soul
and dance-music touches graces most of the hits.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Timbaland-produced smash "Try Again" remains a modern
pop classic. And Aaliyah could sound convincingly sultry. But the
most striking new moment belongs to Timbaland, who infuses "Don't
Know What to Tell Ya" with a noir-funk feel that evokes "Blade
Runner."</TE>
<TE>   -- Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   Quick spins</TE>
<TE>   Phish</TE>
<TE>   "Round Room" (Elektra)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   "I need a new way to express myself so you don't have to guess,"
Trey Anastasio sings on his Vermont quartet's refreshed return from a
two-year hiatus (in stores Tuesday). It's the right instinct. There's
new directness here, even as several songs stretch jazzily to around
10 minutes, and Band-like heart added to the usual whimsy.</TE>
<TE>   -- Steve Hochman</TE>
<TE>   GZA/Genius</TE>
<TE>   "Legend of the Liquid Sword" (MCA)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   With his fourth album (due Tuesday), the gifted wordsmith and one
of the most respected Wu-Tang Clan members assembles another
captivating journey, as he makes entire story lines out of just the
names of animals ("Animal Planet") and celebrities ("Fame"). The
moody production and guest appearances from his Wu brethren keep the
GZA's legend alive.</TE>
<TE>   -- Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   Common</TE>
<TE>   "Electric Circus" (MCA)</TE>
<TE>   * 1/2</TE>
<TE>   On the masterful "Between Me, You and Liberation," this Chicago
rapper (who appears Thursday at the Universal Amphitheatre) offers
moving commentary on sexual abuse, the death of a family member and
homosexuality. The rest of his fifth album is a messy hodgepodge of
demo-quality experimentation in musical styles.</TE>
<TE>   -- S.B.</TE>
<TE>   Craig David</TE>
<TE>   "Slicker Than Your Average" (Wildstar/Atlantic)</TE>
<TE>   **</TE>
<TE>   The English R&amp;B-dance-pop heartthrob scored some fame with his
inventive 2001 debut, but this follow-up spends too much time
alternately bragging and moaning about being a celebrity. He even
brings in Sting to back up his whining on "Rise &amp; Fall." The watery
"Personal" is breezily seductive, but David's emulation of Prince, 'N
Sync, the Beatles et al doesn't bode well for his potential as a
superstar innovator.</TE>
<TE>   -- N.N.</TE>
<TE>   Campfire Girls</TE>
<TE>   "Delongpre" (Mootron)</TE>
<TE>   **</TE>
<TE>   The name is ironic, kids -- there are only boys in L.A.'s Campfire
Girls. The quartet's debut turns the musical clock back to the
mid-'90s, perhaps underscoring the timelessness of grunge, but adding
nothing to the canon of heavy rock and no-frills production.
Alternating between seductions and confessions, the songs have some
interesting ideas, along with occasionally disarming humor. But the
characterless vocals and colorless drone drag "Delongpre" down.</TE>
<TE>   -- N.N.</TE>
<TE>   No Knife</TE>
<TE>   "Riot for Romance!" (Better Looking)</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Who needs cutlery in a world of stabbing riffs? Eight years and
four albums have sharpened this San Diego quartet's assault, which
engages its audience in a test of sonic pinball that occasionally
racks up points with pop flourishes. While the settings frame a
measured fury, No Knife's songs settle for the vague restlessness
suggested by the label "post-punk." The band performs tonight at the
Troubadour.</TE>

three stars (good) and four stars (excellent). The albums are already

<HD>Journalists losing touch with the man on the street</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SHAW</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an era when network anchors in tailor-made suits sign
multimillion-dollar contracts, and some of their talking-head,
syndicated columnist colleagues earn more from one speech than the
average American earns in an entire year, it may be difficult to
imagine, but journalism in this country was, until relatively
recently, a largely blue-collar craft.</LD>
<LD>   As recently as 1971, only 58% of newspaper journalists had college
degrees; now 89% have degrees, according to the American Society of
Newspaper Editors. But only 15.5% of the total population age 25 and
older have finished college.</LD>
<LD>   The median annual salary for "experienced reporters" working at
newspapers with more than 250,000 daily circulation -- the 40 largest
papers in the country -- was about $56,000 last year, according to a
newspaper industry study. Pay for "senior reporters" -- and for top
reporters and editors at the largest of these papers -- is
substantially more. But median income for all U.S. workers over 15 is
about $31,500.</LD>
<TE>   In other words, many big-city journalists -- especially those who
set the agenda for what gets covered in the rest of the media -- have
moved away from much of the largely middle- and working-class
audience they purport to serve. At best, they're out of touch. At
worst, they've become elitists.</TE>
<TE>   The natural sympathy that most journalists feel for the underdog
and for the downtrodden prevents the media from ignoring the poor.
The fascination that the American public has with the rich and famous
prevents the media from ignoring the upper strata of society. But
newspapers seldom write about the middle class, the working class --
white- or blue-collar.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't write about them because we no longer live like them,"
says Martin Baron, editor of the Boston Globe. "We live in other
neighborhoods, and we don't visit theirs. And I fear that there is a
subtle disdain for their lives, their lifestyles, their material and
spiritual aspirations."</TE>
<TE>   Today's sophisticated, well-paid, well-educated journalists often
have more in common with their sources -- government officials,
university scientists, high-powered lawyers and businessmen -- than
they do with their readers. In a sense, that's not surprising. As the
world has become more complex and more specialized, the better news
organizations have tried to hire their own specialists -- reporters
with law degrees to cover the courts, reporters with medical degrees
to cover medicine, reporters who attend seminars and write books on
various other specialized topics to cover those fields.</TE>
<TE>   That helps create a more sophisticated news report. But it also
helps create a serious disconnect between newspaper and reader.</TE>
<TE>   The typical newspaper journalist today, according to research done
by the American Society of Newspaper Editors, is "a liberal,
college-educated, white, male baby boomer," and too many of them are
"elitists," says Rick Rodriguez, executive editor of the Sacramento
Bee.</TE>
<TE>   "Not everybody on our staff gets paid superbly well," Rodriguez
says, "but the majority get paid reasonably well for Sacramento. That
gives us a different perspective. We assume that everybody has
air-conditioned cars and air-conditioned homes in Sacramento, where
air-conditioning is needed. We assume that everyone can afford to
take a vacation.</TE>
<TE>   "When you start with those kinds of assumptions, it skews the
kinds of stories we put our efforts into and how we approach them and
what we don't do."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, most journalists try to maintain a kind of natural
separation from their audience -- a professional detachment that they
feel is essential to maintaining their professional standards of
noninvolvement and nonpartisanship. Writing in USA Today last summer,
Philip Meyer, who teaches journalism at the University of North
Carolina, said this necessary professional detachment by journalists
can lead to "a haughty indifference to all they survey."</TE>
<TE>   Professional detachment often leads to personal detachment --
detachment from most readers' everyday concerns. That reinforces the
elitist tendencies that come from education and a good income.</TE>
<TE>   Sandra Mims Rowe, editor of the Portland Oregonian, recalls a
newsroom discussion at the Oregonian this year about a state law
requiring tax refunds to individuals, even though the state was in
"dire financial shape."</TE>
<TE>   "The refund would amount to several hundred dollars per family,"
Rowe says, "and our journalists were sitting around saying, 'Why
doesn't the state do something about this law and balance the budget
instead? A few hundred dollars isn't that much.' But to many of our
readers, several hundred dollars is a lot of money, and we have to
make sure our coverage isn't biased in that way."</TE>
<TE>   The growing gap in income and education between journalists and
most of their potential readers -- and the difference in values and
lifestyles that often derive from that gap -- is a problem for
newspapers already weakened by competitive pressures and declining
public confidence, especially in a weak economy, with a rapidly
growing immigrant population.</TE>
<TE>   For years, editors have been saying, rightly, that they have to
hire and promote more women and more minorities. But diversity should
be -- well, more diverse. After all, college graduates -- male or
female, white, black or brown -- don't have a monopoly on the kinds
of street smarts and life experience that make a good reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Rivard, editor of the San Antonio Express-News, says that
when he was an editor at Newsweek in the mid-1980s, "I was not a
college graduate, and I was determined to hire someone else who had
not graduated from college, a blue-collar guy like me."</TE>
<TE>   He did just that, and he says his blue-collar reporter "did a
great job, making connections that most of our other reporters didn't
necessarily see because of their own backgrounds."</TE>
<TE>   If other enterprising editors did the same thing today and hired a
few bright people with blue-collar backgrounds who want to write and
show some aptitude for journalism, they might find that -- with the
right amount of instruction and supervision -- these nontraditional
journalists would see some issues, make some connections and produce
some stories that tend to elude their college-educated,
upper-middle-class colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   I suppose that in the ongoing economic slump, with newspaper
profits down considerably from the recent glory years, some media
overlords, more obsessed with the bottom line than with journalistic
excellence, might offer a different potential solution -- cutting the
pay of their reporters and editors significantly so they can share
the problems, hardships and non-elitist attitudes of their readers.</TE>
<TE>   Personally, I prefer Rivard's approach.</TE>

<LD>Architect David Rockwell maneuvered through the exhibit of artfully
displayed everyday objects until he reached the area titled
"Dynamic." Here, he paused to pontificate on the beauty of a bright
yellow vacuum cleaner. "It has an original point of view," he said,
noting the transparent dust-collection area. "It exposes function,
and it takes that function and makes it a unique and surprising
form."</LD>
<LD>   Clearly, Rockwell's eye transcended those of even the
design-fluent who mingled at the Monday night opening of "Line on
Design" -- hosted by Chrysler, Conde Nast, the Design Industry
Foundation Fighting AIDS (DIFFA) and the Museum of Contemporary Art
in Los Angeles -- in the lobby of the Pacific Design Center. One man
adjusted his severe black eyeglass frames and said, "I don't know
what to make of this."</LD>
<LD>   The exhibit, which remains open to the public through Dec. 17, is
one of a series of events that DIFFA hosts throughout the country
each year to increase HIV/AIDS awareness. It was modeled after a
slick advertising supplement that Chrysler published in nine Conde
Nast magazines this month, and features five categories of design:
color, comfort, craft, dynamic and technology.</LD>
<TE>   As he toured the displays, Rockwell, who is also DIFFA's chairman,
explained that the Hermes saddle "exposes the craftsman's hand." The
woman modeling her own long black hair represents "the dynamic of
movement." And the chair made of felt "takes a material we're
familiar with ... and creates a shape that's kind of cocooning."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace Wyss, whose engraved name tag declared him a
representative from KUCR-FM (88.3) "Autotalk," complained that an
impossibly thin digital camera on display had "out-cuted itself. It
looks like a wrapper that you would throw away."</TE>
<TE>   As he spoke, actress Kelly Lynch posed for a photographer near the
vertical tubes filled with gray, lavender and turquoise M&amp;Ms. She
said later, "The gray ones were very ... Prada."</TE>
<TE>   Headphones were provided, offering recorded explanations. At the
"Dynamic" display, a woman's voice discussed a Hoshino bass guitar.
"It works just like any other guitar," she said. "But it looks much
cooler."</TE>

<HD>Sounds good, yet ...</HD>
<DH>The L.A. Philharmonic goes all out on its inaugural Disney
Hall schedule, but it strays from its West Coast roots and perhaps
from the city's music lovers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Swed</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank Gehry's extraordinary Walt Disney Concert Hall is the most
highly anticipated new orchestra home since Hans Scharoun designed
the Philharmonie for the Berlin Philharmonic 40 years ago. That it
will become a tourist attraction, a focal point for the redevelopment
of downtown, a fresh emblem for Los Angeles, is more than likely.
That its opening will attract a huge amount of international
attention is inevitable. And first impressions count.</LD>
<LD>   But second impressions mean more. The Los Angeles Philharmonic's
inaugural season in Disney Hall is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
for the orchestra to bask in the Gehry limelight, and it clearly
intends to do so. For its opening Disney Hall concerts in October,
the Philharmonic has capitalized on many of its strengths, and it has
learned from the mistakes that have plagued other hall openings.</LD>
<LD>   More important, it has also announced an admirably ambitious
season, overflowing with big-name conductors and big-name soloists.
We can look forward to a stream of world premieres, innovative
educational programs, an array of Baroque and new-music offerings,
along with a series of panels and symposia. In addition, the
Philharmonic programmers have come up with novel thematic threads to
help tie it together.</LD>
<TE>   Since the 2,265-seat new hall is a third smaller than the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion, the Philharmonic's home since 1964, the orchestra
will add a full 50% more concerts. Yet so impressive is the depth of
the programming and the quality of the performers that every
orchestra program next season can be recommended without hesitation.
While the hall is a novelty, the Philharmonic audience will be
enormously bolstered by gawking looky-loos who might not otherwise
attend an orchestral concert. That is a gift the Philharmonic has no
intention of squandering.</TE>
<TE>   Still, without wanting to seem curmudgeonly in the face of such
lavish and intelligent offerings, and fully prepared for the hall to
turn out to be an architectural and acoustical masterpiece -- and
maybe one of social planning as well -- I'm not convinced that
absolutely everything is right in paradise.</TE>
<TE>   Some doubts started when I was wandering through the aisles of a
record store the other day. In conversation with a clerk, I happened
to mention that the Philharmonic was about to announce its first
Disney Hall season. Suddenly someone walked up to the cash register
infuriated. He didn't want to know anything about Disney Hall. Long a
subscriber to the orchestra, supporting it through thick and thin in
the Pavilion, he won't be setting foot in its new digs, since the
lowest-priced subscription seats will rise from $14 to $35. He said
he had come to hate the orchestra and could no longer bear to look at
the new hall -- all that expensive steel repulses him. He will buy
records instead.</TE>
<TE>   Although I haven't heard a peep about the top-priced seats rising
to $120, I've encountered repeated complaints from less-well-heeled
Philharmonic faithfuls feeling frozen out. Asked about this,
Philharmonic general manager Deborah Borda assured me that single
seats, not yet on sale, will be less expensive and that student and
senior discounts will continue. She also explained that the ticket
prices had been left unreasonably low for so many years that playing
catch-up obviously leads to sticker shock.</TE>
<TE>   However, given the opening-season demand the single and discounted
seats will surely be hard to come by. And with the pricing strategy,
the orchestra has alienated some of the city's most devoted music
lovers, dependent on their weekly Philharmonic fix.</TE>
<TE>   But you've got to love the orchestra for making a significant
gesture toward children and community workers by inviting them to be
the hall's first official audiences in a series of four preview
concerts the week before the big-ticket formal opening galas. The
first program will be a kids' concert, with a new, interactive piece
by Tan Dun; next will be programs for the hall's construction
workers, teachers, public employees, social workers.</TE>
<TE>   You might point out that the Philharmonic is cleverly gaining
goodwill by using regular folks as guinea pigs. But this really is a
win-win situation, in which the orchestra serves the community and
builds new audiences, at the same time avoiding the most common
pitfall of new halls. It is the embarrassing norm to open halls in
which technical kinks are not worked out and performers have not had
ample opportunity to adapt to new acoustics, as has been the case in
recent years in Seattle, New Jersey and Philadelphia. Happily, the
first two Disney Hall galas are designed to really show off what the
Philharmonic does best. The third, devoted to film music, may be an
eager grab at movie money, but thus far there have been no details of
the program other than notice of a new work by John Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome experimentation</TE>
<TE>   The season's thematic programming -- especially a "creation"
festival, a celebration of the bicentennial of Berlioz's birth and a
"building music" project -- all makes sense. The theme of creation
allows for a strong one-two "Resurrection"-"Creation" punch, with
Mahler's Second Symphony the first week of the season and Haydn's
oratorio the second. The theme also encompasses the nine world
premieres the orchestra will present over the season. Trying out
works made for specific buildings -- such as Monteverdi's "1610"
Vespers, intended for St. Mark's in Venice, and Berlioz's "Requiem"
for Les Invalides in Paris -- should be a fascinating acoustical
experiment in this vineyard-style hall with no proscenium stage. And
what composer better than Berlioz to test the hall's ability to
project blasts of brilliant instrumental color?</TE>
<TE>   The layout of Disney Hall offers further opportunity to stretch
the boundaries of orchestral presentation, and the Philharmonic is
trying a couple of welcome experiments. Notably, British theater
troupe Complicite will invent a dramatic context for Berlioz's
"Symphonie Fantastique," as it did for Shostakovich's 15th String
Quartet in its absorbing "Noises of Time" at UCLA last spring. Opera
will get a trial run as well, with a chamber work by Osvaldo Golijov.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, impressive as all this is, the Philharmonic appears almost
hypnotized by juggling its many programmatic balls. Keeping all of
them in the air is no small feat, and that may be why the orchestra
hasn't dared, at least for this first season, to launch a really big
one, to do something truly spectacular. Certainly plenty of big works
are on the bill, but nothing stands out as a stupendous statement the
way William Bolcom's cast-of-thousands "Songs of Innocence and
Experience" or Golijov's groundbreaking Latino "Pasion Segun San
Marco" do this season at the Orange County Performing Arts Center.</TE>
<TE>   The West Coast premiere of Stockhausen's "Gruppen" for three
orchestras might have done it. So might have a concert performance of
the "Les Troyens" as the centerpiece of the Berlioz celebration.
Zubin Mehta, whose first concert in Disney Hall will be Beethoven's
Ninth, conducted the mammoth Berlioz opera with the Chicago Symphony
a couple of seasons ago. Think what a statement Marin Alsop might
have made if, instead of Barber's drab First Symphony, she were to
conduct Bernstein's flashy, ever-controversial "Mass," which she does
extremely well.</TE>
<TE>   And not enough of the music signals Disney Hall as a symbol of the
West. The Philharmonic hasn't shunned West Coast music altogether
next season. Admirably, the opening galas include Salonen's "LA
Variations" and newly commissioned works by John Adams ("The Dharma
at Big Sur") and John Williams. Salonen has promised a new piece to
close the season. But in between, Disney Hall might just as well be
in Bilbao.</TE>
<TE>   California pioneers absent</TE>
<TE>   What with Gehry's architecture serving to reflect the Southland's
physical environment, the Philharmonic is remiss in not doing the
same for its cultural environment. The orchestra has added a
four-concert world music series to its presentations, inviting stars
from around the globe. But absent are the California pioneers --
Charles Seeger, Henry Cowell and Lou Harrison, Terry Riley -- who
meld world music with classical music. Nor is there a tip of the hat
to Colin McPhee, the first composer to re-created the effects of the
Balinese gamelan with a Western orchestra, and a member of the UCLA
music department for the last years of his life.</TE>
<TE>   The most glaring omission of all, though, is Henry Brant, who won
a Pulitzer Prize last year. Long a resident of Santa Barbara, Brant
is the foremost champion of spatial music, which is to say in moving
all around the hall. The 90-year-old composer is a character, to
boot, and audiences adore him. It is hard to imagine any "building
music" festival without him, let alone one in his backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously the orchestra can't do everything the first year, and
there is more than enough to look forward to. Still, it would be nice
if Disney Hall's beautiful shiny steel exterior wasn't the only thing
that mirrored its surroundings, and if the orchestra could find a way
to make it a bit easier to let everyone in.</TE>

<HD>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Taylor</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Christmas has television pretty much all to itself for the next 2 1/2
weeks. Due to the quirks of the shifting Jewish calendar, Hanukkah
finished unusually early this year; Kwanzaa, as always, doesn't start
until Dec. 26. So for the next 17 days, anyone who watches TV will be
excused for singing "It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas."</LD>
<LD>   Today alone, broadcasters and cable companies are airing 50 shows
somehow relating to Christmas. For the week, the total is close to
300. True, some of these are the same program shown over and over,
but on the other hand we're not even counting the home shopping
networks and Christian broadcasters, both of which are feasting on
holiday fare almost nonstop.</LD>
<LD>   The range of offerings is as broad as the diversity of channels
that are available: from the star-studded specials the broadcast
networks offer to the minutiae of wreath-building HGTV (Home &amp; Garden
TV). There's even a smattering of too-late Hanukkah and too-early
Kwanzaa shows.</LD>
<TE>   Because even the most avid tube-watcher will have difficulty
figuring out what to see, we've put together this highly selective
sampling of a week's worth of holiday programming, divided into four
key categories. (We're ignoring animated shows, which are spotlighted
in this week's TV Times.) And because this is a season of giving and
receiving, we'll also note some not-so-obvious gifts in these holiday
offerings.</TE>
<TE>   Star-studded specials</TE>
<TE>   Andy Dick ("Less Than Perfect") offers "O Christmas Tree," John
Ritter ("8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter") sings "Deck
the Halls" (accompanied by Kenny G) and "The Bachelor's" Aaron Buerge
offers piano accompaniment to "The Bachelorette's" Trista Rehn on
"Jingle Bells" on "ABC's Christmas in Aspen" at 7 tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Gifts to: stars of ABC shows who get a chance to be seen out of
character.</TE>
<TE>   "Blockbuster Hollywood Christmas Spectacular": "Fear Factor's" Joe
Rogan and "Dog Eat Dog's" Brooke Burns host this revamped
entertainment show that is based, loosely, at the down-on-its-luck
Hollywood Christmas Parade, which airs at 7 tonight on NBC.</TE>
<TE>   Gifts to: NBC for getting some fairly cheap holiday programming,
and a West Coast complement to its Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Walters interviews President Bush and tours White House
Christmas decorations on ABC's "20/20" at 10 p.m. Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Gifts to: Walters, for scoring this exclusive "get" two years in a
row.</TE>
<TE>   Special episodes</TE>
<TE>   Sitcoms are especially inspired this year. ABC's "8 Simple Rules
for Dating My Teenage Daughter," "Life With Bonnie," "Less Than
Perfect" and "George Lopez" all have holiday-themed episodes. So does
"Everybody Loves Raymond" on CBS, and "Friends," "Will &amp; Grace" and
"Hidden Hills" on NBC, as well as the WB's "Reba." Even some of the
dramas are getting into the spirit: NBC's "Ed," "The West Wing" and
"ER"; CBS' "The District"; and PAX's "Just Cause," among them.</TE>
<TE>   Gifts to: writers for these shows, who have an easy hook to hang
an episode on.</TE>
<TE>   Scripted series are easy. Special mention, though, must go to
NBC's "reality" hit "Fear Factor," airing a special installment in
which the main challenge is to eat reindeer testicles.</TE>
<TE>   Gifts to: not sure, but definitely not the reindeer.</TE>
<TE>   Hands-on</TE>
<TE>   How-to mainstays HGTV and the Food Network are pretty much decking
every hall and roasting every chestnut, respectively. We know we
won't miss Food Network's "All Stars Holiday," at 9 tonight, in which
nearly all of the cooking channel's celebrity chefs are on board.
Notably missing is Emeril Lagasse; he has his own special, "Emeril
Live: Hilda's Holiday Traditions," on at 8, during which he'll
celebrate his mother's cooking prowess.</TE>
<TE>   Gifts to: dieters, who can look rather than touch.</TE>
<TE>   For kids</TE>
<TE>   Animal Planet has perhaps the most novel original show: "Animals
of the Nativity," airing at 5 p.m. Thursday. Everyone knows about the
three wise men, and the various shepherds who attended the Nativity,
but little has been said about the camels and lambs and other animals
that were there. Until now.</TE>
<TE>   Gifts to: as always with this channel, animal lovers.</TE>
<TE>   But no listing would be complete without also mentioning "A
Flintstone Christmas," which airs at noon Saturday on Cartoon
Network. In this repeat episode, Fred and Barney deliver toys after
Santa sprains his ankle in Bedrock.</TE>
<TE>   Gifts to: anyone who can explain how even the most modern Stone
Age family could celebrate a holiday that wouldn't start for
thousands more years. Just another case of Christmas magic.</TE>

<HD>Talk to her about great filmmakers</HD>
<DH>Considering her parentage, it carries some weight when
Geraldine Chaplin calls Pedro Almodovar 'the greatest director
alive.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Geraldine Chaplin was as radiant as the sun pouring into her
balconied Chateau Marmont suite. She was back in her native territory
-- she was born in Santa Monica -- for the AFI Fest 2002's recent
closing-night screening of Pedro Almodovar's "Talk to Her," in which
she has a pivotal role and which she considers his greatest film yet.</LD>
<LD>   With her dark hair in bangs and a pigtail running down her back, a
white shirt over black Capri pants, Chaplin, at 58, looked much like
the ballet student she once was.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the slender Chaplin plays a ballet teacher in the film, a
choreographer of ballets so fervently topical that her descriptions
become comical.</LD>
<TE>   She is, however, a loving mentor to one of the film's principal
characters (Leonor Watling), a promising ballerina rendered comatose
when she is hit by a car. The teacher's attentiveness ultimately
provides a crucial link in the film's complex narrative, and Chaplin
captures the appealing humor within the intense personality of the
teacher with wit and economy.</TE>
<TE>   "Ballet was my first love, but I wasn't really good at it at all,"
Chaplin said. "So I didn't see any ballet at all for years. And it is
not like riding a bicycle -- you do forget how to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, she found acting for Almodovar a pleasure, although
her companion since 1979, cinematographer-turned-painter Patricio
Castilla, remarked while Chaplin was off being photographed, "Pedro
asks 150% of his actors -- but he gives them 150% back."</TE>
<TE>   "Pedro reminded me of my father. He could make you laugh, then cry
and then laugh again," Chaplin said. "He'll do all the parts, he'll
show you how to do it. He has a knack of explaining a character to
you like a snake putting you under a spell, yet he is open to any
kind of suggestions, then takes them and makes them better." As far
as she is concerned, "He's the greatest director alive."</TE>
<TE>   One of the most accomplished actresses of her time, Chaplin
remains active in television and films, with occasional stage
appearances thrown in. She is as comfortable acting in Spanish or
French as she in English, which she speaks with a slight mid-Atlantic
accent. Film historian David Thomson has gone so far as to assert
that he believed he "would give up all of Charlie's work for 'Cria
Cuervos' (Raise Ravens), which contains a performance of the utmost
rigor and depth from his daughter Geraldine."</TE>
<TE>   Arguably the finest of the films Chaplin made during her long
association with Spain's veteran filmmaker Carlos Saura, the 1975
film afforded Chaplin a dual role, playing a dying woman and her
daughter as an adult deeply affected by her mother's death. To
Thomson, Chaplin has "the natural face of vulnerability; the same
resolute stare belonged to Lillian Gish."</TE>
<TE>   She has acted for David Lean, who launched her international
career with a role in "Dr. Zhivago," Robert Altman and Alan Rudolph
-- as well as for outrageous experimental Swiss director Daniel
Schmid, among others. Although Chaplin, based in Switzerland near her
late parents' home, has spent much of her life and career in Spain,
she had never before appeared in an Almodovar film. "I was buying a
newspaper at a kiosk in Madrid when I ran into Pedro, who said, 'Give
me your phone number.' Well, it seemed like I waited three months by
the phone for a call, and when it came I was sure it was for an
invitation to a premiere for one his films, but then I thought, 'Wait
a minute, he doesn't have a film coming out!' He asked me if he could
send me a script, but I immediately said yes to the part sight
unseen."</TE>
<TE>   Starting with "The Flower of My Secret" in 1995, but especially
with his last film, "All About My Mother" (1999), critics have found
in Almodovar a new level of maturity, a phrase he will accept while
not much caring for it.</TE>
<TE>   Of "Talk to Her," a convoluted tale of the vagaries of love
involving a male nurse in love with that comatose ballerina, Chaplin
observes that Almodovar has thrown over his "compulsive need to
entertain," and she sees him on a path of spiritual discovery, which
to her means "delving into the dark, not the light as New Age types
would have it. He understands that we are completely dominated by
nature and are confoundingly amoral. But he has so much compassion
that there is never a character in his films that he doesn't like
himself."</TE>
<TE>   Chaplin is, however, irate that "Talk to Her" was passed over as
Spain's official Oscar entry (in favor of Fernando Leon de Aranoa's
"Mondays in the Sun," starring Javier Bardem as a laid-off shipyard
worker). She says she's sure she understands why it happened.</TE>
<TE>   "Spain was a dictatorship for 40 years, and just because you have
elections doesn't mean you're a democracy," she said. "There's this
mentality that never allows anyone to get too big; it's a fascist way
of thinking. And when there's a joyfulness about the artist, as there
is about Pedro, who is at the height of his career, well, they just
want to keep them down."</TE>
<TE>   What angers Chaplin most is that she perceives the snub as a
put-down of Almodovar for his art. "At least when my father was
attacked it was for his politics -- even Louella Parsons, that viper,
acknowledged that Charlie Chaplin was a great artist."</TE>
<TE>   As for her father's legacy, Chaplin is pleased that his films are
going to be released on DVD by Warner Home Video, "each with lots of
extras, including a commentary by a director, Woody Allen among
them." She also reports that Marin Karmitz's MK2 Productions has
released "The Great Dictator," Chaplin's daring 1940 spoof of Hitler,
in France with much success and screened it in Berlin to an
enthusiastic audience "not 100 yards from Hitler's bunker." Its DVD
release will be accompanied by the documentary "The Dictator and the
Tramp" by Kevin Brownlow, responsible for the memorable "Unknown
Chaplin" series featuring unseen footage from the director's own
vault. Geraldine's sister Josephine oversees the affairs of the
Chaplin legacy from Paris, which is home base for sister Victoria's
traveling circus.</TE>
<TE>   The eldest of Chaplin's eight children by his third wife, the late
Oona O'Neill, daughter of playwright Eugene O'Neill, Geraldine
admitted she is not close to all her seven siblings but expresses
special enthusiasm for sister Annette-Emilie, who with her husband
runs a theater company in a converted silo a 45-minute drive from
Paris. Meanwhile, her brothers Michael and Eugene live on at their
parents' large estate in Vevey, Switzerland, struggling with the
government bureaucracy for permission turn it into a museum.</TE>
<TE>   Chaplin's son by Saura, Shane, 28, is a psychologist working at
Miami Children's Hospital's emergency room while pursuing his
doctorate, and Oona, her 16-year-old daughter by Castilla, is a
student at Scotland's prestigious Gordonstoun School.</TE>
<TE>   Chaplin was also featured in another film at the AFI Fest 2002:
Antonio Hernandez's intriguingly cryptic family drama, "The City of
Lost Souls," in which she is cast opposite Fernando Fernan Gomez, who
plays a rich, dying businessman haunted by guilt. Chaplin plays his
much younger wife, a steely woman of icy elegance. Gomez is a revered
stalwart of the Spanish cinema, with whom Chaplin has acted several
times. "He's so funny about acting," she said. "He says, 'I find it
the most embarrassing experience in the world. I do it only for the
money.' "</TE>
<TE>   Next up for Chaplin is a new version of "The Bridge of San Luis
Rey" with an ensemble cast that includes Robert De Niro, Harvey
Keitel, Kathy Bates and F. Murray Abraham among others, for Irish
director Mary McGukian. "It's been so long in the works that I was
first cast as the ingenue and then the mother and now the old
abbess," she said, chuckling.</TE>
<TE>   "My ideal year is to appear in a great big American
super-production, then do one of those marginal French films, then
something on TV and then for a first-time director. Sometimes," said
Chaplin, "it actually happens."</TE>

<HD>Honing the cutting edge</HD>
<DH>At REDCAT, CalArts' high-tech theater inside Disney Hall,
director Mark Murphy has ambitious plans for new programming.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Timberg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Murphy, the recently appointed executive director of REDCAT, the
Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater, looks too refined to be wearing
a hardhat. Slim, with delicate features and wearing an Oxford shirt,
he's standing in the REDCAT construction space inside Walt Disney
Concert Hall; workers hoist Sheetrock, and circular saws roar through
metal behind him. "Frank Gehry has described Disney Hall as a living
room for Los Angeles," Murphy says. "I think of us as the basement
laboratory or rec room."</LD>
<LD>   It would be hard to find a rec room this ambitious. The walls are
still unfinished, revealing the dense network of ventilation, optical
cable and wiring that makes the high-ceilinged room, which will seat
between 180 and 266, look like something out of "Blade Runner." With
sophisticated acoustics and extensive wiring for video and film
projection, the walls are seismically balanced so precisely that
simply drilling a hole in the wall requires X-raying the concrete for
structural soundness.</LD>
<TE>   Today, with a kind of boyish exhilaration, Murphy, 42, is
discussing his plans for this $21-million gallery and performance
space, which he envisions as informal, flexible, technologically
sophisticated. He promises to bring important international groups to
town, and to make REDCAT a lab for edgy new programming produced
here. Both are skills he honed in his 17 years at Seattle's On the
Boards, an alternative performance space that's hosted the Wooster
Group, Laurie Anderson and Bill T. Jones and nurtured local talent.</TE>
<TE>   As he attempts the mix in L.A, he'll be fighting a war on two
fronts: trying to offer Los Angeles fresh, interdisciplinary
performances from all over and to satisfy the educational mission of
his CalArts masters in Valencia. Murphy, who arrived in January to
consult for CalArts and was named to his current post in October, is
an unpretentious guy who seems to thrive on getting people to agree.
He'll probably need his enthusiasm and steady temper in the months
ahead as he tries to create a venue that's one part Brooklyn Academy
of Music, one part high-end student recital.</TE>
<TE>   University President Steve Lavine has been seeking a space in the
city for 15 years -- a pedagogical version of New York's the Kitchen
-- to bring the school's artists to a larger audience and to bolster
L.A.'s arts community. "It's hard here to have a career in
contemporary-minded performance; dance is almost impossible. And
there's a whole new kind of media art, as well as new-music theater,
that are really rich forms in our time but meagerly represented here.</TE>
<TE>   "Our focus is nurturing artists' careers; that's what CalArts is
about."</TE>
<TE>   Though there's some suspicion that CalArts' brass may see the
space as an outlet for projects by students and faculty, not a
resource for the city, "The thing it will not be is any kind of
vanity showplace for CalArts," says Lavine.</TE>
<TE>   "The term I often use is that we're an annex for CalArts in the
city," Murphy says, adding that the setting can benefit the city and
the school. "I think more interaction with the harsh realities of the
real world can be useful for students and faculty."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy sees REDCAT's programs as being one-third artists from
CalArts, one-third from the L.A. area and one-third by touring
companies. In addition to major residencies by theater and
performance groups, the season will include new music, an authors and
poets series, and film, video and animation.</TE>
<TE>   He's still nailing down the rest of the season, but he's ready to
announce some of next year's programs, which will begin with Dumb
Type, a Japanese octet whose performance is based on movement and
electronics. Residencies by groups like this will feature
performances, discussions, master classes and workshops for artists
in the community and students at CalArts.</TE>
<TE>   The artists, says Murphy, will shape the futuristic space. REDCAT
will have almost 500 light circuits, more than many Broadway houses,
as well as two parallel sound systems, one for film and video, the
second for live performance. Signals from the Internet can be
projected within the space, and performances in REDCAT can be
broadcast over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   As Murphy puts it: "It's a well-equipped blank canvas."</TE>
<TE>   Just how groovy and nurturing will the place be?</TE>
<TE>   Susan Solt, dean of the school of theater, says she's most
interested in making a space for "the imaginative creative artist
who's really pushing the envelope," as well as offering "a
professional component" for students and faculty. Several CalArts
faculty members -- say, playwriting professor Suzan-Lori Parks, who
won a Pulitzer Prize for "Topdog/Underdog" -- would be a natural for
the REDCAT space.</TE>
<TE>   But no matter what the balance of CalArts versus non-CalArts
programming, the work REDCAT stages may well be less flashy than its
recent high-profile productions. Works like its unconventional and
much publicized June production of "King Lear" -- delivered with
video cameras and an audience that roamed through a warehouse space
-- will be difficult for REDCAT to mount. The budget for that
production was $450,000 -- a sizable chunk of REDCAT's entire annual
budget, which Murphy says will be at least $1 million and perhaps as
much as $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy says that REDCAT's fare will be smaller in scale than most
of what's offered at UCLA Performing Arts' Theater Festival --
chamber music, he says, to UCLA's symphonies. "The space is designed
for intimacy and for a high-impact relationship with the performers,"
Murphy says, stressing also the room's flexible technology. And
competition he says, can be healthy.</TE>
<TE>   Village theater over 'Star Wars'</TE>
<TE>   "There's a certain enzyme that gets released when you're
experiencing a live performance," says Murphy, the son of an actor/TV
personality, Cullen Murphy, and a painter, Jeannette Murphy, who
sometimes designed for the stage. "I also try to be really open and
vulnerable to subconscious impact. I think it's the obviousness of
most movies that frustrates me."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy describes a childhood in Staten Island and Walla Walla,
Wash., that was uncommonly distanced from pop culture: He remembers
feeling guilty for preferring the plays he saw in Greenwich Village
theaters to the Disney films his friends knew. While other kids in
the pre-punk '70s bought Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, he was hung up on
jazz and "Jesus Christ Superstar." The teenage Murphy fell asleep at
"Star Wars" when it came out in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   He acted locally, doing work onstage as well as on public
television throughout high school and college.</TE>
<TE>   After dabbling in radio -- his first job was at a country station
in Washington -- and local politics, he leapt back into theater at On
the Boards, hungry to be back with creative people.</TE>
<TE>   He started as a PR and marketing director, and in less than four
years he'd become artistic director. "On the Boards was an
artist-founded organization that was first and foremost designed to
serve artists in the development of their work," he says. "The reason
we began to do so much presenting was to expose the artists'
community to what was happening around the world. I found myself
alternately playing the role of dramaturge, producer, hand-holder and
at times, almost the booking manager."</TE>
<TE>   Stretching an annual budget that grew from $325,000 to $1.2
million by the time he left in 2001, Murphy found Seattle artists,
many of them with little experience, and developed them through
programs like monthly 12 Minutes Max nights -- informal curated
evenings where artists presented short pieces -- into mature, touring
groups. An average of two groups a year toured internationally, and
some of his finds, like dance theater group 33 Fainting Spells or
"garage orchestra" the Degenerate Art Ensemble, ended up winning
awards in Europe. Murphy's success with this, Lavine says, was a
major reason for CalArts' interest.</TE>
<TE>   REDCAT's plans to build local talent are what Murphy seems most
excited about. Such programs already exist in Los Angeles, some of
them long-standing and with a track record of success. The Mark Taper
Forum, for instance, runs an annual New Work Festival, as well as
Taper, Too, for what the Taper calls "fully staged productions for
cutting-edge theater works." Its laboratory programs develop work by
Latino, black, Asian American and disabled playwrights. South Coast
Repertory in Costa Mesa has a development program called
Collaboration Laboratory with a national reputation.</TE>
<TE>   But REDCAT's programs would differ, Murphy says, by being more
interdisciplinary. "A majority of what they develop could be
classified as plays," says Murphy; his projects would be less
dependent on text, with strong elements of dance, visual art, video
and architecture. Murphy envisions a year-round presence, with an
evening based on 12 Minutes Max offered quarterly, then every four to
six weeks, and an Interdisciplinary Festival annually. "So there
could be a 17-year-old hip-hop dance theater group alongside a
veteran writer or choreographer," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Mark has a vision that's not just about the box office, but about
process and development," says Luis Alfaro, the L.A. playwright and
performer, who helps develop the work of emerging artists at the
Taper. "That's a very important agenda these days, because there's
not a lot of people doing it." Alfaro has known Murphy since he
performed at On the Boards in the mid-1980s as part of 12 Minutes
Max. "Everybody [in the performance world] knows Mark. He's got a
reputation for consistency as an administrator," in a world with very
high turnover.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I welcome another player in town embracing
contemporary theater," adds UCLA Performing Arts' director David
Sefton. "And I hope that the powers that be at CalArts empower Mark
to run his space without interference."</TE>
<TE>   REDCAT's challenge is to find ways to fill its high-tech blank
canvas with programming that will serve both the CalArts campus and
the greater Los Angeles audience. And so far, Murphy's optimistic.
He's got allies in the right places.</TE>

<DH>Though Donna Tartt will readily talk about her novels, she
likes to keep her private life ... well, private.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael J. Ybarra</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>San Francisco</DL>
<LD>Donna Tartt is a small, tightly wrapped package. Her arms are folded
over a black, double-breasted jacket buttoned to the neck; her legs
are crossed in a long black skirt, revealing a bit of black hose that
quickly disappears into a medium heeled black shoe. Her dark hair is
equally severe, bobbed to frame her face, which she frequently turns
away even while talking to you. Her skin shows no sign of having seen
sun; her eyes are green and ethereal, like light through a stained
glass window. Smiling is not her strong suit.</LD>
<LD>   Ten years ago, Tartt published her first novel, "The Secret
History," which she had started writing in college and which sold a
million copies in the U.S. and was translated into two dozen
languages. And now, after a decade of work, Tartt, 38, has just
published her second novel, "The Little Friend" (Knopf), with a huge
first printing, 300,000 copies.</LD>
<LD>   Tartt says that she is a slow, meticulous writer, but very quickly
you get the idea that maybe she produces a novel only every decade or
so because she dislikes the book tours that come with celebrity. "Our
Reticent Hero," one Web site devoted to Tartt calls her.</LD>
<TE>   Rather basic biographical facts, for example, such as whether she
is married, are off limits.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like to talk about my personal life," she says, sitting
in a chair in the corner of a hotel lobby.</TE>
<TE>   Why?</TE>
<TE>   "Why should I?" she asks, well, tartly.</TE>
<TE>   Personal publicity, Tartt explains, is not just annoying; it's
actually injurious to a writer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's detrimental," she says. "It's actively harmful. It draws
attention away from the books. The books are the important thing. I
think that a writer's life is very unimportant. The book is the
important thing. I'm not an actress; it's not my job to present
myself as myself. Books are objects that stand on their own. There's
too much interest in text being interpreted in terms of the writer's
own or imaginary biography. Hemingway is a really good example.
People think that they've got Hemingway's number, that they know who
he is, so they don't bother to read his books anymore. Hemingway's
life was not the interesting or important thing about him; it was his
books, that's what he did."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Tartt is no slouch at carefully crafting an image, always
smartly turned out, as fastidious in appearance as in print. She
lounged like a rather stern-looking odalisque (in riding boots and
holding her dog) for a photo in Newsweek recently and so great was
the buzz stirred up by the bidding war for her first book that Vanity
Fair sent a writer with Tartt back to Grenada, Miss., where she grew
up, for a fawning profile.</TE>
<TE>   Tartt is the elder of two daughters of a service station
owner-cum-local politician; she started writing poetry at 5 and began
publishing in literary reviews in her teens. In Tartt's telling,
reading was always in the air at home, like the scent of magnolia. A
great-aunt and an aunt were librarians, and Tartt worked in the
public library as a high school student.</TE>
<TE>   "We just all read," she says. "It was just something in the
culture of my family. I didn't know other children who read."</TE>
<TE>   Tartt went to the University of Mississippi in Oxford, where she
wanted to write for the school newspaper but didn't have any clips.
She submitted a few short stories. The editor passed them to Willie
Morris, a member of the New York literati and former editor of
Harper's who was a writer-in residence at Ole Miss. He became a
mentor, urging her to transfer to Bennington College in Vermont.
There Tartt started writing the novel that became "The Secret
History," about an elite group of classics students at a New England
school a lot like Bennington who kill a farmer and then one of their
own.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had had the money, I probably would have gone on to graduate
school and become an academic," Tartt says. "So it's probably a good
thing that I didn't have the money."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, after almost a decade of work, she finished the novel.
Author Bret Easton Ellis ("Less Than Zero") was a close friend from
Bennington, and he introduced Tartt to his agent, Amanda Urban, at
Creative Management. Before long, Tartt had sold the hardcover and
paperback rights for close to a million dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "The Secret History" was a huge success but, except for a few
magazine pieces, Tartt largely dropped out of sight for the next
decade. "Ten years of mysterious silence," as Vanity Fair put it
recently.</TE>
<TE>   Not so mysterious, Tartt says. She was just working, either in her
house near Charlottesville, Va., or in her New York apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "I write pretty slowly," she says. "It's part of every author's
job to decide one's own pace and not to pay too much attention to
other people's expectations. When I start something, I don't ever
think of how long it will take me or I'd probably never start in the
first place."</TE>
<TE>   "The Little Friend," like its predecessor, begins with a death.
This time it's the mysterious hanging of a 9-year-old boy named Robin
from a tree in his family's yard in Mississippi. A dozen years later,
in the 1970s, his sister Harriet, who was an infant at the time of
his death, decides to solve the murder -- if that is what it was.
Although the book builds to moments of suspense, "I'm not interested
in murder so much as questions of guilt and culpability and the
echoes of murders and evil throughout time," Tartt says.</TE>
<TE>   "A line from Sophocles that I think of again and again is, 'If
evil shall lead to evil where shall the chain of evils end?' That's
what interests me most about murder, and it doesn't even have to do
with murder but moral wrong. I'm not interested in detectives or
mysteries or thrillers in the conventional sense. If people read my
books thinking they're getting a conventional mystery or thriller,
they're going to be disappointed, because that's not what I do at
all."</TE>
<TE>   'Vitally interested' in writing</TE>
<TE>   What Tartt has done is to create a vivid world, populated by
well-developed characters, especially Harriet, the bookish, smart,
headstrong 12-year-old whose description even sounds like Tartt.
Although Tartt says she had no idea it would take so long to write
the book, it doesn't sound as if she regretted a moment of it.</TE>
<TE>   "One has to really want to come back to it again and again," she
says. "You can't fake interest in something for 10 years. You have to
be vitally interested in it. One hopes that something of one's own
interest, of that obsession, will come itself to the reader."</TE>
<TE>   That largely has not been a problem. The book has hovered at the
top of The Times' bestseller list since its publication in October,
and most reviews have been adoring. "Tartt's second novel confirms
her talent as a superb storyteller, sophisticated observer of human
nature and keen appraiser of ethics and morality," Publishers Weekly
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of critics have carped that, at close to 500 pages, the
novel takes almost as long to read as it did to write. "Lacks all the
seductive, page-turning thrills of its predecessor," complained the
Seattle Times. "The story has moments of suspense," the L.A. Times'
review said, "but they are undermined by a basic sluggishness."</TE>
<TE>   Tartt's next book shouldn't take nearly so long to write. She was
commissioned to write a novella, a modern retelling of a classic
myth. She picked the story of Daedalus, the inventor who built the
labyrinth for King Minos.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll be interesting to write something short," she says. "And to
be somewhat bounded by the actual story I have. The story is already
there. The treatment and angle at which one sees it is new. It won't
require a lot of planning. The Greeks already did that for me."</TE>
<TE>   Tartt won't discuss her idea for the recasting. "I don't really
want to talk about the treatment," she says. "It's not going to be
set in ancient Greece. But I'm really interested in the forms and
idioms of Greek tragedy, which are strangely ambiguous and unsettled.
Sophocles' tragedies are very open-ended and modern; they're not
tidily summed up."</TE>
<TE>   And she's already at work on her next big novel, although don't
even try to pry any details out of her. "Personally, I'd just have
people read the book," she says. "I don't have that much to say
that's not contained within my books. One wants, above all, one's
book to be read."</TE>
<TE>   Then Tartt uncurls herself from her chair and stands up, topping 5
feet in heels, and runs off to a bookstore reading.</TE>
<TE>   "Giving readings is completely different," she says. "I love to
read in public. That part is enjoyable."</TE>

<HD>Saving for College Is Made Easier With Tax Breaks</HD>
<DH>State-sponsored 529 plans are gaining in popularity, but
choosing among various offerings can be daunting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Allyson Atkins may be just 5 months old, but she's already
participating in the hottest trend in college finance -- a 529
savings plan.</LD>
<LD>   Allyson's father, Newport Beach investment manager Michael Atkins,
started a 529 for her shortly after she was born, joining a trend
that has seen these state-sponsored college savings plans grow nearly
a hundredfold in the last five years. They are expected to quadruple
again before 2006, according to Cerulli Associates, a Boston-based
consulting firm.</LD>
<LD>   The reason for their popularity: tax breaks.</LD>
<TE>   From the standpoint of federal taxes, 529 plans, which are named
after the section in the tax code that created them, work much like a
Roth IRA. Money contributed doesn't provide a federal tax deduction,
but investment earnings grow on a tax-deferred basis. And as long as
the money is used for college, withdrawals from the plan are free of
federal income tax.</TE>
<TE>   Most states provide identical tax breaks on state income taxes for
529 withdrawals, but 23 states go a step further and give upfront tax
deductions too -- offering a break on state income taxes similar to
that supplied by 401(k) plan contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Other pluses: The college plans give parents more control over the
kids' college money, and they offer simple investment choices and
modest investment minimums to accommodate parents who can't afford to
contribute large amounts to the plan.</TE>
<TE>   For Atkins, the fact that parents can save substantial amounts on
a tax-deferred basis is particularly attractive.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to get as early a start as possible because of the time
value of money," he said. "We are very concerned about the high cost
of college education."</TE>
<TE>   But deciding among the wide range of 529 offerings can be
daunting, said Luis Fleites, a Cerulli analyst.</TE>
<TE>   "The various states have different tax laws governing them. There
are different investment options, different managers, different fees
and different structures," he said. "It is extremely confusing."</TE>
<TE>   The plans have been around since 1997 but took off only last year,
when the federal government decided to make the plans tax-free as
long as the money is used for school. Withdrawals used for other
purposes are subject to taxes and tax penalties, however.</TE>
<TE>   The investment options in a 529 work somewhat like those of a
401(k). The plan sponsor -- an investment management company hired by
the state -- picks one or several investment options from which
participants may choose. Participants generally can alter their
investment choices once a year.</TE>
<TE>   Every state offers at least one 529 plan. Each has different
investment options, fees, investment minimums and other features.
Savers can choose a plan from any state, regardless of where they
live. For a full-time student, the money in the account can be used
to pay for tuition, fees, books or room and board at any accredited
college in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Unless your state provides tax deductions for contributing to your
own state's plan, there's no compelling reason to favor one plan over
another.</TE>
<TE>   Atkins chose Allyson's plan -- the Golden State Scholarshare Fund
-- on the advice of a financial commentator, who said the California
program is one of the best in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Experts suggest that parents consider these factors when choosing
a 529:</TE>
<TE>   * State tax breaks. If yours is one of the 23 states that offer an
upfront deduction for state income taxes, that alone could tip the
balance in favor of your state's plan.</TE>
<TE>   But note: Only residents of the states that offer the deduction --
California isn't one of them -- are eligible for the tax break. For
example, a Californian who decided to use a 529 plan offered by New
York or Colorado would be unable to use the upfront tax deduction
they offer.</TE>
<TE>   * Fees. The plans carry various fees, including charges for
enrollment and annual maintenance and sales charges on investments.
Fees reduce returns, and all other things being equal, the lower the
fees the better.</TE>
<TE>   * Investment choices. Typically, 529 plans offer an age-based
investment option that mixes stocks, bonds and cash in proportions
the managers deem appropriate based on the amount of time the child
has before enrolling in college.</TE>
<TE>   Commonly, plans also offer all-fixed-income and all-stock options.
Some states have plans that pay returns based on inflation of college
costs.</TE>
<TE>   California and a few other states offer social investment options,
which screen out the stocks of tobacco producers, distillers, gaming
companies and the like.</TE>

<HD>Reborn Eagles Lose Peaceful, Easy Feeling</HD>
<DH>Musicians advocate Henley is sued by a fired bandmate who
calls him a hypocrite in royalties fight</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Leeds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rock star Don Henley has become an outspoken advocate for musicians'
rights, complaining loudly and often about greedy music labels that
allegedly shortchange bands out of their royalties.</LD>
<LD>   "Record companies have been screwing artists for ages," he said in
an interview last year. "It's time we organize and fight back."</LD>
<LD>   But now, in a little-noticed court case bubbling through the
system, the 55-year-old Henley finds himself accused of essentially
the same unfair practices by one of his own former bandmates.
Longtime Eagles guitarist Don Felder has sued Henley, claiming that
the singer and fellow band member Glenn Frey cheated him out of his
share of album and concert earnings.</LD>
<TE>   The legal showdown follows an internal dispute last year in which
Henley and Frey fired Felder, a member of the band since 1974. The
case could expose the inner workings of one of America's best-selling
bands and decide what will become of hundreds of millions of dollars
the Eagles earned after reuniting in 1994 for a successful tour and
new album.</TE>
<TE>   Feuds among band members are not uncommon in the music business.
The Eagles turmoil is the latest in a long history of intra-band
legal wrangling that runs from the Beatles to Guns N' Roses to
Destiny's Child. But this dispute is unusual because it involves
bandmates who had managed to play together for such a long time.</TE>
<TE>   And it could be a particularly big blow to the reputation of
Henley, who has blasted the music labels' contracts and accounting
practices in testimony before California lawmakers. He also leads the
Recording Artists Coalition, which this year demanded fairer
agreements and additional disclosure of financial data from the
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Felder's lawsuit accuses Henley and Frey of bullying him into
"one-sided" agreements divvying up band profits, withholding
financial information and firing him without cause.</TE>
<TE>   Felder, 55, declined to be interviewed but issued a statement to
The Times referring to Henley: "It is absolutely the height of
hypocrisy for him to attempt to reinvent himself as the champion for
artists' rights."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, filed last year in Los Angeles County Superior Court,
seeks past earnings and potentially lost income totaling more than
$50 million. Felder is seeking to dissolve Eagles Ltd., the
corporation that holds rights to the band's name, some unreleased
recordings and other property.</TE>
<TE>   Henley, who is scheduled to give a deposition in the case Tuesday,
could not be reached for comment last week. But Daniel M. Petrocelli,
the attorney representing Henley and Frey, said the band's various
contracts had been disclosed and "fully approved" by Felder.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not offering to return the 15 or 20 million he made since
1994, is he?" Petrocelli said. "Everything in that complaint is: 'I
regret what I did, even though I made $15 or $20 million, and I want
to rewrite history.' Felder jumped at the chance to get back in this
band when it reunited, because it made him a lot of money."</TE>
<TE>   Henley and Frey countersued Felder in August, alleging he breached
his contract by writing and trying to sell a "tell-all" book about
his life in the band. The book has not been published.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Possible Settlement</TE>
<TE>   Record executives who have been following the case say they expect
the two sides to reach a settlement eventually. But Felder has
complained that Henley and Frey have withheld crucial documents
during the discovery process, prompting a judge in the case to
sanction them $5,600 earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Irving Azoff, the band's longtime manager and Henley's personal
manager, said: "I'm really proud of what Don Henley and other artists
have accomplished" in pressuring labels to reform their business
practices.</TE>
<TE>   Felder, he added, "should be saying thank you."</TE>
<TE>   Azoff said the lawsuit would not interfere with the band's plans.
The Eagles have toured without Felder for the last year, adding
guitarist Steuart Smith to their lineup. Azoff said the band was
recording a new album and planned to mount another tour next year.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles are regarded as one of the most successful American
bands ever, having sold more than 80 million albums in the U.S. alone
since forming three decades ago. The band's "Greatest Hits 1971-1975"
ranks as the best-selling album of all time, with an estimated 28
million copies sold, according to the Recording Industry Assn. of
America.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles were founded in 1971 by Henley, Frey, bassist Randy
Meisner and guitarist Bernie Leadon -- four musicians who had played
backup for Linda Ronstadt. After scoring early hits such as "Witchy
Woman" and "Take It Easy," the band added Felder to its lineup in
1974 as part of a shift to a harder rock sound. The band also made
him a shareholder in Eagles Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   The band continued its ascent toward megastardom but was beset by
infighting. Leadon left in 1975. Meisner left two years later, after
the completion of the album "Hotel California," whose title track was
co-written by Felder.</TE>
<TE>   After contentious recording sessions for their next album, the
band members halted their work together in 1980. Each continued to
receive royalties on sales of Eagles albums.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the band members pursued solo careers. Henley and Frey
scored the biggest individual successes, but neither approached the
blockbuster success of the Eagles as a recording artist or concert
draw.</TE>
<TE>   After more than a decade apart, the band reunited in 1994 for a
tour titled "Hell Freezes Over," a reference to a remark Henley once
made about the prospects for a reunion.</TE>
<TE>   Before getting back together, Felder's lawsuit says, the band
members had always split album, concert and merchandise revenue
equally. But, according to the suit, Henley and Frey demanded that a
new corporate structure be designed for the reunion effort and
threatened to fire him unless he agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Under that 1994 agreement, the lawsuit contends, profit would flow
into a series of new companies in which Henley and Frey each held
about 30% stakes -- double that of band members Felder, Timothy B.
Schmit and Joe Walsh -- as well as all voting stock.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit says Henley and Frey engaged in self-dealing to divert
money from the Eagles corporation to these new companies. In other
instances, the lawsuit maintains, Henley and Frey paid "excessive
compensation" to Azoff, in part by cutting sweetheart deals to divert
profit to Azoff's record label, Giant Records, and his merchandise
sales firm.</TE>
<TE>   The 1994 album "Hell Freezes Over" has sold an estimated 7.7
million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Since '94, the Eagles
have generated more than $240 million in ticket sales.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Petrocelli said Henley and Frey were entitled to bigger
shares because they founded the band and wrote most of the Eagles'
songs. Since Felder's departure, he said, the Eagles "have been
playing to sold-out crowds, and there hasn't been a single person
asking for a refund because Don Felder was not there."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit also alleges that Henley improperly used his stake in
the Eagles corporation as leverage in his own legal disputes. The
lawsuit says Henley and Azoff steered the "Hell Freezes Over" album
to Geffen Records as part of an agreement to settle Henley's legal
battle with the label over his solo contract.</TE>
<TE>   After the settlement, Henley was released from the contract and
then signed a three-album deal for an estimated $30 million with
Warner Bros. Records, according to sources familiar with the
situation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Allegations of Bullying</TE>
<TE>   Felder's lawsuit says that in 2000, after a successful concert to
ring in the new year, Henley and Frey again bullied him into signing
a new deal that would further diminish his role. Under the agreement,
Henley and Frey would receive triple the proceeds that Felder got
from the band's new boxed set. That collection has sold about 267,000
copies.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, the lawsuit says, Henley and Frey grew increasingly
upset with resistance from Felder and his business attorney, Barry
Tyerman. Felder said he tried to "appease" Henley and Frey by
dismissing Tyerman early last year. But he said Henley and Frey still
notified him that he had been fired from the 30-year-old band.</TE>
<TE>   What "I've learned from Don Henley, Glenn Frey and Irving Azoff is
not to trust anyone," Felder said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the lawsuit, Henley and Frey told Felder that his
termination also required him to sell back his shares in the Eagles
corporation for a nominal sum. The suit says that Henley and Frey
eventually informed Felder that they also would buy back his shares
in the Eagles' affiliated companies and that they enclosed three
checks totaling a mere $3,000.</TE>
<TE>   But for all of Felder's grumbling about being squeezed out,
Petrocelli said, his clients acted in the best interests of the
Eagles.</TE>
<TE>   They "felt, creatively -- chemistry-wise and performance-wise --
that he should no longer be part of the band," he said. "They removed
him, and they had every legal right to do so. This has been happening
with rock 'n' roll bands since Day One."</TE>

<HD>Continental Shows Airlines How to Be a Phoenix -- Not a
Dodo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Are the big, full-service airlines dodo birds, doomed to extinction?</LD>
<LD>   That question suddenly becomes very real with the expected
bankruptcy filing of UAL Corp., the parent company of United
Airlines.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's No. 2 carrier was denied a government loan guarantee
last week after the federal Air Transportation Stabilization Board
found that United's hopes for profitable operation, even when good
times return, were unrealistic.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the future remains clouded for most of the other big
airlines -- including AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, Delta Air Lines
and Northwest Airlines -- that fly passengers nonstop over long
distances, serve meals and run so-called hub-and-spoke operations to
ferry travelers from small cities to big ones through large,
expensive airport terminals.</TE>
<TE>   All of those airlines are posting losses this year and are ceding
business to the discount carriers -- Southwest Airlines, JetBlue
Airways and others -- that have lower costs because they don't bother
with complex hub-and-spoke systems or offer meals beyond an
obligatory bag of peanuts.</TE>
<TE>   So, is it inevitable that the big airlines will dwindle just as
many of the once-mighty department store chains have done in the face
of competition from discounters such as Wal-Mart?</TE>
<TE>   Don't bet on it.</TE>
<TE>   The big airlines can have a prosperous future if they reform labor
relations, flight schedules and other operations. And there's a good
chance that they'll take those difficult steps just as one of their
brethren, Continental Airlines, already has done.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, following Continental's path won't be easy for many of
its rivals.</TE>
<TE>   "The major airlines must reform rigid work rules that prevent
productivity -- the kind of rules that say if a lightbulb falls on
the floor only an electrician can pick it up," notes Michael E.
Levine, a Yale law professor and former airline executive.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, the big airlines' expenses are simply out of
control. United's costs are more than 50% higher than those of
Southwest. American's are 48% higher.</TE>
<TE>   Such differentials allow Southwest and other no-frills airlines to
offer cheap fares, and travelers are responding. Discount airlines
now account for 20% to 25% of all air travel in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   But Continental has shown that it is possible for a big airline --
in its case serving 244 cities worldwide with 2,500 flights a day --
to be competitive with the discount carriers. Its costs are only
about 17% higher than Southwest's, a tolerable figure given
Continental's breadth of service.</TE>
<TE>   Continental began its journey to reform in 1994, when Gordon
Bethune became chief executive and started cutting expenses where he
could. For example, he shifted the responsibility for tugging
aircraft away from the gate to truck drivers instead of relying on
more highly paid mechanics to perform that task.</TE>
<TE>   The onetime Boeing executive also has reformed Continental's fleet
with new aircraft that are more economical to operate.</TE>
<TE>   Good times in the '90s helped. Bethune shrewdly catered to
business customers, increasing Continental's revenue and profit. The
airline recently built a new terminal at Newark, N.J., with a special
rail connection to New York City for busi-</TE>
<TE>   ness travelers.</TE>
<TE>   He also has played tough when called for. Bethune once threatened
to sue American Airlines for trying to impose industrywide size
limits for carry-on baggage. His attitude: If businesspeople want to
take their baggage onboard, Continental should do everything it can
to serve their needs.</TE>
<TE>   Yet by far the most important reforms that Bethune has implemented
are on the labor front.</TE>
<TE>   When he arrived at the airline, Continental's employee-management
relations were very bitter -- similar to those now plaguing United.</TE>
<TE>   The airline had been built by Frank Lorenzo, who merged then-Los
Angeles-based Continental into his Texas Air and added People
Express, Eastern Airlines, Frontier Airlines and others. Lorenzo, an
investment banker, put the company through a bankruptcy proceeding in
the 1980s that gave him the opportunity to change work rules and
slash wages.</TE>
<TE>   Simply put, he wanted to get rid of the unions.</TE>
<TE>   Bethune changed all that, showing that he valued his employees.
For instance, he took to handing out cash bonuses for on-time flight
performance and cheered on workers demonstrating initiative, like the
flight attendant who offered business travelers free drinks to
compensate for a shortage of meals on a flight.</TE>
<TE>   What Bethune understands is that employee relations are especially
important in a service business such as air travel, where ticket
agents, flight attendants and others are in daily contact with
often-stressed customers who are dashing for flights or simply afraid
of flying.</TE>
<TE>   As Bethune once quipped: "Who wants to be locked up at 35,000
feet" with angry employees?</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Continental is losing money this year, as are all the
big airlines. But with its restructuring largely behind it,
Continental is poised to take off once the slump in the travel sector
ends, as surely it will.</TE>
<TE>   And though a painful industry shakeup is clearly on the way, the
big airlines are bound to follow a similar flight plan. Continental
has shown them the way.</TE>

<HD>Bankruptcy May Compound Your College Loan Problem</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Liz Pulliam Weston</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: My daughter went to an expensive college that had a good
program in her area of interest: teaching learning- disabled
students. Now, four years later, she has had one job that paid
$24,000 and lasted a little more than two years.</LD>
<LD>   With incurred interest, she's facing student loan debts of more
than $45,000.</LD>
<LD>   I'm divorced and receive no financial help from my daughter's
father. I helped with tuition and living expenses as much as I could
on my small salary, and even now, I'm able to help very little.</LD>
<TE>   My daughter feels she can't go to graduate school to become a
psychologist as she had hoped because of her financial situation.</TE>
<TE>   She feels defeated. Obviously, we didn't realize the amount of
debt she was accumulating, much less the interest she would face.</TE>
<TE>   Is there any way she could get rid of this debt by filing for
bankruptcy?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Typically, no. Student loans are among the few unsecured
debts that normally can't be erased in Bankruptcy Court.</TE>
<TE>   Your daughter may be able to make an argument to the bankruptcy
judge that repaying the loans would pose an extreme financial
hardship for her.</TE>
<TE>   However, judges usually define "extreme financial hardship" pretty
narrowly. Your daughter probably will want to talk to an experienced
bankruptcy attorney about whether this gambit could work.</TE>
<TE>   Even if she could get the loans wiped out, the bankruptcy would
stay on her credit report for 10 years, compromising her ability to
get credit in the future.</TE>
<TE>   If any of the loans your daughter received were Perkins loans --
low-interest loans typically given to low-income students -- she may
be able to get that part of her debt canceled over time if she can
get a job in her field. Teachers of disabled children, along with
certain professionals in health care and law enforcement, can qualify
for cancellation of Perkins loans.</TE>
<TE>   For more information, she should refer to attorney Robin Leonard's
book "Take Control of Your Student Loan Debt" (2002, Nolo Press).
Otherwise, her options are limited.</TE>
<TE>   Your daughter got sucked into the trap faced by many students
these days: borrowing more than she could afford to repay.</TE>
<TE>   Student loans are easy to get, and few people really think about
the payments they'll face once they get out of school.</TE>
<TE>   In general, undergraduates should use the salary they expect to
make in their first year out of college as a guide for how much they
can safely borrow. Rarely should you take out loans if the payments
will exceed 10% of your gross pay once you graduate.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing how much the payments will be can be tricky, because
student loan rates usually are variable.</TE>
<TE>   To be conservative, you can figure on an 8% rate, which would
require a $12 monthly payment for each $1,000 you borrow, assuming a
10-year repayment period.</TE>
<TE>   If that's too much math, then just figure you shouldn't borrow
more than two-thirds of your projected pay.</TE>
<TE>   Because schoolteachers typically make less than $30,000 to start,
the most your daughter should have borrowed is about $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   If that amount wasn't enough to pay for the college she wanted,
then she needed to find an alternative, such as a cheaper college or
working part time while she was in school.</TE>
<TE>   Her goal now should be to find a job -- any job -- and start
hammering away at those loan payments. The longer she puts it off,
the more interest will accrue.</TE>
<TE>   There is one silver lining: If she hasn't consolidated her loans,
she has a chance to lock in a super-low 4% rate on any federal
student loans she has. She should talk to her lender or visit
www.salliemae.com for more details.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There's No Harm in Checking Your Credit</TE>
<TE>   Q: If I request my credit report every so often, will that affect
my credit score?</TE>
<TE>   A: Your request for your own report doesn't hurt your score. What
can hurt is applying for new credit accounts. When a lender pulls
your report as part of the credit-granting process, that typically
knocks your score down a bit.</TE>

<HD>Mystery Shopper Checking Her List</HD>
<DH>A marketing researcher anonymously buys from online
retailers to determine whose Web sites and services are naughty or
nice.</DH>

<LD>Kylee Magno must have been very good this year. She is getting 100
presents for Christmas.</LD>
<LD>   Dresses, books, electronic gadgets and other items -- most with
bright gift wrapping and heartfelt cards -- already are pouring into
her Chicago apartment from all manner of online shopping sites.</LD>
<LD>   But there will be no surprises inside those boxes. Magno bought
them. She sent them to herself and plans to send back every one.</LD>
<TE>   Magno is an online mystery shopper, a market researcher who
anonymously buys from electronic commerce sites to test the
experiences they offer customers. She gauges ease of use, selection,
payment procedures, shipping, customer service, return policies and
much more.</TE>
<TE>   For Magno, shopping is no mere recreational activity. She takes
meticulous note of every step of the process, counting each mouse
click and clocking the transactions to the second.</TE>
<TE>   Mystery shopping has long been a tool for researchers who judge
how well stores are serving customers. Now that e-commerce has become
an accepted part of retailing -- customers spent an estimated $912
million at U.S. Web sites during Thanksgiving week alone -- mystery
shoppers are lurking there too.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't judge an e-commerce site just by looking at the home
page, just like you can't judge a shop by looking at the display
windows," said Lauren Freedman, president of E-Tailing Group Inc.,
the market research firm conducting the study.</TE>
<TE>   "The sites might look great," Freedman added, "but to really know
what's going on, you've got to go inside, ask questions, buy
something and send it back."</TE>
<TE>   Freedman's firm does the best-known mystery shopping survey
online, testing such well-known e-commerce sites as Amazon.com and
Dell.com, as well as smaller players including the Web arm of Omaha
Steaks and art dealer NextMonet.</TE>
<TE>   Of the millions of gift seekers flocking online to make holiday
purchases, Freedman and Magno just may have the best appreciation of
the joys and frustrations of shopping on the Net. Their observations
end up in the hands of hundreds of online retailers desperate to find
an edge in the increasingly cutthroat world of e-commerce.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the process began the first week in September with the
E-Tailing Group staff gathering in its Chicago office to discuss
which 100 sites would get a visit from the mystery shopper.</TE>
<TE>   "We fight over who should be on the list," Magno said. Some sites
that were in last year's survey, such as electronic-gear seller
800.com, were dropped because they went out of business. Others, such
as those of surplus retailer Overstock.com and jeweler Blue Nile,
were tapped to take their place because they have "made big strides
online" or are "doing something unique."</TE>
<TE>   The mystery shopping survey, which is either a shopaholic's dream
come true or an incredibly dreary chore, starts in October with Magno
visiting each site one by one. Once there, she must check more than
100 attributes in a process that takes almost a month to complete.
Magno, 36, does it all herself.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my baby," she said. "I'm a merchant at heart."</TE>
<TE>   Entering a site, she takes notes on how clearly the goods are
displayed and whether the home page is informative without being too
busy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really annoying if there is no white space," said Freedman,
who designed the survey. "Sometimes catalog merchants just lift big
blocks of text and put them on a page. That might work in print, but
it has to be friendly-to-read online."</TE>
<TE>   One of the most important factors is the quality of customer
assistance. Magno checks on such things as the availability of a
toll-free number and how easy it is to find.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't want to feel like they are going it alone when they
visit a site," she said.</TE>
<TE>   This year's mystery shopping survey still is in progress, but last
year only one online retailer was found not to have a toll-free
number: industry giant Amazon.com Inc. of Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Company spokesman Bill Curry said the retailer prefers to answer
consumer inquiries by electronic mail, but he insisted that a
toll-free number is listed on the site. He didn't, however, know
where it was located.</TE>
<TE>   If it's there, it is securely hidden. Magno says she failed to
find it after hours of searching.</TE>
<TE>   If customer service e-mail is available, she sends a message to
test how long it takes to get a reply. Last year, Nordstrom Inc. won
top honors in this category, answering an e-mail in 41 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   But this is one area in which Web service is deteriorating, the
E-Tailing Group surveys have found. In 2000, the average response
time was 14 hours. Last year, it grew to 21 hours, with 18% of
e-mails Magno sent to customer service getting no response at all.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that is partly because the number of people shopping
online grew a lot," she said. It's too soon to know whether the
response time has slipped further this year.</TE>
<TE>   When she considers the selection of merchandise, she does numerous
other checks, including whether a site indicates which items are out
of stock. This feature is becoming increasingly popular; 54% of sites
in the survey offered it last year, up from 42% in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, it's time to place an order. Magno looks for an item
that is not especially costly but still expensive enough to trigger
promotions such as free shipping.</TE>
<TE>   The most she spent for a single item this year was $128 for a
dress at Victoria's Secret. That merchant is far better known for its
undergarments, which is why Magno chose a dress.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to see how they handled that item, like did it come
wrinkled?" she said.</TE>
<TE>   Magno ordered a baby outfit from Gap, a business card holder from
Saks Fifth Avenue, an ear thermometer from drugstore CVS, pajama
bottoms from J. Crew and a teddy bear from 1-800-Flowers.com.</TE>
<TE>   Not only does she take extensive notes, but she also prints every
page she views. A typical file on a site fills about 100 pages.</TE>
<TE>   This might seem like the height of tedium, but Magno -- who used
to be a buyer for major retailers -- doesn't mind the painstaking
work. Shopping is one of her fondest memories of growing up in
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandmother and mother used to take me and my sister to
Marshall Field's on the El," she said. "I'm the biggest impulse
shopper you'll meet. Send me a targeted e-mail with an additional
percentage off and I'm shopping."</TE>
<TE>   Her record keeping becomes especially detailed once she places an
item in her virtual shopping cart. From that point on, Magno times
how long it takes to fill out all necessary forms, choose gift wrap,
go over shipping choices and at last check out.</TE>
<TE>   This part of the process is the most perilous for the online
shopper. Magno has not experienced any complete disasters this year,
but she has encountered several annoyances.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the Web site of Sharper Image Corp. first insisted --
wrongly -- that Magno had not registered. When she tried to
re-register, she said, she was denied because she was already in the
database.</TE>
<TE>   When the site still refused to let her make a purchase, she called
customer service and was told to send an e-mail to the site's
technical support staff. Tech support never got back to her.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives from Sharper Image could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever gift wrapping is available, Magno orders it to test the
quality.</TE>
<TE>   "Some companies charge, and then they send the same box that was
available in the store for free," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest flub last year was from high-end toy merchant FAO
Schwarz Inc., which charged $4.95 for gift wrap and then simply sent
the item in a shopping bag with a red bow on it, Magno said. She
complained and the company refunded the wrapping charge.</TE>
<TE>   An FAO Schwarz spokesman said Magno's version of events was
impossible because the company does not charge for gift wrap. But
Magno says she has the receipt.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, she pays for her purchases with a company credit card
that doesn't list her name and has the items sent to herself. In more
and more cases, a welcome trend then kicks in.</TE>
<TE>   "More and more sites are using order tracking," Freedman said,
referring to services that alert customers by e-mail when
transactions are complete and items sent.</TE>
<TE>   As packages arrive and get evaluated, the returns begin. Some
retailers make it tough, putting callers on hold on a customer
service phone line for long stretches before a return authorization
is issued. Other sites allow shoppers to print a return label on
their own computers.</TE>
<TE>   All the data go into E-Tailing Group's report, which sells for
about $500 and will be available in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Freedman has an inexpensive tip for online
retailers:</TE>
<TE>   "Shop your own site," she said emphatically. "See how easy it is
to use. Take note of the frustrations. You wouldn't believe how many
merchants don't do that."</TE>

<HD>Engineer of a Defense Powerhouse</HD>
<DH>With the TRW deal, Northrop Grumman Chairman Kent Kresa
will have realized his vision for the company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Pae</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Wednesday, if all goes as planned, shareholders will approve
Northrop Grumman Corp.'s $7-billion purchase of TRW Inc., which will
culminate a decade of dazzling deal-making for Northrop's longtime
chairman, Kent Kresa.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after what many consider to be his greatest acquisition,
the 64-year-old Kresa is expected to announce his retirement and turn
over the helm to Ronald D. Sugar, 54, who will be left with a defense
behemoth with interests in virtually every aspect of the nation's
military.</LD>
<LD>   In a remarkable transformation -- much of it engineered by Kresa
-- Northrop will become the nation's second-largest defense firm,
with $26 billion in annual revenue, rivaling No. 1 Lockheed Martin
Corp. and ahead of No. 3 Boeing Co. It will have 120,000 employees
scattered from coast to coast in 44 states and 25 countries.</LD>
<TE>   With TRW -- Kresa's 16th acquisition in eight years -- Century
City-based Northrop will become one of Southern California's largest
companies, employing 24,000 people in El Segundo, Redondo Beach, San
Diego and Palmdale and helping revive the region's once-dominant role
as home to the nation's leading aerospace firms.</TE>
<TE>   "What Kresa did with Northrop is a truly amazing story," said Jack
Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp. "Kresa quietly crafted together one of the most
successful aerospace firms, and he did it ethically."</TE>
<TE>   The company's ascension to the top echelons of the defense
industry is all the more remarkable considering how just a decade
earlier it couldn't do anything right and was on the brink of
elimination.</TE>
<TE>   "Ethically" also wasn't a word that many would have used in those
days when speaking of Northrop.</TE>
<TE>   "They were clearly on the verge of being marginalized," said Jon
B. Kutler, president of aerospace investment bank Quarterdeck
Investment Partners Inc.</TE>
<TE>   When Kresa took the helm in 1990 -- 15 years after joining the
company from the Pentagon's top-secret research and development lab
-- Northrop had 38,000 employees and about $5 billion in revenue and
appeared doomed to become a second-tier supplier. In addition to the
dim business prospects, Northrop's reputation had been severely
tarnished as it moved from one scandal to another in the 1980s,
including selling the Pentagon defective parts and allegedly bribing
officials overseas. There have been no such allegations since Kresa
became chairman.</TE>
<TE>   In a surprising admission, Kresa said last week that Northrop had
come dramatically close to shutting down altogether. "In the early
1990s, we had a critical decision to make," Kresa recalled in an
interview on the corporate jet as he flew back to Los Angeles from a
cross-country road show in which he was touting the TRW acquisition
to institutional investors. "We could just go out of business and
give money back to our shareholders or we could reinvent ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   After extensive internal studies and heated debates, "it became
clear to us we could take the latter path."</TE>
<TE>   It was a bold move because many analysts and investors had written
off the company after it lost two major bids to build new fighter
jets. At the same time, its biggest moneymaker, the B-2 Stealth
Bomber, was being curtailed by budget cuts at the Pentagon.
Originally slated to purchase 132, the Air Force eventually bought
21.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, some executives in the defense industry snickered at
Kresa's appointment. Even-tempered and cerebral, he seemed like the
direct opposite of his predecessor, Thomas V. Jones, the flamboyant
chairman who had ruled Northrop with an iron fist for 27 years.</TE>
<TE>   "When Tom turned it over to Kent, the industry likened it to
George Bush picking Dan Quayle" as a running mate, a longtime
aerospace executive said. "There wasn't much respect for him, so
people were underestimating him. He just wasn't like the other chief
executives."</TE>
<TE>   Kresa said he was keenly aware that he was a different breed from
the old aerospace culture that fueled strong, charismatic leaders.
The chief executives of the 1960s and '70s modeled themselves after
legendary figures who created the nation's aerospace industry -- Jack
Northrop, William Boeing and Simon Ramo, the "R" in TRW.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, I was not part of the original aircraft mafia, so to
speak," Kresa said. "I'm sure that in some ways I was resented, but
in the end it was just a question of proving myself."</TE>
<TE>   Kresa, whose shy demeanor belies an intense competitive streak, is
now one of the most feared executives in the industry, known for his
tenacity and refusal to swallow rejection.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop's breadth of defense work is staggering. If the U.S. goes
to war in Iraq, some piece of Northrop's product line -- from
hardware to software -- will be on virtually every weapon system
deployed there. Aircraft carriers and submarines (built at Northrop's
Newport News, Va., shipyard) to bombers (B-2) and spy satellites
(TRW) will have Northrop's signature.</TE>
<TE>   The TRW acquisition completes the company's transformation, Kresa
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It culminates the vision that I had when I began this job," he
said. "This will be our last major acquisition for a while."</TE>
<TE>   The building began shortly after Kresa took the reins of the
company and began looking ahead. With the end of the Cold War, Kresa
said, it became clear to him and others at Northrop that future
conflicts would be more regional in nature and require highly
sophisticated electronic equipment that would bolster the
effectiveness of existing ships, planes and satellites.</TE>
<TE>   That would mean developing more powerful reconnaissance and
surveillance equipment, as well as weapons with more accurate
guidance systems. Northrop officials predicted that electronic and
information warfare would determine the outcome of battles, as was
eventually shown in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   But Kresa said the company realized early on that it didn't have
the capability to develop those businesses internally.</TE>
<TE>   So he looked outside. "We are a company of immigrants," Kresa
said, noting that only about 10% of Northrop's employees today were
at the company when he began his acquisition binge. He likened
Northrop to the city of New York, where "different heritages are
celebrated and embraced to make the entire city as dynamic as it is."</TE>
<TE>   The first big step was a $2.1-billion hostile bid for Navy
aircraft maker Grumman Corp. in 1994, which at the time was not only
the maker of the F-14 jets of "Top Gun" fame but a leader in
electronic-jamming equipment. The bid came just days after Grumman
had reached a friendly pact to be acquired by then Martin Marietta.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first of several Kresa moves that would rock the
aerospace industry.</TE>
<TE>   He made a similar maneuver last year when Northrop went after
Newport News Shipbuilding Inc., after the military shipbuilder
already had inked a deal with General Dynamics Corp.</TE>
<TE>   A General Dynamics-Newport News merger would have significantly
hurt the shipbuilding business Northrop obtained when it acquired
Woodland Hills-based Litton Industries months earlier for $5.2
billion.</TE>
<TE>   In both cases, Northrop portrayed itself as a jilted victim that
was talking to the partners about a merger only to have them turn
around and hook up with others. Kresa made a similar argument as he
made a surprising offer for TRW earlier this year. Kresa said he had
been talking to TRW about a possible merger since 1996 but that
Northrop was forced to act when TRW Chairman David Cote abruptly
resigned. That led to speculation that TRW had become an acquisition
target.</TE>
<TE>   In all of its acquisitions -- friendly or hostile -- Northrop has
never strayed from its blueprint of creating a defense electronics
powerhouse, Kresa said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always had that vision, and that's why it's easier for us
to pursue a company that we think will fit," he said, adding that his
targets were bought at the "right price, not at any price."</TE>
<TE>   "There is no room for ego," Kresa said.</TE>
<TE>   With the major building blocks in place, it will be up to Sugar,
the company's president and a home-grown engineer, to not only keep
them together but also fine-tune them at a time when defense spending
is expected to rise for the foreseeable future.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Canada but raised in Hawthorne in the shadows of
Northrop's former aircraft plant, Sugar entered UCLA at 17, receiving
a doctorate in engineering by 23. He spent the next 20 years at TRW,
mainly at the Redondo Beach facility, before he left the company to
run Litton in 2000 after he was passed over for TRW's top job.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop acquired Litton in 2001 and named Sugar president. When
the TRW deal is completed, and if Sugar succeeds Kresa as expected,
Sugar will be back as head of TRW.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of those things you ask yourself: How in the world did
this happen?" said Sugar, who added that following Kresa won't be
easy. "They're going to be very big shoes to fill."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>College savings plans come in a variety of flavors, including
so-called 529 plans, Coverdell accounts and Uniform Gift to Minors
Act accounts. Here's a look at the main features of each option:</LD>
<LD>   Tax benefits</LD>
<LD>   * 529: Investments grow tax-deferred, and as long as the money is
used for college, it is free from federal income tax when withdrawn.
Some states provide upfront deductions from state income taxes for
all or a portion of contributions, although California does not offer
this break.</LD>
<TE>   * Coverdell: Investment income grows tax-deferred, and money used
for costs of college, grammar school or high school is tax-free when
withdrawn.</TE>
<TE>   * UGMA: Investment returns are taxed at the child's tax rate.</TE>
<TE>   Tax penalties</TE>
<TE>   * 529: If savings are used for a purpose other than higher
education, the recipient of the funds will be subject to federal
income tax and a 10% penalty. Many states, including California, also
impose penalties for nonqualified withdrawals.</TE>
<TE>   * Coverdell: Same as with 529 plans.</TE>
<TE>   * UGMA: No penalties apply. But the money must be used to aid the
beneficiary.</TE>
<TE>   Annual contribution limits</TE>
<TE>   * 529: None.</TE>
<TE>   * Coverdell: $2,000.</TE>
<TE>   * UGMA: None.</TE>
<TE>   Lifetime contribution limits</TE>
<TE>   * 529: Set by individual states. Currently ranges from $100,000 to
$305,000.</TE>
<TE>   * Coverdell: No specific lifetime limit, but contributions may be
made only until beneficiaries reach age 18.</TE>
<TE>   * UGMA: No limit.</TE>
<TE>   Investment options</TE>
<TE>   * 529: The choices vary by state. California offers five
investment options. Other states offer as few as one or two or more
than a dozen.</TE>
<TE>   * Coverdell: Assets can be invested in almost anything, from
individual stocks and bonds to mutual funds and real estate
investment trusts. Investors can trade within these accounts without
tax consequence.</TE>
<TE>   * UGMA: Also offers a wide range of investment options. But
investment gains are not tax- deferred, so trading within the account
can trigger a tax bill.</TE>
<TE>   Financial aid effect</TE>
<TE>   * 529: Assets are the property of the donor, not the beneficiary,
so the account has a negligible effect on the student's financial aid
eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   * Coverdell: Assets are the property of the beneficiary. That
reduces the student's eligibility for financial aid by about a third
of the value of the account.</TE>
<TE>   * UGMA: Same as Coverdell.</TE>
<TE>   Restrictions/miscellaneous</TE>
<TE>   * 529: Money contributed to a 529 plan for anyone other than
yourself is considered a gift. Normally, tax-free gifts are limited
to $11,000 a year for each recipient. But taxpayers can give up to
five years' worth of annual gifts -- $55,000 -- in one year to a 529
plan.</TE>
<TE>   * Coverdell: The ability to contribute to an account phases out
for singles earning more than $95,000 and married couples earning
more than $190,000 and is eliminated for singles earning more than
$110,000 and married couples earning more than $220,000.</TE>
<TE>   * UGMA: There is no restriction on the use of funds from these
accounts. But once the beneficiaries reach legal age (usually 18 or
21), they gain full control of the account and can use the assets as
they wish -- a possible drawback for parents who don't trust their
children to spend the money wisely.</TE>

<LD>AOL Unveils Web Plan, Warns of Ad Sales Slump</LD>
<LD>   AOL Time Warner Inc. laid down its long-term recovery plan for its
Internet unit, but Wall Street appeared more worried about the
company's short-term financial slump.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of AOL Time Warner fell more than 14% the day after the New
York-based media giant announced that advertising revenue at the
America Online division would drop as much as 50% next year to levels
last seen in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   Now that ad sales are slumping and government investigators are
examining how AOL accounted for some deals, the company is trying to
retrain investors to focus instead on other aspects, including new
content deals and the potential to sell customers premium services.</TE>
<TE>   AOL warned that 2003 overall revenue for the online unit,
including subscriptions and advertising, would be flat and earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization would fall 15%
to 25%. The company said the drop in ad revenue, which could fall
from an estimated $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion this year to as low as
$750 million in 2003, was due chiefly to the expiration of $500
million in long-term ad contracts signed in the dot-com heyday.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's meeting was the first opportunity for new America
Online Chief Executive Jonathan Miller to lay out his strategy for
getting the Internet unit back on track. The plan focuses on beefing
up the online service with features and exclusive content provided by
AOL Time Warner's entertainment properties.</TE>

<TE>   Disney Cuts $47 Million From 4th-Quarter Profit</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co. lopped $47 million off its previously reported
fourth-quarter earnings after its latest film, "Treasure Planet,"
failed to strike gold.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Space Age version of "Treasure Island" had been in
theaters only a few days, last week's announcement shows that Disney
already has written off any hope for the movie: It opened to
generally poor reviews and just $12.1 million at the box office, one
of the weakest openings ever for a Disney animated film.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosure came after Disney announced a series of reforms to
its board. Those changes included a more stringent definition of what
constitutes an "independent" director, but one that also could
diminish the role of businessman Stanley P. Gold, a chief critic of
Disney Chief Executive Michael Eisner.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the Burbank entertainment giant said it was
cooperating with a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
whether it should have publicly revealed earlier than August that
four directors had relatives working for the company or its
affiliates.</TE>
<TE>   Disney said it expects the pretax loss on "Treasure Planet" to
come to $74 million.</TE>

<TE>   Former El Paso Trader Faces Indictment</TE>
<TE>   A former El Paso Corp. energy trader was indicted for allegedly
reporting fictitious natural gas transactions to an industry
publication in an effort to boost prices and company profit. The
action came as part of a broad investigation into whether energy
companies hoodwinked investors and energy ratepayers, including those
in California.</TE>
<TE>   A two-count indictment by a Houston grand jury was unsealed
against Todd Geiger, a vice president on the Canadian natural gas
trading desk for El Paso Merchant Energy, a subsidiary of
Houston-based El Paso Corp. Geiger, 38, was charged with wire fraud
and filing a false report after allegedly telling a trade
publication, Inside FERC Gas Market Report, that he had made 48
natural gas trades Nov. 30, 2001. The trades turned out to be
nonexistent, according to the indictment.</TE>

<TE>   Tenet Slashes Forecast, Plans New Pricing Policy</TE>
<TE>   Tenet Healthcare Corp. slashed its earnings outlook for the next
two years and outlined a new approach to hospital pricing that
includes discounts for uninsured patients.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's second-largest for-profit hospital chain told
financial analysts in New York that about half its earnings growth in
the last two years came from special Medicare reimbursements known as
outliers, which regulators are now auditing. Santa Barbara-based
Tenet has acknowledged that it doubled its outlier payments in the
last two years, to about $750 million last year, by aggressively
raising its hospital charges.</TE>
<TE>   Spurred by Tenet's sizable Medicare outlier payments, the agency
that oversees Medicare said it will step up its scrutiny of hospitals
that generate unusually large outliers. Tom Scully, administrator of
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said hospitals
suspected of inflating their charges to boost outlier payments could
be investigated by the Office of the Inspector General.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet officials said their earnings from operations will range
from $2.38 to $2.78 a share in the current fiscal year. That would
compare to a profit of $2.34 a share in fiscal 2002. Previously, the
company estimated that its current-year earnings would grow by at
least 25%.</TE>

<TE>   Federal Panel Rejects Loan Backing for United</TE>
<TE>   A United Airlines bankruptcy filing became almost certain after a
federal panel rejected a $1.8-billion government loan guarantee that
the carrier needed in order to avoid running out of cash this winter.</TE>
<TE>   Despite United's furious efforts in recent weeks to line up $5.2
billion in labor cost savings to win approval of the bailout, the Air
Transportation Stabilization Board described the airline's recovery
plan as "not financially sound" and said it would not put taxpayers'
money at risk.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the loan backing, "United would face a high probability
of another liquidity crisis within the next few years," the ATSB
said.</TE>
<TE>   UAL Corp.'s United has said it would file under Chapter 11 of the
bankruptcy law without the loan guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said that Elk Grove Village, Ill.-based United probably
would make sharp cuts in its flight schedule as creditors demand that
the carrier scale back to conserve cash. Many of United's 80,000 jobs
-- including some of the 6,500 in Southern California -- would be in
jeopardy, and its union contracts could be scrapped.</TE>

<TE>   U.S. Retailers Report Mixed November Sales</TE>
<TE>   The nation's big retailers reported mixed November sales results
Thursday despite a surge in Thanksgiving weekend shopping, while some
California firms told of solid gains.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at stores open at least a year fell 0.1% last month from a
year earlier, the first such drop in November since at least 1970,
according to Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco-based Gap Inc., parent of Gap, Old Navy and Banana
Republic stores, said same-store sales rose 9% in November, compared
with a 25% decrease in the same period last year. Pacific Sunwear of
California Inc., an Anaheim company that sells casual clothes to
teens, said same-store sales jumped 11.7% last month, while
Industry-based Hot Topic Inc., which sells music-themed apparel and
accessories to teens, said comparable-store sales rose 4.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, sales drooped in November, even among industry
darlings. Wisconsin-based Kohl's Corp., a discount apparel retailer
that plans to open 28 stores in Southern California next spring, said
same-store sales dropped 3.4% for the month.</TE>
<TE>   Discounter Target Corp. of Minneapolis, which operates Target,
Mervyn's and Marshall Field's stores, said comparable-store sales
fell 6.7% from the year before.</TE>

<TE>   Bush Dismisses Two From Economic Team</TE>
<TE>   President George W. Bush dismissed Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill
and White House economic advisor Lawrence Lindsey, shaking up his
economic team amid a faltering recovery. The biggest overhaul of the
2-year-old Bush administration came after the Labor Department
reported that unemployment reached a seven-month high of 6% last
month.</TE>
<TE>   The departures will accelerate Bush's efforts to revive the
economy as he looks ahead to the 2004 elections, investors and
political analysts said. O'Neill resisted calls by some Republican
officials and legislators to deepen tax cuts, urging caution to avoid
adding to the budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   The White House didn't name successors, leaving the
administration's economic and financial team in disarray. Securities
and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt submitted his
resignation in November, and the administration still is looking for
a head for its new accounting oversight board after William Webster
also quit last month.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, who has been focusing on terrorism and a possible attack on
Iraq, wants to avoid the mistakes of his father, George H. W. Bush,
who lost the White House in 1992 because of a weak economy, investors
said. The U.S. has lost more than 1.6 million jobs since March 2001.
Among measures more likely to be pushed are tax cuts for low- and
middle-income consumers and elimination of the double tax on
corporate dividends.</TE>

<HD>High Price for Deregulation</HD>
<DH>United Airlines is paying for a bad system, and so are you,
brother.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So United Airlines' business plan was rejected by the government as
unsound. It's about time. I don't mean just the short-term proposal
offered by the airline in hopes of securing a taxpayer loan. As a
matter of fact, I probably would have voted in favor of such a
bailout just because I wouldn't want to be as uncaring toward airline
workers as many of them have been to me.</LD>
<LD>   No, I'm speaking of the larger business strategy that United and
other carriers have pursued since airlines became the pioneer among
essential-service industries to introduce us to the tortures of
deregulation. That goes back to 1978. President Jimmy Carter promised
"maximum consumer benefits" when he signed the law that allowed the
airline sector of our public transportation system to compete on
prices and service.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't the first time that a president's promise turned out to
be a scalding blast of hot gas. Virtually every year since
deregulation, the airline business has been in one state of chaos or
another. Booming and busting, cramming and jamming, devouring and
disgorging -- it's been quite a ride, hasn't it?</LD>
<TE>   The champions of deregulation insist that this experiment has been
a success. We've supposedly saved billions in travel costs.</TE>
<TE>   Well, maybe. But at what price? Actually, I think the advantages
of airline deregulation are regularly overblown. And the detriments
are seldom weighed anymore, even though they should be.</TE>
<TE>   Check me here, but does it make sense that it may soon cost more
to park your car at the airport than it does to fly off for a weekend
in Las Vegas? True, government regulation can be stifling. But the
story of United et al. should be a lesson that go-for-broke
deregulation can too.</TE>
<TE>   The underlying theory behind airline deregulation was that
competition would make everyone prosper, from investors to airplane
builders to the traveling public. In the immutable mathematics of
Adam Smith, consumers would rule.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it's been a soap opera, and I don't know many travelers
who feel that they've been writing the script. United stock at 93
cents a share? Come on.</TE>
<TE>   I remember a day in San Francisco when it would cost me the same
to fly to Los Angeles or Belgium. Competition? Yes, we have more
airline companies, but few of them have been stable for very long.
The business plans of many airline companies never really envisioned
competition as the final outcome anyway. They approached it as a
dogfight to the death -- undercutting each other and advancing
mergers to try to gain control of the market, first at their
miserable hubs and then beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Now that this idea has proved a bust, the survivors are all
rushing off in another direction -- trying to match discount upstarts
that are using regional airports to cherry-pick profitable routes.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't 24 years of deregulation long enough for a shakeout ride?</TE>
<TE>   Not so long ago, a couple who planned their vacation in advance
wound up spending a fraction of what another traveler paid to hurry
home because Grandpa had a heart attack. Now, the advantage goes to
those daredevils who are willing to wait until the last instant to
scoop up a cut-rate fare for an empty seat. Great fun, I guess, for
those who have nothing better to do than work the tedious system.
They're the ones who change telephone providers 10 times a year to
save $40 and then bore you at cocktail parties with the banalities of
it.</TE>
<TE>   But is this any way to run a railroad, really?</TE>
<TE>   Long ago, by majority rule, we made our decision. Deregulation of
air travel would be about price competition and nothing else. But we
pay for it in discomfort, with anxiety and by indignities that
dehumanize the travel experience. And we're all part of a downward
spiral to depress wages and living standards.</TE>
<TE>   Zealots would have us believe that we could not have achieved any
of this "progress" had we preserved some regulatory control of our
public skies. But I wonder. Somehow, the airline business made it
from tri-motors to jets in partnership with government. Now is as
good a time as any to ask whether we shouldn't reclaim a public hand
in restoring sanity and dependability to a system that has turned on
us and turned us mean.</TE>
<TE>   The crash of United is causing misery for thousands of employees
and their families, as well as investors, travelers and communities
that depend on the company. That's no American success story. It
doesn't have to be this way.</TE>

<HD>Belmont: Faults, but Still Needed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Frank del Olmo</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are fault lines, and then there are fault lines.</LD>
<LD>   And now that a real earthquake fault has been found under the
Belmont Learning Complex, some city school board members may be
tempted to pull the plug -- again -- on a project they never liked.
That would be a mistake. Instead, they must find a safe way to finish
the school, and soon. If not, they could set off new political
tremors along the many social and economic fault lines of Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Conventional wisdom assumes that last week's revelation of the
earthquake faults by school district Supt. Roy Romer was the coup de
grace for a project that has been controversial for years. It was
killed by the board in 1999, only to be resurrected by Romer, with
the passionate support of Latino political activists.</LD>
<TE>   As before, the reasons are as much political as educational.
Although Belmont has been on the school district's drawing boards for
a decade, a new school has been desperately needed in the densely
populated and heavily immigrant neighborhoods west of downtown for at
least 20 years. The old Belmont has 5,000 students crammed onto an
aging campus originally designed for half that many. It was one of
the first schools in the city to go on a year-round calendar because
of overcrowding, yet hundreds of students are still bused every day,
as far away as the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   After years of waiting, there are many frustrated parents -- not
to mention angry students and impatient political activists -- in the
Belmont neighborhood utterly convinced that a school would have been
finished years ago, without this much controversy, if the student
body were predominantly Anglo rather than mostly Latino.</TE>
<TE>   And all the geological surveys and school-safety studies in the
world will not overcome the suspicion many of those people now share
that the sudden discovery of earthquake faults at the Belmont site is
awfully convenient. It provides political cover for the paternalistic
school reformers who control the Los Angeles Unified School District
just three months before they stand for reelection. They get the
chance to kill a controversial project they had criticized as a
bureaucratic boondoggle in their last campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, I do not share the cynical suspicions that the
earthquake faults are being used as an excuse to kill Belmont once
and for all. The preliminary findings of the geologists the LAUSD
hired to study earthquake risks at the Belmont site are persuasive.
There are many faults under the eastern side of the 45-acre school
site, and one runs directly beneath two unfinished buildings. Under
state laws that prohibit the construction of schools within 50 feet
of known quake faults, those buildings must now be abandoned, at
least for use as school facilities. But that does not mean giving up
on the whole project, because the same geologic surveys found that 12
acres on the western side of the Belmont site are "unfaulted and
unfractured." They are also far enough away from known faults to
allow for school construction.</TE>
<TE>   That is where the LAUSD should start building a new Belmont High
School, one smaller than the 3,500-student campus that was envisioned
when ground was broken for the project in the early '90s.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, a smaller Belmont would not solve all of the school
overcrowding problems in the neighborhood. There is still a need for
new school sites in and around downtown. And board member Jose
Huizar, in whose district Belmont sits, points out that it has been
hard to find even five-acre sites. But at least finishing a Belmont
High on the current site would be a gesture of good faith to a
community that has been badly served by LAUSD decision makers for far
too long.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, don't look for members of the area's Latino community
to join in the panicky response to the discovery of earthquake
faults, although they are deeply disappointed by this latest twist in
the long Belmont saga. They know that reports of Belmont's death have
been greatly exaggerated before.</TE>

<LD>Today, the homily at Mass in Catholic churches across California will
contain the following admonition: Thou shalt not revive old child
abuse cases in a way that violates timeless principles of due process
and basic fairness.</LD>
<LD>   An extraordinary California law, contrary to most U.S.
constitutional and common law, will take effect Jan. 1. The law
literally creates new civil damage liability where none previously
existed. Yet it is elementary civics that government should not be
able to retroactively penalize on Tuesday that which was unpunishable
on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   California's attempt to impose retroactive criminal liability in
an unrelated case is being skeptically reviewed by the U.S. Supreme
Court. Insofar as the Constitution's ex post facto clause has been
understood since 1787 as not permitting such things, the odds that
California will prevail on appeal are slim. As Judge Learned Hand
once said, "To revive a prosecution already dead ... [is contrary] to
our instinctive feelings of justice and fair play." The bishops think
the same principle should apply to retroactive civil liability.</LD>
<TE>   Under current law, abuse victims must sue by their 26th birthday
or within three years of discovering emotional problems linked to the
abuse. With the law approved this year, those rules are simply tossed
out the window. For one year, lawsuits can be filed for failure to
prevent alleged abuse, no matter how long ago it occurred and how
long ago existing laws had closed the books on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Though the legislation doesn't mention the Catholic Church by
name, it might as well have been labeled the Let's Get Those Bishops
Bill. The anti-Catholic sentiment is evident in the legislative
history and by the fact that under the law, the abuser is not subject
to suit. Only the church is made newly liable.</TE>
<TE>   As a Catholic, I have been sickened by the revelations of sexual
misconduct by priests. True, only a small fraction of priests have
been accused; in fact, fewer than 1%. Many of the allegations are
decades old, and some have been patently false.</TE>
<TE>   Yet child abuse, whenever it occurred, is morally inexcusable. Not
only that, but it is a threat to what always has been a mainstay of
the church: unequivocal support for the family as the first vital
cell of civilization.</TE>
<TE>   Given that the repulsive nature of the behavior was initially met
by some church authorities with arrogance, it might seem easy to
acquiesce in the California Legislature's desire to "get" the church.
Yet the Catholic Church is embodied by no single bishop or priest. It
is the body of Christ that consists of the abundant love poured out
by millions of religious and lay people in schools, hospitals and
shelters.</TE>
<TE>   No amount of good can excuse grave evil. But no trial lawyer can
say with a straight face that insurance will cover the losses of
newly created liability without harming much-needed church activity.
The policy limits of decades ago reflect the knowledge of that time,
not the present. Most important, however, is the duty incumbent on
all of us to play by one set of rules, which are generally applied
and announced in advance.</TE>
<TE>   The Catholic Church must scrupulously observe the responsible
internal procedures it has created to deal with current allegations
of abuse. It also must fairly compensate those who have suffered
injury and brought their cases under accepted principles of law.
Nevertheless, the church, as citizen, still retains the right to ask
that the Constitution be observed.</TE>
<TE>   The American Civil Liberties Union makes this point all the time
for criminal defendants. Surely those following the example of St.
Francis or Mother Teresa deserve as much.</TE>

<HD>Taxpayers Get Soaked Under Federal Water Plan</HD>
<DH>Southern Californians, you helped foot the bill. Now keep
your hand on your wallet as subsidized farms let it flow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Wall</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Keep your hand on your wallet, Southern California. First, you have
the Bush administration threatening to take away some of your
Colorado River water supply. Then the same administration is
simultaneously planning a massive water giveaway to California rice
growers. In fact, the administration is offering even more free water
than the growers need.</LD>
<LD>   What will they do with the extra water? Don't be surprised if the
growers sell it to you for a handsome profit.</LD>
<LD>   How can this be? Remember that California has taken more than its
fair share of water from the Colorado River for decades. That has
meant less water for Arizona and Nevada. As those states' populations
grew, they began to complain and insist that California live within
its allotment.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of Interior now says Southern California will
have to cut back. The only question is whether you will be weaned
slowly or lose the water all at once.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid a sudden cutoff, officials are racing to meet a Dec. 31
deadline to negotiate a complex water sale. If the deal goes through,
San Diego County will pay Imperial Valley farmers about $2 billion
for enough water to supply 400,000 families. That's how much people
are willing to pay for this valuable resource, which brings us back
to the rice growers and the very different deal that's on their
table.</TE>
<TE>   The administration is quietly finalizing its offer to renew
40-year water contracts with the rice growers and other agricultural
interests in the Sacramento River Valley. The contracts are for more
than 2 million acre-feet (an acre-foot is the volume of irrigation
water that would cover one acre to a depth of one foot) from the
federally owned Central Valley Project. That's three times what the
entire city of Los Angeles uses each year and 10 times what San Diego
will get from the Imperial Valley deal. Under the proposed contracts,
almost all the water is free. A small portion will cost around $30
per acre-foot, about one-tenth of the unit cost that San Diego will
pay Imperial Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The rice growers' deal gets even better. Not only do taxpayers
subsidize their water, they also subsidize their crops. Many of these
farms are huge agribusinesses receiving millions of dollars per year.
The crop and water subsidies are corporate welfare. The subsidies
encourage growers to raise low-value crops like rice and provide no
incentive for water conservation.</TE>
<TE>   Forty years ago, when the contracts were first negotiated,
California had barely 10 million people. We didn't realize that
unchecked irrigation would devastate drinking water supplies,
wildlife, the fishing industry and recreation. Today, the state's
population exceeds 34 million. We have dry rivers, contaminated
ground water and salmon endangered with extinction.</TE>
<TE>   Water is such a scarce commodity that ideas formerly considered
outlandish -- like taking salt out of seawater -- are now considered
potentially cost-effective. New times require new contracts. Yet
while the rest of California is trying to wring out every last drop
of precious water supplies, the rice producers are being offered more
than they need. How much more? According to five years of Bush
administration data, it's an average of 560,000 acre-feet of federal
water supply untouched per year.</TE>
<TE>   What will the growers do with all the excess water? They will try
to sell it to you, thirsty Southern California. And they're watching
to see how much San Diego pays the Imperial Valley farmers. If they
charge the same price, then their profit could be in the billions of
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing wrong with developing a genuine water market. It
can encourage farmers to conserve. But the Sacramento River rice
producers are not acquiring their water on the free market; they are
getting it at taxpayers' expense and then trying to sell it back at a
steep markup.</TE>
<TE>   It's nothing less than robbery when tax dollars are used to
subsidize wasteful farming practices at the expense of our wallets,
clean drinking water and healthy rivers.</TE>

<HD>The Search for Consciousness May Remain an Elusive Dream</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With all due respect to Francis H.C. Crick ("Francis Crick's Quest,"
by Michael A. Hiltzik, Nov. 17), many of his ideas about
consciousness suffer from the fact that he has chosen to study
something that, in large part, lies outside his area of expertise.
Consciousness, whatever it is, will not be understood primarily at
the level of neurons. Any behavioral phenomenon, especially one that
is so dependent on learning, must first be understood in terms of its
function in the environment. But Crick has taken the opposite
approach--first trying to understand the neural correlates. In so
doing, he has put the cart before the horse.</LD>
<LD>   Although the article states that one of Crick's "most important
contributions" has been the deferral of the definition of
consciousness, this is at odds with how science approaches other
phenomena, such as the structure of DNA for which Crick and his
colleagues were recognized. Asking where conscious thought resides in
the brain--without first knowing what conscious thought is--will
produce no answers. Because of this and other problems, Crick and his
team will fail, just as philosophers for centuries have failed. They
will not find consciousness in the brain or anywhere else.</LD>

<TE>   I had that Yogi Berra deja vu feeling all over again while reading
about Crick's efforts to locate consciousness in the brain's neural
mechanisms. Presented as the latest in scientific inquiry, the
question of whether matter generates consciousness was mused upon
thousands of years ago by schools of Indian philosophy, and it has
been a hot topic among eggheads ever since.</TE>
<TE>   It's possible that Crick's neurons are so exquisitely tuned on
this issue that they will succeed where centuries of other neurons
have failed. But take a look at contemporary research that shows the
survival of human consciousness after bodily death. If Uncle Ed or
Aunt Martha's "souls" continue after their brain neurons have stopped
firing, it would seem that Crick and his colleagues have been looking
in the wrong direction.</TE>

<TE>   From the beginning of time, the mysteries of life stimulated our
imagination, which was expressed in greatness--greatness in art,
music, literature and storytelling. Children grew up with mysteries
told to them by their grandparents in the form of legends and
parables, and they would dream. In those dreams great journeys were
made. It may be that we will gain the knowledge of how we think and
why we believe. But in that gain we will certainly lose something
more important: the awe and wonder for our world and for each other.</TE>

<LD>I am sick of hearing about the struggle of those who attempt to enter
the U.S. illegally ("Thirst," by Susan Straight, Nov. 17). Yes, it is
difficult. Did you think you were the only ones to struggle? What
about all of the other immigrants to this country? Do you think they
rolled off the boat to a middle-class life of privilege and rounds of
golf? Do you think they immediately sent their children to college?</LD>
<LD>   After you have paid your dues, and the blood of your fathers and
sons and husbands has been shed for this country, cry to me. The
people who traverse the desert are willing to die to get here. Join
the crowd. Many others have died to come to this free country. They
understand the risks.</LD>

<LD>It's housecleaning time at the White House. The resignations of
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and top advisor Lawrence B.
Lindsey don't signal radical change, but they probably amount to more
than the superficial scrubbing that critics have been predicting. If
President Bush trusts his new advisors and receives sensible
proposals, he could modify his tax policies in ways that would better
lift the economy out of the doldrums.</LD>
<LD>   It's hard to avoid the suspicion that the forced resignations were
precipitated by news that unemployment had reached 6%. All along, the
White House has been worried that Bush could be vulnerable in his
reelection race, as his father was, to the charge of ignoring the
nation's economic ills. Bush waited until he had no choice but to
dismiss Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt.</LD>
<TE>   In contrast with his foreign policy advisors, Bush's economic team
has been glaringly inept. O'Neill, a former chief executive at Alcoa,
never came close to earning the bipartisan confidence enjoyed by a
predecessor, Robert E. Rubin, on Wall Street and Capitol Hill.
O'Neill repeatedly made controversial and inappropriate remarks about
the health of the economy, the strength of the dollar and the state
of the stock market. He seemed indifferent to the prospect of a
recession, sounding like Herbert Hoover when he declared that
"markets go up and down." He characterized Enron's bankruptcy as a
tribute to the "genius of capitalism."</TE>
<TE>   Lindsey, who drafted the tax cut plan on which Bush ran in 2000,
was seen as a poor salesman for administration policy.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is wedded to sweeping tax cuts and will not willingly abandon
their heavy weighting toward the wealthy, but a fresh set of advisors
could persuade him to pump money more swiftly into the economy.
Newcomers with the bipartisan support that Rubin enjoyed could work
with Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), who has offered a recovery
plan that seems in sync with White House thinking. It calls for a
short-term business tax credit for investments in information
technology and a payroll tax credit for hiring new employees.
Business investment has sunk to an annual average of minus 7.6%, and
the economy will continue to stall until it returns to plus
territory.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also should start lobbying for restoration of temporary
extended unemployment benefits for almost a million workers who will
be cut off a few days after Christmas. Unlike tax rate reductions,
such outlays stimulate the economy swiftly because they're spent as
quickly as they're received.</TE>
<TE>   A Treasury secretary who speaks with a steady voice, rather than
shooting from the hip or simply embracing the status quo, will also
have a calming effect on the economy -- as would getting the right,
and an upright, replacement for Pitt.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has disposed of the front men for his economic problems. If
he puts advisors of real substance in their place, worried consumers
could see immediate benefits and the president could get the lift he
seeks in 2004.</TE>

<LD>News from London's Royal National Theatre of a new opera based on the
life of sleaze-TV host Jerry Springer raises questions about British
sanity and drinking water but also suggests possibilities for other
operas on this side of the Colorado River. According to news reports,
"Jerry Springer: The Opera" is funny and features costumed louts
shouting epithets, a male singer wearing naught but a diaper and a
chorus line of dancing Ku Klux Klansmen. The opera thus seeks to
capture the nous ne savons quoi of Springer's syndicated TV show,
where these sorts cavort, curse, confess and pummel each other,
incited by a taunting studio audience. "It's exactly the kind of work
the National should be doing," said Nicholas Hytner, the director.</LD>
<LD>   "I like the moral dilemmas the Jerry Springer show poses for the
people who watch it and the people who are on it," said Richard
Thomas, the opera's composer.</LD>
<LD>   Uh-huh. Such thinking helps explain the gap that caused the
American Revolution. But whether such British humour translates to
American humor and whether folks will pay a fistful of pounds to
dress up and look down on actors misbehaving like real Americans on
TV won't be known until the April opening at the Lyttelton Theatre,
where seats are bolted to the floor.</LD>
<TE>   The new Springer production does open other opera opportunities. A
very long, boring opera about a family named Osbourne in which every
word of every lyric is bleeped. A 27-, no, 28-act epic chronicling
L.A.'s love-hate feelings about pro football in which a developer and
a lawyer sing the yet-to-be-famed duet, "Bella Stadia Profitorium."</TE>
<TE>   A three-act opera about port development featuring a chorus of
arbitrators and dock workers in newly nonpolluting foreign boats
(with Chinese surtitles projected above the stage). A four-hour opera
about freeway congestion, with bumper-to-bumper singers never moving.
This is performed only weekdays from 5 until 9 a.m. and 3:30 until
7:30 p.m. A two-act tragedy about a basketball team of giants whose
star player postpones toe surgery so he can skip training camp. A
six-act budgetary drama (cut to four) involving a governor in a
castle feigning anguish over raising taxes, besieged by dueling
choruses of partisan legislators. This one ends with the suicide by
sword of everyone onstage, including numerous TV crews.</TE>
<TE>   Also under development in this new age of appropriate drama is a
light musical about the critical fiscal condition of urban trauma
care.</TE>

<LD>The No Child Left Behind Act was meant to close the gap between
failing students and academic achievers. But it was supposed to
accomplish that by improving badly run schools, not by harming
successful ones.</LD>
<LD>   The Education Department flabbergasted school officials recently
with a directive on parental choice, one aspect of the school reform
law: Students at the lowest-performing schools can transfer to a
better school in the same district even if it's full. Even if that
means filling the schoolyard with portables or increasing class
sizes. The only exception is if the crowding would violate safety
codes.</LD>
<LD>   The main purpose of the rule is to give parents more clout. It's
true that the balance of power between schools and parents tilts
almost totally toward the schools and needs to shift. Educators
cannot moan about the lack of parent involvement and then give
parents no voice -- or choice. It's unfair to keep ambitious students
stuck in dysfunctional schools by allowing districts to hang a
"Sorry, No Vacancy" sign on every campus the kids might want to
attend. Many supposedly full campuses could and would take extra
students who moved within their boundaries, yet somehow cannot find a
seat for a student from across town.</LD>
<TE>   Still, think of what this rule could do to the high-wire act of
running a crowded urban district such as Los Angeles Unified, where
about 150,000 students would probably qualify for transfer. It's hard
to see the benefit in turning good campuses into cramped encampments
and in rewarding a successful principal and fine faculty by dumping
more work and bigger class sizes on them.</TE>
<TE>   The architects of this strange approach to improving education
point out that most parents want their children to attend a nearby
school. It's unlikely, they say, that many parents will put in for
transfers, especially if their preferred school already is jammed
with transfer students and running bigger classes.</TE>
<TE>   What a concept: Make a good school so unattractive that no one
will want to send children to it. Indeed, few parents now apply for
student transfers. But the new law has gone into operation and
there's no knowing how parents will react over time to the news that
they have a right to demand a transfer.</TE>
<TE>   The rule's backers also argue that it will force districts into
shoring up their weakest schools. Fix 'em or face mass transfers, the
message would go. There are more effective and less destructive ways
to make changes, and the reform law contains some of those.
Consistently failing schools might see a change in personnel or be
forced to spend some of their federal money on private tutoring
services.</TE>
<TE>   Education Secretary Rod Paige is fond of saying the law aims to
aid educators, not be at odds with them. This helping hand is hard to
see in mandates that could end up punishing well-run schools.</TE>

<LD>"How the Grinch Stole Christmas"</LD>
<LD>   By Dr. Seuss</LD>
<LD>   This book rhymes on almost every single page. It is about a Grinch
who hates Christmas. He has put up with it for 58 years. Nobody knows
why he hates Christmas. It could be that his head was not sewed on
just right. But the reason I think is that his heart was two sizes
too small. I think you should read this book!</LD>

<TE>   Stanley Yelnats is a regular boy. Until one day, police arrest him
for stealing a famous baseball player's shoes. It's either go to jail
or Camp Green Lake.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley's parents choose to send him to Camp Green Lake. This camp
has no greenery, lots of lizards, snakes and tons of holes.</TE>
<TE>   Every day they must dig a hole 5 feet deep and 5 feet wide. But

<LD>Melissa looked out the cabin window.</LD>
<LD>   "Look, Heather," she said to her sister, "there's lots of new
snow."</LD>
<LD>   Once it began to snow in the mountains above Los Angeles, Heather,
Melissa and their parents, their Uncle Andrew and their cousins Adam
and Jeremy, spent most weekends in the mountain cabin that they
owned.</LD>
<TE>   "Dad, are Adam and Jeremy coming up?" Heather asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," her father said. "But they won't be here until around
noon."</TE>
<TE>   "Melissa," Heather said, "let's not wait for them. Let's make our
snow angels now."</TE>
<TE>   "All right," Melissa said.</TE>
<TE>   The two girls went outside and lay down on the snow with their
arms and legs stretched out as far as they would go. Slowly they
moved their arms and legs across the snow. Then, carefully so as not
to disturb the images, they got up.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the best snow angels we've ever made," Heather said.</TE>
<TE>   Melissa agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when their cousins Adam and Jeremy were there, Heather
said, "We each made a snow angel before you came and they're
terrific. Bet you can't make any as good."</TE>
<TE>   "Of course we can," Adam said. He grabbed his jacket. "Come on
Jeremy!"</TE>
<TE>   And the four of them went outside.</TE>
<TE>   "Melissa!" Heather said. "Look! There's an extra angel!"</TE>
<TE>   "Who made it?" Jeremy asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I bet you did," Melissa said, "before you came into the cabin."</TE>
<TE>   "No, I didn't!" Jeremy protested.</TE>
<TE>   "Neither did I," Adam said.</TE>
<TE>   "Well then, who did?" Heather asked. "We're the only kids around!"</TE>
<TE>   Just then someone said, "Hi!"</TE>
<TE>   They all turned around and saw a boy standing in front of the door
of the cabin next to theirs.</TE>
<TE>   "I watched you make your snow angels," the boy said, "and it
looked like fun. So I made one too." Then he said, "My name's Eric."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm Melissa," Melissa said. "And this is my sister, Heather, and
these are our cousins, Adam and Jeremy."</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been up in the snow before," Eric said. "Are there
other things to do besides making snow angels?"</TE>
<TE>   Heather laughed. "Lots!" she said. "We'll show you!"</TE>
<TE>   And they did.</TE>

<HD>The Role of Race in College Admissions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re the Supreme Court agreeing to rule on whether colleges may
consider students' race in deciding admissions, Dec. 3: The court
accepted two cases from the University of Michigan, which gives
"bonus points" to black and Hispanic applicants. However, the term
"Hispanic" is not based on race but is a classification based on
language; Hispanics are from all races.</LD>
<LD>   If the court rules that "race" should be a factor in determining
college admissions, are white Hispanics not going to be given points
because they are white? On the other hand, if the court determines
that race should not be a factor, are the white Hispanics supposed to
benefit as opposed to Hispanics of other races? Should not the issue
be whether disadvantaged students of any race should be given some
priority in admissions?</LD>

<TE>   Re "Back to the Admissions Morass," Commentary, Dec. 4: In the
Supreme Court's Bakke decision, only Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr.
concluded that race could be used to obtain a heterogeneous student
body. Powell's diversity rationale was not binding precedent because
it has never represented the view of a majority of the Supreme Court
in Bakke or any other case.</TE>

<HD>Priests' Sex Abuse Cases Hit the Legal System</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Your Dec. 3 editorial, "Church in Murky Waters," is biased and
sophomoric. You have strongly urged and supported the fact that
clerics in the Catholic Church should be subject to the legal system
that applies to all of us. I and most Catholics would agree with
this. Why do you now take the position that the church should not be
entitled to avail itself of that same legal system that, through the
bankruptcy laws, attempts to protect entities so that they might
survive economically? Certainly you must be aware that the trial
lawyers will push this situation until the Catholic Church is no
longer able to serve its members and provide services in many areas
to people of all faiths.</LD>

<TE>   I am a practicing Catholic who would welcome an explanation of why
the church did not let parishioners in on the fact that Gov. Gray
Davis did not veto the bill passed in June that changed the statute
of limitations regarding sexual abuse. After all, "in reality, the
vast majority of Catholic assets belong to the people" (Dec. 3). The
poor and those in need would not have supported anyone, not even a
Democrat, who favored a bill that would so affect the church's
ability with regard to works of charity, education, worship and the
sacraments. The church had the power to change the passage of the
bill and/or the outcome of the election. Its leaders should have been
whipping up the legislators and the governor at the time the bill was
being considered, rather than the parishioners after the fact.</TE>

<HD>To Address L.A.'s Gangs, Know the Territory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "City Declares War on Gangs," Dec. 4: If LAPD Chief William
Bratton hopes to generate a lot of symbolic excitement surrounding
the topic of gangs, then he's done excellent work so far. As far as
actually addressing the gang issue, however, Bratton will soon find
that locking everybody up has never worked in L.A. and never will.</LD>
<LD>   His plan to attack gangs as he attacked the Mafia in New York is
structurally misguided. Gangs in L.A. are not hierarchical. Their
leadership is anarchic. That there is no president of all gangs or
even sometimes of single gangs makes them difficult to attack in a
top-down manner.</LD>
<LD>   Paradoxically, increased penal sentences only tend to strengthen
street-to-prison networks -- and prison itself has helped to create
entities that unfortunately do resemble the Mafia: prison gangs.
Their power will only grow with the punitive tactics the chief is
proposing.</LD>
<TE>   Gangs in Los Angeles are here to stay. Hope remains in the fact
that gang members often agree that they are caught up in cycles of
violence they cannot control. Finding ways to bridge these worlds
through education, employment, community development and local
leadership is a much more difficult job. I want to know if the chief
is up to the task of actually learning about L.A. gangs and taking
appropriate steps that require commitment and understanding rather
than shortsighted condemnation. For all of our sakes, I hope he is.</TE>

<TE>   Re "In Gangs' Territory, a Weary Hope," Dec. 5: As long as people
like Father Greg Boyle coddle gang members, most of whom never pay
for the murders and terror they bring to the community, and as long
as parents teach their kids to fear and distrust the police, the
"cycle of gang violence" will continue. Organized or disorganized,
these gangs are made up of sociopaths with no concern for human life
(other than their own). Hurray for Bratton -- let's all support him.
It couldn't get any worse.</TE>

<LD>Inspections in Iraq have started. So far, the Iraqis appear to be
complying with the demands of the U.N. Security Council resolution.
Most of us breathed a sigh of relief. Unfortunately, it has become
clear that the ultra-hawks in the Bush administration -- Vice
President Dick Cheney, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and
Richard Perle -- will not take yes for an answer. While the rest of
the world thinks Iraq has backed down, these men are beginning a
massive public relations blitz for war.</LD>
<LD>   It is clear they are prepared to declare Iraq in default of the
U.N. resolution even if the inspectors find no evidence of weapons of
mass destruction. Cheney has said the absence of evidence is not the
same as the absence of weapons. Bush and his war hawks declare they
know of such weapons in Iraq but have offered us not one iota of
evidence. But with the possibility of a peaceful resolution to this
crisis at hand, we cannot allow a few men to push the world to war.
We must send a message to the White House to let the inspections
work.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Iraq's Apparent Compliance Fails to Lift Regional Anxiety,"
Dec. 4: If it's true, as Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld says, that
"any country on the face of the Earth with an active intelligence
program [including, specifically, the U.S. and the U.K.] knows that
Iraq has weapons of mass destruction," perhaps there is a good reason
for not sharing that intelligence with the American public. But if
they have this unassailable knowledge, shouldn't they tell the U.N.
inspectors where to look?</TE>

<TE>   Re "Turks, Saudis Offer to Assist a War on Iraq," Dec. 4: The
price for Turkey's acquiescence and assistance in the Bush
administration's war on Iraq, buried near the end of the article, is
"billions and billions of dollars," according to an unnamed senior
Western diplomat. "And I think we're going to pay it," he adds. I now
await an announcement that the oil industry is stepping forward to
finance this exorbitant bribe, thereby sparing American taxpayers the
cost. I fear it will be a long wait.</TE>

<TE>   The appointment of Zalmay Khalilzad as special envoy, first to
Afghanistan and now to "free Iraqis," blatantly exposes the Bush
administration's real intentions regarding the two countries ("Bush
Names Envoy for 'Free Iraqis,' " Dec. 3).</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, Khalilzad was an advisor for Unocal, conducting
risk analyses on the proposed 890-mile, $2-billion natural gas
pipeline project through Afghanistan. Khalilzad joined meetings with
Taliban officials hosted at Unocal's headquarters in Sugar Land,
Texas, in December 1997. Unocal had to halt its plans in 1998, after
the United States bombed Afghanistan, but now the pipeline is on
again as a "reconstruction" project, this time without Unocal.</TE>
<TE>   Khalilzad's assignment reveals that perhaps the Bush
administration's real goal in Afghanistan was not so much to root out
Al Qaeda as to install a regime -- President Hamid Karzai also was a
consultant for Unocal -- to help U.S. oil companies get at the large
oil and gas reserves in the Caspian Basin. With the Afghan pipeline
project moving ahead, Khalilzad's next job might be to help "free
Iraqis" manage their oil production. That is, provided Saddam Hussein
doesn't nuke those oil fields when Bush invades.</TE>

<LD>The Times got it exactly right in its Dec. 3 editorial, "Stockpiles
of Terror." The U.S. cannot afford to ignore the unattended piles of
Russian nuclear and chemical arms left over from the Cold War. I was
disappointed to see that one of California's own representatives,
Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine), is proposing a policy that would
increase America's insecurity.</LD>
<LD>   Hunter must be made to realize that a foreign policy that would
truly make Americans safer includes disarming and reducing worldwide
stockpiles of nuclear weapons. I trust that his California colleagues
on the Armed Services Committee, including Reps. Loretta Sanchez
(D-Garden Grove) and Susan Davis (D-San Diego), will work to show him
the error of his ways.</LD>

<AU>William M. Arkin</AU>
<BD>William M. Arkin is a military affairs analyst who
writes regularly for Opinion. E-mail: warkin@igc.org.</BD>
<DL>SOUTH POMFRET, Vt.</DL>
<LD>On April 30, 2001, more than 30 square miles of the rolling Maryland
countryside that make up the Aberdeen Proving Grounds were cleared of
all nonessential personnel for the first full-scale test of a new
weapon. Planners also took care to remove all unnecessary electronic
equipment, because electronic equipment was exactly what the new
weapon was designed to destroy.</LD>
<LD>   At 6:13 p.m., the antenna on the exotic new device was switched on
and a high-powered beam of microwaves was fired at a nearby truck --
the first field deployment of a "directed energy" weapon. It fried
the truck's ignition and air-fuel mixing system, bringing the hapless
vehicle to a halt.</LD>
<LD>   About the same time, at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico,
field demonstrations were being wrapped up on another microwave
weapon, this one mounted on a truck and designed to inflict intense
pain on human skin. The weapon sprang from a program devoted to what
military researchers call "active-denial technology."</LD>
<TE>   Now, a year and a half later, an enormous effort is underway to
move these speed-of-light weapons from the realm of research to
combat readiness. The same is true for an array of exotic new
weapons, including new generations of so-called "agent defeat" bombs.
Among the latter is a guided cluster bomb that scatters 4,000
titanium rods capable of penetrating chemical and biological bunkers
and storage tanks with lethal effect. Most promising is a new
incendiary device that generates a firestorm so intense it cannot be
quenched with water.</TE>
<TE>   What lies behind this rush to bring these exotic new weapons into
the American arsenal is the Bush administration's almost obsessive
determination to eradicate nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
in Iraq -- and potentially in other rogue states -- as part of its
war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The new devices, along with the development of highly secret
special operations units and new tactics, are intended to help the
armed forces seize or neutralize the so-called weapons of mass
destruction (WMD) with greater speed and security -- as well as with
less damage to surrounding areas or people, and less danger of
inadvertently spreading toxic materials.</TE>
<TE>   There are risks, however, because some of these new weapons could
arguably be construed as violating established codes of wartime
conduct. And the risks of a backlash, whether at home or abroad, are
magnified by the administration's almost total refusal to talk about
what it is doing and thereby build public understanding and support.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, one side effect of framing the war on terrorism in
terms of weapons of mass destruction is that it instills in
government officials a sense of moral certainty so great that they
feel no need to explain or justify themselves.</TE>
<TE>   And, for all the talk of withering airstrikes on thousands of
Iraqi targets and of armored divisions racing toward Baghdad, what
really distinguishes Washington's preparation for war with Iraq is
its focus on finding and destroying Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul D. Wolfowitz made this crystal
clear last week when he said, "Our goal is to achieve the disarmament
of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, peacefully if possible,
voluntarily if possible, by force if necessary."</TE>
<TE>   And the administration clearly sees high-powered microwave, or
HPM, weapons and other such devices as potentially useful in
achieving that goal. When Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld was
asked at an August press briefing how promising he considered HPM
technology, he replied in his characteristically elliptical way by
recalling the unexpected emergence of unmanned aerial drones in the
Afghanistan war.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know," he said. Drones "that were used in Afghanistan
had not reached their full development. In the normal order of
things, when you invest in research and development, you don't have
any intention or expectations that one would use it. On the other
hand, the real world intervenes from time to time."</TE>
<TE>   The real world that drives current war planning is the absolute
imperative of thwarting Iraqi use of chemical or biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   For many years, the military and the defense industry have dreamed
of directed-energy weapons -- lasers, microwaves and electromagnetic
pulses that would operate in milliseconds and leapfrog over the
current generations of conventional and nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Microwave weapons work by producing an intense surge of energy,
like a lightning bolt, that short-circuits electrical connections,
interferes with computer motherboards, destroys memory chips and
damages other electronic components. As antipersonnel weapons,
active-denial HPMs send a narrow beam of energy that penetrates about
1/64th of an inch into the skin, where nerves that cause pain are
located. By instantaneously heating the skin to above 50 degrees
Centigrade (122 degrees Fahrenheit), the microwaves inflict intense
pain; often, the reaction they produce is panic. "All the glossy
slide presentations in the world cannot prepare you for what to
expect when you step in the beam," a high-ranking officer commented
last year after experiencing it. His account was contained in
military documents.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the attacks of Sept. 11, these and other highly
classified HPM prototypes are being evaluated for use against
facilities involving weapons of mass destruction. "We are looking for
a boutique of capabilities," Sue Payton, deputy undersecretary of
Defense for advanced systems and concepts, told the Pentagon press
corps in March, describing the agent-defeat mission. HPMs are being
tested against mock targets with the hope of being able to disable
them with a minimum of blast effects, civilian death or external
physical damage, military sources say.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, HPM weapons technology has now returned to its nuclear
roots. In the mid-1980s, the Air Force's Strategic Air Command called
for a new weapon able to protect storage bunkers from mobs of
anti-nuclear protesters. A "repel demonstrator" device using
high-powered microwaves was built and tested in 1996. The focus of
the program shifted to crowd control missions for places such as
Somalia and Bosnia; two vehicle-mounted prototypes were tested in New
Mexico and built before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   While these devices can perform at close quarters, developers of
long-range HPM weapons still have had to overcome huge problems in
making them combat-ready. They require large power sources. They are
small and lack ruggedness. And they have a tendency to inadvertently
harm friendly forces.</TE>
<TE>   In April 1999, the Joint Command and Control Warfare Center
oversaw the first military HPM weapon successfully demonstrated
against electronics on a small scale. The prototype was described at
the time as "elegant, safe, well built, and user friendly." Last
October, a Defense Department briefing extolled its ability to stop
vehicles at hundreds of meters, and military sources hint that at
least three different prototypes are available for what might be
one-time use in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, the Pentagon has not put all its eggs in the technology
basket. It is training special combat units too.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, the mission of the U.S. Special Operations Command
has focused on combating terrorism and countering weapons as dual
priorities. The command's mission, according to Defense Department
documents, is to "prevent/limit/minimize the development, possession
and employment of weapons of mass destruction [and] to seize,
destroy, render safe, capture or recover WMD [weapons of mass
destruction]."</TE>
<TE>   The use of Special Forces in this role actually has its roots in
the Cold War, when the still-top-secret Delta Force was created. In
fact, its first "certifying" exercise, code-named Joshua Junction,
took place at a mock nuclear weapons facility on Jackass Flats at the
Nevada Test Site. In that exercise, Delta Force teams were to recover
a stolen U.S. nuclear weapon from a Middle East terrorist group. Over
more than 20 years, what is now called the Joint Special Operations
Command has honed its ability to conduct surgical missions against
WMD production, storage and other facilities, using techniques and
weapons designed to minimize environmental damage and the danger of
dispersal.</TE>
<TE>   Putting new weapons together with these highly trained teams of
special operators, Pentagon planners have developed detailed
scenarios for dealing with any WMD facilities encountered in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Unmanned vehicles with special sensors keyed to detect radioactive
or chemical emissions would scout the site. HPMs would then be
employed. Spreading soundlessly along water pipes, air vents and
antennas, they would attack electronic equipment, causing the
facility to freeze up. HPMs might also be used to drive the enemy out
of bunkers and other secure sites without the destruction and
possible collateral damage that come with high explosives.</TE>
<TE>   Cluster and smart bombs could also bring about pinpoint
destruction of above-ground facilities. New incendiaries, combined
with penetrating munitions and chemicals, could burn up chemical or
biological agents. Under a program originally dubbed Vulcan Fire, the
Navy and Lockheed Martin are furiously working to field 20
inter-metallic incendiaries. Called HTI-J-1000, these penetrator
weapons combine high-temperature explosives to ignite and burn
chemical agents, with disinfectant chlorine and acids to neutralize
biological agents.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the boutique weapons and special operations remain highly
classified not only to preserve the element of surprise, but also
because -- politically -- they are highly controversial.</TE>
<TE>   This year's classified Nuclear Posture Review talked of a
classified weapon under development that uses "radiological
neutralization" of chemical/biological materials in production or
storage facilities. "Radiological neutralization" suggests something
awfully close to a nuclear weapon. And HPMs intended to destroy
military electronics and disrupt civilian electrical power systems
might also knock out electrical service to hospitals, for instance,
and attack backup generators. Even people with pacemakers might be
affected.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, high-tech antipersonnel devices must inflict pain while
avoiding burning, eye damage or other prolonged effects that could be
considered "unnecessary suffering," which is banned under existing
treaties and international law.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration justifies use of the new weapons on
grounds that hitting WMD sites with conventional weapons might create
large-scale disasters, because hazardous chemicals, toxins and
biological agents could be dispersed over a wide area.</TE>
<TE>   This line of thinking may stem in part from the fact that, during
the 1991 Gulf War, when Hussein had an enormous chemical and
biological arsenal, the United States took huge risks in attacking
WMD sites. American intelligence had no idea which targets actually
contained chemical and biological agents; only after the war did we
discover how little correlation there'd been between actual and
suspected WMD sites.</TE>
<TE>   Today, U.S. intelligence about the location of Hussein's illicit
materials is no better. The hope is that Iraq will do something to
"expose" its weapons, providing the opportunity for a clear American
shot. The goal -- reducing the risk of nuclear, chemical or
biological disaster -- is important.</TE>
<TE>   But good intentions may not be a good enough answer if units such
as Delta Force are sent into action with weapons and tactics that
appear to cross the threshold of what is considered lawful and
acceptable. Especially if the U.S. government does not begin to make
its case to the American public and the rest of the world until after
the fact.</TE>
<TE>   Secrecy seems to be the Bush administration's favorite operating
style. In the end, however, events may prove that its momentary
convenience comes at a heavy price.</TE>

<AU>Ellen Dannin</AU>
<BD>Ellen Dannin, a professor of law at Wayne State
University Law School, is author of "To Market, To Market:
Legislating on Privatization and Subcontracting."</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The federal government recently contracted out the job of creating a
new information system for the Civilian Personnel Management Service,
which is essentially the Pentagon's human resources department for
its civilian employees. The contractor immediately subcontracted out
part of the work to another firm. A treasure trove of information --
home addresses and phone numbers, spouses' names, children's names,
schools, Social Security numbers, e-mail addresses, information about
past employment and education, health records and disciplinary
actions -- was suddenly out of the government's sole control.</LD>
<LD>   Much of this information is highly marketable, and transferring it
to the contractor creates an opportunity, given the nature of data in
electronic form, to divert it for nefarious purposes. Identity theft
is one possibility. Blackmail to gain access and control over Defense
Department employees is another.</LD>
<LD>   The government, however, seems less interested in protecting this
valuable -- and potentially dangerous -- information than in
privatizing its services. The price may be our privacy and financial
security.</LD>
<TE>   Government collects and retains a wide range of sensitive
information about us, from HIV testing to brushes with the law.
Moreover, the Reason Public Policy Institute reports, more and more
private companies have government service contracts that enable them
to generate and collect highly personal information. This includes
social and mental health services; education, medication and
psychiatric services; unemployment benefits processing; accounting
and information technology; legal services; permit applications,
payment of taxes or fines and car registration. If any of this
information fell into the wrong hands, it could cause enormous
financial loss.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, federal and state governments see their information
systems as especially appropriate for privatization. According to the
Reason Institute, the Treasury Department has contracted out its
"information technology services, including networks, LANs [Local
Area Networks], desktop computer setups, help-desk support and system
administration." Pennsylvania has announced it will consolidate and
outsource all its agencies' data centers. Connecticut said it wants
to turn over all its information technology functions to the private
sector, because it doesn't view this as a core government function.</TE>
<TE>   Once information is either contracted out or subcontracted,
government loses control of it in many ways.</TE>
<TE>   For example, when a contractor provides computer equipment and
develops software to run it, personal information is embedded in the
software and may be impossible to extract when the contract expires
or is terminated. Equally worrisome, digital information, because it
is almost infinitely replicable, can be sold or retained by a
subcontractor for future use even after it has ostensibly been
returned to the government. How can the government, or we, be
satisfied that all copies have been returned?</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, most private contractors that have access to or store
confidential government information realize that security is a
priority.</TE>
<TE>   But just because most contractors can be trusted doesn't mean that
all can. Policy to protect our privacy cannot simply be based on the
competent and conscientious. Private companies already know this,
which is why many of them refused to disclose information about their
security vulnerabilities to the Office of Homeland Security. They
feared that the federal government would not have the same incentives
to protect the information's confidentiality.</TE>
<TE>   Compounding our vulnerability, federal and state governments are
increasingly unable to police their information technology contracts
for noncompliance. Key to such government oversight is the
development and retention of in-house expertise. But because IT is
often chosen for privatization, governments, in effect, divest
themselves of such expertise.</TE>
<TE>   Recent revelations of corporate impropriety teach an important
lesson about who can be trusted. A contractor in financial straits,
or one that puts profits above ethics, might find it difficult to
resist exploiting the valuable commodity that personal information
is. Take the unethical, even illegal lengths some companies will go
to, then couple that to mass identity theft, and you get a sense of
the potential problems.</TE>
<TE>   But the federal government hasn't learned these lessons. It plans
to continue privatizing huge numbers of government jobs intimately
connected to our national security. Government is not taking the
complex legal and technical issues raised by information transference
seriously. And there will be no solution if the answer is solely left
up to chance or market forces.</TE>
<TE>   Can it be that no one in Washington is concerned about protecting
this information? That the executive branch is prepared to risk our
privacy and hope for the best? That seems to be the case, and
Congress can't remain on the sidelines. For starters, it should hold
hearings on how to keep public information secure.</TE>
<TE>   There are two possible outcomes of such a debate. One is that
Congress would set clear standards for privatizing the government's
information. At a minimum, these standards should require that all
nongovernmental employees handling public information hold high-level
security clearances. Congress, furthermore, should appropriate money
to ensure that the government can exercise effective oversight of
contractors and devise severe penalties for violators.</TE>
<TE>   The second possibility is that Congress would conclude that public
information and IT functions should not be contracted out. Cost
savings might disappear if private contractors were held to the
highest security standards, making it cheaper for the government to
keep IT in-house. Even more important, Congress may see that no
matter how stiff the penalties are or how certain justice is, the
risk that our privacy may be violated to save the government some
money is simply not worth taking.</TE>

<HD>Test for Democrats</HD>
<DH>The party's near-monopoly power in Sacramento gives it a
unique chance to reverse its anti-business image</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Friedman</AU>
<BD>David Friedman, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a
senior fellow at the New America Foundation.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the last three years, California's economic reputation has
fallen from one of the best in the nation to the worst. Repelled by
what they consider anti-business policies and saddled with soaring
costs, defense, film and small and medium-sized companies in every
economic sector are moving or expanding elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   This isn't good news for Democrats, who control the Legislature
and occupy every statewide office. Worse, even if the stock-market
collapse and national slowdown caused part of the problem,
California's economic slide serves to reinforce the public perception
that Democrats are less friendly to business than Republicans.</LD>
<LD>   But there is opportunity in the party's monopoly on power. If
Democrats can reverse the state's economic course, the triumph will
be theirs alone and may go a long way toward changing the state's
reputation as the country's most notorious "job killer." With
California one of the few remaining Democratic strongholds, success
here can also boost the party's national reputation. Democrats can
begin this week when state leaders are scheduled to meet in an
emergency session to deal with the budget deficit.</LD>
<TE>   The first step should be to enact policies that will stimulate
private-sector investment and jobs. True, proposals that reduce
revenue at a time when the budget deficit is huge stand little chance
of passage. But they could be enacted now and phased in later when
the revenue shortfall is more manageable. The point for Democrats is
to send a message that California aims to be more business friendly.</TE>
<TE>   The state has, at best, a confusing mishmash of business
"incentives" that are either too complex or too limited in scope to
overcome the state's significant cost and other perceived
disadvantages. What's needed are unequivocal economic benefits for
companies that commit to stay and grow in the state. One example is a
recent proposal, pushed by the California Manufacturers and
Technology Assn., that would eliminate the state's 5% sales tax on
purchases of new manufacturing equipment.</TE>
<TE>   California manufacturing is suffering a truly epic contraction,
and the loss of hundreds of thousands of relatively high-paying
production jobs accounts for much of the state's chronic budget woes.
Personal income taxes account for the vast majority of state revenues
and are nearly 10 times the amount paid by corporations and banks.
Encouraging new-equipment purchases by waiving the sales tax on them
is predicted to generate about 50,000 new jobs a year and more than
offset any tax losses within five years, according to a study done by
the Milken Institute. Similar measures exchanging tax breaks for
significant long-term growth and investment should be offered as
broadly as possible throughout the state economy.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats in Sacramento should also reduce out-of-control
regulatory costs that profoundly disadvantage California companies in
national and worldwide competition. Politicians have dismissed most
of the complaints about the state's regulatory regime as so much
corporate grousing. But many of the gripes deserve serious attention.
In particular, California has to fix programs that are tainted by
crapshoot litigation and by virtually unbounded intervention by
bureaucratic and special-interest groups.</TE>
<TE>   A prime example is workers' compensation. Although the program was
modestly reformed during the 1990s' recession, state legislators
never corrected its most important flaw. Unlike almost every other
state, California does not compensate injured employees with
specified payments for each kind of work-related injury. Instead,
trial courts are allowed to set compensation. The result is all too
predictable. While employers elsewhere can more or less anticipate
workers' compensation and insurance costs, in California they tend to
view their employees as ticking, legal-liability time bombs waiting
to explode. Small wonder employers are reluctant to hire.</TE>
<TE>   Urban land development in California is another astonishingly
complex regulatory process. Many states have precisely defined
cleanup standards for previously developed property. Businesses know
exactly what they need to do to buy and clean up such land and
eventually open a factory, office park or store on it. But in
California, state regulators and a potentially unlimited range of
community, environmental or other interest groups can exploit the
state's regulatory process and insist on unique, if not draconian
requirements for a project. This dramatically increases the risks and
costs of urban development and drives countless jobs from the state.</TE>
<TE>   A third priority for Democrats is to allay widespread fears that
basic, everyday resources such as water and power are unreliable. In
part, this perception stems from the state's energy debacle, but
environmental restrictions, more limited Colorado River allocations
and economically weak utilities reinforce business anxieties about
the future of California's water and gas supplies.</TE>
<TE>   State Democrats can help alleviate these anxieties by adopting an
emergency water-supply program that would reallocate water from
low-valued agriculture to urban uses during critical droughts. This
would assure businesses and workers that, no matter what the weather
might bring, water will be available for the state's core economic
activities. Similarly, Democrats should resolve as quickly as
possible what appear to be legitimate claims of energy-market
manipulation and secure stable electricity and gas supplies at
reasonable prices. The message California urgently needs to send
global markets is: No business need fear that investments in the
state will suffer for lack of reasonably priced water, gas and
electric power.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, California's leadership, and its governing Democratic
majority in particular, should channel the state's progressive and
reformist political impulses in a more responsible manner. Much of
California's negative economic reputation arises from the dramatic
increase in the volume of anti-business legislation and regulation
proposed in Sacramento. Www.Jobkillers.org, for example, is a Web
site maintained by the California Chamber of Commerce and other
business groups. It chronicles pending and often singularly
ill-conceived legislative proposals.</TE>
<TE>   One way to reduce risks is to impose a significant measure of
economic discipline on the state's trigger-happy legislators by
subjecting any proposed bill or regulation to a detailed cost impact
and benefit assessment. Both the Clinton and the Bush administrations
imposed such requirements on the federal government, and they have
exposed particularly misguided legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Especially during tough times, California's lawmakers should not
be reluctant to analyze exactly what their proposals would
accomplish, and at what price, before saddling taxpayers with another
costly mandate. Cost-benefit assessments, for example, would almost
certainly show that efforts to improve automobile-fuel economy and
reduce exhaust emissions would generate significant net benefits for
California regardless of what auto manufacturers might claim. Such
policies would significantly cut air pollution and reduce what are
now excessive pressures on major statewide employers to achieve
otherwise unattainable air-quality goals.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, programs that would force cash-strapped
municipalities throughout the state to construct and operate
multibillion-dollar storm-water treatment facilities would almost
certainly fail any sensible cost-benefit analysis. Many are based on
poorly defined and scientifically moot water-quality standards.</TE>
<TE>   If California's majority Democrats act quickly to reward business
employment growth and investment, repair the state's worst regulatory
and resource problems, and focus on the most pressing, defensible
social and environmental goals, they can prove their party's economic
mettle just in time for the 2004 elections. But if they blindly do
nothing and allow the nation's largest state to suffer further
investment and job losses, they may soon find themselves in a fight
for their political survival.</TE>

<HD>The Right Should Let Up on Saudis</HD>

<AU>Jacob Heilbrunn</AU>
<BD>Jacob Heilbrunn is an editorial writer for the Los
Angeles Times.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>It's time to stop demonizing Saudi Arabia.</LD>
<LD>   Relations between Washington and Riyadh are dangerously
precarious, a state of affairs being blamed on Saudi "extremists."
But the real extremists are closer to home: prominent American
conservatives who are pressuring President Bush to abandon the
decades-old alliance, something he has sensibly resisted.</LD>
<LD>   It began after Sept. 11. "A successful U.S. effort to topple
Saddam and install a friendly regime in Baghdad," National Review
editor Rich Lowry observed early this year, could make "the
U.S.-Saudi relationship far less important."</LD>
<TE>   Then, in August, hawkish Defense Policy Board Chairman Richard
Perle's guest Laurent Murawiec, at the time an analyst at the Rand
Corp., declared at a Pentagon briefing before Henry Kissinger and
others that Saudi Arabia was "the kernel of evil" and that the United
States should be prepared to seize the oil fields of its "most
dangerous opponent." In the ensuing uproar, Murawiec left his job,
but his vision remains. Hawks like Frank Gaffney, president of the
Center for Security Policy and a former Reagan administration
Pentagon official, continue to condemn the "Saudi double-game."</TE>
<TE>   Ousting Saddam Hussein, so the thinking goes, would allow the U.S.
to emancipate itself from dependence on Saudi oil, and even allow us
to overthrow the repressive House of Saud militarily.</TE>
<TE>   Such visions of U.S. omnipotence in the Mideast are a mirage. The
U.S. and Saudi Arabia have far more to gain from cooperation than
confrontation. They face a common adversary in militant Islam. To
make Saudi Arabia an opponent would fulfill Osama bin Laden's dream
of a clash between Islam and the West.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, the portrait of Saudi Arabia as the spider at the
center of a web of funding for Terrorism Inc. is overdrawn. The
monarchy has been guilty of wishful thinking and criminal bungling,
but not calculated malevolence. In 1994, it froze Bin Laden's assets
but did not act forcefully to cut off private funds headed from Saudi
Arabia to his terror network. More recently, the claims that the wife
of Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Washington funded two of the 9/11
terrorists turned out to be overblown since the assistance was
intended for a Saudi woman who said she needed it for medical
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   A more sensible approach is outlined in a new report by Anthony H.
Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies: "A
clear distinction must ... be made," he notes, "between the
deliberate Saudi support of Islamic extremism and violence, and the
fact that many Saudis have contributed to what appeared to be Islamic
charities or gave money to what they felt were legitimate Islamic
causes -- such as the struggles in Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Kosovo --
without knowing the true character of the groups involved or where
the money ultimately went."</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, with the revelation that 15 of 19 hijackers were
Saudis, the Saudi government was initially defensive, but it has
since cracked down on support for extremists. It has increased its
intelligence work with the U.S., arrested several hundred terrorist
suspects and improved control over funds.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Riyadh dispatched officials from the Finance Ministry
and central bank to discuss with U.S. Treasury officials the most
effective ways to halt funding to Al Qaeda. The Saudi Arabian
Monetary Authority has exchanged information on money laundering with
foreign banking authorities. Saudi intelligence has also said that it
has identified 50 shell companies employed by Al Qaeda to transfer
funds. Adel al Jubeir, a senior foreign policy advisor to Crown
Prince Abdullah, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, has announced that
the government will heighten its vigilance. It is creating a
commission to audit charities to prevent money laundering and ban the
anonymous transfer of cash out of the kingdom.</TE>
<TE>   If Saudi Arabia is improving its cooperation in the financial
sphere, it has also supported the Bush administration's Iraq policy.
True, the kingdom has waffled on supporting an invasion of Iraq, but
it has now announced that the U.S. can use Prince Sultan Air Base as
a command center and takeoff point for jet fighters. And it has
steadily been upping oil production by more than 800,000 barrels a
day to maintain its own market share and to ensure that there is a
surplus so that prices do not skyrocket should a war take place. This
will have highly beneficial economic effects -- for the U.S. and the
world -- since oil shock could spark a severe recession.</TE>
<TE>   But for U.S. conservatives, the corruption of the Saudi monarchy
and the general debility of the Middle East are viewed as clear
indications than the entire region needs to be re-imagined. The road
to Baghdad is simply the first step. According to military scholar
Victor Davis Hanson in the Weekly Standard, the U.S. needs to destroy
the "entire apparatus of autocracy and [create] in its place the
conditions for future political legitimacy and economic growth in the
Middle East. Rather than fearing the uncertainty that this would
entail, we should understand that sometimes temporary chaos may be
better than enduring stasis."</TE>
<TE>   This is heady stuff. But chaos is not always temporary, as
conservatives -- of all people -- should know. It can lead to
catastrophe, as during the Iranian revolution. The wiser course is
for the U.S. to promote gradual change in Saudi Arabia -- especially
since its population is more conservative than the monarchy that
rules it. Lawmakers like Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) and
Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), who are pressuring the regime to stop all
private funding of terrorists but are not calling for regime change,
have it right. Conservatives spoiling for a fight with the Saudis
have no idea about who or what would replace the ruling family.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia is not a nefarious foe of the U.S. It is a despotic
regime that has clumsily reacted to the terrorist threat. But it is
also a vital strategic ally and supplier of oil riven by deep
internal divisions that the U.S. should not attempt to exacerbate.
Rather, the U.S. should prod it to reform.</TE>
<TE>   Trashing the Saudis may be emotionally satisfying, but it is
hardly the solution to stopping terrorism. Quite the contrary. If
Bush were to treat Saudi Arabia as a foe, it might easily become a
self-fulfilling prophecy.</TE>

<BD>Yitzhak Nakash teaches Middle East history at Brandeis
University. He is the author of "The Shi'is of Iraq."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Iraqi opposition groups will meet this week in London to discuss the
principles that would govern Iraq in the event the Bush
administration decides to take action against Saddam Hussein. How
power would be distributed among the various sectarian and ethnic
groups in a new Iraq will be the point of most contention.</LD>
<LD>   Since the British creation of Iraq in 1921, a Sunni Arab minority,
constituting barely 20% of the population and based in central Iraq,
has wielded power over the Shiite Arab majority of 55% to 60% spread
over southern and central Iraq and over a Kurdish minority of some
20% in the north. The three groups have had conflicting aspirations,
but they share a vital interest in keeping Iraq intact.</LD>
<LD>   For the Sunni minority, Iraq's continued existence as currently
configured is a matter of survival. The Sunnis know that
fragmentation would end their political hegemony and prosperity,
leaving them in control of a small territory in central Iraq with
access neither to the sea nor to the oil fields of the north and
south.</LD>
<TE>   As for the Shiites in the south, if the country splintered they
would lose the capital, Baghdad (despite the fact that Shiites are
half its population), and the shrine cities of Kazimiyah and Samarra
in central Iraq, as well as substantial revenues from the oil wells
in the north.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Sunni and Shiite Arabs, the Kurds constitute a distinct
ethnic group. For them, Iraq's integrity is a matter of realpolitik.
The Kurds understand that no Iraqi government could survive the
outcry within Iraq that creation of an independent Kurdistan in
northern Iraq would cause. The Kurds also know that Turkey, Iran and
Syria would not tolerate an independent Kurdish state for fear that
it would encourage their own restive Kurdish minorities to push for
cultural and political rights.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of opposition voices inside Iraq, the task of
speaking for Iraqis has been left to opposition groups in exile.
Other than the Kurdistan Democratic Party, led by Massoud Barzani,
and the Popular Union of Kurdistan, led by Jalal Talabani, both of
which operate within Iraqi Kurdistan, the four other major groups are
the Iraqi National Congress, led by Ahmad Chalabi; the Supreme
Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, led by Ayatollah Muhammed
Bakr Hakim; the Constitutional Monarchy Movement, led by Sharif Ali
bin Hussein; and the Iraqi National Accord, led by Iyad Allawi.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi National Congress is mostly Shiite and includes both
secular and devout Muslims. The Supreme Council is Shiite Islamist
while the monarchist group is Sunni. The mostly Sunni Iraqi National
Accord, representing ex-military officers, includes a few Shiites.
All these groups are committed to the territorial integrity of Iraq,
and their members could play a role in rebuilding Iraq after the fall
of Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, the United States would need to assure all Iraqis
that it is not like the first Bush administration, which ultimately
was not committed to regime change during the Gulf War. The current
Bush administration must also express its resolve to stand by Iraqis
following the collapse of the Baath Party regime. An attempt to
replace Hussein with a "nice" Sunni general amenable to U.S.
interests, and to those of the neighboring countries, would backfire
because Shiites would oppose a state in which they were again
assigned a marginal political role. Instead, the U.S. and the
international community would need to guarantee the emergence of a
federal republic in Iraq in which the Shiites can gain access to
power and the Kurds can continue to enjoy a degree of self-rule.</TE>
<TE>   By virtue of being the majority, the Shiites are likely to play
the leading political role in a new Iraq. Yet they would need to set
aside their grievances over historical mistreatment by the ruling
Sunni minority and assure the Sunnis that a change of regime would
not expose them to Shiite revenge and tyranny. Iraq's Sunnis might
not be easily persuaded to relinquish their political hegemony, and
so, to allay their fears, a power-sharing formula must be developed
by Iraqis soon after the U.S. liberation of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In the longer run, Iraq's Shiites will need to develop a political
leadership that can unite observant Shiites and secularists, rural
and urban dwellers, Shiites living inside Iraq as well as those in
exile. The Islamists among them will need to reconcile Western ideas
of democracy with Islamic concepts of freedom and justice.
Accomplishing these tasks might enable a Shiite to emerge as a
national leader recognized by the majority of Iraqis.</TE>
<TE>   Arab Shiites and Sunnis are meshed, as evident from the large
number of mixed marriages in Iraq. The two groups share social codes
and cultural attributes that could form the basis of an Iraqi
nationalism drawing on the ideas of the literary figure Ali Sharqi,
who died in 1964. Sharqi offered a vision of Iraq that built on the
strong Arab tribal character of its people. He advocated the
development of a nationalist ideology that combined Arab and other
Eastern elements with Iraqi values and heritage. Sharqi argued that
only an authentic Iraqi nationalism that drew on Iraq's Babylonian
past and the tribal customs and traditions governing Iraqi society
would yield a government that served its people. His ideas could be
further developed in the course of rebuilding Iraq after the collapse
of Hussein's regime.</TE>
<TE>   As the largest ethnic group, Arabs (both Shiites and Sunnis) would
need to offer the Kurds a pact recognizing their culture and
safeguarding their rights within a reunified Iraq. The 1970 accord
between Hussein and Kurdish leader Mustafa Barzani has been referred
to over the years by Iraqi Arabs and Kurds as a basis for settling
the Kurdish problem in Iraq. The accord acknowledged the distinct
national identity of the Kurds. It permitted the Kurds to develop
special educational and cultural programs, and it recognized Kurdish,
alongside Arabic, as an official language in areas where Kurds formed
a majority. The accord also promised the Kurds participation in the
Iraqi government and predominance in the local administration.</TE>
<TE>   In return for a similar offer backed by the U.S. and the United
Nations following the war, the Kurds would have to forge new links
with the Iraqi state and demonstrate a commitment to sharing power in
an Iraqi state.</TE>
<TE>   In a new Iraq, power should not be monopolized by Baghdad but
shared among the central, southern and northern parts of the country.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Baghdad would probably remain the locus of Iraqi
national politics. Iraq's foreign and defense policy, and its
economic budget and oil fields, should be controlled by the federal
government in Baghdad. A good part of the proceeds from oil, however,
should be reinvested in the north and south where oil is found.</TE>
<TE>   The United States would need to encourage Iraqis to develop a
strong parliamentary system composed of regional assemblies and a
national parliament in Baghdad. The latter should serve as a major
arena for public debate and should be capable of checking the
executive's decisions. Seats should be distributed among Iraq's
various social and ethnic groups (including Turkomans, Assyrians and
Chaldeans) in proportion with their size.</TE>
<TE>   The composition of the federal government, like that of the
national parliament, should reflect the social fabric of Iraqi
society and the majority status of Shiites. To maintain the
credibility of the new government, ministerial posts should be filled
by Iraqis who are respected within the country.</TE>
<TE>   Until Iraqis are ready to elect their national leader, it might be
necessary for rule to be shared by a triumvirate consisting of, say,
a Shiite president, a Sunni prime minister and a Kurdish speaker of
parliament. It would be up to Iraqis to agree on these individuals.
Their roles should be clearly defined by the constitution and
endorsed by the national parliament.</TE>
<TE>   To ensure Iraq's stability, the United States would need to
pressure Turkey, Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia not to interfere in
Iraqi affairs, allowing Iraqis to develop their own vision of a new
Iraq. That task has already begun by Iraqis in exile, and it ought to
be concluded together with their compatriots inside the country after
the liberation of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of the Shiites coming to power should not raise the
fear that Iraq might be swept away by Islamic radicalism, or that
Iran would be able to increase its leverage in the country to a
significant extent.</TE>
<TE>   On the contrary, for more than a decade radical Islam in the
Middle East has been largely shaped by Sunnis, many of whom have been
influenced by the Wahhabi-Hanbali school dominant in Saudi Arabia.
Although the Iranian revolution emboldened Arab Shiites, Iran has
failed to reshape Arab Shiism in its own image.</TE>
<TE>   The task of rebuilding Iraq will be a challenging one, but it
might prove easier to accomplish than it has been in Afghanistan
because Iraq has rich oil reserves, a strong agricultural sector, a
tradition of market-oriented economy and a large secular bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   Down the road, there could be a backlash against the wish of the
majority to bring decency and tolerance to Iraqi sociopolitical life.
It would be the responsibility of the United States to assure Iraqis
that their desire for an Iraq that serves its people and does not
threaten its neighbors will prevail.</TE>

<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>On the wall of a squatters' cafe in the Indonesian capital hangs an
oil painting of Osama bin Laden. But this is no haven for
fundamentalist Islam.</LD>
<LD>   Street musicians have squatted in the buildings of the
government's youth center in Bulungan, South Jakarta, for about 17
years. They have the tacit blessing of local authorities because they
help keep the area clean and safe. The cafe I'm visiting is newly
opened and features live music but no alcohol. Electric guitars
scream and singers belt out the lyrics of reggae, rap and rock 'n'
roll.</LD>
<LD>   I have come to the cafe during Ramadan, a month of fasting and
prayer for Indonesia's 200 million Muslims and a time when
fundamentalist interpretations of the Koran come into conflict with
the way many Indonesian Muslims live. In Jakarta, a curfew on
nightlife has been imposed for Ramadan. Clubs and bars must shut by 1
a.m. To enforce the curfew, stave- and sword-wielding vigilantes in
robes and turbans patrol the city on motorcycles.</LD>
<TE>   On this night, at 1 a.m., the musicians are at the peak of their
performance when the music is interrupted by whistles, sirens,
shouting and the thundering of hundreds of motorbikes. The
fundamentalist vigilantes have arrived to close the club.</TE>
<TE>   They are thugs, used to bullying prostitutes and frightening club
owners. But the squatters aren't easily intimidated. The street
musicians crank up their sound systems and shout back. From the cafe
stage, a man with a theatrical voice wails a lunatic laugh into the
microphone: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!" he booms, over and over.</TE>
<TE>   The vigilantes seem baffled. They continue shouting, but with less
heart. Eventually they move out, revving their engines and roaring
away into the night in search of meeker victims. The cafe skirmish
ends quickly, but the larger war between fundamentalism and a more
moderate Islam rages on in Indonesia. Thugs, terrorists and Islamist
clerics aggressively -- and sometimes violently -- push their views.
Indonesian authorities are intent on capturing Al Qaeda operatives
and other fundamentalist terrorists, but they also know they must
tread carefully.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Bakar Bashir, a cleric believed to be the spiritual leader of
the shadowy Southeast Asian terrorist organization Jemaah Islamiah,
is being held by police, who have accused him of involvement in bomb
attacks and a plot to assassinate President Megawati Sukarnoputri.
But even in jail, he is allowed to write a column for a Jakarta
newspaper. In a recent article, he argued that the proof of faith is
upholding Islamic law. He urges his readers to follow the path of the
prophet Abraham, who, according to the Koran, blindly followed God's
order to sacrifice his son, Ishmael.</TE>
<TE>   When the Indonesian police brought Imam Samudra -- the most
important terrorist yet arrested in connection with October's Bali
nightclub bombings -- to Jakarta for interrogation, he managed to get
a few words to the news media: "Patience. Patience. God willing, this
is not a dishonorable struggle. It is a holy quest." Police have
linked Samudra to a series of other terrorist attacks and an armed
robbery of a jeweler's shop. Samudra told his interrogators that
taking the wealth of unbelievers is lawful in Islam. As for the
Muslims killed in the nightclub blasts, he said: "It was their own
fault to be in a sinful environment. But, God willing, [they] will
enter paradise."</TE>
<TE>   Another alleged terrorist had a poem to his wife published by a
Jakarta daily. "Don't be sad that I have to leave you," he wrote.
"One day you will be proud to have known me." It is obvious that the
terror suspects know how to play the media and paint themselves as
humane fighters for "real Islam."</TE>
<TE>   They refer to scripture with such certainty that many doubt their
guilt. After all, a true jihad is a holy war every Muslim must fight.
Whenever the war against terrorism is presented as the United States'
war against Islam, the terrorists' views become more widely accepted.
There might be only a small core of hardened fanatics who resort to
large-scale killing, but there are thousands and thousands of "petty
terrorists" who enjoy intimidating and collecting protection money
from "sinful businesses."</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the untold numbers more who, like those here at the
squatters' cafe, aren't terrorists or even fundamentalists but admire
Bin Laden for what they see as his standing up to U.S. imperialism.
They don't support his religious views or his role in Sept. 11, but
they are deeply concerned about U.S. motives in the world,
particularly toward Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   A small number of Muslim intellectuals here do speak out against
fundamentalism, namely the loose group around Nurcholis Madjid, known
as the propagandists for "Liberal Islam." But they are an elite few.
If the U.S. wants to make a difference in Indonesia -- and perhaps
get those Bin Laden posters off the walls of Jakarta -- it must
provide support for moderate ulamas, respected religious scholars who
often give advice to Muslim leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Both moderate and fundamentalist ulamas often run Islamic boarding
schools, so the U.S. could help in funding and scholarship
opportunities for the more moderate schools. Currently the U.S. is
broadcasting on Indonesian television advertisements posing as
mini-documentaries about happy Muslims living in the U.S., but the
thinly veiled propaganda is unconvincing. The U.S. is still widely
seen as having an anti-Islam, imperialist agenda.</TE>
<TE>   The confrontation with the motorbike gang demonstrates another way
to fight fundamentalism. As Otig Pakis, an actor and performance
artist at the cafe tells me with a grin: "You've got to be crazy when
you face the fundamentalists. Crazy people do not have to follow
Islamic law."</TE>

<AU>James H. Smalhout</AU>
<BD>James H. Smalhout is a financial writer and author of
"The Uncertain Retirement."</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Congress has spent the last year debating 401(k) reform in response
to the Enron disaster. But the honorable members should stop gazing
into the rearview mirror. Today's private pension plans were designed
for another era. Employer-sponsored pensions worked much better in
yesterday's industrial economy with its more permanent workforce.</LD>
<LD>   Workers, on average, now change jobs nearly 10 times by the age of
36, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. A vastly
different approach is needed.</LD>
<LD>   But never mind the big picture. It's much easier for politicians
to fiddle with a few details. Will they cap the amount of employer
stock that can go into 401(k)s at, perhaps, 20%, as many Democrats
prefer? That still would leave retirement savers vulnerable to
business debacles.</LD>
<TE>   Most Republicans want to give workers the choice to sell company
shares after holding them for, say, three years. But that's not so
reassuring either, as long as what passes for corporate accounting
leaves investors and employees in a fog about true financial
performance.</TE>
<TE>   Those in the nostalgia crowd, for their part, have been dismissing
the entire 401(k) movement as a mistake. And they're getting
traction, after two years of stock market declines and the trauma of
corporate scandals. They want to replace 401(k)s, a concept that
dates from the 1970s, with an earlier idea: the defined-benefit
pension that caught on in a big way during the 1940s and 1950s. These
plans make monthly retirement payments based on previous earnings and
length of service to a single employer.</TE>
<TE>   Quite a few traditional defined-benefit plans are still around,
but they stand no chance of meeting the needs of most people in
today's -- much less tomorrow's -- labor force. The pensions are
"back-loaded," meaning they don't begin to grow by much until workers
have spent many years at the same company. At least the money in
401(k)s is portable.</TE>
<TE>   As many as one-third of all workers have become "free agents": the
self-employed, independent contractors, small-business owners,
temporary employees, professionals in solo practices. Today's
pensions serve these people poorly. And half of all working Americans
have no pension coverage at all.</TE>
<TE>   Some longtime proponents of traditional defined-benefit plans are
starting to look for a better way. "The question in the post-Enron
era," says Michael S. Gordon, a Washington attorney who helped draft
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, "is whether
employer-based private pensions have become so untrustworthy and
inefficient that they should be replaced by something less
problematic."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Treasury will give up $126 billion in revenues this year
in order to encourage retirement saving through employer-sponsored
plans. That's the largest "tax expenditure" after the
mortgage-interest deduction. But companies have been extremely clever
about using this subsidy for things that have nothing to do with
preparing for old age.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses, for example, constantly use "surplus" money from
traditional defined-benefit plans to pad their bottom lines. Assumed
investment returns boosted the reported operating earnings of S&amp;P 500
companies last year by an unprecedented extent, according to a study
released by the investment firm Morgan Stanley. But the reality was
not nearly as rosy because actual returns failed to match the
assumptions.</TE>
<TE>   This is just part of the enormous problem with corporate
accounting. Almost $300 billion in pension surpluses, meanwhile, has
vanished since 1999 as a result of poor stock market returns and
changes in the terms of the plans.</TE>
<TE>   The 401(k) abuses flow from the same conundrum. Enron's 401(k)
fiasco never would have happened if Congress had not created an
impossible conflict when it passed the retirement income security
act. The act pushed corporate executives into unlikely roles as plan
"fiduciaries," legally obligating them to protect the interests of
plan participants.</TE>
<TE>   The law, in other words, put foxes in charge of the chicken coop.
What businessman worth his salt would turn thumbs down on the chance
to make money for his company in order to shield workers from losses
in their retirement plans?</TE>
<TE>   Companies, not surprisingly, have gone out of their way to issue
stock to their 401(k) plans in order to keep the companies in
friendly hands. And plan participants have sued a long list of
companies, in addition to Enron, alleging breach of fiduciary duty in
connection with investments in employer stock. Rite Aid, Lucent
Technologies, Nortel Networks, Qwest, Williams Cos., Providian
Financial Corp., Ikon Office Solutions, WorldCom and Xerox have been
among them.</TE>
<TE>   America needs a new generation of employment-based, not
employer-based, retirement saving vehicles. Call them "Triple-A
pensions," ideal for workers on the move.</TE>
<TE>   The American Automobile Assn., Kaiser Permanente, Blue Cross/Blue
Shield and other large, independent insurance carriers all could make
excellent sponsors. Congress should give the new Triple-A plans, with
independent third parties behind the wheel, the same valuable tax
treatment enjoyed by traditional defined-benefit plans and 401(k)s.</TE>
<TE>   Employers should welcome the new plans. Group contracts, no doubt,
would cut costs. And employer contributions would make them a breed
apart from today's IRAs.</TE>
<TE>   But the ultimate beneficiaries would be retirement savers, and
they have needs that aren't being met with current pension plans.
Many would be better off in a defined-benefit plan, but without
back-loading. Such a thing, unfortunately, doesn't exist in today's
marketplace. Workers should have better choices at four stages:</TE>
<TE>   * they should be able to choose a Triple-A plan or to stick with
the old way;</TE>
<TE>   * savers, once in a Triple-A plan, should decide whether and to
what extent they want to take a defined-benefit approach;</TE>
<TE>   * Triple-A plans should offer a menu of cost-effective investment
choices, unlike most 401(k)s and IRAs today;</TE>
<TE>   * annuity choices should be attractive. Only TIAA-CREF, the
401(k)-type system for many college professors, private school
employees and others, seems to have made a serious effort to provide
retirement payments that protect retirees against inflation and other
risks of living longer than expected. Not surprisingly, the market
for individual retirement annuities today is minuscule.</TE>
<TE>   This may be a propitious time to introduce Triple-A pensions.
Companies that, until recently, used traditional defined-benefit
plans to puff up their bottom lines will be paying for this
legerdemain for years to come. Many will be sorely tempted to switch
to 401(k)s. Workers, however, will be leery. That's one more reason
why Triple-A pensions could be the best way forward. But it won't
happen until Congress stops staring into the rearview mirror and
takes a sober look down the road ahead.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After a court in Iran sentenced dissident academic Hashem Aghajari to
death for challenging clerical rule, several thousand university
students took to the streets in Tehran. They protested for about two
weeks before the government threatened to crack down and declare a
state of emergency. No one has forgotten the government's hard-line
response, in July 1999, to crowds rallying against the closure of a
liberal newspaper. Most of the student protesters rounded up then
remain in jail.</LD>
<LD>   It is only a matter of time before growing demographic rifts in
Iranian society trigger more tremors. The struggle for reform in Iran
is increasingly a fight between fathers and sons. Roughly a majority
of Iran's 65 million people is under the age of 30. From the devout
to the secular, students at the Sharif Technical University, where
the largest protest occurred, are some of the brightest in the
country. But with unemployment pushing 22%, those about to graduate
face a bleak job market.</LD>
<LD>   Many students complain that the 1979 Islamic revolution hasn't
benefited them as much as it did their predecessors. Others chafe at
the fact that some of their religious professors sit in jail for
having made the "wrong" interpretation of Islamic law. Still others
resent prohibitions against dancing and singing in public. All share
a common desire for greater freedom of expression.</LD>
<TE>   Reformers draw their strongest support from this younger crowd,
especially among those born after the revolution. The politics of
this generation gap were highlighted when Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's grandson joined the student protesters on the streets. And
Mohammad Bagher Zolghader, a general in the Revolutionary Guards,
recently urged soldiers returning home from duty not to be swayed by
their children's views.</TE>
<TE>   Aghajari's sin was to call for a "religious renewal" of Shiite
Islam in a June speech commemorating the death of Ali Shariati, an
important but suppressed thinker behind the revolution. The speech
drew from Shariati's teachings -- specifically, his contention that
Shiite clerics have no monopoly on the interpretation of Islamic law.
Conservative clerics in the regime immediately called for Aghajari's
head.</TE>
<TE>   For Aghajari and other reformers in Iran, the fight for expanded
free speech and democratic institutions is as much political as it is
theological. In challenging the orthodoxy that the faithful must
blindly follow doctrine as if they were "monkeys," Aghajari pushed
the envelope at a tense time for the nation's clerics. Several months
ago, Ayatollah Jalaluddin Taheri, a long-venerated and senior prayer
leader in Isfahan, published a scathing open letter calling them
"louts and fascists" who had betrayed the principles of the
revolution. He remains under house arrest.</TE>
<TE>   The student turnout may have given Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami a new, if perhaps short, lease on political life. During past
political crises in Iran, popular discontent has served to bolster
Khatami, the icon of the reform movement. But some of the students'
slogans suggested budding distrust in Khatami's ability to deliver on
the campaign promises that swept him into office in 1997 with 80% of
the vote. When one student speaker at a rally remarked that the
president "only smiles beautifully and speaks nice words," there were
raucous cheers from the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   But Khatami may be ready to throw down the gauntlet. Taking aim at
the two main bastions of conservative sentiment, he is pressing
legislation that would limit the discretionary powers of the
judiciary and the Council of Guardians. The judiciary has imprisoned
dozens of reformers, including some of his inner circle. The
unelected guardians are no less an obstacle to reform because the
council vets most candidates for election and all legislation coming
from parliament. Khatami has threatened to quit, and take most of the
parliament with him, if his conservative foes bottle up his
legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has done little to encourage democracy in
Iran. Hopes for improved relations -- opinion polls released in
September showed that 74% of the Iranian respondents favored dialogue
with the United States -- have been largely dashed by the U.S. The
administration blocked Iran's application to the World Trade
Organization, limited exports of food and medicine to Iran and
tightened restrictions on assistance to refugees. Then it included
Iran in its "axis of evil," which has further enabled conservative
clerics to pose as defenders of the republic.</TE>
<TE>   The mullahs have successfully exploited the country's sense of
foreboding of being surrounded by the United States. A U.S. invasion
of Iraq, they contend, would put American soldiers in Afghanistan, in
Central Asia, in some Gulf states and in Baghdad. The only
appropriate response to such encirclement, the conservative clerics
say, is unity, not unrest. To top it off, the administration has put
reformers in an extremely awkward position by asking the Iranian
government for help in U.S. efforts to invade Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The reformers have vowed to keep up their fight, and Aghajari will
not be an easy opponent for the ruling mullahs. A dynamic public
speaker, he is a decorated veteran who lost a brother and a leg in
the Iran-Iraq conflict of 1980-88. Aghajari had refused to appeal the
death sentence even though Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme
leader, ordered the judiciary to reconsider the verdict. Last week,
Aghajari's attorney filed the appeal. Student leaders recently
released from jail have pledged to conduct campus referendums on the
legitimacy of the conservative clerics.</TE>
<TE>   If a second Iranian revolution is brewing, it has a way to go
before boiling over. Still, the same people who, two decades ago, led
the protests that brought down the shah know well the political
potential of students on the streets. The reform movement, taken to
its logical conclusion, will produce regime change from within and
democratically. That is the type of democratization in the Middle
East that the U.S. should do everything in its power to support.</TE>

neighborhoods, this bedroom community has become a refuge for
homeowners priced out of San Diego and Orange counties. Among the top
10 fastest growing cities in California last year, Murrieta has more
than 65,000 residents.</LD>
<TE>   Historic sheep spa</TE>
<TE>   The city is named after Spaniard Don Juan Murrieta, who bought a
52,000-acre ranch in 1873 and herded 100,000 sheep on the valley's
rich grasses. The city's official history notes that the area's
natural hot springs "proved a cleansing sheep dip." Murrieta remained
a tiny community until a population boom in the late 1980s spurred
local leaders to push for cityhood. It incorporated in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing card</TE>
<TE>   Relatively affordable new housing draws commuters who work in
adjoining counties. The average current list price for a 1,800- to
2,000-square-foot home in Murrieta is $281,500. By comparison, homes
that size in Orange County's Mission Viejo list for between $353,000
and $575,000, according to agent Bo Sandulescu of Tarbell Realtors in
Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   Wow factor</TE>
<TE>   The 8,300-acre Santa Rosa Plateau Ecological Reserve is a glorious
expanse of oak woodlands, vernal pools, bunchgrass prairie and
chaparral in the hills to the west of Murrieta.</TE>
<TE>   Insider's view</TE>
<TE>   Murrieta has well-kept parks and playgrounds, but few restaurants.
Most residents drive 15 minutes to neighboring Temecula for retail
shopping and dining, and singles lament the lack of night life.</TE>
<TE>   Hot spots</TE>
<TE>   The city's high-end communities include La Cresta, on the Santa
Rosa Plateau, where parcels are a minimum of 5 acres. Homes start at
$500,000 for an older, 2,500-square-foot home without horse
facilities and can run more than $2.5 million for newer equestrian
estates.</TE>
<TE>   Bear Creek Golf and Country Club is a community of 600 homes,
ranging from $300,000 for two-bedroom condos to as much as $1.5
million for high-end custom homes on the golf course designed by Jack
Nicklaus. "The value is incredible, what you can get for your money,"
Bear Creek Realty broker Lisa Clark said. "For a million here, you're
looking at $3 million to $4 million someplace else."</TE>
<TE>   Good news, bad news</TE>
<TE>   Unless you find work in the Temecula Valley, commutes average an
hour each way to San Diego and as long or longer to Orange County.
But in a recent survey commissioned by the I-15 Interregional
Partnership, a two-county effort to reduce congestion on Interstate
15 between San Diego and Riverside counties, most commuters said that
housing affordability, low crime rates and the look of the community
made the drive worthwhile.</TE>
<TE>   On the market</TE>
<TE>   As of Dec. 2, there were 322 homes on the market, ranging in price
from $210,000 to $1.9 million, according to Michael Horan of Tarbell
Realtors of Murrieta.</TE>
<TE>   Stock report</TE>
<TE>   Murrieta has about 17,000 single-family homes, 3,354 apartments
and nearly 600 condominiums and attached homes.</TE>

<LD>Sam Goldwyn, the cantankerous and independent producer of such
Oscar-winning films as "The Best Years of Our Lives" (1946) and such
big-budget movie-musicals as "Guys and Dolls" (1955) and "Porgy and
Bess" (1959), owned this house in the late '20s, after he married
actress Frances Howard.</LD>
<LD>   Goldwyn often played cards with Clark Gable in the pool house
cabana while a young Judy Garland played poolside. Errol Flynn stayed
late enough to be put up in a guest room near an upstairs hideaway
where Goldwyn read scripts.</LD>
<LD>   The home was host to nearly every major Hollywood player in the
Golden Age of Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   About this house: Judson Rothschild, a real estate developer and
longtime Beverly Hills resident, and Timothy Hart, a former
advertising executive, bought this neo-classic 1916 house to save it.
They outbid another developer who planned to demolish the house. They
restored it and added modern amenities, particularly in the kitchen
and bathrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $6.9 million</TE>
<TE>   Size: The house has six bedrooms and 5.5 bathrooms in about 6,500
square feet. The lot size is 32,129 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Features: The gated estate has expansive lawns, a pool, a pool
pavilion, a motor court, a cabana with a fireplace and pathways under
trellises. There is a large foyer with a floating staircase and a
fresco on the dining room ceiling. The home also has a screening
room, breakfast room, six-room master suite, laundry room and
three-car garage. The main house has three fireplaces. The guest
house has a kitchen.</TE>

<AU>Ruth Ryon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Talk-show host Ricki Lake and her husband, freelance illustrator Rob
Sussman, have purchased the Brentwood home of actress Courteney Cox
and her husband, actor David Arquette, for close to its $6.5-million
asking price.</LD>
<LD>   Lake and Sussman will continue to be based in New York but may
eventually spend more time in their California home.</LD>
<LD>   The five-bedroom, 5,200-square-foot house, on nearly an acre with
a pool and rolling lawns behind gates, was renovated by Cox, who has
a passion for redoing houses when she isn't working on the TV series
"Friends" or co-starring in such movies as "3,000 Miles to Graceland"
(2001).</LD>
<TE>   The home has a great room with soaring ceilings and large
skylights, a master suite with a fireplace and a sitting area, and a
detached guest suite and gym. There is also an outdoor living room.</TE>
<TE>   The house was built in 1949. Cox refurbished it after buying it
for close to $2.1 million in 1996. She and her husband, who co-stars
in the recently released movie "The Grey Zone" with Harvey Keitel and
Mira Sorvino, live at the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Lake, 34, is in her 10th season hosting the talk show that
bears her name. She is also supervising producer of the show, which
underwent a make-over last summer and is now in syndication. Lake
also has played the recurring role of Stephanie, the younger sister
of Kevin James' title character, on the CBS sitcom "The King of
Queens," and she starred in the movie "Mrs. Winterbourne" (1996). In
September, she alternated as Fanny Brice in a benefit performance of
"Funny Girl" at the New Amsterdam Theater in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Sussman's political illustrations were published in the New York
Times and Village Voice as early as 1994, the year he and Lake were
married. He works as a cartoonist as well as a graphic artist.</TE>
<TE>   Jonah Wilson at Prudential California, John Aaroe Division in
Beverly Hills, had the listing on the home Lake and Sussman
purchased, and Brett Lawyer of the same office represented the
buyers, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Trying Beverly Hills on for size</TE>
<TE>   Phil McGraw, host of the CBS talk show "Dr. Phil," and his wife,
Robin, are leasing a Beverly Hills-area home for a year at $20,000 a
month.</TE>
<TE>   The couple, who previously lived in Texas, moved into their
Westside quarters a few months ago. Described as "an elegant, gated
mini-estate," the home has six bedrooms and eight bathrooms in
slightly more than 7,000 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   The French-style house, built in 1987, has marble, hardwood and
slate floors, a library, a kitchen with granite counters, a master
suite with a sitting area, a guest house, pool, spa and gardens.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Phil" was launched in September as a syndicated talk show.
Before that, the Dallas psychologist, 52, penned best-selling
self-help books and appeared weekly for a few years on "The Oprah
Winfrey Show."</TE>
<TE>   Winfrey became his mentor after he coached her through a lawsuit
and trial with the Texas cattle industry. A cattle breeders'
association had filed a libel suit against Winfrey over remarks made
about beef. Winfrey credited McGraw, co-founder of the Texas-based
legal consulting firm Courtroom Sciences Inc., with helping her to
triumph in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Vicki Driscoll of Coldwell Banker's Montana office in Santa Monica
represented the lessees, and H. Blair Chang of Coldwell Banker,
Beverly Hills, had the listing, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian takes root in Los Feliz</TE>
<TE>   Yanic Truesdale, who plays the snooty Paris transplant Michel
Gerard on the WB's "Gilmore Girls," has bought a Los Feliz home for
$610,000. It is the Montreal-born actor's first home purchase in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   The 1927 Spanish-style house has three bedrooms, an office and 2
1/2 bathrooms in about 1,800 square feet. The home also has a large
living room with city views, a formal dining room, coved ceilings,
arches, hardwood floors and a grassy backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Truesdale, 31, came to Los Angeles in 1999 after starring in
several high-profile Canadian TV series, including "Roommates."
During that series, he was nominated for a Gemini Award, Canada's
version of the Emmy.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Weissman of DBL Realtors, Sunset, represented Truesdale,
and Patricia Ruben of DBL, Los Feliz, had the listing, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   He's got an Emmy and a bigger house</TE>
<TE>   Larry Wilmore, who won an Emmy Award this year as writer of Fox's
"The Bernie Mac Show," and his wife, actress Leilani Jones Wilmore,
have sold their Pasadena home for $1.2 million and purchased a San
Marino house for just under $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The home they sold has five bedrooms in close to 4,000 square
feet. The house, built in 1988, has a living room with a cathedral
ceiling, a master suite with a balcony and a maid's or guest room
with its own entrance.</TE>
<TE>   The house they bought has five bedrooms in 5,200 square feet. The
1949 Colonial was remodeled in 2000 and has a game room, three
fireplaces, a pool/spa, pool house, grassy yard, fire pit and
four-car garage. The gated estate is near the Huntington Library, Art
Collections and Botanical Gardens.</TE>
<TE>   Wilmore also has been a writer on such series as "In Living Color"
and "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," and he was executive producer of
"The PJs" (1999). His wife is a stage actress, and she has done voice
work on such movies as "Escape From Monkey Island" (2000). She also
has appeared on such TV series as "Almost Perfect" (1996) and
"Sister, Sister" (1994).</TE>
<TE>   Boyd Smith and Maggie Navarro of Coldwell Banker, Old Pasadena,
represented the buyers of the Pasadena home, which had been listed by
Cynthia Salcido and Laurie Jutzi of DBL Realtors. Joyce Kristensson
of Century 21 Golden Realty represented the Wilmores in buying, and
Carol Chua-Vigue of Coldwell Banker had the San Marino listing,
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   A chance at late virtuoso's home</TE>
<TE>   The former Malibu home of Liberace has come on the market at about
$1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Liberace used the property in the 1970s as a getaway. The late
entertainer combined two condos to make one with three bedrooms and 2
3/4 bathrooms in slightly more than 1,800 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   The expanded condo, which Liberace also decorated, is in a
building with four other units on a sandy beach.</TE>
<TE>   The unit comes with such Liberace memorabilia as a decorative mini
baby grand that the pianist signed, a small lamp that looks like a
candle and a bar in the shape of a piano.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Rubenstein at Coldwell Banker, Malibu West, has the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Animator makes a lofty purchase</TE>
<TE>   Rocky Morton, a British animation and computer graphics designer
turned Hollywood feature director and producer, has purchased a
Venice loft for about its $1.9-million asking price.</TE>
<TE>   Morton, co-creator with Annabel Jankel of the 1980s video icon Max
Headroom, bought a newly built loft linked architecturally with two
others. The three-level, 3,500-square-foot lofts were designed by
Mark Mack and developed by Robert Douroux. Each of the lofts has two
bedrooms and a large studio plus four bathrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Elaine Spierer at Re/Max Beach Cities, Marina del Rey, has the
listing on the one loft that remains on the market. The asking price
is just under $2 million.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding "Fed Up With Noisy Leaf Blowers" by Stephen Glassman and
Donie Vanitzian, Nov. 17: It is ironic that in a state where smoking
is banned in bars and filters are fitted to gasoline pumps, residents
are subjected to carcinogenic fumes from garden equipment.</LD>
<LD>   While most indicators of smog have decreased in the Southland in
recent years, pollution from unburned fuel -- such as that expelled
from two-stroke gardening engines -- continues to rise.</LD>
<LD>   It is only a matter of time before the evidence is strong enough
to ban these engines statewide, but until then, there are several
steps we can take.</LD>
<TE>   If you live in Los Angeles, you are lucky enough to have the law
on your side, and you can make local law enforcement aware that you
consider your health and peace a priority. Other actions that you can
take include finding a gardening service that is committed to
blower-free gardening.</TE>
<TE>   Condo residents can rake and sweep themselves; it saves everyone
money on hired gardeners, is pleasant and is better for the plants
(most local hedges will not bloom because they are over-edged, and
many flowers and shrubs are weed-whacked out of existence).</TE>
<TE>   If you move, let the board (or landlord) know that the disruptive
gardening was a factor.</TE>

<LD>Will and Gaby Smith didn't honeymoon in Hawaii, Las Vegas or Mexico.
Instead, the newlyweds, who tied the knot Nov. 9, spent the first
weeks of their married life driving through neighborhoods in Orange
County with a Thomas Guide and real estate listings in hand.</LD>
<LD>   And why not? The Hawthorne couple, who have a 9-month-old son, has
walked through about 60 open houses and previewed hundreds of homes
on the Internet since their engagement about a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   "We want a place so we can get settled," Will said. "We want
something with a lot of land. I have memories playing baseball and
football in my own backyard. I remember how important it was [as a
kid] to have all that space."</LD>
<TE>   Beyond blissful domesticity, the Smiths are motivated by low
interest rates. But as home prices in Southern California have
reached record highs, Will is having second thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   "The prices for homes are ridiculous right now," said Will, 31, a
computer training specialist for Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian
in Newport Beach. "I want to take advantage of the rates, but still I
worry that right now might not be the right time."</TE>
<TE>   Still, apartment living has gotten tiresome. They worry that
little William wakes neighbors at night when he cries, and they can't
predict when their rent will go up. On top of that, the hour or more
commute to Will's job 45 miles away is starting to wear on him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough leaving home in the morning before the sun comes up
and getting home after it's already down," Will said.</TE>
<TE>   The couple fear that getting a loan will be difficult. Will has
three items on his credit report that he is disputing. Totaling
$3,500, they amount to nothing more than financial mix-ups: a deposit
on a cell phone that should have been used for a final bill, a $3,000
student loan that was supposed to be forgiven but wasn't, and
confusion on a corporate American Express card charge that should
have been paid by his previous employer.</TE>
<TE>   Will, who grosses about $4,000 a month in salary and other
consulting work and is the only wage earner in the family, also is
concerned about his newness in his job: He's only been at Hoag since
August. Additionally, because the couple has only about $8,000 in
cash in money market accounts, an IRA and savings, they will have to
rely on Will's mother to assist with a down payment, money she will
have only after refinancing her home in Gardena.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the Smiths' concerns, Maria Gain, an assistant vice
president of Real Estate Originations with Mission Federal Credit
Union in San Diego, was able to approve the couple for a 30-year,
fixed Federal Housing Administration loan of $199,500 at an interest
rate of 5.5%. That will allow the Smiths to purchase a home for
$210,000. "With an FHA loan, we are getting an approval, and we don't
even have to have the disputed items resolved," Gain said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Gain, an FHA loan is more forgiving on credit issues
compared with a conventional loan. And Will's new job isn't an issue
because he had worked in a similar position for 3 1/2 years, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "All Will did was move to another employer, but he's doing the
same thing," Gain said. "He could have been on the job one week and
it wouldn't have mattered."</TE>
<TE>   The loan will require 5% down, roughly $10,500, and about $5,500
in closing costs. The couple's monthly mortgage, padded for expected
homeowner's fees for a condo or townhome, would run about $1,573 --
more than double the $705 the couple pays for their one-bedroom
apartment. That monthly payment would represent a 49% income-to-debt
ratio, the percentage of the Smiths' gross monthly income for housing
and all other living expenses. Gain felt that ratio was high but
workable since Will's income will increase with raises and bonuses in
his job.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen ratios approved at 50% or 60% total expense," Gain
said. "But I like to caution buyers to make sure they feel
comfortable with that large of a house payment."</TE>
<TE>   To secure the deal, Will's mother would need to send a signed
letter to Mission Federal stating the money she is giving Will and
Gaby from refinancing her home is a "gift" and not expected to be
repaid. Mission Federal would additionally need to verify Will and
Gaby had received those funds before the close of escrow.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the financing issues resolved, they know from their
yearlong search that buying a home in that price range in Orange
County will be hard.</TE>
<TE>   Finding a single-family home for $210,000 will be impossible,
according to Mary Jane Cambria, a Realtor and broker with Star Real
Estate in Huntington Beach, who recommended a townhome instead.</TE>
<TE>   Although the couple would prefer a single-family home with a big
yard, they said they would consider townhomes, provided they were in
a nice area, such as Rancho Santa Margarita.</TE>
<TE>   But living there may be out of reach. According to DataQuick
Information Services, a La Jolla research firm, the median price for
a condo there has more than doubled from $100,000 in 1996 to $240,000
today.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Cambria said that appreciation in the community had
slowed somewhat, she predicted prices will continue to go up steadily
and recommended the couple buy now rather than wait.</TE>
<TE>   She was able to find five townhomes listed in the area that
matched the Smiths' minimum criteria of two bedrooms, one bath and a
garage.</TE>
<TE>   The townhomes ranged from 847 to 920 square feet and were priced
between $214,000 and $224,900 -- still within the Smiths' range if
they made a low offer. "We can hope," Cambria said of offering under
list price. "But in this market, sellers aren't budging much."</TE>
<TE>   Cambria then widened her search and located six similar townhomes
between $192,000 and $225,000 in Fountain Valley, Huntington Beach
and Santa Ana. The properties were a little bit larger, ranging from
796 to 1,107 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   But Will and Gaby disliked all of the homes. Some of the Rancho
Santa Margarita townhomes, they said, had poor floor plans with too
much of a separation between the master and baby's bedrooms. Others,
they said, were in neighborhoods they felt were on the decline.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Gaby and Will decided to risk prices rising further
and rent an apartment in Costa Mesa, five minutes from Will's work,
for just $100 more a month.</TE>
<TE>   "I have the patience to wait out the storm," Will said. "I have
the patience to wait for a good deal."</TE>

<TE>   Makeover subjects: Gaby and Will Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Occupations: Gaby Smith, 26, a stay-at-home mother; Will Smith,
31, a computer training specialist at Hoag hospital in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Gross monthly income: $4,000 from salary and other consulting
work.</TE>
<TE>   Goal: To purchase a single-family home in Orange County,
preferably in Rancho Santa Margarita.</TE>
<TE>   The problem: Will is new in his job and has collections on his
credit report that he is disputing. The couple has limited funds for
a down payment and worry that home prices in Orange County are out of
reach.</TE>
<TE>   Recommendations:</TE>
<TE>   Buy now to take advantage of low interest rates. Homes continue to
appreciate; you will probably pay more for the same house a year from
now.</TE>
<TE>   Look into an FHA loan, which can be more forgiving of previous
credit problems. If you must change jobs and are planning to buy a
home, try to stay in the same field or career to show consistency.</TE>
<TE>   Research homes and neighborhoods on the Internet. Narrowing areas
down can make the search more efficient.</TE>

<HD>Revised law clarifies security deposit issues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H. May Spitz</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Topping the list of disputes between landlords and tenants is the use
and alleged abuse of security deposits.</LD>
<LD>   In an effort to address security deposit problems, Section 1950.5
of the Civil Code has been revised, with sections added. The new law,
AB 2330, was sponsored by Assemblywoman Carole Midgen (D-San
Francisco) and takes effect Jan. 1.</LD>
<LD>   Triggered when a tenant gives 30 days' written notice to the
landlord, the law adds a provision that requires landlords to give
written notice back to the tenant. Why? According to the law, when
the tenant moves out the "landlord shall notify the tenant in writing
of his or her option to request an initial inspection and of his or
her right to be present at the inspection." In other words, when a
tenant gets ready to move out, the landlord will be required by law
to offer an inspection.</LD>
<TE>   Until now, most tenants simply moved out, with the landlord left
to figure out repair, responsibility and cost details.</TE>
<TE>   While move-out inspections are not new, requiring them by law with
written notice adds another dimension. The law further requires
tenant and landlord to arrange inspection a minimum of two weeks
before the boxes head out the door. If the tenant doesn't want an
inspection, he or she has to sign a release.</TE>
<TE>   If an inspection is desired, then it is supposed to take place
with the landlord and tenant present. Forty-eight hours' notice is
required. If the tenant doesn't show up, the landlord may proceed
with the inspection.</TE>
<TE>   The tenant then has the option of making any repairs before moving
out. The law is silent on repair details, but common sense should
prevail. For example, if a tenant replaced the dining room light with
another fixture, the owner can ask that the original one be
professionally reinstalled (because electrical items are subject to
code regulations).</TE>
<TE>   Tenants who painted present a challenge, especially if the type of
paint is different from what the landlord provided. With the new law,
the tenant is given the option to perform the repair. But who decides
what level is good enough to cover the situation?</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, splitting the cost of repairs may be the best
solution. An itemized written security deposit statement and a check
(if applicable) are still legally due to the tenant, postmarked
within 21 days.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the landlord and tenant can agree, resolution may be up to
a judge in Small Claims Court. If the court holds the landlord liable
for bad faith by not returning the deposit fairly or on time, the
award becomes larger. The new maximum is equal to double the value of
the original security deposit. Previously, the penalty to landlords
was a flat $600.</TE>
<TE>   In terms of definitions, the code is virtually unchanged, with
security deposit deductions allowed for such items as unpaid rent and
repairs of damage. The term "exclusive of ordinary wear and tear"
caused by tenant, guest or licensee of the tenant remains unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   The deposit deduction for cleaning the unit remains virtually the
same. Added is a detail effective for leases after Jan. 1, which
allows for cleaning up to the same level as at move-in.</TE>
<TE>   Use a detailed walk-through checklist at move-in and avoid
straining your memory later. The California Department of Consumer
Affairs offers one online at www.dca.ca.gov/legal/ landlordbook. Tips
on repair and move-out can also be found at the site.</TE>

<HD>Holiday shopping</HD>
<DH>With low interest rates continuing, the expected seasonal
slowdown in home sales just isn't materializing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Wedner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Conventional wisdom holds that when Thanksgiving rolls around, home
sellers put away their welcome mats. Not this year.</LD>
<LD>   Real estate experts say that, with mortgage interest rates as low
as they've been in 40 years and demand for housing as high as it's
ever been, buyers and sellers this year will dispel the long-held
notion that transactions come to a halt until after New Year's Day.</LD>
<LD>   "I used to dread the end of the year, but not now," said James
Joseph, owner of Century 21 Grisham-Joseph in Whittier. "We're
experiencing the least slowdown in about 20 years."</LD>
<TE>   Agents from San Diego to Ventura report that homes of all prices,
but especially in the lower and middle ranges, are being sold nearly
as soon as they're listed.</TE>
<TE>   The fear of interest rate hikes continues to propel buyers into a
market that shows no sign of slowing.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this will be my best holiday season ever," said Ron Wynn,
an agent at Coldwell Banker in Santa Monica. These days, "buyers are
coming out in the rain, and they're coming out at midnight."</TE>
<TE>   Wynn, whose office handles sales in the $700,000 to $1.3 million
range in Santa Monica, Westwood and Cheviot Hills, said that, despite
high prices and bidding wars, buyers continue to seek homes in the
tight Westside market.</TE>
<TE>   One of Wynn's clients, a highly qualified married couple with cash
and loan approval, has been bidding on 1,700-square-foot "starter
homes" (at $750,000) in Westwood for two years now. The eager
first-time buyers have been outbid in multiple-offer situations half
a dozen times, but they hope their luck will change this month, when
they expect less competition.</TE>
<TE>   Hancock Park seller Connie McCreight said she purposely put her
4,700-square foot, $1.95-million home on the market two days after
Thanksgiving to attract those she believes are the serious shoppers
at this time of year.</TE>
<TE>   "People are busy and are traveling now, so if buyers show up,
they're probably the most interested ones," McCreight said. "Also, my
home never looks better than at this time of year, when it's dressed
up for the holidays. It's a better time than ever to get a jump on
the market."</TE>
<TE>   That seems to be the case in Newport Beach, where agents report no
slowdown in sales.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Wells, an agent at Cannery Village Realty, said that his
office recently received several offers for an oceanfront tear-down
listed at $1.75 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Homes that are priced well on the water are on the market for a
second," Wells said. "If they're not moving, it's because they're
overpriced."</TE>
<TE>   The median price of new and existing homes and condos in Los
Angeles County in October was a record $273,000. The 20.3% jump from
last year represents the biggest increase since May 1989, according
to DataQuick Information Services of La Jolla. A total of 10,422
homes were sold in L.A. County in October, the most for any October
since 1989, when 11,403 were sold.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, the median price of existing homes rose 20.9% to
$393,000. The median price of condominiums, which recently have seen
a surge of sales, was $252,000 in October, up 20.9% from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Agents in the San Fernando Valley complain that low inventory and
strong demand for starter homes continue to promote bidding wars,
especially in areas such as Sherman Oaks and Studio City. Offers for
homes in the $450,000 range there are "flying out the door," said Dan
Drantch, a broker associate at Coldwell Banker in Encino.</TE>
<TE>   First-time buyers face the greatest obstacles, he said, enduring
multiple offers on homes that are on the market, at most, two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Entry-level buyers all over the Southland are feeling the squeeze.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, the affordability index, which measures the
percentage of households able to afford the median home price, fell
to 30% in September, from 35% a year earlier, according to the
California Assn. of Realtors. San Diego County posted the lowest
affordability in Southern California, at 21%.</TE>
<TE>   For those trying to get a home in the lower- or middle-range
market, flexibility often is the key to winning bidding wars, said
Arlene Kovalivker, a Young Realtors agent in Westlake Village.</TE>
<TE>   Her recent clients, Newbury Park townhome owners Steve and Jana
Giboney, quickly turned an offer to buy a four-bedroom home
contingent upon the sale of their townhome into an offer with no
sales contingency upon learning that another buyer had made such an
offer shortly after their own.</TE>
<TE>   The couple, who are confident they can sell their two-bedroom
townhome within the 45-day escrow period, got the house.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the way the market is," Kovalivker said. "The 'starter'
market is crazy."</TE>
<TE>   David and Kim Clesceri, La Mirada residents, used a different
strategy recently to get the four-bedroom home in Brea that they
wanted. David, a Whittier real estate agent, hand-delivered his
offer, $2,000 over the asking price, which included a cover letter
expressing the couple's strong desire to raise their 6-month-old
daughter in that house.</TE>
<TE>   The sales agent pressed the couple's case by phone with the
sellers, who were out of town, while Clesceri waited anxiously in his
car.</TE>
<TE>   The emotional appeal helped him land the home that attracted three
other bids the same day.</TE>
<TE>   At the crux of this frenetic activity are record low interest
rates, which are expected to fuel sales through the holiday season,
said Nima Nattagh, an analyst with FNC Inc., a consultant to the
mortgage industry. "People are anxious about the economy turning and
don't want to delay the buying decision."</TE>
<TE>   The average interest on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage with 1
point in Southern California in October was 5.9%, down from about
6.9% a year ago, according to National Financial News Services, which
tracks such data. Average rates last week hovered around 6%.</TE>
<TE>   "With rates the way they are, if a home buyer sees a good product
and can afford it, they will buy it, irrespective of the time of
year," Nattagh said.</TE>

<LD>After two straight years of record figures, home sales are projected
to slip next year but remain strong, according to the National Assn.
of Realtors.</LD>
<LD>   NAR expects existing home sales to finish at 5.52 million units
this year, a 4.2% increase over last year's record 5.3 million units,
according to NAR chief economist David Lereah, who said that next
year's sales should slow to 5.29 million units.</LD>
<LD>   New-home sales are forecast to rise 5.6% to a record 960,000 units
this year, then ease next year to 924,000, which would be the second
highest on record.</LD>

<HD>High court hears housing bias case</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times wire reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday in a case of a
mixed-race couple stymied in efforts to buy a new home by a real
estate agent who they said called them a "salt-and-pepper team." The
question for the justices: Can the couple sue the agent's boss?</LD>
<LD>   Real estate company owners should be held accountable when their
employees discriminate, Robert Schwemm, lawyer for Emma and David
Holley of Twentynine Palms, Calif., told the justices.</LD>
<LD>   But Realtors argued that the 34-year-old Fair Housing Act
outlawing racial discrimination in housing should be used only to
punish those who discriminate, not their employers.</LD>
<TE>   Emma Holley is black and her husband is white. They sued agent
Grove Crank; his employer, Triad Inc. of Twentynine Palms; and
company owner Dave Meyer in 1997 after Crank allegedly used epithets
to describe the couple to the builder of a home they wanted to buy.
Crank also refused to make their offer on the house.</TE>
<TE>   The Holleys were joined in their suit by the builder, Brooks
Bauer, who sold the house for $20,000 less than the couple was ready
to pay.</TE>
<TE>   No one claims that Meyer took part in or knew of any
discrimination. But he should be held liable because he failed to
ensure that his agent complied with the law, Schwemm said.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Boswell</AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Dan Snyder, Abe Pollin and Ted Leonsis began their seasons with one
thing in common. The owners all thought for sure they'd improved
their Redskins, Wizards and Capitals and would surely make the
playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   After all, they'd brought new stars to town such as Jeremiah
Trotter, Jessie Armstead, Jerry Stackhouse and Robert Lang. They'd
signed first-round draft picks Patrick Ramsey, Jared Jeffries and
Juan Dixon. Most dramatically, the Redskins even signed Steve
Spurrier to the richest coaching contract in NFL history. The Caps
had a new coach, too, in young Bruce Cassidy.</LD>
<LD>   "Steve Spurrier will bring a supercharged, exciting and dynamic
brand of football to our fans," Snyder proclaimed.</LD>
<TE>   "The talent that has been accumulated since the end of last season
is endless," Wizards General Manager Wes Unseld said.</TE>
<TE>   Leonsis pointed proudly to three new stalwart players he had
added, plus three old standout Caps returning from injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Now these owners have something else in common, something they'd
never have guessed. All three teams have losing records and, if the
playoffs started right now, none would make it.</TE>
<TE>   Seldom has a city seen three talented teams fall flat at once. All
see it. No one denies it. But everybody's trying to reverse it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absolutely amazing. It's sickening. Our fans deserve more,"
defensive tackle Dan Wilkinson (now out for the season with a calf
injury) said after the Redskins blew a 10-point lead at Dallas on
Thanksgiving Day, all but killing any playoff hopes.</TE>
<TE>   The Wizards' Michael Jordan was so miffed at his young,
inconsistent teammates that he vowed that if they didn't improve,
he'd just have to play more himself. They didn't, so now he has.</TE>
<TE>   Cassidy was so exasperated, he snapped, "You have to ask when they
are going to get mad. I'm looking for some pride."</TE>
<TE>   What's an owner to do? Read the riot act? Ride out the storm and
hope for better days? Or smile and swear the glass is half full?</TE>
<TE>   To each his own, it appears. The three owners, in separate
interviews this week, displayed the whole range of responses -- from
annoyance to disappointment to defiant optimism.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm heartbroken," said Leonsis of the 11-13-2 Caps. "I'm hopeful
they wake up. But if they don't ... changes will be made."</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we're disappointed," Snyder said of the 5-7 Redskins,
"but we are not that far from being successful."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm wonderfully optimistic. We will make the playoffs," Pollin
said of the 8-10 Wizards. "Wanna make a bet that we don't?"</TE>
<TE>   Leonsis's reaction was by far the most dramatic, and the most
different from his usual genial demeanor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's when we lose in this unorganized, dispassionate way that it
upsets me greatly. ... It is our lack of work ethic that is
concerning me," said the Caps' owner. "This should be a shot across
the bow. I want to see them play with effort, passion and commitment.
And take joy in this great game that they are paid a lot to play."</TE>
<TE>   For Leonsis, who's bent over backward to give his players what
they've asked for, including a new coach, this was a true eruption.
Told about his frustration with them before their Tuesday night game,
the Caps went out and played by far their best game of the season,
beating the Penguins, 4-1. Who says reading the riot act never works?
But will Leonsis's well-deserved lecture stick?</TE>
<TE>   The Redskins' failure has been the most stunning. For the third
year, they talked bravely. In 2000, they had a $100 million payroll.
In 2001, proven winner Marty Schottenheimer was a lock for the
playoffs, right? This year, Snyder added two Pro Bowl linebackers,
Spurrier and well-regarded defensive coach Marvin Lewis. Spurrier
even crowed that he'd give Snyder a game ball after beating Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have to worry about any game balls on this side. They
kicked our butts," said Spurrier on Thanksgiving. Right now, the
"supercharged" Redskins have trouble making an extra point.</TE>
<TE>   There's soul-searching at Redskins Park these days and maybe some
predictable scapegoating, too. The kicker's been fired. (Oh, that's
original.) And Spurrier is singing, "I gotta be me." He now claims
that he'll go down "pitchin' and catchin' " it since "Dan Snyder
didn't hire me to run the ball 45 times a game."</TE>
<TE>   "Our needs are glaring," Snyder said this week, referring to the
need for a couple of interior linemen and a quality speed receiver.
"During this off-season, we're going to fix those needs.</TE>
<TE>   "If two or three games go our way, we're right in the hunt, which
is where we'll be in the future."</TE>

<HD>Brothers Dreaming Big</HD>
<DH>Klitschko boxers may never fight one another, but two
heavyweight titles could be a reality</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Dahlberg</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Wladimir and Vitali Klitschko will never fight each other. That's
done, settled, never to be argued about, no matter how many millions
are thrown at the Ukrainian brothers.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't want to break our mother's heart," Wladimir said. "It
would be too painful."</LD>
<LD>   So instead of trying to become the undisputed heavyweight champion
of the world, the brothers have settled on another goal -- titles for
both.</LD>
<TE>   Luckily for the Klitschkos, the days of one heavyweight champion
are long gone.</TE>
<TE>   "Our dream will be true if we both are champions," Wladimir said.
"The reality is we're not talking about flying to Mars. It is very
real."</TE>
<TE>   It might become even more real Saturday night when Wladimir, a
26-year-old Olympic gold medalist, fights Jameel McCline in a battle
of two massive heavyweights that will go a long way toward making
clear just how good Klitschko really is.</TE>
<TE>   And it will become very real in the spring, when Vitali is
scheduled to fight Lennox Lewis in his bid to become the first of the
brothers to win a major heavyweight title.</TE>
<TE>   "The feeling is that it is so close," Wladimir said. "We're like
five minutes before 12 o'clock. It's not 12 o'clock yet, but it's
very close."</TE>
<TE>   Boxing has never seen anything like the Klitschko brothers, who
own advanced degrees, speak four languages, respect their parents and
do everything together.</TE>
<TE>   Wladimir was in the corner last month in Germany when Vitali
stopped Larry Donald in the 10th round to set up his fight with
Lewis. And Vitali will be in the corner Saturday night when Wladimir
meets McCline in a scheduled 12-round fight for his lightly regarded
WBO heavyweight title.</TE>
<TE>   The fight, televised by HBO, is expected to begin about 11 p.m.
EST. It tops a card that also includes Floyd Mayweather Jr. defending
his WBC lightweight title against Jose Luis Castillo.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need to talk to each other. It's eye language," Vitali
said. "I've known my brother 26 years and we know each other like a
coach. Sometimes we can give good advice without even talking."</TE>
<TE>   Wladimir (39-1, 36 knockouts) is a 4-1 favorite over McCline in a
fight that matches two of the biggest heavyweights around. Klitschko
is 6-foot-7 and 240 pounds, while the chiseled McCline is 6-6 and 263
pounds.</TE>
<TE>   McCline (28-2-3, 16 knockouts) has won a series of fights to come
into his own at the age of 32, but the younger Klitschko brother is
eyed by many as the heavyweight champion of the future.</TE>
<TE>   Klitschko has a stinging left jab, power in both hands and an
increasing reservoir of ring savvy he began building after winning
the 1996 super heavyweight Olympic title for his native Ukraine.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Byrd, who fights Evander Holyfield for the vacant IBF title,
fought both Klitschkos in Germany, beating Vitali when he didn't get
off his stool after the ninth round because of a shoulder injury and
losing a decision to Wladimir.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd was impressed by both.</TE>
<TE>   "They can both flat out fight," Byrd said. "They have the size and
now they have a lot of confidence they can beat American fighters."</TE>
<TE>   McCline, who will make $1 million and has the potential to make a
lot more if he can win, said he believes Klitschko may be reading his
own press clippings a bit too much.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he may be overlooking me," said McCline, who had only one
amateur fight after spending five years in prison and is a late
bloomer in the ring. "They've got a great publicity team pumping them
up. Every thing you read it's Klitschko this, Klitschko that."</TE>
<TE>   The Klitschko fight was moved to the top of the card originally
scheduled to be headed by the Mayweather-Castillo fight at the
Mandalay Bay hotel-casino. The change was made by HBO, which is in
the third fight of a six-fight, $12.5 million contract with
Mayweather but has been unhappy with the fighter as an attraction.</TE>
<TE>   Mayweather, who beat Castillo in a disputed decision in April to
take the lightweight title, refused to show up at the prefight press
conference, saying he was tired of negative things being written
about him.</TE>

<HD>With Four Weeks to Play, Parity Name of the Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leonard Shapiro</AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When New York Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi was working as an
executive at NFL headquarters in the early 1970s, he often helped
formulate the regular season schedule. Thirty years later, he still
remembers the mantra of Commissioner Pete Rozelle.</LD>
<LD>   "It was always 'Good teams against good teams and bad teams
against bad teams' early in the season," Accorsi said. "He didn't
want good teams playing bad teams because it would probably mean some
of the bad teams would get off to 0-3 or 1-3 starts and would be out
of contention in the first month. He knew it was important to have a
lot of teams in contention for as long as possible."</LD>
<LD>   With 32 teams now and a schedule that has every team in one
division playing 14 of its 16 games against common opponents,
Rozelle's legacy -- meaningful games and a large number of teams in
contention over the last month of the season -- still remains very
much a part of the NFL.</LD>
<TE>   Especially this year. With four weeks left in the regular season,
only eight teams have been mathematically eliminated from playoff
contention -- just two in the AFC.</TE>
<TE>   "You can say what you want about parity, or mediocrity, or
offenses having all the rules advantages over the defenses, our game
is still unbelievably competitive," said Ron Wolf, the former Green
Bay Packers general manager. "That's really what sets it apart from
anything else out there."</TE>
<TE>   In the AFC, only Cincinnati and Houston have been eliminated and,
in the NFC, Carolina, Chicago, Minnesota, Detroit, Arizona and
Seattle are out. Even more astounding, in the AFC, two division races
are tied, and in the other two, all three second-place teams are
within 1 1/2 games of the lead.</TE>
<TE>   No AFC team can clinch a division title this week, and it seems
likely that virtually every race in the conference could go down to
the final weekend. Pittsburgh seems to have the easiest road to the
playoffs, with only one of its four remaining games against a winning
team, three of their final four games at home, including their next
two against lowly Houston and Carolina. Defending Super Bowl champion
New England, tied with Miami for the AFC East lead, has the toughest
road, playing four legitimate contenders down the stretch -- Buffalo
at home, away against Tennessee and back home against the Jets and
the season finale against Miami, the other AFC East co-leader.</TE>
<TE>   It's a little different in the NFC, where Green Bay has clinched
the weak North over three 3-9 foes, and Philadelphia, San Francisco
and Tampa Bay can win their divisions today under scenarios involving
other contending teams. Atlanta also has a chance to clinch a
wild-card spot.</TE>
<TE>   But the NFC bracket in the playoffs is probably full, with only
home-field advantage still to be settled. The only close division
race is in the South, with Tampa Bay at 9-3, the Falcons at 8-3-1 and
the New Orleans Saints at 8-4. Atlanta can take the division lead if
it beats the Bucs in Tampa today, but all three times seem likely to
be playing in the postseason.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia has a three-game lead on the Giants in the NFC East
and San Francisco has a three-game lead on St. Louis in the NFC West.
Tampa Bay and Green Bay lead the NFC home-field race, and if they
remain tied for the best record in the conference, Tampa Bay would
have home-field advantage based on its 21-7 victory over the Packers
two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   The league has not gone through the season without problems or
controversy. There has been a flurry of helmet-to-helmet hits and
subsequent fines, players being suspended for violations of the
substance-abuse policy, injuries to big-time stars such as Kurt
Warner, Donovan McNabb and Ray Lewis, and some very frightening
injuries as well.</TE>
<TE>   But at the moment the league seems to be riding another crest of
popularity with fans.</TE>
<TE>   Games have been wide open this year, with eight all-time offensive
records threatened -- including touchdowns, net and gross passing
yards and 300-yard throwing games by quarterbacks. There are emerging
stars such as Michael Vick in Atlanta, LaDainian Tomlinson and Drew
Brees in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to having so many teams in contention late in the
season, there have been 20 overtime games, one short of the record
set in 1995. And teams trailing by 10 points in the fourth quarter
have come back to win 13 times, threatening the record of 17 set in
1982.</TE>
<TE>   Of 192 games played, 105 have been decided by eight points or less
(54 percent). Last week, 12 of the 16 games were in that category.
And with defenses more handcuffed than ever by rules restricting
holding, bump-and-run or contact down field, offenses are putting
record numbers of points on the board every week.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, free agency and the salary cap, in effect since 1993,
have been contributors. With yearly player turnover at about 33
percent per team, some teams take longer to find their stride. When
they do, long winning streaks seem to be in order for many.</TE>
<TE>   "Teams need time to jell," said New York Jet General Manager Terry
Bradway, whose team started 1-3. "Look at us. We had six new starters
on defense and a new quarterback who came in early in the season. We
really struggled early, and then it just started to click. Guys
learned what their teammates could and couldn't do, they understood
the system, and then we get right back in it."</TE>
<TE>   It also means the end of long-running dominance of teams such as
the Cleveland Browns and New York Giants in the 1950s, the Baltimore
Colts and Green Bay Packers in the 1960s, the Pittsburgh Steelers and
Miami Dolphins in the 1970s and the Redskins and 49ers in the '80s.</TE>
<TE>   This year, there hasn't been a dominant, fearsome team.</TE>

<HD>Elliott Named Most Popular Driver Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Harris</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- Although Bill Elliott's only NASCAR title came 14 years
ago, fans have made him their perennial champion.</LD>
<LD>   The longtime NASCAR Winston Cup star was informed Friday that he's
been selected as Most Popular Driver Award for the 16th time.</LD>
<LD>   Nobody else comes close. Even King Richard Petty, a seven-time
champion, won the award only seven times.</LD>
<TE>   Elliott has won the award so many times, the National Motorsport
Press Association, which oversees the voting, will name the award the
Bill Elliott Trophy after the 1988 Winston Cup champion retires.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything I do, the fans are so supportive. I'm just so sorry I
can't be there to tell everybody in person how much this means to
me," said Elliott, who was unable to get to New York for the
presentation because of inclement weather.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking by telephone from his home in Blairsville, Ga., Elliott
added, "The fan base I have is real strong. They support me when I
have a bad year or a good year."</TE>
<TE>   Elliott's career has revived since he joined car owner Ray
Evernham on his start-up team in 2001. He ended a six-year winless
period with one victory that year and added two more wins in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Using the worldwide web, a record 3 1/2 million ballots were
counted in the vote sponsored by Grands Biscuits.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ROOKIE NO MORE: Ryan Newman, who won the 2002 Rookie of the Year
Award in a close competition with Jimmie Johnson, said he never
really thought of himself as a rookie.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line, it's just a label," he said as he prepared to
accept the award Friday night at the NASCAR Awards Ceremony. "I'm no
different than Ricky Rudd or Dale Jarrett or Rusty Wallace. We're all
doing the same job."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he is relieved he won't have to answer questions about
being a rookie any more, Newman said, "There will still be a lot of
questions, obviously questions about a sophomore jinx or sophomore
slump."</TE>
<TE>   How will he avoid falling into the second-year blues that hit so
many top rookies?</TE>
<TE>   "You can't get lazy and you can't get cocky or overconfident,"
Newman said. "I'm with a great team, and it takes a good driver and a
good team to get the consistency you need to be successful. I think
we should be championship contenders next year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AWARDS GALORE: Checks and trophies were handed out in bunches
Friday as part of NASCAR's Champion's Week. Among them:</TE>
<TE>   * NASCAR president Mike Helton was presented the Myers Brothers
Award, given each year to an individual or group making an
outstanding contribution to the sport. The award is named after
NASCAR pioneers Billy and Bobby Myers and presented by the National
Motorsports Press Association.</TE>
<TE>   * Stewart won the $76,000 76 Gasoline Champion's Award, while Jeff
Green got $76,000 for the 76 NASCAR Motor Oil Award. They were the
highest finishing drivers using that particular product.</TE>
<TE>   * Newman got a $100,000 check for winning the Bud Pole Award. His
six poles during the season were the most by any driver.</TE>
<TE>   * Mark Cronquist, the chief engine builder for Joe Gibbs Racing,
which fields cars for Stewart and Bobby Labonte, won $77,000 as the
Clevite Engine Builder of the Year.</TE>
<TE>   * Jeff Gordon won $75,000 for taking the Gatorade Front Runner
Award, given to the driver who leads the most laps.</TE>
<TE>   * The $75,000 Mechanix Wear Pit Crew of the Year Award went to the
crew of the No. 40 Chip Ganassi Racing Dodge, driven by Sterling
Marlin until he was injured late in the season. The crew is headed by
crew chief Lee McCall.</TE>
<TE>   * Kurt Busch, the hottest driver in the Winston Cup Series late in
the year, winning three of the last five races, was presented $75,000
for the Outback Steakhouse Bloomin' Onion Favorite Driver of the Year
Award, voted on a race-by-race basis.</TE>
<TE>   * Matt Kenseth, Busch's Roush Racing teammate, won the $75,000
Waste Management Picking up Places Award, given to the driver who
improves his position the most during the season.</TE>

<HD>Ward Finally Getting Noticed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Robinson</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>Hines Ward sometimes gets overlooked.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe it's because he lacks the classic receiver's speed and size.
Or maybe it's because his production comes in dependable bunches
rather than big-play bursts.</LD>
<LD>   Even the Pittsburgh Steelers themselves do not always fully
appreciate what he means to their offense.</LD>
<TE>   When Ward broke John Stallworth's club record by catching a pass
for a 68th consecutive game today in Jacksonville, the Steelers did
not realize it at the time. They made no mention of it until a day
later.</TE>
<TE>   Such slights are routine to Ward. He changed positions so
frequently early in his college career at Georgia -- from tailback to
quarterback and back again, then to receiver -- that it might have
contributed to his slide to the third round of the 1998 NFL draft.</TE>
<TE>   Even after he proved to be a far better receiver than the Steelers
expected, catching 61 passes as a rookie, they drafted wide receivers
-- Troy Edwards and Plaxico Burress -- in the first round the next
two years.</TE>
<TE>   "I never really played the position (in high school), so I really
wasn't as polished a receiver as the others," said Ward, who is
listed as 6 feet and 200 pounds. "I wasn't as tall as the other
receivers. I came here as the fourth wide receiver in four-wide
(sets), and I played a lot of special teams and just got better."</TE>
<TE>   So much so, he could break his Steelers single-season receptions
record Sunday against Houston. He has 89 catches in 12 games, only
five fewer than his team-record 94 last season, when he made the Pro
Bowl for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Burress is regarded by many around the league as the Steelers'
most dangerous receiver; he had a team-record 253-yard game against
Atlanta last month. But Ward frequently does the most damage.</TE>
<TE>   Ward is second in the AFC in catches and yards (1,090), and he has
led the Steelers in receptions in five of their last six games. He
has three 100-yard games in his last four starts.</TE>
<TE>   What makes him so productive?</TE>
<TE>   "Everything," said quarterback Tommy Maddox, who returns to the
lineup today after sitting out two weeks. "That's the thing. He's so
good at so many things. He plays the game hard, he practices hard,
he's very prepared for the game. He studies his opponent. He does all
the little things right."</TE>
<TE>   Even down to blocking, which until recent years was almost a lost
art among receivers. With the Steelers much more run-oriented than
most teams when Ward arrived, he was often used as much as a blocker
as a receiver.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, the Steelers sometimes use him as what essentially is an
undersized tight end, a blocker who doesn't hesitate to go up against
bigger players anywhere on the field.</TE>
<TE>   "I never let it discourage me," Ward said of the years he needed
to develop into a full-time starter. "I always went out there and
worked hard. Probably last year, with me getting an opportunity to
actually just be in there full time and not rotating, gave me the
opportunity to showcase what I really can do, given the opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Ward is having a better season than a year ago even though the
Steelers added rookie receiver Antwaan Randle El, potentially taking
away some of Ward's downfield plays.</TE>

<KH>COMMENTARY</KH>
<HD>Vick Runs to Top</HD>
<DH>Falcon quarterback is thriving despite conservative
offensive strategy</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Oates</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the last two months, Michael Vick, Atlanta's left-handed
quarterback, has been the hottest player in the NFL and, potentially,
the best of all time. Some of us have been suggesting that he already
is.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, even though Vick has the Falcons up to 8-3-1, the Fox
network, which televises the NFC's Sunday games, has presented him
nationally only once.</LD>
<LD>   In a dog-eat-dog TV era, that is sad programming. But it's about
to end.</LD>
<TE>   Atlanta will play Tampa Bay today in the televised game of the
week, and having battered eight defenses, Vick will again confront
the team with the NFL's best defensive plan and people. They stopped
him last time, 20-6, on Oct. 6.</TE>
<TE>   Was that fluke or harbinger?</TE>
<TE>   Or did Minneapolis see a new and drastically improved Vick model
last week when, incredibly, he ran for 173 yards and passed for 173
more?</TE>
<TE>   That day, nationally, Fox televised the Chicago Bears instead of
Vick. The Chicago Bears!</TE>
<TE>   Tough Line</TE>
<TE>   This is much too early in his career for Vick to have to face a
defense as solid as Tampa Bay's with a division title on the line. An
NFL sophomore, he is only 22. He has been Atlanta's starter since
only September. Moreover, Vick's coach, Dan Reeves, remains an
implacable conservative in a league that otherwise has steadily, if
slowly, been opening up.</TE>
<TE>   To beat Minnesota at Minnesota in overtime Sunday, 30-24, Vick got
his 173 passing yards in only 28 attempts -- by comparison with the
Vikings' 43 passes. And he produced his 173 yards rushing in 10 runs,
compared to the Vikings' 32.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa's offense with new Coach Jon Gruden is as weak as or weaker
than last year's with Coach Tony Dungy. But the defensive force that
Dungy left Gruden is still in place, and that's Vick's problem.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the problem is that the Buccaneer front four are so
effective that they rarely need blitzing help.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, there are almost always seven Tampa Bay pass-defense experts
well positioned in the secondary to blanket Vick's five receivers, or
to collar Vick if he takes off on the kind of 46-yard jaunt that beat
Minnesota in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   If he can win this one, on the road, Vick's road to the Super Bowl
will be wide open.</TE>
<TE>   Like Quicksilver</TE>
<TE>   Because so few fans nationally have ever seen him, they often ask,
what's he got? What's different? Opponents point to what they call
his "escapability," a word not yet in the dictionary though its
meaning is plain.</TE>
<TE>   In a quarterback pocket, he has the quickness and speed to escape
from sack-minded defensive players the instant they say gotcha. Not
every time, maybe, but usually. In other words, his foremost asset is
quicksilver mobility.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhat strangely, Vick is short for a quarterback. He stands
only 6 feet, if that much. He's also undersized for a modern runner,
going only 215 pounds, if that much. Yet these are doubtless two
reasons for his unearthly quickness and speed.</TE>
<TE>   You can't match Vick's agility if you're a 6-foot-5 passer like
USC's Carson Palmer or a 230-pound runner like Miami's Ricky
Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Born Running Back</TE>
<TE>   In innate football talent, the thing that's unique about Vick is
that he can throw a football hard, straight, near and far despite the
obvious truth that he's a born running back. On a major college team
in the 1920s or '30s, in an era when they didn't pass much, he would
have been an All-American halfback.</TE>
<TE>   They would have been comparing his speed, ability and versatility
to Red Grange's.</TE>
<TE>   Vick's personal problem is the conservatism of his coaches. On
every first-down play, Reeves would prefer to run one of Atlanta's
running backs, even though his quarterback isn't best suited for that
kind of football.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, Vick is the personification of a passing quarterback who,
scrambling on first down in a pass-first offense, would race even
farther than he does now.</TE>
<TE>   The cross that Vick keeps bearing these days is that on, say,
third and long, when first-down runs fail, Reeves sees little choice
but to call passes. And whenever such plays are imminent on second or
third down, every opponent gets into its strongest pass defense.</TE>
<TE>   In game after game, as a consequence, it's the young quarterback's
talent that gets the job done, not the coach's strategy. He is
hindered by that strategy, not helped.</TE>
<TE>   Namath's Game</TE>
<TE>   Just in time for the Christmas marketing season, a veteran NFL
executive, Don Weiss, is out with the definitive Super Bowl book,
"The Making of the Super Bowl," which Weiss subtitles "The Inside
Story of the World's Greatest Sporting Event." (McGraw-Hill $24.95.)</TE>
<TE>   As chief operating officer of all 36 of the "world's greatest"
games to date, Weiss, whose co-author was Chuck Day of Miami, points
to quarterback Joe Namath's upset victory over the old Baltimore
Colts in Super Bowl III as the one that "established the game's
credibility."</TE>
<TE>   The Colts, 18-point favorites, lost to the New York Jets, 16-7, on
that 1969 day in Miami's Orange Bowl when Namath called every play
for the Jets' offense -- the achievement that put him in the Pro
Football Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Some of us still rate him the best passer, better than Norm Van
Brocklin, better than Dan Marino, better than Vick.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss says that heading into Super Bowl III, the great fear among
NFL owners and executives was that a rout by the NFC champion Colts
-- following two lopsided wins by NFC champion Green Bay in Games I
and II -- would establish the AFC as inferior, thus wrecking the
so-called championship game as an annual event worth watching.</TE>
<TE>   Accordingly, it was Namath who made the Super Bowl what it is.</TE>
<TE>   Rozelle Revisited</TE>
<TE>   The most controversial section of Weiss' book deals with the
1960s, when the NFL and the AFL were effecting the merger that ended
their war and made possible the Super Bowl. According to Weiss, the
merger was opposed until the last possible instant by the late Pete
Rozelle, the NFL's commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, ever since that historic era, Rozelle has been seen in
another light altogether: He's widely considered to be the architect
of the merger and the father of the Super Bowl. Not so, Weiss states,
adding, "Conciliation was not on his agenda."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, relying on former Dallas executive Tex Schramm as his
source, Weiss states that a faction of six NFL club owners -- among
them the late Carroll Rosenbloom of the 1960s Colts and 1970s Los
Angeles Rams -- had vowed to merge, with or without Rozelle's
blessing.</TE>
<TE>   Their reason: War with the AFL was costing them too many millions.</TE>
<TE>   Wanted: a War</TE>
<TE>   The spokesman who was installed to break the news to Rozelle in
1966, according to Weiss, was Schramm, who told the commissioner that
the rebel faction would either "pursue the merger under Pete's
direction" or "pursue the merger without him."</TE>
<TE>   Only then, Weiss states, did Rozelle go along.</TE>
<TE>   The millions in player payments that made Rozelle's six owners
rebel had been forced on them by a new young AFL commissioner, Al
Davis, who now runs the Oakland Raiders. Davis' strategy: Steal their
best quarterbacks and their other good players.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, therefore, was the real architect or contractor of the
merger.</TE>
<TE>   Although Weiss argues against that, his report confirms the key
point about the 1960s NFL owners: Though loathing the AFL, they bowed
to Davis when faced with two unacceptable options: losing their
quarterbacks in a bidding war or losing too many millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, Davis didn't want a merger. He wanted war, not peace.
And, Weiss insists, so did Rozelle. It's a dramatic story.</TE>
<TE>   Bears Can Pass</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Bears are 3-9 in the new NFC North -- far behind the
9-3 Packers -- but that wouldn't be the case if they'd played the
season the way they played in Green Bay last week, when they took the
blinders off their pass-offense people.</TE>
<TE>   With Chicago passer Jim Miller in typical good form, hitting nine
receivers, the Bears outpassed Brett Favre and the Packers, 230 yards
to 215, on a freezing winter day in Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears will be in tropical Miami on Monday to play the
Dolphins, which is a tough place for any team to play. The Dolphins
can't win in arctic Buffalo, but they love life in Miami, which means
that Chicago won't.</TE>
<TE>   In Green Bay last week, however, the Bears, with Miller throwing
darts, opened a 14-3 first-half lead on a 72-yard touchdown drive
sustained on passes alone as the Bears' infamous run-first
strategists changed gears. Ten of the 12 calls Miller's coaches sent
in on that drive were passes that kept the Bears moving on the kind
of Wisconsin winter day that the Packers say they relish.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, moreover, who has the ability of a top-five NFL passer,
could have held the lead with better luck. He lost it only in freak
circumstances. After one of his typical long passes had gone true
toward its target -- putting the Bears on the Packer one-yard line
when the only way for Green Bay to prevent a completion was to
interfere with the receiver illegally -- there was a replay review.</TE>
<TE>   After the lengthy review, Chicago still was on the Packer one-yard
line. But everyone was a lot colder. In reasonable weather, it
wouldn't have mattered. But in the Green Bay freeze, the Bears had
stood around so long, waiting for the replay decision, that their
quarterback's hands were as numb as those of his center. They fumbled
the exchange, whereupon the Packers got the ball and drove it to the
winning field goal.</TE>
<TE>   So it was just another defeat for the Bears, who, if they'd
allowed Miller to pass that way in the pleasant fall weather of
October and November, could have mastered their good pass offense in
time to compete with Green Bay. Unquestionably, the Bears have the
right passer, receivers, running back and system. They have lacked
only the right play selection.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears are a living monument to the fear of the thrown ball
that plagues their coaching staff. With a pass-first attack -- with
an offense that passed on first down even part of the time -- they
could have been competitive in their division this season. For in
Miller and Anthony Thomas, the Bears have been led by a quarterback
and ballcarrier who, like all gifted offensive players, are more
successful when their coaches throw on first down. Most of the time.
Or half the time.</TE>
<TE>   Five Guesses Today</TE>
<TE>   * Tampa Bay over Atlanta by three points at Raymond James Stadium
for first in the NFC South. Most fans will be pulling for Michael
Vick, but Tampa's defensive front four are too good.</TE>
<TE>   * Tennessee over Indianapolis by a touchdown at Nashville
Coliseum. If his coach lets him throw, Steve McNair will win battle
against Peyton Manning.</TE>
<TE>   * Oakland over San Diego by a couple of points at Qualcomm
Stadium. Assuming both quarterbacks are injury-free, Rich Gannon will
overtake Drew Brees for first in the AFC West.</TE>
<TE>   * New England by a field goal over Buffalo at the new stadium in
Foxboro. With better receivers than Tom Brady's, Drew Bledsoe would
like to return in triumph, but that won't happen.</TE>
<TE>   * Denver by a touchdown over the New York Jets in East Rutherford.
Although new Jet passer Chad Pennington can beat most teams, the
Broncos are better all around.</TE>

<HD>Injuries at QB Give Martin Another Shot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>R.B. Fallstrom</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Jamie Martin is about to get another chance to change the bad
impression he made during the St. Louis Rams' 0-5 start.</LD>
<LD>   Martin began the year as Kurt Warner's backup, but he was pressed
into service in a 13-10 Week 4 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, putting up
decent numbers that didn't result in nearly enough points. The next
week was more of the same in a 37-13 loss to the 49ers.</LD>
<LD>   He hurt his knee against the Cowboys and the injury worsened after
the 49ers' game, so Marc Bulger stepped in to lead the Rams (5-7) to
five straight victories.</LD>
<TE>   Now comes the second chance for Martin. He will start today at
Kansas City because Warner is again sidelined by his troublesome
throwing hand and Bulger is out with a sprained index finger.</TE>
<TE>   "You always wonder," Martin said. "Marc starts having success and
all of a sudden I'm the third guy. Just like you're a couple plays
away from being in there, you're also a couple plays away from being
out of the league."</TE>
<TE>   During the long wait, Martin did his best to keep focused. He also
had a lot of time to review his performance early in the season.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're a competitor and have a bad game, you just want to
get right back on the field and show you can do better than that,"
Martin said. "We didn't play well, got blown out, and as the
quarterback it kind of reflects poorly on you. So, I thought about it
a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Mike Martz has confidence that Martin can do the job. He
also noted that Martin took a shot to his knee soon after replacing
Warner against the Cowboys and had a difficult time following through
on his throws.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm excited for him now because he's going into this game
healthy," Martz said. "I'm happy for him to have this opportunity to
really exhibit what kind of quarterback he really is."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's game also represents a shot for Martin against former
Rams coach Dick Vermeil, who released him in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Martin lost out to Will Furrer in the battle for the third-string
job that year after Furrer threw a couple of touchdown passes in a
preseason game against the Cowboys.</TE>
<TE>   "We just went on performance, but I've always respected him,"
Vermeil said. "Mike respected him, and that's why he's here. He has a
nice touch on the ball and he will run the offense, and more often
than not, he won't get you beat."</TE>
<TE>   Martin said he doesn't really need extra incentive. Playing well
will do.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a bad taste in my mouth from the last game I played,"
Martin said. "That was my last real shot. That's what motivates me
more than getting back at an old coach who let me go."</TE>

<HD>Multicultural Healing</HD>
<DH>A Guide to Ethnic Spa Treatments in Los Angeles</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILLARY JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>Hillary Johnson last wrote for the magazine about
Frederick's of Hollywood.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Remember back when anything exotic and luxurious had to be French.
Spas had pink walls and Greek statues in alcoves and offered things
Vichy and Parisienne: facials, massages and whirlpool baths--the
water flecked with glitter if you were at a really classy joint.
These days, French manicures are about as exotic as French fries, and
the simple townsfolk of Beverly Hills are flocking to local spas that
offer Balinese Lulur and Ayurvedic Shirodhara treatments.</LD>
<LD>   In Bali, the Royal Lulur is a 40-day-long ceremonial treatment
originally reserved for royal brides-to-be, and involves multi-stage
rice rubs and massages with spices, yogurt and frangipani. Presumably
this long ordeal of beauty is meant to traumatize and/or hypnotize
the poor young thing into tolerating whatever royal pain-in-the-side
she's being hitched to.</LD>
<LD>   At Lulur, a spa in West Hollywood, the authenticity of the
experience is certainly open to question, and this is probably a good
thing. At the very least, your Royal Lulur will be a merciful 39 days
shorter than the real thing.</LD>
<TE>   But rather than indulging in ersatz ethnicity, you might try
venturing into some of Los Angeles' more exotic venues, to experience
some real multicultural healing at the hands of people who come
from--or at the very least have been to--the mystical lands where
hedonistic therapy is considered normal.</TE>
<TE>   If you're the kind of person who doesn't blink at using your
Thomas Guide to reach a mini-mall in Alhambra for a bowl of authentic
Vietnamese pho, then you might want to take yourself a few miles
north to experience some authentic spa treatments in equally esoteric
surroundings. Tucked next to a freeway exit in downtown Ventura is
the Lu Ross Academy, an ordinary beauty school whose students have
become the spa world's equivalent of Harvard Business School grads
under the direction and ownership of Chrys Huynh, a Vietnamese
refugee who piloted her own fishing boat out of Saigon in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   You enter Huynh's spa through a rather bleak Formica-encrusted
beauty salon where students are catering to senior citizens in for
their wash 'n' sets. But back in the treatment rooms, the atmosphere
and the service are indistinguishable from any high-end day spa.</TE>
<TE>   Huynh has developed a signature service she calls the Tibetan Eye
Treatment that is meant to reduce puffiness and rejuvenate the eye
area, but the treatment itself is a whole-body experience. First a
warm, heavy, herb-infused pillow is laid across your stomach, then
warm stones are placed on your feet. An acupressure massage of the
head, shoulders, hands and feet follows, and the face is massaged
with a jade roller. "The treatment pulls heat away from the eyes,
calms the stomach and drains the lymphatic system," Huynh says. The
only things to touch your eyes are a couple of slices of cucumber.</TE>
<TE>   Recent graduates are set to offer the Tibetan Eye Treatment at the
Beverly Hills Hotel and the Ojai Valley Inn, but why go there when
you can get it done at Lu Ross for $30, and you may even meet the
master?</TE>
<TE>   If you want an authentic Asian treatment that is obscenely
luxurious, you need go no farther than Koreatown's spas. The Aroma
Wilshire Center is a Korean American mini-metropolis, a complex with
shopping, dining and a multi-level rooftop driving range. For
$20,000, you can become a lifetime member, or for a more conservative
$35, you can get a day pass to the Aroma Spa and experience the
Korean purification ritual known as the body scrub.</TE>
<TE>   After basking in a series of tubs, pools, saunas and steam rooms
designed with the austere elegance of a stone temple, you enter into
a brightly lit white-tiled room where spry, elderly Korean women in
black lace bras and panties work over their clients' naked bodies,
vigorously slapping, pummeling and scrubbing every inch of flesh.</TE>
<TE>   If you are not shy, then the Korean body scrub as performed at
Aroma Spa is something like having every inch of your public and
private skin worried until your naked soul shines through. If you've
ever seen a mother cat lick a blind newborn kitten all over with her
80-grit sandpaper tongue, then you'll have a general idea of the
nature of this experience. It is rough and yet comforting, and leaves
you feeling as if you have just been born.</TE>
<TE>   If you've ever wondered why the Polynesian sumo wrestlers are so
much suppler yet tougher than the Japanese guys, you should pay a
visit to Wesley Sen, a practitioner of authentic Polynesian Lomi
Lomi, a form of therapeutic massage that is a carefully guarded
secret passed on from master to apprentice. Sen, who lives half the
year in Hawaii, demonstrates his art at the Burke Williams Day Spa in
Sherman Oaks, techniques he learned from his master, a round, jolly
68-year-old named Uncle Freddie, who has a velvety singing voice and
legs like tree trunks. Freddie is a crown prince of the Cook Islands,
but he chose to spent the '60s in Vegas, hanging out with Sammy Davis
Jr. and Frank Sinatra instead of assuming the throne. Now he is
working on a project to bring cellular service to Polynesia, in
addition to coaching Wesley in the art of Lomi Lomi and giving
massages to private clients. Freddie claims that he can make me an
inch taller, then he and Wesley walk up and down on my spine,
expertly kneading my muscles with their powerful toes. It's
wonderful. Brutal, but wonderful. And worth it afterward, when Uncle
Freddie shares his secret of staying in shape the Cook Islands way,
by jumping across the floor like a frog twice a day.</TE>
<TE>   By far the most ground-trembling, body-altering treatment I've
ever had is one where the practitioner never so much as laid a finger
on my person, and it comes via Africa. Traveling drummer Toby
Christensen, who books sessions locally through Yoruba House, has
developed an African-inspired technique he calls Sound Attunement
Therapy. Christensen is a handsome blond guy with surfer-dude looks,
but he has studied African drumming and shamanic healing more than a
decade, and has come up with what I can only describe as a sound-wave
body massage that is as ecstatically pleasurable as it is
therapeutic. Christensen begins a typical healing session with a
Native American hoop drum, which he plays close to your supine form.
It functions almost like a shamanic stethoscope; the reverberating
tone of the drum indicates where your problem areas may be. He stands
over you, with the base of his African djembe drum centered over your
heart, and begins to play. What follows is the most shockingly
sensual full-contact concert experience one could possibly imagine.</TE>
<TE>   Though Christensen never touches your body save with the waves of
sound emanating from his drum, the sensation is extremely physical.
The drumbeat seems to paralyze, then liquidize, then vaporize your
flesh. And then it melts your bones. Christensen carries around a
sheaf of research studies on the healing properties of sound, and
drumming in particular, especially for people suffering from chronic
illnesses, but the proof is in the experience, as you feel the song
of the djembe calling your body's rhythm to fall in step with the
soothing beat of his drum.</TE>
<TE>   The song Christensen plays for each client is unique. "Everyone
has his own rhythm, and part of my job is to find it and bring it
out," he explains. During both the sessions I had with him over a
two-day period, I experienced almost hallucinatory dreamlike imagery.
Although I initially went to Christensen mainly out of curiosity,
after each hourlong session, I walked away with a pleasant buzzing
sensation coursing through my body, a feeling that lasted literally
for days. More curious was that the muscle cramps that had been
bothering me for years had seemingly disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   So unless I'm suddenly invited to marry into the Balinese royal
family, you'll find me spending my spa dollars in the global
village's raucous marketplace, where a little sense of adventure goes
a long way, where crown princes do turn into frogs, and where miracle
cures can happen.</TE>

Breakdown."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three years ago I planned my first trip to Italy with my wife,
Alison. We would spend Christmas week in Venice, then drift northwest
through Bergamo to Milan and cross the Swiss border to the lake city
of Lugano, where my father was born and buried.</LD>
<LD>   Christmas week is an ideal time to see Venice. Because it is cold,
the city does not smell. Because there are few tourists, even the
gondoliers cease preening and relax. Slowly, the charms of a
wondrous, intricate city bob to the surface. Venice's winter
cuisine--pasta e fagioli and seafood soups--scents the chilly air.
The shop windows glow with gold and silks, fine leatherwork and
embossed paper.</LD>
<LD>   On Christmas Eve, returning from afternoon vermouths at Harry's
Bar, we stopped near the Bridge of Sighs, the famous aerial bridge
from which the condemned had their last look at freedom. At the front
of the Doge's palace, on a wide veranda 10 feet below the walkway we
were crossing, one of Venice's resident madmen was holding court.</LD>
<TE>   He was dressed as he had been for the past five days, in an
enormous black coat, which barely covered his gargantuan belly, black
boots and a fur hat. He was pacing and lecturing, and like most
Venetians, he was a gourmet. The theme for his impassioned sermon was
cheese, specifically mascarpone. As it was Christmas, he bellowed, he
wanted mascarpone. His basso profundo rolled and trembled on that
word, "mas-kahr-poh-nay." And if someone would only give him a little
money, he pleaded, he would buy some mascarpone. And then he would
take his mascarpone home and eat it with a spoon. He lifted his hat
and whirled it. "In a civilized country," the madman roared, "Tutti!
Everyone should have mascarpone for Christmas!" It was a stunning,
Orwellian performance.</TE>
<TE>   As only a few kind souls went down the steps to give him money, he
soon turned his back and stalked away, revealing a second hat hidden
behind him, stuffed with lire.</TE>
<TE>   The day after Christmas, we left for Bergamo, Milan and eventually
Lugano, where no mysteries of my father's life were recovered. The
historical registry was closed for the holidays, his lawyer had been
dead for 10 years, and the lawyer's son didn't wish to talk.</TE>
<TE>   Back at home in Los Angeles, I developed a craving for mascarpone,
which was odd because I'd never tasted that triple-cream cheese. It
was the madman's fault. He'd intoned that word with such longing and
a promise of richness, that it had to be good.</TE>
<TE>   It is. I found a recipe for budino, chocolate pudding made more
luscious with Marsala and mascarpone. With my first taste I
understood two things: Everyone should have mascarpone for Christmas,
and that the man wasn't mad at all.</TE>

whisking constantly until mixture thickens. Remove from heat and
spoon into pudding bowls, about  1/2 cup each. Chill until set. Pipe
the whipped cream on top and sprinkle with walnuts.</TE>

<LD>Perusing the collection at the Historical Glass Museum Foundation in
Redlands, you find yourself wondering if glass really is an inanimate
substance. Among the wares on view are a crystalline brilliant-cut
ice cream dish once owned by Liberace, and several mysterious-looking
vintage epergnes, each with three jack-in-the-pulpit-shaped flutes.
Guests here journey through two colorful centuries of American
glassmaking, uncovering bits of trivia from bygone eras along the
way.</LD>
<LD>   "Epergnes are just an artistic display of glass and color,"
explains Bill Summers, vice president of the Historical Glass Museum
Foundation, of the stemmed centerpieces that hold separate dishes.
"They don't serve any real purpose. Glass companies made them to show
what they were capable of creating." Every weekend, Summers or other
foundation colleagues guide visitors (some from as far away as
England and Japan) through the seven cozy rooms of the Victorian
storybook-style house. The docents readily proffer tutorials about
the products by Heisey; Fostoria; Hobbs, Brockunier &amp; Co.; and other
premier glass factories now out of business.</LD>
<TE>   Fragile deely-bobs such as sparkling glasses, jewel-toned vases
and Lilliputian spice jars glow from the lighted mahogany cabinets. A
Pyrex glass iron from World War II harks back to a time when the
country was called upon to preserve metal for the war effort. Dainty
spoons hang from an aristocratic spoon rack (circa 1884) with a tiny
crystal elephant perched on top. Additional highlights include an
entire vitrine of handsome Depression-era jadeite creations by Fenton
Art Glass and jade candleholders from 1845. "The number of collectors
has skyrocketed over the last 10 years so naturally there's an
increased demand for antique glass," says Summers, who has been
hunting translucent treasures for more than two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Although the displays change regularly, visitors can always expect
an abundance of colored glass, including a few pristine examples of
iridescent "carnival" glass (named for its onetime role as a carnie
prize) and cranberry opalescent glass (a rich ruby intertwined with a
layer of white). Good color contrast is the key to high-quality hued
glass, Summers says. "Avoid anything that doesn't have robust color.
Cranberry glass shouldn't look pink."</TE>
<TE>   Former Redlands residents and collectors Dixie and Dee Huckabee
established the foundation in 1976 to connect with other glass
enthusiasts. They presented the foundation with the century-old
Victorian that they had earlier purchased. Countless fund-raisers and
volunteer hours later, the museum opened in 1985 with additional
works donated by friends. The Huckabees have since passed the torch
to a board of directors and core members who keep the museum running
through fund-raisers, donations and loans from their personal
collections.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation meets about once a month to review finances and
administrative matters, but the gatherings usually veer into spirited
conversations about new finds or ideas for future displays. "It's so
easy to get hooked," Summers says. "Throughout school, I was never
interested in anything that had to do with history. Then I found
glass, and all of a sudden I wanted to learn everything I could about
it."</TE>

<HD>Urban Allergy</HD>
<DH>Our Hunger for 'Authentic' Los Angeles Is Nothing More Than
a Sneeze at What We Truly Are</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E.D. Maytum</AU>
<BD>E.D. Maytum's last piece for the magazine was an
interview of monologuist Spalding Gray.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Around the country this year we have seen reports of increases in
allergic reactions. Some health-care professionals offer theories of
rampant pollution, mutated bacteria and, the main protagonist in some
B-movie script, aggressive mold. Earlier this year, State Farm
Insurance stopped entertaining new California customers for
home-owner policies due to a number of unpleasant factors, including
mold.</LD>
<LD>   Other scientists, and risk-sensitive individuals, have suggested a
more startling theory. We may be more susceptible to allergies
because we have so sanitized our living environments that our
children may not be exposed to enough dirt, germs and bacteria to
build effective antibodies to fight off the negative effects of
everyday exposure to life. As any yogurt fan knows, bacteria can be a
positive. Our bodies are full of the stuff and it causes health
problems if we run short. All the antibacterial liquid hand soaps and
germ-killing aerosols aren't going to change the fact that a certain
amount of filth is a good thing.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles seems to be driving away from this truth. Instead of
tidying up a bit, we're scouring our urban landscape. Just witness
two of our city's newest experiments in radical surgery: the
developments at Hollywood &amp; Highland, and the Grove.</LD>
<TE>   At Hollywood &amp; Highland, gritty old Hollywood has been replaced by
a $615-million romanticized vision of a past that never was. The main
force behind the make-over of the neighborhood was an Angeleno named
David Malmuth. He's best known as the leader of Disney's
gentrification of New York's Times Square, and he worked for
Canadians who owned Hollywood &amp; Highland, TrizecHahn Corp. In an
interview with The Times several years ago, he summed up his plans
for the cleanup of the neighborhood: ''What we talk about in
describing our ambition here for Hollywood Boulevard is to create a
place that's authentic.''</TE>
<TE>   So visitors to the center venture into Babylon Court--featuring
two towering white elephants atop huge gray columns--which is meant
to evoke the grandeur of Hollywood past, when D.W. Griffith used
similar sets for his film ''Intolerance.'' It's an echo of an
authentically fictional movie set that never was part of the Los
Angeles landscape. It reminds me of a sidewalk sign I spotted once
outside an L.A. furniture store: Antiques Made Daily.</TE>
<TE>   Scattered along the floor of the center is ''The Road to
Hollywood,'' an artwork by Erika Rothenberg. One selection reads, ''I
came here from the Virgin Islands and got a job cleaning toilets.
Eight years later, I co-founded a grip truck service.''--Key grip.
Another entry mirrors the experience of Whoopi Goldberg: ''I was a
welfare mother who got herself together and wrote a one-woman show
that made it to Broadway.''--Movie star/TV host.</TE>
<TE>   Those are real stories, touching stories, that perhaps no one
could quarrel with--except the poor visitor who innocently parked in
the parking garage beneath, where rates are an authentic $1 for 20
minutes--a steep price for a welfare mother, toilet cleaner or
writer, for that matter.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the new center, Hollywood Boulevard is starting to look
like a version of Times Square and 42nd Street. ABC's new late-night
show hosted by Jimmy Kimmel debuts in January across the street from
Hollywood &amp; Highland. Kimmel's producers say "Hollywood will be what
New York is to the Letterman show," according to a spokesman for
Hollywood &amp; Highland. The signs and the mouth of the new subway
station evoke Manhattan rather than Los Angeles. Here the authentic
is actually something similar to other places.</TE>
<TE>   The Grove is closer to the mark. The Farmers Market at 3rd and
Fairfax has always been unique to L.A. Its worn but still charming
geriatric food hall has been one of the city's melting pots since
1934. Its patrons still include most every age, race and class in
this city--and developer Rick Caruso has preserved the market as well
as the original 19th century home of the Gilmore family, who own the
land. Even so, the old sights and smells have changed since the
$160-million outdoor shopping center opened next door.</TE>
<TE>   ''We've married something new and fresh to something old and
historic,'' he said. And he's pulled it off, in ways not even Anna
Nicole Smith could imagine.</TE>
<TE>   The Grove is a simulation of what a small town main street might
be if there were no homeless, no cars, no crime . . . well, you get
the point. It's a well-heeled small town, with an apparently robust
economy, for it is filled with expensive shops, restaurants and movie
theaters. Transportation is by foot or by a trolley designed by
George McGinnis, a monorail designer and retired Disney
''imagineer.'' You can ride it along the curved streets to your
favorite store.</TE>
<TE>   Those streets are curved for good reason, by the way. A feng shui
expert told Caruso that curves in buildings and paths help the
harmonious flow of energy more than straight lines do.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's what's missing in Los Angeles. Our streets are too
straight. They also don't have music playing out of flowerpots and
walls. Our public spaces don't have Venetian glass chandeliers, or
bellhops catering to our needs, or the magic of dancing water
fountains.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the city is gritty, organic and spontaneous. Do you feel
a sneeze coming on?</TE>

<HD>My Lunch With Dave Hickey</HD>
<DH>Sit Down. Buckle Up. The UNLV 'Genius'--the Unguided
Missile of Art and Social Criticism--Is About to Take Off. And That's
Before the Caffeine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Cheverton</AU>
<BD>Richard Cheverton's last piece for the magazine was
about photographer David Paul Bayles and his pictures of the urban
forest.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"A man's got to take a lot of punishment to write a really funny
book."--Ernest Hemingway</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   My phone rings. "Dave Hickey," the caller announces, his tone
wary. This is to be expected of an interview subject who has,
himself, done dozens of journalistic interrogations and thus knows
the tricks of the trade. With little introductory chitchat, he cuts
to the chase. "What's the spin?" he inquires. Then he quickly
supplies one: "This is probably just a lion-in-winter story," he
says. "Ever since I got the MacArthur my life has just kinda gone
to--"</LD>
<TE>   Here he uses an expletive that he knows is unprintable. The remark
is a stopper, not just because of that but because "the MacArthur" is
the fabled "genius award" offered by the John D. and Catherine T.
MacArthur Foundation to high achievers--with no strings attached and
no expectations except that the person . . . be brilliant. The
MacArthur--Hickey's 2001 award amounted to $500,000--is not generally
noted for turning one's life to dung.</TE>
<TE>   And Dave Hickey's life, at least on paper, is of the
"you-should-be-so-lucky" variety. At 63, he is indisputably one of
the country's reigning intellectual heavyweights: His books of
criticism sell well, Artspace Books of San Francisco recently
released his new book of short stories, his work has been printed in
journals from Vanity Fair to Art in America to the Village Voice, and
an art show he curated recently in Santa Fe, N.M., got glowing
reviews. In a field rife with petty snobbery and backbiting, he is a
critic's critic. The New Yorker's art critic, Peter Schjeldahl, wrote
that Hickey's books, including "The Invisible Dragon: Four Essays on
Beauty" (1993) and "Air Guitar: Essays on Art and Democracy" (1997),
"may be the most influential works of art theory and appreciation
published in the last decade. They are surely the most original."
Rock critic Robert Christgau has said, "You can make the case that
he's the best critic in America."</TE>
<TE>   As the MacArthur citation proclaims, "Hickey reveals entirely
original perspectives on contemporary art in essays that engage
academic and general audiences equally." Kudos pile on kudos, lauding
his "piercing insights" and "wisdom and unusual viewpoints." But then
the MacArthur folks sneak in a phrase that offers the first hint of
The Trouble With Dave: "Free-spirited and occasionally irreverent."</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally?</TE>
<TE>   Let's fess up here: The reason for the call to Hickey isn't only
because he's an aesthetic thinker of rare depth and complexity, but
also because his writings and public utterances are the work of a
true (and increasingly rare) American archetype--the literary
maverick. He's a latter-day Ambrose Bierce or H.L. Mencken, happily
locating the culture's hot air balloons of pomp and pretension,
political correctness and (worst of all) professionalism, then
popping those gasbags with invectives that are all the more ferocious
for being so funny. Think Mark Twain crossed with Lenny Bruce.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a downside to being the "He didn't actually say that,
did he?" guy. As the Japanese proverb goes, "The nail that sticks up
must be pounded down."</TE>
<TE>   As we are about to discover at a lunch with Mr. Hickey.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Art in Vegas is the name of your limousine driver."--Robert
Hughes</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So now we're in the unlikely hometown of one of America's leading
culture critics, scuttling across a broiling Las Vegas parking lot
toward Peppermill Restaurant, one of those Strip establishments that
looks like a throwback to the Las Vegas of Bugsy Siegel and the Rat
Pack. Glancing at it, one thinks of the word "underbelly."</TE>
<TE>   "The art crowd hangs out here," Hickey remarks as we find refuge
in the restaurant's bubble of refrigerated air. He greets the maitre
d' by name and we are instantly seated, jumping the line of wilted
tourists cluttering the lobby. It confirms Hickey's offhand remark
earlier that he's "got some juice," the catchall Vegas phrase that
means anything from "I got comped to Danny Gans" to "I beat the
indictment."</TE>
<TE>   He may be the only University of Nevada, Las Vegas professor (he's
been on the faculty since 1992) who can make that claim. Peppermill's
lounge is very "Ocean's Eleven," with every surface covered in red
velvet and the bar inlaid with flickering video poker
machines--Hickey's game of choice. He says he plays most afternoons
after he completes his 3 a.m.-to-noon writing stint.</TE>
<TE>   Why video poker?</TE>
<TE>   "Oblivion," Hickey says with a crooked grin. Then he adds that
gambling is "cheaper and not as bad for you as cocaine. The reason
it's not as bad for you is you never did a line of cocaine and had
some guy come through the door and say, 'You've just won two more
lines.' " Hickey, whose long involvement with various mood-altering
drugs has been extensively self-described, says he now confines
himself to caffeine.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that the public likes criticism only in so far as it is
a good show, which means only in so far as it is bellicose."--H.L.
Mencken</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Three things might occur to you after listening to Hickey: The
man's mind is quick, dangerous (mostly to himself) and pretty much
out of step with the political temper of art's highest precincts.
This is in keeping with his writing--from catalog essays to criticism
to "Air Guitar"--which have as their single, dyspeptic theme the
wreck and ruin of contemporary American life. It's not just art
that's screwed up--it's, well, almost everything.</TE>
<TE>   The current state of art? Hickey told a Santa Fe newspaper, "We've
been through 20 years of art and I can't remember anything." As for
museums, they're "where we keep things that don't mean anything
anymore, but we still like how they look." Nor does he cotton much to
folks who throng museums: "They derive sanctioned pleasure from an
accredited source, and this makes them feel secure." The same goes
for "art professionals, curators, museum directors and other
bureaucratic support workers . . . parading among us like little tin
saints." Hickey has characterized his academic colleagues variously
as "spiteful monks sworn to silence . . . silly, proprietary eunuchs
in some sultan's harem . . . cultural police" who have become "the
General Motors of the art world."</TE>
<TE>   Which prompts an obvious question: "In your book," I ask as Peggy
Lee croons over Peppermill's speakers, "you said you went to work at
UNLV to get the health insurance. Surely it couldn't have been that
simple."</TE>
<TE>   "No," he responds. "I like to teach. And the great tragedy of my
liking to teach is that you have to do it in a university." He
ponders this a moment and says, "I think I'm a good teacher because
I'm not parental . . . I don't do daddy, I do Uncle Buck. I do, 'Hey,
smoke this,' you know. I treat 'em like adults."</TE>
<TE>   I remind him that teaching often isn't highly valued at big-time
research universities.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately not," says Hickey. "They regard teaching today as a
form of self-realization therapy."</TE>
<TE>   "This must make for lively conversation between you and others at
the university. Are there any other people at UNLV who fall into your
camp?"</TE>
<TE>   "My wife and I . . . we're pretty much the camp. Again, I'm a very
permissive person. I don't think people should agree with me. I'm
friends with people who don't agree with me. I'm not concerned with
how it should be. I'm concerned with how it is."</TE>
<TE>   But Hickey also observes that one of the nicest things about
getting the MacArthur was "to see the looks on my colleagues' faces
when they realized that all their work to get me out of the
university was going to go for naught because of some [extremely
colorful plural expletive] in Chicago . . . ."</TE>
<TE>   Then he drops a nugget of plastique: "I was planning to quit the
university. My department was happy to have me quit. The dean of fine
arts was happy to have me quit. And when I got the MacArthur, the
president of the university wanted me to stay. So the conditions
under which I would stay were to be if I went over to the writing
department." (Jeffrey Koep, dean of UNLV's College of Fine Arts,
where Hickey held his art professorship, says later, "Well, he didn't
confide that to me . . . I hadn't heard that." As for Hickey's many
jabs at academia, Koep says, "You could be cynical about it and say,
'Dave, why are you collecting a salary from that which you criticize
and is fool enough to pay you?' On the other hand, isn't that
supposedly what academia is about? The ultimate expression of free
speech and thought?")</TE>
<TE>   So post-MacArthur, Hickey has transferred his flag to the
university's new International Institute of Modern Letters. Good
move?</TE>
<TE>   "Well, they don't hate me over there," he says.</TE>
<TE>   When I ask whether university writing programs have become a
little too precious, Hickey says, "I don't usually get along with
writers, I usually get along best with artists." Why? "Because they
do physical [stuff], you know, and American literature is not of much
interest to me right now. I never want to read another novel that
narrates some 5-year-old guy eating a bowl of Wheaties. I'm not
interested in that . . . I mean, that's most of what you read in
books."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Alone among the animals, [man] is dowered with the capacity to
invent imaginary worlds, and he is always making himself unhappy by
trying to move into them."--H.L. Mencken</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   That Hickey has had an impact on the art world is beyond dispute:
He happily characterizes himself as "bankable," to use the Hollywood
phrase. In 1999 he showed that he could move the art market when his
impassioned defense of Norman Rockwell was largely credited for
getting a show of the Saturday Evening Post artist's work moved into
higher-profile venues, where (The horror! The horror!) it promptly
set attendance records.</TE>
<TE>   It was far from the first time that he got folks upset. In
"Invisible Dragon," he dared to discuss artworks as objects of
"beauty"--and what a marvelous ruckus that word prompted. To the
reigning art establishment, the notion of "beauty" is politically
incorrect, outmoded, even dangerous. "There's a long history of that
[word] being invoked to exclude and to empower the person making the
call," says Amelia Jones, a professor of art history at UC Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   Undeterred, when Hickey curated last year's SITE Santa Fe's Fourth
International Biennial, he impudently titled the show, "Beau Monde:
Toward a Redeemed Cosmopolitanism." That's "beautiful world" for you
non-Francophones.</TE>
<TE>   To summarize Hickey's aesthetics here would be a disservice to
their range and complexity. Hickey makes few pretensions about
appealing to Mr. and Mrs. Breakfast Nook. "Doing what I do," he says,
chugging a Peppermill cappuccino, "there's not a lot to be gained by
being a public person. You know what I mean? It's important that
certain artists and certain dealers and certain writers know who I
am. Outside of that, it's not really much to my advantage."</TE>
<TE>   As for most art aficionados, they're merely "spectators." It may
be the dirtiest diss in the Hickey lexicon, for he passionately
believes that art objects aren't nearly as important as the
communities that art creates. "Because art doesn't matter," Hickey
writes. "What matters is how things look and the way we look at them
in a democracy." Works of art, he says, "are candidates, aspiring to
represent complex constituencies."</TE>
<TE>   In this sense, you might compare Hickey to a horse-racing writer
who's more concerned with racetrack touts, jockeys and stable hands
than, say, Seattle Slew. They wouldn't be there without the
horse--but then the horse is only an excuse for a hell of a show. And
Hickey loves the show.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us to Hickey's characterization of art as "a betting
sport." Alone among critics, Hickey talks about art's one taboo
subject: selling the stuff. In his book "Air Guitar," his essay
"Dealing" is a tour de force of art's dirty little mercantile
secrets, based on Hickey's experiences in the late 1960s running the
legendary A Clean Well-Lighted Place gallery in Austin, Texas (he
went on to direct New York's Reese Palley Gallery as well).</TE>
<TE>   "Money is the emblem of the risks you're willing to take to have
some say in the way things look," he writes, adding--perhaps the
deepest insult to art cognoscenti--"Art ain't rocket science."</TE>
<TE>   It all fits into Hickey's core belief: "There's no difference
between the highest art and the lowest art except for the audience it
appeals to." Then, he adds, "Bad taste is real taste, of course, and
good taste is the residue of someone else's privilege."</TE>
<TE>   He didn't say that--did he?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "There is only one justification for having sinned, and that is to
be glad of it."--H.L. Mencken</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in a sort of regrouping mode," Hickey says when asked about
his life after the award. "And I've become theatrically out of step,
thanks to the MacArthur."</TE>
<TE>   Theatrically out of step?</TE>
<TE>   "What I mean is, I was always kind of a, you know, impudent bad
boy, and it was kind of fun to have me come in and be booed. But to
have me come in as a MacArthur person and do the same thing lends it
more weight than I think people wish it to have."</TE>
<TE>   Hickey considers this a moment.</TE>
<TE>   "But maybe not," he says. "I mean, we're all just one-hit wonders.
You only write 'Daydream Believer' once or 'Sugar Sugar' . . . let me
put it like this: Whatever change I might have evoked in the art
world has already been evoked, and it hasn't been very profound. I
think that most of the influence that I've had has mostly been the
occasion for a massive counter-reaction, a closing of ranks among
those people in power--in other words, I probably made it worse. It
has not opened any doors, hasn't occasioned any offers. In fact, it's
been the reverse. It's made it very difficult to get paid. I haven't
been paid for anything I've done in Europe for two years."</TE>
<TE>   Really?</TE>
<TE>   "No, they just stopped paying me. The presumption always in the
art world is that you have money . . . because if you get paid you
can't think of yourself as a saint. And too many people in the art
world think of themselves as saints. 'Oh, we're only trying to help.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Then Hickey observes: "If I wanted to write any of the essays in
'Air Guitar' or 'Invisible Dragon' today, I couldn't because I
wouldn't have a place to publish them. Where would I do it? Couldn't
do it for Harper's--they're not liberal enough. Couldn't do it for,
you know, anyplace else--I'm not conservative enough."</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say Hickey doesn't get the word out. "I have lots of
catalog things to write and I can lecture every once in a while," he
says, adding that for a "short writer" whose work appears in
short-lived periodicals, lecturing is a way of wringing a few extra
bucks out of the material.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to be charming," Hickey says of life on the stump, "and I'm
extremely glib. And that seems to make people hesitate to attack me.
That just means that people are sullen, you know what I mean? At
universities you go in and you're talking, usually in a medium-sized
auditorium. Kids are up front, the faculty's along the back row. As
you're talking, you just watch the faculty filing out. So by the time
you're done, nobody's left but the one guy who's got to take you back
to the motel."</TE>
<TE>   Hickey finds this greatly amusing. And it is a funny story--the
butt of most Hickey jokes, both printed and verbal, is usually
himself. But as with most great humor, there's an undercurrent of
tragedy as well. It's damn tough being a maverick, with all those
hammers waiting to pound you down.</TE>
<TE>   To which Hickey replies: "[For] a person like myself, who is
privileged with a deep repository of I-Don't-Care, that means that I
can say and do things that need to be said and done, totally heedless
of the consequences, because I don't care. There's nothing I want to
win. So that's a privilege, and you try to take advantage of it."</TE>
<TE>   Then the self-proclaimed lion in winter puts it all into
perspective: "I've had enough adventure in my life. Once one has been
on tour with Aerosmith," here Hickey unleashes his machine-gun laugh,
"and you [have sex with] someone you saw in the movies and you sit in
a Mexican jail, what the hell else is there?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hickey on Hickey</TE>
<TE>   Although he is best known for his books of criticism, Dave Hickey
also is a short-story writer of uncommon talent. His latest book,
"Stardumb," came about because "a friend of mine, [the artist] John
DeFazio, wanted to do this astrology book . . . then I decided I
would write these little narratives. I did them one a day."</TE>
<TE>   The stories are exquisite. In their precision, deadpan humor and
elevation of the commonplace into art, they bring to mind writers
such as Raymond Carver, John O'Hara and, even, Hemingway. The stories
revolve around the art world--dealers, artists on the make, writers,
patrons. No one's hands are entirely clean.</TE>
<TE>   "Some are me," Hickey says. "Some are other people." Then the
critic reemerges: "They're not polished . . . they don't kind of
bang! the way they should--but they get better as you go through the
book, as I kind of got the hang of it."</TE>

<TE>   Hickey on Everything Else</TE>
<TE>   "There's no difference between the highest art and the lowest art,
except for the audience it appeals to. I have never seen more art and
craft and thought and gift and talent and learning go into anything
as watching Allen Toussaint produce a Meters record in New Orleans.
That was real art."</TE>
<TE>   "[In] the 20th century, that's all there is: jazz and rock 'n'
roll. The rest is just term papers and advertising."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care anything about church. I hold this sort of 'electric
meat' theory of the human condition and I am as spiritual as snot."</TE>
<TE>   "I have gradually come to distrust the very idea of high art in a
democracy."</TE>
<TE>   "People despise critics because people despise weakness, and
criticism is the weakest thing you can do in writing."</TE>

<HD>Setting Sail</HD>
<DH>An Architect Creates a Nautically Inspired House in Pacific
Palisades</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL WEBB</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 3,200-square-foot house that architect Stephen Kanner designed
for his family is securely anchored to a hillside in Pacific
Palisades, but it looks as though it's ready to set sail. Nautical
touches such as a tilted frame that looks like a ship's bow, the
portholes in the blue mosaic stair tower and the crossed steel rods
providing structural support evoke a feeling of being at sea. The
entry lobby, with its blue terrazzo floor and railed steps, suggests
a ship's bridge. However, this is much more than a set of playful
references. Despite a tight budget and a confined site, Kanner has
created a house that maximizes space and light.</LD>
<LD>   "The only reason to move from the house we had remodeled a few
blocks away was the opportunity to build from scratch, and the site
drove the design," Kanner says. The land was no bigger than a tennis
court, and the ground dropped sharply down the hillside. His wife,
Cynthia, who heads post-production for HBO Films, loves the
small-town feel of the neighborhood, as does their 7-year-old
daughter, Caroline, whose friends live nearby.</LD>
<TE>   The Kanners decided to build along the north side of the property,
with three bedrooms extending from the garage and the living spaces
tucked below. By stacking the rooms, Kanner freed up the rest of the
lot to serve as a sun-filled patio and, thanks to expansive
double-glazed windows, gave every room abundant natural light, even
when the sea fog rolls in. There is little need for blinds, since
bamboo hedges screen out the neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   The best place to enjoy the sensation of being indoors and out at
the same time is the lofty living room, which opens up on two sides
through glass sliders to the yard. The easy flow of space around and
out to an Orr Studio water sculpture on the terrace makes the room
seem much larger than it is, and the sleek modern furniture provides
a sense of scale. There's a consistent use of inexpensive,
hard-wearing materials such as a polished concrete floor that
reflects the light, a pale-green mosaic wall that turns yellow where
it's illuminated by a concealed fluorescent strip, and a fir-plywood
and steel column bookshelf, which is cut away to frame the dining
area and open kitchen. Kanner also used corrugated fiberglass for
garage and closet doors, fiberboard for storage units and white
marble that proved almost as affordable as Formica for the kitchen
and bathroom counters.</TE>
<TE>   Upstairs Caroline chose the colors of her bathroom--silver mosaic
"stars" on deep blue walls. Caroline and her baby sister Charlotte's
closets, splayed to accommodate storage trolleys, jut into the
corridor leading to their parents' bedroom. The master bedroom
overlooks the space above the living room, which is sealed off by
glass to create the illusion that there is another room between this
and the tilted glass wall at the west end of the house. The master
bathroom is full of large and small portholes with pivoting windows
and two overlaid circles of mirror glass that reflect the cylindrical
shower.</TE>
<TE>   The house is typical of the pop style for which Kanner's
architectural firm has been known, but it's also a unique vision he's
created for his family. "I wouldn't design another house like this,"
Kanner says. "It's time to move on."</TE>

<DH>Ole Anthony Has Devoted His Life--and His Ministry--to
Exposing Corrupt Televangelists. But Not Everyone Agrees He's Doing
God's Work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>William Lobdell is a Times staff writer who covers
religion.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gazing down at the frail man in his bed, you think: there's no way
this can be Ole E. Anthony, scourge of the some of the world's
richest and most powerful televangelists, a man so despised that
preachers have labeled him ''Ole Antichrist.''</LD>
<LD>   The 64-year-old doesn't look like much of a threat to anyone. The
lingering effects of a near-fatal electrocution 23 years ago have
left him severely disabled and in crippling pain generated from
thousands of burned nerve endings.</LD>
<LD>   Right now, he's giving himself a shot of the painkiller Nubain in
his left thigh. Six electrodes are attached to his legs, pumping
small electrical currents through his nervous system. Tan-tinted
prescription bottles with more medicine--Nalbuphine, Zanaflex,
Acetamin, Skelaxin--sit on his bed stand. A cabinet across the room
is filled with more bottles containing vitamins, amino acids and
other concoctions. He wears a cervical collar. A walker and canes are
scattered throughout his bedroom, which is thick with the smell of
pipe tobacco and so small there's barely room for a visitor's chair.
He's largely confined to bed in his Dallas home, but Anthony remains
one of the chief threats to crooked televangelists across the
country.</LD>
<TE>   He is the founder of the Dallas-based Trinity Foundation, a group
of about 400 Christians, 100 of whom live communally in a rundown
section of the city, attempting to emulate the practices of the 1st
century church--right down to its poverty. Each Trinity employee,
including Anthony, earns $50 per week, after room and board.
Trinity's annual budget is $500,000, a sum that some of the nation's
most popular televangelists routinely raise in a single day.
Foundation members hold Bible studies and church services in their
houses and apartments and run a small school and a restaurant serving
hearty dinners for $3. The organization's primary mission is to house
the homeless, not in specially dedicated shelters, but in the
bedrooms and living rooms of Trinity members.</TE>
<TE>   And that is how Anthony came to oversee a national spy operation
dedicated to rooting out fraud and excess among some of America's
biggest TV pastors. Many of the destitute who took refugee at Trinity
told him that they had given their last dollars to TV pastors who had
promised the gullible and often desperate believers a huge return on
their faith-inspired giving. It's called the Prosperity Gospel, and
it's preached often over the airwaves.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's a perverted theology that tells people they'll get a return
on their investment,'' Anthony says. ''They're told they'll get a
hundredfold blessing for their money. They are told to write hot
checks, take out loans. These televangelists have got to know what
they're doing.''</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, Anthony launched his own war on dishonest religious
broadcasters, using the skills he learned as an intelligence
operative with the U.S. Air Force to ferret out corruption. ''I do
enjoy the hunt,'' he says. ''But I'd much rather be out of a job.''</TE>
<TE>   For now, he and his half-dozen investigators soldier on in a
target-rich environment: the unregulated industry of televangelism is
estimated to generate at least $1 billion through its roughly 2,000
electronic preachers, including 80 nationally syndicated television
pastors. Trinity's forces dig through trash bins, search computer
databases and go undercover with hidden cameras. Their victim's
hotline turns up informants, victims and new scams. They enlist
double agents in their fight. And they provide their research to
academics, fellow watchdog groups, government agencies and the media,
including The Times.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, Anthony went undercover with a hidden camera to expose
the operations of Robert Tilton, a televangelist now based in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., and who at the height of his success took in more
than $80 million annually and appeared in every television market in
the U.S., sometimes as many as six times a day. Anthony says he posed
as himself, president of the Trinity Foundation, a religious
organization. And he said he was interested in using direct mail. His
video documented Tilton's well-oiled direct-mail operation that
helped bring in an estimated $380,000 a day to Tilton.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the investigation focused on how the mail was processed:
Trinity alleged that Tilton's organization put checks and cash in one
pile and dumped the accompanying prayer requests into the trash--an
accusation still hotly disputed by Tilton supporters. The video and
documents obtained by Trinity became the basis of an ABC "PrimeTime
Live" expose by Diane Sawyer that ultimately crippled Tilton's huge
ministry along with two other televangelists. One of them, W.V.
Grant, then based in Dallas, spent 16 months in jail for tax fraud
after Trinity's investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony's operatives struck dumpster pay dirt five years ago in
south Florida when they found a travel itinerary for Benny Hinn, the
Trinity Broadcasting Network's superstar faith healer who has filled
sports arenas with ailing believers seeking miracles cures. Hinn's
itinerary included first-class tickets on the Concorde from New York
to London ($8,850 each) and reservations for presidential suites at
pricey European hotels ($2,200 a night). A news story, including
footage of Hinn and his associates boarding the jet, ran on CNN's
"Impact." In addition, property records and videos supplied by
Trinity investigators led to CNN and Dallas Morning News coverage of
another Hinn controversy: fund-raising for a $30-million healing
center in Dallas that has yet to be built.</TE>
<TE>   Hinn and other pastors ask viewers to send in donations for both
specific projects and for general expansion of the television
ministry. Donors aren't told of the opulent lifestyles led by some of
the televangelists, but that fact isn't too much of a secret
either--perhaps because it fits nicely with the message of the
Prosperity Gospel they are spreading. A quick computer search of
homes owned by Trinity Broadcasting Network, for example, reveals 17
residences in Orange County alone, including two hilltop mansions in
a gated Newport Beach community.</TE>
<TE>   ''These people are putting this . . . this . . . slime on Christ,"
says Harry Guetzlaff, a 58-year-old Trinity investigator. But the
targets of Trinity's investigations say it's Anthony who is the
blasphemer.</TE>
<TE>   ''Whatever pluses there might be, the minuses cancel him out,''
says Dennis G. Brewer Sr., a Texas attorney who represents numerous
televangelists and has tangled with Anthony. ''He's a liability to
the Body of Christ.''</TE>
<TE>   Similar comments were uttered nearly 50 years ago in Wickenburg,
Ariz., during Ole Anthony's teenage years. By his own accounts, he
had a normal childhood until age 16, ''when something snapped'' and
he became the small town's most notorious juvenile delinquent. He let
his red hair and beard grow long, drank heavily, took drugs and
boosted cars. One Easter morning, he got up early and drove his '47
Packard to a natural desert amphitheater where the town's sunrise
service was to take place. He poured gasoline on the huge wooden
cross that rose from the desert floor and torched it.</TE>
<TE>   ''It made national news,'' he says. ''Everyone thought the
communists did it.'' Eventually, Anthony was arrested for the act of
vandalism. A sheriff's deputy told his mother, ''Edna, the boy's gone
too far this time.''</TE>
<TE>   He was given an option: three years in prison or three years of
military service. He joined the Air Force and learned to install and
monitor devices that detected nuclear tests behind the Iron and
Bamboo curtains, according to Capt. William D. Ballard, his
commanding officer. After his discharge, he continued the
intelligence work as a contract employee until 1968.</TE>
<TE>   With his sharp mind and intense personality, Anthony transitioned
smoothly into the booming Dallas business world, where he worked as a
fund-raising specialist for a variety of big-ticket projects,
including ski resorts, casinos, movies, even a religious television
station. He worked closely with a number of politicians and now calls
many of the shady deals ''probably illegal. Thank God the statute of
limitations has passed.''</TE>
<TE>   Despite outward success, Anthony felt inwardly bankrupt until he
heard a talk by an evangelical author.</TE>
<TE>   ''The words that really got to me were: 'You were meant to be a
failure. That is the only way God can use you. Look around you with
honest eyes. Don't you see that all human effort is futile, empty and
vain? All that is necessary for you is: Abandon yourself, pick up
your cross and follow Him.' '' So Ole Anthony closed his eyes and
prayed.</TE>
<TE>   He has trouble explaining exactly what happened next, though he's
sure it was a personal encounter with Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   ''I left time. Boom! I could have been gone 10 seconds or 10,000
years. There's nothing to compare it with.'' Anthony says he felt
perfect love, peace, joy and acceptance. His heart's every desire was
fulfilled. He later tried to describe the feeling to a caller on a
Christian radio station.</TE>
<TE>   ''Lady, have you ever had an orgasm?'' he asked. ''This was a
thousand times better.''</TE>
<TE>   He walked away from his business and said goodbye to dumbfounded
friends. His plan was to surrender completely and wait for God to
reveal the next step. He said his new faith was tested when he soon
found himself homeless. For a while, he worked at a Christian TV
station raising money on air--he smiles at the irony. "I would even
cry on demand," he says. But the station was sold and everyone was
let go. Anthony started living under a bridge in West Dallas. Huddled
around the flames that leapt from a 55-gallon drum on a cold spring
night, Anthony began to doubt his encounter with God. Maybe he had
gotten the message mixed up. So he prayed again: ''Did I not hear you
correctly?''</TE>
<TE>   He says he heard God's voice again:</TE>
<TE>   ''Your warfare is over, so take your eyes off yourself. Let me
have the joy of making you what I want. I will supply your every need
with no effort on your part. I love you.'' For Anthony, that settled
it. ''I really, really understood.''</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, Anthony and a small group of like-minded believers
started the Trinity Foundation, which was not named after the Father,
Son and Holy Spirit, but for the first nuclear bomb that was
detonated in New Mexico in 1945.</TE>
<TE>   During his career in military intelligence, Anthony observed the
explosion of a hydrogen bomb in the South Pacific. The 9-megaton
blast obliterated a sizable island. ''It just vaporized it. And
that's what God did to me. He just blew away every value system. If
you understand that God wants complete surrender from you, it's like
an atomic bomb going off in your head.'' (Critics say Anthony founded
Trinity and decided to live in poverty only because he had failed at
everything else. ''He tried a lot of things and just didn't do well
at any of them,'' says Brewer.)</TE>
<TE>   Anthony and other members set up a system of biblically based
checks and balances that include vows of poverty and a requirement
that the group must unanimously agree on major decisions. ''We don't
do anything by merely majority rule,'' says Gary Buckner, a former
homeless client of Trinity who now owns the turn-of-the-century,
two-story home that houses the nonprofit's main office. ''It's
whether we can all come to an agreement. If not, we'll drop it and
take it up later. Some issues take quite a while to get to the bottom
of.''</TE>
<TE>   The group's communal life has been criticized for its
heavy-handedness, including Trinity's former practice of putting
members on ''the hot seat,'' where they publicly reveal their deepest
faults and secrets to the members. "It could get pretty intense,''
admits Pete Evans, a longtime member who said the sessions stopped
mostly because of Anthony's failing health. ''We want to see
ourselves as God sees us: stripped down and naked with whatever sins
we've got laid on the table. That honesty is what knitted us close
together.''</TE>
<TE>   Anthony's pain also brought the community closer because members
have served him as amateur nurses and have seen his suffering on a
daily basis for more than 20 years. In 1979, Anthony was working out
at a local gym and sat in a steam room afterward. Workers had left
electrical wires exposed, and his left foot touched them. Anthony
estimates the jolt pinned him to the wall for six minutes before a
worker discovered him, took a wooden broom and knocked the wires
away.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony believes his suffering is what keeps him and his
organization humble and obedient. ''The accident happened in the
middle of all kinds of big projects I had planned,'' he says. ''This
brought me back to reality. God isn't interested in my big, scary
talents and projects. Obedience is how you know the heart of God.''</TE>
<TE>   Anthony's skills at uncovering the financial and moral failings of
televangelists are praised by admirers and have earned a grudging
respect among his critics. ''He's ruthless in his pursuit of the
truth,'' says Stephen Winzenburg, who studies televangelists as a
professor at Grand View College in Des Moines. ''If you're not
telling the truth, he's going to catch you. His operation is really
impressive, especially when you consider what he's up against.''</TE>
<TE>   Says J. Lee Grady, editor of Charisma, a conservative Christian
magazine that covers televangelists: ''[Anthony] is a very complex
man. Most of our readers don't know about his faith. They think he's
out to get every televangelist. I know he's sickened by a lot of the
excess. I don't blame him for that.''</TE>
<TE>   But critics ask if Trinity's stealth methods used in its
undercover work reflect the Christian principles that Anthony says he
tries to live by. J.C. Joyce, a Tulsa, Okla., attorney who
represented Tilton, says Anthony has admitted under oath that he had
made false statements during his covert investigations and ''would do
anything'' to get televangelists. Joyce cites an instance when he
says Anthony posed as a pastor interested in learning about
sophisticated fund-raising techniques so that he could gain access,
with a hidden camera, to a direct-mail company that Tilton had used.
''I just don't have any great use for anybody who doesn't live or die
by the truth,'' Joyce says. ''For [Anthony], the end justifies the
means.''</TE>
<TE>   Anthony responds by saying he only played himself, the head of a
large religious nonprofit, and that the Trinity Foundation at the
time was interested in using direct mail. He maintains he has lied
only once during his investigations: When he was caught in a trash
bin outside a bank in Muskogee, Okla., and told security guards that
he was looking for aluminum cans.</TE>
<TE>   But he also contends that the Bible is full of stories about
people of God who use covert means "to free people from tyranny": the
prostitute Rahab hiding Israelite spies in her Jericho home and then
lying to authorities to cover for them; Jael offering to hide the
Canaanite general Sisera in her tent and, when he fell asleep,
pounding a tent peg through his head; and Esther tricking the
arrogant and corrupt Haman by throwing a feast in his honor, an event
that led to his hanging.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, [we're] not out to kill anyone," Anthony writes in a
Trinity Foundation brochure. "But in this instance we hope the use of
a concealed camera, by bringing hidden things to light, will be just
as effective . . . in freeing God's people from ministries growing
fat off their [donations]."</TE>
<TE>   Pete Evans, a slight, bespectacled 47-year-old with graying hair
and a boyish face, looks more like a graduate student than one of
Trinity's best investigators. These attributes have helped him slip
unnoticed inside a number of televangelists' organizations. ''We're
looking for the 'smell factor,' '' Evans says. ''We looking for
connections to different corporations, financial documents that
indicate fraud, potential informants and any indication of immoral
activity.''</TE>
<TE>   He has worked undercover as a printer with Benny Hinn Ministries
in Florida, and he lived for more than four months among followers of
the Word of Faith Fellowship in South Carolina. During that
assignment, he carried a hidden video camera and taped disturbing
scenes of church elders trying to ''scream the devil'' out of
children. The footage ran on "Inside Edition."</TE>
<TE>   ''It turns my stomach to witness those things,'' he says, ''but it
does create a desire within me to expose what's going on.''</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Evans is semiretired from undercover work. ''It used
to be pretty easy, but it's getting harder,'' he says. ''People are
starting to know who I am.'' The more security-conscious
televangelists now run background checks on potential employees and
volunteers and have tightened access to sensitive areas.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Trinity's work is less glamorous than Evans' undercover
operations. Members get tips from informants and disgruntled
employees who often call the nonprofit's (800) 229-VICTIM hotline.
They track televangelists' assets and companies through Internet
database searches that include family members and known associates.
And they watch thousands of hours of the televangelists' broadcasts,
which frequently reveal nuggets of information.</TE>
<TE>   ''These people like to brag,'' Anthony says. ''Their egos are so
big that they can't help it.''</TE>
<TE>   The most productive investigative work is frequently the dirtiest:
making ''trash runs'' behind the televangelists' headquarters, their
banks, accountants' and attorneys' offices, direct-mail houses and
homes. (Trash is public property, though going through dumpsters on
private property is trespassing. )</TE>
<TE>   Under the cover of night, Anthony's troops will jump into trash
bins wearing latex gloves and sort through spoiled food, leaky soda
cans and soggy coffee grounds in search of pay dirt: a memo, minutes
of a meeting, a bank statement, an airline ticket, a staff roster.
Those scraps of information, collected over years, can piece together
a bigger story.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the rewards are unexpected. Digging through
televangelist W.V. Grant's trash, Trinity sleuths found photos of the
pastor naked and published one in the centerfold of their satirical
magazine, ''The Door.'' But the productivity of the trash runs has
dropped dramatically in recent years as shredders and locked trash
bins have become in vogue among televangelists.</TE>
<TE>   Some ministers have gone on the offensive, sending investigators
to find damaging information about Trinity. Some have filed suits
against Trinity, but none have been successful. Anthony says he takes
delight in the scrutiny. He's proud that many of Trinity's members
have had drug and alcohol problems and spent time in jail. ''My God,
they have more felons per capita than Huntsville!'' one televangelist
was reported to have said after seeing an investigator's report.</TE>
<TE>   ''They don't understand me at all,'' Anthony says. ''One of their
investigators is a double agent for me right now. And I hope you
print that, so they'll all be wondering if that's their guy.''</TE>
<TE>   Those who have tangled with Trinity during the past decade say the
organization's best days are behind it, especially with Anthony's
health in decline. They point to the lack of blockbuster
investigations since the mid-1990s. ''I believe in my heart that he's
like salt that has lost its flavor,'' Brewer says. ''I just think Ole
has lost his touch.''</TE>
<TE>   Anthony chuckles at the notion, contending that his group is
involved in more investigations than ever, though much of the work
appears uncredited in the national and foreign media. ''If they think
I've lost it, just wait.''</TE>

<DH>L.A.'s Working-Class Strugglers Come in All Colors</DH>

<LD>You never can tell who might be living in a garage. Take the
lower-income communities of Maywood, Bell Gardens, South Gate and
other crowded suburbs southeast of downtown. As the 20th century
ended, the Southeast cities drew their share of alarums over what
were seen as burgeoning social problems for Los Angeles. Ilustrative
sample: ''We have a tremendous number of garages being converted to
illegal homes; laundry rooms turned into sleeping rooms; we have even
found tents pitched in yards,'' the city manager of Maywood said
after the 1990 census logged an influx of Latino immigrant residents
to the area.</LD>
<LD>   Welcome to the barrios of the 21st century? Try white suburbia,
circa 1930. In ''My Blue Heaven,'' recently published by the
University of Chicago Press, Becky M. Nicolaides, a UC San Diego
historian, suggests that subsistence living in Southeast L.A. is a
case of deja vu, right down to the tents and garage shelters.</LD>
<LD>   Nicolaides' chronicle of working-class white Southeast L.A. from
1920 to 1965 is exhaustive scholarship, with the attendant charts,
maps, footnotes and academic turns of phrase. But it's also history
as tragic drama. America's strugglers often face off across a racial
dividing line, and Southern California was no exception.</LD>
<TE>   Focusing on South Gate, Nicolaides, raised in South Pasadena,
mined phone books, census data, City Council minutes and other
sources to document a poor white Los Angeles now all but forgotten.
During the '20s and '30s, South Gate and its neighbors may have been
suburban, but this was suburbia a la Tobacco Row. Many settlers were
fleeing the Dust Bowl region or the rural South. Residents raised
animals for food, kept vegetable gardens and lived in tents and
garages while building their own jerry-built ramshackle houses.</TE>
<TE>   It's a picture that recalls the quasi-rural Watts of Walter
Mosley's Easy Rawlins mystery novels, and that's precisely the point.
"Blacks and Mexicans were pretty much trying to do the same thing,"
says Nicolaides, an associate professor of history and urban studies
and planning who began the project as a PhD candidate during the
early '90s. "Everybody was doing pretty badly in those interwar
years."</TE>
<TE>   But to the economic refugees in white Southeast L.A.,
homeownership--underwritten by federal programs and union jobs in
booming industries such as General Motors and Firestone Tire--was the
ticket to the middle-class good life. In the flush postwar years,
South Gate's chicken coops gave way to landscaping, and
contractor-built tract homes replaced its shanty houses. Prosperity
blurred the line between working and middle class. South Gate and its
neighbors began to look like their more upmarket cousins Lakewood and
Glendale. They built baseball parks, joined civic booster clubs and
took family excursions to Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   ''My Blue Heaven's'' dominant theme is not suburban rhapsody,
however, but a grimmer counterpoint of deteriorating race relations.
While segregation prevailed in public schools, redlining shut
nonwhites out of federal mortgage programs that gave white cities
rising property values and an expanded tax base.</TE>
<TE>   But in the skewed mind-set of working-class whites, the tract
homes and parks were threatened by those from the ''wrong'' side of
Alameda Street, then a racial dividing line in Los Angeles.
Nicolaides documents successive attempts to keep working-class L.A.
segregated through restrictive covenants, anti-integration campaigns
and initiatives such as Proposition 14, a 1964 measure to overturn
California's equal housing laws. Nixon's "silent majority" came of
age, white Democrats began to vote Republican, and ''white flight''
became a familiar occurrence.</TE>
<TE>   The sad irony was that poor Angelenos of all colors were in
similar straits before the postwar windfalls favoring whites--and
that lost puzzle piece may be ''My Blue Heaven's'' offering to L.A.
history. ''We can't just be pointing the finger at groups we might
deem as having problems because of racial or ethnic background,''
Nicolaides says. ''These are universal struggles played out by
different groups, including whites. People in these same
[working-class] communities have the same aspirations to a better
life. It's a constant theme in the history of L.A.''</TE>

<LD>INVITED TO: "Xbox Live Takes on Hollywood," a launch party for the
online version of Microsoft's interactive Xbox video game platform,
at "Peek" (a.k.a. the Sunset Room).</LD>
<TE>   ODE DE JOYSTICK: "I'm about to get busy," says Donald Faison of
"Scrubs," ready to take on ToeJam &amp; Earl III: Mission to Earth, one
of many new games accessible through Microsoft's online game
platform, Xbox Live. Tonight's plan of attack in the megacorp's foray
into the online game market--get celebrities to play with your
product, add food plus drinks, and mix--has its moments. "How do you
punt? How do you punt?" wails Samuel L. Jackson, unsuccessful at
moving the virtual ball on Sega Sports' NFL 2K3, though he vows to
practice more. "I'm gonna get the online game thing going at home,"
he says. "My high-speed connection is happening this week." Around
the party space, video monitors display fish-eye views of
headset-wearing players, viz. party guests, cavorting at terminals
hooked up to the Internet. "Smile, your face might be on screen,"
read the posted signs--not that it's any big whoop to the already
televised. "I came for the free games. I have all three platforms
[that would be PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox]," says
actor-comedian David Alan Grier, obviously versed in video-game
speak. "If I were inventing a game, it would be called Hockey
Fight--just two guys with their hands on each other's jerseys
punching until their heads blow up."</TE>
<TE>   XX VS. XBOX: "I like old games," admits an underwhelmed Tori
Spelling. "I like Frogger. I like Ms. Pac-Man. I like Donkey Kong. I
am not a fan of the new eat 'em up, kill 'em, atomic bomb games."
Indeed, a Y chromosome seems as much of a prerequisite for the
night's revels as a quick trigger finger. "American Pie's" Shannon
Elizabeth begs off. "I can't get to the games, but he will," she
says, referring to her husband, actor Joseph D. Reitman. Come to
think of it, what's the point of throwing a party just to have people
interact via the Internet? "It's something to do instead of just
standing around. At least you get to check out some of these games,"
offers "That '70s Show" dad Kurtwood Smith, striking a pose in black
leather jacket and black jeans. Maybe that's true for the code
writers here, but who'd think a celeb's social problems could be so
acute? Certainly, Smith's close-knit cast-mates, who, as usual, have
arrived en masse, have no such concerns. "Dude, DJ AM is playing. I
got to go dance," says co-star Laura Prepon, joined by Ashton
Kutcher, Wilmer Valderrama and Danny Masterson. "We're all going to
dance."</TE>

<HD>The Whale Man</HD>
<DH>Ken Balcomb Has Spent a Lifetime Immersing Himself in the
Giant Mammals' World. Now He's Convinced Navy Sonar Is Driving Them
to Their Deaths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barry Siegel</AU>
<BD>Barry Siegel, a Times national correspondent, is the
author of "Actual Innocence" and "Lines of Defense." He last wrote
for the magazine about Waldron Island in the Pacific Northwest.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tthere it was, an apparition rising from the depths. Some 40 feet
from shore, directly in front of Ken Balcomb's doorstep in the
Bahamas, a Cuvier's beaked whale bobbed in the water. It faced the
sand, its belly stuck on the bottom, its flukes moving up and down.
Balcomb took one look and shouted for his wife. This was a whale in
trouble, but he couldn't help thinking: This was also like winning
the lottery.</LD>
<LD>   He'd spent his life studying whales, trying to envision their
impenetrable world. The shy, deep-diving beaked whales mesmerized him
most of all. They were legendary mysteries, the least known of all
the whale families, one of the least known of all mammals. Scientists
imagined them mainly from bones scattered on isolated beaches.
Balcomb often dreamed of finding even one bone. Now he had a live
beaked whale within his reach on Abaco Island.</LD>
<LD>   He had more than that: Word soon came that other whales were
beaching up and down the shores of the Bahamas. Here was an
exceptional mass stranding involving marine mammals spread across 100
miles. Too wide a range, Balcomb realized, to be a natural event. For
these whales to flee their habitat, something severe must have hit
them. An enormous wall of sonar sound, Balcomb guessed--the
ear-splitting screech of the U.S. Navy's submarine-detection system.</LD>
<TE>   He knew much about Navy sonar. Although it wasn't readily apparent
from his bushy gray beard and sockless Birkenstocks, Balcomb was an
ex-Navy pilot. For six years, he'd manned Navy listening posts,
following Soviet submarines through a worldwide network of
hydrophones. On the tense day the United States pulled out of
Vietnam, he'd tracked the Soviet fleet as it went to sea. He well
understood the need to detect silent submarines manned by rogue
nations. Yet he also well understood that marine mammals had been
dying near naval sonar exercises.</TE>
<TE>   Whales or national defense? Balcomb had no bent for addressing
such public policy issues. He shrank from current events and human
affairs, finding them too heavy, too cantankerous.</TE>
<TE>   Now, though, there was no avoiding public policy. In the sea
before him, the stranded beaked whale splashed its flukes on the
water, vainly trying to swim.</TE>
<TE>   If he witnessed a mass murder, it occurred to Balcomb, he couldn't
stand silent. Something else occurred to him: Finally, you had to
make a choice.</TE>
<TE>   Those few scientists who spend their lives watching whales often
are affected in profound ways. Some come to feel they're
eavesdropping on a grander world. Some end up believing that whales
aren't so different from us, that our bloodlines long ago were one.
Some decide that whales are among the most highly perfected forms of
life ever to dwell upon this planet.</TE>
<TE>   At times, scientists sense that the whales they're watching are
gazing back with equal curiosity and equal care not to frighten or
harm. Other times, they see great meaning in whales at play, whales
hunting, whales standing by their sick. There are stories of whales
swimming side by side with injured mates, carrying them across the
sea with their flippers. There are stories of whales bearing drowning
dogs to shore on their backs. There are stories of whales displaying
fierce intelligence, grieving for dead offspring, manipulating human
observers. The tale of the captive killer whale named Skana gets told
as often as any: After giving the right answer 2,400 times to vision
tests, Skana suddenly began giving the wrong answers. Rote
performance bored her; she was demanding something new.</TE>
<TE>   It's not hard to see why certain scientists long to follow whales
as they plunge into an utterly alien world. How unlike ours must be
their existence, they muse. What are these diving animals doing with
such large, complex, oxygen-consuming brains? Might they be using
them for something entirely different than humans do? Might they
somehow be communicating emotions directly, stripped of language?
Might they be capable of telepathy? Might they be another sentient
species, fellow citizens of a vast commonwealth?</TE>
<TE>   As it happens, Ken Balcomb squirms at such questions. He wants to
make it clear that he's not among those who study whales for the
"soul and spirit" of it all. In fact, he's wary of the "woo-woo" that
saturates much of his professional world, "the whole whale thing,"
the "soft, kind, teddy-bear view of whales." He is after data and
hard facts. A beached whale, however dismaying, offers the promise of
a fresh specimen--a chance to study and learn.</TE>
<TE>   Only reluctantly does Balcomb allow that 40 years among the whales
have, at times, left him moved and wide-eyed. Yes, he says, it is
quite something to watch closely knit matriarchal families stay
together for decades. It is quite something to see grown children
still swimming by their mother. It is quite something to see three
commingled generations diving in unison.</TE>
<TE>   It's also quite something--"pretty damned weird" is how Balcomb
puts it--to witness whales' abiding concern for human beings. Caught
one morning in deep fog off Washington state, Balcomb had to plot a
course on compass bearings across the treacherous Strait of Juan de
Fuca. He didn't relish a blind passage, but home that season was on
the other side. Ten minutes into his journey, a band of orcas, or
killer whales, converged tightly around his Boston Whaler. They
stayed with him for two hours, swimming slowly, nearly touching the
boat, guiding him until the fog cleared. They had to know he couldn't
see his way, Balcomb decided. He felt as if he were part of their
pod. What amazed him most was their acceptance of him, their lack of
malice against a member of a species that had long exploited them.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Balcomb can't help but believe that whales have
achieved a more harmonious relationship with their world than man
will ever know. Yes, he says: He would choose whales over humans, if
it came to that.</TE>
<TE>   He'd choose, for one, the scratched and bleeding whale that
drifted now in the shallows of Abaco Island, looking mystified.</TE>
<TE>   Seldom had fate beached a whale before such a knowing witness. Ken
Balcomb marveled at this living dinosaur. It was 8:15 a.m. on March
15, 2000. Southerly winds roiled the sea; blood in the water tempted
sharks.</TE>
<TE>   Balcomb waded out through a falling tide. The stranded whale had a
rotund body, 17 feet long, with a short, thick beak. It was more
brown than gray, with assorted scars and marks, probably caused by
tussles with other whales. Its skin felt smooth and cool. Its breath
smelled normal; if ill, it would have horrible halitosis. Lethargy
appeared to be its only problem. That, and the fact it pointed to
shore. This whale was seriously disoriented.</TE>
<TE>   Balcomb began trying to push it out to sea, using its dorsal fin
as a pivot in his hand. With each wave he pushed farther, but the
whale kept making big left turns, heading back to the beach. For an
hour they both persisted, turning and circling. Cheers rose from
onlookers when the whale finally swam off.</TE>
<TE>   Soon a fisherman passed by, saying there was another Cuvier's
beaked stranded at Rocky Point. Then a neighbor brought news that a
third Cuvier's had beached 400 yards to the north. Balcomb and his
helpers were able to escort one out to sea. The other sat high on the
sand. They wrapped it in wet towels, waiting for the rising tide.
Balcomb thought it looked weak as it swam off.</TE>
<TE>   Greece. That's what occurred to him. There'd been a number of
strandings near naval exercises since a new generation of sonar
emerged in 1963, but scientists had never proven a connection--the
whales always sank or decomposed before they could be examined. Of
the six multi-species mass strandings involving beaked whales, a May
1996 event in Greece's Kyparissiakos Gulf, near a NATO "acoustic
trial," had been the most closely studied. Spurred by a local
biologist's report, an international panel of experts had convened to
determine its cause. As usual, though, they had no fresh specimens;
with the tourist season starting, Greek authorities had quickly
buried the decomposing carcasses. An acoustic link, the panel
concluded, "can neither be clearly established nor eliminated."</TE>
<TE>   They needed proof this time, Balcomb realized.</TE>
<TE>   The first person he called was an old grad school classmate, Bob
Gisiner, the marine mammal program manager at the Office of Naval
Research in Washington, D.C. "Save the tapes from all the Navy's
listening stations," Balcomb urged. He also said, "I'm going to try
to get the ears out."</TE>
<TE>   Better to cut off the whole head, Gisiner advised. Cut off the
heads, put them in a freezer.</TE>
<TE>   By then, reports of strandings were coming in from around the
Bahamas, 16 in all, including one spotted dolphin, two minke whales
and 13 beaked. Balcomb had before him one of the largest
multi-species strandings ever recorded. Seven of the beached mammals
were dead or dying; the others--along with the entire local community
of 35 Cuvier's--would swim away and never be seen again.</TE>
<TE>   On the second day, Balcomb cut off a beaked whale's head. On the
third day, he cut off another. Both went into the freezer at Nancy's
Restaurant, down the road on Sandy Point. Hours later, Balcomb took
to the air in a small plane. He saw what he'd expected: U.S. Navy
warships plying the waters around the Bahamas.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the many obstacles the navy has encountered in trying to
deploy a new generation of anti-submarine sonar, Ken Balcomb is
surely the most exasperating. Although much remains in dispute about
him, it's fair to say he is not much given to the art of casual
conversation. He approaches the task of talking to people warily, as
if being pulled away from another world. It's hard for him to keep
his attention focused unless the dialogue involves topics that
consume his interest. He stays on his feet, in constant motion. His
shirt pockets bulge with disorderly clumps of notes, phone numbers
and business cards, many connected to people he can't quite place.
Days go by when he leaves phone calls and e-mail messages unanswered.
Sometimes he forgets to turn on his answering machine.</TE>
<TE>   Always, Balcomb is waiting for the whales. At his ramshackle
summer home on San Juan Island in the Pacific Northwest, his eyes fix
on the sea. When the whales arrive, he is gone, rushing for his
Boston Whaler, eager to commune among them. In his 60 years, he's
kept company more with these whales than humans. Even on land, they
fill his world. From his stereo speakers, connected to hydrophones
sunk in kelp beds outside his window, come the clicks, chirps and
whistles of passing pods. Whale bones crowd his every shelf and
counter. On the coffee table sits a beaked whale's skull; on the
piano, a killer whale's.</TE>
<TE>   Balcomb's lifework can be found downstairs in a basement office,
in notebooks full of charts and family trees. He has identified and
chronicled the evolving history of every orca that swims off the
state of Washington--80 to 100 in all. Year after year, he has
followed them in small boats, watching with binoculars, photographing
profiles of their individually distinct dorsal fins. He knows each
whale's age and health and behavior patterns. He knows each whale's
grandparents, aunts, uncles, siblings, offspring. He knows when
there's been a birth and who's the mom--a newborn swims by the eye of
its mother the first two weeks, then by her pectoral fin.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it's the mystery that most fascinates Balcomb--what can't be
known of mammals who inhabit the depths and comprehend their world
mainly through their extraordinary hearing. Here are animals whose
ancestors reversed evolution 50 million years ago, withdrawing from
land, returning to their origins in the sea. In the turbid dark,
where light travels poorly and sound easily, they adapted by altering
the way they hear. Whales typically have three times a human's
auditory nerves and one-tenth a human's optic nerves. Scientists
believe sound illuminates the opaque for them; sound lets them spread
far apart in search of food; sound connects them, converting the vast
sea to an enormous living room. Even as a youth in Sacramento, the
thought of whales called to Balcomb and wouldn't let go.</TE>
<TE>   He attended college and graduate school--UC Davis, UC Santa
Cruz--at the dawn of an era when scientists such as Jane Goodall were
forsaking labs to study chimpanzees in the wild. The notion seized
him, then deepened when he began to work at a whale research station
on the Northern California coast. He realized he didn't want to
dissect whales and study their parts under a microscope. He wanted to
observe these animals free on the open ocean.</TE>
<TE>   That meant chucking what others regarded as a recognizable plan
for life. Out went his intent to finish graduate school in zoology or
marine biology. Out also went his first wife, who thought she'd
married a budding veterinarian. When his draft board came calling he
joined the Navy, yet still he communed with marine mammals. Despite
his flight training, he found himself posted to a submarine listening
station on the Washington coast, where he detected humpback whales
singing thousands of miles away. He corralled his Navy mates,
persuading them to heed these animals. Even though vast distances
separated the humpbacks, he believed they must be hearing each other.
Why else would they be tracking each other that way? He knew they
were hearing; they had to be hearing. The listening station provided
Ken Balcomb a course in magic.</TE>
<TE>   He ended up reenlisting, and might have stayed forever in the
Navy. He left in 1975 mainly because a particular captain was making
his life miserable. Also because something in his soul had started
saying, this can't be just a hobby, I've got to follow the whales.</TE>
<TE>   Within a year he'd joined a handful of other pioneers in
identifying all the orcas off the Pacific Northwest and British
Columbia. Soon he was teaching on a research vessel, co-writing books
and launching a small museum. Later he married a Bahamian and began
alternating seasons, studying assorted marine mammals at her home on
Abaco Island, killer whales at his on San Juan.</TE>
<TE>   None of this brought in much money. Balcomb paid a price for
living outside the box. He ended up being ousted from his whale
museum by a skeptical board of directors. There were times when he
couldn't predict which of his aging cars and boats would start. There
were occasions when he ate roadkill rabbits. With little bent for
fund-raising or filling out grant proposals, he still relies on
scattered donations and payments from Earthwatch volunteers. His
Center for Whale Research, based in his San Juan home, most closely
resembles a disheveled flea market.</TE>
<TE>   He'd have it no other way. He is guided, he explains, by a lesson
learned years ago in Navy flight school: When you're up there, it's
you and the instructor, who says he's not in control, you are, and
the plane doesn't care where it goes, what it does. Same with life,
Balcomb decided. If you give up control, which most people do, well,
that's it. That's everything.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after Balcomb cut off and froze the two whales' heads,
Darlene Ketten of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution arrived in
the Bahamas. She'd been summoned by federal agencies because she was
an expert in animals' sensory systems, especially whales' ears. On
the beach, she cut into one of the heads. She saw bleeding in the
brain case and auditory canal. This wasn't typical death throes or
the result of stranding. This was unusual trauma, possibly shared by
other nearby whales.</TE>
<TE>   Ketten's hands dripped as she cut. "This tissue," she said, "is a
lot bloodier than I'd expect."</TE>
<TE>   Ken Balcomb held a videocamera to his eye, recording her every
move. His pulse quickened. Here possibly, he believed, was the first
tangible proof that sonar harmed marine mammals. Here also was his
chance to learn at the elbow of a master. He marveled at Ketten's
knowledge and ability. He saw himself as her assistant. He thought
all was "way cool."</TE>
<TE>   They were both voyeurs at heart, trying to imagine the world of
whales, but they did so in far different ways. Where Ken Balcomb
observed marine mammals at sea, Darlene Ketten studied their anatomy
in laboratories, trying to "see" whales' hearing by looking at the
design of their ears. He was driven by passion for his subjects, she
by intricate structures and the rigors of science. He had no graduate
degree; she had a master's in biological oceanography from MIT and a
doctorate in comparative anatomy from Johns Hopkins. He was
self-employed; she had joint appointments at Woods Hole and Harvard
University's medical school.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks after the Bahamas stranding, past midnight in a Boston
lab, Ketten and Balcomb again stood together. This time they were
studying a beaked whale's head on a three-dimensional CT scanner.
They both saw the same thing--pools of blood in the inner ears and
brain case. They both knew they were looking at confirmation of what
they'd seen on the Bahamas beach. Despite the late hour, Ketten felt
compelled to reach for the phone. "I figure you guys should know we
have an unusual case," she told Bob Gisiner at the Office of Naval
Research.</TE>
<TE>   Ketten, however, didn't feel ready to offer a conclusion. She
understood too well that she occupied a hot seat: Given the Navy's
presence in the Bahamas, there'd be lots of people wanting particular
answers--and right away.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of obliging them, Ketten first wanted to see the whales'
inner ears on the cellular level. No matter her expertise in forensic
radiology--if there was more definitive proof, she needed to get it.
That's what the Navy and federal agencies would expect. They'd favor
hard fact over her surest judgment.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing whales' inner ears isn't easy, though; they're protected by
some of the densest bone known. To get to them without inflicting
harm, Ketten would have to dissolve that bone gently--an 18-month
process. "You're causing me a whole lot of work," Ketten told
Balcomb.</TE>
<TE>   His eyes stayed on the image before him of bloody whales' ears.
Although Ketten's expertise fascinated him, he didn't think he needed
her wisdom to grasp the meaning of this CT scan. Blood in a whale's
ear and brain, that wasn't normal. That just wasn't normal.</TE>
<TE>   The Bahamas stranding could not have come at a worse time for the
U.S. Navy. Increasingly concerned that it couldn't detect a new
generation of nearly silent diesel-electric submarines, the Navy in
the mid-1980s had started developing a form of low-frequency active
sonar, LFA, that casts a penetrating sonic floodlight for hundreds of
miles, saturating the ocean with intense sound. From 1988 through
1994, the Navy had secretly conducted 22 tests at sea. They'd been
nearing deployment in 1995 when an obscure article in a technical
journal described details of the new system. At the same time, a few
sources began to leak information to the Natural Resources Defense
Council, an environmental advocacy group. In August 1995, the NRDC
wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Navy, asking that LFA be
submitted to federal environmental review under, among other laws,
the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy had never before felt obliged to jump through such hoops,
but it had recently lost another legal battle with this group. Their
lawyers didn't want a repeat. In July 1996, the Navy agreed to
prepare an environmental impact statement. What followed looked to
some in Washington like a paperwork drill. Eventually, the Navy asked
the National Marine Fisheries Service for an exemption from the
Marine Mammal Protection Act, allowing it to "harass" a small number
of marine mammals during LFA operation. In October 1999, the
Fisheries Service gave advance notice of a proposed rule granting the
Navy that exemption.</TE>
<TE>   It was just six months later that the 16 marine mammals stranded
themselves in the Bahamas. In the early days and weeks, the Navy
publicly denied any connection. There'd been anti-submarine warfare
exercises in the Bahamas, a spokesman acknowledged, but there was no
"evidence or scientific data" in any way linking them to "the
unfortunate demise of great mammals." A Fisheries Service preliminary
report agreed, saying it was "unable at this time to link the
biological damage to a specific source of acoustic energy or pressure
. . . . We do not know what caused the animals to strand." In a
telephone interview with reporters, Darlene Ketten said the proximity
of the stranding and Navy sonar "raises a red flag," but "I'm still
not ready to say the Navy did that."</TE>
<TE>   It felt to Ken Balcomb as if a door had slammed shut. Since his
night in Ketten's lab, he'd heard little from her or anyone else.
Despite requesting an "objective, timely and transparent" inquiry, he
could see no progress toward explanations or conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   He'd later say that he developed no dark theories from all this.
Yet he did think the Navy and Fisheries Service wanted things to move
slowly. He feared that the Bahamas stranding would get buried, that
attention would wane if reports were delayed. With appreciation, he
began to eye his videocamera. He'd taped the whale strandings; he'd
taped Darlene Ketten's necropsies on the Bahamas beach; he'd taped
the CT scans in the Boston lab. Now he was glad he had.</TE>
<TE>   In early May, eight weeks after the stranding, Balcomb flew to
Washington to appear at a press conference organized by several
environmental groups. He stopped first at the Fisheries Service's
offices in Silver Spring, Md., where an old grad-school friend, Roger
Gentry, headed the acoustical research team. They'd worked together
in the field and had stayed at each other's homes with their
families, but on this late afternoon, Gentry wasn't in sight. Balcomb
showed his videotape instead to several other Fisheries Service
officials. As Balcomb recalls it, they were "not pleased." They
wished he wouldn't participate in the press conference; they wished
he weren't there.</TE>
<TE>   He could see possible repercussions now but didn't care. He owed
it to the whales, he believed. How could he know something about
whales and not reveal it for their benefit?</TE>
<TE>   At 9:30 a.m. the next day, May 10, 2000, Balcomb stepped to the
microphone in the Zenger Room of the National Press Club. He was
dressed as usual in casual outdoor clothes. He spoke softly, with
little inflection, about "this opportunity to show you firsthand what
I saw on March 15 in the Bahamas." He called it "the most unusual
event in my life." He played his videotape and distributed copies to
reporters. "The main point of all this," he concluded, "is that these
animals for the first time were in a fresh enough state where actual
damage can be determined. And that's what's going to happen . . . .
We will be able to find out what specifically was the bullet that
came from the smoking gun."</TE>
<TE>   Balcomb had been careful to report only what he'd seen. He'd been
calm and rational. He had talked movingly about his passion for
beaked whales. Near the end of the press conference, though, he
returned to the microphone. "One more thing," he said. "I was proud
to be a military officer in defense of our country . . . . But as I
see this [LFA] system developing, I'm not even proud to be an
American, if we're going to destroy our whales and dolphins like
this."</TE>
<TE>   At the Fisheries Service, Roger Gentry couldn't help but flinch.
He appreciated his old friend, yet was wary of him. He never knew
what Ken might say or do. That made Gentry jumpy. Like Darlene
Ketten, he felt squeezed. It was up to his office to recommend
whether the Navy should get a permit for LFA.</TE>
<TE>   In early June, three weeks after the press conference, Gentry took
Balcomb aside at a joint meeting of scientists and Navy officers in
Washington, D.C. Ken was hurting himself, Gentry advised. If Ken
wanted to play a central role in the investigation, he had to "cool
the rhetoric." He had to start being "more cooperative with others on
the team."</TE>
<TE>   Balcomb never did. In the ensuing weeks and months, he kept
turning up the pressure. He posted a detailed report about the
Bahamas stranding on MARMAM, an Internet discussion group for marine
mammal biologists. He posted another on his own Web site. He wrote
letters. He sent e-mails. He sat for print and TV interviews. He
mailed copies of his videotape to members of Congress. He urged
concerned citizens to "contact your Congresspersons."</TE>
<TE>   A fundamental theme drove his insistently public message.
According to the Navy, it had been operating not LFA but older
mid-frequency sonar in the Bahamas, and at distances and sound levels
that scientists considered safe for whales. Yet these levels
obviously hadn't been safe. Balcomb thought he might know why. He
thought the sonar waves at certain frequencies might have resonated
around the whales' ears, causing tissues to tear much as a wineglass
will shatter at a particular pitch.</TE>
<TE>   If this resonance theory were true, it would apply equally to LFA
as to mid-frequency sonar. And if it weren't true, then something
happened in the Bahamas that couldn't be explained. Either way, the
Bahamas stranding raised questions about LFA by suggesting scientists
knew less than they thought about sonar's impact.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Balcomb hammered at this notion time and again. On one level
the response brought him much satisfaction, for he was being heard.
On another level, he felt great disappointment. In the aftermath of
his press conference in Washington, he began to realize that most of
his colleagues were shunning him. They did more than refuse calls and
cut him out of the loop. They railed at him and about him. It felt to
Balcomb like character assassination.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Balcomb's great transgression had been to go public. This
appalled his colleagues, for it violated their fundamental way of
doing business. To them, Balcomb had broadcast premature conclusions.
He'd also reported on Darlene Ketten's work, which he had no business
revealing. He was derailing the dispassionate scientific process,
disrupting the private back-and-forth flow of ideas. What's more, he
knew better; for all his maverick ways, Balcomb was one of them.</TE>
<TE>   Or rather, he had been one of them, until he began his campaign.
Now few wanted to work with him. Some colleagues called him a
grandstander, a loose cannon. Some began to question his motives,
asking how much news organizations had paid for his videotape. Some
questioned his qualifications, pointing out that Balcomb didn't have
a doctorate, that Balcomb wasn't a real scientist, that Balcomb had
done nothing for 40 years but photo-identify whales. Bob Gisiner at
the Office of Naval Research told him that their revered UC Santa
Cruz professor Ken Norris would be ashamed of him. Roger Gentry told
him he was just plain wrong to suspect a cover-up.</TE>
<TE>   No one expressed more dismay than Darlene Ketten. That Balcomb
publicly distributed a videotape of her at work, making preliminary
observations as she dissected, drew her wrath. She didn't appreciate
Balcomb's releasing information for her, especially while people were
clamoring from all sides. "We weren't stonewalling," she'd say later.
"People just don't realize how long it takes to get the data together
and figure out what we have."</TE>
<TE>   Balcomb's campaign finally created as much of a political problem
as a scientific one for his colleagues. Their outrage at him grew
proportionately to the pressure brought down on their shoulders. Some
10,000 letters in defense of the whales poured into Gentry's office,
many declaring that the very integrity of the oceans and the global
ecosystem was at stake. Ketten found herself obliged to give 44
briefings to Congress, the Pentagon, the State Department, the
Bahamian government and a blur of federal agencies. The Navy made
itself widely heard, both defending LFA's safety and talking of its
"immediate critical need." Calls mounted in the Defense Department
for a dilution of environmental laws affecting the military and the
seas. So did complaints--one from Assistant Secretary of the Navy
H.T. Johnson--that submitting to public environmental review was
"like giving away your war plan to the enemy."</TE>
<TE>   In such an arena, it was folly to act as if the major decisions by
federal agencies would turn on scientific data. This debate finally
was about competing public interests. Depending on perspective, the
absence of clear proof became reason either to deploy or delay LFA
sonar. The quarrel bordered on the metaphysical: In the face of
limited knowledge, do you hold back or inch forward?</TE>
<TE>   There was an even more fundamental question, rarely voiced: So
what if a few whales are harmed by sonar? Many more marine mammals
annually are hit by ships, caught in drift nets and blasted by noisy
commercial freighters. Laws exist to protect these animals, but like
most, they're open to interpretation. Even if scientists could prove
LFA harmed whales, some in the country would still find reason to
argue for its deployment. "I'm not putting my life on the line for
endangered species," one Navy commander declared before a
congressional committee. "Sonar allows us to keep our sons and
daughters out of harm's way."</TE>
<TE>   No wonder Roger Gentry felt squeezed. For 25 years before coming
to Washington, he'd devoted himself single-mindedly to an academic
study of the northern fur seal, and he looked now as if he dearly
missed those seals. "This is not the role I wanted or sought," Gentry
grumbled in the weeks before his office had to rule on the Navy's use
of LFA sonar. "I'm basically a field biologist. We're stuck in the
middle between competing forces. There's so little science. You have
to make educated choices. You can only make educated choices."</TE>
<TE>   In mid-August, 2001, Joseph S. Johnson, the Navy's LFA program
manager in the Pentagon, called Ken Balcomb at his San Juan Island
home. While shepherding the sonar system through the environmental
review process, Johnson had received a number of Balcomb's animated
written discourses. Now he wanted to meet this maverick scientist.</TE>
<TE>   Balcomb appreciated the invitation. Being shunned and denounced by
his colleagues had upset him. Being cut off from Darlene Ketten had
especially hurt.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, for all his eccentric ways, Balcomb was a social
creature. He liked attending conferences and talking to scientists.
He also liked having contact with the Navy. There'd been moments over
the years when he'd considered asking the Navy to take him back. He
thought he could help them, thought he could be part of the LFA
inquiry from the inside. Yet in recent months, the Navy had also
rebuffed him.</TE>
<TE>   Until this day. Here was Joe Johnson saying he wanted to "address
your concerns." Johnson wanted to hear Balcomb's story and explain
the Navy's. He wanted to show Balcomb that those promoting LFA sonar
weren't demons.</TE>
<TE>   So what if Johnson's true aim was to defuse a voluble critic?
Balcomb didn't care. A thought occurred to him. On Whidbey Island in
Puget Sound, not far from his home, the Navy operated a
submarine-listening station, a modern version of the type he once
manned. "If you ever get out this way," Balcomb told Johnson, "I'd
like to see the Whidbey station."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson brought Gentry with him when he came. The equation had
changed considerably by the time they arrived. It was Oct. 3,
2001--three weeks after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade
Center and Pentagon. Balcomb understood the difficulty now of arguing
for whales over national defense. Yet he did not feel inclined to
back down.</TE>
<TE>   The Whidbey Island naval base sits on a stunning spit of land some
85 miles northwest of Seattle. Dunes rise between the ocean and a
squat concrete building that's protected by cameras, guards and a
double line of barbed fencing. Balcomb, as usual, showed up wearing
jeans, a blue denim shirt and sockless Birkenstocks. Joining him, all
in coats and ties, were Gentry, Johnson and Bill Ellison, an LFA
acoustics expert. They slid driver's licenses and photo IDs under a
window, then followed a long corridor to a conference room. Balcomb
sat down across from Johnson and Gentry.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry studied his friend. Balcomb's appearance didn't surprise
him. He never dressed for anyone, never changed for people. Gentry
himself had been something of a maverick once, way anti-war. Hell,
he'd once looked like Ken. Now he worked with the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   For this, he had no apologies. To him, the Navy had acted
responsibly after the stranding. They'd taken only 13 days to provide
requested information, fast in the Washington bureaucracy. It just
didn't seem to Gentry that they'd stalled. He'd failed to convince
Balcomb of this because Ken was sitting impatiently in the Bahamas
with nothing else to do. Gentry and his colleagues had careers. They
were on the Hill, they had a thousand things going on.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Gentry had to admit, he thought Balcomb's course in life
enviable. Any scientist would love to do the Jane Goodall thing. Few
had the fortitude. It took real courage for Ken to step back and say,
I'm not going to be part of the mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Johnson began. "We want to address any concerns you have about
this system," he told Balcomb, sounding collegial. Particularly, they
wanted to talk about Balcomb's theory of resonance. On what did he
base his calculations? How did he come up with his frequencies? Why
did he think LFA would harm marine mammals?</TE>
<TE>   LFA had been Johnson's mission for more than 15 years. Some in
Washington likened his role to that of a used-car salesman, although
he insisted he was not an advocate but a "technical manager." He'd
been there from the start, an engineer focused on making it work.
He'd gone on a number of the sea tests. He'd traveled for months at a
time. He'd watched his kids grow up in spurts.</TE>
<TE>   Now he was nearing the finish line. In March, the Fisheries
Service had published a proposed rule granting the Navy an exemption.
Within weeks, the Navy and the Fisheries Service would issue their
joint report on the Bahamas stranding. It seemed to Johnson that they
had every angle covered.</TE>
<TE>   Every angle, perhaps, but Ken Balcomb. An "acoustic holocaust" is
what Balcomb had called the Bahamas stranding in a widely quoted
public letter to Johnson. "It is probable that all Cuvier's beaked
whales were killed by the sonar . . . . I cannot legally or morally
support any recommendation to deploy LFA." Balcomb's rhetoric had
echoed at three contentious public hearings that spring. In April,
there'd been a New York Times article featuring his fears about LFA.
In May, there'd been a Bahamas Journal of Science article, a
relentless account of the mass stranding by Balcomb and his wife,
Diane Claridge.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson wanted to pump this man for information; he wanted to
learn his intentions; he wanted to see if they could work together.
They began trading calculations, navigating the complicated laws of
physics. Here, by all accounts, Balcomb's difficulty with the art of
conversation showed itself vividly. He jumbled his sentences in such
a way that it sounded as if he didn't believe his own resonance
theory. Johnson began thinking he'd managed to diminish this man's
concerns. Yet they could reach no resolution. Balcomb finally turned
the conversation from science to national security. Why, he wondered,
does the military need this LFA sonar?</TE>
<TE>   Johnson offered what Balcomb would later describe as a
"non-classified briefing." There is no tape of this exchange, but
both remember Johnson talking about the threat from submarines
operated by non-allied and rogue nations. Anyone with money can build
one, Balcomb learned. Anyone can go down to "WarMart" and buy parts.
Lots of nations have done just that. After the United States and
Russia, Pakistan had the most subs, maybe two dozen, maybe 40. Korea,
Iran, China--they all had subs. You didn't even need an enemy nation.
A renegade sub captain could take out a carrier. So could terrorists.
If you lose a carrier, you have 5,000 dead.</TE>
<TE>   Balcomb found Johnson's briefing all too convincing. He knew that
in 1982, the British Royal Navy established dominance in the
Falklands with a single submarine attack that sank an Argentine
cruiser. He knew that in summer 2000, during an eight-nation Rim of
the Pacific exercise in Hawaii, an Australian sub had slipped by
defensive systems and "blown up" a U.S. carrier.</TE>
<TE>   Balcomb felt conflicted. It bothered him that people thought he
wasn't being patriotic. He knew whales might have to die during
warfare; he just didn't want them to die during training exercises.
He looked across at Johnson and Gentry. Somewhere in this building,
technicians manned a listening post. "Can I have a tour?" Balcomb
asked.</TE>
<TE>   They followed a stairway down to a basement and stepped into a
room filled with 10 computer stations. Balcomb looked around with
wonder. When they worked listening posts in the 1970s, they sat at
consoles with carbon stylus printers that traced wavy lines on smudge
paper, like the frequency bands of an electrocardiogram. He recalled
the printers' loud noise--jut, jut, jut. Here there was only silence.</TE>
<TE>   They wouldn't let him see submarine movements, so just two
monitors flickered. A pair of civilians sat at them, watching whales,
part of a cooperative project with Woods Hole. Balcomb saw bursts of
energy on their screens, dark areas on lighted backgrounds. Thirty
years ago in the Navy, he'd watched whales too, but on the sly. Now
you could find public reports about whales tracked by these listening
posts. Balcomb had been reading them in recent years with envious
interest. Born too soon, he guessed.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson and Balcomb fell to talking about the Navy. Johnson, it
emerged, had worked at listening posts too. They knew a few of the
same people.</TE>
<TE>   Balcomb thought, I could have had his job if I'd stayed in the
Navy. I could be in his shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Then it was over. The others had things to do. Balcomb wanted to
catch a ferry; Balcomb wanted to go home.</TE>
<TE>   There is no telling what public attention the Navy and Fisheries
Service's joint report on the Bahamas stranding might have garnered
if it hadn't been released 20 months after the event, in the last
days of 2001, just in time to make the New Year's Eve papers. There
were qualifications--mention of other "contributory factors" such as
the unique Bahamian topography--but there were also two unprecedented
admissions: The Navy's mid-frequency sonar caused the stranding; the
Navy acknowledged responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Never before had sonar been shown to cause fatal trauma in marine
mammals. Never before had the Navy conceded its role. The report
pointedly noted that LFA "had no involvement in this case," but by
leaving unanswered just how mid-frequency sonar harmed the whales, it
also left dangling the questions about LFA.</TE>
<TE>   Some in Washington expressed surprise, having expected more
obfuscation. Ken Balcomb felt vindicated. Nothing much had changed
since the night he stood in Darlene Ketten's Boston lab. Her whale
ears, now finally decalcified for direct study, only confirmed what
they'd seen at midnight on the CT scanner.</TE>
<TE>   It occurred even to some he'd annoyed that Balcomb had helped
bring this about, that he'd in large part made this report happen.
From the Marine Mammal Commission, a federal watchdog agency, came
now the thought that "the world needs people like Ken," that critical
events "need people with fortitude to stand up and go against the
tide." Navy Cmdr. Paul Stewart, an environmental liaison officer and
co-author with Roger Gentry of the Bahamas report, told a visitor,
"Ken is not an adversary. He's a wonderful observational biologist.
He has provided excellent data. He said what he believed. He was
trying to motivate. He definitely raised awareness. We wouldn't have
data if he hadn't cut those whale heads."</TE>
<TE>   None of this meant that others expected Balcomb to prevail in the
end. Nearly everyone believed his quest to be quixotic. Therefore,
few expressed shock when the Fisheries Service, in mid-July 2002,
granted the Navy the permit needed to implement LFA sonar. Seven dead
whales--and the amorphous prospect of more--were not likely to
handcuff the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   In Gentry's view, his agency had made not just an educated choice,
but a shaded and qualified one. The Fisheries Service permit placed
some limits on where and when the Navy could operate its sonar. It
also required the Navy to continue research on LFA's impact,
particularly on sperm and beaked whales. Gentry said he meant to look
over the Navy's shoulder, reviewing and modifying, treating LFA's
deployment as an ongoing research experiment.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't nearly good enough for opponents. In early August, a
coalition led by the Natural Resources Defense Council sued to block
LFA's use, calling both the sonar and the permit illegal. Among other
things, the council argued that the Fisheries Service had improperly
given the Navy carte blanche to operate LFA in 75% of the world's
oceans without monitoring or mitigating its full impact. Policy
choices aren't made in a vacuum, NRDC senior attorney Joel Reynolds
pointed out; they must still follow the laws of the land. Thus did a
confounding public debate swing from the scientists and rule-makers
to the lawyers and judges.</TE>
<TE>   In late September it swung again, this time into headlines, with
news that 15 beaked whales had stranded themselves in the Canary
Islands during NATO naval exercises. Echoes of the Bahamas filled the
early reports. Once more, necropsies showed ear and brain trauma
"consistent with acoustic impact." Once more, a U.S. Navy
spokesperson said "it would be inappropriate to speculate on the
cause of the stranding." Once more, assorted officials promised a
thorough investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Then came an unexpected if much-awaited voice from the courtroom.
At the end of October, U.S. Magistrate Elizabeth D. LaPorte issued a
preliminary injunction prohibiting deployment of LFA until the Navy
and environmental groups agreed on limited regions where the sonar
could be operated safely. It was only an interim decision, subject to
modification and, eventually, a full-blown federal trial. It would
restrict but not stop LFA's use for training and testing purposes. It
wouldn't apply at all in times of war or "declared heightened risk."
Yet here was one judge's opinion that the environmentalists would
likely win their lawsuit: At a minimum, she found, marine mammals
would be harassed by LFA, if not irreparably injured.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow!" Ken Balcomb proclaimed when told of the ruling. "I had not
heard."</TE>
<TE>   He tracks both lawsuits and strandings only from afar these days,
eyes on his computer monitor. He remains largely isolated. Certain
colleagues still won't return his calls. The Fisheries Service has
denied his application for funding of a network to record strandings.
His second wife has gone her own way, their relationship strained by
his extended campaign. He has not been able to get specimens or CT
scans from the Bahamas. He plays no role in the Canary Islands probe.</TE>
<TE>   His foray into the world of human affairs has been a journey of
education. With wistful wonder, he says "the whole thing is not what
you thought it was when you were growing up." Yet he also says he has
no regrets. He's pleased to have played a role in winning official
recognition that sonar harms marine mammals. He's gratified that so
many brilliant people are finally studying this matter. He's certain
that one day the world will see clearly and adjust.</TE>
<TE>   That's enough, Balcomb figures. He turns now to his boat, eager to
rejoin his whales. All he wanted, he points out, was to leave his
mark. He wanted only to say: "We were here, this was seen."</TE>

<HD>Banff's snowy serenity</HD>
<DH>Peaceful beauty and prime skiing in the splendor of the
Canadian Rockies.</DH>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Lake Louise, Canada</DL>
<LD>The ultimate in dark and stormy nights -- that's the thought I clung
to as my flight landed in Calgary, Alberta's gateway to the
Banff-Lake Louise region. I could see little but a huge black sky as
a shuttle took me through the city and toward my hotel.</LD>
<LD>   Years before, I had been to these northern reaches of the Rocky
Mountains, but it had been summertime, and Banff National Park was
overflowing with tourists and campers, many of them children. The
place seemed like a high-altitude theme park.</LD>
<LD>   Now, in March, as falling snow greased the highway and my shuttle
fishtailed, I wondered if winter was the wrong season to reacquaint
myself with the "other" Rockies. Ralph, the driver, speed-dialed the
police to ask where the snowplows were.</LD>
<TE>   The car finally slid into the driveway of the venerable Fairmont
Chateau Lake Louise. Eight stories high, almost foreboding in the
dark, dormers laden with snow, the hotel looked like a fortress. Was
my trip going to become a gothic novel? I snuggled into a big bed in
a small room, hoping for the best.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, sunlight pierced a gap in the curtains. I pushed
them aside and before me lay as perfect a winter landscape as I have
seen. There was Lake Louise, blanketed in snow, framed by mountains
whose stratified layers were outlined in white. A glacier cascaded
through two peaks. The cerulean sky did not have a cloud in it.
Perhaps my adventure was to be a magical Tolkien tale.</TE>
<TE>   Although I had come to Banff for a week to ski its three alpine
resorts -- Lake Louise, Sunshine and Norquay -- I decided the morning
was made for a quiet, reflective introduction to the Canadian
Rockies. So, rather than rush for the bus to the slopes, I made my
way through the chateau's grand lobby, which is topped by a huge
chandelier of milkmaids holding the lighting torches, to the resort's
Nordic Stop, which rents cross-country skis.</TE>
<TE>   I joined a touring group led by Dave Verhulst, a wholesome-faced
26-year-old instructor. We warmed up by skiing along practice trails
in the nearby evergreen forest. The snow was feather light. Hotel
guests who cross-country ski here, Verhulst said, include "a lot of
boomers fed up with downhill, looking for something more serene."</TE>
<TE>   We glided on tracks across the lake, then delved into the woods,
our skinny skis climbing just high enough to glimpse the sweeping
scenery. It could not have been more serene.</TE>
<TE>   The chateau commanded the head of the lake, its yellow roughcast
stucco facade bathed in sunlight. The hotel was built in 1890 to
house tourists brought by the Canadian Pacific Railroad, but it since
has undergone numerous renovations. The current architecture dates
from 1913, when the railway's architect, Walter Painter, designed
towers, windows and terraces to reflect the Palladian villa designs
of the Italian Renaissance, although the roof and dormered windows
incorporate a more traditional French style. The hotel got a
$65-million restoration and expansion in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   The chateau has been a magnet for celebrities, and Banff has long
been used as a film setting, from "Eternal Love" with John Barrymore
in 1929 to "River of No Return" with Marilyn Monroe in 1954.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, it was strictly a summer place, not expanding to become
a four-season resort until 1982. As our group skied past an immense
ice sculpture outside the hotel and went inside for lunch at the
casually elegant Fairview Dining Room, I pitied early tourists who
never experienced this grand castle in its winter incarnation.</TE>
<TE>   Sisters in the grande-dame mold</TE>
<TE>   Later I checked out the chateau's sister hotel, the 1888-built
Fairmont Banff Springs, which straddles a hillside in the town of
Banff. The hotel has 770 rooms, compared with the chateau's 487.</TE>
<TE>   Banff Springs resembles a Romanesque citadel with its dark
redbrick front, turrets and a labyrinth of rounded archways on its
lower shopping level. For me the biggest attraction was Solace, its
spa, a fabulous indoor-outdoor complex that includes a gym, massage
rooms, hot tubs and swimming pools. The best part: soaking pools fed
by the hot springs from which the hotel got its name. After a day out
in the cold, I felt deliciously decadent slipping into the waters.</TE>
<TE>   The alpine skiing in the Banff region is on a similarly grand
scale. Closest to the chateau is the Lake Louise resort, whose slopes
you can see from the hotel. At 4,200 acres, it is larger than Mammoth
Mountain, and its scenery rivals the beauty of Switzerland. Next in
size is Sunshine Village, a 30-minute bus ride from Lake Louise or
the town of Banff. Sunshine is actually three mountains connected by
a gondola and other lifts; it gets the most snow. Norquay is the
smallest and the oldest. The first ski hill was cut in 1926, though a
lift was not erected until 1948.</TE>
<TE>   Dates and statistics don't convey Banff's atmosphere, which is
more European than that of the American Rockies and yet is distinctly
Canadian. All three ski areas and the town of Banff (population
7,600) are within Banff National Park, Canada's first. The government
imposes strict limits on who can live here and what can be built.
You'll see no sprawl, no huge developments crawling up the mountains,
no trophy homes. Most visitors stay in one of the hotels or motels,
although condominium complexes also are present.</TE>
<TE>   The ski resorts lack the on-slope accommodations and integrated
villages of shops and restaurants that make places like British
Columbia's Whistler more popular. Add the weather, which gets frosty,
and one can understand why about 75% of the region's tourists visit
in spring and summer.</TE>
<TE>   But lower winter demand translates to lower prices, and the
favorable exchange rate adds even more incentive for U.S. skiers to
join weekenders from Calgary and visitors from Britain, who
constitute Banff's biggest market for longer stays.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian Rockies look and feel different. Mt. Rundle, its
erosion-carved profile looking like a giant has taken a bite out of
it, hovers over the compact little burg of Banff, bound by the
Trans-Canada Highway on the north and the Bow River on the south. The
altitude is less extreme than is typical of North America's top ski
resorts: Goat's Eye Mountain at Sunshine is 9,200 feet, Mt. Whitehorn
at Lake Louise only 8,765 -- so skiers get a Rocky Mountain high
without the headache. Because the tree line also is lower, large
swaths of the upper terrain consist of bare, open pistes like in the
Alps.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving by bus at the Lake Louise resort, I was amazed at the
attractiveness and accessibility of its base area. Buses stop outside
the Lodge of the Ten Peaks, a striking log building that houses a
rental shop, cafeteria and bar. The base lifts are a short walk away.</TE>
<TE>   On my first day, a "ski friend," as the local volunteers are
called, showed a group of us around. With two high-speed quads, a
double chair and a beginners' T-bar all climbing from the same base
region, Lake Louise can guarantee waits of 10 minutes or less. In our
case, we didn't wait at all.</TE>
<TE>   The area is so immense that the intermediate and advanced skiers
in my group spent two days on the slopes and still didn't investigate
every run. (Smart skiers often target a particular chair to take
several laps.) We headed through some easy bumps to the Larch chair
area. Tree huggers glided through glades; the rest of us warmed up on
green or blue cruisers. The Larch and Ptarmigan chairs share an entry
area, so we tried steeper glades too.</TE>
<TE>   Though it was not a powder day, snow was plentiful. The Banff ski
areas usually enjoy a long season. This year Lake Louise opened Nov.
2 and Sunshine opened Nov. 17, and neither is scheduled to close
until mid-May. Norquay is scheduled to open Friday.</TE>
<TE>   By late morning, clouds were drifting in and visibility was
supposedly poor around the region served by the Top of the World
lift, especially Louise's vast back bowls and the super-expert
Diamond Mine runs. Fat snowflakes were fluttering, and the
temperature was dropping.</TE>
<TE>   Although I didn't get too many views from the lifts, I did fall in
love with, of all things, the bus ride from Banff to Lake Louise and
Sunshine. The mountains cast their spell over the Trans-Canada
Highway. I saw a touch of Colorado's Maroon Bells, a bit of New
Zealand, a hint of the Alps in the landscape.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the ride to Norquay was a lot better than the skiing.
Norquay has been luring snow lovers to its slopes longer than almost
any other hill on the continent. Locals told me that an Austrian
guide, Conrad Kain, introduced skiing in Banff in 1909. Early ski
tourists must have been a hardy lot. Even in March, short runs were
tough, and the weather made us feel as if we were inside a Sub-Zero
freezer.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was Sunshine -- fun despite wind-swept snow squalls and
chilly temperatures. The area gets more snow than its neighbors but
is oddly configured, requiring everyone to take a big gondola from a
parking lot to the slopes. Skiers spread out over three mountains:
Goat's Eye, Lookout and Mt. Standish.</TE>
<TE>   At the common base of the latter two lies Mad Trappers Saloon.
It's a congenial old cabin with the right amount of rowdiness
(especially when the lifts close) to go with the burgers, wings and
pitchers of beer. Nearby is the rambling, newly renovated Sunshine
Inn, the region's only ski-in, ski-out hotel.</TE>
<TE>   During a break in the blowing snowfall, I realized that we were
gliding across a huge, mostly tree-free bowl with sudden turns into
precipitous chutes and near ladders. Anyone who loves the Big Burn at
Snowmass would love the runs from the top of the Continental Divide
express chair on Sunshine's Lookout Mountain. The choice of
itineraries is vast (wide or narrow, tough or easy, straight or
crooked), and the thigh-burning runs can seem to go on forever.</TE>
<TE>   During my two days at Sunshine, the resort delivered everything
but its name. Better skiers than I spun thrilling tales of their
adventures in Delirium Dive, a hair-raising plunge that requires a
hike from the top of Lookout. Delirium divers must carry avalanche
beacons and shovels. The run tests the nerve of the most fearless,
although, according to a friend, it's not as narrow as the chutes of
New Mexico's Taos or Utah's Alta.</TE>
<TE>   As one exhausted skier remarked when we got back to Banff, "I
skied Delirium once, and now I can't wait to go to sleep!"</TE>
<TE>   Reminders of the Olympics</TE>
<TE>   I also enjoyed my foray to Canmore, a world-class cross-country
area just outside the national park. Canmore's stadium-like center
oval was built for the 1988 Olympics, so, after a pleasant glide
through forests and over frozen creeks, I could swoosh into the arena
and imagine fans filling the seats, cheering and waving flags.</TE>
<TE>   When not skiing or indulging in the spa, I strolled through Banff.
It's a compact town with excellent restaurants and an international
corps of tourists. The fine Whyte Museum has items from Canadian
pioneer life along with interesting photography and cartography
exhibits.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to the exchange rate, I was able to have a bison steak
dinner for just $19 at the Maple Leaf Grill. Had I wanted to, I could
have gotten a bargain on apparel too at the Roots shop, including the
snazzy berets and other attire U.S. Olympians wore in Salt Lake City,
making this Canadian line instantly chic.</TE>
<TE>   Because I was attending a meeting at the Banff Centre, I took
advantage of the institution's lovely campus on the edge of town,
where artists, writers and people who contemplate cold climates for a
living contribute to a lively intellectual scene.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the year the center hosts colloquia, film festivals,
literary readings and musical programs. A group of colleagues and I
enjoyed an evening of short, funny documentaries threaded with a
mountain theme, as well as an evening with the author of books about
trekking through the Himalayas.</TE>
<TE>   On my final day, I skied Louise one last morning and then had
lunch at Melissa's, an unpretentious Lynx Street restaurant with
great omelets. Had I not held a ticket for a flight out of Calgary
that evening, nor been on a limited budget, I know what I would have
preferred to do: board the next bus to the Chateau Lake Louise, find
a nook under its eaves in which to hide and spend the remainder of
the snow season as a stowaway.</TE>

<HD>Going the distance in Mongolia</HD>
<DH>In the Empire of Genghis Khan: An Amazing Odyssey Through
the Lands of the Most Feared Conquerers in History, By Stanley
Stewart, The Lyons Press, $22.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Study Mongolia" has never been on any resolution list I've ever
drawn up. Yet here I sit, having just reluctantly finished Stewart's
fine book about his journey there. Now I am conversant in Mongol
history and current, as never before, on what goes on across the many
miles between Olgii and Ulan Bator. Stewart, a gifted British writer,
has taken me there, covering much of the distance on hired Mongol
horses, armed with a fancy saddle, a crazy dream and a sharp sense of
humor.</LD>
<LD>   The book's premise is fairly slight. Part of it is that Stewart,
whose previous books include tales of wanderings in China and Africa,
admires the idea of a nomad's life. He also cherishes the chance to
hang around with modern-day Mongols while so many of their cultural
traditions are still in practice, including a great deal of travel by
horse.</LD>
<LD>   The other reason for the journey is that Stewart wants to follow
the path of an underappreciated explorer, Friar William of Rubruck.
William was a Flemish Franciscan missionary who set off from Istanbul
(then Constantinople) on a journey across Asia in 1253, the year
before Marco Polo was born and less than 35 years after the death of
Genghis Khan.</LD>
<TE>   William made few converts, but he and his small party got to
Mongolia and back, covering an estimated 11,000 miles. The friar
documented it all in detail. (The only reason Polo's account is more
famous, Stewart suggests, is because he had a publisher who was
better at publicity.)</TE>
<TE>   So Stewart has several stories to tell: The history of the Mongols
(including their struggles under communism and capitalism in the last
80 years), the 13th century exploits of Friar William and, not least,
his own adventures.</TE>
<TE>   That last category includes Stewart's encounters with locals,
guides, translators, fellow travelers and several horses, and his
many meals (picture sheep parts bobbing in broth) in and around the
gers (yurts) of his Mongolian hosts. Our narrator joins wedding
parties, observes wrestling matches, disarms a gun-wielding
adolescent on a bedraggled Russian ship and approaches the mountain
of Burkhan Khaldun, where Genghis Khan is thought to be buried but
has never been found. Stewart also spends many evenings in the
company of rustic men in round tents consuming rustic alcohol. Here
he is describing his compartment companion on a
Simferopol-to-Volgograd train:</TE>
<TE>   "He slept with one eye slightly ajar. From beneath its lower lid
it followed me round the compartment. As he fell deeper into his
slumbers his limbs began to convulse, like a dog dreaming of chasing
rabbits."</TE>
<TE>   But if you're thinking this is a Bill
Bryson-riffs-on-the-hinterlands sort of book, don't. Consider this
later passage:</TE>
<TE>   "From the air, Mongolia looks like God's preliminary sketch for
Earth, not so much a country as the ingredients out of which
countries are made: grass, rock, water and wind. Undulating hills,
smooth as felt, rolled away into grassy infinities. A river spilled a
silver lacework of water across soft downs. The emptiness was
startling. Mongolia made the sky, with its baroque clouds, seem
crowded and fussy."</TE>

<TE>   Pure spectacle in ceramics</TE>
<TE>   The Art of the Islamic Tile , By Gerard Degeorge and Yves Porter,
Flammarion, $65</TE>
<TE>   Here is a marriage of bold colors, painstaking design and patterns
intricate enough to make your head swim. The authors have gathered
images from Spain, Tunisia, India and other lands with an Islamic
heritage.</TE>
<TE>   Iran and Central Asia get the longest chapter, which seems only
right: The detail and scale of those tiled walls and domes are
staggering. There's some history, along with a map and chronology in
back, but this book is about visuals.</TE>
<TE>   Photographer Degeorge, a specialist in the Islamic world, is also
trained as a civil engineer and architect.</TE>
<TE>   London for the serious tourist</TE>
<TE>   Blue Guide London, By Roger Woodley, W.W. Norton, $25.95</TE>
<TE>   The price may seem a bit steep for a paperback (especially one
with just a handful of color photos), but Blue Guides are aristocrats
in the society of travel guidebooks. While others scramble to outdo
one another with the latest restaurant and hotel listings, the Blue
Guide kisses off those subjects quickly -- just 30 pages up front in
the London book -- then charges ahead to its principal interests:
architecture and history. In fact, author Woodley is an architectural
historian, and the text is punctuated with his enthusiasms (the
Houses of Parliament and Norman Foster's curvy new City Hall, for
instance) and his complaints (on the Tower Bridge: "first-class
engineering made to look silly by its fancy dress").</TE>
<TE>   In this London guide, rewritten for its 17th edition, the series
editors seem to be spiffing up the product for slightly shorter
attention spans and perhaps younger travelers, a good sign from a
series that used to be laughably staid. If you've already sorted out
lodgings, don't need much help with restaurants and really want to
know what you're seeing, who built it and when, this is your book.</TE>

<HD>China amazes, and the journey keeps getting easier</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Arthur Frommer</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I have just returned from a trip to China, a destination that
millions of Americans will be visiting in the next decade. Your
understanding of the world is incomplete until you have made the
journey.</LD>
<LD>   This powerhouse of a nation, population 1.3 billion, shows
increasing economic strength. It is enjoying phenomenal growth in its
largely capitalist economy while maintaining the trappings of a
communist dictatorship. It also is receiving millions of tourists
from around the world and building hotels at a frantic pace.</LD>
<LD>   Visiting China is no more difficult than visiting many other
foreign destinations. Besides a visa, which the Chinese consulates
issue in five to 10 days, you proceed as you would in any other
overseas nation, passing through immigration and customs and touring
as you would in, say, Europe.</LD>
<TE>   Numerous U.S. travel specialists make the arrangements: a San
Francisco company called China Focus, (888) 688-1898, for
ultra-low-cost group tours; the New York-based Pacific Delight Tours,
(800) 221-7179, for group tours in the medium price range; and a New
Jersey company called Enterprises in China, (888) 7-BEIJING
(723-4546), for meticulously planned, custom-tailored, costlier
independent arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   China Focus deserves particular attention. From December through
March, you can enjoy 10 nights in six Chinese cities -- Shanghai,
Beijing, Suzhou, Tai-an, Jinan and Qufu -- for $999 to $1,099
(depending on date) per person, double occupancy. The price includes
round-trip air from San Francisco on Air China (there's an $80 add-on
fee for the United flight from LAX), all touring and transportation
within China, hotel accommodations each night and three meals a day.
The price is that low because it's cold in Beijing, but no colder
than in many U.S. cities, and if you pack the proper clothing you can
enjoy a comfortable stay.</TE>
<TE>   On your own independent tour of China, you'd be wise on a first
trip to limit your itinerary to three cities: Beijing, Xi'an and
Shanghai. From Beijing you visit the Great Wall, the Forbidden City,
the Summer Palace and Tiananmen Square. In Xi'an you view that
remarkable, chilling Army of the Terra Cotta Warriors from the 2nd
century BC. In Shanghai you visit the Shanghai Museum, with a
spectacular collection of artifacts, and view the city life of a
commercial powerhouse: modern shopping boulevards, traffic like that
in New York, skyscrapers and an up-to-date subway.</TE>
<TE>   In all three cities, you can find five-star hotels for $160 per
double room, comfortable four-star hotels for $120, three stars for
$70 -- and all of them will offer lower rates if you bargain after
contacting them on the Web.</TE>
<TE>   Can you really tour on your own in Shanghai? Even though the
instructions are mainly in Chinese, it isn't hard to work the ticket
dispenser in a Shanghai subway station. I recently deposited 2 yuan,
or 24 cents apiece, for my wife and me, and soon we were speeding in
a slickly modern, almost silent train to a glass-and-marble-lined
shopping center that rivaled, in contents and appearance, anything on
Rodeo Drive or Fifth Avenue. There, amid throngs of well-dressed
local shoppers, we purchased stylish cardigans for our daughters at a
quarter of the price we would have paid in the United States.</TE>

<HD>In Chamonix, skiing on the edge</HD>
<DH>In the shadow of Mont Blanc, a glacier delivers enough
thrills and dramatic scenery to carry schussers through the dog days
of summer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gerry Wingenbach</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Chamonix, France</DL>
<LD>Even in the Alps, where ski lifts as varied as the blades of a Swiss
Army knife scale mountain after mountain, the 60-passenger tram to
the Aiguille du Midi is mythical.</LD>
<LD>   It is the highest cable car in Europe, and it reveals a panorama
of France, Italy and Switzerland.</LD>
<LD>   The tram rises from Chamonix, France's original ski resort and the
site of the first Winter Olympic Games in 1924. It ends at the
Aiguille du Midi, a fortress-like granite spire that looms next to
white-domed Mont Blanc, at 15,771 feet the highest mountain in the
Alps. It covers the distance in two airy spans -- one of them the
longest of any aerial tram in the world.</LD>
<TE>   As if these superlatives weren't enough, the Aiguille du Midi also
is the departure point for the longest lift-serviced skiing and
snowboarding run in the world: the 13-mile-long Vallee Blanche (White
Valley). It is one of the most memorable day trips in the Alps.</TE>
<TE>   Last winter, on a blue-sky day, my friend Armel Faron, a veteran
Chamonix mountain guide, and I boarded the tram for the Aiguille du
Midi. I had spent much of the winter in Europe, yo-yoing up and down
the main ski runs of the Alps and searching for bedbugs between the
sheets of two-star hotels while researching a ski guidebook. Life,
even the good life of European ski-resort hopping, had become just
days on the assembly line, and I longed to get lost. Armel had a
suggestion.</TE>
<TE>   "A ski day on the Vallee Blanche is the snapshot of the Alps you
will carry in your mind all summer," he promised.</TE>
<TE>   Given the right conditions, and with an experienced mountain guide
leading the way, any intermediate-level skier or snowboarder with a
sense of adventure can cruise the Vallee Blanche's
9,200-vertical-foot drop: the equivalent of stacking Vail, Steamboat
and Stowe on top of one another. More than 2,000 skiers and boarders
descend the glacier every winter.</TE>
<TE>   The standard route to the village of Chamonix descends the
ice-jumbled Glacier du Tacul before merging with the Mer de Glace,
France's largest glacier. For much of its length it does resemble its
name, a rough sea suddenly frozen in storm. The route is littered
with crevasses. Other dangers include train-car-size seracs -- large
masses of ice isolated by intersecting crevasses -- that can shift,
tumble and crush a skier.</TE>
<TE>   From the 12,600-foot summit of the Aiguille du Midi, Armel pointed
out major climbing routes on Mont Blanc, where he spends summers
guiding clients on two-day trips to the summit. The stone overnight
shelter called the Cosmiques refuge, an hour's climb away, was in
sight. We also peered at the glaciers on the west face of Mont Blanc,
which can be skied all the way down to the glitzy Italian resort of
Courmayeur, about eight miles away.</TE>
<TE>   With skis cinched to our rucksacks, we began the roped descent of
the steep, snow-plastered arete that leads from the Aiguille du Midi
to the head wall of the Glacier du Tacul. At a level, airy perch we
stepped into our skis and descended a nicely pitched snowfield down
to the upper end of the glacier.</TE>
<TE>   Armel crafted swooping parabolas through fields of crevasses
intersected with porcelain-blue seracs. I followed in his tracks,
zigzagging and banking like a bobsledder and often slowing to cross
snow bridges so narrow that only one skier at a time could cross over
seemingly bottomless crevasses.</TE>
<TE>   After countless turns picking our way through the glacier's
obstacles with figure skaters' smiles, we sat in the snow using our
skis as a backrest. With the sun on our faces we enjoyed the
extraordinary landscape while feasting on fat baguettes and a bottle
of Cotes du Rhone red that I had stowed in my backpack. Surrounding
us were some of Europe's most imposing summits, cut against a
cloudless sky.</TE>
<TE>   The Vallee Blanche is squeezed between wedding-cake-like rock
towers that include Le Dru, La Verte and Grandes Jorasses. And on top
of the scenery is history. On these craggy granite faces Italian
Walter Bonatti and the Frenchman Gaston Rebuffat completed the first
ascents on what would become classic routes of 20th century
mountaineering.</TE>
<TE>   The final escape into the village of Chamonix is through the woods
at the bottom of the glacier. Altogether we covered 13 miles on skis.
If snow is sparse in the final stretch, skiers can bail out near the
toe of the glacier at the Montenvers ice cave, where a cogwheel train
travels back to Chamonix.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Chamonix area offers skiers and snowboarders vast
terrain beyond the Vallee Blanche. Chamonix Valley has 12 separate
ski areas with 49 lifts. The 145 marked ski trails range from
mom-and-pop cruisers to in-your-face steeps.</TE>
<TE>   Most skiers begin the day on the sunny, east-facing slopes of Le
Brevent and La Flegere, directly above Chamonix, where there are
trails suitable for all levels of skiers and snowboarders. Beginners
and intermediates can enjoy the Col de Balme area above the village
of Le Tour. Advanced skiers can head for Les Grands Montets above the
village of Argentiere. Throughout the valley much of the skiing and
boarding is for the hard core. Particularly prized are the
elevator-shaft-like couloirs, so narrow that only a sliver of
sunlight reaches the snow each day. But off trail you ski at your own
risk in areas that are neither machine groomed nor patrolled, so I
advise you to take a local guide along.</TE>
<TE>   Not only skiers but climbers and hang gliders are drawn here. The
valley's lifestyle is fueled on adrenaline, and it's been that way
since 1786, when a local hunter and a village doctor teamed up to
make the first ascent of Mont Blanc.</TE>
<TE>   An Alpine atmosphere</TE>
<TE>   The 19th century village of Chamonix is pure Alpine. Walking tours
led by Chamonix Tourist Office guides center on Chamonix's mountain
history. Also worth a stop is the Alpine Museum, with its photo
collection of early mountain guides and mountaineering equipment. The
Richard Bozon Sports Center contains a library, national school for
skiing and Alpinism, and outdoor and indoor swimming pools, as well
as a skating rink. Dog sledding also is offered in the valley.</TE>
<TE>   Savoyard-style cream-and-mustard-colored walk-ups with pitched
roofs dominate Chamonix's narrow, carless alleyways. Fresh flowers
brighten the central memorial to native sons who died in two world
wars and the French-Algerian conflict of the 1950s. At 7 p.m., when
the bells of St. Michel church ring, elderly residents make their way
up the stone steps for evening Mass.</TE>
<TE>   To make an entrance worthy of the setting, arrive from the Swiss
border town of Martigny on the narrow-gauge train called the
Mont-Blanc Express. (To call it express overstates its velocity, but
nobody should rush through country like the Chamonix Valley.)</TE>
<TE>   The valley's population of 10,000 sometimes doubles during peak
ski periods around Christmas and the last two weeks of February. But
there are plenty of accommodations. I found a fine, central one-star
place called Hotel du Louvre for about $40 a night.</TE>
<TE>   Chamonix also has a range of restaurants featuring regional
cuisine served by young Scandinavians enjoying the job-mobility
benefits of the 12-nation European Union. Perhaps the veteran French
waiters who never make a needless move have all retreated to Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Chamonix's apres-ski scene is among the liveliest in France.
Locals gather at Chambre Neuf for drinks and live music, followed by
the far-reaching dinner menu at Le Monchu. I had drinks at the richly
appointed bar of the four-star Hotel Mont-Blanc. Choucas and Dick's
Tea Bar are favorite watering holes for American and British
visitors. There's even a chic casino.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Chamonix has everything a skier needs: the best scenery in
the French Alps, huge and wild skiing, century-old tradition and
night life worthy of Aspen.</TE>
<TE>   But Armel was right. The Vallee Blanche is a place where snow and
rock and memories linger. And it was the snapshot of the Alps I
carried all summer long.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's all downhill in Alps of Chamonix</TE>
<TE>   GETTING THERE:</TE>
<TE>   From LAX, Swiss, Air France, KLM, British and Lufthansa have
connecting service (with a change of plane) to Geneva, 60 miles from
Chamonix. Restricted round-trip fares begin at $469.</TE>
<TE>   To get to Chamonix by train takes 2 1/2 hours via St. Gervais,

<HD>Slip-sliding away in regal Kings Canyon</HD>
<DH>Nordic skiers at the Montecito-Sequoia resort need not plan
for a stylish scene. Here it's all about the woods.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vani Rangachar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Sequoia National Forest, Calif.</DL>
<LD>About a week before our trip to Montecito-Sequoia Lodge, my husband
bought chains for the car, and I pulled out every item of warm
clothing we had. I thought we were prepared for whatever might happen
on a cross-country ski weekend at the edge of Sequoia and Kings
Canyon national parks.</LD>
<LD>   A letter from the lodge came four days before our departure. Along
with a liability waiver and the usual warning about the hazards of
driving and playing in the snow was a request to furnish proof of
health and accident insurance coverage. Accidents? What were we
getting into?</LD>
<LD>   I like cross-country partly because it's gentler than downhill
skiing. I've never encountered cross-country skiers careening out of
control nor suffered bodily harm other than sore muscles. The lodge's
request hinted that a bigger danger lurked among the sequoias.</LD>
<TE>   But I put on my game face, and by midafternoon on a Friday last
February, Barry and I had driven north through fallow fields lining
California 99 in the San Joaquin Valley and turned east at Visalia,
climbing toward the Sierra's 10,000-foot peaks. Just short of Sequoia
National Park's Giant Forest, we were advised to put on chains. The
road, though snow-covered and icy in places, was clear enough that we
didn't need them with our four-wheel drive. The scenery was
Christmas-card perfect, the trees weighted with snow.</TE>
<TE>   Montecito-Sequoia Winter Sports and Cross Country Ski Resort
leases 42 acres in one of California's prettiest settings, off
Generals Highway in Sequoia National Forest about five hours north of
L.A. The 13 cabins and 36 rooms are wedged near the two national
parks. The rustic resort is popular with families in summer and
Nordic skiers in winter. Other seasonal activities include snow
tubing, ice skating, snowmobiling and dog sledding.</TE>
<TE>   Our Friday-to-Sunday package included lodging, trail passes, meals
and snacks for $140 (plus tax) per person, per night. Alcoholic
beverages, gear rentals and guided activities like snowshoeing were
extra.</TE>
<TE>   When we arrived at 6:30 p.m., it was densely dark, the lodge
shrouded in snow. Following corridors dug in the white stuff,
gingerly stepping on patches of ice and skirting menacing icicle
daggers hanging from eaves, we stumbled toward a side door that put
us in a large room full of conversation and warmth from a hearth that
took up most of one wall. A near-life-size portrait of owner Virginia
Barnes watched over the bustle. This room, we would learn, is the
heart of the lodge, where guests and staff eat, mingle, snooze and
warm up.</TE>
<TE>   Hearty fare, basic lodging</TE>
<TE>   Dinner is served from 5 to 7:30 p.m., so people were lining up at
a buffet. Barry and I checked in and turned in our car keys so the
staff could move the car for the snowplows if necessary. Then we
headed for the chow line.</TE>
<TE>   I don't much like buffets. I am not a big eater, and I usually
find the fare warmed over, unhealthy and unrecognizable. This one
surprised me: moist halibut with a lemon caper sauce, a choice of
salads and sauteed string beans (not overly wrinkled) sprinkled with
almonds. The seven meals we ate there turned out to be varied, good
and filling.</TE>
<TE>   We loaded up our plates, bought a bottle of Sterling Cabernet
Sauvignon from the closet-like Pine Box bar and ate our meals on
large leather couches by the hearth.</TE>
<TE>   Fortified, we walked to our room. It was simple, with a dresser,
two beds that showed wear and two floor lamps. Extra electric
blankets -- without cords -- were on a shelf. A wall heater, although
noisy, warmed the room in minutes. The bathroom was just as spare,
with towels and two small bars of soap. There was no TV or telephone.
But it didn't matter: This wasn't the kind of place where you spend a
lot of time in your room.</TE>
<TE>   Sunlight streaming through a window woke us Saturday just in time
for breakfast, served from 8 to 9:30 a.m. The line snaked out the
double doors leading to the kitchen. Inside was a buffet of eggs,
pancakes, bacon, hot and cold cereals, fruit, yogurt -- plenty to
carbo-load for a day of strenuous activity.</TE>
<TE>   Barry went off to the resort's shop to rent skis and poles, and I
practiced my kick-glide stride with my own gear. Back together, with
maps of 50 miles of trails in our pockets, we shuffled up the hill on
the gentle, intermediate-level Sunrise Trail, which quickly took us
out of sight and sound of the lodge.</TE>
<TE>   For two hours we followed tracks bordered by sequoias and
lodgepole pines, alone but for mountains. Good thing: That meant no
witnesses to the embarrassing spills I took, especially a face-first
fall in a snowbank. (At the Travel section's press time Tuesday, the
lodge had no snow.)</TE>
<TE>   The kick-glide routine gave us an appetite for the lunch buffet of
pizza, cold cuts, cheeses, spicy black bean soup and tuna. We did
justice to the all-you-can-eat concept.</TE>
<TE>   Barry and I had signed up for a guided snowshoe trip. Snowshoeing
is no walk in the park, the gear requiring an odd shuffling step that
I found difficult. I was feeling the effects of my active morning,
and a dull headache from the altitude was kicking in. About a quarter
of the way into our trek, my steps and spirit flagging, I decided I
wasn't up to the exertion, so I turned back. Barry later said I
missed one of the weekend's best adventures: a strenuous off-trail
four-hour hike to the top of 8,209-foot Big Baldy in Kings Canyon and
a view that took in the San Joaquin Valley and Mt. Whitney.</TE>
<TE>   As I was heading to the room, I passed the outdoor hot tub, where
three women were laughing and talking. The steam rising above their
heads looked so enticing that I joined them. Sitting in the bubbles,
I lifted my eyes to the peaks of the Great Western Divide, glowing
pink in the setting sun, and thought them as divine a sight as could
be.</TE>
<TE>   While Barry was still blazing paths in the wilderness, I went
skiing on the easy, mile-long Homavalo Trail around a frozen pond.
That gave me just enough of a workout to warrant a nap -- and a snack
of a half-dozen bite-size pieces of steaming spinach pie at the
lodge.</TE>
<TE>   Relaxing by the fireplace</TE>
<TE>   Even outside of mealtimes, the lodge's large Arizona stone hearth
was a magnet. The place felt like a friend's living room, and the
atmosphere rubbed off on guests. Although most of us around the fire
did not know one another, there was none of the usual awkwardness
among strangers.</TE>
<TE>   When I stopped in midafternoon Saturday to warm up, three men were
snoozing, sprawled on the comfortable leather couches, using their
jackets as blankets. Children worked on puzzles and played board
games.</TE>
<TE>   In the evenings, mothers spun bedtime stories to toddlers, and
couples gazed reflectively at the flames. Sipping a cognac from a
brandy glass filled to the brim by a staffer, I was lulled into a
snooze by the fire. In a place as cozy and casual as this, I would
have been content to forget about skiing and spend the weekend curled
up with a book.</TE>
<TE>   But we came here to ski, so ski we did on Sunday morning before
our departure. We glided to a halt at a lookout that took in the
snow-covered Sierra. We listened and looked, enjoying the stillness
and the sun.</TE>

<HD>Home away from a posh hotel</HD>
<DH>Bringing little luxuries into your own bedroom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sophia Dembling</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The latest press release from Magellan's travel gizmo catalog
suggests items to "make your hotel room a home." To that end, it
describes a CD/MP3 clock radio, wine and coffee-for-two totes and a
travel putting set. Sure, why not?</LD>
<LD>   I've heard other tips for making hotel rooms homey: Display framed
photos of family, burn scented candles, bring your own pillowcases,
brew herbal teas. All lovely ideas I might try someday.</LD>
<LD>   But I'm more interested in ways to make my home more like a hotel
room -- a really fancy one. Don't you love them?</LD>
<TE>   Good hotel rooms are tidier and better decorated than my bedroom,
and the floors aren't littered with aromatic old dogs, as they are at
home. Hotel rooms have TVs that swivel and cable, which we haven't
gotten around to yet. (We live almost like the Amish.) One of our
favorite vacation activities is catching up on VH1's program "Behind
the Music."</TE>
<TE>   But the best part of a really good hotel room is the bed:
double-sheeted in the softest cotton, pregnant with expensive
pillows, big as a swimming pool. I want a bed like that at home. I
dream of hotel beds.</TE>
<TE>   I'm haunted by the memory of the pillows at Little Palm Island
Resort in Florida. I left without even asking their name, but it's
been four years, and I can't forget their perfect loft. When I
mention them, my husband, Tom, rolls his eyes and says, "Not the
pillows again."</TE>
<TE>   I finally called the resort to inquire, but I'm not yet satisfied.
Little Palm guests now sleep on Dream Maker pillows made by a New
Zealand company called Autex, but the resort has changed ownership
since our visit. They might have changed pillows too.</TE>
<TE>   Further research is required. As God is my witness, I'll sleep on
those pillows again.</TE>
<TE>   At Shutters on the Beach in Santa Monica, I had an epiphany about
pillow-top mattresses. Our bed was so comfortable, I peeled off the
bottom sheet to see what witchcraft lay beneath. I'd heard of
pillow-tops before, with their attached ultra-thick pads, but never
thought about them. Now I can't stop.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently this particular custom Sealy Posturepedic affects other
guests similarly, so Shutters sells it. (This is not unheard of. W
Hotels sell their guest room beds, box spring to pillowcases.) At
$1,700 for king size, it's out of our league, but the world is full
of pillow-tops, and I will have one.</TE>
<TE>   A less expensive revelation: I have long been devoted to cotton
sheets but haven't sprung for the most expensive high-thread-count
kind. However, I recently tried liquid fabric softener for the first
time (more Amishness, I guess), and my 250-thread-count sheets came
out almost as soft as if housekeeping had done them. Luxury I can
clip coupons for.</TE>
<TE>   Fine hotel bathrooms also shame our old house, but we're learning
and taking humble steps. Our suite at Little Palm had an outdoor
shower that so enchanted Tom, he rushed home and rigged one in our
backyard. It's just a garden hose with a shower nozzle hung from a
tree, but in a Texas summer, it's sweet.</TE>
<TE>   At Rough Creek Lodge in Glen Rose, Texas, the showerheads are the
size of flapjacks, and the water pressure is up to the job. I doubt
our little bathroom could handle such a showerhead, but I might try.
It was like having my own private rain shower.</TE>
<TE>   And although swiping hotel soap is a time-honored tradition, the
Forest Essentials facial and body soaps in the bathrooms at Shutters
were so luxurious, I squirreled away every bar, including our used
ones. I came home with four bars. We have one left, which I'm saving
for a special occasion. It'll cost me $8 a bar to replace when
Shutters gets its online shop running, but I'm tempted.</TE>
<TE>   To finish the picture, of course, we need "Behind the Music."</TE>
<TE>   Cable is under continual discussion in this household, if for no
other reason than peer pressure. But I'm afraid. With Little Palm
pillows, a pillow-top mattress, velvety cotton sheets, a shmancy
bathroom and cable, I might never leave home again. (And the old dogs
would like that just fine.)</TE>

<HD>Shipboard viral outbreaks striking a blow to cruisers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathleen Doheny</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As cruise veterans, Margaret and David Parkhurst of Glendale have had
some memorable trips, but their last, a 16-day Panama Canal voyage in
October on Holland America's Amsterdam, was like no other.</LD>
<LD>   "The trouble started around Acapulco," Margaret, 52, recalls of
the second stop of their cruise. "One night I went to dinner, and no
one at my table of eight was there."</LD>
<LD>   The absent passengers, including David, 55, had contracted a
gastrointestinal illness marked by stomach cramps, diarrhea, nausea
and vomiting.</LD>
<TE>   In the last several months, this illness, caused by the Norwalk
virus or one similar to it, has hit the cruise industry hard.</TE>
<TE>   As of the Travel section's press time Tuesday, more than 1,500
people on at least four ships had recently suffered the illness,
which is usually mild and lasts 24 to 48 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Cruises have been canceled, ships have been washed and washed
again, and now lawsuits have been filed on behalf of unhappy
passengers.</TE>
<TE>   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues
to investigate the outbreaks, which can be caused by contaminated
food or water or by person-to-person contact. The virus, first
identified in 1972 after an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness in
Norwalk, Ohio, can thrive anywhere crowds gather.</TE>
<TE>   Carnival Cruise Line's Fascination last week reported 190
passengers and 13 crew members ill on a three-day cruise to the
Bahamas that returned to Miami on Monday. "We do not know for sure if
it's Norwalk virus," said Jennifer de la Cruz, a spokeswoman. The
Monday departure of the Fascination's four-day Western Caribbean
cruise was delayed about three hours so crews could clean and
disinfect the 2,052-passenger vessel.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of last month, more than 450 passengers and crew on the
past four voyages of the Amsterdam, the ship on which the Parkhursts
sailed, fell ill, according to tallies by the cruise lines and the
CDC. The vessel was docked Nov. 21, and a voyage was canceled while
the ship was disinfected. It sailed again last week.</TE>
<TE>   Gastrointestinal illnesses were also reported last month aboard
Holland America's Statendam on Hawaii sailings.</TE>
<TE>   Disney Cruise Line's Magic was struck with an outbreak that
sickened 462 passengers and crew members on one-week cruises, one
ending Nov. 23 and the other Nov. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Disney cruise line officials canceled the Nov. 30 cruise to the
Eastern Caribbean to disinfect the ship, said Angela Bliss, a
spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   A class-action lawsuit alleging negligence was filed Nov. 25 by
Encino-based Norton &amp; Melnik, working with the Seattle-based firm
Ryan, Swanson &amp; Cleveland, against Holland America on behalf of the
affected Amsterdam passengers. Lawyers could not say as of the Travel
section's deadline what damages they were seeking. Holland America
declined to comment on the case.</TE>
<TE>   The transmission of the virus on the Amsterdam and the Magic is
thought to have been by person-to-person contact, according to the
CDC. If the virus lingers on a surface such as a stairway railing, a
person who touches his hand to the banister, then touches his mouth
with his hand can become infected.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd walk up and down the stairs and a guy would follow you,
cleaning the banister," Margaret Parkhurst says of her Amsterdam
cruise. Rubbing elbows, rather than shaking hands, became the
preferred form of greeting among healthy passengers hoping to stay
that way.</TE>
<TE>   Norwalk virus is often included under the term "traveler's
diarrhea." That malady, said Marc-Alain Widdowson, a CDC
epidemiologist, is actually a "mixed bag of infections of which some
will be caused by E. coli, shigella, salmonella and, some, the
Norwalk virus."</TE>
<TE>   The outbreaks shouldn't deter would-be cruisers, CDC officials
said last month. Dave Forney, chief of the CDC vessel sanitation
programs, termed cruise ships "perfectly safe," although the
infection might hit frail or elderly passengers harder than younger
or healthier ones.</TE>
<TE>   Norwalk-like viruses are not new to cruise ships. "We had similar
outbreaks on multiple vessels up in the Alaska waters last summer,"
Forney said. On Holland America's Ryndam, 388 passengers and 40 crew
members fell ill on two voyages  last summer, a spokesman said. Those
outbreaks also prompted lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The illness isn't confined to cruise ships. "We've had reports of
significant outbreaks in Europe and in South America and in other
parts of the world as well," Forney said.</TE>
<TE>   When illness spreads on a cruise ship, the CDC and the U.S. Coast
Guard may play roles in whether the ship continues sailing. "CDC is
not a regulatory agency, but we have the authority to recommend to a
ship that they not take on passengers or sail," Forney said. "Or if
we feel that it's an imminent public health threat to the individual,
we can issue an order that is issued from the director of the CDC, as
the chief quarantine officer, to the U.S. Coast Guard, to go out and
actually detain that vessel."</TE>
<TE>   If illness on a ship affects 2% of the passengers or crew, cruise
line officials must file a special report with the CDC. Discussion
then begins between the cruise line and the CDC on how to proceed,
Forney said.</TE>
<TE>   For those planning to cruise, attention to hygiene can minimize
the risk of sickness, Forney and Widdowson agreed.</TE>
<TE>   The best preventive measures are frequent and thorough hand
washing with warm water and soap and keeping your hands out of your
mouth.</TE>
<TE>   If you do contract the virus, doctors advise rest and plenty of
fluids to prevent dehydration.</TE>

<HD>Follow the wildlife to Point Reyes Seashore</HD>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Winter is peak season for birds at Point Reyes National Seashore
north of San Francisco. Drakes Estero, a multi-fingered bay, is
patrolled by canvasback, ruddy and American wigeon ducks. Great blue
herons, willets, godwits and other shorebirds feed along the
mudflats. Scores of white pelicans visit annually near the mouth of
the bay.</LD>
<LD>   Bring your field glasses and you also can watch for harbor seals
and sea lions swimming nearby and deer browsing the headlands.
Herefords and Black Angus graze here too. Ranches thrived in these
parts, and beginning in the 1850s schooners maneuvered into Drakes
Estero, took on cargoes of fine butter and delivered them to San
Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   These days one of the best reasons to visit is Bull Point Trail,
which traverses a wide headland between two fingers of Drakes Estero
called Schooner and Creamery bays. The mostly level path, an old farm
road, crosses a grassy landscape near all of this wildlife.</LD>
<TE>   To get there, follow Highway 1 to Olema, turn west on Bear Valley
Road and drive 2 1/4 miles to Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, where you
turn left. Drive almost 11 miles to the signed parking area on the
left side of the road.</TE>
<TE>   For the first 100 yards or so, Bull Point Trail is trampled by
cows and a bit hard to follow, but soon it improves. Nearing the
water, you'll see Schooner Bay to your left and Creamery Bay to the
right. Those poles thrusting up from Schooner Bay belong to oyster
farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Hikers also can pair Bull Point Trail with Estero Trail, an
eight-mile round-trip trek with a 500-foot elevation gain. Estero
Trail is the popular, classic approach to the wildlife-rich estuary
and one of my favorite coastal trails.</TE>

<HD>Ski resorts struggle with requiring kids to wear helmets</HD>
<DH>Colorado resorts are mandating protective headgear;
California has a hands-off approach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chryss Cada</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lori Farmer and her family were just beginning a ski vacation in
Aspen, Colo., in February when she got the call every parent dreads:
Her 9-year-old son, Ryan, had been in a ski accident and was being
airlifted to the hospital.</LD>
<LD>   She and her husband, Don, were hopeful as they raced to the
hospital because they knew their son had been wearing a helmet.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a lot of things you can't protect your children from,"
said Farmer, of North Carolina, "but as a parent, whatever you can
do, you should."</LD>
<TE>   Their insistence may have saved their son's life.</TE>
<TE>   "We walked in, and there was a scared kid in a neck brace with
blood on his face," she said. "He had a fracture in his nose, but
that was all. Noses heal. Brains don't always."</TE>
<TE>   Leonie Arguetty, a 5-year-old from Wellington, Fla., wasn't as
lucky. Leonie, who was not wearing a helmet, skied into a tree during
lessons at Aspen Ski School. She died of a head injury.</TE>
<TE>   Her death, as well as the jarring statistics (the proportion of
skiing and snowboarding head injuries is higher in children than in
any other age group), have spurred new helmet regulations at several
resorts -- most in Colorado -- and others are considering them.</TE>
<TE>   Helmet use by skiers and snowboarders could prevent or reduce the
severity of 44% of head injuries to adults and 53% of head injuries
to children younger than 15, according to a 1998 study by the U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Commission. The study also showed that helmet
use could prevent about 11 skiing- and snowboarding-related deaths
annually.</TE>
<TE>   Aspen, the first Colorado resort to act, began requiring helmets
for ski school students 6 and younger just a month after Arguetty's
fatal accident. This season, all children 12 and younger who are
enrolled in Aspen's ski and snowboard schools are required to wear
one.</TE>
<TE>   Vail will follow Aspen's lead this season, requiring helmets for
children 14 and younger in ski school. The new regulation will be in
effect at all Vail Resorts properties: Vail, Beaver Creek,
Breckenridge and Keystone in Colorado and Heavenly in California. At
Vail Resorts, parents can opt out of the helmet requirement by
signing a waiver. Colorado's Crested Butte Mountain Resort and
Powderhorn resorts have announced that helmets will be mandatory for
all kids 12 and younger participating in the resorts' ski school
programs.</TE>
<TE>   "The accident at Aspen pushed us along, but this is an issue we've
been looking at for a long time," said Bill Jensen, mountain
operations manager for Vail Associates. "There's been more and more
research in the past five years that points toward helmets as the way
to go."</TE>
<TE>   But some California resorts are reluctant to mandate the
protective headgear. Officials at Snow Summit, Mammoth,
Northstar-at-Tahoe and Squaw Valley say the resorts have decided to
let individuals choose what is best for themselves and their
children.</TE>
<TE>   Although many resorts follow the National Ski Areas Assn.'s
guideline that recommends helmets, some resorts don't feel
comfortable even with that. Snow Summit, for example, doesn't even
rent helmets.</TE>
<TE>   "Mandating their use, even having them for rent, exposes resorts
to liability," said Dick Kun, president of Snow Summit. "I think we
are a long way from mandating helmet use [in California]."</TE>
<TE>   As few as five and as many as 16 people have died in ski-related
accidents in California each year, said Bob Roberts, executive
director of California Ski Industries Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any of those accidents would have turned out
differently if the individual was wearing a helmet," Roberts said.
"There is such a variety of causes behind these accidents that there
isn't one thing we can point to and say, 'Ah-ha, that's the cause.'
So here helmet use isn't a real burning issue."</TE>
<TE>   Some also criticize helmets for impeding hearing and question
whether a helmet will protect them in a collision.</TE>
<TE>   "The short answer is, a helmet is the safest and best protection
we have," says Dr. Michael Pietrzak, executive director of the
International Brain Injury Assn. "By skiing in control and following
the other rules of the skier's responsibility code, most accidents
can be avoided. And that's the ideal: never having to need the
helmet."</TE>
<TE>   If you choose to buy a helmet, here are some tips from
www.LidsOnKids.org, a National Ski Areas Assn. Web site:</TE>
<TE>   When buying a ski/snowboard helmet, make sure you buy one designed
for recreational snow sports.</TE>
<TE>   Read the helmet manufacturer's information and learn about the
level of protection the helmet will provide. All models do not
provide the same level of protection.</TE>
<TE>   The most important consideration when purchasing a helmet is the
fit. It should not impede hearing or vision. A helmet is not a piece
of equipment that a child should grow into. If a helmet doesn't fit
correctly, it may not perform to its ability in case of accident.</TE>
<TE>   When shopping for a helmet, take your goggles or borrow a pair
that matches your own from the shop. Look for a helmet that is
engineered to work well with goggles or that integrates goggles. It's
important for a helmet to work with goggles and glasses to maintain
vision, air flow and comfort.</TE>
<TE>   Make sure the helmet conforms to a ski/snowboard helmet standard
(Common European Norm, American Society of Testing and Materials
and/or Snell). Ask an experienced ski shop associate to assist you in
identifying the best brand for your head shape and confirm a proper
fit.</TE>

would have cost $2,400 for her family of four to travel from Burbank
to Tampa, Fla., to attend her grandmother's funeral ("Airlines' Sad

had the same routing for $1,316 round trip for a family of four.</LD>

<LD>I have gone to the Caribbean -- St. Martin, Antigua, Grenada and St.
Lucia -- four times in the last five years. As you mentioned in "If
the Island Life's for You, Now's the Time to Make It Happen" (Travel
Insider, Dec. 1), those islands are interesting alternatives to
Hawaii and Mexico. The Caribbean is a cheaper destination than Hawaii
if you use frequent-flier programs. American Airlines requires 30,000
miles to the Caribbean and 35,000 miles for Hawaii.</LD>

<LD>Susan Spano's report of her experience ("Remembering Some Close
Shaves on the Travel-Writing Road," Her World, Nov. 24) on the island
of Huahine was unfortunate and one that does not accurately reflect
what the island has to offer most tourists. In Tahiti, pensions --
small, family-owned bed-and-breakfast accommodations -- vary widely
in quality and price. We strongly recommend that travelers who wish
to stay in a pension do their research first. Huahine -- while not as
well known as Bora-Bora, Tahiti or Moorea -- has several high-quality
hotels.</LD>

<LD>"Island Crime Problems Point to Trouble in Paradise" (Her World, Oct.
20) was unfair and slanted. There are areas where tourists shouldn't
go on St. Croix, but this can be said of many Caribbean islands.</LD>
<LD>   Susan Spano may think St. Croix is less appealing than St. Thomas,
but St. Thomas does not have the Whim Plantation Museum, where
tourists can see what plantation life was like or Buck Island Reef
National Monument with its underwater snorkeling trail.</LD>
<LD>   True, we don't have million-dollar jewelry and T-shirt shops. We
don't have traffic jams. Things are quieter here. If your idea of fun
is running through jewelry stores and buying a T-shirt, then stay
away.</LD>

<LD>Those negative comments about Rosemary McClure's RV rental experience
are completely off base ("Just Call It 'RVing for Dummies,' "

the typical RV renter, so they must assume they are novices, a bit
clueless and with the minimum qualifications for taking an insured
vehicle off the agency's lot.</LD>

<LD>Vegas, baby, for New Year's? It's not too late</LD>
<LD>   There's still time to book Las Vegas for New Year's Eve, and you
may be pleasantly surprised by the rates.</LD>
<LD>   Prices for shows and rooms are, on average, running the same as
last year's, when they were unusually low because of the post-Sept.
11 downturn, according to surveys by Anthony Curtis' Las Vegas
Advisor newsletter. It also reported that, as of late November, more
hotels had rooms available for this New Year's Eve than for last.</LD>
<TE>   "It's really been a slow comeback for Las Vegas in general,"
Curtis said.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, the lowest available New Year's Eve room rates were
lower than last year's, the surveys found: $375 versus $549 for one
night at the Venetian, $514 versus $658 for two nights at the Hard
Rock. (These prices may have since changed.)</TE>
<TE>   In November, 77 of 86 hotels surveyed said they still had rooms
available for New Year's Eve.</TE>
<TE>   Snow Summit, Bear Mountain offer dual ticket</TE>
<TE>   The Snow Summit ski resort's acquisition of rival Bear Mountain
means changes for travelers to Big Bear Lake this season. The biggest
one is a new lift ticket policy.</TE>
<TE>   Skiers and snowboarders buy one lift ticket that provides access
to both resorts, which are a couple of miles apart; there are free
shuttles. The new policy applies to the entire 2002-2003 season
except holiday periods and Saturdays in January and February, when
dual tickets will be limited to avoid crowding.</TE>
<TE>   Regular-season daylong lift tickets will be $14 for children 7 to
12, $35 for ages 13 to 19 and $43 for ages 20 and up. (Holiday period
rates are higher.) Prices are up $1 to $4 from last season, depending
on the ticket.</TE>
<TE>   Bear Mountain has reconfigured its slopes, shops and dining to be
more youth-oriented. With additions in jumps and rails, the emphasis
is on freestyle skiing and snowboarding. Snow Summit, meanwhile, is
being marketed as a family resort emphasizing traditional downhill
skiing and boarding. The resorts, now known as the Big Bear Mountain
Resorts (www.bigbearmountainresorts.com), opened for the season on
Thanksgiving. Snow Summit information (909) 866-5766, Bear Mountain

<TE>   Caution advised for Americans visiting Kenya</TE>
<TE>   The State Department urged Americans visiting Kenya to "remain
vigilant, particularly in public places frequented by foreigners,"
after a car bomb Nov. 28 killed at least 16 people at a hotel
frequented by Israeli tourists near Mombasa. It stopped short of
warning against travel to the African nation.</TE>
<TE>   Australia went further, advising its citizens Nov. 29 to "defer
nonessential travel to Kenya" because of "the risk of terrorist
attacks against Western interests."</TE>

passengers, mostly Americans, were rescued last week without injury
after a blaze ignited in the engine room.</TE>

<HD>Egyptian Museum opens closets</HD>
<DH>About 250 priceless items stored in the basement will be
put on display for a year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Aline Kazandjian</AU>
<BD>Aline Kazandjian is a freelance writer based in Cairo.</BD>
<DL>Cairo</DL>
<LD>The Egyptian Museum in Cairo will display some of its finest
treasures for the first time in celebration of its centennial,
beginning Monday.</LD>
<LD>   King Tutankhamen is expected to steal the show. The yearlong
"Hidden Treasures" exhibit will include funerary boats and golden
items from the young pharaoh's tomb.</LD>
<LD>   A black granite statue of the goddess Isis, a gold dish and a
golden earring discovered in underwater excavations in Alexandria
will reflect the Greco-Roman period in Egypt's history. The mummies
of two children and golden amulets from the tomb of a governor in the
desert oasis of Bahariya will highlight what became known as the
Valley of the Golden Mummies.</LD>
<TE>   Coming up with the treasures was no problem because antiquities
cram not only the museum but also its basement.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to put up a unique exhibit," said museum director
Mamdouh El-Damati. So the staff headed to the basement and cleared
out seven adjacent rooms where, after a major overhaul, about 250
objects will be displayed.</TE>
<TE>   To prepare the rooms for the exhibit, two entrances were carved in
the western side of the museum building, leading directly into the
basement. A state-of-the-art lighting system and high-security
display windows have been installed. And let's not forget
air-conditioning. There are none of these luxuries in the main
building. In summer tourists sometimes faint because of the heat.</TE>
<TE>   The building, opened in 1902, was designed in the grandest
neoclassical tradition, with high ceilings, domes, decorated columns
and an immense central atrium.</TE>
<TE>   But 100 years and about 5,000 visitors a day have not been kind to
the place. The only significant renovation was in the mummies' room
in 1994 and the Tutankhamen exhibit in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the wooden display cabinets have lost their typewritten
cardboard labels, adding to the mystery of exploring the museum
without so much as a visitor's guide. As part of the centennial, the
museum will offer portable digital guides with audio and images.</TE>
<TE>   The museum is open 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily. The adult entrance fee
is about $4. For information, visit www.museumsector.gov.eg or
www.emuseum.gov.eg.</TE>

to provoke interest in the people who owned each one. Viewers are
"invited to imagine the object's hidden stories ... the travels they
might have taken together," Goggin once wrote. "The simple act of

<HD>No frills but big thrills at Silverton</HD>
<DH>The newest U.S. ski resort, tucked in the San Juan
Mountains, is short on amenities but will give experts a run for
their money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kyle Henley</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Silverton, Colo.</DL>
<LD>There is no easy way down. There's not supposed to be.</LD>
<LD>   Just over the edge of my ski tips was Silverton Mountain, North
America's first new ski area in almost two decades and arguably one
of its most thrilling. With more than 3,000 vertical feet of the
steepest in-bounds slopes in the country, neck-deep powder and
wide-open bowls, it has what expert skiers and snowboarders dream of.</LD>
<LD>   For $99 a day you get nearly unfettered access to this 1,600-acre
ski mountain in southwest Colorado. Because the number of skiers is
limited to 40 a day, you don't have to fight crowds. Groomed runs
don't exist here -- Silverton doesn't even have a grooming machine --
and the resort has only one two-person lift, bought from California's
Mammoth Mountain.</LD>
<TE>   It's the type of steep and deep skiing I live for. I'm a
certifiable powder hound who spends 30 to 40 days a year on skis, but
even I was a little nervous.</TE>
<TE>   I was also excited about being one of the first to ride the lift
to the top of this mountain six miles from town. I'd been following
the development of Silverton for years and made a reservation as soon
as I heard the lift was ready to roll.</TE>
<TE>   Steve DeClute, of Timnath, Colo., my college roommate a lifetime
ago and a top-notch skier, joined me last February on a trip here.</TE>
<TE>   I drove eight hours from Denver and slept at a roadside motel
about an hour north of town, making the final predawn push to this
town 50 or so miles north of Durango.</TE>
<TE>   Now we were here, and I was psyched. The sky was clear and blue,
the wind was howling and frost nipped at my cheeks and nose. Before
proprietor Aaron Brill and I ascended Silverton Mountain, he made
sure the avalanche beacon I was wearing worked properly. The Bureau
of Land Management worries about that danger on this mountain --
there are dozens of major avalanche areas at Silverton -- and has
restricted Brill to 40 guided ski tours each day as a precaution.
Besides the beacon, each of us was required to carry a shovel and an
avalanche probe.</TE>
<TE>   Apprehension and excitement mingled in my head the split-second
before I pushed myself forward, letting the pull of gravity catch me
and the rhythm take over.</TE>
<TE>   The nervousness lessened with each arc I carved on terrain that
was steeper and more challenging than most black-diamond runs at
traditional ski resorts.</TE>
<TE>   By the time I reached the bottom, about an hour after I'd
ascended, my thighs were burning, my chest was heaving and I was
euphoric.</TE>
<TE>   For the best and bravest</TE>
<TE>   Brill's little slice of powdery paradise holds its own against the
West's best ski resorts, many of which I've tackled. Here's how
Silverton stacks up:</TE>
<TE>   More than 400 inches of snow fall here each year, giving Silverton
a ski season that lasts from October until July.</TE>
<TE>   The mountain boasted more than 100 inches of snow when it opened
last month. By contrast, Lake Tahoe's Heavenly Valley gets an average
of 360 inches each year and is usually open only until May.</TE>
<TE>   Silverton's base elevation is 10,400 feet. The top of Mammoth
Mountain -- to my mind the pinnacle of California skiing -- in the
Eastern Sierra is 11,053 feet.</TE>
<TE>   The steepest double-black diamond runs at most ski resorts are 25
to 30 degrees. That is the easiest pitch at Silverton, where the
steepest runs approach a downright scary 55 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   With terrain like that, Silverton is not a place for beginners or
even intermediates. If you brag to friends and family about skiing a
black diamond, you probably aren't ready for Silverton.</TE>
<TE>   This mountain is made for people who spend their days at other
resorts looking for hidden stashes of powder and gnarly terrain
untouched by crowds. And it's for the people who occasionally duck
beneath a rope to frolic in the forbidden treasures just off the main
run.</TE>
<TE>   If the thought of this kind of skiing makes you want to quit your
job and leave your lover, Silverton Mountain is for you.</TE>
<TE>   "Essentially, the advanced and expert skier is underserved," says
Brill, a thirtysomething snowboarder with wavy red hair who is
laid-back in the kind of way that has California all over it. (It's
Berkeley in his case.)</TE>
<TE>   Brill has ski-bummed his way throughout the West, hitting
California, Montana, Utah and points in between. He came up with the
vision for Silverton Mountain while visiting New Zealand, where he
saw mom-and-pop ski areas that offered access to challenging terrain.</TE>
<TE>   After studying ski area management at Colorado Mountain College in
Steamboat Springs, he settled on Silverton. More than two years ago
he began buying up old mining claims on what is now his mountain.</TE>
<TE>   Using grants and low-interest government loans, Brill built his
ski mountain for about $200,000 -- $78,000 less than the median home
price in October for Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   "This is about having a place where advanced skiers and riders can
go and not bang elbows with somebody," he said. "We have extreme
terrain that nobody else has."</TE>
<TE>   With a terrain that is prone to avalanches, Brill has a full-time
ski patrol that monitors snow and weather. They can drop explosives
to trigger controlled slides, among other precautions. Even so,
everyone who rides Silverton must carry the beacon, probe and shovel.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not trying to intimidate anyone, but this is a serious ski
area," Jenny Ader, Brill's business partner, told us at the beginning
of our day. The threat of an avalanche is very real, and Ader tells
skiers to "fight ... swim, kick off your skis, whatever you have to
do" if you get caught in a slide.</TE>
<TE>   The simple life in Silverton</TE>
<TE>   You may spend the day riding wide-open bowls above the timberline
or snaking through tight, tree-lined gullies. Your guide chooses the
runs based on his or her knowledge of the mountain and the skiers'
abilities.</TE>
<TE>   When I skied Silverton, Brill guided me and five others. The
double chairlift spat us out at 12,300 feet. Ordinarily you can climb
to 13,300, which means 3,000 vertical feet staring you dead in the
eye, but we did not because of the avalanche danger.</TE>
<TE>   We didn't miss out on much. A few days before I arrived, the wind
had shifted, blowing snow into new areas. Our group made runs through
the trees, following Brill to pockets of powder. No need to worry
about those going first stealing fresh tracks. There are plenty of
lines for everybody.</TE>
<TE>   But the mountain is unforgiving, and if you get sloppy, you're
sure to take a tumble.</TE>
<TE>   "The skiing is classic Colorado backcountry terrain ... long,
steep and kind of sketchy in some places," said Lance McDonald, 39,
of Telluride who skied the mountain last winter. "It's great to see a
ski area that's all about skiing and riding, and not about shopping
or spa-ing."</TE>
<TE>   Glitzy it's not.</TE>
<TE>   A large canvas tent serves as the base lodge. You must bring your
own lunch. (I ate salami and cheese sitting on the tailgate of a
pickup truck in the tiny parking lot.)</TE>
<TE>   Silverton, a down-on-its-luck mining town, has only 500 year-round
residents and draws few visitors in winter because of its remoteness
and weather. Most of Silverton's tourist-related activity comes
during the summer, when the narrow-gauge train from Durango deposits
a load of visitors in town for a couple of hours each day.</TE>
<TE>   To call the lodging, dining and apres-ski opportunities limited is
an overstatement. Five bed-and-breakfasts and eight motels are among
your few lodging options. Only seven of Silverton's 19 restaurants
are open during the winter.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't expect much from your non-skiing time in Silverton,
the experience can be refreshing, free of the boozy hot-tub culture
that permeates so many other resorts.</TE>
<TE>   The town is disarming, with 100-year-old restored Victorians
standing next to dark and dilapidated miners' cabins. You won't find
a Starbucks, but at the Avalanche coffeehouse the owner's dog, a
heeler named Abby, will greet you with a lazy gaze. You may not be
able to order a bottle of your favorite Bordeaux with dinner, wine
lists being somewhat limited here, but a burger and a beer will cost
you less than $10.</TE>
<TE>   This ski season does promise some improvements in town and on the
mountain. Ski and snowboard rentals will be offered this year, with a
focus on wide skis. Brill also will sell beer and wine to thirsty
skiers now that he has a liquor license.</TE>
<TE>   I left a beer in the car to break open for a post-ski celebration.
After my last run, I popped it open and raised a toast to the best
skiing day of my life.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Experiencing Silverton's steep and deep</TE>
<TE>   GETTING THERE:</TE>
<TE>   From LAX, connecting service (change of planes) is available to
Durango on United and America West. Restricted round-trip fares begin
at $338.</TE>
<TE>   It is about a 90-minute drive north to Silverton on U.S. 550. The
drive includes conquering the sometimes treacherous Molas Divide, the
10,910-foot pass known for its snowy conditions and avalanche danger.
The road is maintained year-round.</TE>
<TE>   All major car rental companies have counters in the Durango
airport. A four-wheel-drive vehicle is not required but is
recommended during the winter months.</TE>
<TE>   SKIING SILVERTON:</TE>
<TE>   Skiers are grouped based on speed and skiing ability. Each group
is guided. Bring your own skis, boots, poles and lunch. If you own an
avalanche beacon, probe and back-country shovel, bring those too. You
are required to have them to ski Silverton, but you can rent them at

<HD>Presents for your favorite vagabonds -- or for me</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Spano</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are two approaches to holiday gift selection. The first
requires that you put yourself in the place of the recipient and
contemplate what he or she might like. In the second, you say, "Oh,
the heck with it," and buy something you want.</LD>
<LD>   For me, that means travel stuff, which is often specially designed
for vagabonds. Sometimes, though, the best travel accessories are
ordinary all-purpose items that have important applications for
travelers.</LD>
<LD>   Here are some of the things I'm thinking of giving -- or is that
hoping to get? -- this holiday season:</LD>
<TE>   Chico's Travelers Collection black skirts ($54 to $58) and
trousers ($52 to $58). Made of an acetate-Lycra blend, the items in
the collection do not wrinkle, can easily be washed in the sink and
have comfy elastic waistbands. My old Chico's ensemble has holes
because I wear it so often when I'm traveling. The skirts are
straight and calf-length, with or without a slit; the pants come slim
at the ankles or flared. Coordinating tank tops are also available.</TE>
<TE>   If you have the basic black bottoms, you can wear anything with
them, from a bikini top on Bora-Bora to a wool blazer in Scotland's
Outer Hebrides. There are numerous Chico's stores in the L.A. area,
including Long Beach, Costa Mesa, Laguna Beach, Marina del Rey,
Manhattan Beach and Pasadena; or you can shop the catalog. (888)
855-4986, www.chicos.com.</TE>
<TE>   Goode's World Atlas, 20th edition (Rand McNally, 2000, $35.95).
World atlases make great presents, especially for students.</TE>
<TE>   When I asked Jim Meacham, who runs the geography lab at the
University of Oregon in Eugene, which one he prefers, he cited
Goode's "because of its thematic maps." The 20th edition has more
than 30 of them, covering demographics, vegetation, politics and
oceanography. The atlas is available at most bookstores and from
online booksellers.</TE>
<TE>   Paris Notes (10 issues, $39). Paris Notes, a newsletter about
what's new, where to stay and eat, and what to do in the City of
Light, is for the Francophile on your list. In a way it's better than
a guidebook because it stays current and has an insider's point of
view, although it's written for tourists.</TE>
<TE>   Upcoming issues will feature stories on the star architects of
Paris and the new Seine River walkway. Subscribers also get access
(via a password) to the Special Guides section of the Paris Notes Web
page, focusing on restaurants and hotels. Paris Notes, P.O. Box
15818, North Hollywood, CA 91615; (800) 677-9660, www.parisnotes.com.</TE>
<TE>   Few items are as useful to a woman traveler as a pashmina shawl,
made of soft cashmere goat wool from the Himalayas. It can be
stylishly slung around the shoulders, folded and used as a pillow or
spread out across the lap like a blanket. Pashminas can be expensive,
especially in better department stores. You can also find them at
online stores. Novica.com, an agent for more than 1,700 artisans
worldwide, guarantees the authenticity of its items. With no
middlemen, craftspeople in such far-flung places as Morocco, Peru,
India, Ghana and Brazil earn more for their wares. Novica.com's
pashminas are made by Syed Izaz Hussein and Nisar Khan, both natives
of Kashmir. Prices range from $85 to $100. www.novica.com.</TE>
<TE>   Silk long johns ($19.95, tops or bottoms). The long road over the
Yukon or the Chilean Andes can be mighty cold, which is why savvy
travelers pack long underwear, best if made of light, washable, warm
silk. Murray Greenberg, founder of SilkJohns in Upper Saddle River,
N.J., says the pieces of silk long underwear you see in stores and
catalogs are made in the same Chinese factories. His are cheaper
because he only sells two styles for women (regular weave crew neck,
textured pointelle scoop neck) and one for men (regular weave crew
neck). Both are available in black or natural at www.silkjohns.com.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Geological Survey Yosemite map ($7). If you love Yosemite you
need a big framed map of the park on your wall to remind you that
there's more to life than work, lawn maintenance and paying bills.
The Yosemite Assn. sells two, created by the U.S. Geological Survey,
that are suitable for framing, one with a green background and
contour lines, the other with shaded relief to show you where the
mountains and valleys are. These are available from the Yosemite
Assn., (209) 379-2648, fax (209) 379-2486, www.yosemitestore.com, or
the U.S. Geological Survey, (303) 202-4700, fax (303) 202-4693.</TE>
<TE>   Don't forget the stocking stuffers: The Night Sky ($6 and $10),
handy star-finding wheels that help you identify what's up there,
available at REI, Amazon.com and Magellans.com (which also has retail
stores in Santa Monica and Santa Barbara); Coghlan's Mosquito Coils
(box of 10, $2.95), to keep pests out of your cabin or tent,
available at hardware, sporting goods and outdoors stores; and
MiniMaglites (two-cell AA battery size and two-cell AAA size, about
$10 to $12), no bells or whistles, just lightweight reliable
flashlights in the dark, available at hardware, discount and outdoors
stores.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Winter adventures don't have to be beyond a student's budget, thanks
to fares offered by student travel services, backpacker budget
transportation services and affordable hostels near many tony and
popular winter resorts.</LD>
<LD>   Student Universe (www.studentuniverse.com), which sells discounted
student air fares on the Internet, has a promotion that combines
affordable air fares and hostel accommodations at many U.S. and
Canadian ski resorts. The rates are for departures Jan. 7 to Feb. 7.
Travel must be completed by Feb. 12.</LD>
<LD>   Low-cost accommodations close to ski resorts are also available
through Student Universe, which has teamed with Hostelworld.com to
provide reservations at hostels.</LD>
<TE>   Hostelling International/American Youth Hostels (www.hiayh.org)
has 36 budget accommodation facilities near major ski/snowboard
resorts in 18 states.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the historic HI-Fireside Inn is only five minutes
from the Breckenridge, Colo., ski resort and less than a half-hour by
free bus from other Colorado ski areas, such as Copper Mountain,
Keystone and Arapahoe Basin. Beds cost $22 to $35 per night. The
HI-Crested Butte International Hostel, where beds range from $18 to
$28 per night in dormitory and private rooms, is only 150 feet from
the free ski shuttle.</TE>
<TE>   In Canada, where the dollar stretches to more than $1.50 Canadian,
there are lots of ways for students and backpackers to ski cheaply.</TE>
<TE>   Moose Travel Network West (www.moosenetwork.com) runs a
twice-daily service between Vancouver, Canada, where the company is
based, and the world-class Whistler/Blackcomb resort for $13.50.
Starting this week through late March, Moose will also operate a
twice-weekly 12-hour bus service from Vancouver to the Canadian
Rockies resorts of Kelowna, Revelstoke, Golden, Lake Louise and
Banff. The $63 fare allows passengers to hop off when they choose and
continue their journey at a later date. Anyone can ride a Moose bus,
but the company caters to hostel customers. Arrivals in Kelowna and
Banff are timed to all-inclusive weeklong winter packages offered by
SameSun Hostels (www.SameSun.com) and Giddy Goat Adventures.</TE>
<TE>   These include Moose's seven-day Okanagan Powder Package, which
offers return transportation between Vancouver and Kelowna, lift
tickets for five days, shuttle service and accommodation at the
recently upgraded Big White and Silver Star hostels (with breakfasts)
for $490. Moose also offers a seven-day Rocky Ripper adventure, which
includes round-trip transportation to Banff from Vancouver. In Banff,
passengers join Giddy Goat Adventure Tours (which runs backpacker day
trips from Banff) for five days of skiing at Sunshine Village, Lake
Louise, Kimberley and Fernie ski areas.</TE>
<TE>   The $541 package includes transportation, lift tickets and
accommodation with breakfasts at hostels operated by the SameSun
Hostel Network, Hostelling International or the new Banff Global
Village Backpackers.</TE>
<TE>   For more information on Moose Travel Network West, including new
three-day packages from Vancouver, call (888) 244-6673.</TE>
<TE>   Hostelling International/Canada (www.hihostels.ca) has 14
ski-and-ride packages, which include a lift ticket, transportation to
the slopes and hostel accommodation with breakfast, for $18.50 to $60
per night. You can stay at the Banff International Hostel and get a
lift ticket valid at Banff, Lake Louise and Sunshine, transportation
and breakfast for $49 to $56 per day, or $137 to $163 for three days.
The five-day package is $228 to $272. Both three- and five-day
packages include one free night ski at Banff's Mt. Norquay.</TE>
<TE>   HI Canada winter packages are available at Mont Tremblant and Val
David (cross-country skiing) in Quebec; Lake Louise, Sunshine
Village, Banff, Nakiska/Kananaskis and Marmot Basin (Jasper) in
Alberta; and Grouse Mountain (Vancouver), Whistler, Sun Peaks
(Kamloops), Vernon (snowshoeing and cross-country skiing) and Fernie
in British Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   For travelers going through Vancouver, there is a new HI hostel at
1025 Granville St., (888) 203-8333, that's been converted from a
hotel. The hostel has private rooms (many with attached bathrooms and
TVs), spacious four-bed dorm rooms, a bar and a free shuttle to bus
and train stations. Rates begin at $12.75 for HI members in a
four-bed dorm. All three Vancouver HI hostels are offering a night's
accommodation and a lift ticket to ski Grouse Mountain (less than 30
minutes from downtown) for $37.</TE>
<TE>   You can stay two nights at any of the HI Vancouver hostels and get
a ticket to a Vancouver Canucks (National Hockey League) game for
$48.</TE>
<TE>   From Dec. 29 to April 6, Moose Travel Network East will operate
seven-day winter packages from Toronto. The backpacker bus, called
the Snowplow, links Toronto to Montreal, Quebec City, Mont Tremblant
and Ottawa, returning to Toronto. For $256 you get transportation in
21-passenger buses to resorts, hostels and activities.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers need to budget $11.50 to $14 per night for hostel beds
and fees for activities, which range from skiing and snowboarding to
visiting an outdoor wildlife park, tubing, skating on Ottawa's
eight-mile rink (the Rideau Canal), a visit to a sugar shack, ice
fishing and dog sledding.</TE>

<HD>Christmas in the Eyes of Children</HD>
<DH>Scooby-Doo gets his first holiday special, and the networks
unwrap a sleigh full of seasonal gifts for young viewers.</DH>

<LD>The holiday television season gets into full swing this week with
encores of such yuletide cartoon favorites as "Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer," as well as the premiere of several new animated specials,
including the WB's "A Scooby-Doo Christmas" and ABC's "Charlie
Brown's Christmas Tales."</LD>
<LD>   "A Scooby-Doo Christmas," coming on the heels of last summer's hit
"Scooby-Doo" feature film, marks the first prime-time holiday special
starring the easily spooked Great Dane and his pals Shaggy, Fred,
Daphne and Velma. Producer and story editor Chuck Sheetz says it
wasn't hard to marry the mystery-adventure plot of a "Scooby-Doo"
episode with a holiday story. "The show has a wide range. There is
the mystery and there are always the comedy bits between Shaggy and
Scooby, and then there is a certain level of action and adventure and
chase stuff; putting a holiday spin on top of that isn't as difficult
as it would seem."</LD>
<LD>   In this outing, Scooby and the gang are planning to spend the
holidays at the condo of Daphne's uncle. "But on the way, they get
caught in a snowstorm and the bridge is out, and they wind up staying
in this small town called Christmas Hollow, and that is where the
mystery starts," Sheetz says.</LD>
<TE>   "A Scooby-Doo Christmas" can be seen Friday at 8:30 p.m on the WB.</TE>

<HD>The Bad Side of 'B-Tracks' Criticized</HD>
<DH>Some contend the year-round schedules at crowded L.A.
Unified schools promote academic inequality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Pierson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Burdened by crowding, Van Nuys High School adopted a year-round
schedule last year to help alleviate the problem.</LD>
<LD>   But in designing a multi-track calendar to accommodate the
school's 2,500 students, critics say the school has created another
problem: a system that promotes academic inequality.</LD>
<LD>   Of the three tracks, they say the one known as "B-track"
encourages low performance because it has the most erratic schedule,
the most inexperienced teachers and the fewest magnet and Advanced
Placement courses available. Some complain there is even a stigma
associated with being a B-track student.</LD>
<TE>   "They say B-track is the dumb track," said Ramon Tovar, an English
teacher at Van Nuys High. "We're not those special magnet kids. So
the most apathetic students are on B-track."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Unified School District officials acknowledge problems
with the multi-track system and say the cash-strapped district is
aggressively seeking alternative solutions to ease crowding. Of the
district's 49 high schools, 19 are on a three-track system.</TE>
<TE>   School officials said they are often forced to stack
high-achieving and low-achieving courses onto separate calendars at
crowded schools because they don't have the resources to spread them
evenly throughout a multi-track system, also known as Concept 6.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody is happy with the Concept 6 calendar, from the
superintendent to the board, and every effort is being made to
replace it," said Merle Price, the district's deputy superintendent
of instructional services. He stressed, however, that the district's
intent is not to discriminate against any student.</TE>
<TE>   But critics argue that B-track is having a damaging effect on
students enrolled in it, a majority of whom struggle with the English
language. They fear these students are being herded toward academic
mediocrity and low expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frightening," said Hector Villagra, of the Mexican American
Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which, two years ago, joined with
the American Civil Liberties Union in suing the state over
substandard schools and year-round calendars. "They're putting kids
on this track that would suffer most from these obstacles," Villagra
said.</TE>
<TE>   Critics are most concerned about the following:</TE>
<TE>   * Despite recent gains, Los Angeles Unified students on B-track
still had the worst record on standardized reading and math tests,
according to a district study of 2001 results.</TE>
<TE>   * B-track has the lowest number of credentialed and experienced
teachers of any calendar, though a new policy has been implemented to
correct the disparity.</TE>
<TE>   * After returning from vacation, B-track students have four days
until their Advanced Placement exams and 18 days before they must
take the standardized California Achievement Test. Tracks A and C
have about 2 1/2 months in class to prepare for their exams.</TE>
<TE>   * Of the 593 Advanced Placement courses offered at the district's
19 year-round high schools, 232 are on A-track, 216 are on C-track
and 145 are on B-track.</TE>
<TE>   * Of the 44 magnet programs at three-track schools, 31 are on
A-track and 11 are on C-track. Only two are on B-track.</TE>
<TE>   Plagued by severe crowding, the 736,000-student district is one of
four school districts in the state that use Concept 6 calendars. The
ideal solution is more teachers and more schools, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But financial concerns stemming from the state's ballooning budget
deficit have made hiring more experienced teachers difficult, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   In November, Los Angeles voters approved a $3.35-billion school
construction bond to pay for 80 new schools. Yet it will be at least
three years before the first schools open and, even then, none of the
existing year-round schools are expected to drop their multi-track
schedules, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   So how does a student end up on a specific track?</TE>
<TE>   Several factors are considered, including where students live,
whether they are enrolled in a magnet program and whether they have
an older brother or sister in the district. Los Angeles Unified rules
mandate that students follow the same track as their older siblings.</TE>
<TE>   Students on A-track have the most traditional schedule, giving
them breaks in the summer, at Christmas and in the spring. Those on
C-track are in class during the summer, then take long breaks at the
end of the year and in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, B-track students end one school term on June 27,
then start a new one on July 1. After two months, classes break for
two months. Students again break for vacation in March and April
before returning on May 1, just in time for exams.</TE>
<TE>   "Students take a few weeks to get into a routine," said Evelyn
Contreras, Van Nuys High's student body president for B-track. "Then
all of a sudden we go on break. You come back and you've forgotten
everything you've learned. The teachers don't want to re-teach the
material, but you have to review. It's an uncomfortable environment."</TE>
<TE>   Contreras said she ended up on B-track because she got bad grades
in the two years before the school switched to a year-round schedule.
The senior said it's unlikely she or her classmates will be able to
improve their academic standing if they remain on the unpopular
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "The perception of B-track students is, they don't want to go to
school," she said. "We're not known for academic achievement.... It's
never going to improve."</TE>
<TE>   At Washington Preparatory High School in South Los Angeles, senior
Evelyn Garcia said she failed a recent English class because she was
discouraged by the on-and-off scheduling of B-track. She said
students on other tracks look down on her and her classmates.</TE>
<TE>   "We're the left-out track," the 17-year-old said. "They criticize
us and say we're different. They have more school spirit."</TE>
<TE>   Norm Morrow, principal at Jefferson High in South-Central Los
Angeles, said B-track's problems do not mean tracks A and C are
without flaws.</TE>
<TE>   "In a Concept 6 school, everyone's going to have challenges,"
Morrow said. "They're all getting 163 days of school, as opposed to
the traditional 180."</TE>
<TE>   District studies show that students at multi-track schools, which
include three-track and four-track schedules, tend to perform worse
on standardized tests than students at single-track schools. And the
multi-track system has resulted in social and class conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison Foster, a senior on A-track in Van Nuys High's performing
arts magnet program, said his school has changed drastically since it
switched to a year-round calendar in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "It's divided the school socially," he said. "The general
consensus about B-track is, they're ghetto, gangsters, thugs and bad
people. It's not true. I know B-track people who are academically
motivated."</TE>
<TE>   One example is Laura Torres. The senior at Roosevelt High in East
Los Angeles often goes to school during her vacation to catch up on
review material and to help her prepare for college by taking
Advanced Placement Spanish and calculus.</TE>
<TE>   Last May, when Scholastic Assessment Test results came in, she was
the only student on B-track to score above 1,000 points.</TE>
<TE>   "The other tracks are given the opportunities," the 17-year old
said. "We have to look for them."</TE>
<TE>   Ross Mitchell, an educational researcher at Gallaudet Research
Institute in Washington, D.C., says this is why many poor immigrant
children end up on B-track.</TE>
<TE>   "The year-round calendar [challenges] people who are not typically
connected to a social warning system," he said. "So the least
attractive vacation schedule will be open to poor families."</TE>
<TE>   Some principals at crowded schools said it makes sense to leave
Advanced Placement classes on tracks that have more high-performing
magnet students, because that's where such classes are most in
demand.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very difficult to have three equal systems," said Mary
Kaufman, principal of Los Angeles High School. "We try very hard to
make them as equal as possible. It's just impossible."</TE>
<TE>   Experts caution that separating students according to academic
ability can have a demoralizing effect on those who struggle in the
classroom.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids aren't stupid," said Anne Wheelock, a Boston College
researcher who has studied the issue. "They pick up quickly that
there's a difference in their program. Over time they believe they
are somehow not worthy of something better."</TE>
<TE>   "It's really hard for these kids to develop a solid academic
identity," she added. "Less is expected of them. They then expect
less of themselves and less of their school."</TE>

<HD>Santa Paula Campus Faces Test</HD>
<DH>Isbell Middle School scored 1 out of 10 in a performance
audit. But the district officials and faculty are committed to a
turnaround.</DH>

<LD>One in an occasional series</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   At first glance, things might have seemed fine at Isbell Middle
School.</LD>
<TE>   Discipline problems on the Santa Paula campus were far fewer than
they were a decade ago. Scores on state achievement tests were the
highest ever. And compared with similar schools across the state,
Isbell ranked near the top.</TE>
<TE>   But to administrators in one of Ventura County's lowest-performing
school districts, fine wasn't good enough.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, district officials invited a team of 10 Ventura
County educators to conduct an extensive audit of the middle school's
instructional program.</TE>
<TE>   They wanted to find out what the school might be doing wrong, and
what should be done to fix it.</TE>
<TE>   The results were not glowing. Rating the school in 41 areas on a
scale from zero to 10, with 10 the highest, the audit gave Isbell an
overall score of 1. "It shows we have some challenges," said Santa
Paula Elementary School District Supt. Luis Villegas. "But what we're
saying is, 'We can do better than that.' "</TE>
<TE>   After sharing the report with Isbell teachers and the principal,
Villegas took the unusual step of issuing a press release about the
unfavorable findings.</TE>
<TE>   The district is serious about improving education for kids living
in the small farm town, Villegas said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be upfront about what we're doing," said Villegas, who
took over the district in August.</TE>
<TE>   An interim superintendent had ordered the audit, which cost about
$30,000. "I think a healthy organization is always looking for
improvement."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason district officials chose to audit Isbell was
because it's the only campus in the Santa Paula Elementary School
District through which all students pass.</TE>
<TE>   Problems there indicate problems across the system, educators
said.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of schools across California have been forced to submit to
curriculum audits as a result of lackluster test scores, said Charles
Weis, Ventura County schools superintendent.</TE>
<TE>   But as government pressure increases to "leave no child behind,"
he said more schools may decide to take that responsibility on
themselves, as Isbell has. "It's not a report card that says you've
failed," Weis said. "It's a report card on how you can do better."</TE>
<TE>   At Isbell, where one-third of the students are still learning
English and 70% come from poor homes, auditors found plenty of room
for improvement in several key areas.</TE>
<TE>   The team spent nearly 60 hours visiting classrooms, interviewing
and surveying hundreds of teachers, administrators, students and
parents.</TE>
<TE>   Among the findings:</TE>
<TE>   * Classroom instruction was apparently not aligned to the state's
rigorous academic standards -- a checklist of facts and skills for
each grade level that all students must master.</TE>
<TE>   * Teachers spent an average of 20% of each class on activity
unrelated to instruction, often giving excessive directions, allowing
numerous interruptions or stopping lessons early.</TE>
<TE>   * Bad communication existed on all levels: Teachers felt parents
were uninvolved; parents said they could not talk to teachers or
office staff because few are bilingual; students wanted more feedback
from teachers; and teachers wanted more attention from district
administration.</TE>
<TE>   * Most class time involved students working independently or in
small groups, and students were not engaged in learning.</TE>
<TE>   * Teachers did not have any time to plan together or share
experiences and ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "Academic expectations for all of Isbell Middle School's students
need to be raised," the audit said. "Equally important is that all
students are challenged and shown how to master higher-order thinking
and problem solving."</TE>
<TE>   Along with the criticism, the report includes more than 150
recommendations aimed at improving student achievement. Isbell
Principal Jess Rodriguez and the school's 51 teachers have pared it
down to 40 that they will tackle over the next three years.</TE>
<TE>   He also formed a task force of eight teachers who will help him
carry out the reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Sixth-grade teacher Lisa Darling is one of them. Initially, she
said, the audit was hard for many teachers to accept.</TE>
<TE>   "Your first reaction is to defend yourself," Darling said. "But I
haven't heard anyone say we can't gain from this. They are willing to
make the changes -- they are just waiting for someone to lead them
there."</TE>
<TE>   Small adjustments already have taken place. Rodriguez, who is
bilingual, has made it clear that his door is open to all parents,
and he organized a parent meeting last week to share the audit
results.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts are underway to expand the school's PTSA, which has a mere
40 members, said past President Laura Phillips. The organization can
do a better job of connecting parents and teachers, she said, as well
as providing mentors to students.</TE>
<TE>   The audit "makes it kind of obvious that communication needs to be
improved," said Phillips, who has a son at Isbell.</TE>
<TE>   In the classroom, Darling said she has tried harder to maximize
the time she spends on actual instruction in each class period.</TE>
<TE>   Karalee Johnson, who teaches special education classes, said she
immediately posted the state standards in her classroom and gave each
student a copy. "This is a vehicle to change," she said. "I would
like to see it move faster."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent school day, there was evidence of progress but also
evidence of the status quo.</TE>
<TE>   In one eighth-grade language arts class, a teacher roamed around
the room as students worked individually.</TE>
<TE>   Some were copying spelling words from a book, but others were
doing math homework. One girl was cleaning out her book bag. Another
read a novel.</TE>
<TE>   Across campus in Phillisann Morten's seventh-grade life science
class, however, all students were focused.</TE>
<TE>   Using colored markers, they drew cells on flashcards and wrote
descriptions on the back.</TE>
<TE>   Without such hands-on activity, the teacher said, "The concept of
a cell can be hard to grasp."</TE>
<TE>   Morten said the audit results were disconcerting until she read
the report.</TE>
<TE>   Then, she said, the recommendations seemed "absolutely doable."</TE>
<TE>   "I really wasn't bummed," she said. "I got a sense of 'Wow, we can
really do something here.' I saw it as a positive way to make things
better for these kids."</TE>

<HD>Catholic Church Set to Battle New Law</HD>
<DH>The measure lifting the statute of limitations in some
molestation cases could start a wave of new suits. Parishioners will
be warned today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Lobdell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An unusual legal battle is shaping up between the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Los Angeles and the Legislature over a new state law
that lifts the statute of limitations for a year in certain
molestation cases.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning Jan. 1, the law gives victims a year to sue any
institution for employing a known molester who went on to claim
another victim. By suspending the usual statute of limitations, it
opens the door to cases that may be decades old.</LD>
<LD>   Church officials and lawyers predict the law will spur hundreds of
suits against the church next year, and a letter to be read by
priests across California today warns parishioners of the expected
legal onslaught.</LD>
<TE>   While legal scholars say it's difficult to predict whether the
archdiocese will succeed in striking down the law, many say the
church is fighting an uphill battle.</TE>
<TE>   The church's strongest argument, several experts said, is against
the law's retroactive nature. Under current state law, victims of
childhood sexual abuse may sue up to their 26th birthday or within
three years of discovering that their emotional problems are linked
to a molestation.</TE>
<TE>   "To reopen that door is very constitutionally questionable,"
potentially violating due-process and other guarantees, said John
Eastman, a professor at Chapman University School of Law in Orange
who specializes in constitutional law. "But it's a very close line.
[The Legislature] is changing the rules after some people may have
sat on their rights for many, many years."</TE>
<TE>   G. Robert Blakey, a professor at Notre Dame Law School, said the
new law is analogous to playing draw poker on the Mississippi River
and the dealer telling the players on the last round of cards that,
"by the way, deuces are wild."</TE>
<TE>   "You'd get shot for that," Blakey said. "What the Legislature has
done is pander to the victim community."</TE>
<TE>   Eastman also pointed out that once the statute of limitations
passes for an institution, it's not reasonable to believe that it
would save records and other potential evidence that could bolster
its case.</TE>
<TE>   Other scholars disagree, saying the flexibility of civil law, as
opposed to the more rigid criminal law, allows for retroactive
statutes like this.</TE>
<TE>   "The legislature even has the power to pass laws year after year
creating new limitation periods that open new windows of liability
exposure," said Wendy J. Murphy, a former prosecutor who now
represents victims of sexual abuse and is a visiting scholar at
Harvard Law School.</TE>
<TE>   Another argument for the retroactivity is that because some cases
were thrown out of court because of statute-of-limitations problems,
the evidence was never weighed.</TE>
<TE>   "There wasn't a final outcome on the merits," said Steven Lubet, a
professor at Northwestern University Law School. "So nobody's getting
a second chance to prove their case; they're getting a first chance."</TE>
<TE>   Retroactivity is far from the only issue, lawyers say. Another is
whether the law was unfairly written with only one target in mind.
Lawmakers passed it earlier this year at a peak of the church's
yearlong sexual abuse scandal.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation is "aimed squarely at the Catholic Church," said
attorney J. Michael Hennigan, who represents the archdiocese.
Although the law applies to any organization, the church is likely to
be most affected, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But many scholars are critical of this objection.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a nonstarter," said Steven Lubet, a professor at
Northwestern University Law School. "The fact that the law itself
applies equally across the board makes it constitutionally sound."</TE>
<TE>   Lubet said many of the nation's laws were inspired by scandals of
a particular company or institution -- for instance, the design flaws
of the Ford Pinto. But the statutes then were applied across the
entire industry.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of what inspired it, that's a silly argument -- maybe
not silly at the dinner table, but in a court of law," Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   Hennigan adds that the law forces the church to defend against
allegations so old that witnesses are dead and evidence is gone.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, church officials say they've recently received a
claim from a man now in his 80s who alleges he was molested by a
priest in 1936.</TE>
<TE>   Even some legal experts who believe the law is valid are
sympathetic to this objection.</TE>
<TE>   "The statute of limitations is designed to protect people from
having to litigate old claims on old evidence," said Gerald Uelman, a
professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, adding that it
makes it difficult to mount a proper defense. "This is why this law
should not have been enacted, but it's within the constitutional
power of the Legislature."</TE>
<TE>   Lubet agreed: "The law may be imprudent or unwise, but that
doesn't allow the court to invalidate."</TE>
<TE>   Arguments that the law is unfair might have been more effective
with the Legislature than with the courts, some legal scholars said.
But the church voiced no objections when it was passed.</TE>
<TE>   Blakey said the church's silence during the debate on the bill
puts it in a weak position.</TE>
<TE>   "They sat on their rights and now are going to cry to a court to
protect them from democracy," he said. "This problem is substantially
one of their own making."</TE>
<TE>   Some wonder if the archdiocese plans to challenge the law only to
discourage victims from filing suit.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy, for example, said prolonging the lawsuits will serve to
delay payouts and discourage victims who don't want to weather a
protracted legal battle. "As a strategic move, it's a card to play,"
Murphy said. "But they may be making a very bad gamble. This may well
be hurtful to some victims."</TE>
<TE>   But church officials said the law is so flawed that it left them
with no choice.</TE>
<TE>   "We face the prospect of horrific litigation," Hennigan said, in
many cases where "we don't have ability to gather any evidence on the
subject, period."</TE>

<HD>Crime Fight Now Job 1 on Hahn's Agenda</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Shuster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fresh on the heels of his victory over secession, Mayor James K. Hahn
is launching a new campaign to reduce crime and make his mark on the
Los Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   Backed by his charismatic new police chief, Hahn is stumping in
the city's minority communities and heading soon to Washington, D.C.,
to meet with Justice Department officials, where he is seeking
federal help in supplementing the LAPD and fighting street gangs. He
is trying to build a coalition of businesses, community groups and
others to thwart recent increases in violent crime, and is developing
new recruitment initiatives for the Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   This public safety focus is not new for Hahn, but it represents a
significant refocusing of a term so far largely dedicated to the
political contest over San Fernando Valley and Hollywood secession
efforts, both of which failed in November.</LD>
<TE>   When he was city attorney, Hahn sought court injunctions against
loitering gang members, moves that brought mixed results. Shortly
after he was elected mayor, Hahn ordered the Police Department to
undertake a number of initiatives to boost recruitment and decrease
resignations and retirements.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's most notable staff moves as mayor have involved the LAPD,
where he rejected a second term for Chief Bernard C. Parks and
brought in William J. Bratton, former New York City police
commissioner, to head the force.</TE>
<TE>   Today, no issue occupies more of Hahn's schedule or attention. He
holds weekly one-on-one lunches with Bratton, and he has a deputy
mayor who is in regular communication with the police chief's
top-ranking officers. Hahn's public schedule includes regular
addresses on crime and policing, and those topics generally dominate
the questions asked of him by reporters and the public.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's attention comes at a time of increased urgency.</TE>
<TE>   The city's homicide count for the year has surpassed 600, with
more than half of those killings occurring in South Los Angeles. In
the last three weeks, more than 20 people have been gunned down in
South Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no more important issue for a mayor than crime," said
Fernando Guerra, a Loyola Marymount University professor who studies
Los Angeles. "Of the big three [issues] -- crime, education and the
economy -- mayors can impact crime. It's the No. 1 game."</TE>
<TE>   While the mayor and his top staff deny it, some City Hall
observers say the recent spate of violence has altered Hahn's
approach and emphasis. They say he needs to prove why he needed to
hire a new police chief and that he needs to make good on public
pledges to make Los Angeles safer, which could come at the expense of
such other weighty issues as housing and transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Still, these people acknowledge that the mayor has put in place a
police chief who is a nationally known, aggressive crime-fighter. If
Bratton is successful here, the mayor also will be successful, that
thinking goes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure I would have chosen this as my No. 1 agenda
post-secession ... but I don't think the mayor has any other choice,"
said Rich Lichtenstein, a political consultant at Marathon
Communications. Crime "is something very, very specific that you can
quantify -- it's either a failure or a success" for the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Politics aside, some civil rights lawyers and others are bracing
for what they fear will be a reprise of some of the city's previous
attempts to stymie gang violence.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Watson is a civil rights lawyer who has made a practice of
representing plaintiffs in cases typically brought against law
enforcement agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "They can spout all their little slogans all they want, but if
they're really serious about it, they're going to do something about
the lack of jobs," Watson said. "They're going at it backward: They
have to start with economics, jobs and education."</TE>
<TE>   The answers to gang violence, Watson and others said, are not
simple. Watson said she has represented young people born and raised
in Los Angeles who have never seen the ocean, kids who believe their
neighborhoods are the only turf they will ever know.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what [the police] are planning on doing -- shoot
them, lock them up, chase them from neighborhood to neighborhood?"
Watson said.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Hahn said he favors a multi-pronged approach, one
that will deal not just with police action but also with gang
prevention and intervention. He is ordering several city departments
to begin working with the Police Department in seven areas of the
city to determine how they can help reduce crime.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday in San Pedro, two LAPD captains joined with other
department leaders to coordinate their response to problems in that
area. Abandoned buildings and cars present problems for that area,
they said, and officials from the various agencies pledged
cooperation in addressing those issues as part of a broader campaign
to suppress crime.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Hahn is meeting this week with representatives of
dozens of community-based groups that receive city money for programs
dealing with young people at risk of criminal behavior. Those groups,
which fall under the L.A. Bridges program, receive hundreds of
thousands of public dollars, and some critics question whether there
are adequate ways to evaluate their effectiveness. Hahn said he will
attempt to determine which of those programs are successful and how
they can be replicated.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to have a strong understanding in this city that you
cannot have economic prosperity, you cannot attract new jobs and new
investment, if people are looking at this area as unsafe," Hahn said.
"We all need to get involved."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said he understands that the job of reducing crime is
not the police chief's alone -- that the LAPD cannot, by itself, make
Los Angeles safe. Still, much of his attention is devoted to the
Police Department and its officers.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn spent much of the last year working on changing the way the
Police Department hires and retains officers. Shortly after taking
office, he made good on a preelection promise to the police union to
allow officers to work on a more flexible schedule. He charged the
city's Personnel Department with working with the LAPD to streamline
hiring procedures for new officers, and he has tried to create
incentives to lure former officers back to the department.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the mayor plans to call in help from federal sources. He will
host a meeting of California's congressional delegation in a couple
of weeks, and his trip to Washington with Bratton will focus on
police hiring as well. He is meeting this week with Bratton and U.S.
Atty. Debra Yang to determine how federal resources and agents can be
more involved.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn also plans to announce new initiatives to boost the hiring of
women in the LAPD, in which about 19% of the officers are female. The
mayor wants to set specific goals for hiring more women and is
seeking reforms in the way female officers are hired and trained.
Hahn said he realizes that his efforts must be continuous and that
changes -- both inside and outside the department -- will take time.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not something that's going to happen overnight," the
mayor said. "It's going to take years to undo the damage that gangs
have done to our communities. We all need to get involved ....We're
talking about real families who are suffering real tragedies."</TE>

<LD>No matter who blew it on the $12-million carpool bridge near John
Wayne Airport, Orange County taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for
others' mistakes.</LD>
<LD>   The designer, builder and state overseers are busy blaming each
other, but the Orange County Transportation Authority already is at
work on more helpful activities. It is paying $100,000 to an
independent expert to determine what went wrong and how to fix it.</LD>
<LD>   OCTA acknowledged its own role in the mess and vowed to fix it:
Though the county pays for the construction through a half-cent sales
tax, OCTA probably failed to stay on top of the construction work.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, the other three parties might have thought to keep the
bill payer informed. But that didn't happen. Back in June 2001,
ironworkers raised concerns that there weren't enough supporting
rings, devices that connect cables and provide extra strength along
the bridge. The designer said the number of rings met design
standards of Caltrans, the project's administrator. But none of the
three -- Caltrans, the design firm, the construction company -- told
OCTA, which didn't find out for more than a year. No one knows if the
supporting rings have anything to do with concrete chunks that have
fallen from the bridge. Engineers are looking at other possible
causes. But OCTA should have had an ongoing role in such important
developments.</TE>
<TE>   Bridge construction stopped in August, but no one bothered to tell
taxpayers for three months.</TE>
<TE>   Officials go to the mat to overcome public reluctance to pass new
taxes. Such fiascos as this, with no one willing to accept a particle
of responsibility, only make working people warier of entrusting more
of their money to government, not to mention the worries they'll have
about driving on this swooping arch of concrete.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA's initial actions restore a small measure of public
confidence. But the ultimate test comes down to money. The bridge
expert from UC San Diego most likely will come up with a reasoned,
objective explanation for the cracked bridge and a smart plan to fix
it--or it will be torn down and rebuilt. His findings probably will
be challenged by whichever company or agency he deems at fault. The
whole mess will probably end in court; but first, the three parties
involved should be forced to fix the problem. OCTA so far has been
careful to say it doesn't want to point fingers; once it has the
facts, though, it will have to start laying blame and insist that
Caltrans and the two firms live up to their promises.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't fair to the county's taxpayers for the project's
completion to get hung up during a long court battle, nor should they
pay an extra penny for this project.</TE>

<LD>The airport at El Toro is dead. Uncle Sam knows it. So do Orange
County voters who on March 5 voted to rezone the 4,700-acre former
Marine air base for a large public park and other non-aviation uses.
Not to mention neighboring cities and the growing cadre of developers
drooling at the prospect of building on 14,000 acres of prime real
estate surrounding the former El Toro Marine air base.</LD>
<LD>   That leaves the Airport Land Use Commission, a little-known but
necessary panel that's charged with keeping urban development from
encroaching on airports and, conversely, protecting the public from
the adverse effects of aircraft noise and accidents. No one will
quarrel with those objectives -- as long as they are being applied to
a commercial airport or a military airfield.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is that neither of those options is in El Toro's
future. The federal government knows it. So do the other
aforementioned parties with an interest in shepherding El Toro into
its long-delayed, post-military future. So it's difficult to
understand why the panel would vote to keep development restrictions
in place until the federal government completes the complicated
process of turning over El Toro for commercial development -- a
process that could take several years.</LD>
<TE>   The panel's vote is scheduled for Dec. 19 as part of a review of
existing limits surrounding John Wayne Airport and other local
airfields. There's nothing up in the air, so to speak, about the
other airports. But commissioners seem to think they have no option
other than continuing restrictions at El Toro because the field is
still owned by the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   The stance clearly frustrates city officials in Irvine, Lake
Forest, Laguna Woods, Rancho Santa Margarita and Aliso Viejo who use
such words as "appalled" to describe their reactions. It also says
something about the dangers of bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   No matter, it seems, that the U.S. Navy doesn't plan to return to
the base. Military brass made that perfectly clear last month in a
letter addressed to panel members. If the commission members won't
take Uncle Sam's words at face value, they should look at his
actions. The cash-strapped Navy is moving at flank speed to sell land
on the base that will be used to make room for new homes, businesses
and public parks.</TE>
<TE>   And, if words and deeds aren't enough, how about logic? The panel
is charged with safeguarding the general welfare of people who live
and work in the shadow of airports. But if the federal government is
readying blueprints that show subdivisions and business parks on the
former base, what's the rationale for restricting development outside
of the former airfield?</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the restrictions that the commission wants to
continue are themselves out of date. The panel is relying upon an
"Air Installations Compatible Use Zones" report that the Department
of Defense uses to ensure that civilian life doesn't encroach on
military bases. But the data in the most current report were last
updated during the 1980s, and the Navy won't be readying another
report because the last military aircraft took off from El Toro in
1999. The Navy recently told The Times' Jean Pasco that existing data
"should not be used as a basis for any land use planning effort."</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Airport Land Use Commission should let reality, not
regulations, guide their thinking come Dec. 19 and vote to eliminate
development limits on land surrounding El Toro.</TE>

<LD>Parents naturally would worry if a program for troubled teenagers
moved next to their children's preschool. So of course the folks
whose kids attend Christian Montessori Academy at the former El Toro
air base are asking tough questions about the new school next door,
the one for middle- and high-schoolers who have run afoul of the law.</LD>
<LD>   But parents are going too far by demanding that the Navy evict the
teen probation program or that Orange County relocate it. While the
fate of El Toro churns slowly through the system, the expanse of base
land and the buildings still standing provide a boon to a county that
needs some extra space -- for both preschoolers and teens with
different lessons to learn.</LD>
<LD>   The county-run probation program -- with 15 teens and capacity to
grow to 75 -- isn't anything like a juvenile detention center. The
youngsters who attend the program are first-time offenders who have
committed nonviolent misdeeds, including burglary and drug use.
They've never held up a place at knifepoint or harmed a young child.
They live at home -- in Irvine and nearby cities -- and travel to
school by bus, like other high school students. They attend classes,
undergo counseling, receive vocational training and join recreational
programs. As for supervision, there is an adult for every two
students.</LD>
<TE>   After the school day, they go home -- probably with a stop at a
local fast-food joint, video store or one of the other spots
teenagers find so fascinating.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, these kids are considered so low-risk and
reclaimable that the justice system trusts them to live in the same
neighborhoods where the preschoolers and their families live. They
could even be next-door neighbors. Or show up at the same restaurants
for dinner. The most restricted and supervised part of their day is
at school.</TE>
<TE>   The county runs several such centers, some in residential
neighborhoods. None has ever caused a problem, according to the
Probation Department. The department got the preschool owner's
approval before the teen program moved in next door, and added a
screened fence to accommodate its neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   The Probation Department -- and the teenagers -- deserve praise
for inviting the preschool parents to come visit the center and talk
to the kids. Some enlightened parents have expressed interest in
doing so.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how fine a preschool a child attends, or how caring the
family, any child can grow into a teenager who will commit a
regrettable mistake. Children at the probation center have parents
who worry about their safety too. Everyone hopes the mothers and
fathers at Christian Montessori will never know that kind of parental
grief. But if they ever do, they would be grateful to have a
progressive program nearby that gives their child some extra help and
another chance.</TE>

<LD>Re "Old Town's Face Lift Has a Flaw," Dec. 1:</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to the "improvements" in the downtown area, I now restrict
my travel through downtown Tustin to my monthly haircut.</LD>
<LD>   If one can find a parking place -- and many have been removed by
the "improvements" -- good luck trying to get out of the parking
place.</LD>
<TE>   Since traffic is more restricted and confined, there is rarely a
break to pull out. One's only hope is that someone else wants the
place.</TE>
<TE>   I have found new merchants in locations where I can drive and park
to replace those that I used to frequent in downtown Tustin. I feel
sorry for the merchants, but it is no longer worth the hassle to go
through town.</TE>

<HD>Debating the Need for Tollway Extension</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Take High Road to Tollway," Nov. 24:</LD>
<LD>   I am disgusted, although not surprised, that members of Congress
have tried over the years to pass special-interest legislation to
exempt Orange County's toll roads from state and federal laws.</LD>
<LD>   I agree with The Times that there should be no special-interest
legislation for the Foothill South tollway. Several of our elected
representatives, including Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein
and Reps. Loretta Sanchez and Susan Davis, have helped ensure that
the toll road will be subject to state laws.</LD>
<TE>   The ill-conceived Foothill South will only encourage development.
We need to protect our last remaining wild lands. Let's not sacrifice
one of the world's biodiversity hotspots for a plan that will not
successfully address local traffic concerns, only to fatten the
wallets of executives.</TE>
<TE>   L. Waylin</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your misguided editorial seems more interested in protecting the
quality of life of slugs and snails than of people. Of course quality
of life incorporates open space, parks and wildlife, but it must also
include the opportunity to enjoy these amenities. How is our quality
of life improved if we sit in freeway traffic for hours every day?</TE>
<TE>   Planning for Foothill South, which began almost four years ago,
will take at least another three years before the first shovel of
dirt is turned.</TE>
<TE>   Foothill South will include undercrossings to enable wildlife to
safely cross the toll road. It will also have state-of-the-art drains
and filters to capture storm-water runoff, keeping the nearby creeks
pristine.</TE>
<TE>   Foothill South will be the most environmentally sensitive road
ever built in California.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Seghers</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kudos to The Times, Sens. Boxer and Feinstein, and Reps. Sanchez
and Davis for helping ensure that the toll road will be subject to
state laws. Their actions will help to keep the aspirations of a
minority from trumping the wishes of the majority.</TE>
<TE>   We must understand by now that new thoroughfares only lead to new
development rather than alleviating crowded highways. A number of our
state parks have been reduced to scenic highways. And on top of it
all, several haven't covered their costs.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Hanck</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was during the Clinton administration, in March 1999, that the
U.S. Corps of Engineers, Federal Highway Administration, U.S. Fish
and Wildlife, and the EPA signed off on the federal "purpose and
need" document that started the current environmental review process
examining nine alternative tollway routes. That document clearly
shows the need for added capacity on the Orange County to San Diego
County route.</TE>
<TE>   The editorial states, "Camp Pendleton brass has reservations and
the Legislature might block the tollway from the state beach." Yes,
one of the alternate routes is through an edge of a state campground
on an easement that was established by the Marine Corps before the
land was leased for a state park. As recently as Nov. 7, 2002, when
he was speaking before the San Clemente Rotary Club, the commanding
general of Camp Pendleton stated that the Marine Corps preferred that
alignment.</TE>
<TE>   But the real issue is finding a way to add capacity. Interstate 5
backs up now through San Clemente and will only get worse as
population grows. Widening I-5 through San Clemente would be a true
environmental disaster to its residents, so the proposed toll road is
the only realistic alternative.</TE>

<LD>Re "Tough Love, or Abuse?" Nov. 21:</LD>
<LD>   The trial of Grady and Deborah Machnick highlights the challenges
faced by teens and parents. Behavior modification alone is not the
answer for making a child more responsible. The relationship between
parent and child is critical since the youth must care whether he or
she meets a parent's expectations, and a parent must be able to
listen in order to understand what is getting in the way. Just like
all relationships, this takes effort.</LD>
<LD>   It is important to realize when you need assistance or a more
objective perspective on ways to help your teen make the successful
transition to adulthood. There are nonprofit groups throughout
Southern California that specialize in working with teens and their
families. There are also a number of youth shelters that can assist
families in crisis.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Spitzer Quits O.C. Board Early," Nov. 20:</LD>
<LD>   Todd Spitzer served us well during his time as Orange County
supervisor and will be sorely missed. This county is much better off
for the fresh approach he brought to local government.</LD>
<LD>   I hope the sense of citizen empowerment that he helped create,
culminating in the passage of Measure V that provides for elected
replacements for supervisors, will affect the actions of the new
board that takes over in late January.</LD>
<TE>   His decision to move on and prepare to tackle his new job was a
fitting final act as supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   It is a pity that the media focused so much on speculation about
why he stepped aside early and so little on the actions of Cynthia
and Tom Coad. Tom Coad seemed to be concerned primarily with his own
interests. Todd Spitzer was doing what is best for the people who
really live in the 3rd District.</TE>
<TE>   We are proud to have had a supervisor with Spitzer's intellect,
dedication to the work of the people, and determination to do the
right thing. Let's wish him good luck in higher office.</TE>

<LD>Re "Oasis to Be Envied," Dec. 1:</LD>
<LD>   A resident of Santa Ana is quoted as saying of Floral Park, "You
can hardly figure out a way to get into the neighborhood. It's like
it's off-limits to certain people."</LD>
<LD>   Oh, please. This is the same lazy-minded whine that surfaces every
time a Santa Ana neighborhood tries to reduce cut-through commuter
traffic. Flower Street, a major north-south arterial, runs straight
into Floral Park. Drivers (of any ethnicity or economic status) can
get into that neighborhood in half a dozen ways.</LD>
<TE>   Modern housing tracts are laid out in circles and cul-de-sacs,
with only a few entry points. Santa Ana's streets, laid out more than
100 years ago, don't benefit from current civic planning, so the same
purpose is accomplished by street narrowing and closures. No
nefarious, secret motives here ... just a desire for quiet
residential streets. The race-baiting hatemongers need to find a new
reason for opposing Santa Ana's revitalization ... this one just
doesn't hold up.</TE>

<TE>   I live in Floral Park, and this is not a "largely white"
neighborhood. In fact, the racial demographics are only slightly
different from Santa Ana as a whole. There are no "traffic
barricades." North Flower Street, for example is a major cut-through
for Orange and Garden Grove residents working or having business in
the Civic Center area just one mile south. The traffic diverters just
keep people moving in an orderly fashion. No streets are blocked at
all -- you just have to enter a different way than you might look to
exit. This is similar to cul-de-sacs in the cookie-cutter suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike some of our neighbors, my family supports the much-needed
school soon to be built near our home. The neighborhood never "went
to court" to block the school.</TE>
<TE>   Floral Park is just one of the better known of Santa Ana's
historical neighborhoods. Many of us who live there are users of the
entire city. We love the diversity, the culture and the lack of tract
homes. We also want what all county residents want: quality of life.
If that means rerouting traffic so it is more difficult to cut
through, it's no different from most O.C. communities.</TE>
<TE>   What should have been a positive piece about a historic
neighborhood in a reputation-challenged city of many, was not.</TE>
<TE>   Howard O. Kieffer</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a resident of Floral Park, I would like to defend my
neighborhood from the negative comments contained in the article
"Oasis to Be Envied." Envy is an ugly quality. Floral Park is a
beautiful neighborhood because its residents work hard to maintain
and enhance it, and they take pride in their homes and its streets.
Instead of criticizing the community, others should be imitating it.
So what if nothing seems out of place? Is that a bad thing? It seems
the detractors would be happier if there were shopping carts and
trash littering the streets. That's not how I want my neighborhood to
look.</TE>

<LD>Re "Dissent Growing Over Rancho Mission Viejo," Dec. 2:</LD>
<LD>   I applaud local residents for stepping forward to make their
voices heard in planning the future of their community and south
Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   The 23,000-acre Rancho Mission Viejo property provides an
opportunity to protect one of our last remaining natural treasures,
our clean air, clean water and beaches, and the quality of life we
would be proud to pass on to our children. Rancho Mission Viejo's
owners also have an opportunity to protect this last remaining
property. They have been able to enjoy their ranching lifestyle and
to do many things with their land. In fact, they have built Rancho
Santa Margarita, Las Flores and Ladera Ranch. But the time has come
for them to do the right thing with this last remaining portion of
land.</LD>
<TE>   Nola Wood</TE>
<TE>   Dana Point</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After a 50-year orgy of building in Orange County, we are left
with ugly urban sprawl, monstrous freeway traffic jams, overcrowded
schools, polluted air and water, decaying infrastructures, chronic
sewage spills, looming water shortages, toxic urban runoff and the
tragic loss of some of California's most beautiful landscapes
forever.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligent, civilized planning demands that we stop and take a
breather from the frantic construction and solve the enormous
problems that development has brought in the last half century. Our
city and county planning departments must recognize that enlightened
planning does not just mean development of land. It also means the
preservation of what is beautiful and always considering quality of
life. Planners must remember that their boss is the public, not the
wealthy builders they meet with on a regular basis. There seems to be
a built-in conflict of interest in their jobs. Planners need to
listen more to the people who pay their salaries: the taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   Developers often argue that a "balance" should be reached between
them and environmentalists. In 1950 the population of Orange County
was 210,000. Today it is 2.8 million. Yes, let us talk about balance.
Instead of more people, more housing projects, more automobiles, more
destructive toll roads, etc., let's call a halt to mindless
construction in the irreplaceable pristine lands of South County.</TE>
<TE>   Marinka Horaok</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The people opposed to the project clearly have no understanding of
the natural right of property. The report demonstrates that the
opponents of the project, who have no title to the land, believe they
have the right to tell those who do hold title how it can be used.
This is an usurpation of property rights. When sanctioned by the
state, it's called socialism.</TE>
<TE>   Property rights are the cornerstone of liberty. It's one thing to
protest the project. It's another for the opponents to believe they
have the right to tell the owners how to use the land. Our schools
need to be teaching the importance of property rights. In fair and
balanced journalism, our news media need to ask the opponents whether
they understand the risks of usurpation of property rights, even if
well-intended, to our freedom.</TE>
<TE>   When we are not free in our property, we are slaves to the state
and to others. Preserved open space is of little value to serfs. Do
the opponents cherish the open space more than their freedom?</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Crawford</TE>
<TE>   Fountain Valley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We have a unique opportunity with Rancho Mission Viejo's remaining
23,000 acres to protect south Orange County's history, scenic
landscapes and natural treasures, and clean air and clean water. We
can preserve these last remaining special lands -- home to many rare
plants and animals, and important water sources. While full
acquisition is the preferred option, we can also allow development
where it makes sense -- outside of our most pristine remaining
watersheds and habitat areas. The time is right for Rancho Mission
Viejo to act now, given public interest, the recent passage of
Proposition 50 and because it's the right thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Mission Viejo has developed vast portions of its property
over the years. Just look at Rancho Santa Margarita, Las Flores and
now Ladera Ranch to see firsthand the growth in those previously
natural areas.</TE>
<TE>   That's why so many of us -- local residents and businesses,
elected officials, environmental leaders and others, including the
Heart and Soul Coalition -- have come together to support a plan that
protects the key scientifically identified resources. That's also why
we've been applauding Supervisor Tom Wilson's bold leadership in
creating a process called South County Outreach and Review Effort,
which ensures early and meaningful community participation.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Priests in O.C. Plan a Day of Penance," Nov. 30:</LD>
<LD>   As a Catholic, I welcome the news that Fathers John McAndrew and
Bill Barman organized a day of penance for the clergy's role in
sexual abuse. But once this day ends, what happens next? Will priests
and laity demand greater accountability and transparency from the
hierarchy, or will this be another show of "solidarity" with no
meaningful consequences?</LD>
<LD>   I know Father McAndrew. He is active in Catholic Worker, in
anti-military demonstrations and in trying to focus society toward a
"preferential option for the poor." Well, the poor in our church now
include those whose innocence and faith have been devastated -- in
some cases, permanently -- by people they trusted. When these priests
and those who think like them are as willing to put themselves on the
line in changing the ecclesiastical structures that prevent
accountability and transparency as they are when it comes to changing
American society, then they deserve a respectful hearing. But not
before.</LD>

<LD>Re "Text of Letter From California Bishops," Dec. 3:</LD>
<LD>   Anyone who has taken a tour at the Vatican in Rome will be taken
aback by the Los Angeles Archdiocese's claim that the Catholic Church
is teetering on the brink of financial ruin because of the sex abuse
lawsuits. You could fill railroad boxcars with the gold and silver on
display there. Perhaps this "accumulation of wealth" could be
liquidated in order to compensate victims of predatory clergy.</LD>

<LD>Re "In Florida, Limit Class Size Now, Pay Later," Nov. 27:</LD>
<LD>   We read with interest the article about school crowding in
Florida. We were especially impressed by the mention of portable
classrooms. We drive by our local high school, Dana Hills, on the
Stonehill side almost every day. We cannot believe the ugly portable
classrooms.</LD>
<LD>   Some of them are close to a busy intersection. With the district
talking of spending $9 million on new district offices, perhaps
priorities should be reexamined. Students are the most important part
of any district and deserve an environment that will encourage them
to be excited and enthusiastic about attending a real school, not a
hodgepodge of portables. It really does look like a Third World
campus or perhaps an abandoned Army camp.</LD>

<LD>Re "Making a Nonviolent Act a Third Strike Is Just Plain Crazy," Nov.
10:</LD>
<LD>   I too am a member of Families to Amend California Three-Strikes. I
have read the reports compiled by Philip Zullo's mental health
professionals. One would not question his mental illness. Zullo would
potentially serve 35 years of the 90-year sentence before his death.
The basic cost of his incarceration to taxpayers is $875,000 in
today's money.</LD>
<LD>   This amount does not include medical or mental health care.</LD>
<TE>   If Zullo is found guilty, California will pay for his mental
health care. He is not likely to hurt anyone, so I say let Fred and
Theresa Zullo continue providing for their son's mental health.
Neither California taxpayers nor the Zullo family would benefit by
incarcerating Philip Zullo under the three-strikes law.</TE>

<HD>Santa Paula Campus Faces Big Challenge</HD>
<DH>Isbell Middle School scored 1 out of 10 in a performance

<DL></DL>
<LD>At first glance, things might have seemed fine at Isbell Middle
School.</LD>
<LD>   Discipline problems on the Santa Paula campus were far fewer than
they were a decade ago. Scores on state achievement tests were the
highest ever. And compared with similar schools across the state,
Isbell ranked near the top.</LD>
<LD>   But to administrators in one of Ventura County's lowest-performing
school districts, fine wasn't good enough. Last spring, district
officials invited a team of 10 Ventura County educators to conduct an
extensive audit of the middle school's instructional program. They
wanted to find out what the school might be doing wrong, and what
should be done to fix it.</LD>
<TE>   The results were not glowing. Rating the school in 41 areas on a
scale from zero to 10, with 10 the highest, the audit gave Isbell an
overall score of 1. "It shows we have some challenges," said Santa
Paula Elementary School District Supt. Luis Villegas. "But what we're
saying is, 'We can do better than that.' "</TE>
<TE>   After sharing the report with Isbell teachers and the principal,
Villegas took the unusual step of issuing a press release about the
unfavorable findings. The district is serious about improving
education for kids living in the small farm town, Villegas said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be upfront about what we're doing," said Villegas, who
took over the district in August. An interim superintendent had
ordered the audit. "I think a healthy organization is always looking
for improvement."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason district officials chose to audit Isbell was
because it's the only campus in the Santa Paula Elementary School
District through which all students pass. Problems there indicate
problems across the system, educators said.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of schools across California have been forced to submit to
curriculum audits as a result of lackluster test scores, said Charles
Weis, Ventura County schools superintendent. But as government
pressure increases to "leave no child behind," he said more schools
may decide to take that responsibility on themselves, as Isbell has.
"It's not a report card that says you've failed," Weis said. "It's a
report card on how you can do better."</TE>
<TE>   At Isbell, where one-third of the students are still learning
English and 70% come from poor homes, auditors found plenty of room
for improvement in several key areas. The team spent nearly 60 hours
visiting classrooms, interviewing and surveying hundreds of teachers,
administrators, students and parents.</TE>
<TE>   Among the findings:</TE>
<TE>   * Classroom instruction was apparently not aligned to the state's
rigorous academic standards -- a checklist of facts and skills for
each grade level that all students must master.</TE>
<TE>   * Teachers spent an average of 20% of each class on activity
unrelated to instruction, often giving excessive directions, allowing
numerous interruptions or stopping lessons early.</TE>
<TE>   * Bad communication existed on all levels: Teachers felt parents
were uninvolved; parents said they could not talk to teachers or
office staff because few are bilingual; students wanted more feedback
from teachers; and teachers wanted more attention from district
administration.</TE>
<TE>   * Most class time involved students working independently or in
small groups, and students were not engaged in learning.</TE>
<TE>   * Teachers did not have any time to plan together or share
experiences and ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "Academic expectations for all of Isbell Middle School's students
need to be raised," the audit said. "Equally important is that all
students are challenged and shown how to master higher-order thinking
and problem solving."</TE>
<TE>   Along with the criticism, the report includes more than 150
recommendations aimed at improving student achievement. Isbell
Principal Jess Rodriguez and the school's 51 teachers have pared it
down to 40 that they will tackle over the next three years. He also
formed a task force of eight teachers who will help him carry out the
reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Small adjustments already have taken place. Rodriguez, who is
bilingual, has made it clear that his door is open to all parents,
and he organized a parent meeting last week to share the audit
results.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts are underway to expand the school's PTSA, which has a mere
40 members, said past President Laura Phillips. The organization can
do a better job of connecting parents and teachers, she said, as well
as providing mentors to students. The audit "makes it kind of obvious
that communication needs to be improved," said Phillips, who has a
son at Isbell.</TE>

<HD>Philip F. Berrigan, 79; Priest and Pacifist Who Helped
Inspire Vietnam War Protests</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claudia Luther</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philip F. Berrigan, a former Josephite priest and one of two
"Berrigan Brothers" who ignited resistance to the Vietnam War in the
late 1960s, died Friday night. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Berrigan -- who had spent a third of the last three decades in
jail for leading protests against the war and later against all
militarism, especially nuclear weapons -- died of liver and kidney
cancer at Jonah House, the communal residence for pacifists that he
founded in Baltimore.</LD>
<LD>   He made a decision to halt chemotherapy treatment about a month
ago. His brother, Father Daniel Berrigan, officiated at the last
rites Nov. 30, witnessed by friends and peace activists, family
members said.</LD>
<TE>   In a statement given to his wife, Elizabeth McAlister, during the
Thanksgiving weekend, Philip Berrigan said: "I die with the
conviction, held since 1968 and Catonsville, that nuclear weapons are
the scourge of the Earth; to mine for them, manufacture them, deploy
them, use them, is a curse against God, the human family and the
Earth itself."</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, before his last stint in prison for banging on
warplanes at a National Guard base, the indefatigable and buoyant
activist said he wanted to "die with my boots on."</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to die being of use to other people, writing or speaking
some truth, or maybe even during a course of action," he said. "Not
on the beach."</TE>
<TE>   Berrigan and his even more famous brother, a poet and writer, came
to wide national attention in 1968 as two of the "Catonsville Nine."
The group was arrested for entering a draft board office in
Catonsville, outside Baltimore, removing draft records in wire trash
baskets and taking them to the parking lot, where they torched them
with homemade napalm. It was "soap chips and gasoline from a recipe
we found in a Green Beret handbook," Philip Berrigan wrote in his
1996 autobiography, "Fighting the Lamb's War: Skirmishes With the
American Empire."</TE>
<TE>   "May this make clear that napalm is immorally and illegally
destroying human lives in Vietnam," one of the protesters said to
members of the media who had been alerted to the incident. Cameras
whirred as the protesters -- seven men and two women, all Roman
Catholics -- said the Lord's Prayer and waited to be arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Men of the Cloth</TE>
<TE>   Today, long past the time when Vietnam War protests galvanized a
generation and threatened to rip the nation apart, it is hard to
remember how stunning the civil disobedience of those men of the
cloth was. Their actions -- believed to be the first by American
Catholic priests criticizing their government's war policy -- landed
them on the cover of Time magazine and inspired many others to join
the antiwar movement.</TE>
<TE>   "To pick up a newspaper in 1968 and see a photo of two Catholic
priests in full Roman collars praying over a flaming pile of 1-A
draft files -- nothing could be more shocking," said Jim O'Grady,
co-author of a 1997 biography of the Berrigans, "Disarmed and
Dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   The Berrigans were convicted of destroying government property.
Philip was sentenced to three years and two months in prison, to run
concurrently with a six-year sentence for a raid -- this one
involving throwing blood on draft records -- the previous year on a
draft board office in Baltimore. After sentencing, both Berrigans at
first rather openly hid from the authorities, but eventually were
arrested and served their terms. Philip was paroled after 2 1/2
years, Dan after 17 months.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Berrigan wrote a play about the Catonsville raid, "The Trial
of the Catonsville Nine," which ran off-Broadway in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   "Dan and I went to prison because we believed that Christianity
and revolution are synonymous," Philip Berrigan wrote later. He also
believed that true Christianity required a vow of poverty. "The next
car is every man's dolce vita," he once said.</TE>
<TE>   During his time in prison for the Catonsville raid, Philip was
secretly married to McAlister, a nun whom he met in the antiwar
movement. They disclosed the marriage in 1973, and both were
immediately excommunicated.</TE>
<TE>   While he was in jail, he and McAlister exchanged letters that were
later used to indict both for allegedly plotting to kidnap Henry
Kissinger, among other charges. After a highly publicized trial, they
were found guilty of a single count: smuggling their letters to each
other.</TE>
<TE>   Brothers, Best Friends</TE>
<TE>   The Berrigan Brothers -- the youngest two of six sons born to
Frida and Thomas Berrigan -- were each other's best friend from
childhood and led one another along the path to activism.</TE>
<TE>   But to some degree, they competed. After one arrest, Philip wrote
in "Fighting the Lamb's War" (1996), "Everyone seemed to be paying
more attention to him, laughing at his jokes, taking his picture,
asking him for a good, pithy quote. Devoured by jealousy, I accused
him of grandstanding." They soon patched it up, however.</TE>
<TE>   Francine du Plessix Gray, writing in the New Yorker in 1970,
described Philip Berrigan this way: "The spell he casts over human
beings is as great as Daniel's and more alarming. Daniel might be
more content to have his disciples rattle and needle the world.
Philip wants them to transform society totally and as soon as
possible. His eyes are merry, affectionate and yet fiercely
impatient."</TE>
<TE>   Philip Berrigan was born in a small Minnesota town Oct. 5, 1923.
His father was a socialist who worked as a railroader until he lost
his job. He then moved the family to Syracuse, N.Y., where he founded
the Electrical Workers Union and started a Catholic Interracial
Council.</TE>
<TE>   Philip, a tall and athletic man, was drafted into the Army in 1943
and saw combat in Europe as an infantryman. Of the "strange and
bewildering contradictions of war," he later wrote, "I killed in
order to prove the immorality of killing. I massacred in order to
demonstrate the illegality of mass murder. I laid waste to show that
laying waste is unjust."</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he graduated from Holy Cross College in Worcester,
Mass., and followed his older brother, Jerome, into the Society of
St. Joseph, an order known as the Josephite Fathers that is devoted
to helping African Americans. Philip was ordained in 1955 and was
assigned to New Orleans, where he taught English and did student
counseling in a black ghetto.</TE>
<TE>   But Daniel, a Jesuit who was ordained in 1952 and never left the
church, said his youngest brother was "incurably secular."</TE>
<TE>   "He saw the church as one resource, bringing to bear on the
squalid facts of racism, the light of the Gospel, the presence of
inventive courage and hope."</TE>
<TE>   While in the South, Philip became more and more involved in
freedom rides and civil rights marches. Stokely Carmichael, who
organized the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the 1960s,
once called him "the only white man who knows where it's at."</TE>
<TE>   Race and the War</TE>
<TE>   It was not long before Berrigan drew a connection between racial
discrimination and the Vietnam War, asking, "Is it possible for us to
be vicious, brutal, immoral and violent at home and be fair,
judicious, beneficent and idealistic abroad?" He clearly concluded
that it was not.</TE>
<TE>   His controversial and increasingly more public beliefs in the
mid-1960s led to his transfer to a parish in Newburgh, N.Y., and
later to Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   His first act of protest against the war soon followed. He and
three others drew some of their own blood and, when they couldn't
draw enough, bought duck blood and calves' liver blood at a
delicatessen, carefully pouring it into Mr. Clean bottles.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 27, 1967, they entered a draft board office in Baltimore
and drizzled blood -- a powerful symbol of Christ's gift of
redemption to mankind -- on draft records. As surprised clerks looked
on, the four men waited to be arrested.</TE>
<TE>   The protest drew much publicity and many to the cause, but Philip
-- always the more political of the two brothers -- believed
something more was needed.</TE>
<TE>   Six months later, he persuaded Daniel to join him and seven others
on a sunny day in May for the more daring Catonsville raid, in which
378 draft cards were incinerated. Daniel wrote of this day: "Our
apologies, good friends, for this fracture of good order. The burning
of paper, instead of children."</TE>
<TE>   Such statements puzzled many in the establishment, including the
Nixon administration. John W. Dean, who was White House counsel for
President Nixon, said Friday that his White House colleagues "never
understood men of conscience" such as the Berrigans. "That," he said,
"was unfortunate, for they had much to teach us."</TE>
<TE>   Many others agreed with the Berrigans' stance on the war but were
critical of their radical Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   During the next 35 years, Philip Berrigan continued his life of
protest, though never again generating as much notoriety. He once
estimated that he had been arrested more than 100 times.</TE>
<TE>   In 1975, he and 21 others were arrested in East Hartford, Conn.,
after throwing red liquid on several military aircraft. In the last
two decades, most of his arrests were due to activities of
Plowshares, an antiwar, anti-nuclear movement that has spread to
Europe and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   His last act of civil disobedience was banging with hammers on
A-10 Warthog warplanes in an anti-nuclear protest at the Warfield Air
National Guard base in Middle River, Md.</TE>
<TE>   The use of primitive weapons against modern weapons of war was
symbolic. He believed that the Bible gave him the authority to be an
activist committed to "destroying the implements of war."</TE>
<TE>   Berrigan often quoted Isaiah 2:4, which says, "and they will
hammer their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning
hooks." Without that belief in his rightness, he told the Baltimore
Sun this year, "I wouldn't be doing it."</TE>
<TE>   During his last stint in prison -- he was assigned to cleaning
cigarette butts in the outside smoking area -- Berrigan said he found
incarceration more difficult physically. "Doing prison is really a
younger person's job," the much thinner and more frail Berrigan told
the Sun. He was released last Dec. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Pacifists Together</TE>
<TE>   Berrigan and his wife helped start Jonah House, a small community
of pacifists who lived, worked, raised children and planned protests
together. They had three children: Kathleen, Frida and Jerry. All
survive.</TE>
<TE>   Berrigan said that although there was much left to be done, he
never despaired.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to stay in there, speaking some sanity and some
nonviolence," he told the Washington Post in 1997. "We didn't quit.
That's epitaph enough."</TE>

<HD>Cultivating a Clientele of Farm Workers</HD>
<DH>A Ventura County program goes into the fields to sign
people up for parenting classes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Alvarez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's morning break at the Emerald Mist strawberry farm and workers
are at rest between rows of bright red berries, making them easy
pickings for the helping hands of Teresita Montoya.</LD>
<LD>   The outreach worker is on the front lines of a new effort to
deliver family services to Ventura County farm workers, scouring
agricultural areas to spread the word about programs often out of
reach for those who stoop in the fields.</LD>
<LD>   "We are coming to places where we encounter the most need,"
Montoya explains to the harvesting crew at the strawberry field just
outside Ventura.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't charge for any of our programs," she says. "We provide
transportation and child care. We are trying to eliminate all of the
obstacles that could prevent you from attending."</TE>
<TE>   Launched in the spring, the Harvest for a Better Life program
offers parenting classes, couples counseling and other services to
agricultural workers through a two-year, $350,000 grant from the
California Endowment health foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The program is run by the Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual
Violence, in conjunction with a county project involving a network of
volunteer health-care advocates.</TE>
<TE>   The effort is unique locally in that it cultivates clients in the
fields. Seven growers have agreed to allow outreach workers to visit
their farms during the workday, setting aside time for laborers to
learn about the services and even sign up on the spot for upcoming
classes.</TE>
<TE>   So far, about a quarter of the 78 people who have enrolled in
parenting classes through the new program have been recruited
directly out of the fields.</TE>
<TE>   "Some growers might not like it, but I think it's good information
for the workers," said strawberry grower Humberto Candelario, who has
permitted outreach workers to visit his ranches three times since the
program began in March. "If it works for the people, I say let them
come."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the focus is on promoting stronger families and curbing
domestic violence.</TE>
<TE>   Program officials and violence prevention specialists say that
does not mean there is more domestic violence among farm workers than
among the population as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   However, family violence has been linked to poverty, unemployment
and other stress-inducing factors that often plague those who work
the fields. Add to that the language barriers faced by many
agricultural workers and their general lack of access to social
programs, and officials say the outreach effort was all the more
pressing.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping this opens the door to more services for this
population," said Harvest program manager Veronica Vera-Vargas, the
daughter of a retired Oxnard farm worker.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Latino culture, family is very important," Vera-Vargas
said. "So the question was, how could we make it stronger and
preserve family unity?"</TE>

<HD>Cultivating a Clientele of Farm Workers</HD>
<DH>A social service program visits the fields of Ventura
County to sign up laborers for classes aimed at strengthening
families.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's morning break at the Emerald Mist strawberry farm and workers
are at rest between rows of bright red berries, making them easy
pickings for the helping hands of Teresita Montoya.</LD>
<LD>   The outreach worker is on the front lines of a new effort to
deliver family services to Ventura County farm workers, scouring
agricultural areas to spread the word about programs often out of
reach for those who stoop in the fields.</LD>
<LD>   "We are coming to places where we encounter the most need,"
Montoya explains to the harvesting crew at the strawberry field just
outside Ventura.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't charge for any of our programs," she says. "We provide
transportation and child care. We are trying to eliminate all of the
obstacles that could prevent you from attending."</TE>
<TE>   Launched in the spring, the Harvest for a Better Life program
offers parenting classes, couples counseling and other services to
agricultural workers through a two-year, $350,000 grant from the
California Endowment health foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The program is run by the Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual
Violence, in conjunction with a county project involving a network of
volunteer health-care advocates.</TE>
<TE>   The effort is unique locally in that it cultivates clients in the
fields. Seven growers have agreed to allow outreach workers to visit
their farms during the workday, setting aside time for laborers to
learn about the services and even sign up on the spot for upcoming
classes.</TE>
<TE>   So far, about a quarter of the 78 people who have enrolled in
parenting classes through the new program have been recruited
directly out of the fields.</TE>
<TE>   "Some growers might not like it, but I think it's good information
for the workers," said strawberry grower Humberto Candelario, who has
permitted outreach workers to visit his ranches three times since the
program began in March. "If it works for the people, I say let them
come."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the focus is on promoting stronger families and curbing
domestic and sexual violence.</TE>
<TE>   Program officials and violence prevention specialists say that
does not mean there is more domestic violence among farm workers than
among the population as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   However, family violence has been linked to poverty, unemployment
and other stress-inducing factors that often plague those who work
the fields.</TE>
<TE>   Add to that the language barriers faced by many agricultural
workers and their general lack of access to social programs, and
officials say the outreach effort was all the more pressing.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping this opens the door to more services for this
population," said Harvest program manager Veronica Vera-Vargas, the
daughter of a retired Oxnard farm worker.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Latino culture, family is very important," Vera-Vargas
said. "So the question was, how could we make it stronger and
preserve family unity?"</TE>
<TE>   It starts with a big, white 15-passenger van rumbling along the
rutted dirt roads that crisscross strawberry farms of the Oxnard
Plain.</TE>
<TE>   While word is spread through Spanish-language radio spots and
fliers distributed at schools and social service agencies, it's this
face-to-face approach that sets the effort apart.</TE>
<TE>   Outreach workers have trekked dozens of times into fields around
Oxnard, Camarillo and Santa Paula. On each visit, growers gather
their workers into small groups and urge them to listen to what is
being offered.</TE>
<TE>   One farmer even produced a certificate from a parenting class he
had completed to get workers to warm to the idea.</TE>
<TE>   That kind of reception has been crucial in getting the program off
the ground. And officials hope to expand the outreach work next year
by connecting with agricultural workers in the county's nursery
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Nursery owner Ellen Brokaw already has invited them to come talk
to employees at her Saticoy operation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge challenge to try to get this kind of information
where it needs to go and in a form that people will use," Brokaw
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Harvest program, the resources are plentiful.</TE>
<TE>   The program offers free child care and classes that allow
youngsters to deal with their emotions through artistic expression.</TE>
<TE>   It offers support groups to couples wrestling with troubled
relationships or simply looking to improve communication skills.</TE>
<TE>   And it provides classes to parents who want to build better
relationships with their children, sessions where they learn
everything from how to set boundaries to how to stoke self-esteem.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition has put on six 10-week parenting sessions so far,
including one that concluded last week at Haycox School in South
Oxnard. During a recent session, more than a dozen parents crammed
into an elementary school classroom for a night session, their knees
bumping up against child-sized desks.</TE>
<TE>   A mother struggling to place limits on her daughter peppered
instructor Celia Laguna with questions in Spanish. At one table, a
translator provided a running commentary for a couple from the
Mexican state of Oaxaca, who speak only an indigenous language known
as Mixteco.</TE>
<TE>   Juventino and Petra Martinez, the parents of three young children,
say they've learned plenty since the sessions began.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to learn how to be better parents," explained Juventino
Martinez, 32, a landscaper in the Saticoy area.</TE>
<TE>   "We have learned to have patience with our children, options for
discipline and setting rules in the house," he said. "Many parents
don't know these things. If there were more classes like this, it
would be better between children and parents."</TE>

<HD>Helping to Mold Good Sports in Game of Life</HD>
<DH>Hundreds of volunteers provide a positive outlet for
thousands of young volleyball and soccer players in 'underserved'
portions of L.A. County.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julie Tamaki</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Linda Coleman is coaching her 11-year-old daughter's soccer team on a
shoddy field in Boyle Heights with the hope that the girl and her
friends will begin adolescence differently than she did.</LD>
<LD>   Coleman is convinced that, if she had been allowed to play
softball as a girl, she would have avoided her early encounters with
gangs and alcohol while growing up.</LD>
<LD>   "If kids are not involved in something organized, they get into
gangs, drugs or get pregnant," said Coleman, 42, a volunteer coach
and mother of six.</LD>
<TE>   Hope for their four daughters also drives Joanne and Corey
Birdsall to show up six days a week at Bodger Park in Hawthorne,
where they volunteer their time so that their children and hundreds
of others can play soccer and volleyball.</TE>
<TE>   "The place we're living now isn't the greatest, so I'd rather have
them here where I can keep an eye on them,'' said Corey Birdsall, 43,
a church janitor who lives in another part of Hawthorne.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman and the Birdsalls are some of the 700 volunteers who help
run 14 sports clubs operated by Kids in Sports. Each year the
nonprofit group introduces more than 9,000 children, mostly from
"underserved neighborhoods" throughout Los Angeles County, to
athletic activities ranging from baseball to basketball to swimming.</TE>
<TE>   The clubs rely on parents and other adults volunteering as coaches
and club board members. Local school and park officials help out by
providing fields and courts for games and rooms for meetings.</TE>
<TE>   The folks at Kids in Sports teach the parent volunteers how to
coach and run the clubs. They also provide uniforms and referees.</TE>
<TE>   The community effort allows children who hail from some of Los
Angeles County's toughest neighborhoods to experience what it's like
be part of a team and gain athletic skills.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that sport participation is a birthright," said Anita
DeFrantz, president of Kids in Sports and an International Olympic
Committee member from Los Angeles. "We are working to make certain
that every child has access to this birthright."</TE>
<TE>   DeFrantz, who also is president of the Amateur Athletic
Foundation, hoped to promote European-styled sports clubs in Los
Angeles County, and Kids in Sports was incorporated as a nonprofit in
1994 with seed money from the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   DeFrantz envisions a day when each of the clubs becomes
self-sustaining so that Kids in Sports, which operates on a
$1.3-million budget, can open clubs in different neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Cruickshank, executive director of Kids in Sports, estimates
that his group is two to three years away from spinning off its first
club.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough," Cruickshank said. "We're working with people who are
stretched in all different ways."</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, for example, is not your typical soccer mom. She doesn't
own a car, let alone a sport utility vehicle, so she travels to Pecan
Park by foot. And unlike some parents, she emphasizes "fun before
winning."</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, who works part time as a sports coordinator for the city
of Los Angeles, said she could use more help from other parents. But
in many cases, she added, both parents are working long days.</TE>
<TE>   Because Kids in Sports provides uniforms and referees to officiate
games, Coleman said, her club is able to keep fees low. Parents are
asked to pay $15 per sports season, which covers trophies and an
awards banquet. Not all families can afford even that modest fee,
prompting Coleman to occasionally dig into her own pockets.</TE>
<TE>   As dusk set upon Pecan Park on a recent evening, Coleman prepared
a team of 16 girls, the Scorpion Queens, for an evening match with a
visiting team from Cypress.</TE>
<TE>   One moment Coleman is ordering the girls to stretch and practice
with soccer balls, the next she's passing out their mandatory
identification cards. Later, Coleman becomes a human jewelry box as
the girls, who range in age from 9 to 12, hand her their earrings and
necklaces before they take the field.</TE>
<TE>   "Defense! Cover the goal!" Coleman barks at her team as the game
gets underway.</TE>
<TE>   The game ends in a tie, 1 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   A similar scenario is played out the next night in Hawthorne, only
on a much grander scale. Corey and Joanne Birdsall are keeping an eye
on three different soccer games at Bodger Park, doing just about
everything -- recruiting possible coaches, hunting down a missing
goal and rounding up some girls for a game of volleyball.</TE>
<TE>   It's not uncommon for Joanne to help her husband finish up his day
job at the church so that they can make it to the park by 6 p.m. to
prepare for weeknight practices and games. They're back at the park
on Saturdays for more games and assorted minor crises.</TE>
<TE>   The sports club the Birdsalls help run at Bodger Park includes 23
soccer and four volleyball teams. Corey is the club's president and
Joanne coordinates the girls' teams.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the Birdsalls are busy raising their four
daughters, three of whom play on teams.</TE>
<TE>   "Come Saturday around 6 p.m. I'm wondering why I'm doing it,"
Corey Birdsall said. "But then I see the kids and I'm off and running
again."</TE>
<TE>   "For some of these kids," Joanne Birdsall added, "this is what
they live for."</TE>

<HD>Hearst Plan Is Latest Twist in a Long Saga</HD>
<DH>Scaled-back proposal for ranch pleases some longtime
critics and environmentalists, but many questions remain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Johnson and Kenneth R. Weiss</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was to be called Piedra Blanca, a gleaming new city at the edge of
an untroubled sea.</LD>
<LD>   It was 1965. The Hearst family had big plans for its majestic
82,000-acre coastal ranch. In place of the stark and mostly treeless
landscape, there would arise a thriving city of 65,000 people. There
would be hotels, businesses, Hearst Airport and a bustling marina.</LD>
<LD>   Think Santa Monica at the foot of Hearst Castle, but move it just
down the road from Big Sur.</LD>
<TE>   That plan vanished into history as the legendary newspaper family
quietly pulled back its plan and left the pastureland mostly to its
cattle. But as people who deal with them say, the Hearsts don't give
up easily.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-seven years later, they are back with a more
environmentally friendly proposal: No longer is there talk of new
cities, a resort village on stunning San Simeon Point, or golf
courses and riding stables.</TE>
<TE>   The only vacation development that remains part of the plan made
public last week would be an inn, to be built in Old San Simeon
Village. With future generations of Hearsts in mind, negotiators for
the Hearst Corp. are also asking for 27 home sites, to be clustered
east of Highway 1. They also want a couple of private beaches so the
Hearst children won't have to share their sand pails with outsiders.
One more thing: They're asking for $100 million in cash.</TE>
<TE>   That's hardly chump change. But some of Hearst's strongest critics
say the publishing empire may finally have come up with a deal
taxpayers can't refuse.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm basically a very paranoid person," said Shirley Bianchi, a
member of the San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors and
historically a staunch Hearst critic. "But if this framework goes
through I, for one, am ecstatic."</TE>
<TE>   And as to the $100-million price tag to guarantee that Piedra
Blanca will never be built? "A bargain," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some people insist it's too early to celebrate, however, and it
remains unclear whether the state and private foundations can come up
with that kind of money to forestall greater development by the
Hearst Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime residents and environmentalists say there are still
plenty of other unanswered questions and unresolved issues, as well.
These skeptics fear a bandwagon is developing in favor of the deal.
They worry that local and state officials are becoming so giddy at
having Hearst Ranch almost within grasp that they won't scrutinize
the details closely enough.</TE>
<TE>   "This deal is so big, it has the capacity to corrupt anyone
involved in it," said Kat McConnell, a longtime environmentalist on
the Central Coast. "That includes the governor, the Legislature, land
trusts and local politicians."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the hardest thing to overcome as negotiators try to
finalize a deal in time for Christmas is a legacy of mistrust and
suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a hostile relationship with the local community for
a long time," said McConnell.</TE>
<TE>   The relationship has been so poisonous that Bianchi said that
Stephen T. Hearst, the grandson of William Randolph Hearst who is now
in charge of the ranch, told her not a single environmentalist would
sit down with him when he tried to get talks moving again three years
ago. When Hearst invited Bianchi over, she made her assistant go
along. "I was not going to talk to a Hearst alone," she said,
half-joking.</TE>
<TE>   What to do with the Hearsts' vast holdings has been a topic of
debate on the Central Coast since William Randolph Hearst built his
castle and invited pals and entertainers up for his legendary
weekend-long parties.</TE>
<TE>   In the early days, the small cluster of shops at Old San Simeon
Village met visitors' needs. As time went on, and the Hearst empire
became less a family operation and assumed a corporate identity,
planning for the future of the ranch grew in scope.</TE>
<TE>   In 1965, Hearst revealed its plan to build a new city. Besides all
the construction, planners envisioned damming two creeks on the ranch
to form lakes. Although it was submitted, the plan was never put
through the detailed county planning process, Bianchi said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent times, the Hearst Corp. downsized its plan to focus on a
visitor resort, riding stables and golf courses. The centerpiece of
the development would be scenic San Simeon Point. That plan ran into
one roadblock after another -- first from environmental groups and
then the California Coastal Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Then, three years ago, Stephen Hearst, a general manager of the
company land and livestock divisions, showed up. Smiling and inviting
everyone willing to come to lunch at the ranch, his charm offensive
was designed to change the Hearst image. Gone, he said, was the
high-handed corporate style of years past. In its place, he presented
himself as a neighbor trying to do what's best for the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   That effort snagged when it was revealed the Hearsts had quietly
dug up historic property records that could be used to build hundreds
of homes on the ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists howled, even as Hearst protested that he wasn't
being underhanded. He said the search for the historic records was
simply designed to find out what his land was worth and to validate
those development rights with so-called "certificates of compliance."
Activists were not convinced. "They have been calculating and
coldblooded," said McConnell.</TE>
<TE>   Over the past year, Hearst negotiated in private with the Nature
Conservancy and Conservation Fund to come up with a new plan for the
ranch.</TE>
<TE>   That culminated in the release last week of a "framework" for an
agreement stating that Hearst would no longer pursue any development
on San Simeon Point. The only resort-type construction would be an
inn, possibly based on a recently discovered drawing by Julia Morgan,
the architect who designed Hearst Castle. The rest of the new plan
was devoted to creating an enclave for the Hearsts themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as negotiators try to complete the deal, skeptics are
demanding answers to these questions:</TE>
<TE>   * If this is such a good deal, why did negotiations with the
Nature Conservancy break down?</TE>
<TE>   When Hearst announced the new framework, the company said it had
stopped working with the Nature Conservancy and was now talking to
the American Land Conservancy. Hearst officials insisted they were
not shopping for a more malleable partner. But others said that if
that's true, why make the move? "I wonder what the American Land
Conservancy is going to be able to do that the Nature Conservancy
hasn't been able to do?" said Sam Schuchat, executive director of the
state Coastal Conservancy.</TE>
<TE>   * Should the Hearsts be allowed to hold on to beaches?</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of the deal point out that all 18 miles of the
beachfront are now private, so reserving a couple miles doesn't seem
so bad. But closing beaches is a sensitive issue in California, which
has been fighting to open beaches such as the one in front of David
Geffen's Malibu home. "I told them I was not very thrilled about
private beaches, not wanting to show up in Doonesbury," said
Schuchat.</TE>
<TE>   * Does Stephen Hearst have the authority to pull this off?</TE>
<TE>   Hearst has indicated he has all the power he needs to complete the
deal. But environmentalists think Hearst may simply be a stalking
horse for the real decision-makers in the Hearst corporation. When it
comes time to sign on the bottom line, they fear the big boys could
dump him. "It may be a good deal, but until Hearst [the corporation]
signs off, it's pretty worthless to speculate," McConnell said.</TE>
<TE>   * Where and how large will the private residences be?</TE>
<TE>   Just because Hearst has agreed that the family home sites will be
out of sight of travelers does not mean they won't have an impact on
the land and the animals who use it. Will each compound be on one, 10
or 100 acres? The difference matters in terms of infrastructure.
Also, since any development must go through the county's planning
process, will the Hearsts insist on an escape clause if planners try
to limit the size of the compounds?</TE>
<TE>   * How big will the inn be?</TE>
<TE>   Hearst calls it a "quaint inn," while others say a facility with
50 rooms is more hotel than B&amp;B. Still, it is a far cry from the
650-room hostelry previously proposed.</TE>

<HD>Rituals Tough to Mix, but Peace Is Plentiful at Interfaith
Event</HD>
<DH>The Triple Celebration for Christmas, Hanukkah and Ramadan
spreads familiarity of customs and beliefs in 3 faiths.</DH>

<LD>Call it a religious triple-header.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, for a second year, the National Conference for
Community &amp; Justice hosted its Triple Celebration -- an interfaith
observance of Christmas, Hanukkah and Ramadan.</LD>
<LD>   The event drew more than 300 to the Newport Beach Stake of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for an evening of
religious ceremonies and dinner.</LD>
<TE>   Sponsors said the event was widely attended because this year the
holidays fall in close proximity. The Muslim holy month of Ramadan
ends 11 days earlier each year and visits every month of the
calendar. This year it ended Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The event is aimed at fostering friendship and understanding among
religions -- a task that can sometimes turn awkward. Just planning
the dinner can get tricky.</TE>
<TE>   Each faith imposes its own dietary restrictions, and organizers
encountered a new wrinkle this year. Since the event was held in a
Mormon temple, meals could not include tea or coffee, which contain
caffeine. This caused a small controversy among lovers of those
beverages, said coordinator Shazeen Mufti. "We had to explain to
people that it would be the same as if we brought a ham into a mosque
or synagogue," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of dinner is also a matter of diplomacy. Last year, the
event fell during Ramadan, and Muslim participants fasted during
daylight hours. "Planning was difficult because they wanted to eat
right away -- they'd gone all day without food," Mufti said. "We
ended up having two dinners, one early one for the Muslims and a
second one later in the evening. That was tough."</TE>
<TE>   Other complications have less to do with faith. For example, as
Rabbi Rick Steinberg demonstrated a Havdalah ceremony -- a ritual
that marks the end of the Sabbath -- he was prevented from lighting a
braided candle traditionally extinguished by dipping it in a glass of
wine. "Due to fire codes, we're unable to light the candle tonight,"
Steinberg told onlookers .</TE>
<TE>   Despite such challenges, participants said they relished the
opportunity to share knowledge of their faiths.</TE>
<TE>   "For Muslims, it gives us an opportunity to come out and put a
face on our religion, rather than have someone else put a face on
it," said Imam Yassir Fazaga, of the Islamic Foundation of Orange
County.</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg, of Temple Shir Ha-Ma'alot in Irvine, said he too was
thankful for the chance to speak to adherents of other faiths. "I
want to talk about the most controversial part of Hanukkah," the
Rabbi told the audience. "That is: How is that darn thing spelled?"</TE>

<HD>Pearl Harbor Survivors Share Recollections of Day of Infamy</HD>
<DH>As their ranks dwindle, veterans seek to ensure that the
memory of Japanese attack doesn't fade away</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna and Holly J. Wolcott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As time depletes their ranks, the aged men in Hawaiian shirts and
white trousers are depending on children like 9-year-old Haleigh
Hallgrimson to ensure that the memory of the attack on Pearl Harbor
doesn't slip away.</LD>
<LD>   Haleigh, a bronze medal commemorating her grandfather's service
that day hanging from her neck, was the youngest attendee at an
Orange County memorial service Saturday commemorating the Japanese
divebombing and strafing of the U.S. naval base.</LD>
<LD>   "Most veterans are reticent about talking about the war," said
Andrew Weniger, 80, of Huntington Beach, who was an Army private at a
base adjacent to Pearl Harbor. "But we owe it to those who didn't
survive to make sure that younger generations know our stories, so
they can pass them on after we're gone."</LD>
<TE>   The observance at El Toro Memorial Park in Lake Forest drew about
70 people for a ceremony punctuated by bagpipe renditions of the
national anthem and "Amazing Grace," and survivors' recollections.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, two World War II fighter planes buzzed overhead
in a show of patriotic support as survivors took turns on an outdoor
stage sharing details of the day that America was attacked 61 years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We were awakened with some of the most awful percussion and
sounds we ever heard," said 82-year-old Solomon Jackson of Ventura, a
former Marine who was stationed at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.</TE>
<TE>   After convincing his bunkmate that they were under fire, Jackson
grabbed a rifle, ran outside and, along with other Marines, started
shooting at a kamikaze flying low overhead. "He went down in the
water. He was really riddled," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   A small group of residents and political leaders gathered under
blue skies at the Ventura County Veterans Memorial to hear the oral
histories.</TE>
<TE>   All sat rapt as Jackson reached the end of his recollections.</TE>
<TE>   The aftermath of the attack, he said, was a sea of bodies floating
in the harbor, many of them on fire. "It was a horrible sight," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   At the service in Lake Forest, Frank Weitzel, his yellow satin
Pearl Harbor Survivors Assn. jacket glinting in the noon sun, said it
saddens him to see the number of veterans attending the ceremony
shrink.</TE>
<TE>   "This organization is slowly dying off," said the 80-year-old
Huntington Beach resident, who was aboard the Navy cruiser San
Francisco when Pearl Harbor was attacked. "I come every year because
these are the only people who truly understand what it was like to be
there that day."</TE>
<TE>   As the survivors die, he said, it becomes increasingly crucial to
make sure younger generations have at least some sense of the day's
events and its impact on history. Weitzel and others in the Los
Alamitos chapter of the survivors' group visit local high school
history classes to talk about their experiences.</TE>
<TE>   For Haleigh, wearing the medal and attending the observance each
year is a way to remember her grandfather, Clarence James Martin, who
was on board the battleship Pennsylvania during the bombing. "It must
have been tough work for him to survive," Haleigh said.</TE>
<TE>   "She doesn't yet understand what war is," Jeannie Hallgrimson said
after the ceremony, a cap emblazoned with the Pearl Harbors Survivors
Assn. insignia nestled in her lap.</TE>
<TE>   "But she understands that her grandfather and the others at Pearl
Harbor that day did something that deserves to be remembered."</TE>

<HD>Richard Lazarus, 80; Studied the Effects of Stress</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claudia Luther</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Psychologist Richard S. Lazarus, who died on Nov. 24 at the age of 80
following a fall, sometimes quoted Shakespeare in trying to explain
his research into the effects of stress: "For there is nothing either
good or bad, but thinking makes it so."</LD>
<LD>   What was so for Hamlet, Lazarus came to believe, was so for the
rest of us.</LD>
<LD>   As Lazarus, the author of 13 books and professor emeritus at UC
Berkeley, put it more academically, stress is "neither an
environmental stimulus, a characteristic of the person, nor a
response but a relationship between demands and the power to deal
with them without unreasonable or destructive costs."</LD>
<TE>   Much of our stress is, in other words, not a matter of the
magnitude of the problems we face, but of our ability -- and our
assessment of that ability -- to handle them. If our coping
mechanisms are adequate, we experience minimum stress. If they're
not, we stress out.</TE>
<TE>   And he was not just talking about the big problems.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, Lazarus used the phrase "daily hassles" to describe
life's quotidian stresses, which he came to believe were a better
predictor of stress reactions and health problems than major life
events.</TE>
<TE>   He said that such worries -- about weight, a loved one's illness,
tension with a work colleague, traffic jams or even relentless house
chores -- could affect a person's blood pressure or cause other
physical symptoms, such as chest pain or asthma attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Other researchers took it further, saying that the more upset we
feel about day-to-day hassles, the more vulnerable we are to
infections and perhaps even more serious illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   "You can argue about the findings with cancer, but with infection
the evidence is very strong," Lazarus told the Toronto Star in 1996.
"If you are an inept coper or a person who overreacts, then your
stress level will be higher and so will your risk of infectious
illness."</TE>
<TE>   Lazarus also discovered that a little denial could go a long way.
In one study, he demonstrated that patients who engage in forms of
denial -- refusing to believe that a serious medical problem exists
or refusing to accept that it is as bad as it seems -- recover better
and more quickly from surgery than other patients.</TE>
<TE>   He thus came to believe that false beliefs can sometimes have very
beneficial consequences for one's health and well-being, and also
that a person's illness or other situation is only part of the story
-- that medical professionals needed to take the emotional and
physiological reactions into account.</TE>
<TE>   Lazarus wrote 13 books, including "Emotion and Adaptation," which
explained that a single response, such as a smile, can be used for
different emotions and that different responses, such as retaliation
and passive aggressiveness, can be used in service of the same
emotion.</TE>
<TE>   Lazarus won a Guggenheim Fellowship and in 1989 was awarded the
Distinguished Scientific Contribution to Psychology Award from the
American Psychological Assn. He joined the Berkeley faculty in 1957
after graduating from City College of New York and receiving his
doctorate from the University of Pittsburgh. Before moving to
Berkeley, he taught at Johns Hopkins University and Clark University.</TE>
<TE>   Lazarus died in Walnut Creek, Calif., where he resided with his
wife of 57 years, Bernice. She survives him, as do two children and
four grandchildren.</TE>

<LD>The news, quite frankly, is shocking.</LD>
<LD>   I was chatting with a chap from USC's Center on Philanthropy and
Public Policy and learned that in Los Angeles, charitable giving is
"less robust than in other major cities."</LD>
<LD>   For shame.</LD>
<TE>   Every Monday morning, the big news is the $50 million raked in by
the lucky studio of the week. The median home price in Malibu is $2
million. And there's no shortage of self-congratulatory do-gooders
spouting pinko politics from behind mansion gates.</TE>
<TE>   So where's the giving?</TE>
<TE>   In its rags and riches report, the United Way said nearly 18% of
L.A. County lives in poverty.</TE>
<TE>   I bring up this subject because with your help, maybe we can get
the aforementioned tightwads off the dime, so to speak.</TE>
<TE>   All you have to do is bang out a little ditty and donate $5 or
more to the L.A. Times Holiday Campaign (details above), which
supports a wide range of charities throughout Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The author of the best verse will win fame (your name published
here) and fortune (dinner at the Los Tacos between the 7-Eleven and
the carwash in West Hollywood).</TE>
<TE>   All ditties must be written to the tune of "We Three Kings," and
to get you in the mood, I'm going to pen a few lines myself.</TE>
<TE>   Are you ready?</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A plan to reopen a scaled-down Museum of Flying at a new Santa Monica
Airport location appears to be, um, taking flight.</LD>
<LD>   The museum shut its hangar doors in July after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks sent insurance premiums soaring, forcing museum
officials to ground their fleet. Local airplane enthusiasts feared
that the museum would move to another Southern California community.</LD>
<LD>   Enter Supermarine, an aviation service provider that had subleased
space to the museum. It is floating a plan for Volkswagen of America
to relocate its North American Design Studios from Simi Valley to the
museum's old digs.</LD>
<TE>   The plan calls for the museum to reopen at a hangar that
Supermarine also controls, across a ramp from the museum's former
location.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Trimborn, manager for Santa Monica Airport, said he is pleased
with the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of historic events that happened here," he said.
"The first aircraft to circumnavigate the Earth departed from this
airport in the early 1920s."</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Monica City Council is scheduled to vote Dec. 17 whether
to amend Supermarine's lease with the city to allow a design studio.
Volkswagen officials want to sublease roughly 44,000 square feet from
Supermarine for about 12 years as a base for about 50 employees.</TE>
<TE>   If the deal goes through, the museum would reopen in a
12,000-square-foot space -- slightly more than a quarter of the size
of its previous location.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Ryan, vice president and executive director of the museum,
said the smaller space will require reduced flight operations. Many
aircraft, he added, will be loaned to other museums on a rotating
basis.</TE>
<TE>   Those museums will cover the planes' insurance and maintenance
while they are on loan.</TE>
<TE>   "Our revenue streams wouldn't support our old operations," Ryan
said. "We knew we needed to scale back."</TE>
<TE>   The new location includes a 6,800-square-foot hangar, 1,200 square
feet of office space and a 4,000-square-foot ramp that will be used
to display aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The museum opened in 1989 and housed about 35 fighter planes and
artifacts, including a bell rung on the battleship Arizona when it
was attacked by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor.</TE>

<HD>Sue Okabe, 74; Vocalist, Influential Music Teacher</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sue Okabe, an influential music teacher and vocalist whose earliest
performances are part of the history of Japanese Americans'
involvement in popular American music during World War II, died of
lung cancer Nov. 28 at her Gardena home. She was 74.</LD>
<LD>   Okabe was a classically trained vocalist who was interned at the
Minidoka Relocation Center in central Idaho during the war. Later, as
a piano and voice teacher in Gardena for more than four decades, she
trained many vocalists and musicians, and supported musical and other
arts events in the Asian American community.</LD>
<LD>   In September, about three months after she was diagnosed with
advanced lung cancer, more than 800 people attended a sold-out
tribute to her at the Japan America Theatre in downtown Los Angeles'
Little Tokyo. The musical program was produced by an all-volunteer
cast and crew of nearly 100, many of whom were former students.</LD>
<TE>   Okabe was one of a small number of Japanese Americans who made a
living performing popular music after the war, when discrimination
severely limited their opportunities in most fields. She supported
her two children by singing jazz tunes in Los Angeles-area bars and
nightclubs for several years in the late 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   "She was one of very few people who used the idiom of jazz and pop
singing as an occupational base -- to pay her bills," said musician
and historian George Yoshida, who interviewed Okabe for his book
"Reminiscing in Swingtime: Japanese Americans in American Popular
Music, 1925-1960," published in 1997 by the Japanese American
Historical Society.</TE>
<TE>   Okabe was born in Seattle and began classical voice training when
she was 8. In 1942, a few months after the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor, the federal government ordered more than 100,000 Americans of
Japanese descent on the West Coast into 10 internment camps. Okabe,
then 13, and her family were sent to Minidoka, erected in a desolate
desert region northeast of Twin Falls, Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   Her singing talent soon caught the attention of camp
administrators. Unlike most internees, Okabe was allowed to regularly
venture beyond Minidoka's barbed-wire confines to perform at local
Rotary and Lions clubs, accompanied on piano by her sister, Michi.</TE>
<TE>   Okabe remained at the camp for about a year until a sponsor in
Colorado made it possible for her family to leave. While in high
school in Denver, she was again singled out for her vocal talent and
chosen to join a local USO group. Soon she was performing at war-bond
rallies and USO centers in Colorado, Wyoming and Nebraska, belting
out such hit tunes of the era as "Begin the Beguine" and "Say a
Prayer for the Boys Over There."</TE>
<TE>   She was 15 and too young, her daughter Lisa Joe said, to
appreciate the irony of an "enemy alien" entertaining American GIs.</TE>
<TE>   "My teacher thought it was a good idea, especially in my position
of being Japanese," Okabe recently told an interviewer for the Los
Angeles Rafu Shimpo newspaper. "I thought nothing of it until that
one war-bond rally when people in Wyoming started to yell, 'Get the
Chink off the stage' or 'Send the Jap back.' "</TE>
<TE>   As the only nonwhite and minor in her USO troupe, Okabe was so
unhappy that she ran away from home and took a train back to
Minidoka, where she had many friends. ("I'm probably the only person
who ran away from home and into camp," she joked.) But her stay was
cut short when her mother arrived to take her home.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Okabe moved with her family to Los Angeles, where
she continued to perform at community events -- mainly funerals for
members of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, the highly decorated,
all-Nisei combat force.</TE>
<TE>   She earned a degree in English from USC and taught school for a
few years. After her divorce from her first husband in 1958, she
found steady work singing jazz in local nightclubs and restaurants.
The high point of her career was landing the lead in a 1963 Long
Beach Civic Light Opera production of "Flower Drum Song," the Rodgers
and Hammerstein musical that broke ground with its mainstream
portrayals of Asian Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Okabe began teaching music full time at her home in the 1950s,
later shifting lessons to a music store she ran in Gardena with her
daughter. Her knowledge of the popular music performed and enjoyed by
Japanese Americans during the internment years led to her serving as
a consultant on several shows about their wartime experiences.</TE>
<TE>   "She was an inspiration to me," said Scott Nagatani, a musical
director for the East-West Players who helped organize the September
tribute to Okabe.</TE>
<TE>   "My fondest memory is playing jazz with her at a bar in
Chinatown," he said. "She was singing jazz with us, staying out until
2 in the morning. You don't see too many Nisei women like that.</TE>
<TE>   "She was very supportive of musicians and singers," he added.
"That's one reason why 800 people showed up for her tribute."</TE>
<TE>   Okabe was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer in the spring.
Although she was a heavy smoker most of her life, she had a form of
the cancer not found in smokers, her daughter said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her daughter, of Gardena, and her sister Elsie
Michi Dohzen of Torrance, Okabe is survived by her husband of 36
years, Kenichi, of Gardena; a son, Randal of Carlsbad; another
sister, Martha Kay Suyetsugu of Los Angeles; and three grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>In Crime, We're Nowhere Near L.A.</HD>

<LD>The news from Los Angeles is dispiriting, isn't it? What should be
trumpeted as one of the world's great cities -- blessed by climate
and aesthetics and natural resources -- instead is being talked of as
a "murder capital" and accepting of a subculture of crime that
seemingly can't be stemmed.</LD>
<LD>   Some native Orange Countians or L.A. transplants may take private
satisfaction from the grim crime statistics that have the new L.A.
police chief growling, but let's hope not.</LD>
<LD>   No, we shouldn't gloat, even though many O.C. residents fancy
themselves as the anti-L.A. -- a society that hasn't slid to the
depths as have some parts of the city but 30 miles away.</LD>
<TE>   But you know what? They're right.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Police Chief William Bratton's angry and anguished pilgrimage
last week to its crime-infested neighborhoods seems completely
foreign to Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   That foreignness is to be celebrated.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't to say that Orange County has solved urban (or
suburban) violence.</TE>
<TE>   The county has gangs and murders and all other crimes-- but on
nowhere near the scale of L.A. County.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Orange County reported 8,560 violent crimes, according to
figures from the state attorney general's office.</TE>
<TE>   That year, Los Angeles County reported 89,800 violent crimes --
easily more than 10 times the Orange County total -- even though the
report put L.A. County's population at not quite 3 1/2 times that of
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, L.A. County recorded 1,070 homicides; Orange County 63.
You don't need me to do the arithmetic to make the point. The
statistics dovetail with a question in the annual Orange County
Survey released last week, asking residents to identify the most
important issues facing them.</TE>
<TE>   Concern about crime and gangs came in sixth, behind issues like
traffic, housing and education.</TE>
<TE>   Latino respondents were more likely than whites to identify it as
a problem, but the issue was listed as the top concern by only 5% of
the 2,000 respondents.</TE>
<TE>   Survey director Mark Baldassare says, "The difference between
Orange County and L.A. is that Orange County has never gone through a
period where gangs and street crimes were at the kind of crisis stage
we've seen from time to time in L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has more people and neighborhoods "historically
subject" to the crimes-drugs-gangs combination, Baldassare says.</TE>
<TE>   But another critical difference has been Orange County's ability
to sustain its economy.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm struck by what L.A. is going through now," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always felt in the 20 years I've had experience with Orange
County, the thing about crime is that people are on the lookout for
it and it's a manageable issue. There isn't one big city police
bureaucracy, but there are a number of police agencies, plus the
county, and they all seem to work pretty well together. They
coordinate in ways that I always found impressive."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, he adds, "There are a lot of places in this state
where people do feel crime is at a crisis stage, but nobody knows
what to do with it. Oakland is like that now."</TE>
<TE>   The modern-era Orange County challenge has been to transform
itself into a thriving metropolis while not succumbing to the
attendant perils of big-city crime.</TE>
<TE>   My bottom line this morning is that, at this point in history, the
county can pat itself on the back for a job (relatively) well done.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it also should send a heartfelt prayer to the City of
Angels up the road.</TE>

<HD>Local Survivors Remember a Day of Infamy</HD>
<DH>Residents gather at Ventura County Veterans Memorial to
hear oral histories from men who lived through Pearl Harbor attack.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As two World War II fighter planes buzzed overhead in a show of
patriotic support, Ventura County's Pearl Harbor survivors took turns
on an outdoor stage Saturday sharing eerie details of the day that
America was attacked 61 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   "We were awakened with some of the most awful percussion and
sounds we ever heard," said Solomon Jackson, 82, of Ventura, a Marine
who was stationed at the Hawaiian port on Dec. 7, 1941.</LD>
<LD>   After convincing his bunkmate they were under fire, Jackson
grabbed a rifle, ran outside and, along with other Marines, started
shooting at a low-flying Japanese plane. "He went down in the water.
He was really riddled," Jackson said.</LD>
<TE>   A small group of residents and political leaders gathered at the
Ventura County Veterans Memorial in Ventura to hear the oral
histories. All sat rapt as Jackson reached the end of his
recollections.</TE>
<TE>   The aftermath of the attack, he said, was a sea of dead floating
in the harbor, many of the bodies on fire. "It was a horrible sight."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson was one of five survivors to speak at the anniversary
ceremony, which also included brief remarks by county Supervisor John
K. Flynn and spokesmen for Rep. Elton Gallegly and state Sen. Tom
McClintock.</TE>
<TE>   Former sailor Ed Baumgart of Meiners Oaks, who said he was trapped
for 23 hours inside the Oklahoma after the battleship capsized during
the attack, told the crowd that his best friend was buried at Pearl
Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always wanted to be there on a Dec. 7, to go out to the USS
Arizona, but it's too late for that now," said Baumgart, 81. "I'm an
old man and I'm lucky to be here."</TE>
<TE>   Navy veteran Bob Guyll, also 81 and of Ventura, asked the audience
never to forget the sacrifice made by military personnel at the start
of the war.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thinking of all those fellows we lost during those terrible
years," Guyll said while standing at the microphone, which was
flanked by large cardboard displays of newspaper stories and photos
of the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn said he was 8 and visiting his grandmother's house off
Ventura Avenue when word of the attack arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "We are so thankful to the survivors," Flynn said. "We love each
of you and are so thankful for what you did."</TE>
<TE>   More than 2,400 sailors and soldiers were killed, along with about
50 civilians. Hundreds more were injured.</TE>
<TE>   Several couples brought their young children to hear firsthand
accounts of American history.</TE>
<TE>   "Pearl Harbor Day, much like Sept. 11, is a day that will be
remembered by all," Gallegly spokesman Brian Miller said.</TE>

<HD>Juveniles Escape Own Crime Tales on Stage</HD>
<DH>Detained youths work with professionals to produce a play,
which many say helps keep their minds off the next court hearing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Chavez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They stood proud on their makeshift stage, 20 boys who had just
finished performing in their first drama production. Raising their
hands, they took one deep bow and for a brief moment soaked up the
cheers and a standing ovation that the small audience had awarded.</LD>
<LD>   And then the young actors exited stage right: single file with
hands clasped behind their backs, walking through four locked gates,
past a 22-foot wall topped with barbed wire and back into Unit K/L of
Central Juvenile Hall near downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   What unfolded Saturday afternoon inside the shabby chapel of the
detention facility was an unusual act of teamwork performed by a
group of juveniles charged with crimes ranging from murder to assault
to burglary. As they move through the juvenile justice system, they
attend high school classes and go to court hearings. Those with good
behavior get a chance to join a theater group.</LD>
<TE>   Guided by professional writers, actors and producers with a small
nonprofit group called the Unusual Suspects Theater Company, the boys
both wrote and acted in the nine-scene play.</TE>
<TE>   But this was no merry holiday performance.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they called their play "The School of Hard Knocks" and
filled it with characters with street names like Blizzard, Cool
Breeze, Tantrum and No Good.</TE>
<TE>   The plot involved a bomb-toting student who threatens to blow up
their dilapidated high school because of a dispute with two gang
leaders who have threatened him.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the factions agree to "all get along." The bomb-maker
reveals that his device is a fake and that he pulled the prank to
force people to unite and overcome a problem -- but not before
extracting an agreement from the principal for new books, desks,
hoops and waxed classroom floors.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the boys said they signed up for the production to
break the monotony of their rigid schedule and to take their minds
off what obsesses them most: their next court hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "We always got orders .... We got three minutes to shower, can
only go to the bathroom when we are told. This was a way to get my
mind off court," said Edward, 16, who has been charged with burglary.</TE>
<TE>   "Not murder, like me," said another boy, listening in on the
conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Michael Nash, presiding judge of the Juvenile
Court, issued a special order allowing for a limited waiver of
confidentiality laws to allow guests to attend the play.</TE>
<TE>   Under conditions of the order, the youths could not be identified.
Also, officials prohibited the boys from discussing specifics of
their cases.</TE>
<TE>   About 30 people, mainly supporters of the theater group and
detention facility staffers, attended. Guests passed through metal
detectors, had their belongings searched and were escorted to their
seats by security personnel. As the boys performed, several staff
members constantly scanned the group, counting heads.</TE>
<TE>   "I invited my mother and attorney," one boy said. "I'm hoping they
come tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   A second 16-year-old Edward was bold enough to volunteer to play a
girl cheerleader named Diamond, who in a subplot spurns a gang-member
boyfriend for a poetry writer named Theo. Diamond, in her miniskirt
uniform (with county-issued gray pants underneath) stuffed bra and
wig, got big laughs during the show.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to keep my mind straight from all the negativity,
relieves the stress about my case," said Edward, who imitated a
firing gun with his hand when he said he has been charged with
"attempted 187," the penal code number for murder.</TE>
<TE>   Dion, 16, who helped write and played the lead character, Simon,
the fake bomb-maker, said he wanted the play to have a positive
message, despite the surroundings and his own circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "My case is going downhill," he said of the charges against him:
assault and making a terrorist threat. "You know when you're here
that society is rejecting you. But when we get out, we should have
improved ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   In one scene, the characters complain to their principal about
poor school conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a broke school, which means we are in a broke
neighborhood. How are we supposed to even get our own [school]
supplies?" a character named Tantrum said.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteer Cindy Chupack, a writer and executive producer for HBO's
"Sex and the City," said she coached the youths but did not rewrite
their scripts. She has been volunteering twice a week since October.
"We just can't forget about them because they are locked up.... It's
easy to think of them as monsters, as not our kids, but they are our
kids."</TE>
<TE>   Volunteer Lisa Lindstrom, who produced "Fried Green Tomatoes,"
said she lends her time because "obviously, I believe in
rehabilitation." She said she represents the other side of the
"lock-them-up-and-put-them-away" philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   "I have found if you give them a chance to use their minds and
work on something dignified as human beings, they can rise to that,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   But the rough production that used a few battered chairs and
homemade posters for props and was performed on the chapel altar, had
been hit with last-minute turnovers. Friday, two players were
inexplicably pulled from the production.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't' know what happened," said one volunteer. Most likely he
got in a fight or some other kind of trouble, said a detention
facility official.</TE>

<HD>Debating Nuclear Risk at Landfills</HD>
<DH>Critics decry dumping of mildly radioactive material in
California's municipal dumps. State officials say there's no evidence
of a threat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Miguel Bustillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For at least a decade, California has allowed mildly radioactive
waste from old nuclear sites to go to recycling plants and city dumps
not licensed to handle radioactive material of any type.</LD>
<LD>   Yet neither landfill owners nor their employees, nearby residents
nor elected officials, were ever notified of the state's policy,
details of which are only now becoming public after a lawsuit and
questions from concerned state lawmakers.</LD>
<LD>   Anti-nuclear activists, environmental groups and others are
demanding to know more about where the state has allowed the waste --
mostly soil, concrete and metal with residual traces of radiation --
to be disposed of.</LD>
<TE>   But the California Department of Health Services contends that it
did not keep detailed records on slightly radioactive trash because
officials never considered it contaminated enough to pose a health
hazard.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of public fear and concern about anything
radioactive; it's a polarizing issue," said the deputy director of
the Health Services Department, Kevin Reilly. But the slightly
radioactive trash, he said, "does not pose a significant health risk.
And it is not just California's opinion; it is a near-universal
opinion within the scientific community.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get down to low levels, you don't have any scientific
evidence to suggest they are a threat, especially when you take into
account the ability of the human body to repair itself," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Experts disagree on whether exposure to the material -- mostly
debris from old buildings where radioactive experiments took place --
is a serious health risk. Under current state standards, it can be
the equivalent of 2 1/2 chest X-rays a year.</TE>
<TE>   But standards were much looser in previous years, and state
officials concede that waste from some older nuclear sites might have
been as much as 20 times as radioactive as the maximum the state
would consider safe today.</TE>
<TE>   The danger is greatest for those who live or work near the waste
and are more likely than others to be exposed to it repeatedly.</TE>
<TE>   And even though they insist that the waste is harmless, state
attorneys refuse to release records on its likely sources -- the more
than 1,400 former nuclear sites that the state has released from
oversight in the last 15 years -- because of post-Sept. 11 concerns
that terrorists might be trying to collect radioactive materials for
a "dirty bomb."</TE>
<TE>   State legislators and environmental groups alarmed by the dumping
had hoped to examine the inventory of sites to determine the danger
for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   They criticized the state's decision to keep the information
private, saying it raises troubling questions about the nature of the
radioactive junk that might have been shipped from the sites. The
state claimed to have decommissioned the sites only after they were
cleaned up to safe levels.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so safe we can sprinkle it on your children's cereal, but we
can't tell you about it because Osama bin Laden might want to use it
to make a bomb to blow up Los Angeles? There's a bit of a disconnect
there," said Daniel Hirsch of the anti-nuclear Committee to Bridge
the Gap. He noted that the old sites were supposedly cleaned up to
safe levels before the state unconditionally released them from
oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Gov. Gray Davis' administration is moving forward with
new guidelines to allow at least some dumping and recycling to
continue. The new plans are needed because a judge ruled earlier this
year that the first formal regulations California adopted to permit
the practice last year, well after it was already underway, violated
the state's own laws.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling concluded that California had not followed proper
procedures -- by failing to consider stricter alternatives -- before
enacting the new regulations.</TE>
<TE>   The unregulated disposal practices went on as California sought
unsuccessfully to establish a dump to receive low-level nuclear waste
in Ward Valley in the Mojave Desert.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of the Ward Valley facility, the state did not
prohibit the routine disposal of mildly radioactive waste. As a
result, state officials acknowledge, mildly radioactive trash has
ended up in municipal landfills and might even have been recycled.</TE>
<TE>   For private companies and government agencies with stockpiles of
radioactive junk, there was a substantial financial incentive to take
advantage of the state's policy and send at least some radioactive
waste to local landfills.</TE>
<TE>   It is far more expensive to ship radioactive trash to one of the
nation's few licensed nuclear repositories. High-level waste, such as
spent fuel rods from nuclear power plants, is required by federal law
to go to licensed nuclear waste landfills.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in his political career, Davis cited safety reasons for
opposing the Ward Valley dump, which was to be a repository for most
of California's radioactive waste. So, environmentalists were
perplexed this fall when, as governor, he vetoed legislation that
would have banned dumping in ordinary landfills.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' veto reflected the concerns of nuclear energy and
biotechnology firms, which would have had to spend millions more to
dispose of radioactive waste at licensed nuclear dumps if the measure
had become law.</TE>
<TE>   State officials concede that some of the mildly radioactive trash
probably would have gone to Ward Valley if that dump had been allowed
to open. But they insist that most of what they are allowing to go to
landfills or recyclers is so slightly contaminated that they never
would have ordered it to go to a licensed nuclear facility.</TE>
<TE>   Many nuclear scientists agree with state officials that the levels
of radioactivity in the trash are insignificant compared with the
radiation Americans are exposed to every day in other ways. They call
the issue a classic example of the public's lack of knowledge of
radiation's true health risks.</TE>
<TE>   Exposure to radiation is commonly measured in units called
millirems; average Americans are exposed to 360 millirems of
radioactivity in a lifetime. The state's current policy, they note,
allows for release of radioactive trash only at levels of 25
millirems or lower. Exposure to 25 millirems is the equivalent of 2
1/2 chest X-rays a year.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, working in a granite-encrusted building such as the
state Capitol, for example, can produce similar exposure to low
levels of radiation, because the stone contains traces of uranium and
thorium.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, a routine cross-country flight exposes passengers to
small levels of radiation from cosmic rays, as does living in a
high-altitude city such as Denver. Even sleeping next to another
person can increase exposure, because humans emit tiny levels of
radiation after eating foods such as bananas which contain potassium,
they note.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is very much overblown," said Alan Pasternak of the
California Radioactive Materials Management Forum, an industry group.
"Concerns about very small levels of radioactivity going to landfills
need some government guidance. But if you want to limit all
radioactivity, you had better start with cemeteries, because the dead
have detectable levels of radiation."</TE>
<TE>   Anti-nuclear activists, some of them scientists who have worked in
the nuclear industry, disagree. They say all radioactive waste should
go to licensed nuclear dumps. Though 2 1/2 X-rays may not sound like
much, they say some federal studies have determined that repeated
exposure to 25 millirems can lead to death from cancer in one out of
every 1,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   They contend that it is difficult, if not impossible, for the
state to accurately determine the level of radioactivity of the
contaminated junk in question, given its current oversight policies,
and they fear that radioactive material that is hotter than the
permitted level is going into local dumps.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, they point out that what scientists considered safe
exposures to radiation two decades ago are no longer considered safe,
and that the radioactive material, even if it is considered harmless
today, could be deemed harmful in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen years ago, for example, California unconditionally
released old nuclear sites from regulation at radiation levels as
high as 500 millirems -- 20 times as high as what it currently
considers safe.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the important point, because the history of radiation
regulation is that these permissible levels have been getting lower
and lower," said Hirsch of the Committee to Bridge the Gap, who also
was director of the Adlai Stevenson Program on Nuclear Policy at UC
Santa Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   California, state officials argue, has simply been following
safety standards set by the federal government and is not alone among
states in allowing slightly radioactive trash to go to landfills not
licensed to handle nuclear waste. Most of the state-licensed sites in
question, they note, were small research labs that generated little
if any truly hazardous radioactive waste.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the federal panel the
state cites as its model for regulation, has been struggling with the
issue of mildly radioactive material for years.</TE>
<TE>   A plan it unveiled to deregulate waste that was deemed "below
regulatory concern" was struck down by Congress a decade ago amid
public fears of recycled radioactive forks and hip replacements.
Moreover, another arm of the federal government, the Environmental
Protection Agency, recommends more restrictive policies than the NRC.</TE>
<TE>   Revelations that California has allowed the dumping of radioactive
waste at local landfills surfaced two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   That was when officials confirmed in writing to Sen. Barbara Boxer
(D-Calif.) and state Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica) that
shipments of slightly radioactive material from the former Santa
Susana Field Laboratory, a rocket-testing ground between the Simi and
San Fernando valleys, had been sent to the Sunshine Canyon Landfill
in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Susana, the site of numerous rocket experiments after Word
War II, had a partial meltdown of uranium fuel rods in 1959.
According to officials, waste from Santa Susana also was sent to the
Bradley Landfill in Sun Valley and to a metal recycler on Terminal
Island.</TE>
<TE>   Government health officials and representatives from Boeing's
Rocketdyne division, the site's owner, tried to assure the public
that the trash was safe. But local residents wonder why no one was
notified.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe them," said Kim Thompson, a member of Los
Angeles' Environmental Affairs Commission who lives near Sunshine
Canyon. "Some people say everything has some level of radioactivity
in it, but I have to believe that what came from Rocketdyne is
worse."</TE>
<TE>   State officials have so far refused to release a full accounting
of how much of the radioactive waste has been dumped around the state
and where it came from. They told legislators earlier this year that
such a list would take four years to compile. More recently,
officials have indicated that detailed dumping data do not exist.</TE>
<TE>   The financial stakes behind the dumping issue are huge.</TE>
<TE>   A study by the National Academy of Sciences found that, in the
next three decades, decommissioning of old nuclear sites around the
country will generate 740,000 metric tons of slightly radioactive
metal and as much as 12 million tons of concrete.</TE>
<TE>   If that material is sent to licensed nuclear dumps, the study
concluded, the cost could reach $11.7 billion. If it is placed in
ordinary landfills, it could cost as little as $300 million -- or
maybe nothing if the price could be offset by revenue from recycling.</TE>
<TE>   California's only two working nuclear power plants -- Diablo
Canyon in Central California and San Onofre near San Clemente -- are
to be decommissioned in the next three decades.</TE>
<TE>   Davis followed his veto of the legislation by state Sen. Gloria
Romero (D-Los Angeles) with a partial moratorium on dumping that
prevents disposal of radioactive waste at most landfills.</TE>
<TE>   However, it does not prevent recycling or dumping of slightly
radioactive dirt at farms or anywhere else. Also, it still allows
dumping at more than 20 sites, including the Chiquita Canyon Landfill
in Los Angeles County and the Simi Valley Landfill in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Romero, still upset over the veto, is preparing legislation for
next year to restrict disposal of all radioactive waste. Frustrated
by the state's actions, she and other lawmakers are also debating
whether to move the state office responsible for the dumping policy
out of the Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   "I am most disappointed with this department," she said.</TE>

<CX>   Radioactive waste -- An article in the California section Sunday on
radioactive waste incorrectly stated the amount of radioactivity that
Americans are commonly exposed to in everyday life. They are exposed
to roughly 360 millirems every year, rather than during their
lifetimes as the story stated.</CX>

<HD>The Thrill of the Film Pulls New Wave of Surfers Into
Theaters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Reyes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been years since the old Surf Theatre was torn down, but
Huntington Beach residents like Dave Carlos still recall the
emotional rush they felt sitting inside the downtown movie house as
their favorite surfers slashed across the big screen riding perfect
green waves.</LD>
<LD>   It was a visceral, shared experience for young surfers who packed
the theater in the 1960s and '70s to watch "surfumentaries" such as
"Pacific Vibrations" and "Five Summer Stories."</LD>
<LD>   "I was a little kid and any time some guy in the movie would carve
a wave, we would scream and yell and hoot, loving every minute of
it," Carlos said.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the old theaters that catered to the surf crowd have
closed or shifted to more mainstream fare, and present-day
surfumentaries are now released almost exclusively on video or DVD.</TE>
<TE>   But Carlos -- who at 38 still structures his life around riding
waves -- is hoping to reignite the excitement that having a local
cinema for surf films once meant to thousands of young wave riders
from San Diego to Santa Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Carlos, a telemarketer, put up $6,000 to rent the
Mann's Pierside Pavilion theater and promote a revival of the surf
movie experience. On the bill was "Burning the Map," a documentary
featuring 21-year-old Timmy Turner, a popular local surfer who
starred in and helped direct his own coming-of-age film with
Indonesia's incredible waves as a backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos was concerned that he might not recoup his investment, but,
it turned out, he needn't have worried. The 400-seat theater sold out
-- at $8.75 a seat -- and excited viewers, including Turner's
parents, relatives and friends, gave Carlos a standing ovation. A
second show was also packed.</TE>
<TE>   "They're bringing back that spirit," said an excited Sean Thomas,
39, whose family owned the Surf Theatre when it was home base for the
beach crowd.</TE>
<TE>   With the night's success now past, Carlos said he has heard from
theater owners and filmmakers from Laguna Niguel to Ventura to
Hawaii, all wondering whether a new wave of interest in surf films is
building. The next show in Huntington Beach is Thursday, when "The
Kill 6," a local effort from Santa Barbara filmmaker Josh Pomer, will
be shown.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos said he is cautiously optimistic that he has tapped into a
sense of community that surfers seek.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most vivid memories for Southern California surfers
from the baby-boom generation was accompanying friends to see the
latest surf movie by Bruce Brown or Hal Jepsen at places such as the
Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, La Paloma Theater in Encinitas, and
the Magic Lantern Theater in Santa Barbara. Only the La Paloma still
specializes in surf films.</TE>
<TE>   "It was electric," said Drew Kampion, the former editor of Surfer
magazine who wrote the narration for "Five Summer Stories."</TE>
<TE>   The movie houses provided what was then the only venue for the
pioneer makers of surfing films. And, surfers, usually just by word
of mouth, always seemed to find out who was coming to town, and when.</TE>
<TE>   For Kampion, it was Brown's seminal surf film "Endless Summer"
that kick-started his love affair with the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   He remembers standing in line outside the Santa Monica Civic
Auditorium on what seemed a perfect afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "The place was just mobbed, and it was extreme and everyone was
there. It delivered on so many levels that my imagination ... it was
one of the clearest memories in my mind. I remember Robert August and
Mike Hynson riding those waves at Cape St. Francis."</TE>
<TE>   It was just as important to be there as it was to watch what was
on the screen, Carlos said.</TE>
<TE>   Being there gave young surfers -- many of whom were still learning
to ride waves -- a sense that they were part of the California surf
scene, said Chris Brewster, 47, who recently retired as lifeguard
chief for San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference between going to a surf movie at the La Paloma and
going to a cineplex is that you knew everyone else there shared your
passion," said Brewster, who used to hitchhike from San Diego to
Encinitas to catch the latest offering.</TE>
<TE>   For some, the movie house gathering left strong and lasting
memories.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Rambeau, a Santa Monica city employee, recalled the communal
feeling of watching "Endless Summer" at the civic auditorium in San
Gabriel.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Councilwoman Donna Frye, who is married to surfer and
surfboard shaper Skip Frye, recalled the fun evenings she spent as a
youth watching surf movies. "If they're trying to revive the old
spirit, it's a great idea," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "You followed the movies wherever they were going to play.
Sometimes it was at the Roxy in Pacific Beach. I remember when
"Endless Summer" came out and it didn't have any sound and Bruce
Brown toured with it," Frye said. "He would take a microphone and
narrate the film adding his own humor as he went along."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Roper, 44, has fond memories of grabbing his friends on a
Friday and riding their bicycles over to the Roxy to watch the latest
surf movie. Now the owner of a surfboard repair business, Roper said
he kept a chunk of concrete from the rubble when they knocked the
theater down. "It's now a post office," Roper said.</TE>
<TE>   As the surf movie business withered over the years, surf videos
took their place. But many of them are cranked out by surf apparel,
wetsuit and surfboard manufacturers such as Quiksilver, Rusty and
others, as marketing tools. Typically, a surfing team representing a
company is sent to some tropical surf paradise accompanied by a
cinematographer. They are then videotaped wearing the latest apparel
line, shoes, sunglasses and surfing on the newest line of boards, and
the film is later edited with a catchy soundtrack.</TE>
<TE>   Darin Bingham, 35, owner of Half Moon Bay Board shop on the
Northern California coast, said Carlos' effort could help revive the
infectious energy of watching feature-length surf movies in a
theater.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it can work here because a majority of the surfers
haven't ever seen a surf movie on a big screen.... Watching a movie
with hundreds of other surfers in the audience would be great,"
Bingham said. "I haven't done that since the time I saw 'Beyond
Blazing Boards' at Half Moon Bay High School."</TE>
<TE>   The man who revved up interest in the surf movie business in
Huntington Beach was Hugh Larry Thomas, the former owner of the Surf
Theatre. Now 61 and retired in Palm Springs, Thomas recalled the
1920-era building and opening it as a theater just before Christmas
in 1962. At the time, it was one of the few theaters in town.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Thomas showed first-run movies but later -- as the
multiplexes pulled away his clients -- turned to showing skiing and
surfing movies. He also produced and filmed his own surf flick,
"Standing Room Only."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas had a front row seat as the fledgling surf movie business
progressed from 8mm to 16mm shorts to full-length features such as
"Pacific Vibrations," "Endless Summer," and "Five Summer Stories."</TE>
<TE>   He recalls that some filmmakers, including Bud Browne, drove from
theater to theater, toting their films and their own sound equipment.
Sometimes surfing celebrities such as Barry Kanaiaupuni, Gerry Lopez,
Shaun Tomson, Owl Chapman and Wayne "Rabbit" Bartholomew would pop up
in the audience.</TE>
<TE>   The Surf Theatre was bulldozed in 1989, a victim of redevelopment.
The area is now a parking lot. While Carlos has no plans to open his
own theater, he and his wife, Leslie, are hoping that by finding and
renting venues for surf films, they will spark a revival.</TE>

<CX>   Surf Theater -- A caption in some editions of Sunday's California
section said that a photo of the Surf Theater in Huntington Beach was
taken in 1939. But some readers noticed that the film listed on the
marquee, "Diary of a Chambermaid," was not released until 1946.
According to the Huntington Beach city historian, the photograph was
taken in the 1950s.</CX>

1960s and '70s, when wave riders packed cinemas. His two showings

<LD>It's been years since the old Surf Theatre was torn down, but
Huntington Beach residents like Dave Carlos still recall the
emotional rush they felt sitting inside the downtown movie house as
their favorite surfers slashed across the big screen riding perfect
green waves.</LD>
<LD>   It was a visceral, shared experience for young surfers who packed
the theater in the 1960s and '70s to watch "surfumentaries" such as
"Pacific Vibrations" and "Five Summer Stories."</LD>
<LD>   "I was a little kid and any time some guy in the movie would carve
a wave, we would scream and yell and hoot, loving every minute of
it," Carlos said.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the old theaters that catered to the surf crowd have
closed or shifted to more mainstream fare, and present-day
surfumentaries are now released almost exclusively on video or DVD.</TE>
<TE>   But Carlos -- who at 38 still structures his life around riding
waves -- is hoping to reignite the excitement that having a local
cinema for surf films once meant to thousands of young wave riders
from San Diego to Santa Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Carlos, a telemarketer, put up $6,000 to rent the
Mann's Pierside Pavilion theater and promote a revival of the surf
movie experience. On the bill was "Burning the Map," a documentary
featuring 21-year-old Timmy Turner, a popular local surfer who
starred in and helped direct his own coming-of-age film with
Indonesia's incredible waves as a backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos was concerned that he might not recoup his investment, but,
it turned out, he needn't have worried. The 400-seat theater sold out
-- at $8.75 a seat -- and excited viewers, including Turner's
parents, relatives and friends, who gave Carlos a standing ovation. A
second show was also packed.</TE>
<TE>   "They're bringing back that spirit," said an excited Sean Thomas,
39, whose family owned the Surf Theatre when it was home base for the
beach crowd.</TE>
<TE>   With the night's success now past, Carlos said he has heard from
theater owners and filmmakers from Laguna Niguel to Ventura to
Hawaii, all wondering whether a new wave of interest in surf films is
building. The next show in Huntington Beach is Thursday, when "The
Kill 6," a local effort from Santa Barbara filmmaker Josh Pomer, will
be shown.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos said he is cautiously optimistic that he has tapped into a
sense of community that surfers seek.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most vivid memories for Southern California surfers
from the baby-boom generation was accompanying friends to see the
latest surf movie by Bruce Brown or Hal Jepsen at places such as the
Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, La Paloma Theater in Encinitas, and
the Magic Lantern Theater in Santa Barbara. Of all those, only the La
Paloma still specializes in surf films.</TE>
<TE>   "It was electric," said Drew Kampion, the former editor of Surfer
magazine who wrote the narration for "Five Summer Stories."</TE>
<TE>   The movie houses provided what was then the only venue for the
pioneer makers of surfing films. And, surfers, usually just by word
of mouth, always seemed to find out who was coming to town, and when.</TE>
<TE>   For Kampion, it was Brown's seminal surf film "Endless Summer"
that kick-started his love affair with the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   He remembers standing in line outside the Santa Monica Civic
Auditorium on what seemed a perfect afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "The place was just mobbed, and it was extreme and everyone was
there. It delivered on so many levels that my imagination ... it was
one of the clearest memories in my mind. I remember Robert August and
Mike Hynson riding those waves at Cape St. Francis."</TE>
<TE>   It was just as important to be there as it was to watch what was
on the screen, Carlos said.</TE>
<TE>   Being there gave young surfers -- many of whom were still learning
to ride waves -- a sense that they were part of the California surf
scene, said Chris Brewster, 47, who recently retired as lifeguard
chief for San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference between going to a surf movie at the La Paloma and
going to a cineplex is that you knew everyone else there shared your
passion," said Brewster, who used to hitchhike from San Diego to
Encinitas to catch the latest offering.</TE>
<TE>   For some, the movie house gathering left strong and lasting
memories.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Rambeau, a Santa Monica city employee, recalled the communal
feeling of watching "Endless Summer" at the civic auditorium in San
Gabriel.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Councilwoman Donna Frye, who is married to surfer and
surfboard shaper Skip Frye, recalled the fun evenings she spent as a
youth watching surf movies. "If they're trying to revive the old
spirit, it's a great idea," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "You followed the movies wherever they were going to play.
Sometimes it was at the Roxy in Pacific Beach. I remember when
"Endless Summer" came out and it didn't have any sound and Bruce
Brown toured with it," Frye said. "He would take a microphone and
narrate the film adding his own humor as he went along."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Roper, 44, has fond memories of grabbing his friends on a
Friday and riding their bicycles over to the Roxy to watch the latest
surf movie. Now the owner of a surfboard repair business, Roper said
he kept a chunk of concrete from the rubble when they knocked the
theater down.</TE>
<TE>   "It's now a post office," Roper said.</TE>
<TE>   As the surf movie business withered over the years, surf videos
took their place. But many of them are cranked out by surf apparel,
wetsuit and surfboard manufacturers such as Quiksilver, Rusty and
others, as marketing tools. Typically, a surfing team representing a
company is sent to some tropical surf paradise accompanied by a
cinematographer. They are then videotaped wearing the latest apparel
line, shoes, sunglasses and surfing on the newest line of boards.
Darin Bingham, 35, owner of Half Moon Bay Board shop on the Northern
California coast, said Carlos' effort could help revive the
infectious energy of watching feature-length surf movies in a
theater.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it can work here because a majority of the surfers
haven't ever seen a surf movie on a big screen.... Watching a movie
with hundreds of other surfers in the audience would be great,"
Bingham said. "I haven't done that since the time I saw 'Beyond
Blazing Boards' at Half Moon Bay High School."</TE>
<TE>   The man who revved up interest in the surf movie business in
Huntington Beach was Hugh Larry Thomas, the former owner of the Surf
Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Now 61 and retired in Palm Springs, Thomas recalled the 1920-era
building and opening it as a theater just before Christmas in 1962.
It was one of the few theaters in town.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Thomas showed first-run movies but later -- as the
multiplexes pulled away his clients -- turned to showing skiing and
surfing movies.</TE>
<TE>   He also produced and filmed his own surf flick, "Standing Room
Only."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas had a front row seat as the fledgling surf movie business
progressed from 8mm to 16mm shorts to full-length features such as
"Pacific Vibrations," "Endless Summer," and "Five Summer Stories."</TE>
<TE>   He recalls that some filmmakers, including Bud Browne, drove from
theater to theater, toting their films and their sound equipment.
Sometimes surfing celebrities such as Barry Kanaiaupuni, Gerry Lopez,
Owl Chapman and Wayne "Rabbit" Bartholomew would pop up in the
audience.</TE>
<TE>   The Surf Theatre was bulldozed in 1989 to make room for a parking
lot.While Carlos has no plans to open his own theater, he and his
wife, Leslie, are hoping that by finding and renting venues for surf
films, they will spark a revival.</TE>

<LD>Louis Silvie Zamperini, 85, took up running when he was about 5, the
same age he took up smoking. Sometimes his fleet feet came in handy
for escaping the police.</LD>
<LD>   But they also took him to the 1936 Berlin Olympics, to USC, into
NCAA and wartime record books, and into a museum that will highlight
the contributions of Italians in the history of the West. He even has
a new autobiography coming out, "Devil at My Heels," co-written by
David Rensin; it is a more detailed version of one he wrote in 1954.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing could deter Zamperini from running, which helped him
transcend the mean streets. When he was about 7, a boy who had
challenged him to a race took the lead, only to run in front of a car
and be crippled for life.</LD>
<TE>   "I was lucky he beat me," Zamperini said in a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   Zamperini was born in upstate New York in 1917 to an Italian
immigrant father and Italian American mother. Two years later, his
family left the East Coast because doctors warned that Louie and his
older brother, Pete, would die of pneumonia if they didn't escape the
harsh climate.</TE>
<TE>   They moved to a tough Torrance neighborhood where anti-Italian
sentiment ran high. Until first grade, he spoke only Italian and was
mercilessly teased by other kids. He quickly learned English, along
with how to fight to survive.</TE>
<TE>   His bravado made him tough but also made for close shaves, from
hopping and falling off freight trains to almost drowning at the
Redondo Beach saltwater plunge, when someone pushed him off a
20-foot-high platform. He was pulled from the water unconscious, but
earned the family nickname "Lucky Louie" by surviving.</TE>
<TE>   " 'We move to California for your health, and here you are almost
dying every day,' my mother always reminded me," Zamperini recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Like many Depression-era kids, he grew up tough and poor.
Neighborhood parents warned the violent and rebellious teenager to
stay on his own block and away from their children.</TE>
<TE>   "I cursed freely. I destroyed property. I ordered kids around. I
never used my head, never thought about consequences," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Undisciplined and constantly in trouble, he ditched school, rang
church bells in the middle of the night, let air out of teachers'
tires, stole beer from bootleggers, spread axle grease on railway
tracks so the train had a hard time braking, peppered neighbors' pets
with a BB gun, stole pies from a bakery and bullied kids into
fistfights.</TE>
<TE>   When a Catholic priest twisted his ear for being late to Mass, he
got even by attending the Baptist church with a buddy.</TE>
<TE>   His thirst for revenge against anyone who crossed him dominated
his life, until he discovered how to earn respect by running.</TE>
<TE>   At first, he ran to escape the police, who always seemed to be
after him for something. But in February 1933, he entered the mile
race at Torrance High as a favor to Pete, who was trying to keep his
sibling out of trouble. Zamperini won in 4 minutes 58 seconds,
breaking the school record, which Pete had held.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, with his brother's help, he cut back on smoking and
drinking, and won the interscholastic mile with a record of 4:21.2 at
the L.A. Memorial Coliseum. That high school record would stand for
20 years.</TE>
<TE>   The newspapers began calling him "Leather Lung," "Iron Man" and
"Zamp the Champ." Classmates cheered him on as the "Torrance
Tornado." No longer a loner, Zamperini made friends fast. Even the
principal learned his name. He relished every moment in the
limelight, knowing at last how he could make something of himself.</TE>
<TE>   In 1936, he won a scholarship to USC and, at 18, made the U.S.
Olympic track team. But he partied and danced his way across the
Atlantic by ship, gaining more than 14 pounds and losing any real
chance to be competitive. He finished eighth in his only event, the
5,000-meter race.</TE>
<TE>   But his final lap of 56 seconds set a record and caught the eye of
Adolf Hitler, who demanded to shake the hand of the spunky American.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Hitler grasped my hand and said, 'Ah! The boy with the fast
finish!' " Zamperini recalled.</TE>
<TE>   After a few celebratory beers, Zamperini wanted a souvenir. On a
whim, he scaled a 15-foot wall surrounding the Reich Chancellery, the
Nazi equivalent of the White House, and seized the Nazis' swastika
flag off the flagpole. But he'd been seen. As guards called for him
to stop, he leaped to the ground and ran -- which had worked before.
But no one had ever shot at him before. The Germans did; he stopped.</TE>
<TE>   He got the souvenir anyway. When Gen. Werner von Fritsch, Hitler's
commander-in-chief of the army, learned the thief's identity, he gave
Zamperini the flag, which he still has.</TE>
<TE>   Zamperini returned from Berlin to start his freshman year at USC,
where he shed the excess weight and set the best NCAA mile mark two
years running: in 1938, with 4:08.3; and in 1939, with 4:13.6. His
1938 time set a collegiate record that lasted 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   He graduated in 1940, traded in his running shoes for wings and
signed up as a bombardier. While he was on a rescue mission south of
Hawaii on May 27, 1943, two of the plane's four engines stopped. Then
the plane exploded.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like someone hit me in the head with a sledgehammer,"
Zamperini said. He blacked out, but his Trojan ring caught on the
window latch and saved his life. He came to as the plane was sinking.
He crawled aboard a life raft with the only other survivors of the
11-man crew, Francis McNamara and Russell Phillips.</TE>
<TE>   The trio exhausted their meager supplies in a few days -- eight
half-pints of water and six chocolate bars. They tried to fish, but
sharks bit off their catch.</TE>
<TE>   "We were in constant, horrible fear," Zamperini said. "Sometimes
one [shark] would put its head right up on the raft and look at us.
We'd whack them on the nose with the paddles."</TE>
<TE>   On the 27th day into their journey, a Japanese plane spotted them
and opened fire. Zamperini dived into the water as the others played
dead in the raft. All three survived, but their raft wound up with 48
holes.</TE>
<TE>   They worked to plug them, but six days later McNamara died of
starvation and dehydration. Then it rained, enabling Zamperini and
Phillips to survive.</TE>
<TE>   After 47 days adrift, they were each down to about 70 pounds. A
Japanese patrol boat found them at the southernmost part of the
Marshall Islands -- nearly 2,000 miles from where they had crashed.</TE>
<TE>   They weren't exactly rescued. The two, so weak they could barely
stand, were blindfolded and dragged from one POW camp to another.
After three months, they were sent to different camps. Both suffered,
but both survived.</TE>
<TE>   Zamperini was tortured, beaten, fed vermin-infested rice balls and
used as a guinea pig by a Japanese doctor, he said. "When the
Japanese found out I was a star runner, they broke my nose three
times," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it was a cosmic carry-over from his childhood nickname,
but he was luckier than those who had come before him. "I found a
crude engraving on the wall of my cell which read, '9 Marines
marooned on Makin Island -- August 12, 1942,' " he said. The Marines,
who had included their names, were later beheaded. Zamperini
memorized the names and reported their fate after the war.</TE>
<TE>   He'd been in captivity more than a year when, under duress, he
made a Japanese radio propaganda broadcast in November 1944. His
family was stunned to learn he was alive. "My parents had already
received my Purple Heart for 'wounds resulting in my death,' "
Zamperini said.</TE>
<TE>   When he refused to make another broadcast, he was sent to a
special camp where he endured even greater torture, he said. His
anger at his tormentors helped him survive, as did his dreams of
renewed glory in running.</TE>
<TE>   When the war ended in 1945, Zamperini returned home but was never
able to run the way he once had. The dreams that had sustained him
for 2 1/2 years in captivity collapsed in the face of harsh
realities.</TE>
<TE>   "I was drunk, angry and I didn't know what I was looking for," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   While on R &amp; R in Miami in 1946, he met a local debutante, Cynthia
Applewhite. They were married that year. But he had a hard time
finding a job and, because of a housing shortage, they lived with
friends.</TE>
<TE>   Nightmares plagued him and his drinking worsened. He swore to take
revenge on his Japanese tormentors. His worried wife urged him to go
listen to a young preacher named Billy Graham. That sermon changed
his life and saved his marriage.</TE>
<TE>   In 1950, Zamperini returned to Japan -- not for revenge, but to
forgive. "The warmth that the Japanese people showed me more than
compensated for the suffering I had in those camps," he said. Upbeat
and encouraging, he traveled the world for more than a decade to tell
his story and spread the Gospel. He made a living in commercial real
estate and as a youth counselor with a local Presbyterian church.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, he returned to Japan to appear in a CBS feature about his
POW experience, which aired during the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   He plans to be at the unveiling of the Italian American history
museum in Italian Hall when it opens sometime next year in the shadow
of City Hall at El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historic Monument.
Memorabilia from his life and sports career will be featured in the
sports history exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   Zamperini will be 86 next month, and he still walks two miles
every day in his Hollywood Hills neighborhood. He has carried the
Olympic torch four times. He still skis and flies planes, but gave up
skateboarding in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm having the time of my life," he said. "My new book is coming
out next month, and a studio has optioned my life story. Nicolas Cage
might play me."</TE>

<LD>Six-year-old Michael Wong-Sasso gives new meaning to the phrase
"talkin' trash."</LD>
<LD>   All he wanted to do Saturday while celebrating his upcoming
seventh birthday was talk about garbage trucks, rubbish bins and
recycling.</LD>
<LD>   And unlike most kids who clamor to go to Chuck E. Cheese's or
Magic Mountain, Michael wanted to have his birthday party at a real
dump. So parents Sophia Wong and Vito Sasso arranged for an afternoon
of cake and crafts at Sunshine Canyon Landfill near their Granada
Hills home.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to be a garbage collector when I grow up," Michael
cheerfully tells everyone he meets. "I like the big trucks. I like
putting trash where it belongs. I like making the world cleaner."</TE>
<TE>   Wong smiled indulgently Saturday as her son rolled toy dump trucks
through a big pile of "clean" dirt that landfill operator
Browning-Ferris Industries had set aside for the party-goers to romp
in. About 40 friends and their parents attended.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know where this interest in trash came from," said Wong,
who with her husband owns the Two Guys From Italy restaurants in the
San Fernando Valley. "He's been this way since he was 2."</TE>
<TE>   For safety and sanitary reasons, the party was held in a small
valley on the landfill's outskirts, away from bulldozers and out of
range of odors. The party-goers were surrounded by scores of potted
trees, which BFI uses to landscape Sunshine Canyon as portions become
filled in.</TE>
<TE>   The children had a session of fashioning flour-dough animals with
the help of recycled materials such as cardboard and colored paper,
and then scrambled about wildly on the dirt pile among toy backhoes
and earthmovers.</TE>
<TE>   Michael, whose birthday is Friday, described the different types
of trash trucks -- side-loaders and front-loaders -- and talked
enthusiastically on how recycling "is good for all the people in the
world."</TE>
<TE>   His favorite pastimes include trailing trucks on their collection
routes (in the company of his parents or sitter) and peering into
trash cans. He said he wants to go to college so he can learn to
drive a trash truck.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people have said, 'Why don't you steer him in a different
direction?' " his mother said. "My answer is this is his passion.
Whatever his interest is, I support it."</TE>
<TE>   Piedad Velasquez of Northridge, who brought her 6-year-old
daughter, Rebecca, agreed with that notion. "I think it's great that
they support Michael's desire to be a trash hauler. We really need
kids that think that way. Not everyone can grow up to be a nuclear
scientist."</TE>
<TE>   Having a party at a dump is "definitely different," said
Northridge resident Scott Krause as he watched his son Trevor, 6,
leaping off the dirt mound.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like you're saying, 'Oh no, not another birthday at the
landfill.' I mean, how many times can you go to Chuck E. Cheese's?"</TE>

<LD>Two men were injured early Saturday in a drive-by shooting in El Rio,
the Ventura County Sheriff's Department said.</LD>
<LD>   Salvador Martinez, 27, was in critical condition Saturday night at
St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard after undergoing surgery
for bullet wounds in his abdomen and thigh, sheriff's officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Fernando Candido, 26, was in fair condition at Ventura County
Medical Center in Ventura, with gunshot wounds in his thigh, shoulder
and neck.</LD>
<TE>   Martinez and Candido, who are neighbors, were in Martinez's garage
in the 300 block of Will Street about 4 a.m. when a car carrying up
to four men drove past. One of the occupants began firing through the
open garage door before the car sped away.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors reported hearing gunfire and called deputies.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities do not have a description of the car or a motive, but
detectives are investigating whether the incident was gang-related.</TE>

<HD>City's Future Is in Erasing the Past</HD>
<DH>New leaders in Mission Viejo plan to reverse many actions
taken by their predecessors. Facilities named after officials are a
concern.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dave McKibben</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fed up with what they perceived to be the indulgent ways of their
predecessors, the newly remade Mission Viejo City Council has hit the
rewind button and is undoing the most fundamental decisions of
previous city leaders --  even the names on parks and conference
centers could be erased.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps it was the William S. Craycraft Sports Park or, maybe, the
Sherri M. Butterfield Community Room that pushed things over the
edge.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever the case, the practice of naming rooms, conference
centers and even parks after council members -- some while the
part-time politicians were still in office -- has helped bring an
elevated sense of politics to Mission Viejo.</LD>
<TE>   In the weeks since the November city elections when two first-time
candidates, Trish Kelley and Lance MacLean, swept into office --
easily toppling longtime incumbents Susan Withrow and Butterfield --
the new council has quickly gotten down to business.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor John Paul Ledesma has scheduled a Jan. 6 closed-door session
to discuss the continued employment of City Manager Dan Joseph. "I'm
stunned," said Joseph, a 13-year city employee.</TE>
<TE>   A prior decision to close one of the city's original recreation
centers is under review, as is a proposal to save money by closing
the city library on Fridays. Instead, the council is considering
cutting expenses by imposing a City Hall hiring freeze. The council
took the first step in changing the council practice of naming city
facilities after local politicians, voting to create a committee that
will review the parks, community rooms and conference centers now
named after past or present city officials.</TE>
<TE>   Far from a home-grown takeover, the political shift in Mission
Viejo was a calculated move orchestrated in part by former
Assemblyman John R. Lewis, an Orange resident who used out-of-county
campaign money to help upend Butterfield and Withrow.</TE>
<TE>   "Every election cycle I like to get involved in a place where I
can make a difference," said Lewis, who helped form the Friends of
Mission Viejo group that raised nearly $45,000 to support Kelley,
MacLean and Ledesma. "I like to think I made a difference in Mission
Viejo."</TE>
<TE>   Even Lewis was surprised at the election results. Ledesma was the
top vote-getter, and Kelley and MacLean won nearly three times as
many votes as Butterfield and Withrow, both well-known city leaders
who served on prominent county committees and boards.</TE>
<TE>   "I was astonished at the margins," Lewis said. "I don't think I've
ever seen anything like that."</TE>
<TE>   Withrow and Butterfield said they too were surprised. "I sat
around scratching my head for two weeks after the election because it
was so lopsided," said Withrow, a three-term councilwoman who was the
chairwoman of the coalition of South County cities that fought the El
Toro airport.Mailers were sent out by Friends of Mission Viejo in the
final weeks of the campaign, focusing on the naming issue and a
California closed-meeting law violation by Withrow, Butterfield and
Craycraft in 1999. A judge ruled that the three council members
unlawfully criticized and intimidated Ledesma during a closed
session.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly half the money collected by Friends of Mission Viejo,
$19,000, came from Astrum Utility Services and For the Game, Solana
Beach companies owned by J. Jeffrey Kinsell. Astrum organizes
municipal utilities; For the Game develops and operates recreational
facilities. Lewis said out-of-county contributors are not unusual and
those individuals who gave to Friends of Mission Viejo were longtime
contacts.</TE>
<TE>   Friends of Mission Viejo wasn't the only group taking credit for
the political upset in Mission Viejo. If Lewis' group finished off
the incumbents, then the Mission Viejo-based Committee for Integrity
in Government might have softened them up by constantly questioning
the council's spending habits. The committee, a 5-year-old watchdog
group, strongly supported the three winning candidates this year and
backed Ledesma in 1998 and Councilwoman Gail Reavis in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Morton, a local attorney who is chairman of the committee,
said his people campaigned vigorously for MacLean, Kelley and Reavis
but did not lend financial support.</TE>
<TE>   Morton said there is no connection between his committee and
Lewis' group.</TE>
<TE>   Morton said his group does have strong ties to four of the five
council members: Reavis, Kelley, MacLean and Ledesma. That link was
highlighted when six of the first seven action items in the group's
November newsletter appeared on the new council's first agenda.</TE>
<TE>   The group's newsletter also has called for the ouster of Joseph;
Assistant City Manager Rich Howard; the city's de facto police chief,
Stan Jacquot, a lieutenant with the Orange County Sheriff's
Department; and librarian Valerie Maginnis, whose husband ran for
council in November.</TE>
<TE>   Morton said that newsletter's author, committee member Dale Tyler,
may have gotten a "little gung-ho" after the committee's election day
successes.</TE>
<TE>   MacLean, also a member of the committee, said he was uncomfortable
with the letter and the group's message. "Part of the problem now is
that they are metamorphosing into more of policy group than a
watchdog group," he said.MacLean said the naming issue, which seemed
to resonate with voters, is worth examining.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to look at the whole package, and that includes the
positive accomplishments of Craycraft and Butterfield," he said.
"Butterfield didn't participate in the vote for the room named in her
honor. I'd be more inclined to leave that one alone. I found it to be
more egregious with Craycraft because he voted for himself and broke
the tie."</TE>
<TE>   Butterfield said naming facilities after longtime city leaders,
even if still in office, seemed a fair way of "recording history."
Withrow agreed, though she conceded the council may have
underestimated how voters would react and the political price they
would pay.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it tweaked more people than I anticipated," she said.</TE>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three teenage boys, celebrating the 18th birthday of one, were killed
when their speeding car crashed into a power pole late Friday in
Lancaster, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The identity of only one was released: Jason Allison of Lancaster.
Friday was his birthday. The other two boys were 16 to 18 years old,
authorities said. All three were in a 1990 Mustang convertible, which
Allison was driving.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, his friends gave him a surprise birthday party, which
he had left to pick someone up when the accident happened at 95th
Street West and Avenue K, his father said.</LD>
<TE>   Family members described Allison as a teenager who took advantage
of Southern California's diverse topography -- fishing, dirt biking
and surfing in the summer; snowboarding in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   His father, Matthew Allison, recalled how he and his son would
often ride motorcycles together and surf each summer for a week at
Ventura County's beaches.</TE>
<TE>   "He had such a loving spirit," said his mother, Diane Collins. "He
was so respectful. He minded so well. He was my best friend."</TE>
<TE>   After graduating next year, he planned to study network
engineering, following the career path of his father and older
brother.</TE>
<TE>   She said her home was filled with her son's friends Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   She recalled her last conversation with Jason -- in a chance call
she made to give him her new cell phone number.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank God I did," she said. "I told him, 'Have a happy birthday.
Be safe. I love you.' "</TE>

<HD>Keep the Promise Made to State's Most Vulnerable</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Bowman</AU>
<BD>Bill Bowman is executive director of the Regional
Center of Orange County.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the latest state budget projections from the Legislative
Analyst's Office in Sacramento forecasting multibillion-dollar
deficits, California's leaders face the daunting task of resolving
funding priorities in the next year's budget at the same time they
work to keep the state solvent during the current fiscal year.</LD>
<LD>   This will require bold action, and we will gain insight on how our
freshly elected leaders will respond to these ongoing challenges when
the Legislature convenes tomorrow for a special session called by
Gov. Gray Davis, who will deliver proposals for $10 billion in
immediate budget reductions.</LD>
<LD>   The governor and the Legislature should take this opportunity to
match boldness with wisdom and principle. They should stand firm on
California's promise to its most vulnerable citizens -- those with
developmental disabilities -- by taking funding for their
life-critical services off the budget negotiation table.</LD>
<TE>   Why shield these programs from the budget pain? There are no
celebrities or wealthy patrons from either party championing these
citizens -- only people with mental retardation, cerebral palsy,
autism and other developmental disabilities who are trusting
Californians to honor the commitment that enables them to live safely
and with dignity in our communities.</TE>
<TE>   Inspiration can be found in the origins of that promise. Thirty
years ago, visionary Democrats and Republicans conducted a bipartisan
overhaul of what had been a shameful and costly system of warehousing
people with developmental disabilities in remote institutions. By
passing the landmark Lanterman Act, they created a state-funded,
privately operated system of community care that enabled children
with developmental disabilities to receive the critical services they
need, while living at home with the love and support of family.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to enabling parents of children with even the severest
disabilities to keep their families whole, the Lanterman Act's
community care system provided a similarly cost-effective means for
adults with developmental disabilities to receive essential services
and supports they need to thrive in mainstream society. Even in the
face of chronic underfunding, this system of 21 regional centers has
proved to be an excellent value for the state's taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   Together, the regional centers deliver effective, cost-efficient
services to the more than 170,000 Californians with developmental
disabilities who, in an earlier time, would largely have been
institutionalized. At the Regional Center of Orange County, we
accomplish this by operating under a set of guiding principles.</TE>
<TE>   These principles direct us to implement the Lanterman Act in ways
that are responsive to the needs of the people we serve through
careful stewardship, which we define as "thoughtful, responsible
action." This culture of stewardship, involving all sectors of the
community, has led to countless reforms of procedure, process and
method that ensure we squeeze maximum value out of each tax dollar
entrusted to us, while continually improving the quality of services
available to people with disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, when, earlier this fiscal year, the state mandated a
$52-million cut to the regional center system budget -- $3.2 million
of it to come from Orange County -- we knew there was precious little
"extra" to be found, especially in light of the autism epidemic
facing Orange County and the state as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   As our leaders review options for resolving our budget crisis, it
is important for them to recognize that it is only through the
combined efforts of thousands of caring individuals -- many of whom
work at minimum wage -- that the community care system has managed to
continue operating to this point.</TE>
<TE>   There is ample evidence that people with disabilities and those
who serve them in Orange County have an enduring commitment to wise
stewardship of tax dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Equally evident is that further cuts would seriously erode the
vital and fragile system that thousands of families depend on for the
necessities of life. The outcome of the December Special Session and
the coming fiscal year's budget actions could very well be turning
points in California's commitment to its most vulnerable citizens. We
look to these proceedings with hope that they will bring an
affirmation from our elected leaders that people with developmental
disabilities still have a place in California's communities.</TE>

<HD>Health Safety Net Is Fraying</HD>
<DH>Supervisors recently voted to spend an additional $2
million on indigent care. This is like throwing a glass of water on a
house fire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Marian Bergeson</AU>
<BD>Marian Bergeson of Newport Beach is a former Orange
County supervisor, state senator, state education secretary and
member of the California Board of Education.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Contrary to what many believe, UCI Medical Center -- Orange County's
only university medical center -- is not the county hospital. In
fact, Orange County does not have a county hospital. Yet the Board of
Supervisors is still legally responsible for providing emergency
health care to unfunded patients.</LD>
<LD>   County residents have depended on UCI Medical Center as a resource
for patients for more than 25 years, regardless of their ability to
pay. Nevertheless, UCI Medical Center alone cannot continue to bear
most of the cost of indigent health care.</LD>
<LD>   In many years of public service, from state senator to member of
the Board of Supervisors and secretary of Child Development and
Education, I have seen Orange County continue to make indigent health
care a very low priority.</LD>
<TE>   Funding for the Medical Services for Indigents (MSI) program has
been provided at appallingly low rates. UCI Medical Center and the
other 24 hospitals that contract with the county to provide MSI
cannot continue to subsidize the county's very clear legal and
ethical obligation. Orange County's excellent community clinics also
cannot, and should not have to, fulfill the county's mandate without
adequate compensation.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors recently voted to spend an additional $2
million on MSI, bringing its total commitment to $47 million for the
fiscal year. This is like throwing a glass of water on a house fire.
It is widely acknowledged in the health-care community that the
county must at least double its current spending to make MSI a
viable, comprehensive program. However, our supervisors choose to
ignore health issues in favor of long-term debt reduction.</TE>
<TE>   We are all aware of the lagging economy's effect on government at
the federal, state and local levels. As a former supervisor, I can
certainly appreciate the fact that Orange County will not be able to
spend as freely as it has in the past.</TE>
<TE>   However, the MSI program has never been adequately funded, and it
is time for supervisors to rectify the situation. I am embarrassed to
say that this county spends less per capita on health care than all
but one other county in California. In one of the wealthiest counties
of California, it is unfathomable that health care is not a higher
priority.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors must repair Orange County's already unstable
safety net of health care for the uninsured and underinsured by
allocating significantly more funding toward that end. With the
federal and state governments implementing or considering cuts in
funding for hospitals that provide a disproportionate share of care
to indigent patients, it is imperative to shore up the safety net.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County's health-care crisis has been termed "a
meltdown" by Jim Lott, executive director of the Healthcare Assn. of
Southern California. Because of this crisis, the county-run hospitals
and clinics faced severe cuts and possibly closure. But voters
overwhelmingly supported and passed Measure B, which will provide
much-needed funding to L.A. County's faltering emergency and trauma
network. They were inspired by the possibility that they or their
families might not get needed care because the system was inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   We cannot afford to be shortsighted with regard to public health.
As it is affecting our neighbor Los Angeles, this issue affects us
all and is not limited to the indigent people who depend upon the MSI
program. Without changes, Orange County will suffer the consequences
of the MSI system's inadequacies in the form of increased incidences
of communicable disease infection, business losses associated with
missed days of work because of illness, and increased waiting times
in emergency rooms because of patients using emergency rooms for
their primary care needs. Our supervisors must act now to prevent
irreparable damage to Orange County's health-care system.</TE>
<TE>   As a start, the county must put more money into the MSI program.
Supervisors must reorder priorities and find additional funds to meet
the county's legal obligation.</TE>
<TE>   That may mean reallocation of dollars. Funds follow commitment
even when things are tough.</TE>
<TE>   Improved reimbursement for services will ensure greater
participation from Orange County physicians, clinics and hospitals
and the creation of a better community-based system of care. If we do
not take preventive steps, we will be in a quagmire similar to that
of the county public health system in Los Angeles County, and that
will be a problem for all residents of Orange County.</TE>

<DH>A Lifeless Team Leaves Toledo's Pink Slip Showing</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was as ugly as a botched flea flicker. It was as rude as a
handicapped parking violator.</LD>
<LD>   If these were the final minutes in the UCLA coaching career of Bob
Toledo, they were darkly appropriate.</LD>
<LD>   In one corner of the half-empty Rose Bowl Saturday night, fans in
Bruin sweatshirts chanted, "Bob must go! Bob must go!"</LD>
<TE>   In another corner, fans wearing Bruin jerseys hung over a tunnel
railing and, as Toledo ran inside, chanted, "Goodbye Bob! Goodbye
Bob!"</TE>
<TE>   In between the two groups sat USC boosters, moved to silence by
either apathy or pity.</TE>
<TE>   It was so nasty during UCLA's regular season-ending 48-27 loss to
Washington State on Saturday, Toledo felt closest to those Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been involved in a game where so many people wanted
you to lose," Toledo said. "I think the Trojan fans were the only
ones who wanted us to win."</TE>
<TE>   An amazing quote, from an abandoned coach.</TE>
<TE>   Shunned by everyone but the family members and close friends who
applauded what could be the final postgame news conference of his
seven seasons here, Bob Toledo made one last pitch for his job.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a team picked for sixth in the conference, then when our
quarterback Cory Paus went down everyone counted us out," he said,
staring blankly into the cameras and notebooks. "But we finished tied
for fourth and we're going to a bowl game and we have a lot of
returning players."</TE>
<TE>   By the time he had finished, much of the passion had drained from
his voice.</TE>
<TE>   Standing several feet away, much of the color had left Athletic
Director Dan Guerrero's face.</TE>
<TE>   What happens now?</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero said Saturday that he is "still evaluating" the coaching
position and that he would meet with Toledo early this week.</TE>
<TE>   But if Guerrero is basing his decision on Saturday's game, as many
believed he was, then it is no decision at all.</TE>
<TE>   For a second consecutive game, the Bruins faced an opponent they
couldn't stop, surrounded by fans who couldn't watch.</TE>
<TE>   The 100 points allowed to USC and Washington State combined is the
most given up in consecutive games by a Bruin team in 82 years.</TE>
<TE>   It hasn't been this bad since their first two years of existence,
when they lost to such teams as Hollywood High, the USS Idaho and
Whittier.</TE>
<TE>   The number of fans leaving the Rose Bowl by the start of the
fourth quarter is also surely a two-game record, the Bruins turning a
vibrant football treasure into a pale red graveyard.</TE>
<TE>   With a home schedule next season that does not include a
high-profile nonconference opponent, or USC or Washington State, it
could get emptier before it gets better.</TE>
<TE>   One of the jobs of any high-profile coach in this entertainment
town is to build a team that creates a buzz.</TE>
<TE>   Even though this game had an impact on 13 bowls, not to mention
the future of a coach who once came within two wins of a national
title, there was no buzz.</TE>
<TE>   The tailgaters were quiet, as if they had parked there by
accident.</TE>
<TE>   The fans were so subdued that it took cheerleaders pleading into
full-volume microphones to rouse them.</TE>
<TE>   "Eight-clap! C'mon now! EIGHT-CLAP!"</TE>
<TE>   Then there were the Bruin football players. They were the quietest
of all.</TE>
<TE>   Again.</TE>
<TE>   "I think all this [firing] talk has had a big effect on the psyche
of my team," Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   One of his few veterans agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "It was there, it was on our minds, I won't lie," said tight end
Mike Seidman.</TE>
<TE>   Then it was all over the field, for more than three hours, and it
was awful.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Gesser, the Washington State quarterback, was suffering from
a sprained ankle so serious, his lower right leg was bundled up like
a Sunday newspaper. His limp was so pronounced, it appeared he needed
crutches.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Bruins rarely hit him, barely pressured him, allowed him
to throw for two touchdowns and 247 yards while standing in the
pocket like a pelican.</TE>
<TE>   "The harder it is for him, the better he seems to do," said his
coach, Mike Price.</TE>
<TE>   For these Bruins, the opposite always seems true.</TE>
<TE>   Since Toledo's emotional Cotton Bowl win over Texas A&amp;M in his
second season here in 1997, they have consistently crumpled on the
final lap.</TE>
<TE>   This is the fourth time in five years that his team has lost its
final regular-season game.</TE>
<TE>   During those five years, the team is 8-11 in November and December
games.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the Bruins were outgained, 541-307, while allowing
the Cougars to score on nearly every conceivable lapse, short and
long, quick and endless.</TE>
<TE>   A flanker threw a touchdown pass. A 94-yard drive ended in a
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   A long punt return led to a touchdown. An 80-yard run scored a
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   A fumble led to a field goal. A blocked punt led to a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   A scrambling throw by the limping quarterback led to a field goal.
And the Cougars returned an interception for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   That about cover it?</TE>
<TE>   Toledo could be asked to change the defensive coordinator, but
he's already gone through four in seven years.</TE>
<TE>   He could be asked to change the offensive coordinator, but, um,
that's him.</TE>
<TE>   There is a phrase Dan Guerrero has used to describe what he likes
to see in his teams.</TE>
<TE>   "Fire out," he says. "I like to see them fire out."</TE>
<TE>   On a day the Bruins rushed for only 79 yards and committed four
turnovers, about the only time anybody really fired out was when
senior tackle Mike Saffer blatantly hammered a Cougar defender about
five seconds after the whistle, leading to a personal foul and brief
benching.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a bad play, it was my fault, but I don't regret it," he
said. "It's football."</TE>
<TE>   That may be Guerrero's dilemma this week when deciding the future
of a coach who once won 20 consecutive games, but has since gone
24-24.</TE>
<TE>   It might seem silly to fire an engaging coach and smooth recruiter
whose team is young and whose only crime may be that he is too nice.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, it's football.</TE>

<HD>Navy Shows Army How to Run a Tight Ship</HD>
<DH>Quarterback Candeto scores six rushing touchdowns to tie
Division I-A record in Midshipmen's 58-12 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>While close games have been a tradition in the annual Army-Navy game,
Midshipmen quarterback Craig Candeto made sure there was nothing
traditional about Saturday's game.</LD>
<LD>   Candeto set a school record and tied an NCAA mark with six rushing
touchdowns, and he passed for another to lead Navy past Army, 58-12,
at Giants Stadium in one of the most lopsided outcomes in the 103
meetings between the service academies.</LD>
<LD>   Candeto tied the Division I-A record for most rushing touchdowns
by a quarterback, set by Air Force's Dee Dowis against San Diego
State to open the 1989 season. Candeto scored on three one-yard runs
and from 42, seven and three yards.</LD>
<TE>   "It's pretty special," Candeto said. "It humbles me to know there
are so many great players that have played throughout this tradition.
For me to have this record, I'm really at a loss for words."</TE>
<TE>   His performance gave the Midshipmen (2-10) a triumphant end to an
otherwise forgettable season, in which they'd lost 10 straight before
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Navy's point total was the most in the game's history, and the
46-point margin was the second-largest in the series, behind a 51-0
Navy win in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   The 508 yards of total offense and 421 rushing yards set game
records, and Candeto's touchdowns and point total were the most by a
player in the series.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, a videotaped message from President Bush was
shown, in which he thanked the Army and Navy players for their
service.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud of every Cadet and Midshipman," Bush said. "You are
devoted to serving your country and your fellow citizens. You will
join the finest military in the world, and throughout your careers,
you will keep the peace and defend freedom."</TE>
<TE>   Although Army leads the series 49-47-7, the Black Knights (1-11)
had trouble dealing with an embarrassing loss.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hurt -- embarrassed as a matter of fact," said Army
quarterback Reggie Nevels. "Losing a game like that has great impact
on my pride."</TE>

<HD>Oklahoma Leaves Impression</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>With no national championship berth on the line, Oklahoma and
Colorado didn't pack the house for Saturday night's Big 12 Conference
title game.</LD>
<LD>   At least the Sooners are headed for one of college football's
coveted bowl championship series spots, a nice consolation prize for
missing out on the Fiesta Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Nate Hybl threw two touchdowns passes and Quentin Griffin rushed
for a championship game-record 188 yards and two touchdowns as the
eighth-ranked Sooners beat the No. 12 Buffaloes, 29-7, to win the Big
12 for the second time in three years.</LD>
<TE>   The victory probably will send Oklahoma (11-2) to the Rose Bowl
against Washington State (10-2).</TE>
<TE>   "Being the Big 12 champs, we'll go wherever they want to take us,"
Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops said. "All the bowls are excellent, and it
will be a great environment."</TE>
<TE>   A disappointing announced crowd of 63,332 attended the game,
although Reliant Stadium appeared far less full than its 69,500
capacity.</TE>
<TE>   The Sooners beat Kansas State for the Big 12 title in 2000 and
went on to beat Florida State in the Orange Bowl for the national
championship.</TE>
<TE>   Griffin eclipsed 100 yards for the ninth consecutive game. Griffin
finished the regular season No. 2 on Oklahoma's single-season rushing
list with 1,740 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been executing a lot in the running game and pass
protection," said Griffin, the game's most valuable player, adding
praise for his offensive line. "I can't say enough about those guys.
They played really well the whole year."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Calhoun, starting for injured running back Chris Brown,
rushed for 122 yards for the Buffaloes, who were trying to become
repeat champions in the Big 12 after last year's 39-37 victory over
Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Hybl threw touchdown passes of three yards to Trent Smith in the
first quarter and 21 yards to Mark Clayton in the second quarter as
the Sooners took a 13-0 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado kicker Pat Brougham missed field goals of 41, 32 in the
first half and 33 yards in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "The team was actually supportive," Brougham said. "They have
faith in me, as I have in myself. I take full blame for this loss.
Those misses put us in too tough positions. After two of those
misses, they drove right down on our defense. I feel real bad about
this game."</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Bloom gave Colorado brief momentum in the third quarter
with an 80-yard punt return early in the quarter, cutting Oklahoma's
lead to 13-7.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming into the game, their punter [Blake Ferguson] was ranked
11th in the league so I thought I'd get a chance," Bloom said. "He
kicked it far, the other 10 guys did their job blocking downfield."</TE>
<TE>   The Sooners then scored 16 consecutive points to ice the game.
First, Griffin broke 36 yards late in the third quarter. The Sooners
started the fourth quarter with a drive that took up 5:14, setting up
a 28-yard field goal by Trey DiCarlo with 7:53 left. Griffin then
broke free again with 3:49 left.</TE>
<TE>   "To shut them out defensively -- and I guess we held them under
200 yards (193) -- it was another incredible performance," Stoops
said.</TE>
<TE>   Griffin laid the groundwork for the Sooners in the first half. He
had 41 yards in six carries leading up to Hybl's three-yard touchdown
pass to Smith late in the first quarter. Smith caught a perfectly
lofted pass in the back of the end zone on third down.</TE>
<TE>   A 15-yard screen pass from Hybl to Griffin and a 15-yard facemask
penalty helped the Sooners take a 13-0 lead with 9:38 left in the
second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Hybl completed a 21-yard touchdown pass to Clayton,
running ahead of cornerback Donald Strickland in the end zone. Phil
Jackson blocked the extra-point attempt by Trey DiCarlo.</TE>
<TE>   "It hasn't sunk in yet," Hybl said. "It's been a long five years
here, and it means everything to go out as a champion."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado reached Oklahoma's 23-yard line with its first drive
before Brougham's 41-yarder was wide right. His 32-yarder also was
wide right in the closing minutes of the second quarter.</TE>

<LD>This afternoon, when the door slams one final time in the three-story
Georgian Colonial clubhouse and the last courtesy car takes a left
down the red brick driveway at Sherwood Country Club, we will say
goodbye to the golf pros until January.</LD>
<LD>   By about 3 o'clock, they're on vacation from all events, official
and otherwise, at least as they relate to golf. The holidays are here
and the players can devote their time to even more important issues,
such as buying presents. That should keep all of them busy, no one
more so than Bernhard Langer, who is shopping for his wife and four
children, ages 2 to 16. Maybe he can get a group discount.</LD>
<LD>   At this time of the year, it's important that the players don't
get left out, because after 11 1/2 months of whacking golf balls at
swank country clubs and posh golf resorts over the world after
arriving in their private jets, they deserve some Christmas gifts
just as much as anyone.</LD>
<TE>   And they might even find something under the tree that would come
in handy closing the gap on Tiger Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Someone may already have started making a list, such as Woods, who
is in hot pursuit of a yacht he's looking to purchase, obviously to
expand the gap everyone else is trying to close. Ahoy, Capt. Tiger.</TE>
<TE>   Here are a few suggestions for the lucky 16 players who are
dividing $3.8 million at the Target World Challenge.</TE>
<TE>   For Phil Mickelson -- Winning a major, which is the only thing
that's going to bring him closer to Woods, not that hug we saw at the
Skins Game. Also, a new putter, one that doesn't look as if it
belongs on the roof and can bring in 155 channels.</TE>
<TE>   For Woods -- Not a single thing, except for someone to drive his
boat so he can squeeze in some more practice by knocking golf balls
off the bow.</TE>
<TE>   For Davis Love III -- A healthy back and neck for an entire season
... but not one more shirt with stripes, please.</TE>
<TE>   For Jim Furyk -- Driving it farther (he ranked 173rd this year),
putting it better (ranked 114th), and a whole year without a question
about why his swing looks like something he got out of a box.</TE>
<TE>   For Retief Goosen -- Winning a bookend major to go along with the
2001 U.S. Open to prove he remains a threat each time out, and also a
whole year without a question about being struck by lightning or how
to spell his golf shrink's name. (It's Jos Vanstiphout).</TE>
<TE>   For Padraig Harrington -- A map of the United States, so he'll
play over here more often and prove once again that he's one of the
rare players who don't fall victim to the Tiger Fear Factor.</TE>
<TE>   For Colin Montgomerie -- A healthy back, a jolly attitude and a
pair of earmuffs to put over his rabbit ears.</TE>
<TE>   For Nick Price -- A house without a calendar so he won't be
reminded he turns 47 next month, plus a videotape of highlights that
showed how he won $2.17 million this year at 46.</TE>
<TE>   For David Toms -- Driving it farther (114th this year), and
continued mastery on the greens, where he was second only to Bob
Heintz. Also, a national championship for his beloved alma mater,
LSU.</TE>
<TE>   For Langer -- A Ryder Cup captain's job in 2004, plus somebody to
take that cap off his head and round out the brim that's so flat it
looks as if you could serve salad on it.</TE>
<TE>   For Vijay Singh -- A vacation from the range. Nobody should work
that hard except the guy running the ball machine.</TE>
<TE>   Rich Beem -- No wake-up call. It was magic when he won the PGA
Championship, holding off that Woods guy, which put him at the top
for a moment ... and leaving him only one way to go after that.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Campbell -- A charge in the majors, which he didn't do
this year: 46th at the Masters, 119th at the U.S. Open, 84th at the
British Open, 23rd at the PGA.</TE>
<TE>   Chris DiMarco -- A fourth consecutive year with a victory. Also,
getting a patent for the "claw" putting grip.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Estes -- Another year when he seems to just show up and finish
in the top 10. He did it eight times. Also, a consistent hairstyle.
It's either long, shaggy, short or something in between and his
barber is getting a complex.</TE>
<TE>   Mark O'Meara -- A Skins Game next Thanksgiving weekend when he
socks away close to $500,000 again, not to mention a PGA Tour
victory, which would be his first in five years. Also, the house next
door to Woods to keep the influence pipeline flowing: You never know
when that's going to come in handy.</TE>

<LD>Let's get ready to ... sue!</LD>
<LD>   Dapper ring announcer Michael Buffer, known for growling, "Let's
get ready to rumble!" doesn't take kindly to those who violate his
copyright on that phrase.</LD>
<LD>   He and his brother, Bruce, got the U.S. Patent and Trademark
office to copyright the phrase and his image, and they are vigilant
about taking legal action against anyone who appropriates it.</LD>
<TE>   "It's no different from someone using Pepsi's name to sell another
cola," Buffer told Associated Press. "It's my business, it's what I
do for a living."</TE>
<TE>   Buffer makes a comfortable living uttering those words before
professional boxing matches as well as at bar mitzvahs, bass fishing
tournaments, birthday parties, building implosions and corporate
meetings. He also has appeared on TV and in movies such as "Rocky V"
and "Ocean's Eleven."</TE>
<TE>   But his pet phrase almost didn't come to be.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried, 'Man your battle stations,' 'Fasten your seat belts,'
that kind of thing," he said. "I wanted a hook that would get a
little energy back into the fight. [Muhammad] Ali used to say he was
'Ready to rumble,' and 'Rumble, young man, rumble.' I took that and
fine-tuned it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the first Los Angeles Laker to wear No. 33,
now retired in honor of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The not-so-frozen north: Global warming apparently is causing the
demise of hockey in the far northern reaches of Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Villages where people once skated on outdoor rinks from September
through April have had their seasons cut because the ice doesn't
freeze until mid-December and melts in March.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd think we'd be skating all year round," amateur hockey coach
David Kilabuk, who lives in the remote Canadian village of
Pangnirtung, told Bloomberg News. "That's not the case."</TE>
<TE>   Said Canadian hockey official Tom Thompson, "Who would have
thought that in the winter we wouldn't be able to freeze ice?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He knows a real jam: Cuban-born Euclides Rojas, hired last week as
bullpen coach of the Boston Red Sox, came to the United States on a
15-foot rowboat that had lost its motor and was adrift in the Gulf
Stream until it was spotted by a Coast Guard cutter.</TE>
<TE>   He and his family were taken to a refugee center in Guantanamo and
remained there until former teammate Rene Arocha sponsored their
immigration bid.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not easy," Rojas told the Boston Globe, "but it was easier
than what the Cuban people are passing through now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Hot Rod Hundley, longtime voice of the Utah Jazz,
the Lakers' opponent tonight.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Tennis great Rod Laver, inducted into the Sport
Australia Hall of Fame last week, said big prize money had influenced
many prominent players to abbreviate their careers.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at Ken Rosewall and Lew Hoad, my hero, we just
couldn't bail out at an early age," Laver told the Sydney Morning
Herald. "We put a lot of credit in those years, whereas Boris Becker
and whereas Stefan Edberg, well, when the player pockets are full,
they are out of there.</TE>
<TE>   "But Lleyton Hewitt, I don't feel that way about. I think he is a
great competitor and a great Australian."</TE>

<LD>Juggling minutes for players has always been a difficult task for
basketball coaches, especially those with standout reserves aching
for a chance to show off their skills.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes it's a blessing to have such a deep rotation. At other
times, it's a headache.</LD>
<LD>   Just ask Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry, who on Saturday called on
Tremaine Fowlkes to play against Kevin Garnett of the Minnesota
Timberwolves. It meant someone would be forced to sit while Fowlkes
went after Garnett.</LD>
<TE>   That someone turned out to be Quentin Richardson, who had to be
content with playing only six minutes against the Timberwolves.
Matchups dictated his decision, Gentry would say after the Clippers'
104-88 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to play him at [small forward]," Gentry said of
Richardson, a shooting guard who has had a sore right knee since
suffering a sprain that sidelined him for most of training camp in
October.</TE>
<TE>   "Tremaine played well. Marko [Jaric] was doing a good job. Pike
[Eric Piatkowski] shot the ball well. It's all part of being a team.
Guys have to accept the fact that sometimes they're not going to
play."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Elton Brand on Fowlkes, who scored a career-best 15 points:
"Awesome. I told him to make sure he got some shots. Those were good
shots. I'm out there yelling at him, 'Shoot.' He knocked them down.
He played great. I was excited for him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers left for New Orleans, the first stop on a four-game
trip, immediately after Saturday's game. On Monday they face the
Hornets, who relocated during the off-season from Charlotte, N.C.
They also play the Dallas Mavericks, San Antonio Spurs and Houston
Rockets.</TE>

<HD>This Clipper Victory Is a Fowlkes Tale</HD>
<DH>Seldom-used forward, in a rare start, neutralizes Garnett
and scores 15 points in 104-88 win over Minnesota. Brand has 26
points, 17 rebounds.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twenty games into the season, the Clippers are still a chore to
figure out. What comes next is anyone's guess, but it probably won't
be dull. After all, who could have predicted what happened Saturday
afternoon at Staples Center?</LD>
<LD>   Power forward Elton Brand went for a season-best 26 points and had
17 rebounds, five assists and three blocks in 46 minutes against the
Minnesota Timberwolves. That part was fairly predictable.</LD>
<LD>   At the end, all anyone in Clipperdom could talk about was the job
seldom-used forward Tremaine Fowlkes did against Kevin Garnett, who
took only 13 shots while scoring 19 points. Without Fowlkes, the
Clippers would have been lost. With him, they seized a 104-88 victory
from Garnett and the Timberwolves before a crowd of 16,666.</LD>
<TE>   The Clippers made it look easy. There were no signs of the fumbles
and stumbles of recent weeks. They took a double-digit lead late and
held it.</TE>
<TE>   In winning their second in a row before starting a trip to New
Orleans, Dallas, San Antonio and Houston, the Clippers actually
resembled the polished and poised team so many expected them to be by
now.</TE>
<TE>   "Good win," Coach Alvin Gentry said before reconsidering his
opinion of the Clippers' eighth victory in 20 games. "Great win....
Elton had great numbers today, but Tremaine, with the defense he
played, I thought he played about as well as you can possibly play
Kevin Garnett."</TE>
<TE>   Even with Fowlkes hounding him, Garnett scored 14 points and took
11 rebounds for the Timberwolves in the first half. The Clippers held
a 52-51 lead, but it looked as if they were in for a long afternoon
against one of the game's most efficient players.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-8 Fowlkes had been buried on Gentry's bench for the
better part of the season, and seemed an odd choice to play against
Garnett.</TE>
<TE>   Until Saturday, Fowlkes had played in five games, averaged 1.6
points and 1.6 rebounds in 7.8 minutes. He sat out Wednesday's
victory over the Miami Heat after coming off the injured list to take
the roster spot of Michael Olowokandi, who has tendinitis in his left
knee.</TE>
<TE>   Then Fowlkes dropped a career-best 15 points on six-for-11
shooting in 28 minutes on the Timberwolves.</TE>
<TE>   Best of all, according to Gentry, was the defensive job Fowlkes
did on Garnett in the second half. After halftime, Fowlkes limited
Garnett to five points on two-for-five shooting and three rebounds.
The Clippers certainly could live with Garnett's scoring 19 points
and taking 14 rebounds in 38 minutes by game's end.</TE>
<TE>   "My assignment was to put pressure on Kevin Garnett, who's a
proven All-Star," Fowlkes said. "I just want to fill in because we
still have a lot of guys injured, and I wanted to take advantage of
that opportunity until those guys get healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry would have played Lamar Odom against Garnett, but Odom
remains sidelined by a sprained right ankle that could keep him out
until Christmas. Gentry thought about playing rookie guard Marko
Jaric against Garnett but saved Jaric for those moments when the
Clippers went to a zone defense.</TE>
<TE>   Jaric scored 14 points in 25 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Andre Miller, playing on a sprained left ankle, had 10 points and
nine assists, including a 60-foot lob pass to a streaking Fowlkes for
a dunk and a 78-67 lead with 3:20 left in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Piatkowski scored 19 points, giving the Clippers five players
with 10 points or more and enabling them to overcome what little else
the Timberwolves might have mustered beyond Garnett's rim-level play.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're turning a corner," Brand said. "We're learning how
to win these games. We're playing together, passing well and
scoring."</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Based on his steady play over the first two months of the season,
first-year player Kurt Sauer is proving that he has the ability to be
a top-notch NHL defenseman. Anaheim Coach Mike Babcock considers
Sauer the best rookie in the league.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone's always talking about [Mighty Duck forward Stanislav]
Chistov and all these guys, but the rookie of the year in the
National Hockey League from what I've seen so far is Kurt Sauer,"
Babcock said.</LD>
<LD>   Sauer, who played for Babcock with Spokane of the Western Hockey
League in 1999-2000, is a stay-at-home defenseman with only one
assist in 28 games.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm learning everything that I can every day," Sauer said. "The
guys on the team have been great helping me out. Hopefully, I'm
getting better."</TE>
<TE>   In order to make up for a lack of size, the line combination of
Matt Cullen, Jason Krog and Andy McDonald gets the job done with
speed.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't overpower people, so we have to use our quickness by
getting the puck up along the wall and skate into it," said McDonald,
who had a goal and assist in the Ducks' 4-3 victory at Chicago on
Friday.</TE>

<LD>There have been more electric days on the field in college football
than Saturday, but never one with more backroom buzz, money on the
line or participants conflicted:</LD>
<LD>   Pacific 10 against the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Orange Bowl vs. the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   The bowl championship series vs. Western civilization.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State Coach Mike Price against UCLA Coach Bob Toledo,
two friends who joked that when they get fired, they're going to open
a bait shop in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Well, with Saturday's victory over UCLA, Price may have sent
Toledo on his first step to Cancun.</TE>
<TE>   What a bizarre, complicated day it was, what with USC fans rooting
for UCLA while many UCLA fans were rooting against the Bruins in the
hope defeat would facilitate change.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of saying, "This is wonderful," Pac-10 Commissioner Tom
Hansen stood in the Rose Bowl press box before Saturday's UCLA game
and said, "Isn't this awful?"</TE>
<TE>   He could have added, "Isn't this confusing?"</TE>
<TE>   When the dust settled on Washington State's 48-27 win, unlocking
the mysteries of 13 bowl matchups, Washington State quarterback Jason
Gesser hobbled off the field and said, "I think we are playing Iowa,
but I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, after weeks of speculation and BCS bewilderment, we can
finally project an end to this madness.</TE>
<TE>   With Miami, Georgia, Washington State and Oklahoma all winning,
the bowl picture finally takes a form that doesn't resemble
room-temperature Jell-O.</TE>
<TE>   Here is what we think we know, in this office, at this hour, not
accounting for last-second knee-jerking, gerrymandering or
politicking.</TE>
<TE>   Miami and Ohio State, the nation's only two unbeaten teams, will
play for the national title in the Jan. 3 Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   That's a fact.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State, which clinched the Pac-10 bid, is going to play
Big 12 champion Oklahoma in the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa, co-champion of the Big Ten, is going to the Orange Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   USC will go to either the Sugar or Orange Bowl, and Notre Dame, at
10-2, will fall to the Gator Bowl. Then again, the Big Ten sort of
announced that in a news release Tuesday, didn't it?</TE>
<TE>   USC probably is headed to the Sugar Bowl to play Georgia, with the
Orange Bowl matching Iowa against Florida State.</TE>
<TE>   How did the Rose Bowl, which was supposed to keep its Pac-10-Big
Ten arrangement in years it wasn't hosting the national title, lose
Iowa to the Orange Bowl?</TE>
<TE>   Because Miami will end up No. 1 in today's final BCS standings,
the Orange Bowl gets the first selection of at-large schools. The
Rose Bowl, because it lost No. 2 Ohio State, gets the second pick.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange Bowl, needing an anchor school that will guarantee a
huge turnout, will take the third-ranked Hawkeyes.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl, although not a happy camper, is resigned to this
outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand they need to do what they have to do," Rose Bowl
chief executive Mitch Dorger said of the Orange Bowl. "We'd prefer a
Pac-10-Big Ten matchup, but we understand everything they're talking
about is perfectly within their right. They need to first and
foremost take care of their bowl, their committee and their
community."</TE>
<TE>   There is another scenario in which the Orange Bowl could, legally,
crown its bowl the "Rose Bowl of the South."</TE>
<TE>   Iowa vs. USC in Miami? It's probably a longshot, but under BCS
guidelines, it would work like this: Because the Orange Bowl has a
slightly higher payout than the Sugar -- specific figures won't be
known until gate receipts are counted -- the Orange Bowl could jump
order and take USC from the Sugar.</TE>
<TE>   BCS sources say this option is on the table, although BCS
spokesman John Paquette said Saturday night he could only "confirm
the procedure."</TE>
<TE>   If the Orange Bowl took USC to match with Iowa, it would obviously
displease both the Rose and Sugar bowls and you would think this
displeasure would be a factor in the Orange Bowl's ultimate decision.</TE>
<TE>   This unfolding day of strangeness had Hansen, the Pac-10
commissioner, privately rooting for a Washington State win, against
the best interests of the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen works on behalf of all 10 member schools and knew a
Washington State win would put a second Pac-10 school into the BCS,
and that would mean an extra $4.5 million for the conference.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always uncomfortable at conference games because I know one
of my friends is going to lose," Hansen said. "I like nonconference
games where we win by a huge margin. Last Saturday [USC over Notre
Dame] was the kind of day I like."</TE>
<TE>   Hansen is also eager to send a conference team to the Sugar or
Orange bowls to prove the Pac-10 can fill major bowl seats in
stadiums east of Tempe.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday was a day when the winners and losers got lost in the
nuances of the complicated BCS system, ostensibly created in 1998 to
help simplify a college game that has been unwilling to trade the
venerated bowl system for a playoff.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, college football has tried to marry the concepts, with
dubious results.</TE>
<TE>   For the third consecutive year, the BCS is shadowed by
controversy. In 2000 and 2001, the top two ranked schools in both
polls could not meet for the title because the No. 2 team each year
was not No. 2 in the BCS standings.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the system will have matched the undisputed top teams,
Miami and Ohio State, which is what the BCS is designed to do.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the fallout this year with the non-championship bowls could
have lasting repercussions. By midweek, the Rose Bowl became resigned
to the fact that it was going to lose Iowa to the Orange Bowl in a
certain scenario.</TE>
<TE>   That scenario came true.</TE>
<TE>   There had been rumbling of behind-the-scenes bickering between the
Orange and Rose bowls, but the Rose Bowl is doing its best to take
the high road.</TE>
<TE>   "We have absolutely no animosity toward the Rose Bowl," Dorger
said.</TE>
<TE>   So today, at 11 a.m., the Rose Bowl's six-member panel of the Game
Policy Subcommittee will convene in Pasadena and likely conclude, all
things considered, that Oklahoma is OK.</TE>
<TE>   It could have been worse. Had Colorado defeated Oklahoma in
Saturday's Big 12 title game, the Rose Bowl would have been left with
an undesirable choice among Colorado, USC and Florida State.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even want to go there," Rose Bowl President Gary Thomas
said of that possibility.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to Oklahoma, he doesn't have to.</TE>

<HD>It's Going to Be Tough to Pass This Harrington</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Bonk</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His second cousin is Detroit Lion quarterback Joey Harrington, a fact
that Padraig Harrington of Dublin, Ireland, is quick to point out.</LD>
<LD>   "Back in Ireland, the Irish say everybody is related to everybody
anyway," Harrington said.</LD>
<LD>   "Terrible. I'm not even the top sportsman in the family."</LD>
<TE>   Maybe, but Harrington was clearly the top golfer on the course
Saturday at Sherwood Country Club, where he had three eagles, fired a
course-record, nine-under-par 63 and took a six-shot lead over Tiger
Woods after three rounds of the $3.8-million Target World Challenge
in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington's total of rounds of 65-69-63 is 19 under and he played
the five par-fives in eight under -- three eagles and two birdies.
Harrington has five eagles in three rounds and he is a total of 19
under on the par-fives.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, this is a great golf course to shoot low scores,
with all the par fives out there," he said. "You can play
aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   At the fifth, he holed out from 70 yards with a lob wedge for his
second eagle of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington said he had a difficult time believing his good
fortune.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the guy who believes everybody else chips in and makes
eagles, not me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Woods shot a two-under 70 and said he was feeling under the
weather. His 203 total is one shot better than Bernhard Langer, who
had a 65.</TE>
<TE>   Langer said that despite Harrington's lead, it's not safe.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of us have the length to reach these par-fives," he said.
"If Padraig is off his game a little, he can easily go in the water.
There is a lot of trouble if you don't hit it straight or precise.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been low rounds here, and if someone gets it going and
his lead goes down, it is going to be harder."</TE>
<TE>   Woods said a good night's sleep will make him feel better, but so
will playing better today.</TE>
<TE>   "I just need to play a good, solid front nine and hopefully narrow
the gap so I have a realistic chance on the back nine," Woods said.
"If I can realistically narrow that gap with the three par-fives on
the back, anything can happen."</TE>

<HD>Solid Start Changes Murray's Playoff Mind-Set</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the week before Thanksgiving last year, King Coach Andy Murray set
the table: To make the playoffs, he told a floundering group about to
fall six games below .500, the Kings would need 93 points, 80 in
their last 64 games.</LD>
<LD>   They qualified with 95, but 93 would have been sufficient.</LD>
<LD>   This season, the Kings having maintained a record above .500
through the season's first two months despite a rash of injuries to
key players and a demanding road schedule, Murray has made no such
pronouncements.</LD>
<TE>   If he has a point goal in mind, he's not ready to share it.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year," he said, "we felt we had to spell it out exactly and
say, 'This is how many wins we have to get, this is how many points
we have to get,' because we were at the bottom. We were in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "Our winning percentage the rest of the year had to be so high,
but we might as well face that and say, 'We can't waste another
game.' I don't think we're in that situation where we have to say,
'This is how many points you have to have.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Brad Chartrand, with one point in his last 23 games, was
scratched Saturday. for the first time in 62 games since he was
recalled from the minors in January.</TE>

<HD>Kings' Loss Is Hard to Stomach</HD>
<DH>Nearly at full strength for the first time this season,
they still fall to the floundering Blue Jackets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings are nearly whole again.</LD>
<LD>   Which is not to say they are without holes.</LD>
<LD>   With the return to the lineup Saturday night of Adam Deadmarsh and
Ian Laperriere, following the Thursday night return of Jason Allison,
only the absence of injured defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky kept the
Kings from playing at full strength for the first time this season.</LD>
<TE>   But that didn't stop them from absorbing a 4-2 loss to the
Columbus Blue Jackets, who not only had been reeling -- three
consecutive losses, six in seven games -- but had played Friday
night, losing to the Sharks, 3-2, at San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Derrick Walser's power-play goal with 17 minutes to play was the
winner in front of a capacity crowd of 18,118 at Staples Center, the
Blue Jackets taking advantage of a hooking penalty against Steve
Heinze.</TE>
<TE>   And it didn't sit well.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disgusted with this effort tonight," King captain Mattias
Norstrom said. "As a group, we've got to realize that playing hockey
the way we did tonight, the way we did against Nashville [in a 3-2
loss to the Predators on Thursday night], is not acceptable for us as
players if we have any kind of pride.</TE>
<TE>   "This has got to stop. This is the way a losing team plays, and we
know that we're a way better team than this."</TE>
<TE>   Through a rash of injuries to key players and a demanding road
schedule, the Kings have mostly run in place through the season's
first two months.</TE>
<TE>   Since a 3-0 start, they're 7-9-4-3 and have been outscored, 66-59.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't play .500 hockey the rest of the way and expect to be in
the playoffs," Coach Andy Murray said last week. "It won't happen."</TE>
<TE>   That was before they lost to the Predators, an especially galling
defeat in that it came at home against the worst team in the Western
Conference in Allison's unexpectedly early return from a knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   But as bad as that was, this one might have been worse.</TE>
<TE>   "At some points, it was embarrassing the way we played,"
Laperriere said. "We've got to realize we're not going to make the
playoffs playing like that."</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jackets had won only two of their last 19 road games.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, 5-1 losers to the Blue Jackets on Oct. 27 at Columbus,
Ohio, matched their goal total from that game only 2 minutes 51
seconds into this one. In the Blue Jacket zone, Allison won a faceoff
in the left circle, chased down the puck and slid a pass to Ziggy
Palffy charging down the middle.</TE>
<TE>   From the slot, Palffy scored his seventh goal of the season.</TE>
<TE>   At 17:15, the Blue Jackets tied the score on a power-play goal by
18-year-old rookie Rick Nash, the No. 1 pick in June's entry draft.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings squandered a great chance to reclaim the lead early in
the second period, failing to score during a two-man advantage after
Luke Richardson (cross-checking) and Matt Davidson (holding) were
penalized on the same play.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Jacket Coach Dave King, whose team scored two power-play
goals while killing all six of its penalties, called it the turning
point of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Because we survived it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Whitney, on a shot from the right faceoff circle, gave the
Blue Jackets a 2-1 lead at 19:17, but Deadmarsh scored only 22
seconds later. His 10th goal, off a pass from Allison, pulled the
Kings even going into the third period.</TE>
<TE>   Three minutes into it, Walser scored from the top of the slot.</TE>

<HD>Quarter Master Kobe Hurting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry Stewart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after having one of his best quarters as a Laker, Kobe Bryant
sat out practice Saturday to have treatment on an injured groin.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant's condition was listed as day-to-day, but Coach Phil
Jackson said after practice that he thought Bryant would be able to
play against the Utah Jazz tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant put on an amazing show Friday night in the fourth quarter
of the Lakers' incredible 105-103 victory over the Dallas Mavericks.
It was doubly amazing when you consider he injured his groin in the
third quarter and might not have played the fourth had he not
convinced trainer Gary Vitti to keep his injury a secret from the
coaches.</LD>
<TE>   All Bryant did in the fourth quarter was score 21 points on
eight-for-eight shooting and make the winning basket with 8.4 seconds
left as the Lakers handed the Mavericks only their second loss of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers, who trailed by 30 points early in the third quarter,
outscored the Mavericks, 44-15, in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the weirdest game I've ever seen, and I've been watching
basketball for a long time," said assistant coach Tex Winter, who is
in his 56th season as a coach.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, who hasn't been around quite as long, said, "I've never
seen a game quite like that one."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if it was emotionally draining, Jackson said, "I think it
was emotionally draining on the players."</TE>
<TE>   In the first half, the Lakers could do nothing right, and the
Mavericks could do nothing wrong. The Mavericks finished the half
with a flurry to take a 64-36 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers missed all eight of their three-point shots in the
first half, while the Mavericks made 10 of 14. Derek Fisher was one
for nine from the field; Dallas' Dirk Nowitzki was five for five, and
three for three from long range. The Mavericks' Nick Van Exel made
three of his four three-point shots.</TE>
<TE>   The only Lakers to make more than one basket were Shaquille O'Neal
and Robert Horry, who each made three.</TE>
<TE>   And Bryant had perhaps his worst half as a Laker. He scored two
points, making one of four shots.</TE>
<TE>   About six minutes into the game, Bryant picked up his second foul
and Jackson took him out of the game.</TE>
<TE>   When he returned at the start of the second quarter, Bryant
appeared to be in a funk, refusing to shoot.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson was asked Saturday if Bryant was upset he had been
benched.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't say anything to me or give any signs that he was,"
Jackson said. "I think he was unhappy he got that second foul."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said the reason Bryant didn't shoot more in the first half
was because of the Mavericks' defense.</TE>
<TE>   "The spacing wasn't there for him to drive to the basket," he
said, "but the passing lanes were open."</TE>
<TE>   Winter said that when the Lakers finally began making their shots,
and Dallas began missing, the Mavericks "had to change their defense,
and that opened things up."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said assistant coach Frank Hamblen, who is in charge of
advance scouting, had pointed out in his report that the Mavericks
had been winning by large margins.</TE>
<TE>   "They hadn't had to play many games under duress," Jackson said.
"When we got close, they found themselves in a unique situation."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he hopes the momentum from the fourth quarter will
carry over into tonight's game.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know about momentum," he said. "She is a fickle girl."</TE>

<HD>McGahee, Hurricanes Rock the Vote</HD>
<DH>His six touchdowns help put No. 1 Miami in Fiesta Bowl with
56-45 win over Virginia Tech, and could put Heisman electors in a
quandary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Hacksaw the Heisman.</LD>
<LD>   Split that baby down the middle and hand the halves to Miami
teammates Ken Dorsey and Willis McGahee. That was the judicious
opinion of more than one Hurricane player Saturday in the breathless
aftermath of a 56-45 victory over Virginia Tech that leaves Miami
four quarters away from a second consecutive national championship.</LD>
<LD>   The undefeated Hurricanes are headed for the Fiesta Bowl, where on
Jan. 3 they will play undefeated Ohio State for the title. That
dominated the chatter in the Miami locker room after Saturday's game,
but there was also a lot of talk about the Heisman Trophy, which will
be awarded Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Who could stiff-arm Dorsey? He's 37-1 as the starting quarterback
and the caretaker of a 34-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Who could stiff-arm McGahee? He's only a sophomore, but he came
into the weekend with a 134.6-yard rushing average, then hammered the
Hokies for 205 yards and a school-record six touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, who could stiff-arm USC's quarterback? He's the
all-time leading passer in a conference that produced John Elway,
Troy Aikman and Dan Fouts.</TE>
<TE>   "Carson who?" Miami linebacker Jerome McDougle said, dead serious.
"Who's Carson Palmer?"</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, when McDougle thinks West Coast, he thinks Tampa.</TE>
<TE>   There is no denying the Hurricanes are worthy of their No. 1
ranking. They scored eight touchdowns against a good defense, often
needing only a few plays to reach the end zone. They had scoring
drives lasting 40 seconds, 47 seconds, 1:30 and 1:59. Others were
more protracted, requiring 2:02 and 2:10. And some felt like
marathons -- 4:23 and 5:44 -- even though they would be standard
issue for any other team.</TE>
<TE>   After trailing by three touchdowns in the first half and 49-21
early in the third quarter, Virginia Tech answered with a rally that
kept the 76,108 spectators in their seats despite a steady drizzle.
The scoring spree -- a 16-0 flurry by the Hokies -- happened just as
the Hurricanes were about to widen their lead to 35 points.</TE>
<TE>   With nine minutes left in the third quarter, Miami moved to within
a yard of the end zone and might have sent McGahee barreling in for
his seventh score of the day. Instead, the Hurricanes tried some
trickery. They sent their star running back to the sideline, and had
Jarrett Payton throw a halfback option pass for Dorsey. The wobbling
throw was intercepted by free safety Willie Pile and run back 96
yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "It was Dorsey's last game and I really wanted to give him
something to go out with," said Payton, son of late NFL great Walter
Payton. "I didn't put enough on it, though. He looked at me when we
got to the sideline and said, 'Come on, man, overthrow me.' ... I
didn't see the safety just sitting there. I thought he was wide open.
That's why I threw it to him kind of short."</TE>
<TE>   After Pile's touchdown, the Hokies scored 10 more unanswered
points to narrow the margin to 49-37. It got the attention of Miami's
players, but not so much that they stopped mingling with friends and
well-wishers on the sidelines. Jimmy Johnson was there, wearing a
Hawaiian shirt with a towel slung over his shoulder. So was former
Hurricane quarterback Bernie Kosar, who sat on the bench and gabbed
with Dorsey.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the same Miami juggernaut of last season. These
Hurricanes have had some close games, beating Florida State on a
missed field goal, trailing Rutgers in the fourth quarter, getting a
scare from Pitt. That the Hokies had cut the lead to 12 seemed more
an annoyance to the Miami players than a reason to panic.</TE>
<TE>   Said Dorsey: "We let them stay in the game too long."</TE>
<TE>   The Hokies were outgained, 556 yards to 364, and quarterback Bryan
Randall was sacked five times. He also was knocked out of the game
briefly at the end of the first half when he was flattened by
linebacker Jonathon Vilma and took a teeth-rearranging shot to the
mouth. Backup Grant Noel stepped in and threw a beautiful seven-yard
touchdown pass to Ernest Wilford.</TE>
<TE>   Randall, who gives defenses a steady diet of options and draws,
led Virginia Tech with 163 yards rushing in 25 carries. But it was
Lee Suggs who scored the Hokies' three rushing touchdowns, extending
his streak to 26 games with a rushing touchdown, an NCAA Division I-A
record.</TE>
<TE>   But the story of the day was the frightening explosiveness of
Miami's offense, both on the ground and in the air.</TE>
<TE>   Payton's errant pass was one of the few lowlights for Miami's
passing game, which otherwise gave the Hokies fits. Although he
completed only 12 of 20 passes, Dorsey threw for 300 yards and two
touchdowns. Andre Johnson caught six of those passes, scoring a
42-yard touchdown early in the first quarter -- even though a TV
replay showed he stepped out of bounds -- and reeling in a 68-yard
reception on the opening play of the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey also threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Kellen Winslow Jr.,
and the sophomore tight end later reciprocated by touting him for the
Heisman.</TE>
<TE>   "Palmer's a good quarterback, but Dorsey deserves it, plain and
simple," Winslow said.</TE>
<TE>   That's just one man's opinion, of course. Similar pitches are
being made all over the country by people promoting Palmer, McGahee,
Penn State running back Larry Johnson, Iowa quarterback Brad Banks
and others. Voters have until midday Wednesday to make their
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Tech Coach Frank Beamer, for one, wouldn't mind McGahee
getting it. But not for reasons you might think.</TE>
<TE>   "My vote is for McGahee," he said. Then, he added a hint of Big
East wishful thinking: "And he shouldn't bother to hang around here
anymore."</TE>

<LD>Talk about karma: One day you're blowing cigar smoke in the world's
face and 40 years later, you're still inhaling it.</LD>
<LD>   These are weird days for the Boston Celtics, who have what is
supposed to be a promising young team, with new ownership --
thankfully -- on its way in.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, it's taking a while for the new owners, venture
capitalists Wycliffe Grousbeck and Steve Pagliuca, to round up the
$360 million, so for another month or two, it's still Paul Gaston's
team, and he's running it on a shoestring budget.</LD>
<TE>   The scouting staff has been pared down. NBA teams customarily
stash extra players on the injured list -- even the Clippers have
three spares for a total of 15 -- but the Celtics alone have 12. When
Kedrick Brown was out the first five weeks, they had 11.</TE>
<TE>   In an irony anyone outside Boston would enjoy, the Celtics, who
were once a model of organization, not to mention braggadocio, are a
muddle. The operation Red Auerbach once ran with an iron hand, that
took such pride in its purity of purpose and "mystique," now steams
aimlessly in circles.</TE>
<TE>   Gaston's one real initiative in 10 years of uninterested, absentee
tenure after his father, Don, handed him the team, was to hire Rick
Pitino, which seemed like a good idea at the time but turned into a
disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Pitino made his many, frantic moves according to the dictates of
his pressing-style Ricky Ball, which meant he didn't need a big
center, only a mobile one like ... Travis Knight ... he thought.</TE>
<TE>   On the bright side, after 3 1/2 seasons of looking more and more
like the crew in "The Caine Mutiny," with everyone knowing the
captain was unbalanced but unsure what to do about it, they were
finally rid of Pitino.</TE>
<TE>   His successor was his assistant Jim O'Brien, who was personable,
low-key and didn't flaunt his ego, which was a welcome change.
Unfortunately for them, he was a Pitino disciple and, having gone so
far down that road, saw no choice but to keep going.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, the Celtics had an amorphous, committee-style setup in
which O'Brien seemed to have as much say in trades and drafting as
the people in the front office, who were supposed to be in charge of
the big picture.</TE>
<TE>   Still needing size, with three No. 1 picks in their first
post-Pitino draft of 2001, they used No. 10 for Joe Johnson, a wing
player, which was Paul Pierce's position ... No. 11 for another wing
player, Brown ... and No. 21 for a third, Joe Forte.</TE>
<TE>   Then, during last season's swoop back to the top of the (lame)
East, they traded Johnson to Phoenix for Rodney Rogers, an impending
free agent, reportedly without a commitment from Gaston that he'd
re-sign him.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, around that time, Gaston began talking to people who
wanted to buy the team.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, come summer, the Celtics offered only $1 million a
year and Rogers went to archrival New Jersey for a modest three-year,
$8-million deal.</TE>
<TE>   Then came their coup, sending Kenny Anderson, who had one year
left on his oversized contract, to Seattle for Vin Baker, who had
four at an average of $14 million.</TE>
<TE>   An official on another team says that was a Gaston move, which he
sold to his basketball people, to trim $1 million from his payroll
immediately and increase the sale price, which would be set by a
formula, which multiplied projected revenues.</TE>
<TE>   To the surprise of no one who'd seen Baker mope for the last three
seasons, Vin soon found a new home on the Celtic bench, which he now
leaves for 18 minutes a game, in which time he averages 5.4 points
and 4.4 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard all the spin when the Celtics made the trade," the
Boston Herald's Gerry Callahan wrote, "and some of us, regrettably,
swallowed it whole: THIS, the Celts assured us, was not going to be
the same slacker who wore out of his welcome in Seattle. This Vinny
was going to be different from that Vinny, they said, and on that
count, they were right: This Vinny is worse....</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you, Paul Gaston, you greedy, gutless, money-grubbing slug.
Have a nice life. Hope your new yacht sinks.</TE>
<TE>   "Give Vinny this: At least he has to show his face to get his
millions. Gaston just sends his lawyers to collect his ill-gotten
gains. If you're a loyal Celtic fan and you would like to hear an
explanation of the Baker trade from His Highness, you're going to
have to travel to Aspen and try to find him in a lift line."</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics remain contenders, but even if the new owners actually
care, they will have no cap room for years, low draft picks, no
players anyone wants, unless they break up their big two of Pierce
and Antoine Walker.</TE>
<TE>   On the bright side for Celtic fans, just as soon as Gaston
finishes selling off the parquet floor, the leprechaun, the retired
jerseys and the championship banners, they can have their franchise
back.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   The mess in Washington: The Wizards, rebuilding, developing young
players and trying to win while Michael Jordan is there, benched
20-year-old Kwame Brown, who started well but faded. "I don't know
how to take it," Brown said. "Like it's my fault we were losing.
[Coach Doug Collins] said he's trying to get my confidence back, but
putting me from first to third string isn't what I would call a
confidence helper."</TE>
<TE>   Said Collins, "What we're trying to do is win games. At the same
time we've got to get our younger players better. Throughout the
league, teams playing a lot of young players struggle. We can't do
that. It's a balancing act and right now we're playing some of the
older players."</TE>
<TE>   Another guy who'd like to get his hands on Gaston's neck: Dallas
owner Mark Cuban, who'll pay $20 million in luxury tax, is incensed
that it will be divided among teams that don't trigger the tax -- or
the way he sees it, don't spend money because they don't compete.
Said Cuban on a recent visit to Boston: "Nothing [ticks] me off more
than having some of that money go here. I've got to pay the luxury
tax and it goes to someone that's not even investing in their
organization."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, bad news: The Boston Globe's Peter May reports that with bonus
clauses, the Celtics will wind up triggering the tax, after all. Of
course, by then, the sale will be final and Gaston will be long gone.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio's Steve Smith, after Houston's Yao Ming hit the Spurs
for 27 points and 18 rebounds: "He's for real. He did that against
three 7-footers -- three 7-footers who can play. David Robinson.
Kevin Willis. Tim Duncan. Those aren't three stiffs."</TE>
<TE>   What a guy: Ricky Davis signed a Minnesota offer sheet, was
incensed when Cleveland matched and now, apparently, aims to make the
Cavaliers pay. To date, he has been suspended by Coach John Lucas and
had screaming arguments with teammates Tyrone Hill, Bimbo Coles,
Jumaine Jones and Zydrunas Ilgauskas. Said Hill, "I've tried to call
him, but he's not talking to anyone right now. I don't know what
sparked him but he's still our teammate."</TE>
<TE>   Gary Payton, on speculation he'll be replaced in Seattle by New
Jersey's Jason Kidd, a close friend: "It's his choice and he's going
to make up his own mind, but I don't think he'll do that.... Things
are going good for him right now and he'd be crazy to leave that.
They are one of the better teams in their conference and that's all
that you can ask for. That's all anybody wants, to win games and
compete for a championship."</TE>
<TE>   Indiana Coach Isiah Thomas, on the return of Reggie Miller: "He's
Shaq [O'Neal] of the little guys. Shaq comes back and all of a sudden
everybody gets open shots. Reggie comes back and it creates spacing
and opportunities for everyone else. I'm surprised we've been able to
get by as well as we've gotten by, pounding the ball inside and being
a power team. But you've got to have an inside-outside game. It's
like in football, you have to have a running game and a passing game;
you can't just have one."</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota's Kevin Garnett, on Utah's Karl Malone and John
Stockton: "They ain't lost nothin'. If anything, man, you can't get
rid of your mind. They play the game mentally. As much as it is
physical, it's all mental when it comes to those two. And I don't see
either one of them catching Alzheimer's any time soon. They're great
and that's why they are who they are."</TE>

<TE>   Friday's comeback is up there in Laker annals with last spring's
rally in Game 4 of the West finals against Sacramento, and Game 7 of
the 2000 West finals, when they came from behind in the fourth
quarter against Portland. Whether they've turned themselves around
remains to be seen, starting tonight against the venerable Jazz,
which outrebounded them by seven and outhustled them noticeably in
the bad old days last week.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Whitney and Juwan Howard have talked to their young teammates
all season about withstanding opponents' scoring runs.</LD>
<LD>   It paid off against the best team in the Eastern Conference.</LD>
<LD>   Whitney scored 23 points, and Howard had 17 points and 10
rebounds, and the Denver Nuggets held off the Indiana Pacers, 92-81,
Saturday night at Denver.</LD>
<TE>   The Nuggets played strong early, fought off a third-quarter run by
the Pacers, then pulled away late to end a five-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   "We tell them, even during games, that teams are going to make
runs," Whitney said. "They made their run, but we stayed strong. It
shows that we're growing up."</TE>
<TE>   The Pacers trailed, 49-37, at halftime, but went through Jermaine
O'Neal to get back in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana opened the third quarter by getting the ball to O'Neal in
the post nearly every time. He responded with eight points during a
15-4 run, capping it with a powerful two-handed dunk that cut
Denver's lead to 53-52 with seven minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal scored 23 of his 26 points in the second half, but it still
wasn't enough to keep the Pacers from losing for the third time in
four games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 121, Golden State 116 -- Dirk Nowitzki scored 35 points at
Oakland and the Mavericks barely shook off their big collapse from
the night before, rallying from an 11-point fourth-quarter deficit.</TE>
<TE>   After blowing a 30-point lead against the Lakers on Friday night,
the Mavericks needed a 10-2 run in the final minutes to win. Coach
Don Nelson was ejected early in the third quarter for protesting a
non-call.</TE>
<TE>   Earl Boykins scored 23 points for the Warriors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston 97, Philadelphia 72 -- Steve Francis scored eight of his
20 points in a decisive fourth-quarter for the Rockets, who won their
sixth in a row at home.</TE>
<TE>   Yao Ming had 18 points and 12 rebounds for Houston. Keith Van Horn
scored 15 points for Philadelphia, which lost for the second
consecutive time after winning eight in a row.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 121, Orlando 88 -- Kenyon Martin shut down Tracy
McGrady while New Jersey built a big early lead, and Jason Kidd
finished two rebounds short of a triple-double at East Rutherford,
N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Martin held McGrady to two-for-13 shooting in the first half.
McGrady finished with 16 points and four-for-20 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd had 15 points, 13 assists and eight rebounds before sitting
out the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans 94, Milwaukee 88 -- Jamal Mashburn scored 23 points,
and P.J. Brown and Baron Davis each scored 20 to lead the Hornets at
Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Mashburn, Brown and Davis combined for 15 free throws in the
fourth quarter. Ray Allen had 29 points for the Bucks, who have lost
three in a row for the first time this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington 100, New York 97 -- Larry Hughes matched a season high
with 22 points, including four free throws in the final minute, and
the Wizards overcame a second-half rally by the Knicks at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes had 10 rebounds for his third consecutive double-double.
Michael Jordan had 20 points and matched his season high with nine
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 94, Detroit 92 -- Glenn Robinson and Shareef Abdur-Rahim
scored 23 points apiece to lead the Hawks to their third consecutive
home victory.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Hamilton had 25 points for the Pistons, who have lost four
of five.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 100, Miami 71 -- Gary Payton had 18 points and 11 assists
to lead the SuperSonics at Seattle in a game in which eight technical
fouls were called.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 112, Cleveland 104 -- Jalen Rose scored 27 points at
Chicago, where the Bulls held on after blowing a 23-point lead.</TE>

<TE>   * Cincinnati (1-11) at Carolina (4-8), 10 a.m.: Panther tight end
Wesley Walls thinks he has the outcome figured out: "It will ... come
down to who makes one or two plays in the game." That might be asking
one or two plays too many. LINE: Carolina by 3.</TE>

<TE>   *** Buffalo (6-6) at New England (7-5), 10 a.m., Channel 2: Drew
Bledsoe returns to New England, but in a new stadium, and he still
won't know the answer to that burning question: Are the fans yelling
"Drew" or "boo"? LINE: New England by 4  1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Houston (3-9) at Pittsburgh (7-4-1), 10 a.m.: The last two
seasons with expansion teams (Cleveland in 1999, Jacksonville in
'95), Steelers managed only to split the season series with each.
This is their only game against Houston. LINE: Pittsburgh by 13  1/2.</TE>

<TE>   ** Philadelphia (9-3) at Seattle (4-8), 1 p.m.: With their success
using backup quarterbacks, Eagles aren't worried about something

<TE>   *** Denver (7-5) at New York Jets (6-6), 1:15 p.m., KLSX-FM

<HD>Hecht Loses Part of Ear in Sabres' 4-3 Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Buffalo Sabre forward Jochen Hecht lost part of his right ear after
being struck in the side of the head with a puck Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not a pretty sight," Sabre Coach Lindy Ruff said. "Once we
get him off the [trainer's] table, and I don't think he's off yet,
we'll see how he feels."</LD>
<LD>   The Sabres rallied to beat the Washington Capitals, 4-3, at home
when Adam Mair and Dmitri Kalinin scored 68 seconds apart late in the
third period.</LD>
<TE>   Hecht was hurt seven minutes into the third period after the
Sabres won a faceoff deep in the Capital zone. Hecht, who wears a
protective visor, was tumbling to the ice after appearing to lose his
balance, and was hit by teammate Brian Campbell's point shot.</TE>
<TE>   Hecht, bleeding from his right ear, remained face down for a
number of minutes before he was helped off the ice with the
assistance of teammates and trainer Jim Pizzutelli.</TE>
<TE>   Ruff didn't know the extent of Hecht's injury or whether he
sustained a concussion.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 1, New Jersey 0 -- Ed Belfour made a season-high 38 saves
for his league-leading fifth shutout, and Travis Green scored at
Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Belfour, 37, earned his fourth shutout in nine games and the 63rd
of his career, the most among active goalies. New Jersey outshot the
Maple Leafs, 38-14.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston 3, Tampa Bay 2 -- Bryan Berard tied the score when his shot
deflected off Andre Roy's skate in the third period, and Nick Boynton
scored the winner 3:11 into overtime at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 3, Philadelphia 1 -- Martin Rucinsky and Al MacInnis
scored first-period goals, and Fred Brathwaite made 24 saves for the
Blues at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia has gone a franchise-record 16 consecutive games
without scoring more than three goals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 5, Carolina 2 -- Martin Havlat scored his second goal of
the game midway through the third period, and Brad Smyth and Petr
Schastlivy had power-play goals late in the third period at Ottawa.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Islanders 6, Pittsburgh 3 -- Michael Peca scored his
first two goals this season and linemate Brad Isbister had a goal and
three assists at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Mario Lemieux scored his 13th goal for the Penguins.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton 4, Florida 0 -- Jussi Markkanen stopped 22 shots at
Sunrise, Fla., for his first shutout this season.</TE>

<HD>Curses ... No Soup for You!</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Judging from what we've been seeing and hearing during this football
season, the five worst things that can happen to an NFL player are:</LD>
<LD>   5. Playing for the Oakland Raiders and losing the overtime coin
toss.</LD>
<LD>   4. Playing for the Detroit Lions and winning the overtime coin
toss.</LD>
<TE>   3. Playing quarterback for Steve Spurrier.</TE>
<TE>   2. Getting traded to the Cincinnati Bengals.</TE>
<TE>   1. Getting your own Chunky Soup commercial.</TE>
<TE>   This has been quite a year for product placement in the NFL.
Terrell Owens' Sharpie. Randy Moss' Lexus. Michael Vick's invisible
Firebolt 2002 jet pack. And, of course, Campbell's Chunky Soup, which
is ruining more good careers than ephedrine yet is nowhere to be
found on the league's list of banned substances.</TE>
<TE>   Already, the Chunky Soup curse is part of NFL folklore. The word
has been out for weeks: Make a Chunky Soup commercial, brace yourself
for the unseen evil that already has claimed the following:</TE>
<TE>   Terrell Davis: Forced into premature retirement by mysterious
recurring knee injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Warner: Lost his first four starts, broke a finger, lost his
next two starts, broke his hand.</TE>
<TE>   Jerome Bettis: First he got chunky, then he got hurt. Now, most
weeks, he's chunky and hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan McNabb: Broke his ankle in November and is done for the
rest of the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Urlacher: His Chicago Bears went 13-3 last season before he
made the commercial. Since then, the Bears are 3-9.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Strahan: He broke the league's single-season record with
22.5 sacks in 2001, then made the commercial. Has only 11 sacks this
season ... and, curiously, no games on the schedule against Brett
Favre.</TE>
<TE>   Eerie, isn't it?</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the Chunky Soup curse has garnered the most publicity,
but when it comes to supernatural hexes and jinxes floating around
the NFL like Warner wobblers, it is not nearly alone. Believe it or
not, there might be worse curses out there.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Brown Curse</TE>
<TE>   The Bengals and the Bears are a combined 4-20 this season. The
reason? Two men named Mike Brown.</TE>
<TE>   One Mike Brown owns the Bengals -- has done so since 1990, the
last year the Bengals had a winning record (9-7) and made the
playoffs. After Brown took over, in 1991, the Bengals fell from first
to worst, finishing 3-13 -- the team's first of 12 consecutive
non-winning seasons. Twice AFC champions in the 1980s, the Bengals
are 54-134 since Brown became owner.</TE>
<TE>   The other Mike Brown plays safety for the Bears and was considered
something of a talisman during Chicago's otherwise inexplicable 13-3
finish in 2001. Brown returned two interceptions for overtime
touchdowns in 2001 and set up the Bears' 2002 opening win over
Minnesota with a last-minute interception.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for Brown, the football gods are easily distracted.
Bored with this premise, the gods turned their attention to Marty
Schottenheimer and Chad Pennington, leaving Brown and the Bears to
fend for themselves. In their last 11 games, Brown and the Bears are
2-9.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Frontiere Curse</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the football gods took a lengthy sabbatical, figuring the
league was in safe hands with Favre and Peyton Manning. Upon their
return, to their horror, they saw Georgia Frontiere hoisting the
Lombardi Trophy on the Super Bowl victory podium, prompting them to
bow their heads and solemnly vow: Never again.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Warner and Marshall Faulk missed a combined seven games
because of injury and the Rams barely scraped into the playoffs as a
10-6 wild card. In the Rams' first-round playoff game against New
Orleans, Az-Zahir Hakim mysteriously fumbled a punt late in the
fourth quarter and the Saints -- previously winless in the playoffs
-- held on for a 31-28 victory.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the Rams rolled through the regular season 14-2, pounded
the Packers and the Eagles in the playoffs ... and lost the Super
Bowl to 14-point underdog New England.</TE>
<TE>   It took nine months for the Rams to win again. After an 0-4
exhibition season and an 0-4 September, St. Louis went 5-0 behind
third-string quarterback Marc Bulger, then went 0-2 with Warner and
now are 5-7, with Jamie Martin starting today against Kansas City

<TE>   Dwayne Rudd Curse</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland Browns have been cursed ever since Rudd, an
excitable sixth-year linebacker, committed the ultimate act of hubris
-- spiking his helmet in celebration before the final play of the
Browns' season opener against Kansas City had finished, resulting in
an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty and a field goal that turned a
certain Cleveland victory into defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Browns have:</TE>
<TE>   * Lost to Pittsburgh in overtime after blocking a field goal too
well and too soon, allowing the Steelers to recover on second down
and try the field goal again on third, this time resulting in a
Steeler victory.</TE>
<TE>   * Fallen behind Chris Redman and the Baltimore Ravens, 23-0, in an
eventual 26-21 home defeat.</TE>
<TE>   * Lost again to Pittsburgh after blowing a 14-3 lead at home and
watching Tommy Maddox come off the bench to spark a 23-20 Steeler
rally.</TE>
<TE>   * Failed to score a touchdown at home against Carolina and lost,
13-6, to a Panther team that began the game on an eight-game losing
streak.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coliseum Curse</TE>
<TE>   Since 1950, five professional football teams have called the Los
Angeles Coliseum their home. Today, none does.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the former Coliseum dwellers -- the Rams, Raiders and
Chargers -- now play their home games in St. Louis, Oakland and San
Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The two others -- the Express and the Xtreme -- are extinct.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Heisman Trophy Curse</TE>
<TE>   Well-documented curse in which the recipient of college football's
most hallowed prize usually fades into oblivion once his professional
career begins. Most recent case: Eric Crouch, who won the Heisman in
2001 and retired before playing a regular-season game with St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Other recent victims include Chris Weinke, Heisman 2000; Ron
Dayne, 1999; Danny Wuerffel, 1996; Rashaan Salaam, 1994; Gino
Torretta, 1992; Ty Detmer, 1990; and Andre Ware, 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Since Marcus Allen, who won in 1981, the only Heisman recipient to
play for a Super Bowl champion has been Desmond Howard, who won the
Heisman Trophy in 1991 and the Lombardi Trophy with Green Bay five
years later.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stanley Cup Curse</TE>
<TE>   Sure recipe for NFL failure: Play your home games in a city that
just won the Stanley Cup.</TE>
<TE>   2002: Detroit Red Wings win the Cup; Detroit Lions open 3-9.</TE>
<TE>   2001: Colorado Avalanche wins the Cup; Denver Broncos go 8-8, miss
the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   2000: New Jersey Devils win the Cup; New York Jets go 9-7 and miss
the playoffs, New York Giants lose the Super Bowl to Trent Dilfer by
27 points.</TE>
<TE>   1999: Dallas Stars win the Cup; Dallas Cowboys go 8-8 and get
blown out by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   1998: Red Wings win the Cup; Lions go 5-11.</TE>

<HD>Uniform Response to Raider Rooters</HD>
<DH>A beefed-up police and security force steels itself for
annual influx of rowdy Oakland fans today in San Diego.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>They're big, aggressive, unpredictable and in love with
their hard-hitting, hard-living, outlaw image. And today, they'll
descend on Qualcomm Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   No, not the Oakland Raiders. Well, yes, them too. But more to the
point: the Oakland Raider fans, Raider Nation, that collection of
die-hard loyalists that prides itself on being the loudest, rowdiest
bunch of fans in the NFL.</LD>
<LD>   It's become a San Diego tradition in the week before the
Raider-Charger game: Police vowing that this year they are not going
to tolerate public drunkenness and violence.</LD>
<TE>   Today, there will be twice as many police and three times as many
security guards as at a regular game. Fans will be patted down at the
turnstiles and Raider fan costumes that might be used as weapons --
spiky helmets and shoulder pads, for example -- will be confiscated.</TE>
<TE>   Beer and wine sales will be suspended after halftime. Thirty
surveillance cameras will scan the crowd. And a portable booking
facility will be set up in the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   "We've learned from the past," said Police Lt. Mike Cash. "We're
going to be tough on tailgate parties and drinking. And we're not
giving warnings. We're not tolerating things getting out of hand."</TE>
<TE>   After a near riot three years ago between Raider and Charger fans,
police beefed up security for the next showdown.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, even with added police, a Raider fan stabbed a
Charger fan. The Raider fan was later convicted and sentenced to five
years in prison. Last year, more than 100 arrests were made for
drunkenness and fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Charger officials are promising more gates so that the pat-downs
do not hinder the movement of fans into the stadium. Long lines
caused some pregame agitation last year.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of disgruntled fans," said Ken Derrett, the
Chargers' vice president for marketing. "This year, egress will be
more orderly."</TE>
<TE>   Civic concern about possible trouble is heightened by the fact the
game is meaningful, with the Raiders and Chargers tied for the lead
in the AFC West at 8-4.</TE>
<TE>   In October, the Chargers beat the Raiders at Oakland, 27-21 in
overtime, and Charger safety Rodney Harrison was later suspended for
one game for having allegedly taken a cheap shot at Raider receiver
Jerry Rice.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison has always brought out a special animus in Raider fans.
Two years ago he was fined $40,000 for an alleged dirty hit on Raider
tight end Jeremy Brigham.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison's history, and the high stakes of the game, have raised
concern here that some Raider fans might experience difficulty with
impulse control and that Charger fans might respond in kind, a
combustible combination.</TE>
<TE>   Some Raider fans from Southern California are known to travel to
Oakland or even to some road games. But for many, the San Diego game
is their only opportunity to act out their devotion to the team that
departed Los Angeles in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "This year, we're really going to give the Chargers and their
wimpy fans what-for," vowed Jerry Martinez, a Norwalk construction
worker and Raider fan who says he would not miss the game "even if my
own funeral were scheduled for that day."</TE>
<TE>   One commentator, only slightly tongue-in-cheek, has suggested that
Charger fans skip the game to avoid the crude language, fighting and
general belligerence.</TE>
<TE>   "What is it about some of these football fans anyway? Frustrated
linebackers?" said Cliff Albert of KOGO radio.</TE>
<TE>   There is a new political element to this year's game. Off-duty San
Diego police officers will be picketing the stadium entrances, hoping
to draw attention to their salary dispute with City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   What is unknown is how Raider fans, who flaunt their
anti-authoritarian spirit, will react to a picket line of police.</TE>
<TE>   "One of our signs is going to say, 'Honk if you support the San
Diego Police,' " said Bill Farrar, president of the San Diego Police
Officers Assn. "We'll see if they flip us the bird."</TE>

<HD>Apparently, Screaming Is All Jackson Can Hear</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I would imagine when this miracle season is over, the Lakers have won
a fourth title in a row and Phil Jackson is writing his book, "It
Wasn't Michael, It Wasn't Shaq, It Wasn't Kobe -- This Time It Was
All Me," the truth will finally come out.</LD>
<LD>   At this time, of course, we're only left to speculate after the
Lakers' jarring turnaround against Dallas and read between the lines
when he says: "Undoubtedly, it's an emotional lift [for] a team
that's been playing under duress," from the ridicule heaped upon them
by "sportscasters and from fans alike."</LD>
<LD>   I'm not surprised, of course, that it took the sportscasters and
fans to get a sign of life out of the Lakers, just that the former
sitting Bull admitted as much.</LD>
<TE>   The reference to "sportscasters" is a pretty good hint how Jackson
motivated the Lakers for Friday night's showdown, undoubtedly taking
his team behind closed doors to torture them and make them watch
ESPN's scream-fest, "Around the Horn."</TE>
<TE>   (I'd guess most people watch "Around the Horn" behind closed doors
because I can't imagine anyone wanting anyone to know they watch such
nonsense.)</TE>
<TE>   However, speaking as one of the "sportscasters" who has agreed to
humiliate himself on that show in order to pay for a wedding, I
suggested on Friday's yell-a-thon that it was time for "Phil to get
off his butt and start coaching."</TE>
<TE>   I wasn't worried about getting Phil angry, of course, because I
took for granted he'd be off somewhere chanting, painting his
toenails, burning incense or whatever he does to get ready for a
game.</TE>
<TE>   I added, "I think Phil is scared," because he's at his coaching
best when he doesn't have to do any coaching, but now he might not
have enough talent to look good without doing something. I mocked the
Lakers' supporting cast, which reminds me of the bottom of the
Dodgers' lineup, which I suppose would constitute ridicule being
heaped upon the Laker stiffs.</TE>
<TE>   I used the same technique on the Angels early on, calling them all
boring, and by season's end they were appearing on Leno with David
Eckstein visiting the White House. Shawn Green had more strikeouts
than hits when I started calling him names, and then he set the
record for most bases in one game. I got Kobe Bryant to shoot
three-pointers almost as well as my daughter, and I probably deserve
credit more than anyone for bringing passion back to USC football.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LAST WEEK I went to work on Jackson, telling him it was time to
start coaching, but it was as if I were talking to Curly after just
getting boxed in the ears by Moe. I've seen that Three Stooges look
before from the wife's brothers, Bubba I, Bubba II and Bubba III, but
I also know how much time they spend in front of TV, and if someone
on TV says something, they accept it as the gospel according to Dick
Vitale or Jillian Barberie.</TE>
<TE>   So I'm not surprised it took a "sportscaster" talking tough to
turn the Lakers around, although I'm sure Jackson will take credit
when he writes that book. But let's face it, before Friday's TV slap
in the face, Jackson was 0 for 10 in making winning adjustments at
halftime. But now he's one for 11, and everyone is talking about the
heart of champion, as if that had anything to do with it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE LAKERS are still in trouble. They play today against Utah, and
the next episode of "Around the Horn" isn't until Monday. I won't be
surprised if they lose to the Jazz.</TE>
<TE>   There's reason for concern. There are going to be days when The
Times isn't represented on "Around the Horn," and with the Lakers so
far back in the standings, I worry there aren't going to be enough
chances to poke fun at Phil and the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THIS IS where the fans must do their part. You already know that
Jackson &amp; Co. pay attention to the screaming yahoos who ridicule the
champs for playing like chumps. Jackson said so after the Dallas win.</TE>
<TE>   Last week he admitted a fan yelled at him to start coaching, and
he wouldn't have brought it up if he didn't have rabbit ears. He
wears earplugs to avoid hearing the cowbells, but I say Laker fans
should stay on him until he's forced to stick them in his ears for
home games -- the earplugs, that is.</TE>
<TE>   If the fans and sportscasters don't ridicule the Lakers, they'll
fall flat again. That's the only thing that has gotten their
attention to date. Kobe yelled at his teammates and it didn't make a
difference. Shaq yelled at his teammates and nothing changed. The
sportscasters and fans began to ridicule the Lakers and they staged
the largest fourth-quarter rally in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   We all have some work to do, so Phil can get back to doing what he
does best, which is nothing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I WENT to the fights at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas on Saturday
night because I heard 6-foot-7 Wladimir Klitschko had knocked out
Phil Jackson. I had no idea it wasn't that Phil Jackson, though, so
what a disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   Before the heavyweight bout, Floyd Mayweather Jr. defended his
title but failed to keep my attention. I will say on my card, though,
I had the ring girl in the third, sixth, ninth and 12th rounds
winning decisively. She showed more than Mayweather.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Ralph Johnson:</TE>
<TE>   "You are the most biased, bigoted, sports writer on the planet,
and even when you make an apology, it's followed by something
derogatory."</TE>
<TE>   I'm sorry you feel that way. I think I could probably grow to like
you if you were the last person on earth.</TE>

<DH>Gesser has an outstanding game despite injured ankle, while
UCLA's second consecutive rout at home could cost Toledo his job.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the game with the national implications of Alan Greenspan cutting
interest rates, a 23-year-old Washington State quarterback with a
badly sprained ankle and a 56-year-old UCLA coach with an unsteady
foothold on his job were a study in contrasts.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Gesser emerged as sturdy as Bob Toledo is wobbly.</LD>
<LD>   Gesser left the field jubilant, carrying a single red rose.</LD>
<TE>   Toledo departed, head bowed, under the escort of eight police
officers.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the Rose Bowl crowd of 56,335 had headed home by that
time, oddly ambivalent about the 48-27 Washington State victory in a
Pacific 10 Conference finale Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Many UCLA fans wanted their team to lose, either because the
possibility of a Holiday Bowl berth is better than going to the
Insight Bowl or because the defeat might trigger the dismissal of
Toledo -- a coach in disfavor since a 52-21 loss to USC two weeks
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Those fans were as pleased as some USC followers were
disappointed. A UCLA victory would have sent the Trojans to the Rose
Bowl. Instead, it is the Cougars who earned a return trip to
Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people wanted us to lose, that felt weird all week,"
Bruin tight end Mike Seidman said. "To have Trojan people pulling for
us, that was the strangest of all. To think they were the only ones
who wanted us to win."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, there were others -- the entire bowl championship series
and Notre Dame, for starters.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, Bruin players.</TE>
<TE>   Several seniors walked off fighting tears. Their team exceeded
expectations with a 7-5 record and a tie for fourth in the Pacific 10
Conference, but they surrendered 100 points in the last two games on
their home field.</TE>
<TE>   After the loss to USC, the Bruins hailed Carson Palmer. This time
they marveled at Gesser, who started despite wearing a white custom
brace on his right ankle in the shape of a question mark.</TE>
<TE>   By game's end, it was more like an exclamation point. Gesser
completed 15 of 24 passes for 247 yards and two touchdowns -- both in
the first half, when the Cougars (10-2) built a 31-21 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the toughest guy in college football," UCLA cornerback
Ricky Manning Jr. said. "As bad as he was limping, it's unbelievable
what he did. Washington State is lucky to have a leader like him."</TE>
<TE>   Manning did his best to force Gesser out on a running play nine
minutes into the game with UCLA ahead, 14-7. As tailback Jermaine
Green tried to reverse his field, Gesser found himself leading the
blocking and Manning torpedoed the quarterback's ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser's pass on the next play was almost intercepted and reserve
quarterback Matt Kegel was sent in on third down. Gesser, who already
had an interception by Bruin safety Ben Emanuel returned for a
touchdown, tugged at his chinstrap in disgust and tried to wave off
Kegel.</TE>
<TE>   "They brought me out and I was yelling at the [coaches]," Gesser
said. "But I was able to go right back in."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed he did. On Washington State's next possession, he directed
a 94-yard touchdown drive, completing four passes, including one of
eight yards to Devard Darling for the tying score.</TE>
<TE>   In an unwitting touch of irony, the UCLA band began playing "Iron
Man" as Gesser returned to the field.</TE>
<TE>   "When Ricky made that hit, I said, 'He's out,' " Bruin linebacker
Marcus Reese said. "I thought for sure he was gone. So he deserves
every accolade he gets."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA, which scored another early touchdown on a 55-yard reverse
pass by receiver Jon Dubravac to running back Manuel White, was
nearly helpless offensively. Freshman quarterback Drew Olson rarely
had time to throw and tailback Tyler Ebell found little room to run,
gaining 10 yards in nine carries.</TE>
<TE>   So when the special teams caved in during the second quarter,
Washington State made its move. Marcus Trufant returned a punt 37
yards to give the Cougars the ball on the UCLA 22, and two plays
later Gesser connected with Jerome Riley for a 21-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   A fumble on the kickoff by Matt Clark led to a Cougar field goal
and a 24-14 lead, and on UCLA's next possession Jason David
intercepted an Olson pass and gave Washington State the ball at the
UCLA six.</TE>
<TE>   John Tippins was wide open on a fake field goal, but kicker Drew
Dunning underthrew him, allowing UCLA to escape damage until Green
took a draw play 80 yards for a touchdown with 48 seconds left in the
half.</TE>
<TE>   Miscommunication on Washington State's kickoff allowed UCLA to
stay close, however. Adam Holiday mistakenly thought Coach Mike Price
told him to make an onside kick, and the ball went only five yards.</TE>
<TE>   Olson made his first big play, hitting freshman receiver Junior
Taylor down the sideline for a 39-yard touchdown to cut the deficit
to 31-21 at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   "We were in the game," Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Toledo didn't breathe a word to his team at halftime, he
knew that the second half could determine whether he returns for an
eighth season. No matter that his record is 49-32. Or that the Bruins
are 3-2 since losing senior quarterback Cory Paus. Or that USC and
Washington State are clearly better, more experienced teams.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins made one first down and punted on their first
possession but escaped damage when Manning blocked a field goal.</TE>
<TE>   After punting on their next possession, however, they weren't so
fortunate. Adam Braidwood blocked Nate Fikse's kick, giving the
Cougars the ball at the UCLA 15. Tippins scored from one yard and the
rout was on, 38-21.</TE>
<TE>   Olson, who completed 13 of 27 passes for 163 yards and two
interceptions, threw his second touchdown pass -- a screen that
Seidman took 27 yards -- late in the third quarter. But Erik Coleman
returned an interception 25 yards for the last Cougar score with
10:20 left.</TE>
<TE>   Only when the outcome was cemented did Gesser limp off the field
for the last time.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just remarkable what Jason did," Price said. "He's got to
be the MVP of Washington State football history."</TE>
<TE>   Gesser can now rest up for the Rose Bowl. Toledo, however, will be
on pins and needles until he meets with Athletic Director Dan
Guerrero on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero, who is in his first year, refused since the USC game to
comment on Toledo's status and declined to give the coach a vote of
confidence after the game Saturday. However, he said he has not
decided whether to fire him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still evaluating," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To make a change, Guerrero might need the approval of Chancellor
Albert Carnesale, who told Toledo after last season that his job
would be safe if the team posted a winning record and off-the-field
problems were kept to a minimum.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo said he plans to point out that the young team's best days
are ahead and that he wants to remain a part of it. And he admitted
that the endless speculation on his job status was a distraction.</TE>
<TE>   "It had a big effect on the psyche of the team," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Indications are that Guerrero won't allow the uncertainty to
linger. The team will find out today which bowl game it will play in,
and will conduct practices after finals are over next week knowing
whether Toledo will be back.</TE>
<TE>   As for Gesser and the Cougars, they are certain to return -- on
New Year's Day. Their bus was stuck in traffic Friday night en route
to the team walk-through and took 90 minutes to reach the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we pulled up outside and they had that Rose Bowl sign all
lit up," defensive tackle Jeremey Williams said, "we knew it was our
destiny."</TE>

<TE>   In two games, UCLA went from having a chance to earn a Rose Bowl
berth to finishing in a four-way tie for fourth place in the Pac-10
and settling for a lower-tier bowl game. Shoddy play on defense was a
big reason for the Bruins' lopsided losses in their last two games:</TE>

<HD>Bruins' Loss Is Bitter for Trojans, but It May Leave a
Sweet Aftertaste</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC offensive linemen met at midfield after practice Saturday and
gave a cheer probably never heard at Howard Jones Field.</LD>
<LD>   "Go Bruins!" they yelled in unison before breaking up with
laughter.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans retired to their dining hall for lunch, then spent the
afternoon at various locales watching or listening to UCLA's game
against Washington State. A Bruin victory would have assured
fifth-ranked USC its first Rose Bowl appearance since the 1995
season.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, Washington State's 48-27 victory put the Cougars in the
Rose Bowl and forced USC to wait another day to learn its bowl fate.
The Trojans expect an invitation to either the Sugar Bowl or the
Orange Bowl when the bowl championship series matchups are announced
today.</TE>
<TE>   "We would have loved to have gone to the Rose Bowl, but Washington
State had their chance to rightfully earn it and they did a great
job," USC Coach Pete Carroll. "We'll look forward to see what the
word is."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Garrett, USC's athletic director, said he is fairly certain
that USC will be selected for the Sugar Bowl. "That's the most likely
thing that will happen," Garrett said. "The Sugar Bowl people have
treated us well from the start and they seemed eager to have us come
to their game."</TE>
<TE>   If the Trojans play in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans on Jan. 1, it
will be against fourth-ranked Georgia, which defeated Arkansas, 30-3,
in the Southeastern Conference title game Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said he has fond memories of games in New Orleans when he
was an NFL assistant with the Minnesota Vikings and San Francisco
49ers.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the atmosphere down there. It's a great place to play a
bowl game," Carroll said. "It's a great place to spend New Year's."</TE>
<TE>   USC began the day with a slight chance of ascending to the Fiesta
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   But top-ranked Miami's 56-45 victory over Virginia Tech eliminated
any possibility that the Trojans could play Ohio State for the
national title. It did, however, guarantee the Trojans their first
berth in a BCS game.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl was USC's first choice, so Trojan players and
coaches were hoping that UCLA could overcome seventh-ranked
Washington State and quarterback Jason Gesser, who played despite a
high ankle sprain.</TE>
<TE>   "I was yelling at the TV the whole time," senior offensive lineman
Zach Wilson said. "I was going, 'Tackle! Tackle! Hit that guy on the
ankle!' "</TE>
<TE>   Said senior center Derek Graf: "It was weird rooting for UCLA, but
it was for a good cause."</TE>
<TE>   Cornerback Darrell Rideaux said he and other seniors were
disappointed that they would not play in Pasadena on New Year's Day.
But the feeling was tempered by the opportunity to play in another
BCS game.</TE>
<TE>   "We still get to be showcased on a national level," Rideaux said.
"We're excited to learn where we're going and we'll all be on
speed-dial to each other when we find out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman linebacker Oscar Lua hurt his right knee during practice
and will undergo tests to determine the extent of the injury.</TE>

<HD>Trojans Get Caught in a Stagnation State</HD>
<DH>Basketball team can't protect 11-point lead and loses to
No. 15 Missouri, 78-72, in Wooden Classic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC was rolling.</LD>
<LD>   The young and rebuilding Trojans had ridden the wave of confusion
their myriad of defenses elicited from Missouri to an 11-point
second-half lead and seemed primed to pull off a Wooden Classic
upset.</LD>
<LD>   But then complacency, which led to a breakdown on defense, foul
trouble and cold shooting, entered the Trojan mind-set and never
left, enabling the 15th-ranked Tigers to rally for a 78-72 victory
Saturday at the Arrowhead Pond.</LD>
<TE>   "I was scared that would happen," said USC sophomore shooting
guard Errick Craven. "We've got a lot of new guys and you think with
a big lead that [it's over]. We were not playing the same way [after
we got the lead]. Guys would hold the ball and we got stagnant.</TE>
<TE>   "We held the ball to win the game instead of just playing. We were
playing the time."</TE>
<TE>   Time, and the Tigers, caught up with the Trojans in front of
9,889.</TE>
<TE>   And as a result, the Trojans (2-3) have a losing record for the
first time since opening the 1999-2000 season 2-3 after falling to
Duke in that year's Wooden Classic.</TE>
<TE>   But USC Coach Henry Bibby was not down on his team.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we played well," he said. "I was pleased with the
effort. If the effort is there and the kids are working hard,
whatever happens in the game, happens.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, we were playing a team with two NBA players on it tonight
and we had a chance to win."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans seemed intimidated in the early going by Missouri,
which advanced to the Elite Eight of last year's NCAA tournament, and
trailed, 12-4, six minutes into the game.</TE>
<TE>   That's when USC began showing flashes of the defensive dexterity
that flummoxed Pacific 10 teams at the end of last season.</TE>
<TE>   With looks of doubt beginning to appear on their opponents' faces,
the Trojans thrived on a steady diet of steals and Missouri
turnovers, limiting the Tigers to one field goal over a 5:47 stretch.</TE>
<TE>   With all three of their junior college transfers -- point guard
Brandon Brooks, shooting guard/small forward Roy Smiley and center
Jonathan Oliver -- on the floor, the Trojans led by nine points
before settling for a 39-34 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   An Oliver basket with 14:49 to play stretched the Trojans'
advantage to 11, 53-42, but all that did was set the stage for the
Tigers' comeback.</TE>
<TE>   "They were shooting the ball and our minds just wandered," said
USC's Derrick Craven, who had eight points, an assist and two
turnovers in his first college start at point guard. "We stopped
playing defense."</TE>
<TE>   Errick Craven said it was also a matter of the Tigers solving the
Trojans' defensive looks.</TE>
<TE>   "In the second half, they started swinging the ball," he said,
"and we weren't able to rotate fast enough, so we'd have our big men
on their point guard. They picked up on that and that gave them the
open threes."</TE>
<TE>   Missouri knocked down six three-pointers in the second half, to
one for USC.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans also had trouble keeping centers Oliver, Kostas
Charissis and Rory O'Neil on the floor. They were in constant foul
trouble; O'Neil picked up his fourth foul in the final minute of the
first half, and Charissis and Oliver fouled out, with 9:28 and 2:24
to play, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Such was USC's lot against Missouri's big man, junior Arthur
Johnson, who had 24 points and 12 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   And at the same time Missouri (4-0) began warming up from the
outside, USC went cold, its shot selection becoming suspect. In the
second half the Trojans shot 31.6% from the field while Missouri was
at 51.7%.</TE>
<TE>   "Once they'd make a shot, we'd go down and put one up in a rush,"
said junior guard Desmon Farmer, who led the Trojans with 16 points
off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers started scoring in a rush against the suddenly unnerved
Trojans and tied the score at 60-60 on a Johnson basket with nine
minutes to play.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers went up by 67-63 on Rickey Paulding's three-pointer
with 6:03 remaining but the Trojans answered with a 6-0 run that
ended with a Farmer basket at the 4:33 mark. The resulting 69-67
advantage was the last lead the Trojans would enjoy.</TE>
<TE>   "We're playing together," Farmer said. "A lot of people thought we
were selfish but I think tonight we showed we could play together."</TE>
<TE>   At least for 35 minutes.</TE>

<DH>Second-year Falcon quarterback sensation Vick already being
called the Michael Jordan of the NFL</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Wharton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga.</DL>
<LD>It was the first time in months that anyone could say Michael Vick
looked slow, shuffling across the locker room in slippers, shaking
his head.</LD>
<LD>   "Not so good," he said.</LD>
<LD>   All season long, defensive ends had chased him and linebackers had
blitzed to no avail. A nasty stomach flu, that's what it took to
finally hobble the Atlanta Falcon wunderkind last week.</LD>
<TE>   "Throwing up, headache, cold sweats," he explained in a voice even
quieter than his usual half-whisper.</TE>
<TE>   The virus could not have struck at a worse time, the Falcons
preparing for a showdown with their division rivals, the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers. At the team's training camp, a cluster of modern brick
buildings set in the pines halfway to South Carolina, Coach Dan
Reeves spoke of "trying to get some medicine in him and some IV's."
Reporters crowded around his locker.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to eat a little bit," he said. "My goal is to get
myself back to 100% and get back to feeling normal."</TE>
<TE>   With this young man, normal is a highly relative term.</TE>
<TE>   In his first season as a starter, Vick has transformed the Falcons
into surprise contenders by showing glimpses of quarterback play
unlike anything the NFL has seen.</TE>
<TE>   He combines a slingshot for a left arm with speed that Carolina
Panther linebacker Will Witherspoon calls "pretty close to a
cheetah." Though he was a No. 1 draft pick, no one expected him to be
this good, this soon.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents have already begun to refer to him as the Michael Jordan
of football.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to understand this guy is changing the game," Minnesota
Viking linebacker Henri Crockett said. "He's got the same attributes
that John Elway had, just five-tenths of a second faster."</TE>
<TE>   High praise for a 22-year-old who should be a senior at Virginia
Tech this season.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Vick flaunts his newfound status. He is somewhat
disarming off the field, not particularly lithe or sleek, with a
build that skews toward blockish.</TE>
<TE>   His personality also defies expectation, no masses of jewelry or
end zone dances, no referring to himself in the third person.
Instead, he speaks of being blessed, something he says he lies awake
at night pondering. Game by game, his confidence grows with the
discovery of what can be accomplished.</TE>
<TE>   "When I take off and I'm in full stride, the game seems so slow,"
he said. "I think that I can make any play."</TE>
<TE>   That, so far, is the secret to his success.</TE>
<TE>   Though Vick has rushed for 662 yards -- including an NFL-record
173 against the Vikings last week -- his quarterback rating is an
inauspicious 87.1 with only 10 touchdown passes. He isn't about
statistics. Not yet. He shines in luminous bursts.</TE>
<TE>   A 44-yard touchdown run against Carolina. A 76-yard,
flick-of-the-wrist scoring pass against New Orleans. At Pittsburgh,
he finished an unlikely comeback with an 11-yard touchdown scramble
in the final seconds for the tying score.</TE>
<TE>   "Once he gets in that zone," Atlanta receiver Shawn Jefferson
said, "he just takes over the game."</TE>
<TE>   At no point was that more evident than last week's showcase
against the Vikings when, after scoring on a 39-yard pass and 28-yard
run, Vick produced the play of the season. Break it down:</TE>
<TE>   First came quickness. With the game in overtime, Vick dropped back
and sensed pressure. He shuffle-stepped left, took a few strides and
escaped from the pocket untouched.</TE>
<TE>   Next came smarts. The defense was in man coverage, its collective
back turned, so Vick realized he had room to run.</TE>
<TE>   Add a move. Crossing midfield and streaking to the 30-yard line,
he dipped left and steered right, distancing himself from three guys
on his heels. But two more defenders had an angle, closing in from
either side.</TE>
<TE>   Finally the magic, the quality that distinguishes Vick from every
other quarterback on the planet. He found another gear -- a teammate
calls it his "invisible juice" -- and slipped between the tacklers,
leaving them to collide like bad slapstick.</TE>
<TE>   If the run looked spectacular on television, listen to those who
saw it close up.</TE>
<TE>   "We're amazed too," Atlanta fullback Bob Christian said.
"Sometimes you have to keep from stopping in the middle of a play and
just watching and saying 'Wow.' "</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Falcons worry that Vick's traveling highlight show
might distract from his development. As quarterback coach Jack Burns
explained, "We don't want him to be a run-around schoolyard
quarterback, we want him to be the total package."</TE>
<TE>   They want Vick to run wisely and limit the hits that could land
him on the sideline. His completion rate has risen to 57% -- accuracy
was a question mark when he came out of college -- but when coaches
see him throw on the run, off his back foot, generating velocity with
only his arm, they think he can be even better with sharper
mechanics.</TE>
<TE>   If he can hone that combination of speed and skill, instinct and
experience, the true magic of Michael Vick might emerge.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't put a limit on him at all," Tampa Bay defensive
lineman Simeon Rice said. "He's taking his offense to another
dimension."</TE>
<TE>   Or, as former quarterback and current television commentator Terry
Bradshaw said: "He does things differently from other players."</TE>
<TE>   This week, Vick even outfoxed the flu, looking fit at practice a
day later.</TE>
<TE>   He has been waiting two months for this morning's rematch with the
Buccaneers (9-3), who knocked him out of the game with a sprained
shoulder and defeated his team, 20-6, in the Georgia Dome in October.</TE>
<TE>   For the Falcons (8-3-1) to win this time, on the road no less,
Vick figures he must summon the best performance of his brief career.
He grins from behind half-lidded eyes and quietly jokes about his
team's three-pronged strategy: "Plan A is run. Plan B is pass. Plan C
is me."</TE>
<TE>   It is the jest of a young man who is finding his way in the NFL
and knows he is on a hot streak. "You can almost feel it at the start
of the game ... like you can't miss," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That should be enough to make any defense feel queasy.</TE>

<LD>For Luke Ridnour, it was like March in December. Only better.</LD>
<LD>   Ridnour had 25 points, nine assists and seven rebounds as No. 7
Oregon avenged last season's NCAA tournament loss with an 84-78
victory over No. 14 Kansas on Saturday at Portland, Ore.</LD>
<LD>   "This was like a March game," Ridnour marveled. "It will be good
for us down the road."</LD>
<TE>   Luke Jackson had 26 points and nine rebounds for the Ducks (5-0),
who fought off a second-half Kansas rally.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Hinrich led the Jayhawks (3-3) with 24 points and Keith
Langford added 21 in the rematch, played before 20,762 at Portland's
Rose Garden Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, the teams met in the Midwest Regional final in
Madison, Wis., and Kansas emerged with a 104-86 victory and its first
trip to the Final Four since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, who led by only four at the half, stretched their lead
to as many as 11, but the Jayhawks came back to tie it at 74 on
Langford's layup with 3:39 left. But Oregon pulled away, going on a
10-2 run that was punctuated by Ridnour's three-point basket and a
foul shot that made it 84-76 with 49.6 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas' Nick Collison, who had 25 points and 15 rebounds in last
year's game between the teams, got into early foul trouble early and
finished with seven points and four rebounds in 24 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 Arizona 89, San Diego State 81 -- Will Bynum scored 19
points as the Wildcats (4-0) won at San Diego State (2-3). It was the
narrowest margin of victory this season for Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 Texas 100, George Washington 92 -- James Thomas scored a
career-high 26 points and led two second-half runs as the Longhorns
(5-0) won at Washington and advanced to play in the final against
Notre Dame in the BB&amp;T Classic.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame 79, No. 9 Maryland 67 -- Freshman Torin Francis scored
20 points on eight-for-eight shooting to lead the Fighting Irish
(7-1) at Washington. Steve Blake scored 15 points for the Terrapins
(3-2).</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Alabama 77, St. Bonaventure 68 -- Erwin Dudley tied a career
high with 28 points to lead Alabama (6-0) to a school-record 23rd
straight home victory. St. Bonaventure is 2-4.</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Duke 81, Michigan 59 -- Daniel Ewing and Dahntay Jones had
17 points each as the Blue Devils (5-0) won at Durham, N.C. It was
the second matchup between Michigan Coach Tommy Amaker, a former Duke
player and assistant coach, and Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski.</TE>
<TE>   No. 5 Pittsburgh 82, Penn State 60 -- Donatas Zavackas had 20
points to help Pittsburgh (5-0) win at State College, Pa. Penn State
is off to an 0-5 start, the first time that has happened since 1931.</TE>
<TE>   No. 6 Oklahoma 92, Hartford 52 -- Ebi Ere scored a career-high 33
points for the host Sooners (4-1).</TE>

<HD>Marshall, Leftwich Put Away Toledo</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A month's worth of limping on a sore shin didn't deter Byron
Leftwich, and neither did getting flattened by Toledo's David
Gardner.</LD>
<LD>   Leftwich got up from the third-quarter hit to throw two late
touchdowns, including a 40-yarder to Darius Watts with 49 seconds
left, as Marshall beat Toledo, 49-45, Saturday in the Mid-American
Conference championship game at Huntington, W.Va.</LD>
<LD>   Marshall (10-2) has won five MAC titles since it rejoined the
league six seasons ago.</LD>
<TE>   The Thundering Herd avoided losing at home for only the second
time since Bob Pruett became coach in 1996. Marshall atoned for a
loss at Toledo in last year's championship game, in which the Rockets
overcame a 23-0 deficit to win, 41-36.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, after we lost we all had a sick feeling," Leftwich
said. "This year, we couldn't let them come in here and make us feel
like that again."</TE>
<TE>   Leftwich completed 32 of 42 passes for 404 yards and four
touchdowns to overshadow the four rushing touchdowns by Toledo
redshirt freshman Trinity Dawson, who finished with a career-high 130
yards.</TE>
<TE>   Leftwich hurt his left shin on Nov. 2. On Saturday, he showed his
toughness as Toledo made good on its promise to blitz him often.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner thought his hit, which came after an interception by
Brandon Hefflin, was legal. But it came just after the whistle,
prompting a personal-foul penalty and setting off a fight. Marshall
lineman Steve Peretta went after Gardner, and Toledo lineman Lantz
Jeudy retaliated against Peretta.</TE>
<TE>   Several Toledo players rushed onto the field, and players from
both teams exchanged shoves before order was restored. Peretta and
Jeudy were ejected.</TE>
<TE>   "He hit me high, so honestly, it wasn't dirty," Leftwich said. "It
was unfortunate that the fight may have taken something away from the
game."</TE>
<TE>   Both teams had secured bowl bids before Saturday. Marshall will
head to the GMAC Bowl on Dec. 18 in Mobile, Ala., and Toledo (9-4)
will play in the Motor City Bowl on Dec. 26 in Detroit.</TE>

<LD>Matt Taylor's first career hat trick highlighted an explosion of six
second-half goals for the UCLA men's soccer team, which advanced to
the NCAA College Cup with a 7-1 victory over Penn State before 1,548
Saturday night at Drake Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins (16-3-3) overcame their first deficit of the postseason
and continued their torrid scoring pace that included 17 goals in the
last four games. They advance to a semifinal Friday against Maryland
at Gerald Ford Stadium at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Pierce gave UCLA a 2-1 lead in the 52nd minute with an assist
from Taylor. Pierce scored again five minutes later with an assist
from Taylor and Adolfo Gregorio.</LD>
<TE>   Taylor, who finished with three assists, scored his first two
goals in a five-minute span, the first a sliding left-footed kick
from a few feet away on an assist from Cliff McKinley.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce leads the Bruins with 12 goals. Taylor extended his total
to 11. Jimmy Frazelle and Gregorio also scored for UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "Our team has a lot of good offensive players," Pierce said.
"Teams can't really zone in on any one particular guy. We can attack
from all over the place. Things are really rolling right now."</TE>
<TE>   Penn State (16-8) took a 1-0 lead on David Walter's goal three
minutes into the game. The Bruins tied it in the 25th minute on a
penalty kick by Gregorio. The kick came after Penn State goalkeeper
Ryan Sickman was ejected after colliding with McKinley, who was
attempting to score on a breakaway.</TE>

<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>There are sweet words and there is the sweet science. But they don't
always mesh.</LD>
<LD>   For Floyd Mayweather Jr., life outside the ring has been bitter,
angry, unfulfilling. Once he steps between the ropes, however, life
can be a breeze, all sweetness and satisfaction as it was on Saturday
night at the Mandalay Bay Events Center.</LD>
<LD>   For Wladimir Klitschko, life outside the ring has been a
publicist's dream, a journey that has taken him from the bleakness of
the Ukraine to the bright lights of a world stage where he has become
a powerful spokesman for needy children around the globe. Inside the
ropes, however, the promise remains unfulfilled, a work in progress
that still needs lots of work, as was demonstrated even in victory
Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Mayweather, who spent the days leading up to the fight feuding
with everyone from his promoter to television officials, put on a
masterful performance in front of a crowd of 6,580, defending the
World Boxing Council lightweight title he won last spring from Jose
Luis Castillo with an impressive performance that earned him a
unanimous decision in Saturday night's rematch.</TE>
<TE>   Klitschko defended his World Boxing Organization heavyweight title
by stopping Jameel McCline on a 10th-round TKO in a dull,
unimpressive performance that elicited boos from the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   In improving to 29-0 with 20 knockouts, Mayweather was smoother
and more effective than in his first meeting with Castillo (46-6-1,
42), running circles around his slower, more methodical opponent.</TE>
<TE>   The judges didn't seem impressed, scoring it as a close fight.
Daniel Van De Weile and Ken Morita both scored it 115-113, while
fellow judge Larry O'Connell had it 116-113.</TE>
<TE>   The Times scored it 117-111 for Mayweather.</TE>
<TE>   As the fight wore on, Castillo, his nose bloodied from the fourth
round on, labored to merely lay a glove on Mayweather. A punch seemed
out of the question -- though he did hold his opponent repeatedly,
even after referee Joe Cortez warned him.</TE>
<TE>   "I told you it would be easier this time," Mayweather said.</TE>
<TE>   "I never figured him out," conceded Castillo. "I couldn't find him
enough."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Mayweather brushed off his problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy with life, man," he said. "I don't have any problems."</TE>
<TE>   Before Saturday, Klitschko and McCline were being sold as the
future of the heavyweight division. What they showed, however, was
that they are not even as good as past-their-prime fighters such as
Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   Klitschko (40-1, 37) lacked movement, aggressiveness and any
concept of defense. McCline (28-3-3, 16) blew his 15 minutes of fame
by coming out tight and looking intimidated throughout the bout.</TE>
<TE>   "He was tough, but simple," Klitschko said, diplomatically.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, at the end of the 10th round, Klitschko put together a
flurry of five punches that knocked McCline down in his own corner.
McCline struggled to his feet just before the bell rung to end the
round.</TE>
<TE>   Before the 11th round could start, McCline's trainer, Jimmy Glenn,
told referee Jay Nady, "He's taken enough.... It's over."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Klitschko conceded, "Maybe it was a little bit boring."</TE>
<TE>   More than a little.</TE>

<HD>California Fails Its First Test</HD>
<DH>The Bears go into their matchup against Georgia undefeated
and head out with their first loss of the season in a 78-73 defeat in
overtime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California was still waiting for its first real test of the
basketball season.</LD>
<LD>   Georgia has been tested time and time again, already losing one
game and winning another on buzzer-beating shots.</LD>
<LD>   Their game Saturday went to the wire and beyond, as Georgia took a
78-73 overtime victory in the Wooden Classic at the Arrowhead Pond of
Anaheim.</LD>
<TE>   "It's something we look forward to," Georgia guard Ezra Williams
said.</TE>
<TE>   Cal hadn't lost after three games, but the competition had been
modest.</TE>
<TE>   Down the stretch and in overtime against Georgia (3-3), the Bears
turned skittish and forced shots, and Jim Harrick's Bulldogs
tightened their defense and handed Cal its first loss.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we had our opportunities," Cal Coach Ben Braun said.
"That's kind of hard to swallow."</TE>
<TE>   Cal led by one in the final two minutes of regulation, but Joe
Shipp shot an airball on a three-pointer as the shot clock ran down
on one possession, and Amit Tamir missed the front end of a
one-and-one with 1:01 left.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia's Jarvis Hayes, who scored 18 points and did much of the
defensive work in holding Shipp to 12 points after consecutive
30-point games, made a jumper as the shot clock ran down with 27
seconds left for a one-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   Then Cal's Brian Wethers, fouled by Williams with 14 seconds left,
made the front end of a one-and-one to tie the score, 69-69.</TE>
<TE>   But after Wethers missed the second shot, Cal got the rebound but
turned the ball over, and Georgia missed a shot at the regulation
buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   Overtime belonged to Georgia, with Williams hitting a big
three-pointer and Cal's Tamir missing from three-point range with the
Bears trailing by three on their confused final possession.</TE>
<TE>   "I was disappointed we couldn't pull it out," said Tamir, who led
all scorers with 27 points and 11 rebounds and made five of nine
three-pointers but didn't score in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't move the ball around and didn't try to break them down
by moving the ball from side to side."</TE>
<TE>   Wethers, who added 15, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we lost a little bit of patience down the stretch, and
that hurt us," Wethers said.</TE>
<TE>   Williams led Georgia with 23 points and made five of nine
three-pointers, but Harrick praised his team's defense.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the last 10 minutes -- the last five minutes of the
game and five minutes of overtime -- I thought we really guarded
them," he said. "Especially at the end, I really felt our warrior was
Chris Daniels. Even though Tamir got 27 points and 11 rebounds, down
the stretch, I thought we guarded him really, really well, especially
in overtime."</TE>
<TE>   Both these teams reached the second round of the NCAA tournament
last season, and both are trying to find themselves this season.</TE>
<TE>   Cal lost starters Jamal Sampson and Shantay Legans from last
season's team, and Georgia is waiting for the return of its only
center Steve Thomas, who was academically ineligible for the first
semester.</TE>
<TE>   Cal had beaten New Mexico, Cleveland State and Howard, and didn't
know a lot more about its team than when it started the season.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia, ranked 16th in the nation in the preseason poll, opened
with a close loss to now No. 2 Texas and beat Belmont before losing
to rival Georgia Tech.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the Bulldogs' wild trio of games: They lost to Minnesota
on a buzzer-beater Nov. 30 and fell out of the top 25 before beating
Colorado on a buzzer-beater Tuesday. Now add the overtime victory
over Cal.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get to March and you've got a win over a Big 12 team on
the road and a Pac-10 team on a neutral court, that helps you,"
Harrick said.</TE>
<TE>   "To win on the road will show up in March, and for your team's
psyche and team's confidence it's huge."</TE>

<LD>Los Alamitos High receiver Bradley Mandas caught two touchdown passes
to lead the second-seeded Griffins past Loyola, 31-7, Saturday night
in a Southern Section Division I semifinal at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   Los Alamitos (12-0-1) will make its first appearance in a Division
I championship game when it plays Santa Ana Mater Dei next Saturday
at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   Mandas' second touchdown reception of the game, on a 40-yard pass
from quarterback Jeff Kline midway through the third quarter, gave
the Griffins a commanding 21-7 lead.</LD>
<TE>   Mandas finished with three catches for 74 yards, including a
27-yard touchdown reception in the first quarter that helped put Los
Alamitos ahead, 7-0.</TE>
<TE>   C.J. Wellinger scored the only touchdown for Loyola (9-4) when he
hauled in a 10-yard pass from Scott Deke with 39 seconds left in the
first half.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Estes scored on a four-yard touchdown and gained all 63 of
his rushing yards in the second half for Los Alamitos, which had
never reached a Division I title game until now despite five
semifinal appearances.</TE>

<LD>It wasn't quite as easy this time, but Los Angeles Marymount was able
to defeat Atherton Menlo in the state Division IV girls' volleyball
championship for the third consecutive year.</LD>
<LD>   Led by the 15 kills and 34 assists of Stesha Selsky, named the
state tournament's most valuable player in Division IV, Marymount
came away with a 10-15, 15-4, 15-3, 15-10 victory Saturday at Cypress
College.</LD>
<LD>   "They were much better than they were a year ago because all of
their players were back," Selsky said of the Knights (24-7), who were
swept by Marymount each of the two previous years. "We thought we'd
come out and win it easily but you have to give them credit. That
first game woke us up."</LD>
<TE>   All-tournament selections Virginia Levanas and Jenna Dykstra
sparked a 12-3 run to open the fourth game for Marymount (36-4).</TE>
<TE>   Levanas finished with 10 kills and 10 blocks while Dykstra added
10 kills and 42 assists. Liz Cvitan had 10 kills and seven blocks and
Sandy Barbut had six kills and four aces for the Sailors.</TE>
<TE>   Marymount improved to 139-17 in Coach Cari Klein's five seasons.</TE>

<LD>Michael Okwo didn't score a touchdown Saturday night, but he didn't
much care.</LD>
<LD>   Okwo, who did just about everything but score, is going back to
the Southern Section Division III championship game.</LD>
<LD>   The senior tailback rushed for 271 yards in 35 carries as
Manhattan Beach Mira Costa rolled past Lancaster Antelope Valley,
31-12, in a semifinal at Mira Costa.</LD>
<TE>   The Mustangs (13-0) will play Sherman Oaks Notre Dame next week in
a battle of unbeaten teams at Mira Costa.</TE>
<TE>   "This means a lot to this group of guys," said Okwo, who was part
of Mustang teams that lost to Newhall Hart two years ago in the final
and again in a semifinal last year.</TE>
<TE>   Antelope Valley quarterback Johnny Walker raced 78 yards for a
touchdown on the second play from scrimmage, but had to come out of
the game after a crushing hit on the next series.</TE>
<TE>   Walker returned a little later but wasn't the same. He finished
with 140 yards in 16 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Antelope Valley pulled to within 24-12 when Sean Wallace bulled
through from one yard with 11 minutes 3 seconds left in the game. But
Mira Costa then went 69 yards in 11 plays, chewed up five minutes and
17 seconds, and took a 31-12 lead on a one-yard sneak by quarterback
Peter Dobush.</TE>
<TE>   Dobush completed six of 10 passes for 70 yards and two touchdowns
-- both to Nick Haley.</TE>

<HD>Mater Dei Adds Poly Upset to Rollinson's Collection</HD>
<DH>Monarchs rally from 13-point deficit to knock off defending
champion and top-seeded Jackrabbits, 21-20, in semifinal</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Step into Bruce Rollinson's office and you'll find that there's
barely room for so much as a football.</LD>
<LD>   Desks and bookcases are crammed with what seems like every
conceivable award, trophy and certificate achieved over 14 years as
Santa Ana Mater Dei High's coach.</LD>
<LD>   Rollinson better clear some space to document the Monarchs'
stirring 21-20 upset of top-seeded Long Beach Poly in the Southern
Section Division I semifinal on Saturday before an estimated 9,500 at
Edison Field. This victory was as special as any of the nine league
championships, five section titles and two national championships
that Rollinson has attained.</LD>
<TE>   Unseeded Mater Dei overcame pronounced disadvantages in size and
speed--not to mention a 20-7 third-quarter deficit--to stun a
Jackrabbit team that had been to the title game every year since
1996.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore quarterback Jason Forcier, who had completed one of
eight passes for minus-six yards, connected with Corey Boudreaux on
an 80-yard touchdown play nearly four minutes into the fourth quarter
to tie the score at 20.</TE>
<TE>   Kicker Jerry Corona, whose missed extra point three weeks ago cost
the Monarchs a shot at the Serra League title, converted the
point-after try that sent Mater Dei (10-3) to its first championship
game since 1999. The Monarchs will play Los Alamitos, a 31-7 winner
over Los Angeles Loyola, in the title game next Saturday at Edison
Field.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the toughest-hearted teams I've ever had,"
Rollinson said. "It comes down to the sophomore quarterback not
throwing it well and then hitting the big pass. After that, we would
not be denied."</TE>
<TE>   Boudreaux was another Mater Dei hero, hauling in two of the
Monarchs' three interceptions in addition to the winning catch.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone thought we were going to lose," said Boudreaux, who has
seven interceptions this season. "We proved everyone wrong. Now we're
going to the big show."</TE>
<TE>   While Mater Dei fans celebrated their victory, Poly players were
in disbelief. The Jackrabbits (11-2) had led, 20-7, less than a
minute into the third quarter after quarterback Leon Jackson hooked
up with Derrick Jones for a 73-yard touchdown on a flanker screen.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, though, Poly Coach Raul Lara was concerned. "My main
concern was that we couldn't let their guys milk the clock and
score," Lara said, "and they did that."</TE>
<TE>   After Mater Dei running back Rafael Rice (120 yards, two
touchdowns) scored on a five-yard run to make it 20-14 midway through
the third quarter, Poly had a chance to pad its lead when Nate Smith
lined up for a 40-yard field goal. But Smith, whose first-quarter
point-after kick was blocked by Ross Poole, had his kick come up just
short.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Horgan is a guitar-playing, classic-rock-loving senior who's
so smart he could probably earn an academic scholarship to an Ivy
League school.</LD>
<LD>   He's also a 6-foot-5, 235-pound tight end and defensive end for
Los Angeles Loyola High with 11 sacks, which means he's going to
accept a football scholarship to Stanford.</LD>
<LD>   He only started playing football as a sophomore after giving up
ice hockey, a sport in which he got into at least 10 fights, which is
a bit surprising because he's so quiet his coaches almost jump in
astonishment whenever he talks.</LD>
<TE>   "I prefer to listen rather than speak," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Horgan is known as the quiet guy who turns into The Incredible
Hulk.</TE>
<TE>   He has a 4.2 grade-point average, scored 1,480 on the SAT and
possesses such a sophisticated outlook that he could teach a college
class on philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   "You learn a lot about yourself from throwing yourself into an
uncomfortable situation, getting up in front of an audience and being
honest and not trying to hide," he said. "I've learned to care less
what other people think of me and care more what I think of myself."</TE>
<TE>   He's an introvert but doesn't feel distanced. He's a
contradiction, someone who enjoys lurking anonymously in the
background but doesn't mind performing in front of thousands of
football spectators. He's even considering playing his guitar in
front of an audience.</TE>
<TE>   "I might have to come out of my shell a little bit," he said,
mockingly.</TE>
<TE>   Only a couple weeks ago, Loyola was hovering near the bottom of
the Serra League, seemingly going nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   "The buzzards were flying over us," Coach Steve Grady said.</TE>
<TE>   Rising from the dead is what the Cubs accomplished this season. A
31-7 loss to Los Alamitos Saturday night in a Division I semifinal
game at Edison Field doesn't detract from a season that revealed
plenty about the team's character.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs upset Anaheim Servite in their regular-season finale to
finish fourth in the Serra League, gained an at-large playoff berth,
defeated Lakewood, then beat Serra champion Bellflower St. John
Bosco.</TE>
<TE>   Horgan has been the best football player during Loyola's
roller-coaster season.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in the trenches on offense and defense," Grady said. "He's
got a lot of bumps and bruises but never says anything."</TE>
<TE>   While music allows him to be creative and spontaneous, football
offers Horgan a thrill he finds hard to duplicate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something that happens in the middle of a play," he said.
"You're tired and don't feel you want to keep going, but you force
yourself and are successful. That feeling is indescribable and
priceless."</TE>
<TE>   Horgan one day could be writing musical scores for movies or
catching touchdown passes as a tight end in the NFL. He could be
playing his guitar at a coffee shop or teaching music at a
university.</TE>
<TE>   You never know what the future has in store for an 18-year-old
whose mind is as alive as his heart.</TE>

<LD>It was a bad night for quarterbacks in the Southern Section Division
XI semifinal, but a good night passing for at least one halfback.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Drayton, who sprained his ankle with more than 10 minutes
left in the third quarter, returned for only one play and delivered a
44-yard fourth-quarter touchdown pass to Caleb Flores to help propel
top-seeded Hacienda Heights Los Altos to a 29-28 victory over
fourth-seeded Tustin, 29-28, Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Suarez kicked the extra point for Los Altos with 8:23 left,
giving the host team a 29-22 lead.</LD>
<TE>   Then, it was time for Tustin (7-6) to put the ball into the
passing arm of its running back. After marching 95 yards, with
Marquis Malcolm scoring from six yards with 1:33 left, the Tillers
went for a two-point conversion and the victory.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of running behind tackle Sam Baker and tight end Chris
Barrett, as they had all night -- Malcolm rushed 33 times for 201
yards and three touchdowns -- the Tillers turned to Malcolm to pass.
Brigham Harwell jumped in front of Malcolm, forcing him to pull the
ball back, and when Malcolm finally tried to connect with Barrett in
the end zone, Flores stepped up for an interception.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe if he runs the ball, their crowd is going crazy," said
Los Altos Coach Greg Gano, whose team came back from a 14-0 deficit
behind Randall Brown, who rushed for 17 times for 137 yards and
touchdowns of four, one and 48 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Said Tustin Coach Myron Miller of the two-point attempt: "It was
going to be completely wide open, They had 11 guys on the line.... I
didn't want to go to overtime."</TE>
<TE>   The victory sends Los Altos to the championship game for the
fourth consecutive year. Its three previous appearances were in
Division VII. The Conquerors (11-2) will play third-seeded Santa Ana
Foothill (11-2) on Friday at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   -- Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   Ventura St. Bonaventure 46, Moorpark 40 -- Senior wide receiver
Nick Pierson scored the go-ahead touchdown with 9:31 to play and
intercepted a pass with 1:43 left as St. Bonaventure came from behind
to win a Division IV semifinal at Moorpark.</TE>
<TE>   St. Bonaventure (12-1) scored four touchdowns in the last 18
minutes 29 seconds to erase a 27-17 halftime deficit and advance to
its fourth consecutive championship game on Friday against Weslake
Village Westlake (10-2). The Seraphs won the last three Division XI
titles in a row before moving up to Division IV this season.</TE>
<TE>   Pierson, who finished with six catches for 170 yards, including
scoring receptions of 50 and 59 yards, helped secure the victory with
the 59-yard touchdown with 9:31 left.</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Cardwell rushed for 231 yards and scored three first-half
touchdowns for Moorpark (11-2).</TE>
<TE>   -- Lauren Peterson</TE>
<TE>   West Covina South Hills 17, Santa Fe Springs Sante Fe 10 -- Jeremy
Payton caught a 23-yard touchdown pass from Philip Guerrero midway
through the fourth quarter and later intercepted Danny Banzet's
desperation pass on the six-yard line with 40 seconds left for the
fourth-seeded Huskies (10-3) at Sante Fe.</TE>
<TE>   Stephano Smith scored on a two-yard run and Art Reyes kicked a
37-yard field goal with 1:41 left in the first half to give South
Hills a 10-3 halftime lead. The Huskies will play second-seeded
Walnut in the Division VII final on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Ricky Sanchez had three sacks for Santa Fe (10-3), which was
outgained 281 to 155 yards.</TE>
<TE>   -- Mayar Zokaei</TE>
<TE>   Fontana Kaiser 21, Victorville Victor Valley 7 -- Alan Wade had
189 yards and two touchdowns in 24 carries for top-seeded Kaiser
(12-0-1), which plays second-seeded Phelan Serrano (12-0) for the
Division VIII title on Saturday. Victor Valley ends its season 6-7.</TE>
<TE>   La Habra 20, Fountain Valley Los Amigos 7 -- Daniel Morales
completed nine of 10 passes for 130 yards and one touchdown for the
top-seeded Highlanders (12-1), who converted three Los Amigos fumbles
into scores to build a 20-0 halftime lead at Garden Grove High.</TE>
<TE>   Jake Hammond caught three passes for 49 yards, including one for a
30-yard touchdown for La Habra, which will play Garden Grove Pacifica
(10-2) in the Division IX championship game at 7 p.m. Friday at Cal
State Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Findling rushed for 44 yards in 13 carries and scored on runs
of 15 and two yards for La Habra. Anthony Matagi rushed for 115 yards

<LD>Mission Viejo's defense gave the rest of the team a nudge it needed
Saturday night in a Southern Section Division II semifinal against
Claremont. The Diablos produced a goal-line stand in the first
quarter, inspiring the offense to come alive in a 26-7 victory at
Mission Viejo.</LD>
<LD>   The Wolfpack had first and goal inside the Mission Viejo one
midway through the opening quarter, but the Diablos knocked Claremont
backward on the next two plays, then Marques Daily intercepted a pass
in the end zone.</LD>
<LD>   That's as close as Claremont came to scoring the rest of the half,
and Mission Viejo scored three touchdowns in eight minutes of the
second quarter.</LD>
<TE>   "The offense took our energy from the goal-line stop and
transformed it," defensive lineman Justin Williams said. "Today was a
nice show."</TE>
<TE>   The top-seeded Diablos (13-0) will play second-seeded Newhall Hart
in the championship game Saturday at 2 p.m. at Edison Field. Mission
Viejo will be trying for its second consecutive undefeated season.</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo played without quarterback Josh Rodarmel, who
re-injured his shoulder in the first playoff game. But the Diablos
have found a worthy replacement in Marty Tadman, normally a wide
receiver.</TE>
<TE>   Tadman threw two touchdown passes in the second quarter, then was
content handing off to running backs Ryan Holmes and Jamielle Gummer
in the second half, throwing just one pass.</TE>
<TE>   Tadman gave the Diablos a 7-0 lead with 8 minutes 22 seconds
remaining in the first half, throwing a 48-yard touchdown pass to
Clark Hardman.</TE>
<TE>   Claremont (9-4) tried a trick play on its next possession, but a
deep pass by running back Jamal Floyd was picked off by Trevor
Miller, one of three interceptions by the Diablos.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Dunn's 30-yard reception put the ball at the Claremont five
and Holmes ran it in from the one two plays later. The Diablos got
the ball back with 2:50 remaining in the first half and didn't let
up, scoring on a 35-yard pass from Tadman to Taylor Holiday with 27
seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo moved ahead, 26-0, on a 14-play, 97-yard drive that
was capped by Holmes' three-yard run with 8:23 remaining in the game.</TE>

<HD>L.B. Wilson Falls to St. Francis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mountain View St. Francis High had been here before, year after year,
snaring the trophies and securing the tradition that comes with
winning six state Division II girls' volleyball championships in the
last nine years before moving up, mercifully, to Division I this
season.</LD>
<LD>   As for Long Beach Wilson? Simply happy to be part of Saturday's
Division I title match at Cypress College.</LD>
<LD>   Wilson had never been this far, and perhaps it showed at the worst
times, with the Bruins dropping two tight games in a 16-14, 15-9,
15-13 loss to St. Francis.</LD>
<TE>   Wilson failed to hold a 14-13 lead in the first game and couldn't
overcome a 14-13 deficit in the third game against the No. 1-ranked
team in the nation by Student Sports magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "Give us a little more time and a little more patience and we'll
be there too," Wilson Coach Susan Pescar said. "All we need is a
little more time."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, ranked No. 8 in the nation, received 16 kills from junior
Brett Quirarte and 15 kills from sophomore Cynthia Barboza.</TE>
<TE>   But St. Francis (31-1) had 22 kills from junior Jessica Gysin and
19 kills from junior Diane Copenhagen. More important, the Lancers
knew how to clamp down as the first and third games wound down.</TE>
<TE>   "Did our experience help? All the things our people have been
through? Yes," said St. Francis Coach Kim Oden, who played for the
U.S. women's team in the 1988 and 1992 Olympics. "This is a special
group."</TE>
<TE>   St. Francis had already defeated the Bruins in four games in the
championship match of the Torrey Pines tournament Nov. 2. Wilson had
hoped for a different outcome this time. It didn't happen.</TE>
<TE>   St. Francis was relentless on its attack and almost flawless on
defense, particularly when it mattered most.</TE>
<TE>   Said Pescar: "They had very few errors today."</TE>
<TE>   Torrance Bishop Montgomery d. San Jose Presentation, 13-15, 15-5,
18-16, 15-8 -- Nicole Read had 17 kills, Noelle Quinn had 15 and the
Knights won their third Division III championship since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   It was the third game that pushed the Knights over the top. Bishop
Montgomery managed to lose a 9-0 lead and fell behind by scores of
14-12 and 16-15, but rallied to win the game on a soft kill to the
middle by Read.</TE>
<TE>   "That kind of made us feel, 'We've got it,' " Bishop Montgomery
Coach Kim Willeman said.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn, who will go to UCLA on a basketball scholarship, had six
blocks for the Knights (29-8). Read and freshman Ashley Ferrell each
had four blocks.</TE>
<TE>   Paris Rouissinia had 14 kills for Presentation (29-8).</TE>
<TE>   Bakersfield Liberty d. Los Gatos, 15-10, 15-8, 17-15--The Patriots
(32-4), in only their third year of varsity volleyball, won the
Division II championship.</TE>
<TE>   Jania Motton led the way for Liberty with 26 kills.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco University d. Solana Beach Santa Fe Christian, 15-9,
15-5, 11-15, 15-6--Natalie Engmann had 18 kills and the Devils (31-6)
won their first Division V championship.</TE>

<HD>Etiwanda's Poe Wins West Region Boys' Title</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Senior Michael Poe of Etiwanda is usually not real demonstrative when
it comes to winning, but his emotions got the best of him Saturday at
the end of the seeded boys' race in the West region cross-country
championships at Mt. San Antonio College.</LD>
<LD>   With a few strides left in the 5,000-meter race, and a win firmly
in place, Poe raised both his arms skyward and flashed the victory
sign.</LD>
<LD>   Poe pumped his arms until he crossed the finish line on the Mt.
SAC track in 15 minutes 34 seconds, four seconds ahead of runner-up
Steve Sheperd of Weber High in North Ogden, Utah.</LD>
<TE>   The top eight finishers in the seeded boys' and girls' races
qualified for the national championships at Morley Field in San Diego
next Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe I won because I don't think I was really expected
to even finish in the top eight," said Poe, the Southern Section and
state Division I champion. "But I just went in with the attitude that
I could beat anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Junior Mohamed Trafeh of Duarte was the only other runner from the
Southland to advance to the national championships, finishing eighth
in 15:49.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Alison Costello of Anaheim Esperanza finished 17th in 18:57
in the girls' race for the highest finish by a runner from the
Southland.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Liza Pasciuto of Murrieta Valley placed 21st in 19:00 after
coming through the mile in fifth place.</TE>

<LD>Debonair Joe, who couldn't beat $12,500 claimers at Fairplex Park

<HD>Parra's Story Is Inspiring to Others</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When he began his post-Olympic whirlwind of fundraisers and talk
shows, speedskater Derek Parra expected he'd smile a lot and talk
about his improbable beginnings as an in-line roller skater in San
Bernardino and his tenacious climb to the medal stand in Salt Lake
City.</LD>
<LD>   But instead of describing his 5,000-meter race, in which he
surprisingly won a silver medal, or reminiscing about winning the
1,500 in a world-record time of 1 minute, 43.95 seconds, Parra found
himself listening to his audience's stories.</LD>
<LD>   Time and again, everywhere he went, people told him they drew
inspiration from knowing a stocky, 5-4, 140-pound Latino who grew up
poor could become an Olympic champion in a winter sport he took up
merely six years ago. They told him he hadn't been alone out there,
because their cheers had pushed him to the finish line.</LD>
<TE>   "I never thought it was anybody's dream but mine," he said. "But
total strangers, people I'll never meet again, would tell me how I
had changed their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "Grandparents said they were sitting with their children and
grandchildren and they saw me win, and now they believe in their
dreams. Maybe their child didn't think they could do something, but
now they do. Maybe they were Hispanic or grew up in a part of the
country where speedskating wasn't a traditional sport. It really
threw me off. I didn't realize how many people were affected by what
I did."</TE>
<TE>   Parra has handled his success, including a modeling appearance in
Gap jeans ads, with refreshing grace. He speaks on behalf of the
National Hispanic Press Foundation, which encourages education among
Latinos, and established two scholarships for Latino students. He
also returned to competition and finished the fall World Cup races
ranked first in the 1,500.</TE>
<TE>   Parra, 32, returned from Europe last week for a reunion with his
wife, Tiffany, and their daughter, Mia, who will be a year old next
week. They'll soon leave their Florida home for an apartment near
Salt Lake City so he can train for the U.S. championships later this
month.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to ask [Tiffany] if I should continue, and she
didn't want to ask me to stop," he said. "She said, 'Let's give it a
shot if you can be there for me and help me raise Mia.' She's given
up so much for me."</TE>
<TE>   Competing at the 2006 Games "is in the back of my mind," Parra
said, but he's not sure. "My goal is to try to become the overall
world champion, which is four distances," he said. "No one's done
that. No one's been a roller skating world champion and speedskating
world champion.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not special. I'm not a big, huge monster of a man. I couldn't
reach the Olympics in roller skating and switched to speedskating and
all these wonderful things have happened. It's like a dream I'm still
living."</TE>
<TE>   Shuttle Diplomacy</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim is a finalist to host the 2005 world championships of
badminton, which have never taken place in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   David Simon, head of the Los Angeles Sports Council, said
international badminton officials told him the council's bid to hold
the event at the Pond in late May or early June 2005 had been
favorably received, but they told him little else.</TE>
<TE>   "They sent a cryptic e-mail saying, 'You're on the short list but
we can't tell you who else is on it,' " he said. "The next
championships are in Birmingham, England, in May of 2003 and there
will be meetings in February to decide the 2005 event, so we'll be in
discussions with them."</TE>
<TE>   Simon believes the event would have wide appeal in Southern
California. "The attraction of having it here is because it's so
popular in Asia and we have all kinds of Asian communities here," he
said. "And if we can get the word out, we think it would do well."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, whose group helped secure the 2003 World Gymnastics
Championships at the Pond, attended this year's gymnastics
championships in Hungary to observe. "Hats off to the Hungarians for
pulling it off on short notice," he said. "There were no complaints
at all.... After seeing what they did, I feel good about where we
are."</TE>
<TE>   ESPN will televise the gymnastics championships Dec. 29 and Jan 2.</TE>
<TE>   It's in the Blood, Eh?</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. junior national hockey team will have some familiar names
when it competes at the world junior championships later this month
in Halifax and Sydney, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The roster includes Patrick Eaves, son of NHL alum Mike Eaves;
Eric Nystrom, son of former New York Islander standout Bobby Nystrom;
Zach Parise, son of long-time NHL forward J.P. Parise; and Ryan
Suter, son of 1980 U.S. Olympian Bob Suter and nephew of recently
retired defenseman Gary Suter. At 17, Ryan Suter is the youngest on
the team and is considered immensely promising.</TE>

the games.</TE>

<HD>Georgia Makes Its Point Quickly</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>David Wharton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>The roar began shortly before kickoff, a caterwaul from Georgia fans
who had waited two decades to see their football team win another
Southeastern Conference championship.</LD>
<LD>   The Bulldogs weren't about to let them wait a minute longer. Or
catch their breath.</LD>
<LD>   A blocked punt. A nifty run. A string of field goals. The
fourth-ranked Bulldogs scored on their first five possessions and
never looked back, burying Arkansas, 30-3, before a crowd of 74,835
at the Georgia Dome on Saturday night.</LD>
<TE>   "It seemed like a home game for us," Georgia kicker Billy Bennett
said. "I kind of felt bad for Arkansas because the crowd was almost
all in red and black."</TE>
<TE>   The victory ended 20 years of frustration for a program that once
knew greatness. It did not matter that the players learned before
kickoff that Miami had defeated Virginia Tech, thereby ending any
outside chance they had to sneak into the Fiesta Bowl national
championship game.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years and that roar was all the incentive they needed. Even
Coach Mark Richt, who arrived from Florida State only two years ago,
mused: "It's been a long time and a lot of disappointment."</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas, meanwhile, was hoping to put a fairy tale ending on a
regular season that saw the Razorbacks win six games in a row to
reach the conference championship. The payoff was a little less than
they had expected.</TE>
<TE>   "You play all year to get into games like this," linebacker Tony
Bua said. "It just makes me sick to my stomach to come out flat and
not get anything going."</TE>
<TE>   Things turned sour for Arkansas (9-4) on the sixth play of the
game when Georgia's Decory Bryant sneaked in from the right end and
blocked a punt. Bulldog running back Musa Smith scored from two yards
out. Three minutes later he was back in the end zone, finishing a
long drive with a 17-yard touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett supplied the rest of the early scoring, making three field
goals to give his team a 23-0 lead at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   "This game just did not start out right for us," Arkansas Coach
Houston Nutt said.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't end so well either. The Razorbacks managed only 139
yards in total offense as quarterback Matt Jones was sacked four
times and generally harrassed all evening.</TE>
<TE>   Smith carried most of the load for Georgia (12-1), running 19
times for 106 yards. Quarterback David Greene had 237 yards passing
and a 20-yard touchdown pass to Benjamin Watson in the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs now have a date in the Sugar Bowl -- and a possible
reunion for Richt and Florida State -- but the players and their
fans, who were still screaming on their way out of the stadium,
wanted time to savor this victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't get any better than this," Smith said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Let the cheers ring out. Sepp Blatter is not corrupt after all.</LD>
<LD>   Let's hear it for the Swiss prosecutors who determined on Thursday
that the president of world soccer's governing body, who is a Swiss
citizen, did not cook the FIFA books or hide the facts.</LD>
<LD>   Hooray for Sepp.</LD>
<TE>   But before cheering too loudly, this might be a good time to point
out to the president of FIFA that although his own financial
maneuverings have been found to be aboveboard, soccer worldwide is
sinking in a sea of red ink.</TE>
<TE>   Bankruptcies, unpaid wages, defaults on loans, unmet bills,
strikes, salary caps -- all these make for a sorry tale as 2002 draws
to a close.</TE>
<TE>   Unless something is done about it soon, the international soccer
landscape is going to look a lot different before much longer. It
will be littered with the corpses of once-proud teams.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that Real Madrid could afford to buy Ronaldo for $46
million and change this year, or that the European Champions League
raked in more fans and money than ever before.</TE>
<TE>   The plain fact is that from Colo Colo to Kaiserslautern and from
Lazio to Leicester City, famous and not-so-famous teams, some with a
century or more of tradition behind them, are on the economic ropes.</TE>
<TE>   Costs have skyrocketed and income, especially from television, has
dropped off a cliff.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the financial woes facing many teams are becoming as
much of a story worldwide as the games they play. And that's too bad.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before Blatter was absolved in a case brought by some of
his fellow movers and shakers in Zurich, Adriano Galliani, president
of the Italian soccer federation, warned that some Italian clubs
might go out of business in the next three years unless they find a
way to control spending.</TE>
<TE>   A report in the Avvenire newspaper showed that the league's 18
Serie A clubs spend $751 million a year on player salaries, an amount
equal to 88% of their annual turnover.</TE>
<TE>   Inter Milan, with a salary budget of $118 million, AC Milan, with
$107 million, and Juventus, with $103 million, were the biggest
spenders. Of the 18 clubs, only Juventus made a profit last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Many clubs risk not surviving the next three years," Galliani
told Avvenire. "Club directors are partly to blame, but the moment
has come for the players to understand and come to new agreements,
otherwise many of them risk seeing their contracts only on paper."</TE>
<TE>   And no sooner had that gloomy news been digested than there was
more of the same from England, where Manchester United's chief
executive, Peter Kenyon, suggested in a BBC radio interview that
perhaps it was time for England's 92 professional clubs to be halved.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite clearly, I don't think we can have four divisions of
professional football any longer," Kenyon said. "There are too many
clubs. That's not to say they can't all exist, but they can't all be
professional and that has to be reviewed."</TE>
<TE>   Kenyon did not suggest, of course, that the Reds, who are very
much in the black, be one of those clubs reduced to amateur status.</TE>
<TE>   More bad news came from Germany, where 102-year-old Kaiserslautern
is facing possible bankruptcy. It needs about $20 million to pay back
taxes, allegedly because of financial irregularities by former club
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this season, Kaiserslautern sold the rights to German
World Cup striker Miroslav Klose to a regional lottery company for $5
million simply because it needed the cash.</TE>
<TE>   If the situation is bad for the big clubs, it is far worse for the
small ones, and not all of them will have the good fortune that came
Barnsley's way last month.</TE>
<TE>   Barnsley, which traces its history to 1887, was on the brink of
closing its doors. But Peter Doyle, a retired businessman and the
town's mayor, stepped in at the last minute and bought the
second-division club.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an investment in the town that I love," Doyle said. But he
warned that it would take more than a new owner to save the club.</TE>
<TE>   "If you open a corner shop and there's nobody coming in, are you
going to keep it open?" he asked. "This is the real world. We need
fans to come through the gate to go forward. We can't do it on our
own. The days of people buying football clubs for a novelty are in
the past.</TE>
<TE>   "It's got to be an effort for the town. We've got the body
breathing again. I am going to put every hour that God sends into
making sure we get it right."</TE>
<TE>   Barnsley's troubles are, hopefully, over, but there are hundreds,
probably thousands, of clubs worldwide that are in financial
jeopardy, and not because they splash out $118 million a year on
player salaries, as does Inter Milan.</TE>
<TE>   Barnsley, for example, was about to fold because it couldn't meet
total debts of no more than $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   It is not FIFA's responsibility, naturally, to bail out clubs or
leagues economically. Even the gnomes in Zurich can't come up with
enough money to do that.</TE>
<TE>   But it is FIFA's duty to help the sport put its financial house
back in order by whatever means can be found. The game should not be
bled dry by the few. What wealth there is in soccer needs to be
distributed more equitably.</TE>
<TE>   There should be accountability before it becomes necessary to call
in the accountants.</TE>
<TE>   Accomplishing that requires leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Blatter no longer has to worry about being prosecuted,
perhaps he and his FIFA cohorts will find the time to exhibit some.</TE>

<LD>Bad news seems to follow Pepperdine wherever it goes these days. The
good news is that it isn't affecting the Waves' record.</LD>
<LD>   Two days after learning that point guard Devin Montgomery will be
out four to six weeks with a fractured right thumb, Pepperdine banded
together its injury-depleted lineup and defeated UC Santa Barbara,
72-68, Saturday night before 2,266 at Firestone Fieldhouse.</LD>
<LD>   The Waves (3-2) won their third in a row despite the news of
Montgomery's injury following an X-ray on Thursday. He was hurt in
Wednesday night's victory over Cal State Fullerton.</LD>
<TE>   Terrance Johnson had a game-high 21 points, Jimmy Miggins had 17
and Boomer Brazzle added 13.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm starting to wonder if we're [jinxed] too," Miggins said.
"Life goes on. We can't stop."</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery's injury adds to a list that includes forward Glen
McGowan and center Will Kimble. McGowan is still recovering from
off-season knee surgery and Kimble's career is likely over because of
a heart condition diagnosed last month.</TE>
<TE>   With only seven scholarship players on the active roster, the
Waves managed to slow a Santa Barbara squad coming off a big win
Tuesday against USC. Pepperdine had a rebounding advantage for the
first time this season and forced 23 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine Coach Paul Westphal changed his lineup to improve its
rebounding. Freshman 6-foot-8 forward David Patten, who was set to
redshirt, earned a start in his first collegiate game and 6-10 center
Derick Grubb and 6-7 forward Dustin Johnson also played significant
minutes. All three helped the Waves gain a 39-33 advantage on the
boards.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had to change our style, plus deal with the emotional loss
of Will," Westphal said. "Getting three wins this week was real
good."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Hull led Santa Barbara (3-3) with 18 points.</TE>
<TE>   -- Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Marymount 75, Cal State Fullerton 68 -- Youthful Loyola
Marymount showed composure when it counted and held on to win at
Gersten Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   Four players scored in double figures for the Lions (4-3), who
play four freshmen. Sophomore Andy Osborn led Loyola with 15 points,
sophomore Charles Brown chipped in 12 and five assists, junior Jason
Dickens scored 11 and junior Keith Kincade scored 10.</TE>
<TE>   Center Pape Sow, in foul trouble much of the game, led Fullerton
(1-4) with 19 points and 10 rebounds. His backup, Bron Groomes,
scored 15.</TE>
<TE>   With two minutes remaining, the Lions were clinging to a 67-65
lead, but four consecutive free throws by Brown gave Loyola Marymount
some breathing room and Fullerton never got closer than five points
after that.</TE>
<TE>   -- Paul McLeod</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Northridge 117, Bethany College 51 -- Northridge used a
full-court press to help force 40 turnovers en route to the
nonconference victory at Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   Leading, 9-7, Northridge (4-2) scored 12 straight points and then
10 more after a basket by Bethany (3-5) to pull to a comfortable 31-9
lead with 6:40 to play in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   The Matadors, who shot 50% from the field, were led by forward
Chris Davis who scored 19 points.</TE>
<TE>   -- Doug Ferber</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine 91, Pomona-Pitzer 23 -- Stanislav Zuzak scored a
season-high 12 points to lead host Irvine (3-2), which scored the
first 25 points and set school records for fewest points allowed and
largest margin of victory. The Sagehens (1-4), a Division III team,
missed their first 13 field-goal attempts and shot only 13% from the
field.</TE>

<TE>   Update--This is the first of three consecutive home games against
teams that even this struggling Bruin squad should beat. Point guard
Ryan Walcott returns after missing the losses to San Diego and Duke
because he played in an exhibition before his redshirt season in
2000. Although he is not a starter, Walcott is expected to play about
20 minutes and his quickness should enable UCLA to press early in the
game for the first time this season. Long Beach, which defeated Cal
State Monterey Bay and lost to UC Irvine and Pepperdine, has no
starter taller than 6 feet 8. Guard Tony Darden is a prolific scorer.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Villanueva looked up from tending his barbecue to notice a group
of USC fans milling in front of the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   "A bunch of bandwagon jumpers, if you ask me," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Villanueva, a lifelong Bruin fan from Arcadia, laughed at the
once-in-a-lifetime scenario: Trojan fans showing up in Pasadena to
root for UCLA.</LD>
<TE>   But it was no joke to USC freshman Jonathan Chambers, who knew a
Bruin victory over Washington State would put the Trojans in the Rose
Bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our job," Chambers said of cheering for UCLA. "We'd rather
come to the Rose Bowl [game] than go to Miami for the Orange Bowl.
This isn't any regular thing. We're not going to be rooting for UCLA
after this game."</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, the only fans who went home satisfied were those
from Washington State after the Cougars clinched a share of the
Pacific 10 Conference title and a berth in the Rose Bowl with a 48-27
victory.</TE>
<TE>   For a few hours, though, USC and UCLA fans stood shoulder to
shoulder cheering for the Bruins and clapping along with the UCLA
fight song. It wasn't until early in the fourth quarter, after Cougar
safety Erik Coleman returned an interception 25 yards for a touchdown
and a 21-point lead, that supporters of the two local schools filed
toward the exits, united in their disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, USC fan Casey said she never imagined a situation
where she'd be happy to root for UCLA. She declined to give her last
name because she works at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I've woken up in my own personal twilight zone," the
South Pasadena resident said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if she felt strange cheering for USC's cross-town rival,
Casey said, "No, not at all. Go, Bruins! Fight, fight, fight!"</TE>
<TE>   USC alumnus Steve McGhghy of Covina said he didn't have a problem
rooting for the Bruins because the Trojans routed them, 52-21, two
weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to be screaming for them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   McGhghy was hoping to make a third appearance at the Rose Bowl on
New Year's Day.</TE>
<TE>   "We kind of figure this is a home away from home for us," he said,
pointing out that USC is 20-8 in Rose Bowl games. "If the Bruins can
help us get here on Jan. 1, it's our preference."</TE>
<TE>   Though he's a UCLA fan, Villanueva found a silver lining in the
Bruins' loss. He hopes it leads to the firing of Coach Bob Toledo.</TE>
<TE>   "It's that much closer for Toledo to be ousted," he said. "I'm not
happy with him at all."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington State Coach Mike Price said he was "furious" after the
Cougars botched an onside kick that led to a UCLA touchdown with 41
seconds left in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   After Washington State took a 31-14 lead on an 80-yard touchdown
run by Jermaine Green, kicker Adam Holiday dribbled a kickoff that
went only five yards before he fell on it at the Cougar 39. On the
next play, Drew Olson completed a scoring pass to wide receiver
Junior Taylor to pull UCLA within 31-21.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just an unbelievable error," Price said. "It was a
terrible miscommunication between myself and the kicker."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior Mike Seidman set the UCLA record for receiving yardage in a
season by a tight end. Seidman, who caught four passes for 68 yards,
has 41 receptions for 631 yards, surpassing the previous record of
577 yards set by Paul Bergmann in 1982. Bergmann holds the reception
record with 44 in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wide receiver Jon Dubravac completed a 55-yard scoring pass to
running back Manuel White in the first quarter to give UCLA its only
lead, 14-7. It was the third touchdown pass of the season for
Dubravac, who also had scoring throws against Colorado and Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Three Bruins suffered serious injuries Saturday. Linebacker
Spencer Havner, named the Pac-10 freshman of the year by the Sporting
News, broke his right hand. Running back Jason Harrison injured his
right knee. Safety Jarrad Page was forced to the bench because of a
back injury.</TE>

<HD>Connecticut Women May Have to Share State Spotlight</HD>
<DH>But advent of Division I-A football also might give
Huskies' highly successful program a financial boost.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Terry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>HARTFORD, Conn.</DL>
<LD>USC, an NCAA championship program in the 1980s, will play
Connecticut, the current national champion, for the first time today.</LD>
<LD>   And when the Trojans come out on the floor they will see something
they hardly ever see in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   An arena filled to capacity with fans. Hard-core women's
basketball fans, whose passion for the game and the Huskies can be
seen and felt all over the state and not just in Storrs, Conn., where
the university is. From cabdrivers to council members, there is a
familiar refrain: "I wasn't that big a basketball fan until I
starting watching them play."</LD>
<TE>   There has been so much to watch. Since the program's inception in
1974, the Huskies have tied for or won 12 Big East championships,
appeared in six Final Fours, had two undefeated seasons and won three
national championships. (The men's team has one national
championship.) Last year's title team -- 39-0, winning by an average
of 35.4 points and never trailing at halftime -- may have been the
best women's college team in history.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee is probably the only major college program whose
following can compare to Connecticut's. But even the Tennessee women,
who have won six national championships and can easily fill their
24,000-seat Thompson-Boling Arena on campus, take a backseat to
football.</TE>
<TE>   Will the same thing happen to Husky basketball? Because football,
Division I-A football, has arrived at Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   Until a couple of years ago the Huskies were a Division I-AA
program. But through the work of campus officials and the support of
the state legislature, Connecticut is making a smooth transition.</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies have played an independent schedule but will join the
Big East in 2005. This season they were able to provide the 85
football scholarships allowed by the NCAA. And next season they move
into a $91-million, 44,000-seat stadium now under construction. By
the time it's finished it will be a $110-million complex. And
Connecticut will spend an additional $44 million over the next three
years to upgrade its facilities, of which $32 million is from
taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   Athletic Director Lew Perkins has worked the last nine years to
bring Connecticut athletics to the point where all 24 men's and
women's teams are Division I-A.</TE>
<TE>   Perkins believes a big-time football program, if successful, will
attract more outstanding athletes to the university.</TE>
<TE>   "We recruit well in basketball," Perkins said. "But we had a hard
time recruiting against other schools with big football games. If you
look at the top 20 schools, nearly all are Division I-A schools."</TE>
<TE>   Football Coach Randy Edsall, who guided the Huskies to a 6-6
record that included an upset of Iowa State, knew it was important to
get the support of women's Coach Geno Auriemma and men's Coach Jim
Calhoun.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing we had to rely on was the name recognition we achieved
through basketball to help us get in the door," Edsall said. "From
what we did this year, football can now rest on its own merits. It
says we have a well-rounded athletic department, that Connecticut
does things right."</TE>
<TE>   It will take time to see whether Connecticut women's basketball
loses its statewide spotlight to football. But USC's Chris Gobrecht,
who has also coached Washington and Florida State and knows the kind
of shadow a premier football program can cast, doesn't think the
Connecticut basketball program will suffer.</TE>
<TE>   "I have found that women's basketball and football can be very
compatible if you have a highly successful football program,"
Gobrecht said. "Because that's where your [monetary] resources come
from to let you operate women's basketball at a really high level....</TE>
<TE>   "When football does well it helps everybody out."</TE>

<LD>Wednesday vs. Cal State Fullerton (1-4), 7:30 p.m. -- This will be
the first meeting between the Trojans (2-3) and Titans. USC had to
scramble to put this game on the schedule after a tentative plan to
play in Hawaii's Rainbow Classic over the holidays was squelched by
an Ohio judge who upheld an NCAA decree that prohibits schools from
playing in more than two exempt events every four years.</LD>

<LD>USC (4-2) vs. No. 5 Connecticut (5-0), Hartford (Conn.) Civic Center,
11 a.m. -- USC Coach Chris Gobrecht said the defending NCAA champion
Huskies are difficult to play no matter the venue, but she is happy
the game is not on the Connecticut campus. "The further you can get
away from Storrs [Conn.] the better," Gobrecht said. A bigger concern
is the health of guard Jessica Cheeks, who was limping on a sore left
ankle in practice Saturday and could be questionable for today's
game.</LD>

<HD>Stanford, California Meet Again in Final</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Defending champion Stanford will meet the one team it has lost to
twice this season when the Cardinal plays rival California at 1:30
today in the NCAA men's water polo championship game at Loyola
Marymount's Burns Recreation and Aquatics Center.</LD>
<LD>   The top-seeded Cardinal (23-5) stopped UC San Diego, 10-5, in one
semifinal on Saturday as Mike Derse scored three of his four goals in
the first half en route to a 5-1 lead. Tony Azevedo, Tommy Hopkins,
Peter Hudnut, Matt Moser, Greg Crum and Peter Varellas also scored
for Stanford.</LD>
<LD>   Matt Ellis and Brandon Borso each scored twice for San Diego,
which drew no closer than the 5-2 halftime score.</LD>
<TE>   California (20-6) advanced to the final with a 14-6 victory over
Queens College (N.Y.), which stayed within striking distance of the
Golden Bears for most of the first half. California led, 4-3, late in
the second quarter when it broke open the game with five unanswered
goals spanning the second and third quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Attila Banhidy led the Golden Bears with three goals and Todd
Hylton added two.</TE>
<TE>   Queens College (24-4) was led by Michel Vieira's four goals.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford and California have met three times with each winner
claiming a one-goal victory. The Cardinal won an early season
matchup, 8-7, in the SoCal tournament, but lost, 9-8, to the Golden
Bears in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play and again in the
conference tournament, 8-7.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time we play Cal, everyone goes all out and it's very
physically and mentally challenging," Derse said. "I couldn't think
of a better way to end the season than playing Cal."</TE>

<LD>USC had two scares in the second half of its 78-72 loss to Missouri
when starters Kostas Charissis and Roy Smiley went down and to the
bench with lower leg injuries.</LD>
<LD>   But both returned to the game and left the arena with bags of ice
attached to their respective body parts.</LD>
<LD>   Charissis, who had a Trojan-high eight rebounds in 16 minutes
before fouling out, was diagnosed with a bruise to his right knee
after a scrum for a loose ball and Smiley, who had a game-high four
steals to atone for his four turnovers, endured cramps in his right
calf.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Missouri Coach Quin Snyder was into the spirit of all things
Wooden in getting all over referee Vern Harris after one of his star
players picked up two fouls in the first 1:54 of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "That's two fouls on Rickey Paulding in two minutes, no way,"
Snyder said. "He's a Wooden Award candidate and he has to go to the
bench now."</TE>
<TE>   Paulding, who finished with 12 points and six rebounds in 30
minutes, did not get called for his third foul until the 13:25 mark
of the second half.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The 32.9% USC shot from the field was slightly better than its
shooting percentage in Tuesday's 69-53 loss at UC Santa Barbara. USC
shot a season-low 32.8% against the Gauchos. And the Trojans' 26.7%
(four of 15) rate from beyond the three-point arc was a season low.</TE>
<TE>   But USC's 83.3% (20 of 24) success rate from the free-throw line
Saturday was a season high, eclipsing the 81% (17 of 21) the Trojans
converted in their season-opening 81-68 win over UC Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Without UCLA in the Wooden Classic for only the third time in nine
years -- and with UCLA and Washington State playing to determine
USC's bowl fate -- attendance seemed even more sparse than the
announced crowd of 9,889.</TE>
<TE>   The field next year should be a dramatically better draw: UCLA
plays Kentucky in a rematch of the first Wooden Classic matchup in
1994, an 82-81 UCLA victory.</TE>
<TE>   The other game also will be a strong draw: Kansas vs. Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Honoring John Wooden is part of the tradition at the Wooden
Classic, and each coach this year was asked to mention a little bit
of Wooden's wisdom.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri's Snyder told a story about USC's Henry Bibby, who played
for Wooden at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Bibby and I were getting a cup of coffee and sneaking a few
Krispy Kremes on the way over," Snyder said.</TE>
<TE>   "And I heard him say, 'Be quick, don't hurry.' "</TE>
<TE>   Bibby recalled another Wooden saying: "Discipline yourself, so
others don't have to."</TE>
<TE>   "As most of the L.A. writers know, I'm big on discipline."</TE>
<TE>   Most of his players who have been suspended at one time or another
know it too.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Georgia (3-3), playing without a center on the roster and no
player over 6 feet 8, is awaiting word on whether center Steve Thomas
will regain his academic eligibility Dec. 17.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just keeping the ship going until he gets back," forward
Jarvis Hayes said.</TE>

<HD>Military Rule Not Likely in Postwar Iraq</HD>
<DH>The U.S. is talking to dozens of countries about
establishing a global civilian coalition that would precede native
governance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Wright and Doyle McManus</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration is talking to allies about governing a
postwar Iraq under a U.N. mandate or through an international
civilian coalition, abandoning proposals for U.S. military rule
during an expected two-year transition back to Iraqi rule, senior
administration officials say.</LD>
<LD>   As a model for the process, the United States increasingly is
looking at the international civilian administration established in
1999 for Kosovo -- a province of Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic
-- rather than the military rule of Japan or Germany after World War
II, the sources say. Instead of assuming full responsibility for
Iraq, Washington wants to bring in other resources and international
institutions to share the burden -- as well as the potential benefits
-- of a complex and sensitive transition in the oil-rich country.</LD>
<LD>   "Interagency discussions are still ongoing, but the idea of a
military governorship or a figure like Gen. [Douglas] MacArthur
running Iraq is really no longer considered a viable answer," said a
State Department official.</LD>
<TE>   MacArthur oversaw the occupation of Japan following World War II.</TE>
<TE>   "There's growing recognition of the need for an international
imprimatur, or U.N. support or a coalition of like-minded nations --
always in close concert with the Iraqis themselves," the official
added.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Washington has approached about 50 nations seeking help
for a potential military offensive to oust Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, U.S. officials are now exploring a potential postwar role
with dozens of countries.</TE>
<TE>   "A big part of our message is that you have to begin thinking
about the post-Saddam period, and now is the time to get involved,"
said a well-placed U.S. official who requested anonymity. "It's
contingency only at this stage, and it's not a done deal. But they
are responding."</TE>
<TE>   Like strategy for a potential armed conflict with Iraq, U.S.
planning for a postwar period began long before the United Nations
recently launched a new weapons inspection program in the country.
The planning is based on the assumption that Hussein's regime will
not fully cooperate with the U.N., sparking a U.S.-led assault.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the inspections program, Iraq handed over thousands of
pages of documents to U.N. officials Saturday, denying it has weapons
of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for a postwar Iraq are still a long way from being
finalized, and the U.S. military is likely to play the leading role
in the first stage of a transition, U.S. officials say. But the U.S.
goal is now to make that period as brief as possible in what may be
the chaotic aftermath of decades of authoritarian rule and to quickly
open the way for an international administration, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   After a U.S.-led bombing campaign forced Yugoslav troops to
withdraw from Kosovo in 1999, the U.N. set up an interim
administration. It was backed by a security force led by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, a reconstruction plan orchestrated by
the European Union and a humanitarian effort run by the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "We're using Kosovo as the model. We want a civilian
administrator, not a military person. And we'd prefer a non-U.S.
person," such as a European diplomat, an administration official
said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. mission in Kosovo has been led by French, Danish and
German administrators.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd be quite happy to see Iraq under U.N. mandate too," the
administration official added. "That should be quite feasible if the
war is fought under clear authorization of the [U.N.] Security
Council."</TE>
<TE>   After months of intense debate inside the Bush administration, the
growing consensus about sharing responsibility for post-Hussein Iraq
reflects the Pentagon's reluctance to remain entrenched there as it
has been in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "Take the problems we've seen in Afghanistan and multiply by 30.
That's Iraq," said the administration official, who also requested
that his name be withheld.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has also tentatively concluded that the
leadership of a post-Hussein Iraq would most likely come from within
Iraq, not from among the exiled opposition groups backed by
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The administration is increasingly frustrated with the Iraqi exile
groups, which are scheduled to open a long-deferred conference this
week in London. On the eve of the meeting, set to bring together all
the major ethnic and religious factions, the groups are divided on
several issues.</TE>
<TE>   "In my personal view, the next leader of Iraq is going to be
someone inside the country," said a second senior State Department
official. "It's unlikely that anybody who's been outside the country
for 35 years is going to be the next leader of Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest disputes within the opposition has been an
insistence by Iraqi National Congress leader Ahmad Chalabi that the
groups form a government in exile or an equivalent body, a move U.S.
officials staunchly oppose. Several top Pentagon, National Security
Council and State Department officials met with the opposition last
week in an attempt to quash any jockeying for top positions in a
post-Hussein era.</TE>
<TE>   The White House last week also named Zalmay Khalilzad, who serves
as special envoy for Afghanistan, as ambassador to the "free Iraqis"
to more closely coordinate their efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Washington expects that at their conference, the opposition groups
will come up with an "advisory entity" or "executive committee," as
well as some guiding principles for a new government in Iraq,
according to administration sources.</TE>
<TE>   In a signal of deepening U.S. intent to end Hussein's 23-year
rule, Sens. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) and Charles Hagel (R-Neb.)
made a surprise visit this weekend to Iraq's northern Kurdistan, an
autonomous region protected by U.S. and British warplanes since 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not know what the next weeks and months will bring, but I do
know what the future must bring for you and for Iraq -- a country
that is united, that addresses the goal of democracy and that
respects the rights of all its citizens," Biden told a hastily
assembled session of the Kurds' 105-member parliament. "We will stand
with you in your effort to build a united Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Biden and Hagel both serve on the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee; Biden is its outgoing chairman.</TE>

<HD>Iraq Gives U.N. Weapons List, Prods Kuwaitis</HD>
<DH>The 12,000 pages could take weeks to translate and analyze.
Hussein apologizes for his 1990 invasion but condemns the emirate's
leaders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley and Sonni Efron</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Iraqi President Saddam Hussein made a grand gesture of cooperation
with the United Nations on Saturday, turning over a nearly
12,000-page inventory of materials he possesses that could be used
for weapons.</LD>
<LD>   But almost immediately, his open hand of conciliation closed into
a fist.</LD>
<LD>   At nearly the same time that Iraqi officials handed over their
report in Baghdad, Hussein released a statement on Kuwait,
apologizing to the emirate's people for Iraq's 1990 invasion but also
criticizing the leadership and applauding terrorist attacks against
U.S. soldiers there.</LD>
<TE>   "It's his first mistake," said Henri J. Barkey, chairman of the
international relations department at Lehigh University and a former
Iraq analyst at the State Department. "Saddam is trying to appeal to
the Arab street, but I think it's going to backfire."</TE>
<TE>   Kuwait, which lies between Iraq's southern border and the Persian
Gulf, would be an important staging ground for a U.S.-led invasion of
Iraq. The royal family's cooperation with the U.S. has been a
contentious issue among Kuwaitis who view the Bush administration as
a foe of Islam. An American serviceman posted there for exercises was
killed by Islamic extremists, and Hussein's lauding of the attack
seemed designed to incite more.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter read by Information Minister Mohammed Said Sahaf on
Iraqi television, Hussein apologized to God and Kuwait for the 1990
invasion that sparked the Persian Gulf War. But he also condemned
Kuwaiti leaders for conspiring with "infidels" against Iraq and for
using the country's oil money for personal gain.</TE>
<TE>   "Why will not the faithful, the devoted and the holy warriors in
Kuwait meet with their counterparts in Iraq under the tent of their
creator," the letter asked, "instead of under the tent of London or
Washington and the Zionist entity [Israel] to discuss their affairs,
foremost the jihad [holy struggle] against the occupation of infidel
armies?"</TE>
<TE>   Instead of winning support for Iraq, some analysts said, Hussein's
statements could turn sympathies against him.</TE>
<TE>   "The Kuwaiti royal family was always against him. It will steel
their determination because he's going over their head and asking the
Kuwaiti people to rebel against their support of the U.S.," Barkey
said. "It might also show other Arab leaders that Saddam Hussein is
still convinced he can take over Kuwait and lead the Arab world."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Kuwaiti officials swiftly rejected the apology, with
Information Minister Sheik Ahmed al Fahd al Sabah saying, "The speech
contained incitement and encouragement of terrorist acts."</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's letter was part of a pattern of mixed messages, a charm
offensive designed to stave off war. But his efforts strike many as
more offensive than charming.</TE>
<TE>   The information turned over Saturday takes up 11,807 pages, along
with 352 pages of supplements and computer disks containing 529
megabytes of data allegedly detailing all materials in Iraq that
could be used for weapons or missiles, whether they were intended for
military or peaceful purposes. The documents were to be flown to the
International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna and U.N. headquarters in
New York so that officials can remove any information that could be
used by others to produce weapons.</TE>
<TE>   But the translation and analyses required mean that it could be
weeks before the report can be distributed to the 15 U.N. Security
Council members.</TE>
<TE>   Two days earlier, Hussein called on the people of Iraq to support
U.N. weapons inspections to prove that the country has eliminated its
weapons programs and deserves an end to a decade of sanctions. But
the same day, Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan called the
inspectors "spies" for U.S. and Israeli intelligence services.</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors completed their first week of searches for chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons materials without impediment, but U.N.
and U.S. officials were not quite ready to call Iraq helpful.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not using the word 'cooperation' because it's a little
early," Hans Blix, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, said Friday. "If
they are in fact hiding anything, well, that wouldn't be
cooperation."</TE>
<TE>   Although Iraqi officials ceremoniously handed over their new
"Currently Accurate, Full and Complete Declaration" of Iraq's weapons
Saturday, a full day before the Security Council's deadline, few
observers expect it to be a model of honesty.</TE>
<TE>   During the previous U.N. inspection regime, from 1991 to 1998,
Iraq turned in eight separate "full, final and complete declarations"
of its weapons programs, none of which turned out to be either full,
final or complete, former chief inspector Richard Butler has said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Iraq denied having manufactured VX, a lethal nerve
gas. However, inspectors "found documents regarding VX in buildings
that had been bombed during Desert Storm and found VX in soil samples
nearby," a senior U.S. administration official said. "Confronted by
the evidence, Iraq admitted producing VX."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Bush administration officials said they had evidence
that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, despite Baghdad's repeated
denials. They said that in itself was enough to put Iraq in "material
breach" of the U.N. resolution authorizing inspections -- even before
the report had been handed over.</TE>
<TE>   That inventory is "the first true test of whether Iraq is willing
to cooperate and to be disarmed," the senior U.S. official said
Friday. "Inspections were designed as a means to verify that Iraq had
voluntarily given up" its weapons of mass destruction programs, he
said. Inspectors were not meant to engage in a massive game of hide
and seek in a country the size of California, he said, but ideally
should be led to weapons sites by Iraqi authorities or through tips
from local scientists.</TE>
<TE>   "Without cooperation by Iraq, inspections cannot work. Iraq will
always have the power to deceive, deny and ultimately to defy U.N.
inspectors," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the Bush administration has faced criticism for
failing to produce a "smoking gun" of evidence to support the
president's claim that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction,
including a program to obtain nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating that the regime's declaration could prompt a revival
of such charges, administration officials stressed how difficult it
is to catch Iraq in a lie.</TE>
<TE>   Any expectation that the United States would be able to wave
satellite photos of Iraqi weapons in front of the world, as the U.S.
was able to do during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, is not
realistic given the nature of today's intelligence and the
sophisticated Iraqi concealment and disinformation operations, the
U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our adversaries have over the years learned how to deny us
information from various sources. In 1962, you could have [then-U.N.
Ambassador] Adlai Stevenson stand up and present photographs of
missile sites being set up in Cuba. That was 40 years ago. In those
40 years, countries like Iraq and others have become very practiced
at denying us the ability to collect those types of information," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although there has been much speculation about such a surprise
scenario, the administration is apparently hoping that, in time,
Hussein will trip himself up.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a long pattern of noncompliance that exists now," said
the official. "I don't think it should take that long."</TE>

<HD>As Bowl Picture Emerges, Bloom Could Be Off Rose</HD>
<DH>A tangled championship system may sideline a traditional --
and lucrative -- rivalry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Wharton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>College football ended its thrilling and often baffling regular
season Saturday, with a flurry of big games that decided conference
titles and national rankings but left fans with a big question.</LD>
<LD>   What happens now?</LD>
<LD>   This much is certain: Miami won its regular-season finale to
remain undefeated and will play undefeated Ohio State for the
national championship Jan. 3.</LD>
<TE>   But equally important was a matchup of lesser teams, Washington
State and UCLA, that had national repercussions.</TE>
<TE>   With Washington State's 48-27 victory over UCLA, the Cougars
secured a spot in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1 and, in all likelihood,
bumped USC off the road to Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans figure to land on their feet in either the Sugar Bowl
or the Orange Bowl, leaving the Rose Bowl -- which has been the most
consistently popular and financially successful of the bowl games --
looking like the big loser.</TE>
<TE>   For decades the game has featured teams from the Pacific 10 and
Big Ten but, on Saturday night, officials were resigned to missing
out on that traditional and lucrative rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   Blame it on the bowl championship series, the controversial system
that determines the eventual champion. This formula took Ohio State
for the title game and is expected to send Iowa -- the Big Ten's
other top team -- to the Orange Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves less-appealing Oklahoma or possibly Florida State as
potential opponents for Washington State -- much to the chagrin of
the local tourism industry, and several thousand Iowa fans who have
purchased plane tickets, travel packages and Rose Parade seats that
are not always refundable.</TE>
<TE>   Rose Bowl chief executive Mitch Dorger, who last week said he
would be "severely disappointed" at losing Iowa, tempered his
reaction.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the system everyone signed up for," he said. "We'll get
another great team and we'll have a great game."</TE>
<TE>   But the college football powers-that-be apparently got the message
anyway, saying they will consider his displeasure when they evaluate
the BCS after the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I know this has been a very difficult year for the Rose Bowl,"
said Michael Tranghese, the BCS coordinator. "A healthy Rose Bowl is
a good thing for college football and that has got to be on the table
when we do our review."</TE>
<TE>   Pac-10 Cashes In</TE>
<TE>   There was a bright side for the Pac-10. With one school in a BCS
bowl, the conference would get about $13.5 million to split among its
teams. With a second team in, it will get an additional $4.5 million
on top of that.</TE>
<TE>   As if this scenario weren't complicated enough, nothing is final
until today, when conference commissioners and bowl executives --
like kids choosing sides in a sandlot -- make their selections in
closed-door meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the expected breakdown:</TE>
<TE>   The Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Ariz., gets Miami and Ohio State, the
lone undefeated teams, for the championship game on Jan. 3.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange Bowl on Jan. 2 in Miami gets the next selection and is
expected to take Iowa. Florida State or even USC could be the
opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Rose Bowl executives pick next and said they would give strong
consideration to Oklahoma and Florida State as Washington State's
opponent. USC, which lost to the Cougars in overtime this season,
would be a longshot to get a rematch.</TE>
<TE>   The Sugar Bowl in New Orleans has Georgia and could pair the
Bulldogs against USC or Florida State.</TE>
<TE>   Rose Bowl executives see only a glimmer of hope that a
last-second, backroom deal would deliver Iowa to them. After the
major bowls fill their slots, lesser games will vie for the rest.</TE>
<TE>   Gone are the days when bowls were locked into agreements with
various conferences, an arrangement that was orderly but rarely
brought together the two best teams.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, college football created the BCS, ranking teams by
way of polls, computer formulas, strength of schedule and losses. The
four major bowls take turns playing host to the championship.</TE>
<TE>   "The BCS is a system put in place to bring the No. 1 and No. 2
teams together," Tranghese said. "It has never promised to do
anything more than that."</TE>
<TE>   But in plucking the two best teams, the BCS can create havoc
below.</TE>
<TE>   Bowls are left to scramble, looking not only at won-loss records
but also at teams with a reputation for bringing lots of fans to buy
tickets, fill hotels and eat at restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa has "an incredible fan base," Orange Bowl spokesman Joe
Hornstein said. "From that aspect, they look like an incredible
team."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State went so far as to send its president, athletic
director and coach to Miami last week to guarantee the Orange Bowl
Kansas State could sell 25,000 tickets if that school were chosen.</TE>
<TE>   "In some ways it reveals the worst in college sports," said Murray
Sperber, an Indiana University professor and author of several books
on the business of intercollegiate athletics. "This is a kind of
hodgepodge system based on power and greed."</TE>
<TE>   Rose Bowl executives, long shielded from such dealings, are
learning.</TE>
<TE>   When the BCS was created, they knew that once every four years
they would play host to the championship and forsake their normal
rivalry. That happened last season when Miami and Nebraska met in
Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   But Dorger and his cohorts did not foresee a season like this,
when the first- and second-place teams from one of their conferences
would be scooped up, forcing them to look elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   They also failed to appreciate the complexity of a BCS formula
that, given a UCLA victory, would have sent USC and Iowa their way.
Complex enough that it had Trojan fans rooting for a Bruin victory
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "The Orange, the Sugar and Fiesta bowls have had to deal with
this," Tranghese said. "This is the first time it has happened to the
Rose Bowl."</TE>
<TE>   Time Is Short</TE>
<TE>   To compound the situation, executives now face a crunch in
promoting their game. Whereas they once finalized their matchup by
Thanksgiving, this time they must wait until today's final
selections.</TE>
<TE>   "We should already be working to sell merchandise and arrange
ticket packages," Dorger said. "This puts pressure on us."</TE>
<TE>   Fans might feel the pinch too.</TE>
<TE>   "It's harder for them to get transportation," Pac-10 assistant
commissioner Jim Muldoon said. "The longer they wait, the more they
might pay."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Pasadena restaurateurs and hoteliers remained optimistic
that a Washington State-Oklahoma matchup would be a money-maker. "I'm
sure their fans will come out," said John Luke, general manager of
the Hilton Hotel Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Tranghese also looked on the bright side of the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "Saturday was a great day," he said. "All you have to do is look
at the television ratings. They'll be through the roof."</TE>
<TE>   Either way, the six major conferences are contractually bound to
the system through 2005, so it is uncertain what changes -- including
an oft-discussed playoff -- would result from an off-season review.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what to tell you," Hornstein of the Orange Bowl
said. "This is the BCS."</TE>

<HD>Bombs Kill 17 in Bangladeshi Cinemas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DHAKA, Bangladesh</DL>
<LD>Bombs tore through four Bangladeshi movie theaters packed with
Muslims celebrating the end of Ramadan on Saturday, killing at least
17 people and wounding 200, police and witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   The bombs went off in and around the normally quiet tourist town
of Mymensingh, 70 miles north of the capital, Dhaka, starting at 6
p.m. A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
explosives appeared to have been planted in the projection rooms of
the theaters.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the victims were injured by falling brick or steel. The
death toll could rise because dozens of the wounded were in critical
condition, doctors said.</LD>
<TE>   The theaters were crowded with people celebrating Eid al-Fitr, the
Muslim festival marking the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.
About 3,000 people were believed to be inside and around the theaters
when the explosions occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a terrible scene. Doctors were overwhelmed with so many
injured people being brought at the hospital," said Muzahed Ahmed, a
university teacher who took part in the rescue work.</TE>
<TE>   No one claimed responsibility for the blasts, but early today,
police said they had arrested more than 20 suspects. Two opposition
leaders and two writers also reportedly were detained; however, it
was not clear if their detentions were linked to the bombings.</TE>
<TE>   Home Minister Altaf Hossain Chowdhury said Saturday that political
opponents might have been behind the explosions in a bid to try to
destabilize the government. He also said the attacks could be the
work of the Al Qaeda terror network and ordered a national security
alert.</TE>

<HD>U.S., Vietnam in Dispute Over Catfish Exports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Lamb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LONG XUYEN, Vietnam</DL>
<LD>Nguyen Hoang Kha has no regrets that he sold his small construction
business and invested in catfish farming when Vietnam and the United
States ended a generation of enmity and became trading partners. The
decision lifted him out of poverty, offering opportunity beyond his
dreams as his communist homeland changes to a free-market economy.</LD>
<LD>   "I did all this without a bank loan and with a lot of hard work,"
said Kha, 47, his hand sweeping across acres of catfish cages
stretching up the waterways of the Mekong River. "But it is mine, not
the government's. If it goes well, I benefit. If it goes badly, I
lose money. It is a risk I am willing to take."</LD>
<LD>   Like Kha, hundreds of farmers in the Mekong Delta are talking like
capitalists these days as catfish -- the whiskered, flat-headed,
bottom-dwellers -- has become Vietnam's fastest-growing export to the
United States, grabbing nearly 20% of the $590-million U.S. market
and providing powerful ammunition for reformers who want to lay
Vietnam's Marxist economy to rest.</LD>
<TE>   But the 300,000 or so mostly poor Vietnamese engaged in catfish
farming haven't had much time to savor their success. Last December,
10 days after a bilateral trade agreement between Vietnam and the
United States went into effect, they found themselves in the middle
of a trade dispute with the U.S. that threatens to penalize them for
putting their fish on America's barbecues. The clash left Vietnam
perplexed and resentful and could, the Hanoi government says,
threaten relations between the two countries.</TE>
<TE>   Vietnam's adversaries are America's catfish farmers, who have
spent millions of marketing dollars to transform the image of the
fish dubbed "river rats" into a delicacy. "Catfish: The Cultured
Fish," says one slogan. The campaign has helped make catfish the
fourth-best-selling fish in the U.S., after tuna, Alaskan pollock and
salmon. But concerned by falling prices and Americans' growing
penchant for frozen Vietnamese fillets, they have set out to teach
Vietnam a lesson about the hardball world of global trade.</TE>
<TE>   Backed by a powerful political ally, incoming Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), the Mississippi-based Catfish Farmers of
America began advertising in trade publications. "Never trust a
catfish with a foreign accent," one ad said. Then the group got
Congress to slip a proviso into law declaring that of the 2,500
species of catfish, only those raised in America, known by the
scientific name Ictaluridae, could be sold as catfish; Vietnam's
species -- which look like catfish and taste like catfish -- weren't
catfish. They were basa or tra, to which U.S. diners asked, "What's
that?"</TE>
<TE>   In June, the Catfish Farmers of America filed a petition charging
Vietnam with "dumping" catfish in the U.S., selling at below-market
cost. The group is seeking import duties of as much as 190% on basa
and tra. The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled in August that
there was a "reasonable indication" the U.S. industry was threatened
by "material injury" by dumping. A final U.S. ruling on the dispute
is expected in April.</TE>
<TE>   "The popular mood at home is bad over this problem," said Vu Quang
Minh, chief economist for the Vietnamese Embassy in Washington. "The
bilateral trade agreement took four years of negotiation, and we have
people who didn't want to rely on trade with the U.S. Now they're
saying, 'See, I told you so.' I'm sure this is an economic issue, not
a political one, but the timing is very unfortunate."</TE>
<TE>   Valerie Slater, a Washington attorney representing the Catfish
Farmers of America, notes that the dumping petition is not related to
the bilateral trade agreement and that after years of running a rigid
state-controlled economy, Vietnam has been exposed to the big leagues
of fair-trade practices.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States has filed dumping cases again and again against
all kinds of products, some of them from our closest trading
partners, in Canada, Europe, Latin America," she said. "If you are
going to trade in this country, you have to be aware of the laws and
the definition of fair trade."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Hanoi officials are irate.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam
and later helped forge reconciliation between Hanoi and Washington
and encouraged Vietnam to open its markets, calls the catfish war "a
troubling example of the very protectionism we have urged the
Vietnamese to abandon."</TE>
<TE>   As part of its investigation into Vietnam's catfish industry, the
Commerce Department judged the nation as having a "nonmarket
economy," a decision that could hurt Hanoi's export of products other
than catfish. The ruling appears to support the U.S. catfish farmers'
contention that Mekong Delta farmers sell their catfish at
artificially low prices because of government subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   "Compared with many Eastern European countries recognized by the
United States as a market economy," stated Tuoi Tre, the Communist
Party's youth newspaper, "Vietnam has taken greater steps than them
in applying economic market principles." Other papers have commented
that Washington subsidizes U.S. farmers with $180 billion a year.
Does that mean the U.S. has a nonmarket economy, they asked.</TE>
<TE>   "The government provides training classes for farmers and
infrastructure like roads ... nothing else," said Doan Huu Luc, chief
agriculturist for An Giang province, Vietnam's largest catfish
producer. "Farmers can sell to private or state processors. Their
costs are low because labor is cheap, the feed is largely locally
grown rice and wheat, and the flow of the Mekong River provides a
good natural setting for raising fish. Go to the market down the
street and you see that catfish sell here for only" 25 cents a pound.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen Hoang Kha, the catfish farmer, said the dispute hasn't yet
hurt his business, but it will if the Commerce Department rules
against Vietnam. He added: "I've heard the U.S. says we're selling
below cost. Why would we do that? I've got to pay myself at the end
of the day. I'm not a charity."</TE>

<HD>Former Afghan Judge Criticized for Leaving Her Hair
Uncovered on U.S. Trip</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Valerie Reitman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>When Marzia Basel, one of Afghanistan's few female judges, recently
spent several weeks in the United States, she met with President
Bush, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other dignitaries to
appeal for more assistance for her homeland.</LD>
<LD>   Returning home, she was greeted by derogatory headlines and sneers
because, while in the U.S., she hadn't always worn her chador, the
scarf used by many Muslim women to cover their hair.</LD>
<LD>   The controversy began when the television station in Kabul, the
Afghan capital, broadcast footage of her and 13 other Afghan women in
a vaunted U.S. State Department international leadership-training
program. The private weekly Thubat, or Proof, criticized their
behavior. "These women had gone as modest women but dishonored the
people of Afghanistan," the paper wrote. "Afghan government officials
made a big mistake sending them to the U.S."</LD>
<TE>   Several publications reported that the Afghan government had fired
Basel, one of 32 female judges among several hundred jurists. A
senior court official dismissed that suggestion, and Basel herself
says she quit the judgeship, which pays $54 a month, to join UNICEF,
where she is building a juvenile-justice program.</TE>
<TE>   She said she's angry, hurt and depressed about the criticism and
fears for her safety. "I did a lot for my country there," she said.
"Today I want to cry, hearing these things."</TE>
<TE>   Basel blames the media, not the government, for creating the
furor. "Afghan media don't want to learn and be educated. If women
are strong and educated, it will be a problem for them."</TE>
<TE>   As for the chador, she says, "we are Muslims. It's good if we wear
it, but if we don't, it's all right. Lots of Muslim women don't wear
it."</TE>
<TE>   The chador issue has been a lightning rod for controversy
centering on the role of women in Afghan society. Unlike under the
Taliban, which forbade women from going out without their burkas,
today there are no legal restrictions on what women can wear. Still,
social and religious dictates hold powerful sway.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of Afghan women still wear their burkas on the
street, fearing harassment from men if they do not. In recent weeks,
however, many have been pulling them back to expose their faces or
taking them off altogether. Those who don't wear burkas usually wear
a chador, which most keep on inside the workplace.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Fazal Ahmad Manawi says
that, legally, women should have a choice about what to wear. "But
personally," he adds, "we advise our people to observe our culture
wherever they are."</TE>
<TE>   Safia Siddiqi, 38, president of planning and international
relations at the Ministry of Women's Affairs, never wore a chador
when she lived in Canada, where she spent several years as a refugee
before returning to Afghanistan recently. During an interview at her
office, she wore a skirt and blazer with a chador. "So many issues
are more important than whether women wear a chador," she said,
citing security and health.</TE>
<TE>   "We've just gone through 23 years of problems, especially the last
six years under the Taliban," she said. "It's our idea that it's not
difficult to put a piece of cloth on your head. It's respectful and
at least we should wear it. If we remove it, it means the future is a
problem" for this society.</TE>
<TE>   Basel, too, wears the chador in Kabul. During a recent interview
at the office of the Women Justices Assn., black fishnet stockings
peeked out from beneath her long black wool skirt. Inside, she let
her black veil drop to her shoulders, but pulled it up when she went
outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   "While we're inside Afghanistan, we have to observe the customs of
Afghanistan," she said. "But not while I'm outside." She no longer
wears a burka, as she did under the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Basel, 35, is single -- unusual for women in Afghanistan, where
marriages are almost always arranged between families. She grew up in
a liberal family: Her father was a judge, and her two sisters also
became attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Basel said she liked the "feeling of women in America," which she
got from the five weeks she spent traveling across the U.S. as part
of the State Department program. "They were really impressed with the
situation of women in Afghanistan. Some of them really cried with
us."</TE>
<TE>   While walking through Hollywood, an American woman proselytizing
on a street corner admonished a translator with the group that she
shouldn't be wearing such a short skirt. The proselytizer teasingly
turned to a man walking by and said, "Do you think women should wear
such short skirts?" The man jokingly retorted, "I like women wearing
nothing."</TE>
<TE>   All of them "laughed and laughed," recalled Basel, completely
defusing any tension.</TE>
<TE>   That's the way it should be, she says. "People should be free to
do what they want as long as they don't bother others."</TE>
<TE>   The Koran, she said, exhorts women to cover "their beautiful
parts, such as their breasts, hips and legs, but doesn't say they
should hide their faces or cover themselves with burkas."</TE>
<TE>   "Real Islam is not the Islam [they] are expressing," she said of
her critics. "It is such a great religion that gave women rights and
equality. But people are illiterate, and they don't know what real
Islam is."</TE>

<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>A former Italian policeman accused of hijacking two airplanes,
including a flight that landed safely in France last month, hanged
himself in his cell, prosecutors said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Stefano Savorani, 29, had a history of mental illness. Guards
discovered his body shortly after midnight Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Savorani had been held in the eastern French city of Lyon since
the Nov. 27 hijacking attempt, during which he claimed to be a member
of Al Qaeda.</LD>
<TE>   On the flight from Bologna, Italy, to Paris, Savorani brandished a
TV remote control he said was connected to a bomb. The plane landed
safely in Lyon, and Savorani surrendered after releasing the
passengers and crew. No explosives were found.</TE>
<TE>   A Lyon judge placed Savorani under investigation, and psychiatric
experts were to determine if he was fit to stand trial.</TE>
<TE>   The Italian news agency ANSA has quoted his mother as saying her
son was in treatment for schizophrenia. Because of his mental
problems, a court did not press charges against Savorani after his
first hijack attempt in 1999.</TE>

<HD>Georgia Rounds Up Chechens, Kills Rebels</HD>
<DH>In a crackdown on terrorism, authorities also extradite a

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>TBILISI, Georgia</DL>
<LD>Under pressure from Moscow to halt rebel activity on its soil,
Georgia said Saturday that it had detained scores of Chechens and
killed at least five guerrillas linked to deadly blasts in Russia
three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   As part of what it calls a broad anti-terrorism operation, Georgia
also extradited to Russia Yusuf Krymshamkhalov, who Moscow says
belongs to a group of Chechens behind the 1999 explosions that killed
more than 300 people, Russia's Itar-Tass news agency said.</LD>
<LD>   Moscow has been trying to crush an insurgency in its southern
republic of Chechnya since the early 1990s. Georgia is southwest of
Chechnya.</LD>
<TE>   On Saturday, Georgian authorities took in dozens of people,
including Hizri Aldamov, the chief representative of the Chechen
exile community in Georgia, to be fingerprinted. Also summoned were
relatives of top Chechen rebel envoy Ahmed Zakayev, wanted by Moscow
for alleged terror crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "Interior Ministry and security officials have detained and
checked up about 80 people overnight. Another 12 to 16 are currently
being checked," said Paata Gomelauri, spokesman for Georgia's
Interior Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Hours before the roundup in Tbilisi, Georgian forces killed five
militants also suspected of links to the 1999 blasts.</TE>
<TE>   "As a result of this operation, we destroyed a terrorist gang,
which included prominent terrorists sought by Interpol," said Nika
Laliashvili, spokesman for Georgia's State Security Ministry. He said
the gang may have been responsible for kidnapping Peter Shaw, a
Briton held captive in Georgia for five months.</TE>

<HD>Protesters Call for Reform in Iran</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>TEHRAN</DL>
<LD>Baton-wielding security forces arrested at least 60 people in the
Iranian capital Saturday, a city official said, as thousands gathered
in and around Tehran University to call for political reform.</LD>
<LD>   The demonstrations, which coincided with National Students' Day,
were the most significant sign in recent weeks that ordinary Iranians
are willing to join students in the largest pro-reform protests in
the nation in at least three years.</LD>
<LD>   "Around 60 to 70 people have been arrested, most of whom are being
questioned," Ali Taala, general director of security and political
affairs at the governor's office in Tehran, told the student news
agency ISNA.</LD>
<TE>   He said the street demonstration, unlike a student rally within
the university campus, had not been authorized and was therefore
illegal. Most arrested were not students, he said.</TE>
<TE>   On campus, at least 2,000 students chanted "Death to
dictatorship!" and called for a national referendum on Iran's
political future.</TE>
<TE>   "We are calling on you to respect the people's choice," student
leader Mohammed Ajdadi said. "We are the last generation to speak to
you through dialogue. The younger generation is already preparing its
fists."</TE>
<TE>   The rally was marked by sporadic violence as students and members
of a hard-line Islamic militia hurled stones over the high university
fence.</TE>
<TE>   The protests reflect simmering tension in the country of 65
million where President Mohammad Khatami's reformist government is at
loggerheads with powerful hard-liners opposed to his agenda of
greater democracy and social freedom.</TE>

<DL>MONOKO-ZOHI, Ivory Coast</DL>
<LD>The embattled government urged able-bodied young men Saturday to
mobilize for the battlefront to fight a rebel uprising that threatens
to consume the West African country.</LD>
<LD>   Men ages 22 to 26 were asked to report to army headquarters in the
commercial capital, Abidjan, beginning Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The call came as rebels and locals in western Ivory Coast said
insurgents had taken another town, Blolekin, and were pushing east
into the heart of the nation, said Maj. Frederic Thomazo, who was
part of a 1,000-strong French contingent in the former colony.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, tensions continued to mount in the wake of the
discovery of a mass grave in the village of Monoko-Zohi. Villagers
said Saturday that the grave contained 120 unarmed civilians killed
by government soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Ivory Coast's army and government strongly denied wrongdoing,
insisting Saturday that the dead were rebels.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, this is very simple," spokesman Col. Jules Yao Yao said by
telephone. "The victims were rebels who were killed in combat. They
then gathered the bodies and buried them together. It's as simple as
that."</TE>
<TE>   However, insurgents denied that their militia was in Monoko-Zohi,
and villagers said the victims were merchants and guest workers on
the region's cocoa and coffee fields. Villagers said the killing
started when six marked Ivory Coast military trucks arrived Nov. 27
carrying uniformed soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers accused the villagers of feeding rebels and then went
from house to house with a list of names, survivors said.</TE>
<TE>   French troops, in Ivory Coast to enforce a now-shattered
cease-fire, first reported the mass grave Friday. Associated Press
viewed the scene Saturday. Monoko-Zohi is about 70 miles northwest of
the government-held city of Daloa.</TE>

<HD>In Brazil, Lula Aide Steering Toward Middle</HD>
<DH>Ex-radical Jose Dirceu helps to shape incoming government
and for now urges moderation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hector Tobar and Paula Gobbi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>RIO DE JANEIRO</DL>
<LD>At each step of his eventful life in Brazilian politics, Jose Dirceu
has been willing to do something daring or even a bit ruthless to
advance his cause. He has served time in prison, allied himself with
armed guerrillas and altered his face through plastic surgery to
throw off a police dragnet.</LD>
<LD>   Dirceu is the eminence grise of the new Brazil, the architect of
the rise to power of President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, known
here as Lula. A Marxist revolutionary who for years lived in exile in
Fidel Castro's Cuba, Dirceu fought with and eventually tamed the
radicals in Lula's own Workers' Party during this year's successful
campaign.</LD>
<LD>   Now Dirceu, 56, is the man most responsible for shaping the face
of Lula's incoming government, according to analysts here. Again, the
ex-radical is a force for moderation. He is telling the Trotskyites,
Maoists and other Marxists who make up a third of party ranks that
deep social reform in Brazil must wait.</LD>
<TE>   "Jose Dirceu is without a doubt the most important political
figure in the Workers' Party and the organizer of the party's move to
the center," said Walder de Goes, president of the Brazilian
Institute of Political Studies.</TE>
<TE>   When Lula announces his Cabinet, perhaps as early as Tuesday,
Dirceu is expected to be named chief of staff.</TE>
<TE>   De Goes compares Dirceu to another famous behind-the-scenes figure
from Brazilian history, Gen. Golbery do Couto e Silva, who in the
1970s acted as a buffer within the military dictatorship between
hard-liners and those calling for a democratic opening.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, leading up to the Jan. 1 inauguration, Dirceu has
been shuttling back and forth between the party's base in Sao Paulo
and Brasilia, the capital, trying to smooth the road ahead for the
new president.</TE>
<TE>   Lula will face a difficult first year in office. Brazil's public
debt stands at $260 billion. Under the terms of a $30-billion bailout
granted by the International Monetary Fund in October, the outgoing
government of Fernando Henrique Cardoso agreed to slash spending.
Lula has said he'll abide by the accord.</TE>
<TE>   And yet many Brazilians look to the president-elect -- a former
trade unionist and the son of impoverished migrants -- to make good
on his promise to end hunger and address this nation's unrelenting
poverty. Lula also has said he will take a more nationalistic
approach to trade negotiations with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 28, Dirceu told the party's congressional caucus that the
Brazilian people will have to endure at least a year of austerity
before the Workers' Party delivers on its most important promises.</TE>
<TE>   "The country already knows 2003 will be a difficult year," he
said, adding that alliances with center-right parties might be
necessary. "We are not going to undertake an ideological
confrontation with the United States because the correlation of
forces does not allow it. We have to speak less and do more."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Dirceu said the party will remain true to its
ideological roots. "We are leftists and socialists," he said. "The
elite has failed, the 'Washington consensus' has failed," he added,
referring to a set of free-market policies drafted by the IMF and
U.S. economists.</TE>
<TE>   Dirceu has been performing a similar kind of dance between
political extremes for decades now, ever since he left rural Minas
Gerais state to become a student organizer in the 1960s, during the
years of dictatorship.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the Communist Party, then became a member of
Dissidencia, which broke from the party at the height of Brazil's
student movement in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   Arrested at a gathering of the National Students' Union, Dirceu
lingered in a jail cell for a year. He was set free thanks to one of
the most daring episodes of Brazil's guerrilla movement: the 1969
kidnapping of U.S. Ambassador Charles Elbrick.</TE>
<TE>   Grabbed in a Rio de Janeiro ambush, Elbrick was held for four days
until Dirceu and 14 other radicals were freed from prison and flown
to Mexico. Dirceu was granted asylum in Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   He trained as a guerrilla in Cuban military schools for foreign
revolutionaries that Ernesto "Che" Guevara had helped establish. In
1971, Dirceu returned to Brazil clandestinely as part of a guerrilla
group called the Movement for Popular Liberation. "I trained in
guerrilla warfare, yes, but I didn't like it," he said in a later
interview.</TE>
<TE>   After another brief stay in Cuba, he returned to Brazil in 1975,
this time with a new identity and a new face to go with it. He was
now Carlos Henrique Gouveia, a "businessman" and resident of a small
southwestern town. Brazil granted amnesty to former guerrillas in
1979, and he again became Jose Dirceu. A year later he helped found
the Workers' Party with Lula, who had led a series of metal-worker
strikes in Sao Paulo.</TE>
<TE>   Dirceu has always been a respected top-level member of the party,
a dour apparatchik never far from the elbow of the charismatic Lula.
When Lula travels to Washington on Tuesday to speak with President
Bush, Dirceu will be at his side.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Dirceu's former comrades from the days of armed struggle
and exile accept his evolution from revolutionary to mainstream
politician.</TE>
<TE>   "Those times seem very remote, those kinds of people [urban
guerrillas] no longer exist," said Fernando Gabeira, a member of
Congress, who was one of Elbrick's kidnappers. "Many of us went
through the armed struggle but no longer share those ideals."</TE>

<HD>The Myth of China's Middle Class</HD>
<DH>One analyst calls newly emerged sector an 'academic
bubble,' unlikely to be a force.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anthony Kuhn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>BEIJING -- If you believe the advertisements portraying China's
middle class, you might think that their spacious and modern homes
and polished white teeth are representative of this rapidly changing
nation.</LD>
<LD>   But experts warn that Chinese and foreign media have constructed a
far bigger myth: that China's middle class is an emerging force and
that its demands for participation could push the Communist Party
toward political reform.</LD>
<LD>   "China's middle class is an academic bubble," scoffed He Qinglian,
a Chinese economist living in the U.S. She dismisses the middle
class' political demands as insignificant because "the middle class
has developed through reliance on the rich and powerful classes."</LD>
<TE>   The concept of class remains an ideological minefield in this
nominally communist country. Just as sensitive is the perception held
by many ordinary Chinese that the spoils of modernization have gone
to a privileged few.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who've prospered from the reforms are those with power
and connections," said Zhang, an unemployed worker who asked that his
full name not be used.</TE>
<TE>   Had things gone differently, Zhang, 42, might have joined the
middle class. He worked for a state-owned factory in Beijing from
1980 to 1990 but was laid off when his company farmed work out to
rural factories.</TE>
<TE>   Now Zhang peddles postcards and Mao Tse-tung's Little Red Book of
quotations to tourists outside the Forbidden City by day. At night,
he retires to the shack he built on the property of his parents'
employers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just too hard. You're working one day and unemployed the
next," he said. "Ordinary people have no feeling of security or
stability."</TE>
<TE>   Qinghua University sociologist Sun Liping sees in people like
Zhang a failed middle class. In an essay on the Internet, he warns of
a "fractured society" in which people in the same country live in
different technological ages.</TE>
<TE>   While "the advanced sectors of this backward nation are becoming
more advanced, the distance between these sectors and the rest of
society is growing larger," he says.</TE>
<TE>   By most estimates, China's middle class represents a negligible
bulge in the country's income distribution. A study by the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, or CASS, this year estimated China's
middle class at about 110 million -- just 15% of the working
population -- compared with nearly 60% in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   In developed countries where the middle class is statistically
dominant, a graph of overall income distribution appears roughly
football-shaped, with a fat middle and tapered ends. China's income
distribution, analysts say, is like a pyramid tipped on its side: as
the rich get richer, the pyramid's spire grows longer, and as reforms
throw more people out of work, the pyramid's base expands upward.</TE>
<TE>   According to the CASS study, the middle class itself is
pyramid-shaped. The study found that the upper middle class, middle
middle class and lower middle class make up 18%, 37% and 45% of the
overall class respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Sociologist Zhang Wanli wrote in the study that if the trend
continues, China's middle class could "go the way of the 'national
bourgeoisie,' " the former middle class that was torn apart in the
wake of the Communist Revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Zhang argues that China's middle class lacks a clear identity and
values and that its boundaries are difficult to define. Many Chinese,
she observes, cannot differentiate the middle class from the
country's elites.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts are not ruling out that the middle class will someday
achieve a critical mass in China. Anyone living in a major Chinese
city can be dazzled by the neon lights, slick ads and cell
phone-chattering throngs into believing that China's middle class is
already dominant.</TE>
<TE>   China's leadership, meanwhile, has noted the scholars' warnings
and apparently realizes that, in the short term, the threat of income
disparities will outweigh any threat from the middle class.</TE>
<TE>   "Bearing in mind the objective of common prosperity," President
Jiang Zemin said last month, "we should try to raise the proportion
of the middle-income group and increase the income of the low-income
group."</TE>

<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Mexico City's populist mayor urged residents to call a toll-free
number Saturday and vote on whether he has earned the right to stay
in office for the remaining 3 1/2 years of his term.</LD>
<LD>   Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he will honor the results of the
two-day phone referendum and resign Jan. 1 if residents of the
capital don't think he's doing a good job.</LD>
<LD>   Those dialing the number were told to push 1 to keep the mayor, or
2 to urge him to quit.</LD>
<TE>   Lopez Obrador is a rising star within the leftist Democratic
Revolution Party who boasts approval ratings of more than 64%. Many
consider him an early contender for the 2006 presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few hundred residents had called during the first seven

<HD>War Simulation in Qatar Another Signal to Iraq</HD>
<DH>Commander of U.S. forces in the region presides over
electronic battlefield in Gulf nation whose ruler welcomes the
military.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Fineman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DOHA, Qatar</DL>
<LD>DOHA, Qatar -- As Baghdad sought Saturday to defuse the threat
against it, the commander of U.S. military forces in the region took
center stage in a high-tech war room in this tiny Persian Gulf nation
and launched the first phase of electronic war games that include a
possible U.S. invasion of Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Seated at a command table before a 25-foot-square battlefield
screen in Qatar's Camp As Sayliyah, Army Gen. Tommy Franks and more
than 200 members of his staff finalized an array of U.S. military
scenarios that will be part of the command-and-control exercise,
which formally begins here Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Dubbed Internal Look, it is the first such exercise staged outside
the U.S. -- and within the boundaries of some of the most strategic
real estate in Franks' U.S. Central Command, which covers 25 nations.</LD>
<TE>   Run from sophisticated war-fighting headquarters inside a
well-fortified, 262-acre military camp in the Qatari desert, the
weeklong war games underscore the new importance of this nation,
which has a population of 750,000 and is located about 650 miles
southeast of Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of the computer-assisted command drill, coupled with
separate, continuing live-fire exercises by the U.S. Army near the
Iraqi border in northern Kuwait, appeared to ratchet up the United
States' military pressure on Iraq as the two countries approach a
possible showdown over United Nations inspections for weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Internal Look itself involves no troop movements. It is designed
to test the U.S. military's ability to command, control and
communicate among all four U.S. armed services now deployed
throughout the Persian Gulf, the Middle East and Southwest and
Central Asia.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no moving troops, just moving electrons -- a lot of
electrons," said one Central Command officer here. "There is a whole
plethora of contingencies that CENTCOM has to plan for."</TE>
<TE>   Franks has made no public statements or appearances since he
landed here in the Qatari capital from his command headquarters in
Tampa, Fla., on Friday. He headed straight to the secretive military
base that houses the new mobile command post -- several dozen prefab
buildings and tents bristling with high-tech American gear.</TE>
<TE>   In opening Saturday's session, called the "Rock Drill," Franks
stressed the important roles of troop readiness, flexibility in
planning and leading-edge technology on the modern battlefield,
according to Jim Wilkinson, director of strategic communications for
Central Command. But military and political analysts stressed that
the symbolism of the exercise is not the what of it but the where.</TE>
<TE>   "Qatar's strategic importance extends well beyond this exercise,"
said an analysis published Friday by the Washington Institute for
Near East Policy, a think tank in the U.S. capital.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond Camp As Sayliyah, the U.S. Air Force has stationed more
than 3,000 personnel at Qatar's Al Udeid Air Base, 20 miles southwest
of Doha, which can accommodate scores of U.S. attack aircraft. Its
12,000-foot runway is the longest in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Qatar's progressive ruler, Sheik Hamad ibn Khalifa al Thani, has
sanctioned and encouraged America's growing military presence here.
It is part of an intensive campaign by the emir to use Qatar's
natural-gas wealth to modernize and safeguard the nation. He launched
the campaign after he overthrew his father in a bloodless 1995 coup.</TE>
<TE>   The emir also has presided over progressive social and religious
policies that have made Qatar a model of emerging democratic freedoms
in the Islamic world. It is home to the largely independent Al
Jazeera television network, which is revolutionizing mass
communications in the Arab world.</TE>
<TE>   But there are other forces at work behind the seemingly
pro-American stance in a nation that, Saturday's opening exercise
showed, could well house the brain trust of a future U.S. war on
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not pro-anybody. We are pro-ourselves," said Hassan M.
Saleh Ansari, director of the Gulf Studies Center at the University
of Qatar. "We believe that having a powerful friend is in our
interest, and we believe it is nothing to be ashamed of."</TE>
<TE>   The nation, he said, needs America's protection as it exploits one
of the world's largest natural gas reservoirs, in which U.S.
companies have invested about $50 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Those economic ties have been followed by cultural ones. Qatar is
spending hundreds of millions of dollars to develop a new "City of
Education" intended to have branch campuses of several U.S.
universities.</TE>
<TE>   And most recently, the country has given virtual carte blanche to
U.S. military forces in the strategic alliance that allowed Franks'
Central Command to base its new command facility here.</TE>
<TE>   "With a Gulf War looming, the importance of this cooperation
cannot be minimized," concluded the Washington Institute for Near
East Policy's analysis, titled "A Tale of Two Qatars." "But the
U.S.-Qatar alliance is murkier than it appears.</TE>
<TE>   "Qatar's policies are not so much 'pro-American' as they are
pragmatic steps to offset instability, compensate for weak defenses
and undercut Qatar's foes."</TE>
<TE>   Qataris are most wary of Saudi Arabia, their powerful neighbor.
The two nations have fought on and off for nearly 70 years over their
common border, and Qatar accused the Saudis of sponsoring an
unsuccessful countercoup a year after the younger Al Thani took
power.</TE>
<TE>   Qatar also has a history of admiration for and friendship with
leaders of the Al Qaeda terror network.</TE>
<TE>   A Qatari Cabinet minister and member of the ruling family played
host to senior Al Qaeda members in the years leading up to the Sept.
11 attacks; that minister reportedly has been stripped of his power.
And U.S. officials have grumbled about Al Jazeera's airing of
exclusive videotapes of Osama bin Laden since the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But the overwhelming majority of Qataris are fiercely loyal to
their emir, according to most analysts. And the emir has been
unequivocal in his support for the U.S. presence here -- and
President Bush's war on terror.</TE>
<TE>   The emir even bought television ad time to affirm that support --
commercials that promoted Qatar's backing of the U.S. counter-terror
campaign.</TE>

<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>About 15,000 people carrying candles protested across the street from
the U.S. Embassy here Saturday in the largest show of anti-American
sentiment in South Korea in years.</LD>
<LD>   The protesters, upset over a traffic accident in which a U.S. Army
vehicle killed two local schoolgirls, booed and chanted "President
Bush apologize!" and "Let's drive out the murderous American GIs!"</LD>
<LD>   The demonstrators -- including students and members of religious
and civic groups -- called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea. Protesters also want the soldiers involved
in the incident -- who were acquitted in U.S. courts-martial last
month -- tried under Korean law.</LD>
<TE>   About 9,000 police armed with helmets, batons and plastic shields
spread out in districts around the embassy. Police buses surrounded
the embassy compound.</TE>
<TE>   The traffic accident has become an issue in the Dec. 19
presidential elections, with all the main candidates endorsing the
activists' calls for an overhaul of the agreement governing U.S.
troops in South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   The presidential Blue House issued a statement stressing the need
for the 50-year-old U.S.-South Korean alliance, maintained to deter
aggression from communist North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition candidate Lee Hoi Chang, whose conservative party
champions traditional close ties to the U.S., said the alliance faced
a serious challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "My biggest concern is that this issue will spill over into
widespread calls for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea,
damaging the bilateral alliance that has been a pillar of our
country's security," Lee said while campaigning in Seoul.</TE>

<LD>Following are excerpts from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's speech
to the Kuwaiti people Saturday. The remarks were delivered in Arabic
by Iraq's information minister and translated by Associated Press.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "We are saying what we are saying not out of weakness or as a
tactic to an illegitimate end but to clarify facts as we see them....
On that basis, we apologize to God for any action that may anger the
Almighty if such an action took place in the past, unbeknownst to us
but considered to be our responsibility, and to you [Kuwaitis] we
apologize on this basis as well. O, you brothers, what we wish for is
what we are working to achieve for your brothers in Iraq: to live
free, without foreign control of your destiny, will, decisions,
wealth, present and future."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Our behavior was prompted by so many actions starting with the
joint military maneuvers in October 1989 in Kuwait under the auspices
of the Americans. Then Gen. [H. Norman] Schwarzkopf, in February
1990, said that there was a need to increase the American presence in
the Gulf area ... and then [Kuwait's] lowering the prices of crude
oil despite OPEC's warning.</TE>
<TE>   "For those and other reasons, it was clear to us that danger for
Iraq was in the offing and that it could not be solved through
political channels. Therefore, under the framework of self-protection
and protecting everything that is dear, the events of Aug. 2, 1990,
took place."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "As you can see, the foreigners are occupying your country ... and
as you know, when the foreigners occupy a country, they do not only
desecrate the soil but the soul, the religion and the mind."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "We and the people of Iraq salute those young believers who stand
up to the foreign occupier with arms and those who see or believe it
is a shame that requires the cleansing of the land, and of the
people, by fire and other means."</TE>

<HD>Two Van Gogh Paintings Stolen</HD>
<DH>Thieves take the early works, worth millions of dollars,
from a Dutch museum dedicated to the artist.</DH>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>AMSTERDAM</DL>
<LD>Thieves stole two Vincent van Gogh paintings worth millions of
dollars in a daring theft Saturday from an Amsterdam museum dedicated
to the tortured 19th century Dutch artist.</LD>
<LD>   Alarms went off at 8 a.m., two hours before the Van Gogh Museum
opened. By the time police got to the scene, the thieves had
vanished, museum director John Leighton said.</LD>
<LD>   Police found a 15-foot ladder leaning against the rear of the
building. The thieves had climbed to the second floor and broken a
window, police spokeswoman Elly Florax said.</LD>
<TE>   One missing painting was "View of the Sea at Scheveningen," a
small picture of a boat setting off into a stormy sea that was
painted in 1882. The thickly applied paint contains grains of sand
blown onto the canvas from the North Sea beach where Van Gogh worked.
It is one of his first major pieces.</TE>
<TE>   The second filched work was "Congregation Leaving the Reformed
Church in Nuenen," painted in 1884-85, which shows the village church
where Van Gogh's father served as pastor.</TE>
<TE>   "The 'Reform Church' was emotionally important. He probably meant
it as a souvenir for his mother," Leighton said.</TE>
<TE>   Van Gogh paintings were stolen from the same museum, in the heart
of the Dutch capital, in 1991. His most famous work, "Sunflowers,"
was among the works stolen then, but the masterpieces were later
recovered.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, masked gunmen snatched two Van Gogh paintings in Italy.
Those works were also later found.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, thieves stole diamond jewelry from a museum in the
Netherlands exhibiting tiaras and necklaces borrowed from European
royalty.</TE>

<HD>Rivals Go Forward Even as Venezuela Remains Paralyzed</HD>
<DH>President Chavez's supporters and foes both turn out for
their cause. Oil production plummets and fear of more violence grows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>The nation's deepening schism was plain to see on this capital's
broad avenues Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   In the poor city center, more than 100,000 backers rallied in
support of embattled President Hugo Chavez, flooding the narrow
streets around the presidential palace with a human sea. They danced.
They sang. And they donned bright red berets to celebrate the
election of the former paratrooper four years ago.</LD>
<LD>   On the upper-class east side, meanwhile, a smaller demonstration
of Chavez's opposition marched slowly along leafy thoroughfares. The
participants wore black. They walked in silence. And they mourned
three of their own killed at a protest Friday night.</LD>
<TE>   The two groups did not pass. They did not clash. But the country
seemed in a daze, paralyzed not only by a nationwide strike that
organizers threatened Saturday to extend for a seventh day but by
plummeting oil production and the fear of violence coiled in
ever-spreading rumors.</TE>
<TE>   "Chavez is driving them crazy! Chavez is driving them crazy!" the
crowd in the city's gritty center chanted gleefully.</TE>
<TE>   "Not one step back! Not one step back!" shouted the demonstrators
who later gathered at the scene of Friday's killings, an elegant
square that has become the center of opposition protests.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela's political crisis pits a large, disorganized coalition
of businesses, unions and politicians against Chavez, a fiery leftist
leader who has based his "revolution" on a promise to improve the lot
of the 80% of the people who live in poverty.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Chavez seemed to make no effort to assuage the
growing tensions. Wearing his military beret, the former lieutenant
colonel addressed his followers in an hours-long address in which he
accused his opponents of being "terrorists," "coup plotters" and
"conspirators."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez said the strike was similar to a coup against him in April,
when he was briefly ousted. He was restored to power 48 hours later
by faithful military units and supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our future: to fight and fight and fight," said Chavez,
himself one of the leaders of a failed coup in 1992. "We will
maintain our revolutionary battle, wherever it may take place!"</TE>
<TE>   Fears of violence were so great that the Venezuelan defense
minister and the joint chiefs of staff appeared on national
television to assure viewers that there was no risk of a coup by the
military.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Ambassador Charles Shapiro also repeatedly appeared on
television both Friday and Saturday to warn against future such
attempts. The U.S. was widely criticized for appearing to back the
coup in April.</TE>
<TE>   A political solution never seemed further away, though
representatives from both sides pledged to sit down at the
negotiating table Saturday night for the first time in a week.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition position seemed to have hardened since the attack
Friday. Previously, its goal was to convince Chavez to allow a
nonbinding referendum on his rule in February. Chavez insists no vote
is permitted by the constitution before August.</TE>
<TE>   But Saturday, some within the fragmented opposition insisted that
now, Chavez must resign and agree to early elections or face the
possibility of widespread civil disobedience.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition says the president's ill-defined revolution has
plunged the country into misery. Inflation has rocketed to 30%,
unemployment stands at 17%, and the economy has contracted by 7% this
year.</TE>
<TE>   The strike launched Monday gained force during the week with the
participation of the country's oil industry, the most important
sector in the economy. Oil revenue accounts for more than half the
country's budget.</TE>
<TE>   Striking administrators, ship captains and dockworkers have
brought exports to a near halt, with most refineries operating at
minimum levels. On Saturday, Venezuelan military forces took over an
oil tanker holding 280,000 barrels of gasoline that had been anchored
in Lake Maracaibo in western Venezuela by a rebel captain.</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, in an interview with foreign correspondents, Chavez
admitted for the first time that the oil strike was beginning to
affect production.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela is the United States' third-largest oil supplier,
sending 1.2 million barrels daily, or more than 10% of all America's
oil imports.</TE>
<TE>   "Some production has already been affected, and some oil fields
have been closed," said Chavez, who earlier denied the strike had
affected the economy. "If the strike continues, international clients
would of course be affected, but we are taking measures so that
doesn't happen."</TE>
<TE>   In the center of Caracas, the president's tone was more
pugnacious.</TE>
<TE>   "The country must rise up now and defend its petroleum industry,
which belongs to all men and women in Venezuela," he shouted to his
supporters.</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the city, those in Plaza Altamira focused on
mourning the dead, a 17-year-old girl, a 70-year-old woman and a
44-year-old man. Twenty-eight others were wounded Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrested at least seven people in connection with the
shooting, with one of the men, identified as Joao Goveia, a
Portuguese, accused of firing into the crowd.</TE>

<HD>A Bumper Crop of Bad Air in San Joaquin Valley</HD>
<DH>Growth brings more smog and health woes. Cleanup seems a
low priority for officials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Arax and Gary Polakovic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>FRESNO</DL>
<LD>The sun is setting on California's great valley, but the
brilliant light no longer shines as it used to. The mountains to the
east and west are gone too, blotted from the horizon by a sky the
color of mud.</LD>
<LD>   When the first settlers arrived here in the early 1800s, it was
the wildflowers of the San Joaquin Valley and the divine view of the
Sierra that set them to poetry. Today, this 300-mile-long stretch of
factory farms and sprawling suburbs is the worst place in America for
smog and one of the worst for haze.</LD>
<LD>   The state's big middle -- by the measure of smog throughout the
day -- has now overtaken Los Angeles as the nation's capital of bad
air.</LD>
<TE>   During the last 22 months, the San Joaquin Valley, boasting 3.4
million people and 2.4 million cars and pickups, has violated the
federal eight-hour ozone standard 226 days. The Los Angeles region,
with four times as many people and cars, has violated the same ozone
standard 201 days.</TE>
<TE>   This year the valley failed to achieve a single day of clean air
in June, July, August and October. During the last 12 months, the
"good air" standard has been reached only 53 days -- an average of
once a week.</TE>
<TE>   But a sky full of colorless ozone, the main ingredient in smog
that can sear and scar the lungs, is only half of what plagues this
region.</TE>
<TE>   Dust and soot, the same hazy particles that erase the Sierra and
alter the light, contribute to the deaths of an estimated 1,300
valley residents each year -- especially children, the elderly, the
poor and people already suffering from respiratory disease. That's
more deaths than from car accidents, murder and AIDS combined,
according to a 2002 study of state health figures by the
Environmental Working Group, an independent watchdog based in
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Even as people continue to move into the valley, some local
residents, fearing the health effects on their children, are packing
their bags.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent a year in the valley and decided it wasn't for me," said
Paul Kim, a radiologist who quit his job at a Fresno hospital this
summer and moved his wife and baby to Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't take long to figure out that the valley is run by
farmers and developers," he said. "The whole place is consumed with
building cheap tracts farther and farther out of town. When it comes
to the air, there's a collective complacency."</TE>
<TE>   The valley's lingering bad air stands in sharp contrast to what
has happened in other parts of the country. While Los Angeles, San
Diego and Denver have posted substantial gains in the campaign for
less polluted air, the flatland between Bakersfield and Stockton has
amassed the worst cleanup record in the West.</TE>
<TE>   The local air district and the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency have missed every federal deadline to improve the valley sky
since the district's formation in 1991. During that time, the
smog-forming emissions from cars, trucks, farms and oil refineries
have been cut by one-fourth. This modest improvement is far below the
requirements of the U.S. Clean Air Act and far short of what Los
Angeles and other regions have accomplished.</TE>
<TE>   The fight against haze has fared even worse. Over the last three
years, the amount of tiny particles in the sky has risen 17%, adding
more haze to a region that already ranks near the top on the EPA's
list of particulate pollution. The haze is a piercing mix of dust,
smoke and other airborne matter from farms, vehicles, home
construction and wood-burning stoves and fireplaces. The particles
are small enough to lodge deep in the lungs and can cause cancer,
asthma and heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   The year-round assault from smog and haze also includes a
considerable punch from pollen and pesticides.</TE>
<TE>   As a matter of topography, it would be hard for nature to design a
more perfect smog factory than this place, the nation's longest
valley, pinched by the Sierra and the Coast Range. An inversion layer
traps emissions beneath a broiling sun in summer and a stagnant fog
in winter.</TE>
<TE>   So adverse are the climate and terrain that it takes half as many
emissions in the valley to produce about the same levels of smog
found in the Los Angeles Basin.</TE>
<TE>   Poet Philip Levine, the only Fresnan other than William Saroyan to
win a Pulitzer Prize, now spends part of his year in Brooklyn to get
a dose of fresher air. "This past summer was the worst I've
experienced. I really had trouble breathing. As crazy as it sounds,
New York is a whole lot better for my lungs."</TE>
<TE>   At a graduation ceremony in June, the sixth-graders at Malloch
Elementary School in affluent northwest Fresno were asked who among
them used asthma inhalers. Parents and grandparents, who had gathered
in the cafeteria to celebrate, gasped when 30 of the 59 students
raised their hands. "I had no idea it was that high," Principal Ellen
Hedman said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 16% of the children in Fresno County have been diagnosed
with asthma. That is the highest rate in California and twice the
rate in Los Angeles County, according to a survey by the UCLA Center
for Health Policy Research. Indeed, every place in this region -- San
Joaquin, Stanislaus, Merced, Madera, Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Kern
counties -- has a rate higher than Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Krissy Riley, 13, who attends a kindergarten-through-eighth-grade
school, no longer hides her asthma inhaler from classmates.
"Embarrassed? Heaven's no," said her mother, Kathy Riley. "The
inhaler is a fact of life here. It's almost cool to have one. It's
right up there with a cell phone."</TE>
<TE>   No one needs to tell Tony Souza that his dairy in Kingsburg is
harsh on the lungs and bad public relations. Each late summer evening
as the sun sets, a curtain of dust drifts from the dairy to nearby
Highway 99. Passing drivers try turning off the flow of their air
conditioners, but there's no escape. What's floating in the air isn't
only dirt but dung. The manure cloud, kicked up by the hooves of
2,000 Holsteins, bakes in the hot sun.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be good neighbors, but it's not that easy," said
Souza, manager of Jensen Dairy. "We'd have to redesign our entire
dairy to cut down on the dust and gases. You're talking about $3
[million] or $4 million to fix it."</TE>
<TE>   If the rest of California has emerged as a world leader in the
fight for clean air, a laboratory for innovative solutions and tough
regulations, then smack in its middle lie eight counties and 24,000
square miles where the clean-air campaign is sadly broken.</TE>
<TE>   Not only does the valley lack a plan to achieve healthful air, it
has failed to cast the cleanup net as far and wide as Los Angeles
has. In Southern California, for instance, there are regulations on
idling big rigs and vehicle fleets, whereas the San Joaquin Valley
Air Pollution Control District has none.</TE>
<TE>   Cars, pickups, sport utility vehicles and big rigs remain this
region's biggest polluters. Over the last decade, new freeways and
suburbs to accommodate a growing population have increased the daily
miles traveled from 63 million to 83 million. On-road vehicles now
account for 40% of the smog here, state figures show.</TE>
<TE>   Agriculture, meanwhile, stands as the valley's biggest industrial
polluter and the biggest source of haze. Farming operations, which
include tilling and harvesting of cotton, grapes, tree fruit, almonds
and pistachios, account for 62% of particles in the air and 20% of
the smog.</TE>
<TE>   Emissions from dairies and feedlots -- the gases and dust that
help form smog and haze -- are growing 5% a year, state figures show.</TE>
<TE>   The fight to clean up the air has now fallen so far behind
schedule that the rest of the decade promises no real change.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you of a single political leader here who has taken
on air quality as an issue," said Cliff Garoupa, a Fresno City
College professor who serves on a committee to reduce vehicle trips
to and from campus. "They don't want to upset the building industry
and agriculture or mess with the sanctity of the automobile.</TE>
<TE>   "Here we are, the worst place in the nation, and the only solution
our politicians and air district can come up with is a pathetic list
of voluntary programs. 'Spare the Air' days, they call them. Talk
about fiddling while Rome burns."</TE>
<TE>   In October, for example, the county Board of Supervisors in Madera
voted to push forward a "new town" that will plant 6,500 houses on
farm fields 15 miles outside the city. At no time during the debate
did the supervisors delve into the project's impact on air quality.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Ronn Dominici, who cast the swing vote, regrets not
bringing up the issue. "I probably should have raised more
questions," said Dominici, who is also vice chairman of the valley
air district. "Enough attention isn't being directed at our bad air
by boards of supervisors and city councils."</TE>
<TE>   Elected officials point to the valley's deep poverty and 15%
unemployment as rationale for not imposing regulations that might
drive away industry. Farming throughout California, for instance, has
been largely exempt from state air pollution laws since 1947 and has
never had to answer to the U.S. Clean Air Act.</TE>
<TE>   The local air district has never challenged this exemption or
asked the EPA to regulate agriculture's biggest polluters. Nor has
the EPA stepped in to do it on its own.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't go to the San Joaquin Valley and not be impacted by the
conditions there," said Wayne Nastri, administrator for the EPA's
Pacific Southwest office. "We have a long way to go, and there hasn't
been much progress."</TE>
<TE>   By law, the valley should be cutting its daily emissions by a
third, or 300 tons. But even as the air district has reduced some
smog-forming emissions, new suburbs and freeways emit almost as many
new pollutants into the air.</TE>
<TE>   In the face of such growth, the daily discharge of noxious
substances is being reduced by a mere 23 tons.</TE>
<TE>   David Crow, the local air district's top administrator, said the
region has made progress, but not fast enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Our [air quality] has been improving over the past decade despite
a population increase of 500,000 people," he said. "The improvements
just aren't enough to meet the federal standards."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors on the front line of the asthma and allergy wars are
surprised to find patients who don't make the connection between what
ails them and the bad air. It got so frustrating that Fresno doctor
Malik Baz decided to do something bold when he built his
9,000-square-foot medical complex along Freeway 41 north of town:</TE>
<TE>   He equipped it with a tall tower that flashes each day's air
quality to commuters.</TE>
<TE>   All summer long, as the big electronic red letters shouted
"UNHEALTHY," the Baz Allergy and Asthma Center filled with people
wheezing and coughing and clutching steroid inhalers that had run
dry.</TE>
<TE>   "I had patients this summer who took their vacations on the coast
and told the same story," he said. "As soon as they got out of town,
their sinuses and lungs cleared up and they stopped taking their
medications. Then, as soon as they headed back and hit the valley
floor, they had to pull out their inhalers again."</TE>
<TE>   This summer, the San Joaquin Valley -- touted as the area that
will have more to say about the state's future than any other because
of wide open land and affordable housing -- became the first region
in the nation to seek the designation of "extreme noncompliance" with
federal law.</TE>
<TE>   By moving to the worst category, the valley would accept a stigma
in return for a reprieve: Federal officials will grant seven more
years for the valley to reach air-quality standards without
forfeiting $2.2 billion in highway funds and exposing the region to
$30 million in industry cleanup costs.</TE>
<TE>   The delay, some fear, will only play into the valley's impulse to
put off yet again making tough decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Dan McCorquodale, the retired state senator from San Jose who
wrote the law that established the valley air district in 1991, said
he feels like "a disappointed parent who's watched his child grow up
to accomplish nothing."</TE>
<TE>   "My worst fears have been realized," he said. "The air district
has sat on its hands, and the people haven't gotten their money's
worth."</TE>
<TE>   McCorquodale recalled that the counties had to be dragged "kicking
and screaming" to form one big air district back in 1991. Oilmen in
Bakersfield, farmers in Tulare, builders in Stockton, chamber of
commerce heads in Fresno -- no one wanted a regional agency that took
away local control.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers ended up passing the measure but on one condition: The
air district's board would be made up of only county supervisors and
city council members. Unlike in other regions of the state, the
valley's air board would have no voice from the fields of health,
education or science.</TE>
<TE>   "Our bill got pretty watered down at the end," McCorquodale said.
"By filling up the board with only elected officials, the cause of
clean air was lost right there. It guaranteed that the only voices
heard were those of industry and business."</TE>
<TE>   In 1991-92, shortly after the formation of the regional air
district, local neighborhood groups concerned about sprawling
suburban development urged the agency to impose a fee on new
construction.</TE>
<TE>   The idea behind the so-called "indirect source rule" was to make
sprawl offset its own impacts. By assessing a fee of $5,000 per
house, the air district could raise tens of millions of dollars to
clean the air. The money could fund everything from mass transit to
farmers converting their diesel irrigation pumps to cleaner-burning
fuel.</TE>
<TE>   But as soon as the idea was floated, records show, the letters of
protest poured in from state and local building groups. The head of
the Fresno-area Building Industry Assn. told residents they were
wasting their time supporting the measure. The fee would be killed,
he said, and it was.</TE>
<TE>   With few brakes on growth, the state's midsection has sprouted new
suburbs in every direction.</TE>
<TE>   In Fresno, Mike and Lisa Biskup have watched the city march north
all the way to the San Joaquin River, filling an area once reserved
as a greenbelt with 2,500 houses. The small farm where they raise
lambs, chickens, llamas and vegetables can now feel the breath of
suburbia.</TE>
<TE>   Their two sons, ages 4 and 2, have grown up hearing the sound of
heavy equipment tearing out nearby orchards and vineyards. Eli, their
oldest, knows the different functions of a backhoe, grader, roller
and trencher.</TE>
<TE>   But the Sierra outside his front door is a mystery veiled in
brown.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a perfect view of the mountains, but we haven't seen
them all summer," Mike Biskup said. "For the past five years, my wife
and I have been looking at the sky and saying, 'My gosh, we breathe
this stuff. This is so sick!' "</TE>
<TE>   Biskup, who works for an irrigation district, began wheezing at
night, and his cough lingered for months. His doctor diagnosed
asthma. His wife, Lisa, a schoolteacher, loves their little rural
patch, but the bad air has them looking elsewhere to raise their
boys.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a geographic fact that the valley can't sustain the
development they're talking about without destroying the air," she
said. "But they just want to keep doing what they're doing."</TE>
<TE>   Builders say that they aren't indifferent to the problem of air
pollution but that slowing growth is the wrong approach. The mantra
here should be "smart growth," said Jeff Harris, head of the Building
Industry Assn. of the San Joaquin Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as people continue to be born, we have a moral and
ethical obligation to put a roof over their heads," he said. "Now,
how you do that is the key. It doesn't mean drawing a line around our
cities with permanent greenbelts. It means higher densities and
building out in increments."</TE>
<TE>   It's not just people and their cars moving over the mountains and
settling into new tracts and befouling the air that are the problem.
More than 500,000 cows -- many of them refugees from Southern
California, where the dairy farm has given way to gated communities
-- have joined them in the past decade. That's one cow for every new
resident. The valley now boasts 2.8 million dairy and feedlot cows --
more than all the vehicles on its roads.</TE>
<TE>   Most dairymen have needed only to fill out a simple application
with the county to start up. The regulatory process was so lax that
in 1999 the state attorney general sued Tulare County, the nation's
No. 1 milk producer, and imposed a basic environmental review
requirement.</TE>
<TE>   The industrial dairies of the San Joaquin Valley bear little
resemblance to the bucolic California farms in TV ads, extolling
"Great Cheese Comes From Happy Cows." Thousands of cows squeeze in
and out of tight concrete stalls, kicking up dust on manure-laden
running paths.</TE>
<TE>   Emissions from dairies and feedlots will become the largest source
of smog-forming gases in the next three years, according to air
district projections. The California Air Resources Board estimates
that dairies also account for 44% of valley air's ammonia, which
contributes to particle pollution.</TE>
<TE>   "There is ammonia coming off these diaries, and it's probably a
significant amount," said J.P. Cativiela, a spokesman for dairy
industry groups. "[But] the 44% figure comes from a study of just one
dairy over a few days.</TE>
<TE>   "We're willing to do our part, but we need more research before
they start imposing new regulations."</TE>
<TE>   This same argument can be heard from fruit, nut and vegetable
farmers, as well as cotton and grain growers, who form the backbone
of California's $27-billion-a-year agriculture industry.</TE>
<TE>   They don't dispute that pesticides and fertilizers release more
hydrocarbons than the valley's petroleum industry. Or that thousands
of acres of almond trees, the valley's new boom crop, create great
dust clouds during harvest. They even concede a link between the fall
spraying of cotton fields and what people here refer to as "defoliant
colds."</TE>
<TE>   But many of the farmers say that they are barely hanging on in the
face of global competition and that any clean air measures adding to
their costs could drive them out of business. Like dairymen, cotton
and grape growers believe that more studies are needed to identify
agriculture's exact role in air pollution and what solutions should
be undertaken. A $30-million particulate study backed by farm groups
has been gathering data since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had some problems with some of the more recent samples, and
we're still working to complete the study," said Manual Cunha of the
Nisei Farmers League. "We know farming is part of the problem, but
without that science we can only do so much."</TE>
<TE>   A state program that pays farmers to convert their diesel
irrigation pumps to cleaner fuel has slashed emissions from farm
equipment by nearly a third. But farmers have resisted proposals to
do more.</TE>
<TE>   Last March, the California air board announced a statewide cleanup
plan that outlined new restrictions on livestock waste and irrigation
pumps and raised the possibility of "no spray" pesticide days. Farm
groups reacted so negatively that Gov. Gray Davis' staff moved
quickly to scuttle the plan. Winston Hickox, head of the state EPA,
said the no-spray idea was "dead on arrival." The rest of the plan
was also shelved.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Hall, a local Sierra Club member, is no stranger to the
farmer's viewpoint or power. Before becoming a clean air activist,
Hall spent 13 years editing California farm journals and organizing
farm equipment shows.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been the same song for 12 years. 'We need better science. We
need more money to fund more studies.' It's one delay tactic after
another," Hall said. "Their end game is pretty simple. Avoid federal
regulations at all costs."</TE>
<TE>   Hall brought in EarthJustice, the San Francisco-based
environmental defense fund, to file a series of lawsuits. Citing a
pattern of neglect and inaction, EarthJustice challenged, among other
things, the state's exemption on agriculture and the failure of the
federal EPA and air district to oppose this free pass. In May, the
EPA settled one of the lawsuits by agreeing to seek an end to the
farm exemption, though it's likely to be years before farms will be
required to change their practices.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Sant'Agata, executive director of the American Lung Assn. in
Fresno, senses a shift in public awareness. The air district, for
instance, may soon ban winter fireplace use on bad air days, and it
has pledged to reconsider the idea of a fee on builders.</TE>
<TE>   "Public sentiment is changing," Sant'Agata said. "People are
starting to open their eyes. Now we have to get the politicians
aboard."</TE>
<TE>   That may not be such an easy thing.</TE>
<TE>   In April, a poll by the Public Policy Institute of California
ranked air pollution as the No. 1 concern of valley residents, with
sprawl not far behind. Yet two prominent state legislators -- Sen.
Dean Florez (D-Shafter) and Assemblywoman Sarah Reyes (D-Fresno) --
have never made cleaning up the air an issue.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not touched on that issue yet," said Reyes' press
secretary, Karen Clifton.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, state Sen. Roy Ashburn (R-Bakersfield), then an
assemblyman, did take a stand when the Bakersfield Californian
interviewed him for an in-depth report on air quality. He told the
newspaper he was too busy dealing with other state issues to concern
himself with improving the air.</TE>
<TE>   This September, even as local schools canceled Friday football
games for the first time because of bad air, local officials took the
following actions:</TE>
<TE>   * The Tulare County Board of Supervisors approved a new dairy with
14,000 Holsteins.</TE>
<TE>   * The Council of Fresno County Governments urged voters to pass a
tax to fund $1.3 billion in new highways.</TE>
<TE>   * The air district allowed farmers to conduct open-field burning
of more than 6 million tons of paper and plastic trays used to make
raisins.</TE>
<TE>   * The city councils in Fresno, Clovis, Visalia and Tulare pushed
ahead plans for more housing tracts and more strip malls -- without
studying impacts on traffic and air.</TE>
<TE>   "There's such a pressure to expedite these projects that no one in
the planning departments is asking hard questions about traffic
congestion and how it impacts air quality," said Moses Stites, an
assistant planner for the California Department of Transportation in
Fresno. "It's business as usual."</TE>
<TE>   At the Biskup farm on the northern edge of the city, a "For Sale"
sign now marks the frontyard. As soon as their third child is born in
January, Mike and Lisa Biskup, lifelong Fresnans, are moving -- to
the Olympic Peninsula in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "I love my job, and I love this farm," he said. "But I can't put
my kids in harm's way anymore. We're 10 years away from breathing
even marginally better air."</TE>

<HD>Officers Linked to Death of Teen</HD>
<DH>LAPD patrolmen failed to report dropping off a gang member
near rivals' turf shortly before he was killed, D.A.'s report states.
Prosecution ruled out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Matt Lait and Scott Glover</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Los Angeles police officers sought to cover up their contact with
a 16-year-old gang member who was shot to death on the border of a
rival gang's territory just minutes after the officers released him
from their patrol car, according to a district attorney's review of
the case.</LD>
<LD>   Neither officer, one of whom was accused of dropping off the same
youth in rival gang territory as punishment a month earlier,
documented the encounter with the victim on the day he was killed.</LD>
<LD>   "It appears, based on this investigation, that [the officers]
intentionally withheld information from the homicide detectives,
internal affairs investigators and their chain of command," wrote
Deputy Dist. Atty. Laura L. Laesecke, who investigated the officers
as part of the Rampart scandal. "Not only does their lie obstruct
justice, but it also calls into question the veracity of the rest of
their ... statements" about the case.</LD>
<TE>   Ultimately, Laesecke concluded that the officers could not be
prosecuted for obstructing justice because the best evidence against
them came from so-called compelled statements in which they were
ordered to cooperate with authorities or face termination from the
Los Angeles Police Department. Such statements cannot be used in
court against those who made them.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Laesecke wrote, the statute of limitations on such a
charge had expired. Both officers, Mario Rios and Michael Montoya,
deny any wrongdoing and remain on the job.</TE>
<TE>   Montoya, now assigned to the community relations office in
Northeast Division, seemed resigned to the criticism he and other
officers have faced in the wake of the Rampart scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the first bad thing that's been said about me.
They're not true," Montoya said in a recent interview. "But what can
be done about it?"</TE>
<TE>   Montoya and Rios, now assigned to Southeast Division, were charged
administratively by LAPD officials with making false statements about
the case during an internal affairs investigation.</TE>
<TE>   They were cleared of wrongdoing after they presented a declaration
from a retired homicide detective who said he recalled Montoya
mentioning that he knew the victim as a police informant, but did not
remember whether the officer acknowledged having any contact with him
on the day he was killed.</TE>
<TE>   The detective refused to testify at the officers' hearing. In a
recent interview with The Times, he declined to comment at length,
saying only that he could not recall what the officers told him about
their interaction with Eric Vega, known on the streets as "Baby
Happy."</TE>
<TE>   The incident, which was documented along with more than 80 other
cases recently rejected for prosecution by the district attorney,
came to light as part of the investigation into the Rampart scandal,
launched in 1999 following the admissions and allegations of corrupt
ex-cop Rafael Perez.</TE>
<TE>   The Vega case itself, however, was never mentioned by Perez.
Instead, investigators came upon it as they looked into allegations
of officer misconduct in another Rampart case.</TE>
<TE>   According to police reports, Montoya and Rios were working an
"observation post" in the 1200 block of South Lake Street on Nov. 5,
1996, looking for suspicious gang or drug activity, when they spotted
Eva Garcia dealing drugs. Based on their observations, other officers
from the Rampart anti-gang CRASH unit swooped in and arrested her.</TE>
<TE>   What the police reports do not state -- and what officers admitted
years later during compelled interviews with detectives -- was that
while Garcia was being arrested, Vega also was handcuffed and put in
the back of Montoya and Rios' squad car.</TE>
<TE>   The officers said later that Vega was not arrested but actually
was a police informant who wanted to pass on information to them. He
was handcuffed, the officers said, only so that his fellow gang
members would not become suspicious of his cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   After a few minutes of driving around with Vega in the car, the
officers said, they concluded that Vega did not have any significant
information and asked him where he wanted to be dropped off. Vega,
they said, asked to be let out near a gang hangout known as El
Castillo, where his mother was staying. The officers said they
dropped him off there.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, at 4:39 p.m., Montoya and Rios received a radio
call about a shooting. Within a minute, they were at the scene -- the
first officers to arrive. The victim, they discovered, was Vega.</TE>
<TE>   The killing occurred on the border of a rival gang's territory and
was a couple of blocks from where the officers allegedly released
Vega. Witnesses later implicated a rival gang member in the killing,
but no arrests have been made.</TE>
<TE>   Montoya said he told a sergeant and the lead homicide detective
that night about their contact with the shooting victim. Like the
detective, the sergeant said in a recent interview that he had no
recollection of any such conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Unaware of Vega's death, his mother and girlfriend went to South
Lake Street looking for him about 6 p.m. that day. A neighborhood
resident told them Vega had been arrested. They then went to the
Rampart station, but were told there was no record of his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   The next day Vega's mother went to Juvenile Hall to find her son,
but there was no record of him being there either. When she returned
home, she later told police, she learned that her son had been killed
shortly after he was taken away by officers the previous day.</TE>
<TE>   Suspicious of the timing, Vega's mother and his girlfriend
returned to the police station and claimed that officers were somehow
connected to the youth's death. It was at that point that Vega's
girlfriend also said she was with her boyfriend about a month earlier
when Rios and another officer put Vega in the back of their squad car
and drove off.</TE>
<TE>   She said she saw her boyfriend about two hours later, his shirt
torn and a frightened look on his face. She said Vega told her the
officers gave him a choice: get dropped off in territory of the Mara
Salvatrucha gang or the Rockwood gang, both rivals of his 18th Street
gang. He said he chose Rockwood.</TE>
<TE>   After Vega got out of the car, he allegedly said, the officers
shouted to two of his rivals that Vega was from 18th Street. He told
his girlfriend that the gang members chased him and managed to rip
his shirt but did not catch him.</TE>
<TE>   In her analysis of the events surrounding Vega's murder,
prosecutor Laesecke raised a series of questions about the officers'
accounts.</TE>
<TE>   If they dropped off Vega at El Castillo, where his mother was, why
did he then walk from there toward Pico Boulevard, a well-known
border between his gang's territory and that of a rival? And how was
it that he found himself in a life-threatening struggle "within five
minutes" of being dropped off by the police?</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor also noted that the two officers did not document
their contact with Vega in any of the reports they generated that
day, a violation of department policy. "Montoya and Rios completed
their [daily report], Eva Garcia's arrest report and their report as
first officers on the murder scene after Vega was killed and,
therefore, were aware at the time the reports were written of the
significance of their contact with him," she wrote. "Nevertheless,
they omitted his name and any reference to any contact with him from
each of those reports."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the prosecutor was skeptical of the officers' claim that
they told a supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, Laesecke noted, there is no mention of the
officers' contact with Vega in the homicide report prepared by Det.
John Curiel. And on the day after Vega's killing, in a tape-recorded
interview with the victim's girlfriend, Curiel can be heard asking
the young woman for basic information, such as the location of the
arrest, a description of the officers involved and the reason for the
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "If [Curiel] was already aware of Montoya's and Rios' involvement,
it seems logical that he would have also asked Garcia some questions
based on the information given to him by the officers or at least
tried to reassure her that the officers were not involved in Vega's
death," she continued.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Wigodsky, an alternate public defender who has been
specializing in Rampart cases, said the officers' conduct described
in the district attorney's memo is "outrageous." He noted that most
of the officers interviewed during the investigation had very little
recollection of the incident. "That's a telltale sign," he said. "You
know something fishy happened when they can't remember anything."</TE>

<HD>Mormon Scientist, Church Clash Over DNA Test</HD>
<DH>Anthropologist may be ousted for questioning teachings
about Native American ancestry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Lobdell and Larry B. Stammer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anthropologist Thomas W. Murphy set out to test a key principle of
his Mormon faith with the latest technology.</LD>
<LD>   He wondered: Would DNA analysis show -- as taught by the Book of
Mormon -- that many American Indians are descended from ancient
Israelites?</LD>
<LD>   His finding: negative.</LD>
<TE>   The result: excommunication -- if a church disciplinary panel
today finds him guilty of apostasy.</TE>
<TE>   The sacred writings of many faiths make claims that might not
stand up to scientific tests. But most faiths avoid conflict with
scholarship either because their claims relate to events too far in
the past to be tested or because they have reinterpreted their
scriptural claims as metaphors, rather than assertions of literal
fact.</TE>
<TE>   For devout Mormons, however, neither of those defenses is
available. The Book of Mormon, made public by Joseph Smith in 1830,
is a cornerstone of church doctrine and is taken literally by the
faithful. It teaches, among other things, that many American Indians
are descendants of ancient Israelites who came to this continent 600
years before Christ -- a time period within the reach of modern
archeology and genetics.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of that assertion and others, the church hierarchy has
repeatedly warred with historians, anthropologists and others who
have questioned its doctrines. Murphy appears to be the first member
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to face expulsion
for genetic research.</TE>
<TE>   His case marks "the first biological challenge" of Mormon
scripture, said Michael Whiting, an authority on DNA and an assistant
professor at church-affiliated Brigham Young University.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy's supporters, who include other dissident Mormons, hail
him. "Tom Murphy is the Galileo for Mormons," said Maxine Hanks, a
former Mormon excommunicated in 1993 for her feminist writings.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say they plan a series of candlelight vigils tonight in
U.S. cities, including one outside the Mormon temple in Salt Lake
City.</TE>
<TE>   But Whiting, for one, rejects any comparison to Galileo, who was
condemned by the Roman Catholic Church in 1633 for correctly claiming
that the Earth orbits the sun.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an inappropriate comparison," Whiting said. "The difference
is Galileo got the science right. I don't think Murphy has."</TE>
<TE>   Church leaders declined to comment on the specifics of Murphy's
case.</TE>
<TE>   "Matters of church discipline are handled on a confidential basis
between church members and their local leaders," said church
spokesman Dale Bills in Salt Lake City. "Local church leaders
determine what, if any, disciplinary action is appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy, chairman of the anthropology department at Edmonds
Community College in Lynnwood, Wash., and other scientists say that
DNA research demonstrates what anthropologists have long said: The
ancestors of the American Indians came across the Bering Sea from
Asia, with no traces of Middle Eastern ancestry.</TE>
<TE>   Those findings echo the work of other secular scholars who have
yet to uncover evidence, DNA, archeological or otherwise, of an
ancient Hebrew tribe that lived in America.</TE>
<TE>   To reach his conclusion, Murphy, 35, analyzed data collected by a
multimillion-dollar "molecular genealogy" project at Brigham Young as
well as other, similar projects that track ancestry from people
worldwide via DNA in blood samples.</TE>
<TE>   Scholars more closely aligned with the Mormon church than Murphy
argue that the lack of genetic evidence of an ancient Hebrew tribe in
America does not undermine the Book of Mormon, which also includes
what the book asserts is an eyewitness account of the ministry of
Jesus Christ on the American continent following his resurrection in
Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea that America may have been overwhelmingly peopled by
folks from northeastern Asia is perfectly compatible" with Mormon
doctrine, said Daniel Peterson, a lifelong Mormon and professor of
Asian and Near Eastern Languages at Brigham Young. Genetic evidence
that some Native American ancestors came from the Middle East could
easily be lost over thousands of years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy disagrees, pointing to examples of other groups of people
where genetic evidence can be found of ancient influences by foreign
populations.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy published his findings last year on a Web site run by
Mormon intellectuals who openly debate the historical accuracy of the
Book of Mormon. His work then appeared in American Apocrypha, an
anthology about the Book of Mormon published in May by Signature
Books, a small academic press in Salt Lake City that often releases
books critical of church doctrine.</TE>
<TE>   His conclusion is that "the Book of Mormon is a piece of 19th
century fiction," said Murphy, a lifelong Mormon who calls himself a
Latter-day skeptic. "And that means that we have to acknowledge
sometimes Joseph Smith lied."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Murphy says, he and other like-minded Mormon
skeptics agree that "the book might be fiction, but inspired as
well."</TE>
<TE>   "We can use science and history to understand the Book of Mormon
to an extent and show it's a 19th century document, but nothing can
tell us if it's divinely inspired," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In many Christian and Jewish congregations, that approach to
scripture would be routine.</TE>
<TE>   While both religious traditions have branches that believe in the
literal truth of the Bible, they also have adherents who see the
texts as divinely inspired, but not historically accurate.</TE>
<TE>   But the Mormon church, a religion that is relatively young, has
never considered that sort of nonliteral reading of its holy books
acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, there's no such thing as a loyal opposition," said
Kathy Worthington, a Salt Lake City resident and church critic. "They
say, 'When the prophet speaks, the thinking has been done.' They
honestly believe people in the church shouldn't discuss and dissent."</TE>
<TE>   The church, said Hanks, "just doesn't know what to do with any of
the factions outside its orthodoxy."</TE>
<TE>   Church critics say they fear that the prospect of Murphy's
excommunication will have a chilling effect on other Mormon scholars
who want to stay in the church.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy acknowledges that his position means "the odds for staying
in the church are overwhelming arrayed against me."</TE>
<TE>   "The Mormon faith is going to survive one way or another," he
said, but the important question is how it will handle new,
scientific evidence. "The Catholic Church survived Galileo, but they
first had to admit they were wrong."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- When President Bush unceremoniously dumped his top two
economic advisors Friday, few Washington insiders were surprised by
the decision. What they did find questionable, though, was the way
the two were let go.</LD>
<LD>   There were no leaks to the media. Rumors had wafted about for
weeks, largely because of growing dissatisfaction with the state of
the economy. But as with other big decisions, the Bush administration
kept this one under wraps. Not a single media outlet got wind of the
dismissals until a White House announcement Friday morning.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, the two advisors -- Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill
and National Economic Council Director Lawrence B. Lindsey -- were
given short notice. And throughout the day, the White House publicly
insisted that the resignations were voluntary, even as sources
revealed otherwise.</LD>
<TE>   As the O'Neill and Lindsey departures illustrated, the Bush White
House is the most disciplined in decades, with aides and officials
rarely talking out of school or straying from the official line.</TE>
<TE>   On one hand, some see that as a positive, demonstrating loyalty to
the president and an esprit de corps unusual for Washington. But
others criticize it as secretive, and caution that it can backfire on
the administration.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the White House appears to have been so concerned
that the news about O'Neill and Lindsey not leak that they announced
the dismissals before they had picked a new team or unveiled new
economic initiatives. The result is that instead of focusing on a new
policy direction, media stories focused on the failure of the
president's old one.</TE>
<TE>   "For a White House that's pretty good at controlling the
day-to-day message from the bully pulpit, they dropped the ball on
this one," said Leon E. Panetta, who served as chief of staff to
former President Clinton. "It's obvious that the president has made
that kind of discipline an important issue in the White House. But at
the same time, you can't be so absorbed with trying to avoid leaks
that it impacts on the policy of the president."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush team's cohesion manifests itself in myriad ways, both
professional and personal. Every Cabinet meeting, for instance, opens
with a prayer, led by a Cabinet secretary. Cabinet members meet
regularly over breakfast or lunch to socialize as well as conduct
business.</TE>
<TE>   Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman gets together so frequently
with Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton and Environmental Protection
Agency Administrator Christie Whitman that some administration
officials refer to them as "the three chicks."</TE>
<TE>   Spouses of those with jobs in the White House West Wing have
formed a support group to help with household chores and child care
and to offer companionship.</TE>
<TE>   "This group feels like a family," Veneman said. "The president has
set a very strong tone of working together. But it's also caring
about each other. We're probably an unusually cohesive group."</TE>
<TE>   Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said another reason that there
have been few leaks from within the administration is that Bush
allows Cabinet heads to fully air their views in the Oval Office.</TE>
<TE>   "We are given ample chance to express ourselves," Abraham said.
"And if you have that chance, that's one reason you don't have a lot
of leaking, and backbiting."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, as the fates of O'Neill and Lindsey made abundantly clear,
personal loyalty has its limits when it comes to the political career
of the president.</TE>
<TE>   "This administration is dedicated to the proposition that Bush II
should not be like Bush I," said University of Virginia political
analyst Larry Sabato.</TE>
<TE>   The current administration, he said, is determined to avoid the
perception of being insufficiently concerned about a weak economy, a
perception that crippled the administration of Bush's father.</TE>
<TE>   Presidential historian Bruce Buchanan of the University of Texas
in Austin said that as governor, Bush rarely if ever dismissed anyone
from his staff. He surmised that Bush by nature was loath to fire
O'Neill and Lindsey, but acceded to political imperatives.</TE>
<TE>   "Loyalty is a code in the family. And that code is one of the ways
that Bush sustains control over leaks, that makes his administration
unusual," Buchanan added.</TE>
<TE>   Still, to some extent the appearance of cohesion is just that --
an appearance. Since summer, the departments of State and Defense
have engaged in a tug of war over Iraq policy that has worked its way
into headlines.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has pressed to exhaust
diplomatic means for disarming Iraq before resorting to force.
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has expressed skepticism of the
U.N. weapons inspections process and is keen to launch a military
operation sooner rather than later. For the moment, Powell is holding
sway.</TE>
<TE>   "This administration is viewed as trying to hold very tight reins,
but the reality is that there is a lot of conflict out there,"
Panetta said.</TE>
<TE>   Leaks during the Clinton administration tended to be on domestic
policy, he noted. But in this administration, "there have been a lot
of leaks from the Pentagon. It's ... a lot more important that your
foreign policy team speaks with one voice."</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the Bush administration's closeness is that -- like
the rest of the country -- its officials pulled together after last
year's terrorist attacks. But with complicated policy debates
underway over Iraq and the economy, that cohesion was bound to fray.</TE>
<TE>   It seems clear that such policy disputes played a central role in
Friday's dismissals. O'Neill had apparent trouble toeing the party
line on tax cuts, expressing concern about what the damage the
decline in revenues was doing to the budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   David Gergen, a longtime Washington insider who has advised four
presidents, said the Bush team "on the whole and by Washington
standards has been one of the most disciplined administrations in
years."</TE>
<TE>   But, Gergen added: "Cohesion is easier to maintain when times are
good."</TE>

<HD>Delay-Plagued Shuttle Mission Ends as Endeavour Comes Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Space shuttle Endeavour, days late and low on life support, finally
made it home Saturday, landing safely at Kennedy Space Center.</LD>
<LD>   The shuttle landed at 2:37 p.m. after a three-day delay, the
longest in the 21-year history of the space shuttle program.</LD>
<LD>   The postponement was caused by a cold front across the eastern
United States. The front brought a major snowstorm to much of the
Southeast, Northeast and the Middle Atlantic states, and knocked out
power to more than 1 million homes.</LD>
<TE>   In Florida, the story was high winds, rain and storm clouds since
Wednesday, Endeavour's original landing date.</TE>
<TE>   Weather continued a cat-and-mouse game with Mission Control until
the final moments before the shuttle commander, Navy Capt. James
Wetherbee, fired the reentry rockets.</TE>
<TE>   Thick cloud cover over Cape Canaveral had receded, but as
Wetherbee steered the 100-ton orbiter toward its 3-mile-long landing
strip, he fought crosswinds right at the allowable limit of 17 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Although the shuttle had enough fuel for three landing attempts
Saturday and two Sunday, life support for the crew would have run out
sometime after the second attempt Sunday, NASA said.</TE>
<TE>   Seven astronauts were aboard the shuttle, three of them a
returning crew who spent more than six months on the international
space station.</TE>
<TE>   The others launched 15 days ago, delivered a new crew to the space
station and added a 14-ton girder to the orbiting science lab. They
left the station Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The crew had little to do since Wednesday except repeat the
exercise of donning spacesuits and preparing to fire Endeavour's
reentry rockets, only to have the "stand down" order come each time.</TE>
<TE>   Pickup games of "Jeopardy" with Mission Control helped keep them
amused, and for a wake-up call Saturday, ground controllers played
"I'll Be Home for Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   The crew even joked that if they could not land on Earth, they
might look elsewhere. "We've polled the crew and we're 'go' for the
moon," said astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria, who made three
spacewalks during the mission.</TE>
<TE>   NASA always tries to land shuttles at their home base in Florida.
Landing at an alternate site in California can delay that orbiter's
next launch and costs $900,000 to fly it 3,000 miles cross-country
atop a Boeing 747.</TE>
<TE>   NASA had a battery of tests awaiting the returning space station
crew -- American Peggy Whitson and Russians Valery Korzun and Sergei
Treschyov. They have been weightless for 185 days, and scientists
want to study them before they readapt to gravity.</TE>
<TE>   Endeavour's Nov. 23 launch was also late. A series of
difficulties, including bad weather and mechanical failures, put it
six weeks behind schedule.</TE>

<HD>New Breed of Patriots Speaking Up</HD>
<DH>Grass-roots efforts to rein in the anti-terrorist USA
Patriot Act gain support. Eugene, Ore., and other cities formally
oppose aspects of law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Martelle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EUGENE, Ore</DL>
<LD>EUGENE, Ore. -- Hope Marston keeps the seeds of revolution in four
plastic crates stacked on the planked floor of her overcrowded
bungalow here at the southern edge of this left-leaning college town.</LD>
<LD>   There are pamphlets and petitions, news stories and political
analyses, all part of Marston's battle against what she sees as the
excesses of the USA Patriot Act, a sweeping federal law enacted after
last year's terrorist attacks that broadens the government's ability
to use secret searches, wiretaps and other covert surveillance
techniques in the pursuit of terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   While the law's defenders say average citizens have nothing to
fear, civil libertarians like Marston believe the law opens the door
for government agents to resume the kind of domestic spying that
flourished under J. Edgar Hoover, when affiliation with radical ideas
was enough to get someone a place in the FBI's secret files.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't know how many people have had their homes searched, or
their library or bookstore records checked," said Marston, a
part-time secretary who launched the Eugene campaign after reading
about similar efforts elsewhere. "People were amazed that there was
something they could do locally."</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure from a campaign that drew together liberals and
Libertarians, Democrats and even a few Republicans, the Eugene City
Council recently joined a growing list of local governments calling
for a full or partial repeal of the Patriot Act, part of a nascent
nationwide effort organizers hope will persuade Congress to undo the
law.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, city councils in Sebastopol, about 50 miles north of
San Francisco, and Burlington, Vt., joined with their own
resolutions, and activists are busy in Pasadena, Santa Barbara and at
least eight other California communities.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign began in November 2001 in Northampton, Mass.,
although the first cities to pass resolutions were Ann Arbor, Mich.,
and Denver, said Nancy Talanian, one of the Massachusetts organizers.
So far, 17 cities have passed resolutions, and campaigns are underway
in at least 50 cities in 25 states.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers hope that by marshaling the voices of locally elected
officials, they can better pressure Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "Resolutions passed by elected local leaders carry a lot more
weight than letters from individual citizens," Talanian said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the resolutions are largely symbolic, as local governments
have no authority over federal laws or issues. The campaign echoes
the grass-roots efforts of a generation ago in which local groups
lobbied cities to declare themselves nuclear-free zones, a largely
symbolic show of hands of those opposing the development, use,
transport and storage of nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important aspect is to build a national consortium, a
groundswell, and by making these somewhat symbolic resolutions cities
are taking a stand," said Brian Michaels, a Eugene attorney who
helped draft the local resolution. "You do what you can to slow these
things down."</TE>
<TE>   The resolutions differ from place to place, each tailored to local
political concerns. But most call for the federal government to
reveal what local acts they've taken under the USA Patriot Act, and
demand that Congress either repeal the law or revoke some of its
elements allowing domestic spying.</TE>
<TE>   In Eugene, home to the University of Oregon and a cross-section of
liberal political groups, the City Council added its own spin by
ordering no city resources -- people or money -- be used to assist in
"unconstitutional activities."</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear whether that means Eugene police will reject requests
for help by federal agents, though the department was one of several
last year that refused to cooperate with a federal sweep of 5,000 men
of Middle Eastern descent.</TE>
<TE>   Since the unanimous vote, City Council members have fielded
e-mails and phone calls from people -- mostly from outside Eugene --
deriding the decision as unpatriotic.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them said, 'Now we know where Al Qaeda is hiding: in the
City Hall,' " said Councilwoman Betty Taylor, who introduced the
measure. "But then we got some that said we made them proud to be
American."</TE>
<TE>   Marston said she was pleased by the breadth of the campaign's
support locally.</TE>
<TE>   "They are people who want to defend freedom, and it crossed the
political spectrum," Marston said. "We have people who are way on the
right saying we want to catch bad guys, too, but we don't want to be
spied on in the process."</TE>
<TE>   The pivotal vote on the eight-member council came from Gary Pape,
a self-described pro-business, conservative Republican whose support
set the stage for the City Council's unanimous vote. Pape said he
took little notice when Congress passed the Patriot Act but became
troubled by some of its elements after Marston's group began lobbying
for the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "It's overly broad, overbearing and overly intrusive," said Pape,
adding that he had not read the entire 342-page act -- and doubts
that many federal legislators did either. "I've reviewed parts of it
that deserve some real scrutiny.... Parts of it need to get into
court, where they are more skilled and adept at constitutional issues
than city councils."</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the challenge are elements of the USA Patriot Act
that grant federal investigators wide latitude in "foreign
intelligence surveillance."</TE>
<TE>   That authority was backed last month by the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Court of Review, which overturned a ruling that Atty.
Gen. John Ashcroft was using the Patriot Act to improperly broaden
the FBI's spying abilities.</TE>
<TE>   Under the act, federal investigators can secretly enter homes,
plant wiretaps, search computers and take other investigative steps
if they believe someone is connected with foreign terrorists. The act
also makes it illegal for anyone who has been served a warrant under
the act -- such as bookstore owners or librarians -- from talking
about it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad I live in a city where we have spoken up against it,"
said Jeremy Nissel, co-owner with his wife of J. Michaels Books in
downtown Eugene. "It's a bad law."</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Linda Ellis, described the local vote as "an act of
courage," and disputed that it could be viewed as unpatriotic.</TE>
<TE>   "There are as many flags on cars in Eugene as there are in New
York City or Downey," Ellis said, adding that post-attack emotions
might have clouded Congress' judgment. "We feel like we have to
rubber-stamp everything because of the things that happened in New
York City and internationally. And I think that's a very dangerous
thing."</TE>

<HD>Firefighting Planes Are Grounded</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOISE, Idaho</DL>
<LD>The Forest Service has permanently grounded 11 air tankers and
temporarily grounded other planes used to fight wildfires after an
expert panel said the aerial firefighting program is unsafe and
plagued with problems.</LD>
<LD>   The panel's report released Friday was prompted by the deaths of
six fire crew members in two tanker crashes and a helicopter crash
earlier this year.</LD>
<LD>   The permanently grounded planes carry too high a risk to use, said
Forest Service Fire Director Jerry Williams, and a long-term solution
could mean building planes specifically for fighting wildfires, at a
cost of $20 million each.</LD>
<TE>   The grounded tankers were all C-130A or PB4Y-2 models used under
contract with private companies. They delivered about 10% of the
water and foam dropped on wildfires.</TE>
<TE>   Nineteen government-owned P-58 lead planes and four Sherpa
Smokejumper aircraft were grounded pending evaluation of safety
issues identified in the experts' report.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining 33 air tankers must pass a rigorous inspection and
follow a new maintenance program before they are returned to duty,
Williams said. Those air tankers are government-owned or -leased or
have structural differences from the grounded planes.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to reduce public and employee exposure to what we
perceive as high-risk aircraft," Williams said. "The contractors did
not identify structural problems."</TE>
<TE>   During next year's fire season, more helicopters could be used and
military planes may be called in if the fleet runs short, Williams
said.</TE>
<TE>   The expert panel, appointed by the federal government, found the
aerial firefighting program had a pass-the-buck approach to safety
standards, inadequate training, lacked communication between agencies
and focused on compliance rather than safety.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth and BLM Director
Kathy Clarke enlisted the aviation experts, led by former National
Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall and Texas state
forester Jim Hull, to study the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The report faulted the Federal Aviation Administration for leaving
to contractors the certification and inspection of the aircraft, many
of which are modified World War II military tankers.</TE>
<TE>   "The FAA apparently sees no statutory requirement to oversee
airworthiness," said William Scott, panel member and bureau chief for
Aviation Week and Space Technology Magazine. "This creates a
dangerous situation."</TE>
<TE>   But Allen Kenitzer, FAA spokesman in Seattle, said the
administration is not authorized by Congress to set standards for
aircraft used by the government.</TE>

<HD>Plot to Kidnap Giuliani in Mexico Reported</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A terrorism task force is investigating a report that a Colombian
rebel group is plotting to kidnap former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in
Mexico City, the Daily News reported Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Giuliani said he would continue his trip as an anti-crime
consultant as planned.</LD>
<LD>   "It hasn't in any way interfered in what we've done so far and it
will not interfere with anything we will do," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The threat was described as a discussion about "what they would
get" in terms of ransom for the former mayor, whose consulting firm
has been hired to advise Mexico City police, the News quoted an
unidentified source as saying.</TE>
<TE>   A retired New York City police detective heard of the plans by
Colombia's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, while visiting Mexico on assignment for Giuliani, the
newspaper said, quoting a law enforcement source who spoke on
condition of anonymity. Police Sgt. Kevin Hayes said the department
would not comment on the report.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities told the News that the FBI-NYPD Joint Terrorist Task
Force is taking the threat seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani and his firm, Giuliani Partners, were hired in October to
help lower Mexico City's infamously high violent-crime rate. Giuliani
said he is still working out details of the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "Any discussion on when I go or how I'll go will be announced as
we get closer to doing it," he said at an impromptu book signing in
Midtown Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   Since he left office last year, Giuliani has been protected by a
New York City police security detail.</TE>
<TE>   Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said last week that the
taxpayer-funded protection is justified.</TE>

<HD>At Ground Zero, Iraq Is 'a Totally Different Thing'</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Emerge from the subway station at City Hall. Pass through the tight
back streets of a Lower Manhattan shopping district, decorated for
the season with lighted angels. It's bitterly cold, and the shoppers
waddle about like happy mummies in their heavy coats, mufflers,
woolen hats.</LD>
<LD>   Duck into the Century 21 department store by way of a side door.
Climb the stairs from men's shoes to the main floor and enter a scene
of frantic wonder.</LD>
<LD>   New Yorkers on lunch break and tourists alike jam the aisles,
picking through racks of leather jackets and piles of children's
slippers, lining up five deep at the cash registers.</LD>
<TE>   The P.A. system pipes in a perky "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,"
the music interrupted every few bars: "Could I please have a luggage
associate to the leather complex. Could I please have a linen
associate to the housewear complex."</TE>
<TE>   It's loud, warm, festive and, in a chaotic sort of way, peaceful,
but the time has come to push through the main entrance, through two
sets of glass doors covered in ornate metal grilles. They open onto
Church Street.</TE>
<TE>   Here, at once, the carols stop and the cold returns like a slap
and the shoppers lose their mirth. Even those who know what to expect
seem startled, blinking eyes, swallowing smiles.</TE>
<TE>   Directly across the street from these doors is a hole in the
ground, four blocks wide, three blocks deep, seven stories down. It
is the hole where the World Trade Center once stood, the hole known
as ground zero.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I came to ground zero -- which is stripped of debris, sanitized
and surrounded now by tidy steel fence work -- to ask people who live
and work around it about Iraq, about the possibility of war. It
seemed logical enough.</TE>
<TE>   In pressing for "regime change" in Iraq, the Bush administration
and other advocates have made repeated references to this hole in the
ground and all that it represents. They see ground zero and the
showdown with Iraq as points on the same line, part of a general "war
on terror" that had in 9/11 its Pearl Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech Monday, Vice President Dick Cheney put it this way:
"Confronting the threat posed by Iraq is not a distraction from the
war on terror. It is absolutely crucial to winning the war on
terror."</TE>
<TE>   Not all the New Yorkers I bumped into, though, could follow such
logic. Some failed to see -- beyond the rhetoric of politics -- any
connective tissue between the hell unleashed here on Sept. 11 and the
case for taking on Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they are trying to blame it on that," said Eva Hansson,
who works at a jewelry store two blocks from ground zero. "It's scary
to think that what happened here would be used as a reason to go to
war in Iraq. I mean, we already went into Afghanistan, right? It
should be even."</TE>
<TE>   As for war talk, she had heard more on a recent vacation to Sweden
than she does in Lower Manhattan: "New Yorkers don't have time for
war. We are always on a schedule, rushing around, trying to make ends
meet in order to get enough money to pay the high rents."</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Augustin Castillo, a 25-year-old Marine seated behind a desk
in a second-story recruiting station across from City Hall, was
puzzled at first to be asked about Iraq and 9/11 in the same breath.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure I understand your question," he said. "I feel like
it is a totally different thing. What happened here was one thing.
Iraq is another. We were involved in Iraq before what happened here."</TE>
<TE>   Castillo had been at this desk on Sept. 11, 2001, had watched the
events unfold two blocks away from the street below, had spent that
long day shepherding the injured to a nearby hospital. And when the
recruiting station reopened a few days later, he and his colleagues
were swamped with volunteers raring to go.</TE>
<TE>   "We got a lot of calls from 55-year-old vets," he said. "They were
saying, 'We're still in shape and we want to come back and do
something.' " That initial flurry passed, and the recruiting pace at
the station has long since returned to what it was before Sept. 11,
about a dozen or so recruits a month.</TE>
<TE>   Do they mention Iraq when they sign up, Castillo was asked.</TE>
<TE>   "No," he said, "It doesn't come up much."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On the Church Street sidewalk, a block or two from the department
store doors, B.L. Parkinson stood at a folding table, one in a row of
vendors hawking "souvenirs" to a small but steady stream of ground
zero tourists.</TE>
<TE>   She sells American flags with the names of all the 9/11 dead
printed across the stars and stripes. Called "the flag of heroes," it
goes for $20. A portion of the money, Parkinson said, goes to one of
the 9/11 charities. Business was slow this day, which she blamed on
the cold.</TE>
<TE>   A kind, soft-spoken woman in her mid-50s, wearing a pink fuzzy hat
and scarf to match her lipstick, Parkinson said she had worked on the
65th floor of the south tower, as an assistant to an attorney, but
was downsized a month before the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   She pointed her mitten at a place high in the bright sky over the
hole.</TE>
<TE>   "My office used to be right there," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, she said, the economic fallout from the trade center collapse
and the stalled economy in general were making things tough: "If you
told me a year ago I'd be out on the street, selling flags on the
corner of Church and Vesey, I'd have thought you were crazy."</TE>
<TE>   As for going to war with Iraq, she believed she had a better idea:</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of spending billions to go bomb Iraq, they should take
that money and invest it here, in the city. Charity begins at home.
That's the way it seems to me. We have people here who have lost
their jobs, who need to be fed, clothed.</TE>
<TE>   "Go ahead. Go after the terrorists, contain Iraq with sanctions
and diplomacy, but don't go to war. It doesn't make any sense. There
is a disconnect. I am sorry, there is. There is a major disconnect
between what happened here and what is happening in Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   No connection? "None.</TE>
<TE>   "No.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely not."</TE>
<TE>   She was, of course, but one New Yorker, speaking her mind as only
New Yorkers can. And here might be the place to remember that there
are 3,000 people who won't be given a chance to participate in the
great war debate. Their names can be found on the flags this woman
sells, across the street from a 17-acre hole in the ground.</TE>

<HD>Democrats Prevail in Louisiana</HD>
<DH>Bush's efforts rebuffed as Landrieu fends off a strong
challenge to retain her Senate seat. And in an upset, GOP loses a
House race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson and Lianne Hart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Sen. Mary Landrieu narrowly won reelection to a second term Saturday,
while another Louisiana Democrat scored an upset in a runoff House
election, giving their party a jolt of adrenaline after a year of
Republican electoral triumph.</LD>
<LD>   Landrieu turned back a forceful Republican challenge from Suzanne
Haik Terrell, winning 51.6% to 48.4% in unofficial returns. She held
together a tenuous southern Democratic coalition of black liberals
and white moderates four days after a fired-up President Bush came to
the state to press for one more Senate GOP victory.</LD>
<LD>   "We turned the lights on!" a hoarse Landrieu told supporters in a
hotel ballroom here shortly before midnight. "People can see the
dangers of partisan, poisoned politics....The light has shown that
the Democratic Party is alive and well and united."</LD>
<TE>   In the House race, Democrat Rodney Alexander unexpectedly won, by
a few hundred votes, a vacant seat, the 5th District in northeastern
Louisiana, which had been expected to remain in GOP hands. Republican
Lee Fletcher said he would review official results before deciding
whether to concede.</TE>
<TE>   With the year's final congressional elections over, Republicans
will hold a 51-seat Senate majority when the 108th Congress convenes
Jan. 7. Democrats will hold 48 seats, and there is one
Democrat-aligned independent. The Republican House majority is
projected to be 229-205, with another Democratic-leaning independent.
The numbers in the House could change, pending a special election in
Hawaii in January and a recount in Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   With her victory in a nasty, bare-knuckled campaign, Landrieu
avoided becoming another casualty in what had been a GOP onslaught
powered by Bush. In the Nov. 5 midterm elections, Republicans
expanded their House majority by six seats and retook control of the
Senate -- defying the historical norm for a president's party. The
president's carefully timed trips were considered to have made the
difference in several swing races.</TE>
<TE>   The House and Senate victories in Louisiana gave Democrats a badly
needed lift as they regroup for the congressional and presidential
elections in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, meanwhile, fell short in their bid to seize a Senate
seat from Louisiana for the first time since the 1880s. Their Senate
majority remains razor thin. A switch of one seat to the Democrats
could drop the chamber back into an effective tie; a switch of two
would give Democrats control again.</TE>
<TE>   Landrieu was pressed to the limit to defeat Terrell, whose
candidacy was promoted heavily by an array of national Republican
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Once favored to win reelection, Landrieu seemed much more
vulnerable after falling short in her first try last month and after
Democratic senators from Georgia and Missouri lost to Republicans who
Bush campaigned for.</TE>
<TE>   She and Terrell wound up their politicking in New Orleans after a
31-day campaign unprecedented for the state.</TE>
<TE>   Never before has Louisiana chosen a U.S. senator in a December
runoff. Under the state's election laws, nine candidates for Senate
appeared on the Nov. 5 ballot. But because none captured more than
50% of the vote, the two top finishers -- Landrieu first, and Terrell
second -- landed in the runoff.</TE>
<TE>   Landrieu rolled up huge margins in New Orleans, a Democratic
enclave, to offset Terrell strongholds in western and northern
Louisiana.</TE>
<TE>   The Landrieu name is well-known in the city: the senator's father,
Moon Landrieu, was mayor in the 1970s and served as a Cabinet
secretary in the Carter administration.</TE>
<TE>   And the city's voters were essential to Mary Landrieu's first
Senate win. In 1996, she captured 100,000 votes more than her
Republican opponent in the New Orleans area en route to a victory of
fewer than 6,000 votes statewide.</TE>
<TE>   On a crisp, sunny Saturday, she crisscrossed the city in a
get-out-the-vote driving tour led by a red truck blaring zydeco
music. She hopped out at a Winn-Dixie grocery store around noon and
started shaking hands with startled shoppers, baggers and checkout
clerks.</TE>
<TE>   Janell Ridgley, 23, a Winn-Dixie employee, said she planned to
vote for Landrieu during an afternoon break.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the intense focus on the race, Ridgley said, "It's so
serious this time. My mother threatened me: 'I'm going to hurt you if
you don't vote.' "</TE>
<TE>   But Terrell, a former New Orleans city councilwoman, had pockets
of strength in the city. And her voters, like Landrieu's, appeared
highly motivated.</TE>
<TE>   John Gish, 55, a benefits consultant, had an eye on the bigger
picture in Congress as he recently cast an absentee ballot for
Terrell. Aware that the Republicans already had sewed up control of
the Senate next year, he said: "I actually want a large conservative
majority."</TE>
<TE>   Landrieu, 47, is a centrist who has frequently voted with the Bush
administration on major issues, such as 2001's sweeping tax cut and
this fall's resolution to authorize using military force against
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Cognizant of Bush's popularity, she stressed that she backed the
administration about three-fourths of the time in key congressional
votes.</TE>
<TE>   But Terrell, 48, the state's elections commissioner, countered
that the president would be best served by adding another Republican
to the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of televised debates and in dueling TV advertisements,
Landrieu and Terrell traded sharp attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Landrieu charged that Terrell had been a lobbyist for a foreign
drug company.</TE>
<TE>   Terrell attacked the senator as a liberal akin to Sen. Hillary
Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) in a radio ad that featured an impersonation
of ex-President Clinton. She also accused Landrieu of abandoning the
Roman Catholic faith on the question of abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Terrell, also a Catholic, backs a constitutional ban on abortion.
Landrieu supports abortion rights, with some exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Their public exchanges grew so strained that Landrieu told Terrell
after one debate, "This is your last campaign."</TE>
<TE>   The challenger afterward said she interpreted that remark as a
threat.</TE>
<TE>   Before the polls closed, both parties mounted a frenzied push to
turn out their supporters. Mailboxes were flooded with brochures.
Campaign workers leafleted doorsteps and knocked on doors. Others
stood on street corners and waved signs to remind people to vote.</TE>
<TE>   Then there were the automated "robo-calls."</TE>
<TE>   Republican gun owners -- some of whom were outdoors on the first
day of hunting season -- were targeted with a tape-recorded telephone
message from Vice President Dick Cheney. Military veterans leaning
toward the GOP heard from former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, a
World War II veteran.</TE>
<TE>   On the Democratic side, former President Clinton taped a telephone
call directed at black voters. Many also received phone messages from
Sen. John B. Breaux, a popular centrist Democrat, and Rep. William J.
Jefferson, who is influential among black voters in New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Several black members of Congress also have traveled to the state
in recent days to help Landrieu, including Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los
Angeles).</TE>

<HD>Global Climate Shift Seen in Polar Ice Melt</HD>
<DH>Levels in Greenland, Arctic Ocean shrank to new lows this
year, heightening environmental fears.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Usha Lee McFarling</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Ice in the Arctic Ocean and on Greenland's massive icecap shrank to
record levels this summer, providing more evidence that global
warming is causing unprecedented environmental change that is
alarming seasoned climate-watchers.</LD>
<LD>   "I was really surprised by this," said Mark Serreze, a polar
researcher at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder,
Colo., who announced the findings Saturday at a meeting of scientists
here. "This was the craziest summer I've seen up there."</LD>
<LD>   The news comes at a time when researchers are becoming
increasingly concerned about abrupt climate change. In the geological
past, rapid changes linked to global warming and the melting of polar
ice have resulted in century-long droughts and sea level increases
that could cripple many of today's low-lying cities.</LD>
<TE>   "If we do nothing, warming in the next 150 years could be enough
to melt the Greenland ice sheet, causing a 3- to 6-meter [about
10-foot to 20-foot] sea level rise that could be catastrophic," said
Jonathan Overpeck, an expert on past climates at the University of
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Arctic sea ice is at its minimum in September, at the end of the
summer. At that time, ice normally covers 2.4 million square miles of
ocean north of Greenland, Russia and Canada. This summer, ice covered
just 2 million square miles and was extremely thin in many regions,
said Ted Scambos of the Colorado data center. It's the lowest seen
since scientists began closely monitoring the Arctic by satellite 24
years ago, Serreze said, and is probably a record for the last 50
years. Historical records kept by fishermen in Iceland are spotty,
but suggest that Arctic sea ice has not been so low for centuries, he
added.</TE>
<TE>   The icecap on Greenland, the second-largest mass of frozen
freshwater in the world after Antarctica, also broke all records for
melting this summer. Satellites recorded melting across nearly
265,000 square miles of the icecap, which is about the size of Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Melting occurred even on the island's northernmost reaches and to
elevations as high as 6,560 feet that are normally too cold to melt.
There was so much flooding at the surface that glaciologist Konrad
Steffen of the University of Colorado had to be evacuated by
helicopter in June. His camp was under more than a foot of water,
said Steffen, who plans to start next year's field season a month
early to avoid flooding.</TE>
<TE>   The 14,000-foot-thick Greenland icecap has thinned several feet
per year in some areas, he said. This is not caused directly by the
melting, but by water that seeps through crevasses to the bottom of
the ice and then helps the ice flow more quickly to the sea, where it
breaks off as icebergs that eventually melt.</TE>
<TE>   The dramatic loss of ice in the Arctic Ocean and Greenland,
coupled with other new work showing the rise of trees and shrubs
across once-barren Arctic tundra lands, "presents a compelling case
that something is changing very rapidly over a wide area," said Larry
Hinzman, an expert in Arctic change at the University of Alaska at
Fairbanks.</TE>
<TE>   Oceanographers who study the region are seeing changes in the
water beneath the ice as well. Salinity and temperature are starting
to shift, suggesting that the ocean may be circulating differently,
said James Morison, an oceanographer at the University of
Washington's Polar Science Center.</TE>
<TE>   Even subtle changes can dramatically effect the oceans' largest
currents.</TE>
<TE>   The most dramatic of these is a reversal of the Gulf Stream, which
normally warms Europe by about 10 degrees Fahrenheit but stopped
abruptly 11,000 years ago, leading to a mini Ice Age for the area.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists here are trying to understand exactly what is causing
these changes. Many studies suggest that greenhouse gases produced by
industrial activity are to blame for about half of the roughly
2-degree warming of the planet seen in recent decades, and natural
factors are blamed for the other half.</TE>
<TE>   The Arctic sea ice is influenced dramatically by a decades-long
cycle called the "Arctic oscillation," which varies between a phase
that leaves much of the Arctic cold and still and one that leaves it
warm and windy. Though the phases alternate normally every decade or
so, the Arctic has stayed locked in the warm and windy phase since
the 1980s, Serreze said.</TE>
<TE>   Serreze blames the warm stretch and its many storms for the lack
of sea ice. But that doesn't mean that he pins the changes on Mother
Nature alone.</TE>
<TE>   A growing body of research suggests that human pollutants,
including ozone-destroying chemicals and greenhouse gases, are
responsible for keeping the Arctic oscillation locked in the warmer
mode, he said. Environmental groups and many foreign nations are
criticizing U.S. leaders for not taking action to reduce the output
of greenhouse gases.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush convened a summit on global warming in Washington
last week, but said that the issue needed to be researched further
before any implementation of potentially costly rules.</TE>
<TE>   With Arctic ice so dramatically on the wane, many scientists here
remained skeptical of that policy. "As a scientist, I certainly
advocate continued research," Serreze said.</TE>
<TE>   "But the longer we wait, the longer we procrastinate, and the
bigger our problems will be in the future."</TE>

<HD>Up in Arms at Mexico Border</HD>
<DH>A newspaper editor's militia fulfills what he calls his
patriotic duty to thwart illegal migrants. Some fear lawsuits or even
deaths could result.</DH>

<DL>TOMBSTONE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>If these were the days of frontier justice, newspaper editor Chris
Simcox would fit right in. With a .45-caliber handgun strapped to his
side, he rustles through river-bottom oaks and reeds, looking for
outlaws.</LD>
<LD>   His prey: foreigners, and maybe terrorists, who illegally cross
into the United States from Mexico. His posse: 600 citizens who share
his frustration about the porous border.</LD>
<LD>   Simcox, owner and editor of the Tombstone Tumbleweed, has formed
an armed militia to patrol the U.S.-Mexico border, fulfilling what he
says is his patriotic duty to thwart illegal immigrants by placing
them under citizen arrest.</LD>
<TE>   About a dozen members of the militia held their first strategy
meeting Saturday at the O.K. Cafe, a sourdough biscuit's throw away
from the corral where Marshal Virgil Earp, brothers Wyatt and Morgan
and buddy John "Doc" Holliday shot and killed three cowboys for
carrying guns in town.</TE>
<TE>   Townsfolk complain that the militia's activities will tarnish
Tombstone. Authorities and civil rights activists warn that Simcox's
tactics will lead to lawsuits, if not injuries or deaths from
gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seriously concerned, because we could end up having
citizens killing people or getting harmed themselves," said Mary
Frances Berry, chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. The
agency has asked the Justice Department for a report on the militia's
activities.</TE>
<TE>   Others applaud Simcox. "He's drawing attention to a problem that's
largely ignored by politicians and agencies who are supposed to
protect us," local rancher Henry Harvey said.</TE>
<TE>   Anger about the growing number of illegal immigrants crossing
Cochise County's 82-mile-long border with Mexico has been mounting
for years. The number of arrests more than doubled in two years to
438,489 in 2000 as the Border Patrol heightened enforcement elsewhere
in the Southwest and immigrants found the borders near here easy to
breach.</TE>
<TE>   Immigrants arrested for committing crimes in the county cost
Cochise County nearly $5 million that year in police, court and jail
costs, said Pat Call, chairman of the county Board of Supervisors.
"We're having to bear the brunt of the federal government's failed
border policy," Call said.</TE>
<TE>   After the Border Patrol built sturdier fences, increased lighting
and added agents along this part of the border, the number of
crossers caught dropped to 156,950 in the last year, but critics
argue that more needs to be done. The Border Patrol would not
disclose the number of agents assigned to the county, but the agency
has more than 1,700 agents along the Arizona border.</TE>
<TE>   Simcox's militia, called the Civil Homeland Defense, is one of at
least three citizens groups formed along the U.S.-Mexico border to
intimidate illegal immigrants from entering the country.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really believe the militia will make that much of a
difference," said Greg Moore, one of Homeland Defense's volunteers.
"But we have to make a statement to the government.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going out half-cocked, and we'll try to screen out all
the wackos," said Moore, who served in the Marine Corps and now
operates a Tombstone bed-and-breakfast inn.</TE>
<TE>   Simcox hopes that deploying militia members visibly along the
border 30 miles south of here, in small groups and in 24-hour shifts,
will deter illegal immigrants. Those who cross will be captured,
handcuffed using plastic ties, read their Miranda rights and placed
under citizen arrest until picked up by the Border Patrol, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever is wary of citizen arrests.
"There's not a person in this county who hasn't experienced a great
amount of frustration over the federal government's lack of
responsibility," he said. But that doesn't allow Simcox to engage in
activities that may be legally viewed as kidnappings, Dever said, and
"we're prepared to take action if necessary."</TE>
<TE>   Militia members will identify themselves as security guards,
Simcox said, and he is toying with creating laminated ID cards
embossed with "President's Volunteer Corps."</TE>
<TE>   Simcox said he will screen members' criminal backgrounds and gun
safety knowledge by having them qualify for a state concealed-weapon
permit. Guns will only be drawn for life-and-death self-defense, he
said, and if the immigrants run, they will not be chased. "There's no
doubt someone will be killed one day -- one of us -- by drug
traffickers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simcox and his supporters contend that illegal immigrants strain
the nation's drug enforcement and health-care systems and burglarize
ranches and homes near the border. Simcox also worries that
terrorists may sneak across with biological or chemical weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to force the president of the United States to do his
job," Simcox said. "He took an oath to protect us from enemies. He
has no business sending troops to foreign countries when he hasn't
sealed our own borders."</TE>
<TE>   Simcox, 42, is a former Los Angeles elementary school teacher and
home-school consultant who moved here last year. He said he
encountered so many illegal immigrants and heavily armed drug
traffickers when camping that he joined 40 men volunteering as
security guards for landowners adjacent to the border. They notified
the Border Patrol of the exact locations of crossings, but agents
seldom responded, he said.</TE>
<TE>   After a couple of odd jobs, he was hired as a reporter on the
Tumbleweed, and later bought the weekly. Readers said the paper
improved under his guidance, and circulation increased.</TE>
<TE>   But no one in the town of 1,500 was ready for the Page One
headline Oct. 24 that betrayed his border-protection obsession:
"Enough Is Enough! A Public Call to Arms! Citizens Border Patrol
Militia Now Forming!"</TE>
<TE>   Simcox smiled as he recalled the uproar. Some residents quickly
enlisted, some ridiculed him, and others worried about the town's
image and the possibility of violence.</TE>
<TE>   "Tombstone is turning into a militia camp instead of a
family-oriented tourism town. This is giving the whole town a black
eye," said Sally Alves, who runs a bed-and-breakfast inn.</TE>
<TE>   Tombstone's Wild West image drives the town's singular industry:
tourism. A stagecoach plies the historic main street where the
original Bird Cage Theater and Big Nose Kate's saloon are now crowded
by souvenir shops and Western clothing stores. Cowboys packing
six-shooters and wearing dusters sell tickets to reenactments of
shootouts.</TE>
<TE>   Civil rights activist and defense attorney Isabel Garcia, who
co-chairs Derechos Humanos, said Simcox's call to arms "is incendiary
and outrageous."</TE>
<TE>   "In this country, we don't allow the military -- or militias -- to
enforce civilian laws," she said. Citizens can only make arrests if
they witness a felony, or a misdemeanor where immediate action is
required to thwart more wrongdoing, she said. Under federal law,
crossing the border illegally for the first time is a misdemeanor.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't have civilians taking the law into their own hands and
detaining people -- especially if you're in no position to know for
sure if a law is broken," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Legal issues aside, Mayor Dusty Escapule said he's "afraid some
innocent people are going to get hurt or killed, and we'll have an
international incident on our hands.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm worried [Simcox is] going to attract radicals who want to go
on a human hunt."</TE>

<HD>After Furor, N.Y. Times Prints Rejected Columns on Augusta</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The New York Times published two sports columns today about the
Augusta National Golf Club's refusal to admit women that the
newspaper's editors initially had rejected. The decision to run the
columns came after the paper endured heavy criticism from outside
observers and its own reporters.</LD>
<LD>   Media experts speculated that the Times spiked the columns because
they conflicted with the paper's editorial stance on the Augusta
National issue. That raised the specter that a newspaper, which is
charged with encouraging debate of important issues, was silencing
its own commentators.</LD>
<LD>   But in a New York Times story Saturday announcing plans to print
the columns, Executive Editor Howell Raines said opinions expressed
in them had nothing to do with their rejection.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, the story said, a column by Dave Anderson was held
because it "gave the appearance of unnecessary intramural squabbling"
with the paper's editorial board, and a column by Harvey Araton had
"problems of structure and tone."</TE>
<TE>   Raines said in the story: "Some of the commentary said, 'It's
wrong to censor opinions of columnists.' I agree with that. That's
not what happened here."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "There is not now, nor will there ever be, any attempt
to curb the opinions of our writers."</TE>
<TE>   Raines refused further comment Saturday, said Catherine Mathis, a
Times spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   The paper reported it would print "revised versions" of the
columns, but Mathis said that meant they would go through "normal
editing" and be adjusted to reflect that two weeks had passed since
they had been written.</TE>
<TE>   Mathis refused to comment on whether the controversy played a role
in the decision to publish the columns.</TE>
<TE>   Media experts Saturday praised the decision to print the columns
but said the episode remained troubling.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't spike or kill opinion because it differs from something
that may or may not have run on an editorial page," said Sandy Padwe,
an associate professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of
Journalism. "I never thought that kind of thing would happen at the
New York Times, and that it did is absolutely shocking."</TE>
<TE>   The columns dealt with Augusta's refusal to admit women as
members, a story that the Times has pursued aggressively in its news
and editorial pages. A Nov. 18 editorial suggested that premier
golfer Tiger Woods should boycott the Masters tournament, the
prestigious golf match held at the club, to force the organization to
admit women.</TE>
<TE>   The column by the Pulitzer Prize-winning Anderson argued that
Woods should not have to forgo the tournament. His piece made a
"passing reference" to the Nov. 18 editorial, the Times story said.
Araton's column raised questions about the significance of the
Augusta issue, it said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither columnist returned phone calls to their office Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Media observers said they were not persuaded by the Times'
explanation for why the columns were held. If the stories required
only minor revisions, the changes should have been made during the
regular editing process and the stories should have run promptly,
they said.</TE>
<TE>   "Their explanations really didn't match their actions," said Tom
Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, a
think tank affiliated with the Columbia journalism school. "Their
actions appeared as though they didn't want anybody to contradict the
opinions of their editorial page."</TE>
<TE>   The furor erupted last week when the New York Daily News reported
that the columns had been spiked.</TE>

<HD>Survivors, Families Gather for Tribute at Pearl Harbor</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii</DL>
<LD>With America girding for possible war with Iraq, about 150 people,
including survivors of the attack on Pearl Harbor and their families,
gathered Saturday to pay tribute to those who lost their lives 61
years ago.</LD>
<LD>   "We hope and pray that if we are once again called upon to help
send our brave men and women into battle, we will find ourselves
blessed with the special sort of America that helped us conquer,"
Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii) said at a commemorative ceremony
aboard the USS ``Arizona Memorial.</LD>
<LD>   Inouye, who lost an arm fighting in World War II, made no direct
reference to Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   The group observed a moment of silence at 7:55 a.m., the time the
Japanese surprise attack started, and a group of airplanes from the
Hawaii Air National Guard flew over in a "missing man" formation. A
stiff wind blew, and sailors had to struggle to raise an 18-foot
American flag.</TE>
<TE>   "It reminds me of the days when everybody was aboard," said Ski
Kowalski, 82, of San Diego, who was aboard the Pennsylvania during
the attack Dec. 7, 1941.</TE>
<TE>   The attack on Pearl Harbor and other military bases on Oahu lasted
two hours. Twenty-one ships were heavily damaged, and 323 aircraft
were damaged or destroyed. In all, 2,390 people were killed and 1,178
wounded.</TE>
<TE>   One bomb ripped open the Arizona, which sank at its mooring along
Battleship Row in nine minutes. It remains a tomb for more than 900
of its 1,177 crewmen.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's observance was subdued compared with last year's, when
the 60th anniversary of the attack and its parallels with the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon drew thousands to
Hawaii. The more reserved observance did not diminish the
significance of the day, said Daniel Martinez, a historian for the
USS Arizona Memorial.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the type of attack that was so savage that it's just etched
into the memories of Americans," he said. "It's a stain in the
American fabric that's difficult to wash away."</TE>
<TE>   Warren Verhoff, 81, who was a radioman on the Keosanqua during the
attack, said it didn't matter that fewer survivors attended
Saturday's event.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more than that," said Verhoff, a volunteer at the memorial.
"It's not only for World War II veterans. It's for every ...
serviceman that was ever in the service."</TE>

<HD>Probe Sought of Postal Service Anthrax Actions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A conservative watchdog group is seeking a criminal investigation
into the U.S. Postal Service's handling of last year's anthrax
contamination that killed two workers at a Washington post office.</LD>
<LD>   Judicial Watch submitted documents to a federal prosecutor that it
says prove postal and government officials knew anthrax spores had
leaked from a letter sent to Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) into the
Brentwood mail processing center but neither warned workers nor shut
the site.</LD>
<LD>   "The government does not have the right to injure people, to harm
them, and that's what [officials] did through their action and
inaction," Larry Klayman, Judicial Watch's chairman, said Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Judicial Watch filed the complaint Friday with the office of the
U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   Postal Service spokeswoman Kristin Krathwohl said the agency
believed the allegations were "without merit."</TE>
<TE>   "But since this complaint has been filed with the U.S. attorney's
office, we will confer with officials there," Krathwohl said
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Judicial Watch also said the records, obtained through a Freedom
of Information Act request, showed the decision was made not to close
the Brentwood facility after the anthrax attacks began in October
2001 because it would have cost the post office $500,000 per day.</TE>
<TE>   The Judicial Watch complaint said a postal policy written in 1999
ordered the mandatory evacuation of premises whenever anthrax had
been found.</TE>
<TE>   Klayman's group also filed a complaint with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission on Friday alleging that the government
discriminated against Brentwood's 2,200 workers, most of whom are
black, by not immediately administering antibiotics after they were
exposed to anthrax. The predominantly white staffs in the offices of
Daschle and Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), where another anthrax
letter was sent, were treated promptly.</TE>
<TE>   Brentwood postal workers Joseph Curseen Jr. and Thomas Morris Jr.
died last year from inhalation anthrax. The Brentwood facility still
has not been reopened.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Transit Union Gets Strike OK</HD>
<DH>Members authorize stoppage if talks with city fail. Walkout
could be declared Dec. 15.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Transit workers have authorized union leaders to call a strike if
contract talks with the city fail, union officials said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The union's executive board could make the decision Dec. 15, when
the current contract expires, Transport Workers Union Local 100
President Roger Toussaint said.</LD>
<LD>   "Our members moved a resolution to authorize the executive board
of Local 100 to call a strike if all else fails," he said. Thousands
of the 34,000 union members attended a meeting to vote on the
resolution.</LD>
<TE>   Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said a walkout by the subway and bus
employees would force the city to spend an additional $10 million a
day in police overtime to account for the traffic increase during the
holiday shopping season. "A strike would be illegal and phenomenally
damaging to our city," he said.</TE>
<TE>   State law bars strikes by public employees. The last transit
strike in the city was in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   The city's transit agency offered no raises in the first year of a
proposed three-year pact and said it may negotiate raises for the
last two years if the union increased productivity.</TE>
<TE>   "The municipal workforce ... has to understand that the days of
getting raises without improving productivity are over," Bloomberg
said. The city is facing a budget deficit of as much as $6 billion
next year.</TE>
<TE>   More than 7 million people ride MTA buses and trains each day,
making the city's public transit system by far the nation's largest.</TE>

<HD>Dance Between Media, Investigators Preceded Raid on Ptech</HD>
<DH>CBS' Boston station first learned the firm was the target
of a terror probe, but agreed to hold off on the story. ABC News got
exclusive footage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When federal agents raided a Massachusetts firm suspected of links to
Osama bin Laden's terrorist network early Friday, ABC News got the
exclusive footage. And thereby hangs a tale.</LD>
<LD>   Eight news organizations knew of the investigation in advance and
agreed to sit on the story, according to government sources. But the
news outlet that had been working on the case the longest, the CBS
station in Boston, wasn't told that the raid was imminent.</LD>
<LD>   "We were promised that because we agreed to hold off, we would be
told before the raid was held," said Joe Bergantino, a reporter for
Boston's WBZ-TV. "In the end that didn't happen. We certainly were
disappointed. We were lied to. It was an unsettling and disturbing
development."</LD>
<TE>   The Quincy, Mass., software company, Ptech Inc., is a U.S.
government contractor that is largely financed by Yasin al Qadi, a
Saudi businessman accused of funneling millions of dollars to Al
Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   The behind-the-scenes negotiations reflect the kind of delicate
dance between law enforcement and the media that sometimes precedes
high-profile arrests and drug busts. The resulting footage can cast
the authorities in a favorable light while providing journalists with
exclusive pictures.</TE>
<TE>   "When a reporter learns of an investigation, you ask their help in
not reporting it," a Customs Service official said. In this case,
"everyone said we don't want to screw up an investigation. But at
some point nearly every reporter said I've got to go with my story."</TE>
<TE>   WBZ began investigating in June when a local businesswoman who was
considering doing business with Ptech contacted the FBI and, after
getting little guidance about whether the firm was reputable, called
the station. Soon Bergantino and government investigators were
getting information from the same sources.</TE>
<TE>   "We were essentially asked by the Treasury Department to hold our
story for national security reasons," Bergantino said. "A decision
was made that it could jeopardize the investigation, and we agreed to
hold back."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, ABC and NBC also learned of the probe and agreed
to the government's request to withhold the news, officials at the
networks said. NBC was staking out the area around Ptech.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the media may have spurred the authorities into action.
"We discussed with them that we were getting impatient with this,"
Bergantino said. "At one point, we said we were considering going"
this week.</TE>
<TE>   "There was never any threat," he added.</TE>
<TE>   ABC investigative reporter Brian Ross got word from his sources
Thursday "that other news organizations had violated the agreement,
and we should be aware something could happen in the next 24 hours."
A major snowstorm had shut down the New York airports, so ABC
dispatched staffers by train to a parking lot outside the Ptech
offices in Quincy.</TE>
<TE>   "We stationed a camera crew in the vicinity, which late at night
spotted a number of cars belonging to federal agents," Ross said. "We
waited for them to move and followed them into the site." The raid
went down at midnight -- less than 90 minutes after the crew arrived
-- and Ross had the footage for his "Good Morning America" report
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Bergantino, who had been told by his sources that nothing would
happen Thursday night, was unable to report the story until Friday's
noon newscast. Officials at customs and the U.S. attorney's office in
Boston later told the station they had no prior warning of the raid,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish we'd had the phone call that another news organization had
for the midnight pictures, but we're the ones that had the full
story," said WBZ News Director Peter Brown. "We feel as if we made
the absolutely right decision. To me, being first isn't always the
first choice. Being right is more important."</TE>
<TE>   But bragging rights are also important in television. The
station's Web site boasted that the "raid is the direct result of a
WBZ4 I-Team investigation."</TE>

<HD>10 Are Injured in Indiana Train Accident</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CONNERSVILLE, Ind.</DL>
<LD>At least 10 people were injured Saturday night when two cars of an
excursion train overturned in southeastern Indiana about 30 miles
northwest of Cincinnati, Indiana state police reported.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman at the Fayette Memorial Hospital in Connersville said
all of the injured were treated and released, except a teenager who
was admitted in fair condition.</LD>
<LD>   State Trooper Eric Downey said the injured were among about 500
passengers aboard the locomotive-powered train returning from a
holiday shopping excursion to the historic community of Metamora,
Ind., about 16 miles south of Connersville.</LD>
<TE>   The train was returning to Connersville from a late afternoon run
to Metamora on one of the excursion trips operated by the Whitewater
Valley Railroad every weekend before Christmas. The visitors have
three hours to shop in Metamora before the return trip.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the railroad declined to comment about how the
accident occurred, saying that information would not be available
until the National Transportation Safety Board completes its
investigation of the accident.</TE>

<HD>United Airlines Bankruptcy Appears Near</HD>
<DH>After a board meeting, union leaders admit that a Chapter
11 filing is probable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>The United Airlines board of directors held a special meeting
Saturday as union leaders acknowledged that a Chapter 11 bankruptcy
filing by the world's No. 2 carrier appeared imminent.</LD>
<LD>   Airline spokesman Joe Hopkins said the meeting had recessed and
that there would be no more announcements.</LD>
<LD>   With the cash-strapped airline facing debt payments of $920
million in the next few days, union leaders had said on the eve of
the board meeting that a bankruptcy filing was unavoidable.</LD>
<TE>   "It is ... with great disappointment that we are now certain a
bankruptcy filing appears unavoidable and imminent," Randy Canale and
Scotty Ford, leaders of the machinists' union, told members in a
letter posted on the union's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Glenn Tilton, after meeting with union officials,
had said on a company hotline that Chapter 11 was becoming "a more
likely outcome."</TE>
<TE>   Tilton said United had arranged financing enabling it to continue
flying during bankruptcy, but did not give details. The carrier was
believed to have been seeking a $1.5-billion loan.</TE>
<TE>   The board meeting came three days after the rejection of United's
request for a $1.8-billion federal loan guarantee. The three-member
Air Transportation Stabilization Board ruled that United's financial
plans were unsound and that a loan guarantee would be too risky for
taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   After the loan guarantee refusal, shares in parent UAL Corp. fell
7 cents Friday to close at 93 cents a share on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   United, the world's largest airline until American overtook it
last year, traces its problems to a drop in passengers because of the
weak economy and last year's terrorist attacks, an increase in
competition from smaller discount airlines and failed business
strategies.</TE>
<TE>   United makes about 1,700 flights per day and has about 83,000
employees worldwide.</TE>

<HD>Crews Work to Restore Power in N.C. After Huge Ice Storm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Utility repair crews made more progress Saturday at restoring
electricity to hundreds of thousands of customers blacked out by a
major ice storm, as National Guard troops searched for people needing
help.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Mike Easley went on a three-city tour Saturday to survey
damage from one of the worst winter storms in state history, before
he was even able to get a good look at his own home.</LD>
<LD>   One of the places on Easley's itinerary in Charlotte was a shelter
where 84-year-old Anne Mills was playing checkers with 7-year-old
Steve McCorkle.</LD>
<TE>   "I've been here since the morning of the storm and I sure as hell
want some clean clothes," Mills said.</TE>
<TE>   Temperatures climbed into the 40s for a second day, helping to
melt any ice remaining from the storm that arrived Wednesday on a
path that took it from the southern Plains into the Northeast. At
least 29 deaths were blamed on the storm and its aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   The latest casualties, a 79-year-old Shelby man and a 31-year-old
man in Durham, died of carbon monoxide poisoning as they tried to
heat their frozen homes, police said. Their bodies were discovered
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   More than 200 have sought medical help for carbon monoxide
poisoning since the devastating ice storm -- many of them Latino or
Asian immigrants who commonly heated homes with cooking fuels in
their native countries, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   About 300 National Guard volunteers fanned out Saturday into some
of the hardest hit areas to visit homes and ask residents if they had
heat or power.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why we've got the Guard out -- we don't know if people are
getting the information or not. They don't have televisions, and a
lot don't even have a radio with batteries," the governor said.</TE>
<TE>   Friday night, 2,028 people stayed in 67 shelters across the state
as temperatures dropped into the teens in some places.</TE>
<TE>   Utility officials said they had made progress fixing broken power
lines, but nearly 1.1 million customers -- homes and businesses --
remained without electricity Saturday in North and South Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Utility officials acknowledged on Friday that many customers
wouldn't have power back until Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Duke Power said it had 750,000 customers without power in North
Carolina and South Carolina. Carolina Power &amp; Light had 181,000 North
Carolina customers without power. North Carolina's electric
cooperatives reported 50,380 outages.</TE>
<TE>   The National Guard troops were cruising streets and knocking on
doors, Capt. Robert Carver said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're asking people is pretty simple. 'Do you have heat? Do
you have power? Do you want to go to a shelter? If you do want to go
to a shelter, do you have a way to get there, do you have
transportation?' " Carver said. Mills had resisted moving from her
home of 52 years, where she lives alone. She called the Fire
Department on Thursday to ask for a blanket and a cup of hot coffee.
Firefighters, who knew her from previous calls for help, warned her
that she'd freeze to death if she stayed.</TE>
<TE>   "They said, 'This is one time you're going,' " Mills said. "They
were the sweetest, nicest -- I've never known anybody as nice as
those firemen."</TE>

<HD>Brokerage Assists in a Surprise Christmas Homecoming</HD>
<DH>When a homeless woman walked in saying she thought she had
an account, agents were skeptical. Then they checked it out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>A woman who had been wandering the streets for eight years was headed
home for a Christmas reunion with her family because she remembered
she once had invested in the stock market.</LD>
<LD>   When a bedraggled Alice Perley wandered into the brokerage firm of
A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in Nashville last week, the first person she met
by the elevator was Michael Guess.</LD>
<LD>   "I could tell she was homeless," Guess, a financial analyst with
the firm, said Friday. "It was obvious she needed help."</LD>
<TE>   When the woman told him she thought she had some money invested
with the firm, Guess was skeptical, but "we need to help people
regardless, and I wasn't going to walk away from her." So the
44-year-old Guess invited the woman into his office and listened to
her story.</TE>
<TE>   "She was vague about everything except that she remembered the
name of our firm and felt that somehow she had money with us," Guess
said.</TE>
<TE>   Guess said he and another broker took some cash from their pockets
to give her but she refused, insisting she had money in an account.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew something was going on then," Guess said. "So I put
through a call to our company's office in Atlanta and asked them to
check on it."</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later he had confirmation that Perley was a client
-- and that she had been missing for eight years despite exhaustive
search efforts by her family.</TE>
<TE>   Guess said it appeared that Perley, a college graduate with a
chemistry degree, property and other investments, had disappeared
from her home in Kentucky after a painful divorce. She left a
commercial flight during a stopover at Nashville's airport and lived
in the woods, on the streets and in shelters in the intervening
years.</TE>
<TE>   The firm refused to discuss her investment, citing customer
confidentiality.</TE>
<TE>   While Guess was still on the phone with the Edwards office in
Atlanta, the woman's brother, Fred Perley of Charlotte, N.C., called
and talked to her.</TE>
<TE>   "She was happy -- really very happy when she heard her brother's
voice," Guess said. "It was obvious she was ready to come home. At
that point, I left the office to give them privacy, but I don't mind
saying I felt a real glow myself."</TE>
<TE>   The brother came to Nashville on Friday to take the woman home.</TE>
<TE>   Said Guess: "Well, that's what Christmas is really all about,
isn't it? We're not supposed to judge others. We're supposed to
remember to help one another and not just walk on by -- aren't we?"</TE>
