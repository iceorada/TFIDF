<HD>Refreshing 'Croc Hunter' Has Comic Bite</HD>
<DH>Steve Irwin of Animal Planet takes the big screen by the
tail with his usual quirky exuberance and documentary factoids.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Irwin probably drives a lot of people crazy. And with reason.
His manic exuberance combined with his only reasonably convincing
naivete probably makes them feel like one of those venomous reptiles
Irwin swings around by the tail bellowing "Crikey" ("This snake is
mad--really mad!"), as he explains a la Marlin Perkins why the thing
could easily kill "a hundred blokes my size" and prompts the viewer
to choose sides.</LD>
<LD>   So the very idea of making a feature film about Irwin--the wildly
enthusiastic, wildly knowledgeable wild man of the Australian Outback
and the star of Animal Planet's "The Crocodile Hunter"--seems like a
recipe for disaster because the standard recipe would call for him
(and wife Terri, who drives the Jeep and the boat, and can never
quite get the noose around the crocodile's snout) to do everything he
doesn't do well. And that is precisely why "The Crocodile Hunter:
Collision Course" is so refreshing and funny and, in its way,
sophisticated.</LD>
<TE>   Starting with the subplot--a twist in itself--"The Crocodile
Hunter: Collision Course" opens in outer space, where a U.S.
satellite self-destructs, hurling toward Earth its secretive black
box, which lands in Australia and is promptly eaten by a 12-foot
crocodile. The entire intelligence community is on alert, because
loss of the box (actually more of a space ball, with apologies to Mel
Brooks) could affect the future of the free world. Despite this, the
government sends CIA agents to locate the thing and bring it back.</TE>
<TE>   Cut to Steve and Terri who are essentially doing their show--yes,
the aspect ratio changes to television format, Irwin narrates the
action, Terri adds hilariously bland but educational commentary, and
it's as if we're watching Animal Planet.</TE>
<TE>   There is another subplot--a shotgun-toting farm woman (Magda
Szubanski of "Babe") is after the same cow-eating crocodile, which
Irwin is dispatched to relocate. Essentially, though, the Irwins
never leave the sanctity of the documentary format.</TE>
<TE>   Not that they have any idea that the CIA is after them (once they
capture the crocodile, all U.S. surveillance suggests that they, not
the croc, are in possession of the box). The Irwins just think the
crazy guys with guns are poachers and outwit them with the aplomb of
Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Although swathed in the comfortable clothing of the cable show,
"The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course" has a pretty deadly wit.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin's never-ending monologue is consistently cornpone clever,
delivered, as it is, while he has a deadly brown snake by the tail or
is hunched over the back of a sometimes uncooperative crocodile.</TE>
<TE>   There's the ever-so-subtle bit of naughtiness, such as when Terri
takes her shirt off to warm an orphaned baby kangaroo (she has
another on underneath) or when Irwin is particularly impressed by the
equipment on a bird-eating spider ("Does she have a set of fangs on
'er or what!?"). Kids will love it because Irwin is always "mucking"
around in "poo," telling you what the animal ate and then wiping it
on his shirt.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't Tom Stoppard. But it's just about as funny.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG, for action violence/peril and mild language.
Times guidelines: Fine for kids who aren't frightened by the
reptiles.</TE>

<KH>Around the Dial</KH>
<HD>Stations May Have Signals Crossed</HD>
<DH>College-run KXLU says religious broadcaster KTLW is
infringing on its frequency, but the latter says it needs more
details on the affected areas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One is a student-run college station with a small volunteer staff and
a dizzyingly diverse format. The other is a polished evangelical
Christian station, with a signal that's twice as strong as the first.
But this odd couple does have one thing in common--they both occupy
88.9 on the FM dial.</LD>
<LD>   And that's the problem. KXLU, the radio station of Loyola
Marymount University, has complained to the Federal Communications
Commission that its signal is being obliterated by the transmissions
from Lancaster-based KTLW, the Living Way Radio Network. In March,
the latter station erected a device in the Verdugo Hills to extend
its signal into the San Gabriel and La Crescenta valleys.</LD>
<LD>   "They started transmitting from the hills of La Crescenta," said
KXLU general manager Dan Rowan. "That area is a huge area for
us--Silver Lake, Glendale, Burbank. We have a strong listener base
there."</LD>
<TE>   According to the FCC, in December KTLW requested and was granted a
permit for a translator, a device that can boost a station's signal
into an area where it otherwise wouldn't reach. The station already
employs about 15 translators to extend its signal from Alaska to
Illinois, and general manager Gary Curtis said KTLW felt it had
potential listeners in the area around the Verdugo Hills that weren't
being served.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned KXLU listeners no longer getting their dose of reggae,
blues or opera have contacted Rowan asking if the station had gone
off the air or been bought by KTLW, he said. "And the people who can
hear us, it's half us, half them, and static. It's not a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't have those people in October when we do our annual
fund-raiser," Rowan said, "it will make a huge difference. I'm
thinking that it will be at least a third less money."</TE>
<TE>   Rowan said he complained to the local FCC office, and that
attorneys for the university have begun looking into the matter.
Also, since about mid-June, KXLU has placed advertisements in the LA
Weekly asking affected listeners to write the station.</TE>
<TE>   "The next day in the mail, we got 50 of them back. It was really
cool," Rowan said, adding that hundreds more have arrived since then.</TE>
<TE>   The station is also circulating petitions at concerts it sponsors.
Rowan said that when he told KTLW about the complaints, the station
asked for the respondents' names and addresses. He said he refused
out of privacy concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't feel it would be polite to be sending information over
to people who they consider the enemy," said Rowan, 21, a sound
engineering senior from Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis said his station wants to contact the complaining listeners
to see if there truly is a problem, and if so, to figure out a
remedy, such as installing home antennas.</TE>
<TE>   "If people are affected in that area, we'd like to be able to meet
them and see what we can do for them," Curtis said. "KXLU has
erroneously stirred up a number of responses from people who live
outside of the affected area. They have people from Malibu, Long
Beach, Venice."</TE>
<TE>   According to FCC rules, every radio station is supposed to have a
protected broadcast zone in which its signal is free from
interference by stations elsewhere, at the same position on the dial.
Miles outside that perimeter, if no other station interferes,
listeners might still be able to hear the first station--but the area
is up for grabs.</TE>
<TE>   "Every station has a protected zone," said an FCC spokeswoman in
Washington, "but it doesn't reach to infinity."</TE>
<TE>   "If it is an area that's affected, we'll seek to address that,"
Curtis said. But if the interference is coming from KTLW's main
transmitter in Lancaster, or is happening in an area outside KXLU's
protected zone, the listeners are out of luck.</TE>
<TE>   KXLU's Web site vows that the interference "is neither
appreciated, nor will it be tolerated." And Curtis said that some of
the complaints he's received have gotten personal: "They may not like
our station--they have attacked us for being a religious broadcasting
station. I'm sorry for their intolerance."</TE>
<TE>   Such dismay is not surprising, though, as the two stations could
scarcely be more different.</TE>
<TE>   KXLU, which broadcasts at 3,000 watts from the school's Westside
campus, traces its roots to Loyola's radio club of the 1920s. It
features shows such as the "Molotov Cocktail Hour," with its
"sinister" jazz; "Alien Air Music," playing international
electronica; "We Came From Beyond," L.A.'s longest-running hip-hop
show; and "Alma del Barrio," which for 27 years has showcased the
best in Latin music.</TE>
<TE>   KTLW, which broadcasts at 5,800 watts, began five years ago as an
outreach of the Church on the Way in Van Nuys. It features Christian
music and ministry, including programs such as "Messianic Minutes," a
show "aimed at bringing the Gospel to the Jewish people"; "Joni and
Friends," a 22-year-old program delivering the "message of Christ to
people who are affected by disability"; and "The Pat Boone Show," a
music and talk show with the Christian recording artist as host.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC spokeswoman said KTLW's application for the new translator
would have been checked by the agency's engineers before approval, to
make sure it didn't interfere with neighboring stations. She said the
Washington office hasn't yet received a complaint from KXLU, but
would investigate if it does.</TE>
<TE>   Killing with kindness: Temple Grandin has lost count of how many
thousands of cattle she's watched being slaughtered. She's not a
factory farm worker, though, but a consultant and watchdog for
McDonald's who ensures that the slaughterhouses supplying the
fast-food giant comply with the chain's rules for humane treatment of
the animals.</TE>
<TE>   Grandin is one element of "McDonald's New Farm--Fast Food and
Animal Rights," a report scheduled to air at 11 a.m. Saturday on
KCRW-FM (89.9). It's produced by American Radio Works, a joint
venture of Minnesota Public Radio and National Public Radio News.</TE>
<TE>   Reporter Daniel Zwerdling looks at farms and the fast-food
industry, and examines how McDonald's--to the shock of its critics in
the animal-rights community--has taken the lead in making conditions
better for the livestock on its menu.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really astonished at how cruel a lot of the conditions are
for animals," Zwerdling said. "We're really out of touch with the way
animals are raised."</TE>
<TE>   But after years of protests by People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals and other activists, McDonald's imposed new requirements on
its suppliers--changes estimated to cost the company up to $10
million.</TE>
<TE>   When he heard about the changes last year, Zwerdling said, he was
"genuinely captivated and intrigued by the whole issue." While the
humane conditions are good for business--animals that go to their
deaths calmly produce fewer hormones that detract from the meat
quality--McDonald's officials also say that the changes are "the
right thing to do."</TE>

<LD>Jason Alexander will play the rascally Max Bialystock and Martin
Short will play his meek co-conspirator Leo Bloom in the Los Angeles
production of "The Producers" next year at the Pantages Theatre in
Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a dream cast," said the show's creator, Mel Brooks. "Both
these guys are dynamite." Previews will begin May 2, with an opening
night on May 29.</LD>
<LD>   The casting of Alexander and Short had been rumored for months.
Alexander was signed first, but the Short deal was completed only
this week, Brooks said. Neither was asked to audition, he said. "We
know how talented both these guys are."</LD>
<TE>   Although the two stars are better known for TV roles, both have
won Tony Awards for best actor in a musical--Alexander for "Jerome
Robbins' Broadway" in 1989 and Short for "Little Me" in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Both have agreed to stay with the L.A. company during its entire
run, Brooks said, but how long that will be depends on sales. The
initial block of tickets will be available Aug. 6.</TE>
<TE>   The stars will join a touring company that will open in Pittsburgh
in September. The tour's initial stars, Lewis J. Stadlen and Don
Stephenson, will open a second tour when Alexander and Short take
over in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks emphasized that Alexander and Short "are not divas or prima
donnas. They're actors you can have lunch with. Of course you have to
pick up the tab."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The most uneven Hollywood Bowl jazz season of recent memory opened
Wednesday night with a program that defined, in miniature, both the
upside and the downside of this year's scheduling.</LD>
<LD>   Start with the opening act, Ken Peplowski's Tribute to Benny
Goodman Big Band. Peplowski is a fine clarinetist, thoroughly adept
in styles reaching from swing to bebop--a meaningful presence in any
jazz setting. But what really made his performance so special was
that anonymous tribute band, which was, in fact, a virtual Southland
all-star assemblage. It included--among others--saxophonists Gary
Foster, Lanny Morgan and Pete Christlieb, trombonist Andy Martin,
trumpeters Frank Szabo and Warren Luening, bassist Chuck Berghofer
and drummer Frankie Capp. That's a world-class group, by any
definition, yet none was mentioned in the program.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the anonymity, they played a set that was far and away the
musical highlight of the evening. Goodman specials such as "Don't Be
That Way," "Down South Camp Meetin' " and "Sing, Sing, Sing" were
rendered with an authority and vitality surpassing the original
recordings. Peplowski's high-speed romp through a small group version
of "Avalon" rivaled even Goodman's better efforts.</LD>
<TE>   The soloing from Morgan, Martin, Luening and Christlieb was
equally impressive--ironically bringing the full flavor of bebop to
the music of Goodman, a bandleader who resisted the genre for most of
his career. The spirited jitterbugging of four pairs of dancers added
an appealing touch to a program, underscoring an era in which jazz
and popular music were a happy musical couple.</TE>
<TE>   The Glenn Miller Orchestra's appearance paid tribute to the same
era, while minimizing the jazz links. Nearly 60 years after Miller
died in a wartime plane accident, his music continues to find
audiences. And classic swing items such as "Tuxedo Junction," "In the
Mood" and "American Patrol" generated predictably spirited responses
from the surprisingly large crowd of more than 13,000. Although a few
non-Miller items were included--"A Tisket, A Tasket" and, curiously,
a big band version of Lennon &amp; McCartney's "Here, There and
Everywhere"--this was essentially a nostalgia program, important
primarily as a reminder of the continuing allure of big band music.</TE>
<TE>   Nominally headlining the bill, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy played with
the sort of busy vitality that makes the band so attractive to its
fans. Despite an identification with the swing revival movement,
however, its performance had a lot more to do with the '40s
small-band jive of Louis Jordan and the '50s jump music of Louis
Prima. Full of manic rhythm and energy, perfectly matched to the
gymnastics of the dancers, the Voodoo Daddy players were at the
opposite end of the creative musical spectrum from the captivating
work of Peplowski and the Goodman tribute band.</TE>

point is lustily demonstrated by "Sex and Lucia," one very steamy,
very incoherent motion picture.</LD>
<LD>   The kind of trifle that date nights were invented for, the lushly
romantic "Sex and Lucia" is the newest film from Spanish
writer-director Julio Medem. It was nominated for 12 Goyas, the
Spanish version of the Oscars, and took home a few, including best
new actress for star Paz Vega, but it's safe to assume that "most
rigorous narrative logic" wasn't one of its categories.</LD>
<LD>   Medem has been down at least part of this road before with his
last film, "Lovers of the Arctic Circle." Although the climate and
the relationships are noticeably hotter this time around, "Sex and
Lucia" again demonstrates Medem's love of chance and contrivance, his
willingness to stack preposterous coincidences one on top of the
other until we're dizzy from trying to keep things straight. If
plausibility is any part of what you go to movies for, this one will
be a challenge.</LD>
<TE>   On the other hand, "Sex and Lucia" subversively encourages us to
toss plausibility aside, to discard it like a heavy overcoat
mistakenly brought along on a tropical vacation. Medem is one of the
few directors who understands sensuality and knows how to make it
happen on screen. "Sex and Lucia" specializes in pleasant eroticism,
using nudity, Koko de la Rica's dreamy cinematography and Alberto
Iglesias' Goya-winning score to create episodes of voluptuous
lovemaking.</TE>
<TE>   Although most of "Sex and Lucia" is no more than American adult
audiences are used to, there are moments that go further. In line
with a current European art-house trend for show-it-all explicitness,
the film doesn't hesitate to feature brief shots of erections.
(Because Medem absolutely refused to cut these scenes for U.S.
distribution, the film is going out unrated through Chris Blackwell's
Palm Pictures, a small and more venturesome distributor.)</TE>
<TE>   "Sex and Lucia's" complex, often confusing fusion of reality and
fantasy begins with Lucia (Vega), a Madrid waitress involved in a
tempestuous relationship with novelist Lorenzo (Tristan Ulloa), who
is having problems he can't bring himself to confide in her.</TE>
<TE>   Returning to their apartment, Lucia finds Lorenzo gone. After a
devastating phone call, she packs up and flees to an unnamed
Mediterranean island.</TE>
<TE>   Next we flash back six years, before Lorenzo knew Lucia, to a
passionate moonlit sexual adventure he had with a woman (Najwa Nimri,
the star of "Arctic Circle") whose name he doesn't know. What Lorenzo
also doesn't know is that this liaison had consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Now "Sex and Lucia" alternates between two plot strands. One is
what happens to Lucia on the island, how she interacts with the
people she runs into, individuals who turn out to have, depending on
your point of view, either magical or ridiculous connections to the
rest of the story.</TE>
<TE>   The second thread is a flashback to how Lucia and Lorenzo met and
how their relationship developed. Sex had a lot to do with it, and it
is much to the film's benefit that performers Vega and Ulloa are not
only a handsome couple, but also exude a likability that makes us
happy to see them so content.</TE>
<TE>   At a certain point, as writers will, Lorenzo starts another novel,
and this is where "Sex and Lucia" gets truly confusing. It becomes
increasingly difficult to tell if the people on screen actually
exist, if they're products of his imagination or if they're
half-real, half-imagined hybrids. Or maybe the notion is that Lorenzo
invests so much of himself in his fictional story that it becomes
real.</TE>
<TE>   This is the kind of thing that will give you a headache if you
think about it too much.</TE>
<TE>   Precisely to keep us from thinking, "Sex and Lucia" throws in
frequent shots of unclothed cast members. It also counts on our
assuming that its out-there plot is as much of a pleasant fantasy as
the beautiful bodies and the steamy liaisons. "Sex and Lucia" has a
tendency to be too pleased with itself, and it doesn't have the
emotional resonance it aspires to. But if you want to throw reason to
the wind, it's certainly a diverting place to start.</TE>

<HD>The Test of Time in 'Me Without You'</HD>
<DH>Sandra Goldbacher tells an honest tale of a friendship's
good and bad effects. Anna Friel and Michelle Williams glow in the
roles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Writer-director Sandra Goldbacher follows up her promising "The
Governess" with "Me Without You," an engaging, straightforward
narrative about two childhood playmates and the stages of their
friendship from 1973 to 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Working with Laurence Coriat, the gifted writer of 1999's
"Wonderland," Goldbacher has written rich roles for Anna Friel and
Michelle Williams, who excel under Goldbacher's intense direction.
"Me Without You" is so personal that it is not at all surprising that
Goldbacher drew from her own "best friendship" from age 11 to 17,
although in her film she moves well beyond the teens toward 40.</LD>
<LD>   Friel's Marina and Williams' Holly grew up living side by side in
a row of matching mock Tudor homes in suburban London. It's a case of
opposites attracting, for the two girls have very different
temperaments and backgrounds. Holly's parents are a solid, clearly
well-educated Jewish couple, Max (Allan Corduner) and Judith (Deborah
Findlay), who dote on their only child. Marina's rakish father, Ray
(Nicky Henson), is cavalier about his responsibilities, leaving her
mother, Linda (Trudie Styler), a party girl and an ex-croupier,
perilously despairing.</LD>
<TE>   Max is an ideal father, but Judith is compelled to instill in her
studious daughter that she is more clever than beautiful, which is
untrue. The instability of her family life has an enduring impact on
Marina, and Holly develops a crush on Marina's older brother Nat.</TE>
<TE>   When Friel, Williams and Oliver Milburn take over their roles from
the well-matched adolescent actors, their characters develop in
earnest. By the time Holly and Marina, who is now taking her fashion
cues from Madonna, are college roommates in an ancient seaside
Brighton flat, the pattern of their relationship is entrenched.
Marina is shamelessly manipulative, affectionately demonstrative,
alternately loving and cruel. But beneath her brazen ways she feels
she is nothing without Holly, who is becoming an independent-thinking
intellectual, while her friend says she would rather learn from life
than books.</TE>
<TE>   Friel dazzles with Marina's kaleidoscopic mood changes, which
shift as often as her hair color and style, while Williams underplays
to Friel in revealing Holly's growing need to break away from
Marina's possessiveness and to deal with her enduring love for Nat,
now a footloose musician captivated by a French actress (Marianne
Denicourt).</TE>
<TE>   As we jump to 1982 from 1978--the girls' college days--and on to
1989, Holly agonizes over her undying love for Nat. The big issue,
beyond the loosening of Marina's hold on her, is whether Holly and
Nat are ever going to get together or whether a relationship will
flower if they do. Holly's drawn-out predicament may smack of soap
opera, but not unrealistically.</TE>
<TE>   Goldbacher gives us a sense of a real friendship, strained by the
need of both women to mature, and embraces the emotional messiness of
growing up. Holly is slow but persistent in the process of maturing,
while Marina ultimately lets her friend go through it for both of
them. Milburn is appealing as Nat, who is as conflicted as Holly.
Kyle MacLachlan is droll as a seductive American professor whose
effect on both Holly and Marina proves more than he bargained for.</TE>
<TE>   "Me Without You" evokes its various periods deftly in changing
personal styles, enriched with an evocative soundtrack featuring
primarily '80s songs. The film is a more even and unified work than
"The Governess," which was set in the Victorian era. What Goldbacher
now needs to do is build upon her skill in directing and writing for
actors and complement her storytelling gifts with a bolder, more
distinctive visual style for greater overall impact.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language, sexual content and drug use. Times
guidelines: complex themes.</TE>

<HD>Tim Bavington Sprays Exuberant, Visual Music</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From across the room, the largest painting in a show of new work by
Tim Bavington at Mark Moore Gallery practically hollers, "Come look
at me!" The Las Vegas-based painter betrays no fear of being
flamboyant--and it's easy to see why: His art delivers.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-by-12-foot painting is titled "Aqualung (Solo)." Along with
the four other paintings and one drawing in the show, it continues an
excursion into musical analogy evidenced in Bavington's first
exhibition at the gallery two summers ago. Links between abstract art
and music are as old as abstraction itself, but at this late date
these paintings don't need the connection to provide justification
for eliminating recognizable subject matter. Instead, Bavington's
work amps up the ordinary rhythms of life into something fierce and
exuberant.</LD>
<LD>   "Aqualung (Solo)" is composed from intense acrylic hues--cherry
red, wisteria, lime, orange, sky blue, olive--that are often made
more dramatic through juxtaposition. Like the diving apparatus of the
title, the synthetic pigments extend the colors of nature--or, in the
pop words of the 1971 song by the eponymous Jethro Tull, "the flowers
bloom like madness in the spring"--allowing entrance into an alien
realm. The stripe painting brings forth rapture of the shallows.</LD>
<TE>   Bavington paints with a spray gun. Often one stripe is overlaid on
top of another. The vertical stripes are not taped, so the edges
fuzz. The reiteration of narrow vertical lines suggests mechanical
repetition; the longer you look, the more a pattern of broad bands of
color seems to anchor the wide expanse.</TE>
<TE>   Yet any attempt to decode a strict sequence or methodical
arrangement of colors will be defeated. Mechanical qualities are
enmeshed with fluid and organic ones. You scan the paintings at
random, and complex visual rhythms, feints, pauses and breaths
emerge.</TE>
<TE>   The show also includes two diptychs. "Hey Joe (Solo)" piles two
4-foot-square stripe canvases on top of each other, one all soft
pastels and the other loud and vibrant. "Babe, I'm Gonna Leave You
(Solo)" pairs horizontal canvases, the bottom one composed of stripes
in identical widths and the top one syncopated. A large drawing shows
how Bavington works out his compositions with pastels before pulling
out the spray gun.</TE>
<TE>   The diptychs struggle against themselves and don't yet feel
resolved. What really wails is the visual wall of sound in "Aqualung
(Solo)"--as well as in the slightly smaller "Crossroad Blues," which
is played in the complementary key of orange. Pump up the volume!</TE>

<TE>   Childlike Colors Render Adult Desires, Anxieties</TE>
<TE>   Has any painter ever employed a stranger palette than John
Wesley's? Born in L.A., the venerable New York artist uses the colors
of the nursery--pastel pink and baby blue--to render poster-like
images that embody decidedly adult desires and anxieties. The effect
is at once funny and creepy.</TE>
<TE>   At Daniel Weinberg Gallery, three paintings from the 1970s join
nine recent works on paper. The latter would appear to be studies for
paintings. In fact, several rework older canvases--making them
studies from paintings. Shuffling the expected sequence seems just
right for an artist who, for 40 years, has consistently painted adult
themes in kiddie colors.</TE>
<TE>   A chorus line of dancing female legs is chased by a spotted dog in
"Let's Get Out of the Hall" (1971). In 1976, "Woodrow Wilson Crossing
the Delaware with Sea Scouts" arrived just in time for America's
bicentennial. (Mixing up the presidents from Emmanuel Leutze's famous
painting is only half the fun, as Wesley also borrowed the Surrealist
downpour of raining figures from Magritte).</TE>
<TE>   "Afternoon Sail at the Edge of the World" (1978) transforms the
logo of a Kleenex box into a crashing ocean wave, while a small
lozenge of pink near the top becomes a forlorn boat on the suddenly
distant horizon.</TE>
<TE>   Wesley's pictographic style, in which flat colors are edged in
black, also uses repetition to comic effect. If one wide-eyed little
girl jumping for joy because "Daddy's Home" is disconcerting,
multiplying the figure by four transforms an exuberant domestic
episode into an inescapable horror. Wesley has a way of twisting
conventions into unexpected knots.</TE>
<TE>   Take "Leda and the Man," which performs a wild riff on a Greek
myth painted by countless Old Masters. In Wesley's world, Leda is not
the voluptuous woman who bore Helen of Troy after a liaison with Zeus
disguised as a swan. Here she seems to be the big white bird that
flees in terror from the advances of a balding, slightly portly man
with a mustache, who is dressed only in black socks and garters like
some Super 8 porn star. The cheerful image gives boisterously
entertaining new meaning to the lurid verb goose.</TE>
<TE>   "Camel" does the same for the idea of having a cigarette after
sex. "Cataract" mixes multiple meanings of the word--the clouding of
the lens of the eye plus a waterfall--but sticks the eye in the face
of a raucous cartoon duck and transforms the cascade into chorines'
legs dangling from his beak.</TE>
<TE>   Wesley is at his best when he pulls the rug out from beneath
expectations of rational comportment. There's nothing explicitly
vulgar in any of these works, yet all of them are bawdy for reasons
difficult to explain.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Weinberg Gallery, 6148 Wilshire Blvd., (323) 954-8425,
through July 20. Closed Sunday and Monday.</TE>

<TE>   Sculpting Fragments From Bits and Pieces</TE>
<TE>   Fragmentation has been a principal trait of sculpture since Rodin.
We tend to think of a fragment as something left over from absent
wholeness that lies beyond the reach of atomized contemporary
experience (and may, in fact, just be a myth). At Ace Gallery, Joel
Morrison plugs into this sculptural tradition, but in a rather
curious way.</TE>
<TE>   Morrison's abstract sculptures, which he collectively calls "heads
and torsos," approach fragmentation from the other direction: His
sculptures aren't bits and pieces left over from something presumed
to have once been whole; instead, they are fragments themselves,
built from bits and pieces--from other fragments cobbled together in
a precarious but lively way.</TE>
<TE>   Up on pedestals, most featuring a veneer of white Formica, the
mutant pseudo-heads and sort-of torsos appear forlorn but plucky.</TE>
<TE>   The show includes six sculptures, one of cast aluminum and five of
cast fiberglass. One is unpainted and glows with mottled
translucence; the rest are painted. The two most engaging works have
been further doused with runny pigments and bandaged with
multicolored gaffer tape; the stuffing seems to be coming out of
various protrusions, but they possess an animal grace.</TE>
<TE>   Most stand on knobby "feet," whose placement outlines the shape of
the pedestal on which they stand. The form billows up from there, so
it's a somewhat shaky perch. But the link between pedestal and object
is emphatic--Brancusi approached by way of eccentrics like Victor
Estrada and Saint Clair Cemin. These aspects of traditional sculpture
acknowledge the context of an art gallery, which, in a period awash
in anti-art, gives the battered fragments another witty spin.</TE>
<TE>   Morrison's first solo exhibition at Ace last year went in several
directions at once (it almost felt like a group show). This more
focused presentation picks one challenging path and follows
through--with impressive results.</TE>
<TE>   Ace Gallery, 5514 Wilshire Blvd., (323) 935-4411, through July 31.

<TE>   Familiar Commentary From Yoko Ono's Work</TE>
<TE>   Experiencing the world through the mediation of a camera's lens
has been a subject of inquiry for many artists since the 1960s,
including New York Conceptual artist Yoko Ono. A pedestrian show of
mostly recent work by Ono at Shoshana Wayne Gallery adds little to
the established repertoire.</TE>
<TE>   "From My Window: Rising (a)" is typical. A greeting-card poem
about nature's seasons, printed in the shape of a disk (think camera
lens), abuts three ink-jet prints on canvas.</TE>
<TE>   Ono's photographs repeat one image, although it grows
progressively darker from left to right: Mud-splashed eyeglasses and
a drinking glass half-full (or half-empty) of water rest side by side
on a polished table in front of a window. All types of glass--plus
transparency, reflection and other qualities of light--create
refracting lenses that alter our view.</TE>
<TE>   This familiar commentary reiterates territory outlined in a 1961
entry in her notebook, "Make a photograph in which the color only
comes out in a certain light, at a certain time of day," which Ono
transcribed in black ink on a small sheet of paper in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   It's on view with other notebook rewrites--instructions for
Conceptual works, the manner inspired by John Cage's method of
scoring musical events--presented here as drawings.</TE>
<TE>   Between 1961 and 1997, an instruction for a photograph that could
not be realized except in the mind came to be regarded as a material
object available for acquisition. What remains unchanged is an
uninspiring imagination.</TE>

<HD>Rebellion Pays Off for Warped Tour</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINA LECARO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since its inception in 1995, the Vans Warped Tour has tackled the
tricky task of celebrating punk rock's rebellious nature and, at the
same time, recognizing its commercial viability.</LD>
<LD>   It has largely succeeded, and though attempts at widening its
scope with metal, swing and even hip-hop over the years have met with
antagonism from purists, the music festival can claim credit for
helping break acts as varied as No Doubt, Limp Bizkit and even
Eminem.</LD>
<LD>   In the last few years, though, Warped has slowly been returning to
its hard-core roots, albeit with a decidedly cheerier bent. The 2002
tour, which hit the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for two days
starting Wednesday, typified this shift toward a more unruly
sensibility with a mash of fun-lovin' old favorites and some peppy
young newcomers.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, most of the unknown bands had difficulty making an
impact, as the smaller stages were placed much too close together,
making it hard to distinguish one group's bludgeoning beats from
another's. Still, amid the chaos and noise on the outskirts of the
stadium, a few sounds did manage to stand out, most notably the
old-school havoc of spiky-haired quartet the Casualties and the
expressive aggression of Home Grown and Glassjaw.</TE>
<TE>   It was the two main stages in the central area of the grounds to
which most of the young fans flocked. Warped alumni including the
Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Reel Big Fish (the only ska-flavored
acts), Lagwagon, NOFX, Good Charlotte and New Found Glory all kept
the crowd's attention and inspired nonstop pit action near the stage,
with the last two bands seemingly vying for the title of next year's
Blink-182.</TE>
<TE>   Highlights from the big stage area included Irish band Flogging
Molly's spirited set of infectious bar-brawling anthems and the
ever-tight melodic ferocity of longtime L.A. faves Bad Religion. The
former played just as the temperature started to cool and, with BMX
riders flying in the air behind them, provided a refreshing dose of
mutinous mayhem.</TE>
<TE>   Bad Religion, meanwhile, illustrated modern punk's full-circle
status. Indeed, it is the very combination of catchiness and
cacophony that they helped develop nearly two decades ago that has

<HD>Hidden Cameras Put an Unlikely Star in Focus</HD>
<DH>Television* Jeff Norman, self-described provocateur, is
featured on similar shows on two networks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Struggling actors and comics frequently complain that they can't get
arrested. Jeff Norman, who sees himself as technically neither but is
essentially a bit of both, not only could but literally did.</LD>
<LD>   Bearing some resemblance to Richard Deacon, who played Mel Cooley
on "The Dick Van Dyke Show," Norman hardly seems likely to become a
matinee idol, yet the current demand for titillating, inexpensive
television is such that he finds himself featured in two prime-time
programs on different networks--NBC's hidden-camera prank show "Spy
TV" and Fox's similar "Invasion of the Hidden Cameras," which debuts
tonight.</LD>
<LD>   "That officially makes me America's sweetheart," Norman said.</LD>
<TE>   Granted, the Fox series was produced a few years ago, before the
network stated its intent to curtail an overreliance on such fare
after embarrassing revelations about bachelor Rick Rockwell--who had
a restraining order against him obtained by an
ex-girlfriend--followed "Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?"</TE>
<TE>   A less heralded event, meanwhile, involved Norman himself, who was
arrested in Boise, Idaho, on charges of disturbing the peace while
perpetrating an elaborate hoax for a never-broadcast Fox special,
"World's Nastiest Neighbors."</TE>
<TE>   The 1998 stunt occurred when Norman and a crew leased a house on a
quiet cul-de-sac and proceeded to stage mud-wrestling matches in a
frontyard filled with 52 plastic pink flamingos, tiki torches and a
large trampoline.</TE>
<TE>   They invited perplexed neighbors over using a bullhorn and taped
their aghast reactions with, among other things, a miniature camera
inside a pair of oversized sunglasses.</TE>
<TE>   The charade lasted several days before concerned residents called
the police, who hauled Norman in and confiscated more than 30
videotapes.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see anything in there that's all that frightening, but
these people are very intolerant and uptight," Norman said recently,
adding, "I've never had handcuffs on before, and it hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Far from being humiliated, though, Norman considers Boise the apex
of his hidden-camera career.</TE>
<TE>   The deception, he noted, dragged on for several days--a departure
from most pranks, in which producers have only a few minutes before
they reveal the gag to get "marks" to sign a release form allowing
their images to be used. "People almost always sign," Norman said.</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, Norman's career is a rather strange one, including
documentary films, work for a now-defunct online entertainment site
and his latest project, a Pat Paulsen-like run for the presidency
built on a platform that includes a national "pizza night," extending
summer by two weeks and making procreation "a privilege."</TE>
<TE>   Norman's agent, Richard Lawrence, hopes there is a TV special or
series in documenting the presidential run, which Norman, at least,
appears to be taking seriously. Even Lawrence struggles in trying to
characterize him.</TE>
<TE>   "He just looks at life differently," Lawrence said, adding in
regard to the way the TV landscape has shifted, "There's a need for
people doing unusual things."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm definitely not an actor," Norman said. "I never really knew
what to call myself. A provocateur, I guess.... I've always enjoyed
interacting with the unsuspecting public."</TE>
<TE>   Although rarely as protracted as what he tried to pull off in
Boise, the hidden-camera pranks Norman specializes in are clearly
less innocuous than, say, "Candid Camera."</TE>
<TE>   A "Spy TV" stunt, for example, involved getting pizza deliverymen
to help perform a mock surgery (although they didn't know it wasn't
real) in a seedy motel room. One became so unnerved at the grisly
spectacle that he abruptly exited through the window.</TE>
<TE>   Some have decried this programming trend as being mean-spirited,
among them Peter Funt, son of the late Allen Funt and overseer of the
"Candid Camera" franchise. Still, hidden-camera shows have
proliferated, including the WB's comedic "JKX: The Jamie Kennedy
Experiment," Fox's upcoming "Meet the Marks" and MTV's "Celebrity
Undercover."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Norman dismisses any criticism, suggesting that the
public accepts and understands that the shows are designed simply to
entertain. As for the risk that someone could be hurt, he said, "I
didn't expect anybody to jump out a window, and I don't think any
reasonable person would."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Boggs, the executive producer of "Spy TV," said Norman and
the program's other regular contributors possess the improvisational
skills necessary to make the genre work--unlike many of the more
traditional sitcom actors who come in.</TE>
<TE>   "He's probably the furthest thing in Hollywood from a leading
man--kind of a cross between Gavin MacLeod and Chris Elliott,"
quipped Boggs, who previously worked on Tom Green's MTV show and who
calls Norman a friend.</TE>
<TE>   As for the prospects of a TV show chronicling Norman's
transformation from unlikely TV presence to presidential candidate,
his agent expressed confidence someone will eventually take the
plunge. After all, it should be unusual--and reasonably priced.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we'll get to do it," Lawrence said. "Like everything else
in TV, it's just a question of when."</TE>

<LD>   Whitney Can't Wait to Get Her Point Across</LD>
<LD>   Whitney Houston's new single, "Watcha Lookin' At," has been leaked
to New York radio stations behind the backs of Arista Records
executives, the Fox News Channel reports. Executives at the company
were said to be more than a bit flustered because finishing touches
are still being put on the untitled, long-awaited album, scheduled
for release Sept. 17. Houston's last album of all-new material was
released in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   On the cut, which Houston co-wrote with Atlanta producers Andrew
Lewis and Jerry Mohammed, the singer takes a broad swipe at the press
and others who have had a field day chronicling her turbulent
personal life. In a nutshell: She tells everyone else to get a life
so she can get on with hers.</TE>
<TE>   Arista insiders told Fox that they probably will not take legal
action in reaction to the premature release.</TE>

<TE>   Rubens Sale Sets Records in London</TE>
<TE>   "The Massacre of the Innocents," a recently discovered painting by
the Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens, sold Wednesday for $76.2
million--the third-highest price ever paid for a painting and the
highest for one by an Old Master, Sotheby's auction house in London
said.</TE>
<TE>   Painted between 1609 and 1611, the piece was only positively
identified a few weeks ago, when the owner took it to a specialist at
the auction house for examination. For more than 200 years, the
owners believed it to be the work of artist Jan van den Hoecke.</TE>
<TE>   The sum, paid by an unidentified private collector, smashed the
expected price of $9 million, said Alexander Bell, head of Sotheby's
Old Master paintings department. Bell said the price was more than
double what previously had been paid for a work by an Old Master,
which includes the 17th century Dutch painters Jan van Eyck, Rubens
and Rembrandt. Although one of the bidders is believed to have been
Los Angeles' J. Paul Getty Museum, a spokesman for the institution
said it does not comment on potential acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   The painting, a depiction of the moment when King Herod ordered
the slaughter of all newborn boys to get rid of the Messiah, is also
said to be the most expensive painting ever sold at an auction in
London--surpassing the record that was held by Vincent van Gogh's
"Sunflowers," which sold in 1987 for $35 million.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, it is the third-most-expensive painting ever sold at
auction, behind Van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet," sold by
Christie's in New York for $82.5 million in 1990, and Pierre-Auguste
Renoir's "Au Moulin de la Galette," sold by Sotheby's in New York for
$78 million the same year.</TE>
<TE>   OPERA</TE>
<TE>   Gilfry Withdraws From Santa Fe Production</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles baritone and rising opera star Rodney Gilfry has
withdrawn from Tchaikovsky's "Eugene Onegin" at the Santa Fe Opera,
following reports of vocal difficulty.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps because he tried to reflect 'Onegin's' stiffness in voice
as well as body, perhaps because this was his debut in the part,
Gilfry did not sing well," wrote Craig Smith in a review of the
opera's June 28 opening that ran in the Sante Fe New Mexican. "Some
moments were better than others, but many were worse. The question
is, can the baritone master the role or will it continue to master
him?"</TE>
<TE>   "His condition worsened as the evening wore on," wrote Olin Chism
in the Dallas Morning News, "and by the final scene he was close to
losing his voice. At one point he dropped out entirely--or perhaps it
was a matter of a loud orchestra covering softly sung notes."</TE>
<TE>   Gilfry sang the title role in the opera, which is part of Santa
Fe's two-month summer opera festival, one more time, on July 2, but
his understudy, Nicolai Janitzky, sang July 6 and is scheduled to
perform tonight as well. Scott Hendricks, who made his Santa Fe Opera
debut last summer, will sing the final five performances.</TE>
<TE>   "I am extremely disappointed to be leaving this extraordinary
company and my fellow cast members," Gilfry said, announcing his
departure Thursday. "But I feel it is in everyone's best interest if
I withdraw at this time."</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Larry Elder's local KABC-AM talk radio show will go national
through a syndication deal with ABC Radio Networks starting Aug. 12,
according to the Hollywood Reporter....Des McAnuff, artistic director
of the La Jolla Playhouse, has been selected to direct the "first
officially licensed and sanctioned live theatrical multimedia stage
production celebrating Frank Sinatra," according to Frank Sinatra
Enterprises and Radio City Entertainment. Tina Sinatra is executive
producing.... Talk show host Jerry Springer has been sued by Jeffrey
Campbell, son of a guest who was killed by her ex-husband shortly
after their "love-triangle" episode aired. The show created a "mood
that led to murder," Cambell claimed...."The Price is Right" host Bob
Barker underwent prostate surgery Wednesday at George Washington
University Hospital in Washington. Barker, 78, is expected to make a
full recovery...."Big Brother 3" premiered to solid ratings Wednesday
with an estimated 9.2 million viewers--edging out the 9 million
watching Fox's "American Idol."</TE>

<HD>In Trouble the Moment They Open Their Mouths</HD>
<DH>Jeffrey Tambor and Jill Clayburgh are well teamed for
'Never Again,' only to be given a crude script.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With "Never Again" New York independent filmmaker Eric Schaeffer
successfully teams Jeffrey Tambor and Jill Clayburgh in a middle-aged
romance between a pair of wary divorces, only to shoot them down with
some of the most tasteless dialogue ever spoken in a mainstream
movie. Since Schaeffer has among his credits the effective offbeat
romantic comedies "Wirey Spindell" and "Fall," one has to wonder what
he was thinking.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is not the use of four-letter words and crude sex talk
in themselves; it is the context. It is simply not credible that
people of the intelligence of Tambor's Christopher and Clayburgh's
Grace would speak in this manner. Schaeffer has confused an entirely
appropriate sexual candor with flagrant crudity, and the effect has
an uncomfortable aura of self-consciousness. The result is
unfortunate, to say the least: Youthful audiences won't be attracted
to a love story between two 54-year-olds in the first place, and
mature audiences will be turned off by the language, not necessarily
out of prudishness, but out of its sheer crassness.</LD>
<TE>   Christopher continues his late father's exterminator business and
plays jazz piano at a Greenwich Village bar with his bassist pal,
Earl (Bill Duke). Christopher is a massively built guy grown bald,
paunchy and cranky. He has little contact with his 31-year-old son,
from a one-year marriage, who now lives in Montana. Christopher's
love life seems to have been confined to one-night stands, but the
latest, with a 25-year-old who, rather amazingly, picked him up, has
found him impotent for the first time. If that wasn't bad enough, his
date tells him she thinks he's bisexual.</TE>
<TE>   He then has a nightmare in which he successfully has sex with a
young man and awakens so shaken he feels compelled to seek out a
transsexual hooker (Michael McKean) to find out if what his date said
might be true. When he can't deal with what he encounters, he heads
for a gay bar, where, rather improbably, to say the least, a young
man (Dan'l Linehan) comes on to him. But Christopher's crude sexual
request turns the man off.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Grace, who has been divorced a decade and made
lonely by her daughter's departure for college, enters the same gay
bar with her best friends (Caroline Aaron and Sandy Duncan), who have
urged to her to try Internet dating. Grace has been stood up--why her
blind date selected a gay bar as a meeting place remains a
mystery--and she and Christopher cross paths in the bar, where he
assumes she must be a transsexual.</TE>
<TE>   This 10-minute opening sequence is as contrived and protracted as
it sounds, and it makes Christopher look needlessly clumsy and naive.
(There's a similar sequence in which Grace goes to a sex toy shop,
which has subsequent consequences more ludicrous than amusing.) In
any event, Christopher and Grace click, especially when both insist
that they are looking for a relationship but that they never again
will fall in love.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, they do anyway, and the way it leaves them shaken and
fearful of trusting one another is entirely credible and played
beautifully by Tambor and Clayburgh, whom Schaeffer met when he had a
small part in his stars' 1991 sitcom pilot "Everything's Relative," a
series that lasted only four episodes.</TE>
<TE>   But so much of "Never Again" is cringe-inducing that Tambor and
Clayburgh cannot overcome such defects. That the opportunities to
depict romance in middle age on the big screen are so few and far
between makes "Never Again's" gratuitous lapses all the more
lamentable.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong sexual content, including graphic
dialogue, and for language. Times guidelines: wholly unsuitable for
children.</TE>

<HD>Le Gray, an Ingenious Photography Pioneer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 150 years before computer software made it easy to meld
elements from more than one photograph into a single picture, Gustave
Le Gray (1820-1884) used nothing but his wits and a handful of
beautifully exposed negatives to do the same thing. In 1856-57, he
made a series of stunning seascapes by splicing together pairs of
negatives, one for the sky and one for the water.</LD>
<LD>   Until then, the long exposures required to get enough light on the
water (or land) left the sky overexposed--dull, leaden and gray. Many
photographers painted this part of their negatives black, resulting
in prints whose skies were blank white. Some used tiny brushes to
paint clouds on their negatives, causing the skies in their
photographs to look as fake as theatrical backdrops.</LD>
<LD>   Le Gray's solution, sometimes called the patched-in-sky procedure,
allowed for every square inch of the photograph to be perfectly
exposed. Four of these ingenious prints are among the many highlights
of "Gustave Le Gray, Photographer," a 100-work survey that was
organized by the Bibliotheque National de France in Paris and is now
on view at the J. Paul Getty Museum.</LD>
<TE>   Hung side by side, "Seascape With a Ship Leaving Port" and "Large
Wave, Mediterranean Sea" reveal that the inventive Frenchman was not
opposed to using the same sky twice. Each shows the same oddly shaped
cluster of clouds drifting over a different body of water.</TE>
<TE>   On the left in the gallery, a single-mast ship and the mouth of a
harbor are silhouetted by bright sunlight that ricochets off a choppy
sea. The fractured reflections give the water's surface the sheen and
luster of roughly sculpted glass. Clouds hug the horizon, blocking a
direct view of the sun and casting the sky in velvety shadows.</TE>
<TE>   On the right, the same clouds float over calmer waters, whose
smaller waves gently lap the shore of an inlet. Higher in the sky and
less darkly printed, they lack the somber weight of their
counterparts and evoke a more tranquil mood.</TE>
<TE>   Even if these gorgeous photographs were not juxtaposed, you'd
still notice that something out of the ordinary takes place within
them. Anyone who has seen a sunset knows that the brightest
reflections in the water form a shimmering line between your eyes and
the sun. In both of Le Gray's pictures, these reflections do not lead
your gaze back to the sun. In "Seascape With Ship," it's far off to
the right of where it should be. In "Large Wave," the center of the
solar system is less dramatically out of position. Both images put a
delicious kink in everyday perceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Although Le Gray's photographs are factually inaccurate, they're
artistically brilliant. In each, he has created a subtly dynamic
composition whose visual impact and emotional resonance are far more
compelling than any straightforward recording of what he actually saw
would be, especially if printed from a single negative.</TE>
<TE>   These fascinating images also stand out because they mark one of
the rare occasions when Le Gray was able to balance the practical
requirements of making a living with his artistic ambitions.
Combining technical finesse and brooding romanticism, they captured
his restless imagination. Plus, they sold well, received critical
acclaim and established his reputation as one of the most famous
photographers of his time.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Le Gray's success didn't last. From the height of
his fame in the late 1850s, he suddenly fell into obscurity--and then
disappeared into oblivion. The rest of the exhibition tells a tragic
tale of a life torn in two by the competing demands of commerce and
creativity.</TE>
<TE>   An introductory gallery sets the stage by introducing viewers to
Le Gray, his studio and the friends, benefactors and colleagues with
whom he worked. A self-portrait shows him to be a handsome
32-year-old who exudes nonchalant self-confidence, seductive charm
and devilish recklessness. If Central Casting were looking for a
modern Mephistopheles, they'd be thrilled to see this self-possessed
man seated on a simple stool before a bare backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Le Gray's "Portrait of O. Mestral" depicts a puffy,
sullen man whose furrowed brow and pinched expression suggest a
delicate sensibility traumatized by the tumult of modern life. A
former student of Le Gray's, this mysterious figure (about whom
almost nothing is known) collaborated with him on a series of
photographs featured in the next gallery. It's hard to imagine them
having anything in common, much less traveling together all over
France to complete their government job.</TE>
<TE>   Another photograph in the introductory gallery portrays Le Gray's
best friend, Henri Le Secq, who with Le Gray studied painting in the
studio of Paul Delaroche. In 1843, Delaroche left Paris for Rome. Le
Gray followed on foot, walking through the Alps in the summer and
arriving in December. By May, he was married to his Roman landlady's
daughter, Palmira Maddalena Gertrude Leonardi, with whom he had at
least six children over the next 13 years. The couple moved to Paris
in 1847.</TE>
<TE>   Several views of Le Gray's studio on the outskirts of the city
show the setting in which he painted, made photographs and wrote a
four-volume treatise on photography. The breadth of his talents as a
photographer are indicated by the range of his subjects: nudes,
street musicians, panoramic views of Montmartre (when it was a
windmill-dotted farmland) and commissioned portraits of such notable
clients as Napoleon III and his wife, the Empress Eugenie. All of Le
Gray's images are printed with the care and devotion of someone who
demands excellence but isn't stymied by the obsessions of a
perfectionist.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the next two galleries includes two types of work:
commissioned series and ones he made on his own. The first of these
rooms is equally divided between images of cultural monuments Le Gray
and Mestral made for the French government and views of the forest of
Fontainebleau he created for himself.</TE>
<TE>   The purpose of the state-sponsored photographs was to document the
condition of churches, castles, historic bridges and ancient
fortifications so that an ambitious restoration program could be
undertaken. The photographers had different ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   While they fulfilled their obligations by making crisp, clear
pictures, their desire to make art out of their mundane assignment is
palpable. Using the facades of Romanesque churches, the cloisters of
cathedrals, the roofs of Renaissance pavilions and the ramparts and
towers of the medieval city of Carcassonne as their raw materials,
they created elaborately balanced compositions filled with poetic
effects. Sometimes they treated the buildings like still-lifes, and
at others like abstract arrangements of light and shadow.</TE>
<TE>   On his own in the forest of Fontainebleau, Le Gray experimented
with various techniques and materials, transforming the trees and the
sun-dappled paths through them into exquisite images. The
mysteriousness of the woods suffuses every texture, tone and shape in
his highly refined pictures.</TE>
<TE>   The next gallery pairs Le Gray's photographs of the French army's
summer training camp (commissioned by Emperor Napoleon III) with his
potent seascapes, which steal the show (and include his
patched-in-sky prints). The portraits of officers, infantrymen at
rest and vast panoramas of cavalry in action are interesting for
historical, not artistic reasons. They pale in comparison to Le
Gray's seascapes, some of which focus on the natural drama of
sunlight, water and clouds, and others that include ships, coasts and
harbors to amplify their evocative power.</TE>
<TE>   The works in the final gallery are divided by a pivotal trip Le
Gray took in 1860. In 1859, deeply indebted to creditors who had
invested in a studio and workshop he had neglected for nearly a
decade, Le Gray made a series of postcard-like pictures of Parisian
monuments and street scenes. But before he printed large editions of
these classically composed pictures of such highlights as Notre Dame,
Place de la Concorde, the Louvre and various views of the Seine, he
joined Alexandre Dumas on a yacht trip around the Mediterranean. The
idea was that Le Gray would make photographs to accompany the stories
Dumas wrote about the ancient civilizations they visited. Plans
changed in Sicily, when the author, who had just completed "The Count
of Monte Cristo," decided to run guns for Giuseppe Garibaldi, who was
fighting to liberate the island from Bourbon rule. An argument
ensued, and Dumas put Le Gray ashore on Malta.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than returning to France, where he would have faced
debtors' prison and a deserted wife, the photographer began a life of
exile. Aside from a few legal documents, his photographs are all that
remain from the last 24 years of his life. Flashes of brilliance
appear in his pictures of war-damaged buildings in Palermo,
archeological excavations in Lebanon (where he worked as a
photojournalist) and more ruins in Egypt (where he taught drawing to
the sons of the ruling viceroy). But Le Gray's late works have a
hit-and-miss quality, which is partly due to his inability to work in
sustained series.</TE>
<TE>   In Cairo, he died in poverty with a 20-year-old Greek lover and
newborn baby at his side. For the next century, Le Gray's work was
known only to specialists, and mostly as an academic footnote.</TE>
<TE>   But over the last 20 years, interest by historians and collectors
has grown exponentially and Le Gray is now considered France's most
important 19th century photographer. A movie must be in the works.</TE>

<HD>Where's St. George When You Need Him?</HD>
<DH>Domineering dragons, not overacting humans, are the real
class act in the silly 'Reign of Fire.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dragons have the best lines in "Reign of Fire," and they don't say a
word. All they have to do is breathe.</LD>
<LD>   Taking a year in post-production to come to life, the fire
snorters in this futuristic story are admirable creatures, way more
convincing than the puny humans arrayed against them. When they open
their mouths, we pay attention, which is not necessarily the case
with anyone else.</LD>
<LD>   Set in your standard post-apocalyptic future, "Reign of Fire's"
notion of what that catastrophe was is a novel one. As posited by
Gregg Chabot &amp; Kevin Peterka (who wrote the screenplay with Matt
Greenberg), a race of dragons has been asleep under the earth for
longer than the vampire Lestat, taking their ease after munching on
just about everything edible on the planet.</LD>
<TE>   Accidentally awakened with hearty appetites in today's London, the
dragons (as detailed in a clever "The End" issue of Time magazine
used as a prologue) take about a decade to ravage the world. It's war
between them and us and, as someone says, "only one species is
getting out of this alive."</TE>
<TE>   The film proper opens in a ruined castle in Northumberland in the
year 2020, when humanity is at a low ebb and the world's remaining
people, such as they are, have divided themselves into hunters and
gatherers.</TE>
<TE>   The chief gatherer is Quinn (Christian Bale), who as a boy had a
hand in awakening the beast. His group of ragtag survivalists has no
greater goal than to hang on and hope the dragons starve. Meanwhile,
Quinn and second-in-command Creedy (an appealing Gerard Butler) put
on amusing "Star Wars" dramatizations for the clan's kids.</TE>
<TE>   Tank commander Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey) has other ideas. A
U.S. military man ("the only thing worse than dragons is Americans"
is the feeling in the castle), he's an "I lead, you follow" kind of
zealot whose eyes are so wide they seem to be held open by
toothpicks.</TE>
<TE>   Van Zan shows up brimming with notions about how to take the fight
to the dragons, but Quinn is not so sure. Still, he can't take his
eyes off Alex ("Vertical Limit's" Izabella Scorupco), Van Zan's ace
helicopter pilot who just might be the last attractive blond on the
planet.</TE>
<TE>   Though "Reign of Fire's" concept of a humans-versus-dragons
smackdown is a good one, the way it's worked out on screen is more
silly than compelling. The script is of the pedestrian "we have paid
a terrible price and now we have a chance to make a difference"
variety, and Rob Bowman, who directed "The X-Files" movie and many TV
episodes, is better at handling the computer-generated dragon than
the film's fallible actors. Think Kevin Costner's "The Postman," not
"Mad Max."</TE>
<TE>   If Bale is simply unconvincing as the sporadically mighty Quinn,
McConaughey is so excessive as super-macho Van Zan he seems like a
graduate of Jon Voight's Anaconda School of Acting. Yes, he's bulked
up and tattooed; yes, he chomps on a cigar and frequently snarls,
"Lock and load"; but this character is about as threatening as a GQ
model. With the world's very existence at stake, why the film has
sent in the JV hero team is anyone's guess.</TE>
<TE>   Still, no one but the performers' family and friends will be
coming to "Reign of Fire" for the acting. It's the dragons,
supervised by visual effects heads Richard Hoover and Dan DeLeeuw and
animated by Disney's now-shuttered the Secret Lab, that carry the
picture.</TE>
<TE>   With enormous wingspans and nasty, lizard-like bodies, able to
incinerate large areas and swallow humans in a single tasty gulp, the
dragons are creatures of a certain creepy elegance as well as
undeniable potency. Even lifeless, they command our respect; it's not
every film that has a "dead dragon designed and built by" credit, and
Artem Ltd. has certainly earned it. It's worth putting up with a lot
of nonsense to see these compelling creatures do their worst.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for intense action violence. Times guidelines:
The dragons are quite frightening.</TE>

<HD>A Rebirth for Latino Museum</HD>
<DH>Art* The L.A. facility has a new temporary home and is
paying down old debts as it refocuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the last four years, leaders of the Latino Museum of History, Art
and Culture have gained and lost a location, slipped deep into red
ink and struggled to survive without a staff. Now, however, board
members say they've cleared nearly $500,000 in debts as the first
step of a "new beginning" that includes a temporary downtown
exhibition space and educational programming with an Internet
emphasis.</LD>
<LD>   Before their next major decisions--choosing a new site and hiring
a top executive--board members say they will draw on advice and
funding from several leading cultural organizations that until now
haven't been tapped by the fledgling institution.</LD>
<LD>   "We're starting with a clean piece of paper and trying to find the
best solutions," said Stan Sosa, vice president of the museum's board
of trustees and president of the digital-content company Trifecta
Content Group Inc.</LD>
<TE>   With a permanent collection of fewer than 40 paintings, no
full-time permanent staff, no high-profile donors and a board of
trustees that has been dominated by professors and university
administrators, the museum has struggled to find a niche, despite its
status as the only institution of its kind in a major city whose
population is more than 40% Latino. As the Los Angeles institution
has struggled, the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach opened
in 1996 and is now raising funds for an expansion.</TE>
<TE>   The Latino Museum's new space (201 N. Los Angeles St., Suite 2),
former home of the now-relocated city Ethics Commission, includes
about 6,000 square feet and stands next to the L.A. Mall's food
court, one story beneath street level. The space is open
(Mondays-Saturdays, 10 a.m.-4 p.m.), but the museum will formally
inaugurate it Aug. 3 with the opening of a retrospective exhibition
of paintings and drawings by Chicano artist Ramses Noriega.</TE>
<TE>   Foremost among the board's new advisors is Belin Consulting, a
management consulting company specializing in nonprofits. The
company's founder, Daniel Belin, is an attorney who serves on the
boards of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the L.A.
Philharmonic. Latino Museum officials said they'll rely on reports
from Belin in assembling a business plan and deciding other
strategies.</TE>
<TE>   Among the funding sources that will pay for the consultant's work
are the J. Paul Getty Trust, which in late June approved a grant of
$35,000 for organizational planning; the James Irvine Foundation,
which in March approved a similar grant for $25,000; and the
California Community Foundation, which is expected to approve a
$10,000 grant in coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Latino museum will continue to count on a
$1-million state grant approved by the Legislature during the
2000-2001 fiscal year. That grant, aimed at teacher training,
educational programming and capital outlays, is to be used this year
and in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The Latino Museum's genesis came with fund-raising efforts begun
in the late 1980s by founder Charles Calderon (a Democratic state
senator from Whittier from 1990 to 1998). It opened as a downtown
exhibition space in 1998, with Calderon serving as board chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Operating in a building donated by the Bank of America, the
organization drew most of its funding from Sacramento rather than
private donors and had little interaction with the city, county and
state agencies that traditionally evaluate museums and make arts
grants. (It remains unaccredited by the Washington, D.C.-based
American Assn. of Museums.)</TE>
<TE>   Late in 2000, amid canceled exhibitions and claims of unpaid staff
salaries and other bills, the museum closed and its board accepted
Calderon's resignation and appointed several new members.</TE>
<TE>   The museum, which remained closed through 2001, reopened in
February with a photography exhibition about Mexicans of African
heritage (which will remain on display in the new space through the
end of this month), but the institution's future on Main Street was
doomed by the city's downtown redevelopment ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   Under a pact between the city and the state, Caltrans agreed to
put up a new Los Angeles headquarters building on the block of Main
Street where the Latino museum stood. Forced out by city condemnation
actions, the museum's board agreed to vacate and sell the 112 S. Main
St. location in May. The building was leveled earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Under its agreement with the city--part of which is still under
negotiation, as the museum seeks more compensation--the Latino
Museum's board got $2.9 million for its building, plus a year's
rent-free stay in the city-owned Los Angeles Mall. Even before that
check came in, board President Juan Gomez-Quinones said, the
institution had begun paying off debts. Now, he said, the remaining
debts are down to "a few thousand dollars" owed to a handful of
creditors that the museum is still trying to locate.</TE>
<TE>   Among the creditors were a dozen former employees seeking back
wages. Representing them, Edna Garcia Earley, a staff attorney for
the California Labor Commissioner, filed suit in Los Angeles County
Superior Court last November seeking unpaid wages earned between May
and September 2000. On May 22, Garcia said, the Latino Museum's board
ended the dispute by paying $196,275.17 in wages and penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Another creditor was Roberto "Tito" Delgado, the artist who
designed the museum's Main Street concrete facade in 1997. Delgado
said the museum had owed him about $2,000 for more than four years,
then paid him several months ago. But he remains wary of the
organization.</TE>
<TE>   "If this was a corporation, I certainly wouldn't invest in it,"
said Delgado. (Delgado's facade was demolished with his permission
after it was determined that the cost of moving it would be
prohibitive.)</TE>
<TE>   Gomez-Quinones said other paid-off creditors include a security
company, a catering company and a printing company, each of which was
owed "tens of thousands of dollars."</TE>
<TE>   The museum trustees also said they're lining up arrangements for
satellite exhibition spaces that might also include educational
programs, probably in the San Fernando Valley and East Los Angeles.
In addition, they have hired four teachers and a Web-content company
to produce a "distance learning" curriculum based on Latin American
art history. The first of eight major themes, "Earth in Latin
American Art," is to appear on the museum Web site, www.thelatino
museum.org, when it is launched in September.</TE>
<TE>   The museum's board of trustees expanded its membership from seven
to nine in June with the addition of educator Armida Ornelas, of East
Los Angeles College, and artist Harry Gamboa Jr. In the next year,
Gomez-Quinones said, the board expects to add at least two more
members.</TE>

<HD>Looking After 'Children of the Court'</HD>
<DH>A Discovery Channel documentary tracks youths through Los
Angeles' overloaded oversight system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes, it takes a legal system to raise a child.</LD>
<LD>   That is one of the saddest commentaries on the state of society in
the U.S., and especially Los Angeles, as demonstrated by "Children of
the Court," tonight at 8 on the Discovery Channel.</LD>
<LD>   But it's happening underneath our noses in mind-reeling numbers:
There are more than 50,000 children under the jurisdiction of the
L.A. County Dependency Court, a branch of the Superior Court.</LD>
<TE>   These kids have committed no crime; instead, they were unlucky
enough to be born to parents who have abandoned, abused or neglected
them to the point that authorities intervene.</TE>
<TE>   They are youths such as Rocky, a 14-year-old boy and one of three
children profiled on tonight's hourlong documentary. He came to the
court's attention at age 10 1/2, when a doughnut shop owner noticed
him loitering. His mother had never sent him to school, so he hadn't
learned to read or write. After she'd abandoned him, he says, he
didn't know where he was from or what his birthday was.</TE>
<TE>   Or they could be youngsters such as Rolonda, 17, who was taken
away because authorities said her mother was abusing drugs. Her aunt
began raising her, but the aunt died. She bounced around from
relative to relative, landing eventually in a foster family. All was
going as well as could be expected, until she was diagnosed with
cancer. Then she was removed from her foster family at one point
because it didn't have the special license required to raise a
seriously ill child.</TE>
<TE>   Or they could be like young Dakota, whose mother's boyfriend glued
his lips together to shut him up, according to Lila Barrios, the aunt
who adopted him.</TE>
<TE>   Shot in a spartan, almost amateurish style, "Children of the
Court" begins a bit tediously. But five minutes into the program, the
heartbreaking individual stories emerge, through the words of the
children and those left to protect their interests--judges, lawyers,
foster parents and volunteer court-appointed special advocates known
as CASAs.</TE>
<TE>   The film, directed by Chuck Braverman, goes inside courtrooms to
reveal the wrenching but hopeful decisions being made in a hopelessly
overloaded system.</TE>
<TE>   "What's important is that he feels that he has a future,"
Dependency Court Referee Sherri Sobel says of Rocky.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the only thing that's important, that he knows there are
people who care about him, that we care about him here, that his CASA
cares about him, his lawyer cares about him. And it may not be the
same thing as having parents who care about him, but it's the next
best thing."</TE>
<TE>   "Children of the Court" will be shown tonight at 8 and repeated at
11 on the Discovery Channel.</TE>

<HD>Plans for Douglas Theatre Adjusted</HD>

<LD>Cost issues have forced the Center Theatre Group to drop plans for a
100-seat stage at its proposed Kirk Douglas Theatre in Culver City.
The smaller space was to have supplemented the facility's primary
320-seat auditorium.</LD>
<LD>   The project, announced earlier this year, involves the renovation
of the interior of the Culver Theater, a cinema that was opened in
1947, and the original plan called for the existing structure's
balcony area to be used as a smaller stage. But architects discovered
that the floor of the balcony could not be lowered enough to provide
an adequate space for the theater without extensive structural
changes that "would have been out of anyone's financial ballpark,"
said Charles Dillingham, CTG's managing director.</LD>
<LD>   As it is, the estimated cost of the project, which will provide
facilities for play development and youth programming, has risen to
$10.9 million from the original estimate of $7 million to $8 million.
Dillingham said the architects' recently completed schematic plans
allowed a more accurate cost estimate. "It often occurs that early
estimates are not correct," he said. About $7 million of the total
has been raised, including $2.5 million from actor Kirk Douglas and
his wife, Anne.</LD>
<TE>   Under the latest plans, Dillingham said, the balcony area will be
used as a rehearsal space and classroom after the scheduled 2004
opening of the facility. Public programs that would have been held in
the 100-seat space will be held in the 320-seat theater instead.
Meanwhile, Center Theatre Group and the Culver City Redevelopment
Agency are planning to use the 99-seat Ivy Substation, a few blocks
from the Culver Theatre, as the site of such activities as the Mark
Taper Forum's New Work Festival until the Douglas Theatre opens.</TE>
<TE>   CTG will lease the Ivy Substation from October 2002 until June
2004 and will spend $186,000 to upgrade the sound, lighting and
seating, plus monthly costs estimated at $8,000 to $9,000 for
utilities and maintenance, said Steven Rose, a Culver City
Redevelopment Agency board member and City Council member. The
redevelopment agency will spend $211,000 for structural modifications
at the Ivy. The agency also will occupy the Ivy with local
activities, not related to CTG, in July and August 2003. Dillingham
said final details on the Ivy deal are expected to be ironed out
later this summer.</TE>

<HD>Language Is 'Voice of the Hero's' Star</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Understanding upfront that language itself occupies center stage is
enormously helpful preparation for approaching Natalie Avital's "The
Voice of the Hero" at the upstairs Flight Theatre of the Complex in
Hollywood. The show's strengths and limitations are defined as much
by Avital's writing--an impassioned fusion of rap and traditional
poetry--as they are by conventional stagecraft.</LD>
<LD>   Dual casting from the ranks of an artistically ambitious but young
ensemble introduces a random element of performance quality, and puts
the focus even more on the message than its delivery.</LD>
<LD>   Further strengthening its affinity with the spoken word, the
evening warms up with an intense half-hour pre-show recital by either
Steven Connell or Greg Crooks.</LD>
<TE>   Within the thin but serviceable framework of a late-night talk
radio show, Avital has scripted a moody octet for the voices of
loners and misfits who call in to bounce their deepest secrets off
the compulsively rhyming DJ Jeff (Josh Covitt).</TE>
<TE>   Don't look for realism here--we know right off that this all takes
place in some alternate talk-radio universe because no one blames
former President Clinton for anything. Instead, the callers follow
Jeff's mocking exhortation to "self-kiss your wounds with an ice
cream tongue" in a series of sometimes evocative, sometimes tedious
monologues.</TE>
<TE>   The principal caller is Mark (Matthew Harris), a surprisingly
thoughtful and eloquent street hustler unexpectedly forced to
confront his own mortality. Having attracted something of a following
through his frequent calls, Mark is the ostensible reference point
for the other characters, who, in commenting on his situation, turn
him into a projector screen for their interior dramas.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Mark dismisses a belligerent religious fanatic
(Brian Lennon) as "just another ugly voice on the radio"--but it's a
distinction without significance in a category that applies equally
to the entire menagerie on display here.</TE>
<TE>   In this predominantly static cycle of voices, the limited dramatic
arc involves our realization that Jeff is more central to the action
than his detached commentator role at first suggests.</TE>
<TE>   But the atmosphere of relentless brooding dampens any sense of
real movement, with only the periodic visitations from a mystical
feminine archetype (Hilary Hesse, sharing the role with Avital)
hinting at the possibility of transcendental peace.</TE>
<TE>   What this work--or at least this viewer--cries out for is to vary
the tone with some levity.</TE>

<TE>   'The Years' Aims to Be Modern Chekhov</TE>
<TE>   "The Years," receiving its local premiere as the inaugural
offering of the UNITAS Theatre Company, begins with heroine Andrea
(Michelle Correa) being mugged en route to her wedding. Her assailant
(Terik Guindy), more significant than initially apparent, expresses
pointed remorse even while absconding with the money.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, preparations are bustling at Andrea's Minneapolis home,
courtesy of take-charge cousin Isabella (Renee DeBevoise) and her
sensitive sibling Andrew (Andrew Salamone). This parallel pair voice
concern over Andrea and her sister Eloise (Nikki Braendlin),
considering the recent loss of the sisters' parents. Next, Eloise
discovers husband Jeffrey (Greg James) is philandering, barely
digesting this before Andrea's bruised arrival.</TE>
<TE>   That's just for starters, with Cindy Lou Johnson's 1992 dramedy
vaulting two decades, taking in another marriage and mugging and a
memorial by the final curtain. Charles Waxberg stages this attempt at
modern Chekhov with a measure of technical resourcefulness and
excessive acting-class maneuvers, permitting his likable cast lavish
internal moments at the expense of pace.</TE>
<TE>   The snappy DeBevoise and the understated Braendlin most
successfully override this. Correa and Salamone fare best with
emotional peaks and comic zingers, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Guindy makes roughly half of his twists ring true, more than
James' stilted adulterer manages, while Craig Christman's arbitrarily
written drunk is most notable for his front-row entrance.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's script merges genuinely quirky humor with overly exposed
construction, displaying subtext and foreshadowing like epaulets.
This, along with sanitized dialogue scarcely representative of young
moderns anywhere, ultimately resembles a relatively literate pilot
for Oxygen TV.</TE>

<TE>   Deception Cloaked in Tradition in 'Gumsimao'</TE>
<TE>   Ancient Chinese culture and contemporary freedoms collide in a big
way in "Gumsimao," a new play by Jean Colonomos that examines one of
the stranger child-rearing mutations lurking beneath the veneer of
assimilation in our melting-pot society.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by a true story recounted to Colonomos in a chance
conversation, this quirky drama, set in New York City during the
1970s, revolves in kaleidoscopic fashion around Kenny (Alma Cielo),
the daughter of tradition-obsessed parents who raise her as a son.
It's a decision that has profound consequences for Kenny's
self-concept as she goes from childhood through high school
concealing her true gender. Think "Boys Don't Cry" with chopsticks.</TE>
<TE>   The primary challenge here is establishing a credible reason for
this bizarre circumstance, successfully achieved through Michael
Yama's potent portrayal of Kenny's relentlessly autocratic father,
Weiman. In a splintered series of confessions, Weiman reveals his
guilt over being the only survivor of a doomed family who sacrificed
everything to smuggle him out of China, and the ancient pressure he
feels to continue their line at all costs.</TE>
<TE>   Weiman's arranged marriage to the equally traditional Maeling
(Cici Lau), a paragon of domestic docility, sets the stage for their
desperate stratagem when they fail to produce a male child. They even
go as far as arranging Kenny's marriage to an already-pregnant
girl--a move that will preserve the good name of both families, but
at the terrible price of imprisoning the two youths in a relationship
built on a lie.</TE>
<TE>   It's the last straw for Kenny, already in turmoil over keeping her
secret from the boy she's attracted to, her lifelong friend Colin
(Ogie Zulueta). The pretext of a heart murmur spares Kenny the
anatomical revelations of gym class, but the sensitive yearnings she
can't conceal lead Colin to conclude his buddy is gay. Horribly
conflicted between her sense of family loyalty and her feelings for
Colin, Kenny assumes the nickname "Lyman" as the overly symbolic
expression of a persona built on deception.</TE>
<TE>   In telling Kenny's story, Colonomos employs a fractured chronology
that her program notes trace to the influence of choreographer Merce
Cunningham. But narrative isn't dance, and this trendy, overworked
technique, which skirts character interplay by relying on revelatory
monologues, proves double-edged.</TE>
<TE>   On the plus side, the juxtaposition of scenes from various points
in Kenny's life ingeniously mirrors her fragmented identity. Although
the events are not terribly difficult to follow--the sequence of
episodes follows a coherent thematic, if not temporal, flow--the
intellectual challenge of this puzzle-box presentation impedes
emotional involvement with Kenny and her predicament.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer J. Yun's visually stylish staging makes good use of the
expansive Playwrights' Arena venue (still following a self-imposed
99-seat limit), incorporating traditional Chinese elements, such as
tapestries, red silk costumes and even a narrator (Cathleen Chin) who
mimes I Ching coin tosses while reciting cryptic fortune-cookie
aphorisms. The play achieves broader resonance, however, with its
heartbreaking depiction of the way parents can make their innocent
children pay the price for their own unfulfilled needs.</TE>
<TE>   P.B.</TE>
<TE>   "Gumsimao," Playwrights' Arena at the Los Angeles Theatre Center,
514 S. Spring St., Los Angeles. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3
p.m. Ends July 21. $15-$20. (213) 473-0640 or (213) 485-1631. Running
time: 1 hour, 15 minutes.</TE>

<TE>   Brotherly Behavior That Spans the Centuries</TE>
<TE>   Two brothers, as different as night and day. One is open-minded
and generous, the other judgmental and tightfisted. Each is trying to
pass his values on to a son--an effort that is about to yield comic
surprises.</TE>
<TE>   Though written in 160 BC, "The Brothers," by the Roman playwright
Terence, remains a keen study of human behavior, carried along on a
wave of farcical humor. It can still lay 'em in the aisles, as is
demonstrated in a free outdoor presentation by the Action/Reaction
Theater Company in Glendale's Brand Park.</TE>
<TE>   The performance is given on the lawn in front of the Doctor's
House, a Victorian structure with twin latticework-trimmed porches
that frame separate entries. As incongruous as this might seem, it
actually serves as a credible approximation of the multi-door facades
that the Romans used.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, the playful mishmash of styles is what makes this
production so much fun. While Don Nelson's colorful, toga-like
costumes evoke ancient times, the witty new translation by
Christopher Pearson speaks in a present-day vernacular of such
phrases as "I'm out of here," "Get a grip" and "I'm dead meat."</TE>
<TE>   The action occasionally stalls, but most of the time, it zips
along--under Michael Holmes' direction--in a frenzy of eye-bulging,
hair-pulling angst and reeling, party-hearty merriment.</TE>
<TE>   Micio (Walter Beery) is a liberal-minded urban bachelor who,
because he is wealthier, is raising one son for his conservative
rural brother, Demea (Joseph M. Hoffman), while Demea raises the
other son on his own. The boys reflect their upbringings: Aeschinus
(Michael Beck) looks, talks and acts like a carefree surfer dude,
while Ctesipho (Jason Lynn Thomas) is a clean-cut bundle of nerves.
The crafty slave Syrus (Kelly Franett) helps guide both sets of
brothers toward a better understanding of themselves, while Geta
(Thomas Sullivan), attached to the household next to Micio's, pumps
up the comedy by vacillating, when upset, between histrionic wreck
and "WWE Smackdown!"-type tough guy.</TE>
<TE>   In both generations, it is the brother accused of loose morals who
turns out to be more truly moral--a twist still in use in any number
of sitcoms.</TE>

<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the interest of accuracy, Yvan Attal's fizzy romantic comedy "My
Wife Is an Actress" would be better titled "My Wife Is a Movie Star."
There are thousands of struggling actresses who would happily take on
the problems of the screen diva Charlotte, played by Attal's
real-life wife, Charlotte Gainsbourg, who is badgered in restaurants
to sign autographs, repeatedly asked the same vapid interview
questions and required to do love scenes at 8 a.m. with actors who
haven't gargled.</LD>
<LD>   Whether or not they would want to take on the jealous husband
played by Attal is anyone's guess. Attal's character, also
self-referentially named Yvan, doesn't give much thought to the
intimate demands of his wife's occupation until some schmo
acquaintance of his sister starts grilling him about his feelings.
Suddenly Yvan is a man obsessed. And he can throw himself into
obsession whole hog, since his job as a sportswriter seems to leave
him nothing but time to travel between Paris and his wife's film set
in London, or take acting classes so as to better understand the life
of an artiste.</LD>
<TE>   The French are very good at taking sit-commy setups and cloaking
the machinery with charming and surprisingly resonant comic nuance.
(Remember "Three Men and a Cradle" before it was amplified into a
strident stateside remake?) In this one, Yvan's insecurities are
contrasted with the determination of his nominally Jewish and very
pregnant sister, Nathalie (the appealing Noemie Lvovsky), to have her
baby son circumcised.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking as someone who counted four graffiti swastikas on his
recent swing through Provence, I found Nathalie's martyred arguments
with her husband (when all else fails, bring up the Holocaust) a
welcome satirical blast of real life.</TE>
<TE>   Terence Stamp adds to the self-mocking esprit de corps as
Charlotte's seductive British co-star, a dilettante dabbler in oil
paint who gives Yvan good cause to be jealous. Stamp is the
good-natured butt of two of Yvan's more wicked pranks, which send up
the Parisian ardor for good brie and exacting enunciation.</TE>
<TE>   What gives "My Wife Is An Actress" its extra juice is the natural
energy exchange between the spirited real-life couple, who conjure
the sort of credibly warm interplay that is hard to fake and probably
harder to reproduce in front of a camera. It's nice, for a change, to
see a romantic comedy in which the falling-in-love part has been
dispatched by the opening credits. It leaves more time for the
falling-on-your-face parts, which are far more delicious.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R for language and nudity/sexuality. Times
guidelines: Adult situations.</TE>

<HD>Up the Underworld Ladder</HD>
<DH>A thug, forcefully played by Paul Bettany in youth and
Malcolm McDowell in middle age, aspires to be 'Gangster No. 1.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taut, corrosive and compelling, "Gangster No. 1" has the galvanic
appeal of "Little Caesar" and "Scarface" in its full-sized portrait
of a brilliant but twisted and savage criminal. Never identified by
name, he is played in his youth by Paul Bettany and in middle age by
Malcolm McDowell. The two actors blend in depicting a man with no
limits in slaking his lust for power and without equal in the London
underworld in his use of cunning to achieve his ends.</LD>
<LD>   In adapting Louis Mellis and David Scinto's play, writer Johnny
Ferguson doesn't betray his script's theatrical origins, and director
Paul McGuigan, in a remarkably forceful and confident feature debut,
never loses control of his operatic material or his powerhouse
actors. Gangster No. 1 is a sadistic, homicidal maniac, but as crazed
as Bettany and McDowell show him to be, his madness isn't allowed to
overwhelm the scale of what is at heart an intimate drama.</LD>
<TE>   The film opens in 1999 in a posh London ballroom where people dine
in formal dress as a boxing match takes place in a ring in the center
of the room, with the match emerging as a metaphor for the brutal
world we're about to enter. Gangster No. 1 (McDowell) is at the head
of a large table of similarly middle-aged men. He's at the pinnacle
of his power, and his men, waxing mellow, reminisce about the old
days and old cohorts. "Speaking of oldies but goodies," says one thug
expansively, "Freddie Mays is getting out next month."</TE>
<TE>   For perhaps the first time in his life, Gangster No. 1 is struck
with fear and commences to tell us his story. We flash back to
swinging London, 1968, and Gangster No. 1 is a thin, reddish-blond
kid (Bettany) with an unsettling blue-eyed gaze. He has sufficiently
impressed one of Freddie Mays' henchmen to win an audience with Mays,
the Butcher of Mayfair. Ensconced in a smashing Vegas-like,
black-and-gold high-rise apartment and sharing the late John Gotti's
sartorial tastes, Freddie is a smart young man who's risen to the top
fast. He is everything that Gangster No. 1 wants to be. Mays is
impressed with Gangster No. 1 and makes him his right-hand man.</TE>
<TE>   For a brief, shining moment in Gangster No. 1's life, he and
Freddie are a peerless criminal duo--until nightclub singer Karen
(Saffron Burrows) walks in and steals Freddie's heart, just when he
needs to concentrate on a gangland rivalry. Gangster No. 1, who is
openly contemptuous of women and who may well be in love with Freddie
himself but would never, never admit it to himself, diabolically
seizes the moment, fueled by jealous rage. When it comes to
ruthlessness, Freddie is a Sunday-school kid in comparison to
Gangster No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Now three decades later, Gangster No. 1 thinks he must confront
Freddie again, not realizing it might involve confronting himself. It
takes actors of the caliber of McDowell and David Thewlis as Freddie
to pull off a quite daring and unpredictable encounter; McDowell
scales the heights in his best demented form while Thewlis keeps him
anchored.</TE>
<TE>   If the McDowell of "A Clockwork Orange" hovers over the film, so
does the spirit of Greek tragedy. The filmmakers, aware they're
dealing with archetypes, accordingly subsume them in sterling,
fleshed-out portrayals and a superbly evoked sense of time and place,
of the present and the '60s.</TE>
<TE>   Cinematographer Peter Sova's riveting images; Richard Bridgland's
flawless, wide-ranging production design; Jany Temine's costumes;
Jenny Shircore's hair and makeup designs; and John Dankworth's
mood-setting score, interspersed with vintage pop tunes chosen for
ironic effect, blend to perfection. Nothing is heavy-handed, and for
all the volatility of this timeless crime saga and the inevitable
violence, McGuigan allows much of the savagery to play out in our
imagination. "Gangster No. 1" is solid, satisfying fare for adults.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong, brutal violence, pervasive language,
brief drug use, and nudity. Times guidelines: unsuitable for
children.</TE>

<LD>A baby wipe, an empty holster and an insurance statement from a Dr.
Kroger. Given these items, can you assemble a profile of their owner?</LD>
<LD>   If you said, "Why, it's a brilliant San Francisco police detective
who's trying to rejoin the force after a suspension because of
obsessive compulsiveness spurred by a tragic loss in his life," then
you might as well call yourself Adrian Monk.</LD>
<LD>   This champion of the broad jump to Olympic-sized conclusions is
the hero of the not-so-mysteriously titled "Monk," a detective series
premiering tonight at 9 on USA with a two-hour installment, before
moving into a 10-11 p.m. slot next week.</LD>
<TE>   Apprehension, in every sense of the word, is the name of his game.
Possessed of a photographic memory and the reasoning ability of nine
Supreme Court justices, Monk (Tony Shalhoub) knows how to put
criminals behind bars. What he can't arrest are the neuroses, enough
to fill up half the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, derailing his career.</TE>
<TE>   Sounds like heavy stuff. But not in this show, which turns the
demon of anxiety into a muse of comedy. While participating in
investigations as a consultant, Monk is distracted by fears of germs
when shaking hands and by whether he left his oven on at home. The
only person with the knack for soothing him is his nurse Sharona
(Bitty Schram), who dispenses common sense and disinfecting tissues.</TE>
<TE>   Despite very likable characters, deft acting and the psychological
twist, the rest of "Monk" appears to be pretty standard issue.
Tonight's mystery isn't all that hard to solve, and naturally, as
Monk pieces everything together, he drives everyone crazy. His
behavior torments his on-again, off-again boss, Capt. Stottlemeyer
(Ted Levine), most of all.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't police work, this is vaudeville!" the esteemed but so
darned conventional Stottlemeyer blurts out, and you have to agree
with him. But this is TV, after all, where even a germ-phobic hero
can feel compelled to touch and count every parking meter he passes
while fleeing from a driver trying to run him over.</TE>

<HD>Hanks' Road Less Traveled</HD>
<DH>As 'Road to Perdition's' skilled assassin, he does a career
about-face, resulting in one of his best performances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Half a century ago, James Stewart, at that point the most beloved of
American leading men, decided it was time for something completely
different.</LD>
<LD>   In a series of bitter, disturbing, early-1950s westerns directed
by Anthony Mann--"Winchester '73," "The Naked Spur" and "The Man From
Laramie"--Stewart began playing ruthless loners bent on revenge, men
capable of rages so terrifying that to experience them is to forget
that the sentimental Stewart of "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" and
"It's a Wonderful Life" ever existed.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart's chilling about-face inevitably comes to mind when
watching his modern equivalent, Tom Hanks, identically turn himself
inside-out (or is it outside-in?) in director Sam Mendes' brooding,
powerful, exquisitely made "Road to Perdition," playing a
Depression-era gangland executioner so skilled and implacable he's
known as the Angel of Death.</LD>
<TE>   Hanks' Michael Sullivan is a man of few words and less inflection,
capable of freezing his rivals with hard looks from impenetrable eyes
as well as disconcerting his two young sons with the weight and
solemnity of his presence.</TE>
<TE>   It is a lean and deadly performance, one of Hanks' best, and
because it is free of mannerisms and has the feeling of coming from
an unexpectedly dark and deep place, it makes Sullivan's savage
pursuit of a bloody revenge particularly scary and convincing.</TE>
<TE>   It is also unnerving because Hanks remains Hanks, a person we
instinctively connect with no matter how bloody his trade.</TE>
<TE>   And so, although his milieu is a violent one, Sullivan's story is
finally an emotional and personal one.</TE>
<TE>   It's the story of the unavoidably difficult relationship between
fathers and sons, both biological and surrogate, a touchy connection
a character sums up by insisting, "It's a natural law: Sons are put
on this earth to trouble their fathers."</TE>
<TE>   Mendes, in only his second feature (following the Oscar-winning
"American Beauty"), has told this surprisingly resonant story with
the potent, unrelenting fatalism of a previously unknown Greek myth.</TE>
<TE>   This is classic albeit somber filmmaking, restrained and all of a
piece, by a director who believes film can tell adult stories in an
adult manner, who knows the effects he wants and how to get them.</TE>
<TE>   "Road to Perdition" started life as a 1998 graphic novel by Max
Allan Collins with art by Richard Piers Rayner.</TE>
<TE>   David Self, who previously wrote the focused "Thirteen Days" and
the out-of-control "The Haunting," has made some very shrewd changes
to the original that increase its emotional wattage. Sullivan has a
closer relationship with the crime boss he now considers his
surrogate father as well as a more unresolved, unsettled one with his
12-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   "Road to Perdition" opens with a spare voice-over, spoken by that
son as a grown man, that establishes an unwavering tone and sets up
the plot: "There are many stories about Michael Sullivan. Some say he
was a decent man. Some say there was no good in him at all. But I
once spent six weeks with him in the winter of 1931. This is our
story."</TE>
<TE>   As is fitting for a violent story, "Perdition" opens with a wake
in one of the biggest houses in Rock Island, Ill. It belongs to John
Rooney (a faultless Paul Newman), who, at first glance, comes off as
a garrulous community leader or maybe the indulgent grandfather to
Sullivan's two boys, the older Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) and the
younger Peter (Liam Aiken).</TE>
<TE>   But in truth, Rooney is a major underworld kingpin, a close
associate of Al Capone, someone of whom it is truthfully, and
fearfully, said, "You rule this town as God rules the Earth. You give
and you take away."</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan is more than the top lieutenant who enforces the boss'
edicts in blood; he has been like a son to Rooney ever since he was a
young orphan taken under the powerful man's wing.</TE>
<TE>   This closeness is beautifully and wordlessly conveyed in a scene
at the wake when the two men casually collaborate on a quiet piano
duet. It's a lovely thing to everyone but Rooney's natural son Connor
(British actor Daniel Craig, a long way from "Lara Croft: Tomb
Raider"), the classic Sonny Cor- leone-type hothead whose appetite
for blood is more apparent than his sanity.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan's two boys idolize him, although they're not really sure
what he does. They hope he's a secret agent, someone who goes on
missions like their hero, the Lone Ranger.</TE>
<TE>   One night, Michael Jr. tags along hidden in a car and, in a vision
of almost primal intensity, sees his father take part in a savage
bloodbath. It's a moment that not only changes their relationship,
but that also leads inexorably to the cold-blooded murder of the
boy's younger brother and his mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh).</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan is a man built for revenge, but he hadn't counted on
having his son with him as he sets out on what is, of course, a
drenched-in-violence journey to get it. Sullivan needs to find a way
to smoke out his family's killer, to stay one step ahead of Maguire
(Jude Law), the eccentric assassin sent after him and to improve a
relationship with his surviving son--whom he'd like to deposit with
relatives in a town called Perdition--that is freighted with all
kinds of complications neither feels equipped to handle.</TE>
<TE>   "Road to Perdition's" excellent cast sees to it that all the
ramifications of this story play out as they're supposed to. Newman,
who gets nothing but better with age, is riveting as a cold-blooded
man of business weighing his legacy against his feelings for a
surrogate son. Law brings the right amount of strangeness to a killer
whose main drive is to photograph his victims and Stanley Tucci has
an effective cameo as Capone cohort Frank Nitti. And Hoechlin, one of
more than 2,000 who tried out for the part of young Sullivan,
effectively creates a character who gets under his father's skin.</TE>
<TE>   For people who make studio films, opportunities to work on serious
projects with sizable budgets are rare, and "Road to Perdition" has
obtained the services of what is, in effect, an all-star team of
behind-the-camera personnel, starting with graceful cinematographer
Conrad L. Hall.</TE>
<TE>   A two-time Oscar winner (including one for "American Beauty") and
a nine-time nominee, Hall has crafted, without seeming to try too
hard, a series of beautifully bleak, unforgiving Midwest-in-winter
vistas that use the dark colors of nightmare to recall the loneliness
of Edward Hopper canvases.</TE>
<TE>   Re-creating the meticulous sense of 1930s atmosphere that Richard
Piers Rayner brought to the graphic novel are production designer
Dennis Gassner and costume designer Albert Wolsky, a two-time Oscar
winner, for "All That Jazz" and "Bugsy."</TE>
<TE>   The evocative score is by Thomas Newman and giving the film its
stately pace is editor Jill Bilcock, who last did Baz Luhrmann's very
different "Moulin Rouge."</TE>
<TE>   "Road to Perdition" has worried a great deal about the details, to
the point of having fabric specially woven, aged and dyed so costumes
had the proper weight for the period, but that doesn't mean emotion
has been neglected. Because it is so careful with its effects, this
film's ability to create feeling sneaks up and surprises.</TE>
<TE>   This is a story with a will to move us and the ability to do
whatever it takes to make that happen.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for violence and language. Times guidelines: The
violence, both real and suggested, is truly frightening, especially
when it's directed at children.</TE>

<DH>U.S. designer Ralph Rucci alters runway history while
making a hit</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>PARIS--As the first American designer to show an haute couture
collection here since before World War II, New York designer Ralph
Rucci was greeted with quite a commotion minutes before his debut
Thursday. But little did Rucci, 45, the son of a South Philadelphia
butcher, know that the noise came from bank strikers who work inside
the Hotel d'Evreux where his collection was presented.</LD>
<LD>   The strikers--yelling, stomping and creating quite a ruckus on a
floor above Rucci's runway room--stopped a few minutes before the
designer showed 54 outfits of his fall/winter 2002-03 couture
collection. Leave it to the French to be respectful of fashion
history--even though most are too young to recall Chicago-born Main
Rousseau Bocher, known as Mainbocher, who took couture by storm in
1929 with what he called "the modern full dress."</LD>
<LD>   Rucci's looks ranged from his signature double-faced cashmere ski
sweaters to a stunning laser-cut knitted sable kimono and a blood-red
matte jersey fluted gown and stole.</LD>
<TE>   The intimate group of fewer than 100 guests, including close
friends, buyers, the press and mostly women 50 and older, seemed to
recognize and appreciate Rucci's technical expertise and restraint in
design. They applauded his refined creations that paid attention to
subtle detail and minimal glitz. Crowd pleasers were a bronze
duchesse satin gown, a black-silk velvet and moire gown and matching
stole, and dark green Russian broadtail pants teamed with a cashmere
tunic and cape worn by top models that sported somber makeup and
chignons.</TE>
<TE>   Rucci's bow at the show's finale in a room bathed with sunlight
was met with "bravos" from the audience, many eager to congratulate
the designer as he headed backstage followed by clamoring camera
crews.</TE>
<TE>   Later, in a private interview, Rucci, a deeply religious man, was
the picture of calm sophistication as models packed up and workers
tore down the set. "Calm because this is always the way I feel after
a show," he said, and then admitted that being in a city that is
"passionate about fashion" has been "almost a religious experience. I
could just cry in front of you. I am so honored, proud and humble
because it's been a dream" to be here.</TE>
<TE>   A designer for 22 years, Rucci has worked in relative
obscurity--even in the United States. His clothes haven't been
featured widely in magazines but they command prices in the thousands
of dollars--this spring's sweater set, hand-beaded by Lesage, goes
for $76,000--at exclusive specialty stores such as Neiman Marcus and
Saks Fifth Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   "I was prepared," Rucci said about the show, adding he felt "so
confident and peaceful. That's how I feel before every collection
because before anyone can see it, before anyone can judge, I am the
judge. So, I don't show it unless I know it's correct. Then I
meditate a great deal."</TE>
<TE>   Rucci, who earned degrees in philosophy and literature in the late
1970s while practicing the fine arts of acrylics, screen printing,
watercolor and collage at Philadelphia's Temple University, moved to
New York in 1978, where he studied at the Fashion Institute of
Technology and began his formal career in the made-to-order Halston
workrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, using his one-room apartment as his design
studio, he set out to establish himself as a couturier, influenced by
the design, technique and discipline of his fashion heroes Cristobal
Balenciaga, Madame Gres and Charles James. In 1994, he launched his
ready-to-wear collection, Chado, named after a centuries-old Japanese
tea ceremony consisting of 331 distinct steps that, when performed,
create an overall sense of grace and elegance--principles Rucci
brings to his designs and that were clearly evident Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Technically, I think we surpassed ourselves," he said of the
couture collection. Of his staff, he added "emotionally, we have all
invested a tremendous amount of ourselves collectively."</TE>
<TE>   Rucci said his motivation to show here was also about business.
"I've been making haute couture but I've just not been showing it in
Paris. By bringing it here we are going to increase our business, and
growing our haute couture business will help us support our
ready-to-wear business."</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, fashion is not just about money. "A Chanel jacket,
for instance, is a piece of art. Turn it inside out and frame it."</TE>
<TE>   When he showed his first collection, he said he only had enough
money to create 13 outfits--a collection that was an homage to Madame
Gres and Balenciaga. But on Thursday, he said he felt "like I have
achieved something" and was exactly where he had to be. But he knows,
too well, that he has "a lot more to do." And that's perfectly fine
because "I do this for me and only for me."</TE>
<TE>   And because, he says, "We must keep the rigor, the discipline of
haute couture alive because, to me, it's very emotional and it's very
specific. It cannot and will never die. It's against things that are
mediocre.</TE>

<LD>It was a fairy tale, Malibu style: The sun sank into the ocean while
men in tights wooed glittery nymphs on a makeshift stage at one end
of the tennis court. About 100 guests, supporters of the American
Ballet Theatre, gathered at the $30-million palazzo of Howard and
Nancy Marks, once owned by late Herbalife founder Mark Hughes. The
lush setting included a rose garden, a swimming pool overlooking the
ocean, and a handsome catering staff on walkie-talkies. Guests
mingled among cascades of white and pink roses and glowing paper
lanterns.</LD>
<LD>   Cindy Crawford and husband Rande Gerber sneaked in between two pas
de deux, distracting a row of women, who whispered to each other.
Later, a slightly defensive Crawford told a guest: "We didn't miss
it--we watched from the sidelines." The supermodel was being watched,
too. "Boots?" one woman exclaimed cattily. "She's Cindy Crawford. She
can get away with boots," replied her friend. (Crawford and the
dancers wore Escada, courtesy of the fashion house. One publicist
revealed they all fit a size 6, prompting a couple of women to marvel
at the true meaning of 6.)</LD>
<LD>   After the performance, former junk-bond king Michael Milken
chatted with the host, Howard Marks. So, what had precipitated their
involvement with the ballet? Their wives, they said, almost in
unison. And, added Milken, his daughter wanted to become a ballerina.</LD>
<TE>   At dinner, a couple of dancers ate, while at one table, talk
turned to corporate scandals. Georgina Parkinson, a former ballerina
with the Royal Ballet of London, now a ballet mistress for the ABT,
described having witnessed some of fallen Tyco chief executive Dennis
Kozlowski's lavish lifestyle--the yacht, the oceanfront Nantucket
property, the 5th Avenue apartment, the art collection. "You knew
something was wrong," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As the evening drew to a close, Susan Jaffe, recently retired ABT
dancer, waited for her driver. She'd returned her borrowed dress and
had changed into a simple top and skirt. "I've turned into a pumpkin
again," she said, and headed into the night.</TE>
<TE>   Hanks on the 'Road'</TE>
<TE>   Tom Hanks was at his merry best Wednesday night. He was the first
to arrive at the Academy of Motion Picture and Sciences theater in
Beverly Hills for the local premiere of his new film "The Road to
Perdition." It was the third opening for the picture in two weeks and
Hanks and co-star Tyler Hoechlin were the only stars from the movie
to attend. In the film, Hanks stars as a hitman for the Irish mob in
the early 1930s and Hoechlin plays his son.</TE>
<TE>   Director-producer Sam Mendes; Paul Newman, who stars as the Irish
mob boss and adopted father to Hanks' character; Jude Law, who
portrays a press photographer-turned-mob hitman; and Stanley Tucci,
who plays an Italian American mob boss, had other commitments.</TE>
<TE>   But Hanks, who turned 46 on Tuesday, carried the evening with no
signs of press weariness. He volleyed questions with humor as Candice
Bergen and William H. Macy made their way into the theater behind
him. When a KCBS reporter quizzed him about the Oscar buzz
surrounding Hanks' performance in the film, he joked, "It's only
July," looking at his watch. "We've got to see how many people are
going to fork over ... the nine bucks to see the movie." As he walked
past a reporter for the TV Guide Channel, Hanks quipped, "Why does TV
Guide need a channel? Is the TV Guide Channel listed in the TV Guide?
The media is beginning to feed on itself."</TE>

<HD>First Lady May Be Shopping for a Different Look, New
Designer</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Though First Lady Laura Bush has been known for her
plain-to-the-point-of-dull style of dressing, she may be turning over
a new leaf. Escorted by a fleet of police and Secret Service agents,
she arrived Thursday at the 501 7th Ave. offices of New York designer
Carolina Herrera.</LD>
<LD>   If Herrera becomes the first lady's designer of choice, expect to
see Bush in shimmery satin, flamenco ruffles and luxurious cashmere.
The high-fashion designer's understated style would be a welcome
departure from the stodgy looks that Bush has chosen previously from
Arnold Scaasi, her mother-in-law's designer. Herrera is one of New
York's most reliably elegant designers, and she's the best known and
most au courant to be chosen by Bush. The first lady selected
little-known Dallas couturier Michael Faircloth to design her
inaugural wardrobe, but soon moved on.</LD>
<LD>   Bush has gradually improved her style profile since moving to
Washington. Many remember a dreadful plaid skirt suit she once wore.
Perhaps Herrera will erase the memory.</LD>

<LD>Although the Fourth of July fireworks have faded away, you can still
experience the excitement of early America at Colonial National
Historical Park in Jamestown and Yorktown, Va. Jamestown was the site
of the first permanent English settlement in North America. Yorktown
was the site of the final major battle of the American Revolutionary
War. Together they represent the beginning and end of colonial
America.</LD>
<LD>   At Colonial National Historical Park you can go back in time with
a costumed tour guide, watch artisans shape glass just as people did
in the 1600s, hear the blast of the largest siege cannon used by the
Americans at Yorktown, or maybe participate in a military drill.</LD>
<LD>   You can watch archeologists dig in Jamestown, then look through
the gallery where new artifacts are taken and washed, cataloged and
studied. You can learn all about pottery-making in Yorktown while you
make your own clay pot. Don't miss the exhibit in the visitor center
that tells the story of the battle at Yorktown through the eyes of a
14-year-old boy serving in the colonial army. And this summer you can
walk inside one of George Washington's tents and see how it might
have been set up during the American Revolution.</LD>

<LD>Sandra Cisneros is America's most widely read Latina author, so the
publication in September of her long-awaited second novel,
"Caramelo," is a much anticipated event.</LD>
<LD>   It also will be another moment of satisfying affirmation for Susan
Bergholz, the New York-based literary agent who has championed
Cisneros' work and that of many other Latino and Asian-American
writers.</LD>
<LD>   "There's so much great writing coming out of the Latino community,
and now there's some glitter to match," said Bergholz, reflecting on
the sales and advances generated by authors whose work was once
virtually ignored by major publishers.</LD>
<TE>   Cisneros' first novel, "The House on Mango Street," has sold 2
million copies. In 1982, recalls Bergholz, "when we started with
Sandra, there were just two takers willing to bid for her book. Then
she sold 100,000 copies and there was a flood of interest. She
knocked down doors for this second generation of non-Anglo writers."</TE>
<TE>   Some of those doors, Bergholz argues, were opened by unheralded
allies--teachers, textbook editors and librarians. "Sandra was first
widely published in textbooks because editors responded to teachers'
complaints that there weren't stories to which their Latino students
could relate. Librarians said the same thing. I think it is to their
great credit that they recognized this need in their young readers
and then filled it. For me, it has been a great lesson."</TE>
<TE>   The early enthusiasm of teachers and librarians for Cisneros' work
contrasted sharply with the confusion it evoked in other traditional
literary quarters. In which critical pigeonhole did the coming-of-age
story belong? Was it prose, poetry or memoir? Was its audience adult
or adolescent? What was to be made of its feminism, its preoccupation
with love and oppression? What helped bring Cisneros' work into
critical focus was the realization that some of its important
antecedents were to be found in Testimonio, the Mexican literary
genre that incorporates all these elements.</TE>
<TE>   Bergholz believes another, similarly important process of cultural
recognition currently is underway, accomplished--as she describes
it--by "interesting writers from not-entirely-Anglo backgrounds. For
example, there is Hawaiian novelist Lois-Anne Yamanaka,  who writes
in pidgin and English. Can you imagine that she now is being
published by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux?</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell you that when I first brought Sandra Cisneros' [short
fiction collection] 'Woman Hollering Creek' to publishers in 1989,
they said, 'We can't do this. You'd need a dictionary to read it."
Now, she says, New Mexican novelist Rudy Anaya doesn't even italicize
the Spanish in his work. "I have a Korean American client, Nora Okja
Keller, who wrote 'Fox Girl.' She uses Korean phrases in her prose,
when they're significant and appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the fact that these diverse new sounds that already are
heard in the spoken English on our streets are now to be found in our
literature too. The mainstream just isn't the mainstream anymore--and
it hasn't been for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Looking Over Other Readers' Shoulders</TE>
<TE>   Reading is a solitary pleasure, but not an introverted one.</TE>
<TE>   The proliferation of book clubs and "one-book-one-city" reading
programs is testament to that. So, too, is the continuing fascination
with information about who is reading what and in what numbers.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, Barnes &amp; Noble.com/Barnes &amp; Noble, the world's
largest bookseller, has taken the unusual step of making current
sales information available on the Web at www.barnesand
noble.com/bestsellers. The site lists the chain's bestselling volumes
in 300 categories, tallies orders placed for books yet to appear in
the stores and breaks down the most popular titles by topics--say,
presidential biographies--and even by cities. These are updated
weekly, but a list of Barnes &amp; Noble's 100 bestselling books is
updated hourly.</TE>
<TE>   It is a unique snapshot of readers' tastes at any given moment,
but why share it?</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that people are hungry for recommendations," said
Barnes &amp; Noble.com chief executive Marie Toulantis, "and what this
does is let readers make recommendations to other readers. Obviously,
there are a lot of lists published in newspapers around the country,
but because of our size we have a unique ability to take the pulse of
what people are reading. Not only do we have 600 stores, but Barnes &amp;
Noble.com attracts 10 million unique visitors each year. We did more
than $400 million in online business last year and 6% to 8% of our
sales are overseas."</TE>
<TE>   Toulantis pointed out that the new site also gives readers a
window on the forces that move book markets. Television, particularly
the networks' morning shows, powerfully influence book buyers. "They
seem to meet people's need for a personal recommendation," she said.
"We see an immediate pop in the sales of any book mentioned on those
shows." For example, on the day Steven L. Carter appeared on NBC's
"Today" show, the company's online sales of his novel "The Emperor of
Ocean Park" jumped 630%.</TE>
<TE>   "It goes against the notion that viewers are not readers,"
Toulantis said.</TE>
<TE>   When regional differences in taste are considered--between New
York and Los Angeles, for example--other interesting facts emerge.
"Big books by popular authors tend to do well in both places," said
Toulantis, "but New Yorkers are particularly drawn to any book with a
New York twist."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, over the past week, Barnes &amp; Noble's customers in both
cities liked not only Carter's novel, but also Long Beach author Anne
Sebold's intensely literary first novel, "The Lovely Bones," and
evangelical minister Tim LaHaye's 10th installment in his fictional
"Left Behind" series. But while New York's top 10 books are all
current fiction, George Orwell's classic "Animal Farm" and a
dictionary appear on the L.A. list.</TE>
<TE>   "In the summer, we see many classic titles doing very well, as
students come in with school summer reading lists," said Barnes &amp;
Noble.com spokeswoman Victoria Grantham. The dictionary, she
speculated, "may indicate a wave of high school graduation gifts."</TE>
<TE>   For the week of June 30 to July 6, these were the 10 bestselling
books in Barnes &amp; Noble stores across the Los Angeles and New York
metropolitan areas:</TE>

<DH>Appreciation* Midnight Special, a cultural crossroads, must
move. Regulars tell what makes the establishment special.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Margie Ghiz has always been quick to run the reality check; to work
to keep things in perspective. So the pep talk she gave her staff
just the other morning at Midnight Special Bookstore, only days after
the store announced it would be forced to move from its Third Street
Promenade location, was one she had already given herself--more than
once over the last few days.</LD>
<LD>   Moments before starting their business day, Ghiz informally
corrals the early shift staff and lays it out for them: "OK, guys, I
was looking through the paper this morning and lots of people died.
We just have to keep what's happening to us in perspective. While all
this craziness is going on everywhere else, we've got to remember
what our purpose is in the first place. That will keep us focused."</LD>
<LD>   From spontaneous mosh pit to political megaphone, Midnight Special
has been an organic bulletin board of sorts. Known as much for its
progressive politics as its far-reaching community service, Midnight
Special has long been an advocate and an anchor--a humming community
nexus when the notion of community has become increasingly difficult
to define.</LD>
<TE>   Like many an independent bookseller who has weathered shifts in
both tastes and economics, Ghiz has war stories to tell: Moves. The
chains. The mega-chains. The Internet. "But this one makes me sad,"
she says, sinking into her desk chair in her small book- and
snapshot-lined office.</TE>
<TE>   For the last 10 of its 30 years in existence, Midnight Special has
ruptured, rallied and reinvented itself in this Santa Monica
location, under the sturdy hand of Ghiz, her sister, Geri Silva, and
their informed and opinionated staff members. But this has been the
hardest blow. Just about two weeks ago, Ghiz was given notice by her
landlord, Walter N. Marks Inc., that due to rising costs the store,
which had been paying a reduced rent, must either pay the full cost
or vacate. And, now, instead of political slogans, rhetorical
questions, koans, flags or impressionistic tombstones lining the
store's huge picture window, a simple open letter informs all who
walk by of its imminent departure.</TE>
<TE>   Since word leaked out early this week, the phone has been ringing
nonstop. Ghiz's e-mail box is full of sympathy notes, advice, leads
and questions. "It's shocking but not surprising," says James Fugate,
co-owner of the independent EsoWon Books. "And in this economic
environment, you have no idea how much it worries me. I have to work
up [the nerve] to call her."</TE>
<TE>   "The funny thing," cracks Ghiz, her spirit lightening somewhat,
"many people are ... also saying, well, gee, at least you'll be
getting out of the Promenade."</TE>
<TE>   Dory Dutton, an independent publisher's representative and part of
the Southern California bookselling Dutton dynasty, has heard that
quip, but she is feeling guarded about making light just yet. "My
worry is that she will not find a place adequate for what her vision
is. I don't know how she can take a step backward," says Dutton.</TE>
<TE>   A High-Profile Stage</TE>
<TE>   That Midnight Special is facing an uncertain future points to
something gone askew--if not in the culture, within our thinking,
says Dutton. "We will spend a little bit more to shop and buy our
groceries at Gelson's or buy the best coffee. With books, people have
to start thinking the same way. She's one of the last independents
left on the Promenade and the ... playing field isn't level."</TE>
<TE>   Despite its incongruity, for better or worse, the Third Street
Promenade has offered Ghiz a high-profile stage for a multidiscipline
sort of street theater. Tourists, residents, merchants could always
be inspired or incensed by what provocative material Ghiz and her
staff might post in their windows, what world event they might decide
to deconstruct, what panel she might convene. "I could put any idea
out there. I never held back. And more important, it worked."</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, Ghiz recalls, a customer drove in from Silver
Lake. Confused, rattled, he didn't know what he was looking for,
"just wanted to talk," but knew he might find it there. "People just
kept coming in ... looking for books on Islam. On the Middle East. We
already had them. Oftentimes, you worry, 'Are we just preaching to
the choir?' But there are times, we've realized, we've reached much
further than that."</TE>
<TE>   One is probably, indeed, more apt to find the already converted
perusing the shelves--activist/actor Tim Robbins or politician Tom
Hayden and urban historian Mike Davis are counted among the regulars.
But sometimes, says Ghiz, she encounters the unexpected. "I can't
tell you how surprised I was to see Richard Riordan in here. That's
when the Robbie Conal poster [targeting Riordan]--'Tunnel
Vision'--was up. And he even came back!"</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: A good bookstore is a good bookstore, says novelist
and neighbor Dan Fante, son of L.A. chronicler John Fante. "It is the
only sizable bookstore where I can walk in and the people behind the
counter actually read books themselves.... "You can take the
temperature of what's going on in literature, of what's going on in
L.A. and beyond, by simply looking in the window."</TE>
<TE>   The store has always been a draw to writers--local and traveling.
Octavia Butler researched the fine points of sediment and coastal
formations for her "Parable of the Sower" in the stacks. When in
town, Walter Mosley browses. And as lore has it, comparing notes over
dinner in Mexico City, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Carlos Fuentes
found they had a favorite Los Angeles bookstore in common.</TE>
<TE>   Ghiz won't take credit for that. She's simply continuing a
tradition. Midnight Special's first incarnation was as a scruffy
Venice storefront with a rickety staircase on what is now Abbot
Kinney. An outgrowth of the civil rights movement teach-ins and the
Vietnam War's turmoil, the store's purpose mirrored that of hundreds
of other small, grass-roots bookstores and information centers across
the country. It boasted volunteer staffs and shelves filled with
alternative titles on every subject from religion and history to
cultural studies, folklore and literature.</TE>
<TE>   Ghiz and Silva gravitated in, looking for hard-to-find works by
prominent authors--Langston Hughes and Uruguayan journalist Eduardo
Galleano. And somehow, 25 years later, they are still there,
lingering in the aisles, discovering. By the early '80s, the store
moved to Santa Monica's Third Street--then a sleepy outdoor
mall--carrying with it its political engagement and energy.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years later, "Wally was the one who convinced me to make the
move up the block," says Ghiz, who says she couldn't have done it
without his vision and support. This space, with its vast and elegant
glass, steel and cement floor, just a block and a half north of the
old location, gave Ghiz the room to not only house a wide-ranging
front and backlist but a cultural center, where readings, book
groups, panel discussions, video screenings, writers' workshops and
poetry slams took place nightly. "I can't imagine being without this
center. It's given us an amazing amount of exposure."</TE>
<TE>   Fostering diversity of thought and independence, says Kerry
Slattery, general manager of Los Feliz's independent Skylight Books,
has been one of Midnight Special's most important features: "[Ghiz
is] willing to speak up. Sometimes it rubs people the wrong way. She
takes the risk that she could lose customers, but the discussion is
for people to think about things. To take risks. And it's been really
important in an area where there is a big corporate voice."</TE>
<TE>   Political Forum</TE>
<TE>   None of this is lost on Santa Monica Mayor Michael Feinstein, who
has been a store regular since it was located a half-block south. He
often found himself pulling up a folding chair for a political forum
and panel discussion. "Here, street life isn't just tugged by Madison
Avenue's manipulation--cajoling us to buy, buy, buy, treating us only
as consumer. This challenged our mind and together with our vibrant
street performer presence, challenged us culturally. Knowing that
it's there has given me pride in my community. That it is as much of
an asset to us as the beach or the view of the mountains. It's
fertile soil for the mind."</TE>
<TE>   Much of this is particularly sad for those who thought the store
had surmounted the impossible: being sandwiched between two
super-mega chains. "They've been really successful in kind of
maintaining their autonomy against the superstore explosion," says
Mari Florence, publisher and president of L.A.-based Really Great
Books. "They have a clearly defined audience, despite it being in the
middle of a mall. You could have gotten the most recent Oprah Book
Club selection and at the same time have the book that the lefty
heard about on KPFK. And they'll have it up front on display. They've
been able to navigate both worlds and not just exist but thrive."</TE>
<TE>   Conal, whose sly political images have long been part of Midnight
Special's revolving agitprop windows, isn't ready to write the eulogy
yet: "We've all perpetrated a lot of mischief together. That place is
funky soul food for us."</TE>
<TE>   As a Westsider, says Conal, "It's kind of the center of my
cultural universe right now. The force is with Margie and that it is
something that is uncrushable. All the people she's brought through
that store, the kids who have worked for her. She brings all that
karma with her. But if it goes anywhere east of Westwood," where
there already exists a busy alternative network of cultural and
political thinkers, Conal warns, "I'm going to be sick!"</TE>
<TE>   Moved by the outpouring of support, Ghiz says she's still got a
store to run, a staff to pay, books to order and shelve, customers to
tend to. And most important--a ruckus to kick up. So until the
spring--her deadline to move--she's ready to get back to work. And
just like that, she and the staff begin winding through their
rituals. "It's like the staff says sometimes," Ghiz says. " 'Margie
runs the store. But really, it's ours.' "</TE>

<HD>Think Straw Hat or Kerchief for Bad Hair Days</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: I am a 28-year-old woman with short, pixie-like
hair. On days I don't have time to wash and style my hair, I wear a
baseball cap. Unfortunately, I look like a boy. I'd like to find a
hair-covering alternative that lets me feel confident and pretty when
I step out of the house.</LD>
<LD>   --HAIRY SITUATION</LD>
<LD>   Dear Hairy: We agree with you--baseball caps get the job done, but
they're neither feminine nor flattering. They also don't offer much
protection from the sun, since the sides and back of your neck are
left exposed.</LD>
<TE>   Your best bet for summer is the classic straw hat, which virtually
never goes out of style. There are hundreds of styles available in
natural straw and bright colors. Tighter weaves and wider brims offer
more sun protection. Casual outfits go best with hats that have few
embellishments--maybe a simple ribbon or floppy bow around the brim.
For dressier occasions look for details such as faux flowers and
multilayered bows. If you're tough on your hats there are crushable
styles that can withstand a lot of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   A big trend this summer is the bucket hat, which looks pretty much
like it sounds. The crown has a cylindrical bucket shape and the brim
is narrow and falls about eye level. It's very cute and is perfect
for hiding unwashed hair. Saks Fifth Avenue has one in sewn and
braided raffia with cute ribbon details and floral embroidery ($120,
www.saksfifthavenue.com, [877] 551-SAKS). Hats.com also offers a
Betmar cotton bucket in a few basic colors ($11, www.hats. com, [877]
566-4287). And if you're into logos, Coach has its signature "C" all
over its jacquard fabric bucket hat with a leather brim ($98,
www.coach.com, [888] 262-6224).</TE>
<TE>   We also like the vaguely retro look of simply tying a scarf around
one's head, either kerchief style, where the scarf is folded into a
triangle and tied at the back of the head, or folded into a narrow
band and tied at the top of the head. Neither offers any protection
from the elements. We asked Casey Bush of the Headwear Information
Bureau, a New York-based organization that represents men's and
women's headwear industries, to forecast some looks for fall.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that felt hats with a big, floppy brim are going to be
big," she said. Big and floppy as in those hats Jennifer Lopez has
been seen in of late. We're also starting to spot a lot of cloches,
those bell-shaped, close-fitting hats popular in the 1920s.</TE>

<LD>Soon Brian and Heather saw a light up ahead. Suddenly, they burst
into regular daylight. Again the houses were normal. Traffic went by
and people were working and playing in their frontyards.</LD>
<LD>   Most astonishing of all to Heather and Brian was the fact that
they were no longer in the little house on top of the elephant.</LD>
<LD>   "We're in the back seat of a police car," Heather exclaimed.</LD>
<TE>   "But where's Alexandra?" Brian asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Excuse me," Heather called to the policeman driving. "Can you
tell me where we're going?"</TE>
<TE>   "I'm taking you home, of course," the policeman said over his
shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "Home?" Brian exclaimed. "What happened to the elephant? What
happened to the Marvel-of-the-Age Circus? Where's Alexandra?"</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea," the policeman said. "Besides, most circuses
don't have animals anymore. All I know is when I picked you kids up,
you said you were lost. We ought to be at the address you gave me
pretty soon."</TE>
<TE>   "Do you think all that stuff with the circus really happened?"
Heather asked. "Or do you think we dreamed it somehow?"</TE>
<TE>   "I don't remember falling asleep," Brian said.</TE>
<TE>   "Me neither," Heather said. "But still...."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah. But still."</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later the police car pulled up in front of their
house.</TE>
<TE>   Alexandra was waiting for them, looking a little confused. Brian
and Heather got out of the car.</TE>
<TE>   "Where have you kids been?" Alexandra asked.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll tell you all about it," Brian said. "What about you?"</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure," Alexandra said.</TE>
<TE>   The three kids went to stand by the policeman's door. "Thanks for
taking us home," Heather said. Suddenly, her eyes got big. Next to
her, Brian's eyes were equally large.</TE>
<TE>   "Haven't we seen you somewhere before?" Alexandra asked, looking
more confused than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think so," the policeman said. He waved at them as he
drove away. The kids waved back.</TE>
<TE>   "What was that poking out of his pocket?" Alexandra asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Looked like a magic stick," Brian said. "And did you see his name
tag?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," Heather replied. "It said Officer Pimm."</TE>

<LD>Blame Coco Chanel. No matter how much research comes out about the
cancer risk of sun exposure, tans haven't fallen out of fashion since
the trend-setting French designer returned to Paris bronzed from a
cruise on the Duke of Westminster's yacht shortly after World War I.</LD>
<LD>   Bottle tans are my sunless solution each summer. Trouble is, one
errant swipe of the peanutty-smelling stuff can make you look
sun-spackled instead of sun-kissed. Three years ago, I resorted to
having a tan kneaded onto my skin at a luxe spa. But despite the posh
products and expert application, the results were still uneven and a
shade too close to Lizzie Grubman, if you know what I mean.</LD>
<LD>   This year, I am going high tech with a machine that looks like a
Porta Potti, sprays like a garden sprinkler and delivers a tan in a
process akin to an Earl Scheib quickie car paint job. The rage around
the Southland, self-tanner spray booths dispense a mist of UV-free
bronzer evenly over the entire body in less than 60 seconds.</LD>
<TE>   "The machine goes over you three or four times, front and back. It
can't miss a spot," says Raymond Klarich, 33, a hairstylist who
bought his bronze at Suntans to Go in Sherman Oaks, one of several
area tanning salons that has the new booths. "It takes two or three
hours for it to fully come into effect, but there is no streaking. It
looks so natural."</TE>
<TE>   Booths are private to allow bronzing in the buff, and the
treatments (about $25) last an average of four to five days. Shower
caps are provided to protect the head and "barrier cream" keeps
solution from falling into crevices on the hands and feet.</TE>
<TE>   Once properly prepped, I stepped inside the booth, faced the
shower in an open-legged stance and pushed the green "go" button.
It's a bit startling when the jets begin squirting the cool solution,
moving up and down, up and down. (I got so nervous, I breathed in a
cloud-full, which the salon owner insisted was harmless). After a few
seconds, the jets stopped, the cue to turn around for the reverse
treatment. The process repeated and as soon as it was started, it was
over.</TE>
<TE>   After toweling off (which is encouraged to help prevent
streaking), I was able to put my clothes back on without staining
them with color. I was sticky, like I had rolled around in a melted
snow cone, but it was a small price to pay for what turned into a
golden glow by the next morning.</TE>
<TE>   "It's perfect for people who are really fair. I'd have to lay out
every weekend all summer for eight hours a day because I'd have to
put so much sunscreen on to keep from burning," says Lindsley Lowell,
33, a publicist from L.A. "This got me dark in one treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Some users have complained about color collecting on their elbows
and knees, hands and feet. Others have had difficulty tanning their
stomachs and, um, other parts. Still, on the chat board at
Sunless.com (an entire Web site devoted to self-tanning if you can
believe it), the majority of postings about UV-free booths are
positive. "I will never go back to trying to get a real tan," wrote
Lisa Hawke, 22, a paralegal from New York City.</TE>
<TE>   Several companies make the booths but the largest is Dallas-based
Mystic Tan. With 450 units in salons in 43 states and Canada, it
bills itself a bit cheesily as the "official tan" of the Dallas
Cowboy cheerleaders. It was back in 1995 that company President Troy
Cooper and former partner Thomas Laughlin began experimenting with
prototypes inspired by a neighbor who spent a whole summer using a
pressurized paint gun to spray himself with self-tanner. By 2000,
they had perfected a design and a "unique" polarizing process called
MagneTan. "We found that a negative charge on the particles of the
bronzing mist meant the body would attract it better," Cooper
explains.</TE>
<TE>   Mystic Tan solution contains a water-soluble dye to give the
instant illusion of bronze and a chemical called DHA (dihydroxy
acetone, the product in most self-tanners), which reacts with cells
on the surface of the skin to create a deeper color. Those who have
extremely sensitive skin may want to do a patch test before using
Mystic Tan, but in general, dermatologists agree the chemical is
harmless.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no evidence that DHA is damaging," Beverly Hills
dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein says. "But Mystic Tan seems a bit
pricey. I would tell people to buy a bottle of Endless Summer by
Coppertone instead of putting themselves through a car wash."</TE>
<TE>   Not that tanning salons are having a problem attracting customers
who want to fake instead of bake. "The day before July 4, we had
people lined up all day to do it, from 11 a.m. until closing at about
9 p.m.," according to Crystal Riggleman, who works at UVA Sun Tanning
Center on 3rd Street in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Some predict sunless tanning booths could someday eclipse electric
tanning beds. "We've had a Mystic Tan booth since November and it
changed the life of the salon," says owner Greg Rand, who opened UVA
in 1982 and plans to purchase a second $30,000 sunless booth. "I
realized I had been in the wrong business. I had been in the tanning
business and I should have been in the non-tanning business."</TE>
<TE>   We are "appealing to a group we didn't appeal to before," says Rod
Perdew, who owns City Tan in Studio City. "Now we can get people in
who are albino-like, because they can get color without any harm."</TE>

self- tanning booths (www.mist- on.com) provide a similar experience.</TE>

<HD>Wholesale Prices Edge Up in June</HD>
<DH>Economy: Jobless claims rise but consumer spending remains
healthy despite stock markets' volatility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. wholesale prices edged up slightly more than expected in June,
but not enough to give the Federal Reserve reason to fret about
inflation.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, other data released Thursday showed little
improvement on the labor front but continued healthy consumer
spending--one key ingredient to the economy's recovery.</LD>
<LD>   The Labor Department said its producer price index, a closely
watched gauge of inflation at the wholesale level, climbed 0.1% last
month. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core PPI rose
0.2%, the biggest rise since December, reflecting higher wholesale
prices for autos, construction machinery and pharmaceuticals.</LD>
<TE>   Last month's bigger-than-expected gain in the PPI did not raise
concern among Wall Street economists that the central bank would have
to battle inflation soon, especially at a critical time when
consumers and investors are losing faith in the U.S. stock markets.</TE>
<TE>   Separate data from the Labor Department showed new applications
for state unemployment benefits rose last week.</TE>
<TE>   These initial claims rose by 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted
six-week high of 403,000. But the weekly data, a department official
said, are volatile this time of year and hard to seasonally adjust as
auto makers and others begin annual shutdowns at their plants.</TE>
<TE>   The four-week moving average, considered a more reliable gauge of
employment conditions because it irons out weekly fluctuations,
inched up to 395,000 from 393,000.</TE>
<TE>   Even with an uncertain outlook for the stock market, consumers are
continuing to spend, separate reports Thursday showed.</TE>
<TE>   June same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year,
exceeded those of May, when unusually cool weather slowed sales of
seasonal goods such as air conditioners and grills. Retailers finally
were rewarded with above-normal temperatures across most of the
United States in June.</TE>
<TE>   Retailers tracked by Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi chalked up a
same-store sales increase of 5.1%, essentially in line with the
bank's expectation of 5%.</TE>

<HD>Approval Delayed on Inhaled Vaccine</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: FDA has 68 questions on clinical and
manufacturing data for MedImmune's FluMist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The approval process for the first inhaled flu vaccine received
another setback Thursday as the government sought more information
about it from drug maker MedImmune Inc. The development means that
FluMist may not make it to market by this flu season.</LD>
<LD>   In a conference call with analysts after the markets closed, Chief
Executive David M. Mott said the Food and Drug Administration had 68
questions on manufacturing and clinical data submitted about FluMist.
Mott said most questions were minor and the company was optimistic
that it could respond within the next 30 to 45 days.</LD>
<LD>   But Mott refused to handicap FluMist's chances of reaching the
market by mid-November. Last winter he said the product had a 50% to
50% chance of reaching the market for the 2002 flu season.</LD>
<TE>   "Timelines for launch this year are tight," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mott did say he was confident the product would be approved and
available for the 2003 season.</TE>
<TE>   MedImmune received FluMist as part of its $1.6-billion acquisition
of Menlo Park-based Aviron in November. Aviron, now called MedImmune
Vaccines, submitted its application to the FDA in October 2000. Last
summer, a government review panel raised numerous safety questions
about the drug, which uses a live influenza virus and is squirted
into the nose. Other vaccines use a dead virus.</TE>
<TE>   Mott said the FDA still had questions about the safety of using
the vaccine in children younger than 3, particularly those who have
asthma. The agency is concerned about an elevated incidence of asthma
and wheezing in asthmatic toddlers who tried the vaccine, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mott said the company may not be able to market the vaccine to
children younger than 3, a key group for the vaccine. However, Mott
said that they account for just 6 million of the 174 million
potential users of the vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   On the manufacturing front, the FDA has questions about
MedImmune's plans for quality testing, Mott said.</TE>
<TE>   The company is continuing to gear up for the coming flu season in
the hope that the product will be approved in time. It is continuing
to manufacture the drug, and with its marketing partner Wyeth, is
putting its sales force in place. MedImmune said it has the capacity
to sell 4 million doses of vaccine this season.</TE>
<TE>   MedImmune hasn't said what it will charge, but analysts expect it
will be more than the standard $10 charged for a flu shot. The
company has told analysts that it believes the social costs of the
flu work out to $28 to $40 a dose.</TE>
<TE>   FluMist is important to MedImmune. The company posted a
$1.1-billion loss in the first quarter due to a $1.2-billion charge
on the Aviron acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Maryland-based MedImmune rose $3.36 to close at $24.46
on Nasdaq on news that the FDA did not ask for additional clinical
trials.</TE>

<HD>Late Buyers Curtail Steep Slide</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: The Dow edges lower after falling as much as
208 points in early trading. Nasdaq and S&amp;P end higher.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Key stock indexes closed modestly higher Thursday as bargain hunters
rushed into the market at midday, halting another steep slide in blue
chips.</LD>
<LD>   The turnaround, on very heavy trading volume, raised hopes that
the market might be stabilizing. But analysts noted that those hopes
have been dashed many times in recent months.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average was off as much as 208 points in
early trading, after falling 565 points from Monday through
Wednesday. But a flurry of buying in the final half of the session
lifted the Dow to a close of 8,801.53, for a loss of 11.97 points on
the day.</LD>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index closed with a gain of 6.90 points,
or 0.8%, at 927.37, while the Nasdaq composite rose 28.42 points, or
2.1%, to 1,374.43.</TE>
<TE>   New York Stock Exchange trading volume was the sixth-busiest ever.
Traders said some of the buying resulted from institutional
computer-generated purchase programs triggered when key indexes hit
certain lows.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts and money managers say stocks are becoming cheap by
many measures, with the S&amp;P down 19.2% this year and Nasdaq down
29.5%, and with the economy recovering.</TE>
<TE>   But the wave of corporate financial scandals hasn't shown signs of
abating, and that remains one of the biggest threats to share prices,
experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, drug giant Bristol-Myers Squibb said Thursday that its
accounting is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Bristol shares closed down $1.04 at $22.11, though they
bounced from a low of $19.49.</TE>
<TE>   "What the stock market needs more than anything is time and no
more scandals," said Brian Belski, market strategist at US Bancorp
Piper Jaffray. "We have to get to the point where we say that the
values are too good to ignore, and then this crisis in confidence
goes away. We're not there yet."</TE>
<TE>   The market got a lift Thursday after Barton Biggs, a well-known
investment strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York, told clients in
a memo that "this is no time to be selling stocks," with prices
depressed. Biggs, who has been largely bearish on the market in
recent years, said that although he doesn't expect a new bull market
to be imminent, "I do think that investors can make money in the
short run."</TE>
<TE>   Blue chips also were buoyed after Eastman Kodak said
second-quarter earnings will be about 85 cents a share, excluding
one-time items. Analysts had expected 63 cents, according to Thomson
First Call. Kodak said its restructuring program is paying off sooner
than expected.</TE>
<TE>   Kodak, a Dow index component, jumped $2.94 to $29.58.</TE>
<TE>   Technology investors were encouraged that the Nasdaq index
performed better than the S&amp;P 500 for a third straight session. That
could be an indication that the battered tech sector is bottoming,
some said.</TE>
<TE>   In the semiconductor sector, where the average stock is down 29%
this year after falling 9% last year and 18% in 2000, "You've got
valuations that are looking much more reasonable," Mark Edelstone,
Morgan Stanley's chip-stock analyst, told Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   Intel jumped $1.44 to $18.25, Broadcom rose $1.71 to $18.77 and
Micron Technology gained $1.07 to $22.35.</TE>
<TE>   Falling stocks still outnumbered winners by 20 to 15 on Nasdaq and
by 20 to 13 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts said today's trading could be a key test: If stocks
can sustain Thursday's turnaround the market's bulls might get the
upper hand, at least in the near term.</TE>
<TE>   Many pros remain wary. In recent months, "The attitude on Main
Street and Wall Street has changed from buying on the dips to selling
on the rallies," said Richard A. Dickson, a technical analyst at
Hilliard Lyons in Louisville, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading Thursday, the dollar continued to slide against
the yen, falling to a nine-month low of 116.81 yen, from 117.62
Wednesday. The euro rose again, ending at 99.2 cents in New York, up
from 98.9 cents.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar's continuing weakness suggests foreigners are selling
U.S. stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Among Thursday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Beaten-down tech and telecom shares up sharply included Verizon
Communications, up $1.50 to $37.60; KLA Tencor, up $3.28 to $43.81;
and Agilent Technologies, up $1.46 to $23.55.</TE>
<TE>   After regular trading ended, Dell Computer said its second-quarter
earnings will beat expectations. That could boost tech issues today.</TE>
<TE>   * Second-quarter earnings reports or forecasts moved stocks,
including Hershey Foods, up $1.66 to $63.46, and Dow Jones, down
$1.26 to $43.90. Yahoo rose 73 cents to $12.92 in the wake of its
earnings report Wednesday and despite a downgrade by Merrill Lynch to
"reduce/sell."</TE>
<TE>   * Most drug stocks rebounded despite the Bristol-Myers news. Merck
rose 71 cents to $44.28 and Pfizer gained $1.57 to $32.60.</TE>
<TE>   * Defense stocks were a weak spot. General Dynamics fell $4.66 to
$98.60 and Northrop Grumman lost $3.19 to $113.92.</TE>
<TE>   * European markets skidded again. The French market lost 4% and
the German market sank 1.7%.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Visx Inc., the biggest maker of lasers used to correct vision,
reported a quarterly profit slightly below expectations and said
earnings for the rest of the year will miss forecasts.</LD>
<LD>   The firm earned $5.92 million, or 11 cents a share, in the second
quarter, compared with a loss of $10.7 million, or 19 cents, a year
earlier, helped by cost-cutting. Analysts on average were expecting a
profit of 12 cents. In the year-ago quarter, Visx had a cost of $37.8
million, or 40 cents a share, for settling antitrust lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   Sales fell 24% to $36.6 million amid a decline in demand for
vision-correction surgery.</LD>
<TE>   Visx forecast earnings of 15 cents to 18 cents in the second half
on lower sales, compared with expectations of 27 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Santa Clara, Calif-based Visx fell as much as 11% in

<HD>Lawyers Blast Waiver of Workers' Rights</HD>
<DH>Courts: Attorneys say WorldCom is forcing employees to
forfeit legal rights in return for pay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS and LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attorneys for WorldCom Inc. employees say the company is improperly
trying to limit future claims and participation in class-action
lawsuits by forcing workers to sign away their legal rights in return
for severance pay and paid health benefits.</LD>
<LD>   The attorneys Thursday asked a judge to order WorldCom to stop
distributing the so-called general release agreements and to recall
the agreements already in circulation among laid-off employees.</LD>
<LD>   The court agreed to consider the request at an expedited hearing
set for Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.</LD>
<TE>   Telecommunications giant WorldCom, teetering on the verge of
bankruptcy amid a vast accounting scandal, is laying off more than
17,000 employees to save money.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton, Miss.-based company is offering dismissed employees
severance pay and paid health insurance--but only if they sign an
agreement, within 10 days, that relieves the company, its officers,
executives and others from liability in all potential claims and
lawsuits, including suits already underway.</TE>
<TE>   Such broadly framed liability releases have become common among
large corporations, and have been upheld as legal in many
circumstances as long as the signing employees are adequately
informed before waiving their rights, employment law experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Companies are restricted from making earned wages and accrued
vacation pay contingent on waiver agreements.</TE>
<TE>   But if a company offers anything in addition to what it is legally
or contractually required to provide in severance, it can ask for a
waiver of rights in return, said Rene Barge, a West Los Angeles
employment lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "That's fair, that's legitimate," she said. "I give you something
and you give me something in return. I've had a lot of people call me
and say they want the money and they want to sue, and I have to say,
'Sorry.' "</TE>
<TE>   In WorldCom's case, a series of fraud investigations at the
company are in their infancy, making it impossible for employees to
have complete information before signing a waiver, according to
attorney A. J. De Bartolomeo. Her firm sued the company this month on
behalf of employees whose retirement accounts were decimated when
WorldCom's stock plummeted below $1 a share.</TE>
<TE>   "What's different about this case is that it releases the future
and current officers and directors and the company for wrongdoing of
any kind, and at a time when the company's executives just took the
5th Amendment before Congress," De Bartolomeo said.</TE>
<TE>   "What WorldCom is trying to do here is to buy themselves an
insurance policy against illegal acts," she said. "It's particularly
egregious, because they are asking people to sign away rights which
are the subject of lawsuits right now, not some lawsuit that could be
filed in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Julie Moore, a spokeswoman for WorldCom, said the company would
not comment on the issue because it is the subject of litigation.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom has been sued by at least nine other law firms over
alleged violations of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security
Act, or ERISA.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuits accuse the company of fraudulently hiding the firm's
true financial condition from employees whose retirement money was
invested in WorldCom stock.</TE>
<TE>   The release agreement being distributed by the company could
prevent employees who sign it from participating in lawsuits
involving ERISA claims.</TE>
<TE>   Given that scenario, "there might even be an unconscionability
argument that their use of these agreements is deceptive or abusive,"
said attorney Barge. "But it depends on what the employees are
getting. If they are getting something they already deserve, then
they shouldn't sign it."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., which recently paid $100 million to settle New
York charges that it gave tainted bullish advice on Internet stocks
in the tech sector's heyday, has turned negative on one of the
sector's flagships.</LD>
<LD>   Merrill analyst Justin Baldauf cut his rating on Yahoo Inc. to
"reduce/sell" from "neutral."</LD>
<LD>   He called the stock "very expensive" one day after Yahoo reported
its first quarterly profit after six quarters of losses.</LD>
<TE>   Merrill has promised harder-hitting stock research in the wake of
the New York settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The market appeared to ignore Baldauf on Thursday: Yahoo shares
rose 73 cents to $12.92 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>Dell Computer Corp. said strong personal computer sales to schools,
government and consumers are expected to boost fiscal second-quarter
revenue to $8.3 billion, up from the $8.2 billion the company had
predicted in May.</LD>
<LD>   Because the company continues to win market share from
competitors, Dell said it expects to report earnings of 19 cents a
share in the quarter ending Aug. 2. Analysts surveyed by Thomson
First Call expected 18 cents.</LD>
<LD>   If Thursday's prediction holds, Dell earnings would rise 19% from
year-earlier results and revenue would rise 9%. Dell is scheduled to
announce results Aug. 15.</LD>
<TE>   Dell made the announcement after markets closed. The stock gained
26 cents to $23.93 in regular Nasdaq trading, and rose as high as
$25.40 after hours.</TE>

<BD>Dow Jones/Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Xerox Corp. said it misallocated its 2001 interest expense in its
annual report, but the mistake won't affect the company's reported
net loss for the year. In an amended regulatory filing, the copier
company said it shifted $16 million among the four quarters of 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The adjustment of Xerox's interest expense increased its net
income for the first quarter of 2001 by $5 million, narrowed its
second-quarter loss by $3 million, widened its third-quarter loss by
$16 million and narrowed its fourth-quarter loss by $8 million.</LD>
<LD>   Last month Xerox restated its financial results for 1997 to 2001
as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
which found that the company improperly accelerated its revenue
recognition.</LD>

<HD>Liberty Chief May Bid for Vivendi Assets</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: John Malone says he won't rule out an offer.
Some say Barry Diller may buy all or part of the firm's U.S.
business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Malone, the billionaire chairman of Liberty Media Corp., said he
won't rule out bidding for some of the entertainment assets of
Vivendi Universal, which is in turmoil after former Chief Executive
Jean-Marie Messier last week resigned under pressure.</LD>
<LD>   Some investors say Barry Diller, head of Vivendi's U.S. television
and film business, may buy all or part of the firm's U.S. assets.
Other possible bidders include Malone.</LD>
<LD>   "I won't rule it out," Malone said, speaking after the morning
presentations at Allen &amp; Co.'s annual invitation-only conference in
Idaho for billionaires, entertainers and top media executives. "It
all depends on whether there's value there," he added.</LD>
<TE>   Messier was scheduled to address the conference, but those in
attendance said he failed to show. A hastily-put-together panel,
featuring such moguls as Diller, Warren Buffett, Jeffrey Katzenberg
and Howard Stringer served as a substitute. The topic: corporate
governance of branding.</TE>
<TE>   In Paris, meanwhile, Vivendi Universal board member Marc Vienot
said the company's new chief executive, Jean-Rene Fourtou, is there
"to stay" and wasn't chosen only as a temporary replacement to
Messier.</TE>
<TE>   "I picked him," Vienot, Societe Generale's honorary chairman, told
reporters at an investor conference. The 63- year-old Fourtou, who is
the No. 2 on drug maker Aventis' supervisory board, "had to be
persuaded," Vienot said.</TE>
<TE>   Messier resigned under pressure last week after his $77 billion of
takeovers caused Vivendi's stock to fall 77% this year, raised debt
to $16.7 billion and prompted Moody's Investors Service to cut the
company's credit rating to "junk."</TE>
<TE>   Before Fourtou was appointed last week, newspaper reports said he
would stay at Vivendi between six months and a year.</TE>
<TE>   In other developments at Vivendi, Universal Pictures agreed to a
multi-year contract with Peter Guber's Mandalay Pictures to finance
and distribute films made by the independent production company.</TE>
<TE>   Financial terms weren't disclosed. Mandalay previously had a
contract for nearly five years with Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Pictures,
the companies said.</TE>
<TE>   Before moving to Paramount in 1998, Mandalay had been based at
Sony Corp., where Guber was studio chief.</TE>
<TE>   Mandalay's current projects in development include "Saint of
Dragon's," "Maneater," from the novel to be published next year, and
"The Jacket," produced by George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh's
Section 8.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Wyeth Hit With Class Action Alleging Damage From Drug</HD>
<DH>Courts: The lawsuit follows a study that found increased
health risks to women who take the Prempro hormone replacement
therapy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wyeth Inc. was slapped with a class-action lawsuit Thursday following
a study released this week that identified increased health risks to
women from the company's Prempro hormone replacement therapy.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit was filed on behalf of women who allege that the
hormone replacement has damaged them, said the law firm Schiffrin &amp;
Barroway. The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia,
seeks the establishment of a medical monitoring fund for all women
who have taken Prempro, plus refunds for all Prempro users and
compensation for "all victims for personal injuries and death."</LD>
<LD>   In the suit, plaintiff June Bloch contends that Wyeth officials
knew Prempro caused "serious side effects" in some users.
"Nevertheless, they continued to market the product by providing
false and misleading information with regard to its safety," the suit
said.</LD>
<TE>   Bloch, who has not been diagnosed with breast cancer or other
Prempro-linked illness, is asking a judge to order Wyeth to pay for
her medical checkups after the disclosures about the drug.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Schiffrin &amp; Barroway were unavailable Thursday
to give details about the size of the class or who might qualify.</TE>
<TE>   Hormone replacement therapy is used by millions of post-menopausal
women to treat symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, mood
swings and vaginal dryness.</TE>
<TE>   Wyeth spokesman Douglas Petkus said the company had not received
documentation on the lawsuit, adding that "we don't think that there
is any legal or factual basis for any claims against Wyeth and
Prempro, or any related to the study."</TE>
<TE>   The National Institutes of Health study, which was halted because
of concerns about health risks to the more than 16,000 female
participants, found that healthy women who take Prempro in the long
term faced a slight but significant increase in risk for breast
cancer, heart disease, blood clots and strokes.</TE>
<TE>   The suit is more bad news for Wyeth, which reserved $13.2 billion
to settle lawsuits by dieters who claimed its diet drug fen-phen
damaged heart valves. The company changed its name from American Home
Products Corp. this year.</TE>
<TE>   Prempro is one of Wyeth's bestsellers, with sales of more than $2
billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   Wyeth should brace itself for more suits by Prempro users seeking
to force the company to pay for cancer and stroke screening, said
Stephen Sheller, a Philadelphia-based plaintiffs attorney who
represented dieters in fen-phen lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   "You are going to have a bunch of cases seeking medical monitoring
and claiming the company unjustly enriched itself by selling this
drug," said Sheller, who is not involved in Bloch's suit.</TE>
<TE>   Wyeth shares rose 65 cents to close at $36.40 on the New York
Stock Exchange. The shares have fallen 39% since the disclosure this
week about Prempro's potential health risks.</TE>

<LD>Karen Caplan runs a produce distributing business in Los Alamitos
that has seen its energy costs rise 38% this year, despite a series
of steps to cut power consumption.</LD>
<LD>   Utilities and state officials are urging conservation to help
prevent blackouts and shortages during the current heat wave, but
Caplan and other business owners say they already are doing all they
can to cut usage.</LD>
<LD>   Caplan said her workers turn down lights in the office during peak
energy-use periods and cut the number of copy machines left on every
day. The company also installed an energy-saving air- conditioning
system.</LD>
<TE>   Caplan tried turning down the cooling systems in
temperature-controlled rooms, but the floors "sweated" and created a
safety hazard, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that we really exhausted the options with what we did,"
said Caplan, president and chief executive of Frieda's Inc. and the
daughter of company founder Frieda Caplan. "We could move out of the
state--that would save energy. [But] when you're in a building with a
long-term lease, you don't have a lot of options."</TE>
<TE>   Other companies echo Caplan's complaint, saying the only thing
left would be to shut operations--which they reject as too costly.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've maxed out on conservation measures--unless we
started using flashlights," said Victor Franco, a spokesman for the
Miller Brewing plant in Irwindale. "We honestly feel that we are at
our limit."</TE>
<TE>   The Miller brewery, which employs 750, has energy-saving
lightbulbs and shuts operations including steam-generating systems
and cold storage when they are not necessary to keep production
flowing.</TE>
<TE>   But Miller pulled out of an interruptible-power program designed
to help the utilities weather shortages. Under the program, customers
that agreed to have their power cut during shortages got a discount
price for electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Franco said the power emergencies in 2000 and 2001 came much more
often than many businesses expected, and for Miller Brewing the cost
of shutting down was so high that the plant temporarily shifted some
of its production schedule to other facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided that being on the interruptible rate was not the best
business decision," Franco said.</TE>
<TE>   Miller isn't the only company to back out of the
interruptible-power program.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California Edison won't reveal the number of customers
that remain on the plan. But the utility, a unit of Edison
International in Rosemead, says it has about 650 megawatts assigned
to interruptible customers--compared with more than 1,000 megawatts
last year. One megawatt fuels 500 to 1,000 homes.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses Fear Outages</TE>
<TE>   As bad as high prices are, most business owners seem to agree that
unscheduled power outages are worse.</TE>
<TE>   At Integrated Micromachines Inc., an optical switch manufacturer
in Monrovia, the electricity bills soar higher than the rent during
the summer, said Art Huskey, chief operating officer. This summer, he
is expecting monthly electricity bills as high as $70,000, compared
with $50,000 for rent.</TE>
<TE>   But "the biggest concern I have is unplanned outages," he said,
noting that an unscheduled interruption can shut operations for two
days.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very severe, especially for manufacturers," said Jack
Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology
Assn. "If you're a manufacturer in California, you either have to be
more productive in your operations or you're not going to survive."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, California has cut its energy use. Monthly peak
electricity demand was 11.2% lower in June compared with two years
earlier, said California Energy Commission spokeswoman Claudia
Chandler.</TE>
<TE>   But price remains an issue. Stewart said a recent study
commissioned by the manufacturers association and conducted by the
Milken Institute showed that California energy costs average 93%
higher than the national average.</TE>
<TE>   "When companies get those higher [energy] rates, they juggle them
for a couple of months, and then they see they're unable to continue
to be profitable," Stewart said. "What happens is they start laying
off workers or they start moving plants to other states."</TE>
<TE>   Rod Van Bebber, senior vice president of distribution at
cooperative-owned wholesaler Unified Western Grocers in Commerce,
also is concerned about higher electricity rates and signs of
continued energy supply problems.</TE>
<TE>   Tough on Smaller Stores</TE>
<TE>   For independent grocers that compete with nationwide chains such
as Albertson's Inc., Ralphs parent Kroger Co. and Vons parent Safeway
Inc., "it can be a death knell to them," Van Bebber said.</TE>
<TE>   "California's already a very expensive state to do business in,"
Van Bebber said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce President and Chief Executive
Rusty Hammer said businesses need longer-term solutions beyond
conservation to stabilize California's energy market.</TE>
<TE>   "We may dodge another bullet, but we're not going to dodge that
forever," Hammer said. "Ultimately what's going to have to happen is
there's going to have to be regulatory stability, and there's going
to have to be a commitment to more capacity."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some businesses are finding ways to cut energy usage.</TE>
<TE>   Retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and
Target Corp. are receiving rebates from the California Energy
Commission for replacing or resurfacing their roofs with paler,
energy-conserving ones.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart, for example, is set to receive nearly $50,000 in rebates
for two stores in Corona, the commission said.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer John in Vernon is another company ready to make
energy-saving changes this summer, by raising refrigeration
temperatures in its pork-processing operations, said spokesman Ron
Smith.</TE>
<TE>   But Smith said Vernon's municipal utility has yet to call on
Farmer John to cut energy usage.</TE>

<HD>SEC Probes Sales at Bristol-Myers</HD>
<DH>Drugs: Inquiry centers on whether the firm made timely
disclosure about revenue tactics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Drug giant Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., already in hot water with
investors for a series of missteps, is facing regulatory scrutiny
over its aggressive sales incentives that bolstered revenue by $1
billion last year.</LD>
<LD>   The probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission, disclosed
Thursday, appears to center on whether Bristol-Myers made appropriate
and timely disclosure to investors about the sales tactics that led
to excess wholesaler inventories. Those tactics enabled the company
to largely meet analysts' expectations last year but are now hurting
the company's sales as wholesalers work off the inventories.</LD>
<LD>   Bristol-Myers said Thursday that it has been in discussions with
the SEC since April, when the company disclosed the effect of the
inventory glut. In a short statement, the company said it believed
its accounting treatment of excess inventory was completely
appropriate.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   But the fact that another corporation--and a big pharmaceutical
company at that--was being targeted by regulators set off another
frantic day on Wall Street. This week, Merck &amp; Co. said it had
recorded more than $12 billion in sales from drug co-payments that it
did not collect, further dimming investors' confidence in the
pharmaceutical industry.</TE>
<TE>   For Bristol-Myers, news of the SEC probe was the latest setback
and cast darker shadows over the company and its chief executive,
Peter Dolan, who has struggled amid missteps that have included an
ill-advised investment in ImClone Systems Inc., which itself is under
regulatory scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why [Dolan] has survived as long as he has," said
Barbara Ryan, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York.
Ryan said that under Dolan, Bristol-Myers has shown a pattern of not
being forthcoming about material information involving the company.
Citing one example, she said it took the company several months
before it disclosed in March negative test results on a hypertension
drug that it is trying to get through government approval.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts, however, were not surprised by the news of the SEC
investigation, saying it was expected given the current regulatory
pressures and the way Bristol-Myers jolted investors in April when it
disclosed the extent of a risky practice that's known in the drug
industry as "channel-stuffing."</TE>
<TE>   It is not uncommon for drug makers to drive sales with wholesalers
by giving discounts upfront or providing favorable payment terms,
although the amount of the channeling is much smaller than the
billion dollars worth that Bristol-Myers did last year. For the
industry as a whole, these incentives account for 5% to 15% of sales
to wholesalers, said Andrew Speller, an analyst at A.G. Edwards &amp;
Sons in St. Louis. The sales are booked as revenue to the drug
makers, and wholesalers cannot return the products, he said, except
in the rare case that they sit in warehouses long enough to expire.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Bristol-Myers put through aggressive incentives last
year because sales of other products were slower than expected. But
in booking an additional $1 billion in revenue this way, some
analysts said, the company did not warn investors until April about
the potential effect the excess inventories would have on sales this
year. In April, Bristol-Myers substantially lowered its revenue and
earnings estimates for this year.</TE>
<TE>   "These are real sales ....The problem comes in that as they were
doing this, did they make disclosures to the investors?" said Richard
Lawrence, an analyst at Parker/Hunter Inc., a brokerage in
Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence said the SEC investigation was not changing his outlook
for the company, which as with most analysts has been significantly
lowered this year.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of New York-based Bristol-Myers declined $1.04, or 4%, to
$22.11 on the New York Stock Exchange, although they had fallen
earlier in the day by as much as 16% to a five-year low. The stock is
down 54% since the start of the year. The company reported revenue of
$4.1 billion for its first quarter, down 13% from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Stout, professor of law specializing in securities regulation
at UCLA, said that public companies are not required to disclose
right away as much information as many people think, although many
firms do so. But when they make required quarterly and annual
filings, they are obligated to disclose material information.</TE>
<TE>   With Bristol-Myers, she said, the central question for the SEC
appears to be: "Were there filings that left out the information at a
time when the company knew it was material ... or alternatively, did
the company make any voluntary disclosures, speeches or meetings that
were misleading?"</TE>
<TE>   Although Bristol-Myers refused to comment beyond its statement
Thursday, analysts said a good chunk of the $1 billion in extra
revenue garnered last year came from the diabetes treatment
Glucophage. Bristol-Myers had strong reason to encourage wholesalers
to load up on the drug because it was set to come off patent in
February of this year.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear when Bristol-Myers knew about the full effect of the
generic competition, which led to a buildup of Glucophage on
wholesaler shelves.</TE>

<HD>Exodus From Stock Funds Continues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stock mutual funds are facing net outflows of cash for the first time
since September, as small investors step up their selling amid Wall
Street's steep decline.</LD>
<LD>   But that throw-in-the-towel mentality among fund investors in the
past has signaled that the market was reaching at least a short-term
bottom, analysts say.</LD>
<LD>   Hopes for a timeout in the bear market were bolstered Thursday, as
key indexes recovered from sharp losses to close mostly higher. The
Nasdaq composite finished with a gain of 28.42 points, or 2.1%, at
1,374.43, and the Dow industrials pulled up from a 208-point loss to
end at 8,801.53, off 11.97 points.</LD>
<TE>   Stock mutual funds have been a major source of support for the
market since the early 1990s: Nearly every month in the last decade
the funds have taken in more cash from new fund purchases than has
left from investor redemptions.</TE>
<TE>   In June, however, stock funds suffered net withdrawals for the
first time since September, according to estimates, and analysts say
outflows have persisted this month as people have shifted cash toward
fixed-income investments, real estate and other options.</TE>
<TE>   According to AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif., domestic stock
funds have seen six straight weeks of net outflows, a longer streak
than the exodus that occurred before and after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors have been through a lot of pain and for a long time
now," said Don Cassidy, senior research analyst at fund tracker
Lipper Inc. in Denver. "A lot of them are saying, 'I don't care at
what price--just get me out of the market, and I'll never buy another
stock again.' "</TE>
<TE>   But "contrarian" analysts view that attitude as potentially
bullish, because it may indicate that the selling is reaching a peak,
setting the stage for the market to bottom.</TE>
<TE>   Net stock fund redemptions in March 2001 and in September preceded
rallies, Cassidy said.</TE>
<TE>   So far in July, a net $17 billion has been pulled from stock
funds, compared with net redemptions of $20.9 billion for all of
June, according to estimates by TrimTabs Investment Research of Santa
Rosa, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   "This is panic selling," said Charles Biderman, TrimTabs'
president. "We are in the bottoming process, but it could take
awhile."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts hesitate to guess how long the bottoming process might
take--or how much heavier fund redemptions could become before
sellers have exhausted themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The $30-billion outflow in September culminated three straight
months of net withdrawals. Also, investors were net sellers of stock
funds for 16 of 18 months after the 1987 market crash.</TE>
<TE>   "The nature of [investors'] discontent appears to be wide open,"
Cassidy said. "Can anyone say we've seen the final terrorist strike
or the final corporate scandal?"</TE>
<TE>   Investor selling so far has been focused on domestic stock funds,
while foreign stock funds, which generally have performed better this
year and could benefit from continuing weakness in the dollar, have
held their ground.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say fund investors are losing faith in U.S. accounting
and corporate governance standards, given the explosion of financial
scandals. There also may be anxiety over how legislative anti-fraud
efforts in Congress could affect corporate operations.</TE>
<TE>   "A wise person once said that no man's property is safe while the
legislature is in session," Biderman said.</TE>
<TE>   Thus far, redemptions have been moderate and manageable, fund
companies say.</TE>
<TE>   At San Francisco-based Charles Schwab Corp.'s mutual fund
supermarket, a net $192 million was yanked from stock funds last
month, compared with $1.6 billion in September.</TE>
<TE>   At Vanguard Group in Valley Forge, Pa., spokesman Brian Mattes
called June's $105-million net outflow "a trickle" compared with $1.3
billion that left in September.</TE>
<TE>   Although redemptions and exchanges have been light, more people
are directing new cash toward fixed-income funds, Mattes said:
Vanguard's bond funds took in a net $2.9 billion in June, their
best-selling month of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Stock mutual funds hold about $3.3 trillion in assets, about
one-fifth of the market, according to the Investment Company
Institute, the industry's main trade group. Though the funds don't
dominate the market, if fund managers are forced to sell stocks
because of investor redemptions, it can add to downward pressure on
prices.</TE>
<TE>   Many stock funds hold a cash "cushion" to tap in the event of
redemptions. But that cushion has grown thinner since the early
1990s. Cash holdings in stock funds totaled 5.1% of assets at the end

<HD>Gores' Bid Expected for Global Crossing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The deadline for bidding on all or parts of Global Crossing Ltd. was
extended Thursday to as late as midnight, and two Los Angeles
brothers making a joint offer for the troubled fiber-optic network
builder ironed out minor details late in the day as they prepared to
file.</LD>
<LD>   Spokesmen for separate buyout firms headed by financiers Tom and
Alec Gores said the combined bid would be "substantially higher" than
an initial offer by two Asian companies, which creditors rejected as
inadequate and which the companies withdrew.</LD>
<LD>   The Asian companies, Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. in Hong Kong and
Singapore Technologies Telemedia, proposed paying $750 million in
cash for 79% of Global Crossing. Creditors would have received 21% of
the company and $300 million in cash, with the rest going into the
company to fund operations.</LD>
<TE>   Global had $12.4 billion in debt when the holding company and 55
subsidiaries filed what became the nation's fourth-largest bankruptcy
Jan. 28. The debtors owe $8 billion, and units that are not in
bankruptcy, primarily 59%-owned Asia Global Crossing Ltd., owe the
rest.</TE>
<TE>   The Gores brothers' spokesmen said the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
New York granted a delay in filing the proposal. They said only minor
details needed attention but would not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   The bidding process is secret until sometime after a private
auction is held July 24. A number of companies have stated their
intentions--and most decided not to make any offers.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon Communications Inc. reportedly said it did not make a bid,
and AT&amp;T Corp. had been cool toward Global's network and the three
main units that are not part of the core long-distance voice and data
operation.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, VoiceLogix Inc. of Rochester, N.Y., worked throughout
the night Wednesday but decided early Thursday not to bid for
Global's teleconferencing unit.</TE>
<TE>   The joint offer from Tom Gores' Platinum Equity and Alec Gores'
Gores Technology Group may be the only major bid for Global's
worldwide high-speed cable system, which connects 200 cities in 27
countries.</TE>

<HD>Housing Affordability Plummets</HD>
<DH>Economy: In California, 27% of people can purchase a
median-priced home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Housing affordability plunged sharply in May, as steep gains in
prices statewide prevented more people from owning homes even as
mortgage rates edged down, a report released Thursday showed.</LD>
<LD>   The percentage of those able to purchase a median-priced home
dropped to 27% in May from 34% a year earlier, according to the
monthly report compiled by the California Assn. of Realtors.</LD>
<LD>   The rate from April to May of this year was unchanged.</LD>
<TE>   It marked the second straight month that the statewide index has
recorded a decline of seven percentage points on a year-to-year
basis, keeping affordability at its lowest level in 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   In May, median prices, meaning half cost less and half cost more,
rose 25% to $321,130.</TE>
<TE>   "Any improvement in affordability attributable to reductions in
mortgage rates have been offset at the state level by a steep
increase in median prices," said Robert Bailey, president of the
California Assn. of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   Although agreeing that home prices have risen faster than incomes,
other analysts disagreed with the findings. The index fails to
measure the edge steep equity gains have given buyers, helping to
make up for incomes.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, "affordability has remained fairly constant or
has improved a little bit," said Mark Robbins Boud, a housing
consultant at Real Estate Economics in Laguna Niguel.</TE>
<TE>   Sales have risen significantly over the last year, he said. "To
say that affordability is significantly worse when we're getting a
[big] increase in sales volume doesn't make sense," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Low mortgage rates have created an enormous number of buyers, but
the increase in prices makes it harder for renters to become
homeowners. To purchase a median-priced home, buyers need an income
of $70,100 compared with $61,100 from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Potential sellers have been inhibited from moving up because they
find less home for their money, a key factor behind the supply of
unsold homes on the market to put the state on track for the fifth
straight year of record lows, the Realtors group said.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, the index declined to 32% from a year
earlier at 37%; Orange County declined to 22% from 29%; Ventura
dropped to 32% from 39%. Riverside and San Bernardino counties edged
down to 44% from 47%. The rate nationwide is 56%.</TE>

<HD>Shares of ICN Sink on Lower Expectations</HD>
<DH>Drugs: The firm warns that second-quarter income could be
less than half as much as forecast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIANN WALSH</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. shares fell 53%, their steepest drop ever,
after the Costa Mesa-based drug maker said second-quarter earnings
were at least 50% less than forecast.</LD>
<LD>   The company last month changed management when its founder, Milan
Panic, retired as chairman and chief executive after losing a proxy
fight. Chief Executive Robert W. O'Leary said in a conference call
that several distributors would be reducing bloated inventories "well
into next year," and that the company was evaluating its plan to spin
off its Ribapharm business.</LD>
<LD>   "We are first and foremost going to review the operations,"
O'Leary said. "There is no question [inventories] were above industry
norms, and we made the decision to proactively take them down.
Perhaps the eye got taken off the ball here, and those levels were
allowed to climb higher than they should have."</LD>
<TE>   Profit before certain costs and gains was 15 cents to 20 cents a
share, lower than the 44-cent average estimate of four analysts
surveyed by Thomson First Call, ICN said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the maker of hepatitis drugs, antibiotics, sedatives and
vitamins dropped $10.65 to $9.30 on the New York Stock Exchange in
trading of 19.9 million shares, more than 20 times the three-month
daily average.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman David Calef said ICN would not discuss which products
are affected by the inventory reduction until it reports complete
results Aug. 7.</TE>
<TE>   "The information we've been given increases the uncertainty," said
pharmaceutical analyst Richard Stover of Arnhold &amp; S. Bleichroeder.
"Even after the call, we still don't have sufficient information to
generate accurate earnings estimates for the balance of this year or
next. This market brutally punishes uncertainty."</TE>
<TE>   ICN said it had net income after a $250-million gain associated
with the April initial public stock offering of Ribapharm Inc., a
drug maker in which ICN retains a stake of about 80%. The unit makes
ribavirin, a hepatitis drug.</TE>
<TE>   ICN said it had about $150 million in expenses related to stock
options and other employee compensation, bonuses for the Ribapharm
offering, costs for a proxy contest and the write-off of research and
development from a recent acquisition. The company also spent about
$30 million to repurchase debt.</TE>
<TE>   ICN is involved in a lawsuit related to the $300,000 bonuses it
paid to company directors after the Ribapharm offering. The company
plans to form an independent committee to review the payments,
O'Leary said.</TE>
<TE>   ICN also is reviewing its plan to spin off Ribapharm and its ICN
International unit. "Everything is up for review," O'Leary said. "We
won't be taking any of those moves until we proceed with a complete
review of the company."</TE>
<TE>   Today was O'Leary's first conference call with analysts since
becoming interim chief executive 13 days ago.</TE>
<TE>   Ribapharm said it had about $61 million in royalty revenue from
ribavirin, which is marketed by Schering-Plough Corp. The company
said it would meet or beat the 17-cent Thomson First Call estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Ribapharm shares fell $1.59, or 21%, to $5.85 on the NYSE. The
shares have fallen 42% since the April offering.</TE>

<HD>Extension of Promenade Proposed</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Macerich wants to convert the mall adjacent to
the 3rd Street shopping district into an open-air center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Monica Place, the enclosed mall that borders the thriving Third
Street Promenade, would be converted to an open-air district with
street-level shops and upper-level office space and housing under a
plan under review by Santa Monica city officials.</LD>
<LD>   Both city officials and the mall's owner, Macerich Co., a Santa
Monica real estate investment trust, support the concept. City staff
members are drafting a specific plan for the proposal.</LD>
<LD>   Company and city officials said it could be two years before the
start of construction, and there are no cost estimates yet.</LD>
<TE>   The ultimate aim, said Mayor Michael Feinstein, is to improve the
flow of pedestrians between the Promenade, the Santa Monica Municipal
Pier and the soon-to-be-revamped Civic Center to the south and west
of the mall.</TE>
<TE>   "The mall is a major impediment, sitting in the middle, blocking
full circulation among all of those destinations," said Feinstein,
who said he approached Macerich officials with the idea more than a
year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "So if we can remove the blood clot, then the arteries of the city
can flow freely."</TE>
<TE>   Designed by Frank O. Gehry, famed architect and a city resident,
Santa Monica Place opened on Oct. 16, 1980, to throngs of shoppers
who all but abandoned the street-level shops along nearby 3rd Street.</TE>
<TE>   The mall, anchored by Macy's and Robinsons-May, includes about
450,000 square feet of retail space, about 9% of which is vacant,
according to the Santa Monica Place Web site. Other tenants in the
mall include retailers such as Ann Taylor, Eddie Bauer and
Williams-Sonoma.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent years, open-air shopping areas gained in popularity,
especially in such sun-drenched locales as California.</TE>
<TE>   From April 1997 to March 1998, sales tax revenue for the mall and
the Third Street Promenade was virtually even, at about $1.45
million, according to Ralph Bursey, city treasurer.</TE>
<TE>   For the 2001-'02 period, sales tax revenue from the Promenade
jumped to $2.07 million, while revenue from the mall dipped to $1.29
million, city figures show.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the success of Third Street, it made a lot of sense for us
to consider how we might open up Santa Monica Place to both Third
Street and the Civic Center," said Randy Brant, senior vice president
of Macerich, which bought the mall in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "It made sense to de-mall it, if you will, and have it look like a
seamless extension of Third Street," Brant said.</TE>
<TE>   The revised mall would look somewhat like two three-story malls,
with the extended Promenade running through the center, along 3rd
Street.</TE>
<TE>   To accommodate the proposed redesign, Brant and city officials
said, parking structures at 4th Street and Broadway Avenue and at 2nd
Street and Colorado Avenue would have to be demolished and converted
to underground structures.</TE>
<TE>   That would create room for more ground-level space for retail
sites, with as many as 450 housing units, including some affordable
housing, on the upper two floors, Brant said.</TE>
<TE>   Brant said specifics, such as what would happen to rents and
whether current tenants would get first dibs on the new street-level
shops, have not been determined. He said both anchors have made
commitments to stay.</TE>
<TE>   Adding an open-air atmosphere to an existing center has become
more common during the last five years, said Patrice Duker, a
spokeswoman for the New York-based International Council of Shopping
Centers.</TE>
<TE>   "With companies that have older centers, this allows them to try
different design concepts out rather than start from scratch with all
of the land acquisition and [city] entitlement issues involved," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Until Sept. 11, Brant said, the mall averaged about $400 in sales
per square foot, "which put it in the top 10% of all malls in the
U.S. and in our portfolio," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Macerich's portfolio is concentrated in California. The REIT also
owns and operates the Westside Pavilion, Lakewood Center and Los
Cerritos Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Things have changed," said Brant of the seaside overhaul. "There
are a number of malls in our portfolio that have all changed or
repositioned themselves. We know that this can be made better."</TE>

<KH>CRISIS IN CORPORATE AMERICA</KH>
<HD>Stock Options Lavished on Executives Come Under Fire</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Huge grants may provide an incentive for
managers to falsify earnings to keep share prices up, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF and JAMES FLANIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stock options, once considered a valuable tool to link the interests
of corporate executives to those of shareholders, now are being
examined as a potential culprit in the scandals plaguing corporate
America.</LD>
<LD>   From President Bush on down, critics are looking for ways to rein
in the practice of providing top corporate managers with huge grants
of stock options--which give the right to buy company shares at a set
price in the future--after accounting upheavals at a series of major
companies, including WorldCom Inc. and Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Although stock options clearly were not the only culprit in these
scandals, many industry experts believe they provide a compelling
incentive for managers to falsify earnings to keep Wall Street happy,
the stock price up and manager paychecks rising at a rapid clip.</LD>
<TE>   "Stock options have encouraged managers to take risks beyond what
is potentially prudent," said Robert Felton, director of McKinsey &amp;
Co.'s Seattle office. "Because they have so much at stake with these
huge grants, options are also likely to have encouraged some managers
to cheat and cook the books."</TE>
<TE>   About 75% of executive pay is made up of stock options rather than
cash pay, said Peter G. Peterson, head of the Commission on Public
Trust and Private Enterprise for the Conference Board. That creates a
huge incentive to keep earnings up, even during a downturn.</TE>
<TE>   At Enron, former Chairman Kenneth L. Lay exercised $180.3 million
in options from 1998 to the end of 2000, and former Chief Executive
Jeffrey K. Skilling got $111.7 million. During that period, Enron
inflated earnings by hiding losses in off-the-books partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   But stock options have plenty of supporters, who say cash-strapped
companies need to rely on them to attract seasoned workers who
otherwise would demand higher cash pay.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a director of a small company that didn't have any cash
flow," said Frank Vogl, vice chairman of Transparency International,
a nonprofit group dedicated to stamping out corporate and political
corruption worldwide. "The only way you can really pay your
executives is through this promise of pay over time through stock
options."</TE>
<TE>   The wave of corporate meltdowns has sparked an outcry for new
rules or legislation to stop potential abuses and punish wrongdoers.
Although few of these proposals have made it into formal legislation,
more than a dozen ideas are being kicked around Washington, Vogl
said.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) tried unsuccessfully to
force a Senate vote on his proposal to require companies to account
for stock options as an expense, while Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.)
was holding a news conference with senior managers of pension funds,
decrying the effect of corporate malfeasance on the retirement plans
of the average American. Earlier this week, President Bush suggested
a series of reforms, including prison sentences for cheating
corporate managers and requiring greater disclosure of executive pay
costs.</TE>
<TE>   The current environment is a stark departure from the laissez
faire attitude toward executive pay--and the general support for
giving managers significant grants of stock options--during the
1990s, when the stock market was roaring ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Companies were encouraged to lavish options on managers to ensure
that executives were paid in accordance with their companies'
success. As stock prices rose, so would the value of management pay
packages--a formula meant to drive long-term performance in the best
interest of shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   And lavish they did. From 1995 to 1999, the value of stock options
granted to U.S. executives more than quadrupled to $110.5 billion
from $26.5 billion, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York. Although comparable data on the raw value of options
granted in 2000 and 2001 are not available, all indications are that
the largess continued.</TE>
<TE>   A study issued earlier this year by the Investor Responsibility
Research Center notes that companies granted more stock options in
2000 than they had in any of the three prior years on average. IRRC,
which looks at stock options from the standpoint of how much they
dilute the interest of public shareholders, notes that the average
company has a 14.1% "overhang" from stock options. That's how much
the value of each shareholder stake in the company would be reduced
in the future if all outstanding options were exercised.</TE>
<TE>   At some companies, the dilutive effect could be far greater. At
Irvine-based Broadcom Corp., for example, the future effect of
exercising options could run as high as 83.5%, according to the IRRC.
Broadcom has said the company's strategy is to provide little in the
way of cash pay, but substantial stock incentives to all workers.
Still, such potential dilution provides little incentive to public
shareholders, experts contend.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the effect of stock option grants is hidden--disclosed
only in footnotes to corporate financial statements. Some critics
contend that's part of the problem. Companies can write off exercised
stock options as an employment expense--thereby reducing their tax
bills--but they don't have to include the cost of providing them on
their income statements.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, corporate boards have become increasingly generous,
giving managers options on hundreds of thousands of shares at a time.
As the public debate about the role stock options play in so-called
"earnings management" schemes heats up, one solution has gained
widespread support: requiring companies to expense stock options as
they're granted.</TE>
<TE>   "Boards would be brought up short by the impact of expensing stock
options on the earnings statement," said Graef Crystal, a
high-profile compensation consultant. "Right now, they're still
convinced that this is Monopoly money."</TE>
<TE>   However, the idea of expensing stock options is controversial,
partly because there is no general agreement on how to account for
the cost, said Tim Kochis, president of San Francisco financial
planning firm Kochis Fitz. Options can be valued on the day they're
issued, when they're exercised or by complex mathematical formulas.</TE>
<TE>   Still, because options can have a huge effect on a company's
bottom line, momentum for reporting the cost as an ongoing expense is
building.</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's now expenses options when issuing "core
earnings" reports on the companies it follows.</TE>
<TE>   Securities analysts also are beginning to factor in the cost when
issuing reports on the viability of various investments.</TE>
<TE>   A study by Merrill Lynch Global Research finds, for example, that
Microsoft Corp.'s profit would drop by 22% if it expensed options,
but General Electric Co.'s profit would fall only 2%.</TE>
<TE>   However, moving to a system in which options are treated as an
expense that counts against current earnings is likely to take years,
said Dan Marcus, a compensation expert with Mercer Human Resource
Consulting in Los Angeles. The technical issue of how to value the
options is simply too tricky to come up with a formula that works
consistently, experts agree.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, options--particularly when provided to
rank-and-file workers--are a valuable benefit that's too positive to
lose, said a spokesman for Boxer. Requiring stock options to be
expensed is likely to restrict their use, and legislators such as
Boxer believe that would be wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the momentum is there--fueled by big pension funds
and institutional shareholders such as TIAA-CREF. The reason is not
options, per se, but trust, some experts contend.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a near hysteria about stock options--an almost Robin
Hood mentality about taking them from the rich," Kochis said. "This
is not to limit executive pay. It's just to let us know what the
facts are so that we can make a reasonable judgment."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Rite Aid Corp. Chairman Martin L. Grass and three other
onetime Rite Aid executives pleaded not guilty to federal criminal
charges stemming from their alleged participation in accounting
irregularities intended to make the company more attractive to
investors.</LD>
<LD>   Grass, 47, of Virginia Beach, Va., who doubled as the company's
chairman and chief executive; Franklin Brown, 74, of Harrisburg, Pa.,
the former chief counsel and vice chairman; and Franklyn Bergonzi,
57, of Hummelstown, Pa., a former executive vice president and chief
financial officer, face allegations of conspiracy to defraud, fraud
involving the purchase or sale of securities and making false
statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Also arraigned was Eric S. Sorkin, 53, of Mechanicsburg, Pa.
Sorkin, executive vice president for pharmacy services, was suspended
last month after he was indicted on charges of conspiracy to obstruct
justice and making false statements to a grand jury.</LD>
<TE>   In NYSE trading, Rite Aid shares fell 8 cents to $2.38.</TE>

<LD>   A special committee of Expedia's board of directors, which
considered Diller's offer for the 37% of the Web travel agent that
USA Interactive does not already own, said the company's "stand-alone
prospects continue to be excellent."</LD>

<LD>Eastman Kodak Co. said it expects to report second-quarter profit
that beats expectations because of cost cuts.</LD>
<LD>   The photography company said that excluding a tax gain related to
the closure of a subsidiary and a write-down of assets, it expects
profit of 85 cents a share, well above the 63-cent average estimate
of analysts. Sales will be down for the sixth straight quarter, it
said.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Rochester, N.Y.-based Kodak rose $2.94, or 11%, to
$29.58 on the New York Stock Exchange, their biggest gain in four
years.</LD>

<HD>Ebbers Knew of Scheme, CFO Contends</HD>
<DH>Telecom: WorldCom ex-CEO denies accusations Sullivan made
to company attorneys. Also, MCI Group dividend halted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Ousted WorldCom Inc. Chairman and founder Bernard J. Ebbers knew
about the accounting scheme that allowed the long-distance phone
giant to hide losses totaling $1.2 billion, the former chief
financial officer told company attorneys, who relayed the information
to a House committee.</LD>
<LD>   Scott D. Sullivan, who last month was fired as the top finance
executive at the besieged telecommunications company, told WorldCom
attorneys that Ebbers was aware that hundreds of millions of dollars
had been moved into capital expenditure accounts to make the company
look stronger than it actually was.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom lawyers in turn shared that information with staffers of
the House Energy and Commerce Committee headed by Rep. W.J. "Billy"
Tauzin (R-La.), who is leading the probe into the largest of the
accounting debacles haunting corporate America.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the first evidence we have seen that the muddy footprints
[of the scandal] may lead to Bernie Ebbers' doorsteps," said
committee spokesman Ken Johnson. "Clearly somebody other than
Sullivan knew that somebody was cooking the books."</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers, who once counted Sullivan as his closest lieutenant as the
two men put together a string of deals to build WorldCom over the
last decade, denied Sullivan's accusations in an interview with
committee investigators, Johnson said. Brian Heberlig, who represents
Ebbers at the law firm Steptoe &amp; Johnson, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last few days, committee investigators received five
boxes of documents from WorldCom and interviewed company lawyers who
are conducting an internal investigation of the accounting
irregularities. The committee has been trying to determine who
authorized WorldCom's accounting procedures and whether top
executives other than Sullivan knew about the practices.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan's accusations, if true, would mark a significant setback
for Ebbers, who Monday told the committee that "I do not believe I
have anything to hide in these or any other proceedings." When all
the facts become known, "No one will conclude that I engaged in any
criminal conduct or fraud."</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers declined to answer questions at Monday's hearing. Citing
investigations by the Justice Department and the Securities and
Exchange Commission, he instead invoked his 5th Amendment right
against self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom disclosed last month that it hid $3.9 billion in
operating costs for five quarters--all of last year and the first
quarter of 2002--by classifying it as capital investments.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Worldcom said that it would not pay a $71-million
dividend to shareholders of its long-distance unit, MCI Group.</TE>
<TE>   Reversing a promise 10 days ago that it would pay the MCI
dividend, WorldCom said that "in light of current circumstances" it
would not make the payment, scheduled for Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Cutting the MCI dividend is part of WorldCom's broader effort to
save money by cutting 17,000 jobs and selling an unprofitable
wireless telephone business and other non-core assets such as its
investments in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton, Miss.-based WorldCom, which has $30 billion in
"junk-rated" debt, is in talks to secure $3 billion in funding,
rather than the $5 billion it originally sought. The cost-cutting
measures, as well as the $3 billion in funding, could help the
company meet its interest payments and delay a bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom Chief Executive John W. Sidgmore said Thursday that
"there is a possibility of a [bankruptcy] proceeding if all of our
other options run out," but that he is "cautiously optimistic" that
WorldCom can "obtain the financing required to ensure that the
company can continue to provide service to all of our customers long
into the future."</TE>
<TE>   Sidgmore also said he has "no plans" to cut more jobs at the
company.</TE>
<TE>   MCI had been attractive to many investors because of the high
dividend it paid. Shares of the MCI Group tracking stock plunged on
the news, dropping 17 cents, or 43%, to 22 cents on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom will discontinue the MCI tracking stock today, a year
after it was created to boost shareholder value and differentiate
between the company's telephone and Internet operations.</TE>
<TE>   After the close of trading today, each outstanding share of MCI
Group common stock will be converted into 1.3594 shares of WorldCom
Group common stock. Shares of WorldCom Group, which tracks the
company's main data and Internet business, lost 4 cents, or 21%, to
16 cents on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Does a Balancing Act on Immunity</HD>
<DH>U.N.: The Security Council edges closer to accepting a
tweaked demand to shield American peacekeepers from a new tribunal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>In its battle to shield U.S. peacekeepers from a new international
court, the Bush administration may have to win by losing--or at least
by appearing to retreat a bit--so that key European allies here can
ultimately deliver a compromise.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the administration must reassure foes of the International
Criminal Court in Congress and the Pentagon that the U.S. is not
backing down from its core demand: that American peacekeepers be
guaranteed immunity from prosecution before the tribunal.</LD>
<LD>   To the consternation of the court's staunchest backers, it
appeared Thursday that U.S. diplomats may yet pull off this balancing
act, as a still-divided Security Council edged closer to putting
American soldiers and officials beyond the court's reach.</LD>
<TE>   Throughout the day, council members debated an American proposal
portrayed by Britain and a few others as a significant compromise,
but rejected by court supporters as an unacceptable--and possibly
illegal--infringement of the tribunal's authority.</TE>
<TE>   American diplomats said they hoped for a vote on the measure
today, an indication of confidence that they can get the required
nine-member majority on the 15-nation council.</TE>
<TE>   Informal head counts by European sources showed six members still
strongly opposed to the U.S. proposal, six inclined to support
it--including four of the five permanent members--and three wavering
in between.</TE>
<TE>   A week ago, only China appeared ready to back Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The self-imposed deadline for council action is midnight Monday,
when a U.N. mandate for two peacekeeping missions in
Bosnia-Herzegovina is set to expire.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's new resolution, like its previous proposals,
would preemptively keep the new court from investigating or
prosecuting present, former or future U.S. participants in
U.N.-backed peacekeeping missions. In a change from the last American
proposal, however, the exemption would be in force for 12 months,
instead of being automatically and perpetually renewed.</TE>
<TE>   The apparent concession was hailed by Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's
ambassador to the U.N., "as a positive basis for compromise."</TE>
<TE>   However, the Security Council could and should annually renew the
12-month exemption "for as long as may be necessary," states the U.S.
draft--not a great distinction from past proposals, critics say.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, administration officials rejected suggestions that
the United States was succumbing to European pressure to compromise,
saying little of substance has changed between the new U.S. proposal
and earlier draft resolutions. The American proposal would apply to
all nations that have not signed the treaty that created the court,
including the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The latest text is "fully consistent with our need to protect U.S.
forces and other forces from non-signatory countries," said Sean
McCormack, a National Security Council spokesman. "This idea that
somehow there was a reversal really couldn't be further from the
truth."</TE>
<TE>   At the United Nations, however, U.S. diplomats were conspicuously
avoiding any similarly direct rebuttals of European colleagues who
privately characterized the U.S. position as a retreat.</TE>
<TE>   The revision allows Britain and other backers of the court who are
seeking to end the impasse to claim that they have foiled the
original U.S. demands for an upfront guarantee of immunity in
perpetuity.</TE>
<TE>   In council debates, the U.S. position has received some support
from India and China, while more marginal players--such as Bulgaria,
Singapore and Cameroon--preached the virtue of compromise. But most
council members, along with two dozen other nations that addressed
the body on the issue Wednesday, have challenged the U.S. assertion
that its peacekeepers are at risk of politically motivated or
capricious prosecution by the court.</TE>
<TE>   That dismissive stance infuriates many U.S. officials and
politicians, who say U.S. troops should not be bound by a treaty the
U.S. has not ratified.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it bizarre that some countries appear to be more
interested in exercising criminal jurisdiction over Americans than
they are in enhancing the effectiveness of United Nations
peacekeeping efforts around the world," Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.),
chairman of the House International Relations Committee, said last
week.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional ire notwithstanding, some diplomats have questioned
whether Washington would veto all peacekeeping missions, as it has
threatened to do unless and until the council adopts the special
protections it is seeking.</TE>
<TE>   Jean-David Levitte, the French ambassador to the U.N., noted that
the U.S. has long supported the world body's peacekeeping efforts in
trouble spots where America was not prepared to station its own
troops, such as the U.N. mission along the Lebanese border, which
comes up for renewal later this month.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody questions the major responsibilities shouldered by the
United States, including military responsibilities, but there are
many crises where the U.S. does not want to be directly involved,"
Levitte told the council Wednesday. "There is one solution for these
situations: the blue helmets" of the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   While U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the council this week
that he considered war-crimes prosecutions of peacekeepers "highly
improbable," human rights groups note that U.N.-backed forces in
Africa and the Balkans have been accused of atrocities.</TE>
<TE>   "In seeking to win immunity for its own peacekeepers, the U.S.
could allow peacekeepers such as those from countries with
ineffective legal systems to get away with murder," the Lawyers
Committee for Human Rights said in a statement Thursday opposing the
U.S. proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Some strong supporters of the court suggest that the Pentagon is
right to worry that even U.S. forces under a U.N. mandate could be
exposed to court action. Among the war crimes potentially punishable
by the new court are military actions that are judged to have
targeted noncombatant civilians, a category that Amnesty
International has said could apply to attacks such as the NATO
bombardment of a state television studio in Belgrade during the 1999
war in Yugoslavia, which killed 16 people.</TE>
<TE>   Like its predecessors, the new U.S. resolution would in effect
amend the treaty establishing the court, critics say, exceeding what
they contend are the council's powers under the U.N. Charter.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot amend a treaty through the Security Council, or
otherwise the Security Council becomes the government of the world,"
said David Donat-Cattin, a legal advisor to parliaments seeking to
ratify the court treaty.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, France offered its own resolution. Instead of
granting a blanket exemption to U.S. troops, the French would ask the
court to advise the council of any contemplated action against U.N.
peacekeepers. The council could then exercise its treaty-given right
to halt the investigation or prosecution for up to 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   The French draft, however, does not satisfy U.S. demands for
guaranteed immunity from the court.</TE>
<TE>   French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin met with Secretary
of State Colin L. Powell in Washington on Thursday to see if there
might be some way of melding the French and American proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "We would quite clearly go with anything that the United States
and France could sort out between them," said Greenstock, the British
ambassador.</TE>

flowers at a memorial to more than 7,000 Muslims killed in the town
of Srebrenica seven years ago, the worst civilian massacre in Europe
since World War II.</LD>
<LD>   The estimated 5,000 mourners came from across Bosnia-Herzegovina
to the former silver mining town 50 miles northeast of the capital,
Sarajevo, remembering those killed when Bosnian Serb forces overran
what had been declared a United Nations "safe haven" during the
1992-95 war.</LD>

<HD>Hostages Taken in Violent Protests in Mexico</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Sixteen people were injured and seven police officers and court
officials were taken hostage late Thursday night, after farmers
protesting the construction of a new international airport twice
clashed violently with authorities in Mexico state.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, supporters of Mexico's two major political parties
clashed over a disputed mayoral race in Ciudad Juarez, and eight
people were injured.</LD>
<LD>   The first confrontation over the proposed airport began shortly
after noon, when a caravan of machete-wielding farmers blocked a
large portion of highway near the town of Santa Catarina, about 25
miles northeast of Mexico City.</LD>
<TE>   As authorities arrived on the scene, the protesters began throwing
rocks and attacked the officers, Mexico state spokesman Jesus Jimenez
said.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico State Atty. Gen. Alfonso Navarrete Prida said six officers
were injured in the ensuing battle, including one who was stabbed and
remained in critical condition.</TE>
<TE>   Ten protesters were also injured, and authorities made 15 arrests,
Navarrete said.</TE>
<TE>   Hours later, a second group of protesters burned piles of tires
and used trailers and pickup trucks to block major highways around
San Salvador Atenco, 10 miles to the south.</TE>
<TE>   As traffic leaving Mexico City backed up, protesters clashed
violently with arriving state forces and eventually captured
municipal prosecutor Andres Mendiola and six other police and city
judicial officials, Navarrete said.</TE>
<TE>   Jimenez said the second group of protesters torched six police
cruisers and threatened to burn their hostages alive unless
authorities released those arrested during the first protest.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation there is very, very tense," Jimenez said, adding
that negotiations were underway.</TE>
<TE>   Residents are protesting government attempts to expropriate their
lands for the 11,000-acre, $2.3-billion airport project, which would
swallow up much of San Salvador Atenco.</TE>
<TE>   In Ciudad Juarez, at least eight people were injured, two of them
police officers, and four members of President Vicente Fox's National
Action Party, or PAN, were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   About 200 PAN supporters blocked one of the four bridges leading
over the border into El Paso, Texas, for three hours until the city
government released detained PAN activists.</TE>
<TE>   PAN members are protesting the second consecutive annulment of an
election won by their mayoral candidate.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Says No to Talks in Baghdad</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has rejected an Iraqi invitation to Baghdad
to discuss the fate of a missing Persian Gulf War pilot, instead
sending a note signaling that U.S. officials might agree to meet if
President Saddam Hussein's government promised new information.</LD>
<LD>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld wrote on Monday to Secretary
of State Colin L. Powell, agreeing to the latter's suggestion to turn
down the offer made through the International Committee of the Red
Cross in March and instead ask for fresh information on U.S. Navy
Capt. Michael Scott Speicher.</LD>
<LD>   The Pentagon had listed Speicher as the first American killed in
action in Iraq during the 1991 war after another pilot saw a fireball
in the direction of his plane, but it reclassified him as missing in
action early last year following reports that he was being held
captive. Iraqi officials have long insisted that he died in the crash
of his F/A-18 Hornet.</LD>
<TE>   "We are in touch through various means with the Iraqi government
about the case," Powell told reporters Thursday. "We are anxious to
follow every possible lead with respect to the fate of ... Speicher,
and we are following every possible lead."</TE>
<TE>   Administration policymakers do not believe that the Iraqis are
serious about their offer to discuss Speicher--or any of the
outstanding issues from the war, senior U.S. officials said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has routinely failed to attend meetings of the Tripartite
Committee, formed at the end of the conflict to deal with the issue
of prisoners of war and MIAs. There are still more than 600 Kuwaitis
unaccounted for after disappearing during Iraq's seven-month
occupation of their tiny oil-rich sheikdom, the issue that triggered
the war.</TE>
<TE>   "We've repeatedly given Iraq every opportunity to talk about those
still unaccounted for from other nations, but it refuses to
cooperate," a State Department official said.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the cautious U.S. response is that the Iraqi offer
came with conditions, such as the inclusion in the U.S. team of Scott
Ritter, a former Marine and U.N. weapons inspector who has criticized
U.S. policy in Iraq, said Marine Lt. Col. David Lapan, a Pentagon
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's offer came after the case generated new leads suggesting
that the flier remains alive in captivity. Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.),
on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in February that the leads
indicated Speicher "certainly did survive the crash." He declined to
elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   In a potent symbol of U.S. doubts about Iraqi insistence that
Speicher was killed, he was promoted from lieutenant commander to
commander and then, last week, to captain, moves that would not have
been possible if he were declared dead.</TE>
<TE>   Before the recent reports, some Iraqi emigres told U.S.

<HD>Russia Targets Writer in Porn Investigation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>It is safe to say that this is not a prudish city. Here, erotic
dancing is standard restaurant entertainment. Television networks
broadcast frontal nudity during prime time and soft porn after
midnight. Some teen girls describe prostitution as a glamorous
profession.</LD>
<LD>   So when Moscow's general prosecutor opened a pornography
investigation Thursday against a prominent writer who has won several
literary prizes, many would be forgiven for considering the move at
least inconsistent, perhaps even hypocritical.</LD>
<LD>   "It is a big book, and there are only two bed scenes in it," said
Vladimir Sorokin, author of the offending tome, "Blue Lard."</LD>
<TE>   Sorokin, 46, is a member of Russia's "postmodern" writers
movement. He acknowledges that his 3-year-old book includes foul
language and ribald scenes but insists that its purpose is literary.</TE>
<TE>   "My book is not pornographic," the long-haired, goateed writer
said in a telephone interview. "The goal of pornography is to turn
readers on sexually, whereas my book is a requiem to Russian
literature."</TE>
<TE>   "Blue Lard" is a disjointed, surrealistic fantasy laden with
obscene language and literary allusions. Political and literary
figures from various epochs interact, sometimes carnally. They
include Josef Stalin, Adolf Hitler and revered Russian writers such
as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Anton Chekhov and Anna Akhmatova.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have taken particular umbrage at one scene, in which
Stalin has sex with his eventual successor, Nikita S. Khrushchev. But
fans point out that such episodes come across as comical. They
compare Sorokin's style to James Joyce--a cerebral writer who revels
in vulgarity.</TE>
<TE>   Except no one claims that Sorokin is on a level with Joyce or even
Russia's heretofore most renowned "pornographic" writer, Vladimir
Nabokov.</TE>
<TE>   "Some experts might consider a few of his scenes to be
pornographic, but that alone can't make him a pornographic author,"
said writer and critic Alexander Kabakov. "I believe he is too
cold-headed for that. He writes from his head rather than from his
emotions. In this sense he has a long way to go before he could stand
next to Henry Miller, for example."</TE>
<TE>   The investigation, on charges of "distributing pornography," is
believed to be the first against a writer in the post-Soviet period.
And this being Russia, most everybody assumes that the anti-Sorokin
campaign is part of some kind of conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   Despite President Vladimir V. Putin's new pro-Western foreign
policy, many liberals see this as one more sign that social controls
are increasing at home. They point to the fact that officials from
the former KGB and its main successor agency, the Federal Security
Service, or FSB, are increasingly holding top government jobs. Two
Russian journalists who asked "improper" questions during a Putin
news conference last month have been disciplined, with one fired. An
FSB spokesman was recently appointed to serve as "chief of security"
at the state television network RTR.</TE>
<TE>   "I see this [investigation] as an indication that what these
forces really want is the resurrection of censorship in Russia,"
Sorokin said.</TE>
<TE>   The pornography investigation was begun after weeks of campaigning
by a political youth movement called Marching Together. In the most
publicized event, Marching Together activists threw copies of
Sorokin's books into an enormous toilet bowl outside the Bolshoi
Theater. The activists said they were protesting the Bolshoi's
decision to commission an opera libretto from Sorokin.</TE>
<TE>   "This marks the beginning of the moral recuperation of society,"
said Denis Zaitsev, spokesman for Marching Together. "We consider the
beginning of this process a sign that the era of marginal
writers--who describe in obscene language all possible perversions
and publicly promise to bury our literature--is coming to an end."</TE>
<TE>   Marching Together is strongly pro-Putin--its logo is a portrait of
the president--which raises the question of whether and to what
extent the anti-Sorokin campaign has Kremlin backing.</TE>
<TE>   "No doubt we are dealing with a political case," said Mikhail
Kotomin, deputy director of Ad Marginem, which published Sorokin's
book. "This should be a very good test for the authorities."</TE>
<TE>   For their part, government officials quickly distanced themselves
from the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Literary creation is a very delicate thing," said Culture
Minister Mikhail Y. Shvydkoi. "I wouldn't pose here as an expert. I
am not a fan of Sorokin, but I will protect his right to expression."</TE>
<TE>   Shvydkoi said he believes that the campaign was concocted as a
publicity stunt for Marching Together, a view shared by Kabakov, the
critic.</TE>
<TE>   Whether by accident or design, the anti-Sorokin campaign does
appear to work in Putin's favor: It gives his backers a chance to
stand for traditional values while providing the president an
opportunity to silence critics by defending Sorokin's freedom of
expression.</TE>
<TE>   At least so far, the campaign seems to be a win-win situation for
all involved, even its putative targets: Sorokin, whose name
recognition has skyrocketed, and his publisher, which has seen sales
of "Blue Lard" rise sharply.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks to this scandal, we are having quite a good trade in books
by Sorokin," said Yelena Skudina, who operates a book kiosk near a
central Moscow metro station. "I'm selling at least five 'Blue Lards'
a day, which is very good business by our standards."</TE>

<HD>Archbishop's New Assignment Could Signal His Future as Pope</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>In what was widely seen here as a key move in the politics of papal
succession, the Vatican announced Thursday that Genoa's archbishop,
Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi, has been chosen by Pope John Paul II to
head the influential Milan archdiocese.</LD>
<LD>   "The Vatican is setting up Tettamanzi as a strong candidate," said
Wilton Wynn, a Rome-based expert on papal politics. "He is being put
in what you'd call a pole position for the next conclave."</LD>
<LD>   With about 1,000 parishes, Milan is one of the largest
archdioceses in the world, and many popes have come from there.</LD>
<TE>   After a pope dies or resigns, the College of Cardinals convenes a
conclave to elect the next pope from among its own members, and
Tettamanzi, 68, is now clearly the leading candidate of the powerful
Italian bloc.</TE>
<TE>   "On doctrine and morals he is extremely rigid ... but on a
political level ... he's a critic of globalization," said Sandro
Magister, a Vatican-watcher for L'Espresso, a leading Italian
newsmagazine.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation has mounted in recent months that John Paul, the first
non-Italian to hold the office in 455 years, might retire soon due to
ill health.</TE>
<TE>   The 82-year-old pontiff, who shows symptoms of Parkinson's
disease, and Vatican spokesmen have tried to rule out that
possibility. But on a May trip to Azerbaijan and Bulgaria, the pope's
words were often unintelligibly slurred. The Vatican's announcement
of Tettamanzi's appointment praised him for the "clarity and depth"
of his thought in theological teaching. He is seen by many as a
moderate who could mediate between liberals and conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   Tettamanzi supports John Paul's conservative positions on issues
such as the ban on birth control but is seen as more liberal on
economic issues. Before last year's Group of 8 industrial nations
summit in Genoa, he called on wealthy countries not to forget the
poor. He was seen as sympathetic to the anti-globalization protesters
who gathered in Genoa for the summit.</TE>
<TE>   After the demonstrations turned violent, he drew sharp criticism
from conservative politicians.</TE>
<TE>   The position he took in Genoa might endear him, however, to
cardinals from Africa, Latin America and Asia, many of whom are
concerned about the impact of global economic trends on people in
their nations. A majority of cardinals are either Italian or from
those three continents, so strong support from both blocs would give
a candidate a good chance of being elected.</TE>
<TE>   "Cardinal Tettamanzi has the advantage of being a person who is
very affable, gentle and kind," Magister said. "His characteristics
are much like those of John XXIII--the characteristics of a Good
Shepherd."</TE>
<TE>   Tettamanzi was ordained a priest in 1957 by Cardinal Giovanni
Battista Montini, who went on to become Pope Paul VI. Tettamanzi was
elevated to the rank of cardinal in 1998, and replaces Cardinal Carlo
Maria Martini, 75, a favorite of many liberals, who is retiring as
Milan's archbishop because of age.</TE>
<TE>   Tettamanzi is likely to be a strong candidate for pope until he is
about 72, but John Paul "could quite easily live another five years,"
predicted Father Thomas Reese, editor of America, a New York-based
Jesuit weekly. "Judging by the last papal conclave, it would also
depend very much on whether the Italians were united behind a
candidate. They were not at the last conclave."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Italians would like to have the papacy back, but it's
a different world from the beginning of the 20th century, when the
overwhelming majority of cardinals were Italians," Reese added. In
the current College of Cardinals, about 15% are Italian and 43% are
from Latin America, Africa and Asia, Reese said.</TE>
<TE>   Wynn predicted that Tettamanzi's chances would not be too strong,
largely because he has little experience abroad and does not have the
foreign language skills of many seen as papal candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a highly regarded person, a brilliant man, a great
scholar," Wynn said. "But he lacks the international dimension that a
pope must have.... But being in Milan, his chances are much better
than they were when he was in Genoa."</TE>

<HD>Turkish Foreign Minister Joins Tide of Resignations</HD>
<DH>Government: Ismail Cem's departure follows that of six
other Cabinet officials, further crippling an already weak ruling
coalition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMBERIN ZAMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>ISTANBUL, Turkey</DL>
<LD>The government of ailing Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit was shaken anew
Thursday as Turkey's popular foreign minister announced his
resignation.</LD>
<LD>   Foreign Minister Ismail Cem's defection dealt the most crippling
blow yet to the crumbling three-party coalition government, which has
seen six other Cabinet ministers quit this week.</LD>
<LD>   More than 30 lawmakers also have left the 77-year-old Ecevit's
Party of the Democratic Left in protest over his insistence on
clinging to power despite the illnesses that have kept him away from
office for the last two months.</LD>
<TE>   Hours after Cem confirmed that he was leaving office, Economy
Minister Kemal Dervis also announced that he was stepping down. But
Dervis withdrew his resignation a short time later.</TE>
<TE>   Turkish officials and lawmakers said he changed his mind after
President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, reportedly acting under pressure from
the Bush administration, refused to accept the resignation, saying
the departure would send financial markets, already spooked by weeks
of uncertainty, into further disarray.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the U.S. intervention, according to a senior
Turkish official who asked not to be identified, was fear that
turmoil in Turkey would have a negative impact on other teetering
emerging market economies, such as Argentina and Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey's political crisis is threatening to unravel an economic
recovery program financed by the International Monetary Fund, or IMF.
The stalemate has also stalled democratic reforms being sought by the
European Union before it begins talks with Turkey, which is seeking
to become a member. And it remains unclear whether Dervis' retraction
will suffice to keep Turkey's awkward coalition of right- and
left-wing parties in power.</TE>
<TE>   Romano Prodi, the president of the European Commission in
Brussels, said Thursday that he was postponing a two-day official
visit to Turkey that had been scheduled for next week. The EU said in
a statement that the decision had been made in consultation with the
Turkish authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Cem was counted among Turkey's longest-serving and most able
foreign ministers. He is believed to be acting together with
Husamettin Ozkan, a former deputy prime minister from Ecevit's party,
who sparked the rebellion when he announced his resignation Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Western diplomats expressed hope that, if Ecevit falls, the pair
can muster sufficient support from parliament to form a reformist
government that could see the country through to the next elections.
If Dervis should join this new "dream team"--as one EU diplomat who
declined to be identified described Cem and Ozkan--Turkey probably
would be assured of the IMF's continued support.</TE>
<TE>   The IMF became Turkey's largest creditor after the
Washington-based lending agency pledged about $17 billion in loans
last year in exchange for economic reforms that are meant to end
rampant corruption and streamline a debt-laden banking sector.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the pressure on Ecevit, Devlet Bahceli, the leader of
the ultranationalist wing of Ecevit's coalition, began gathering
signatures from lawmakers this week to convene a session of the
550-member Grand National Assembly to vote on whether to hold
elections as early as November.</TE>
<TE>   Bahceli is widely accused of blocking efforts to abolish the death
penalty and to lift existing bans on broadcasting and education in
the Kurdish language, steps sought by the EU. He commands the largest
number of seats in parliament following the defections from Ecevit's
party.</TE>
<TE>   Should Ecevit's government collapse, Sezer probably would follow
precedent and ask the leader of the party with the greatest number of
seats in parliament to form a new government.</TE>
<TE>   "If the nationalists succeed in forming the government, this would
strengthen the hand of the anti-EU lobby," said Hasim Hasimi, an
ethnic Kurdish lawmaker and member of Ecevit's coalition. "I rather
hope they fail."</TE>

<LD>State lawmakers approved a bill to bring Colorado law in line with a
U.S. Supreme Court ruling by letting juries, rather than judges,
decide whether a convicted killer should live or die.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Bill Owens is expected to sign the measure by the end of
week.</LD>
<LD>   "If we're going to have a death penalty ... we need to make sure
the death penalty is reserved for the worst of the worst, and that's
a decision for the jury," said Democratic Sen. Ken Gordon.</LD>
<TE>   Owens called a special legislative session after the Supreme Court
ruled last month that only juries can hand down a death sentence.</TE>

<LD>Dozens of New Bedford students were told to undergo AIDS and
hepatitis tests after their teacher had them share a needle to draw
blood during science class, said a school official.</LD>
<LD>   The needle-sharing occurred more than a year ago, when a junior
high school science teacher asked for volunteers from his
seventh-grade class to draw blood for a microscope slide.</LD>
<LD>   School officials did not learn about the incident until last month
when one of the students spoke up after watching a video that warned
of the risk of sharing drug needles.</LD>
<TE>   School officials contacted the teacher, who had retired in June
2001. The teacher recalled that 20 to 25 of the 97 seventh-graders he
taught that year participated in the experiment.</TE>

<LD>A bipartisan bill to provide health coverage for disabled children
easily passed a Senate panel.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal, passed by a voice vote in the Senate Finance
Committee, would allow families with disabled children to buy into
Medicaid while continuing to work. Medicaid is a state-federal health
insurance plan for the poor.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of facing a Medicaid cutoff when income reaches about
$18,000 for a family of four, the family could earn $45,250 a year
and still be able to get Medicaid, with payments on a sliding scale,
backers said.</LD>
<TE>   The plan must still go to the full Senate, but it has broad

<HD>Bush Stumps for 'Updated and Modern' Medicare</HD>
<DH>Politics: In Minnesota, the president touts need for a
seniors' drug plan, GOP-controlled Senate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Thursday pressed Congress to quickly approve a
Republican plan to provide limited coverage of prescription drug
costs for older Americans, as the Senate prepares to debate next week
an expansion of Medicare to help patients pay for such drugs.</LD>
<LD>   Opposing the Senate bill, Bush favors a House-approved measure
that would offer Medicare beneficiaries a prescription drug benefit
while relying mainly on private insurers to administer the plan.</LD>
<LD>   Bush also used his visit here to encourage the state's voters to
help return the Senate to GOP leadership. At a fund-raiser, he urged
his audience to work to defeat incumbent Sen. Paul Wellstone, a
Democrat, and replace him with Republican Norm Coleman, the former
mayor of St. Paul.</LD>
<TE>   It was the second time in four months that Bush has visited
Minnesota to help Coleman in the hotly contested Senate race. Bush's
visit helped raise $1 million for Coleman and John Kline, a GOP
congressional candidate.</TE>
<TE>   The one-day trip halfway across the country took the president out
of the nation's capital as more attention was focused on not just the
corporate accounting scandals that have roiled the U.S. stock
markets, but on the president's own past as a business executive.</TE>
<TE>   Part of that attention concerns two low-interest loans he received
in the late 1980s to buy stock from Harken Energy Corp., where he
served as a director. The loans totaled $180,375.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech Tuesday on Wall Street in which he outlined efforts
to stem corporate corruption, he urged an end to such transactions.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Scott McClellan rejected suggestions of
hypocrisy on Bush's part. He said the loans to Bush were "completely
appropriate and fully disclosed."</TE>
<TE>   "I think, even more importantly," McClellan added, "the very
definition of reform as something that is legal has now been abused,
and it needs to be reformed to prevent those abuses from ever
happening again."</TE>
<TE>   Bush made no public reference Thursday to the loans, using the
speech he delivered before attending the fund-raiser to focus on the
prescription drug issue--and to join the pharmaceutical industry's
objections to any government effort to control drug prices.</TE>
<TE>   "Medicare does not cover most prescription drugs. That's reality,"
Bush said to an audience of health-care workers, students and others.
"Too many of our seniors are forced to choose between paying for
their pills or paying basic bills. And that's not right in America."</TE>
<TE>   The cost of prescription drugs looms as a key issue in this year's
congressional campaigns. It is a particularly hot topic in states
with large concentrations of elderly citizens, and even more so in
states along the northern border.</TE>
<TE>   In Minnesota and other states close to Canada, many older people
take buses across the border--occasionally joined by political
candidates riding along to draw attention to the issue--to buy
cheaper prescription medicines.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, as has the drug industry, portrayed efforts by Democrats
such as Wellstone to control drug costs as putting innovation at
risk.</TE>
<TE>   The president devoted much of his speech to recounting the
innovations of U.S. medicine. He said that, as the Senate debates how
to help the elderly pay for prescription drugs, lawmakers should be
careful not to undermine the medical industry's "capacity to be on
the cutting edge of new technologies which save lives."</TE>
<TE>   "We need a Medicare system that is updated and modern to serve the
seniors of today with the medicine of today," Bush said, "and to be
able to serve the seniors of tomorrow--guys like me--with the
medicines of tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   He cited a study released by the Department of Health and Human
Services that says too much regulation could curb seniors citizens'
access to drug breakthroughs.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's argument drew criticism from advocates of more prescription
drug coverage in Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, an advocacy group
for health-care consumers, said the Bush plan backed "the
pharmaceutical lobby's search for greater profits rather than
consumers'--and especially senior citizens'--needs for more
affordable medicines."</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush administration has been lured hook, line, and sinker by
the pharmaceutical lobby's misleading claim that high drug prices are
needed to sustain research and development."</TE>
<TE>   The House passed the GOP-favored prescription drug plan June 28.
It would cost $350 billion over 10 years; a plan offered by Democrats
would have cost $800 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Under the GOP plan, the new drug benefit would be provided not
through Medicare but through subsidies to private insurers that offer
benefits. Beneficiaries would pay premiums of $33 a month and have a
deductible of $250 a year--although those fees would be paid by the
government for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   The program would cover 80% of drug expenses from $250 to $1,000
and 50% up to $2,000. Then there would be a gap in coverage that has
been heavily criticized by Democrats: Beneficiaries would have to pay
all of their expenses until their total costs hit $3,700. At that
point, the government would pick up the whole bill.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), who scheduled debate
on the Democratic measure for next week, has called the House plan
"sham" coverage.</TE>

<HD>Device Would Aid Terrorism Prevention at Ports</HD>
<DH>Security: An electronic padlock will be tested at five
locations. It tracks a container from its country of origin until it
arrives in the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE MUNN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A 6-inch device that costs $15 and is used by the Department of
Defense to seal containers destined for Haiti, Somalia, the Balkans
and war-torn areas may be the key to securing the commercial
containers entering our nation's ports, lawmakers said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Customs officials and ports operators unveiled a system to track
and secure containers from the point of origin to the point of entry.
By the end of September, at least 2,000 containers on routes from
Hong Kong and Singapore to Los Angeles and three other routes will
have tested the device. After packing the container, shippers affix
the mechanism to the container handle. It acts as an electronic
padlock; if a container's contents are tampered with, the device
emits a radio-wave signal indicating where and when the seal was
broken and which container is suspect.</LD>
<LD>   "This new partnership sends a clear message," said Sen. Patty
Murray (D-Wash.), who sponsored legislation to fund the project,
dubbed Operation Safe Commerce. "It tells terrorists that we will
protect our cargo and our ports, and close the gaps that may leave us
vulnerable."</LD>
<TE>   In February 2000, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) warned a
congressional panel that terrorist bombings at U.S. seaports were "a
very real threat."</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the
government is still trying to tighten security at the nation's 361
ports. More than 95% of international goods enter the country through
these ports, making them strategic targets for terrorist activity
that could harm workers and disrupt the nation's livelihood.</TE>
<TE>   The American Assn. of Port Authorities estimates that $2.2 billion
is needed to meet the government's terrorism and crime prevention
security standards for ports. Since Sept. 11, Congress has bolstered
port security funding by $150 million.</TE>
<TE>   An additional $475 million for port security depends on the
passage of a bill in a House-Senate conference committee. As
currently written, most of this funding will pay for Coast Guard
units to meet ships at sea and check passenger and crew manifests
before escorting them into harbor, and for land-based security.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, only 2% of the 6 million containers entering the U.S.
each year are opened and inspected, Coast Guard officials and
lawmakers said.</TE>
<TE>   Two dozen people are involved in moving a container from where it
is loaded to its destination--buyers, sellers, banks, insurance
companies, road and rail companies, the two ports and governments.
This generates more than 30 documents and opportunities for cargo
mix-ups. The port of origin usually does not have the same security
standards as the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "An authorized shipper is not held accountable to know exactly
what is in a container, where it is in the supply chain and to report
on its contents," warned Adm. Richard M. Larrabee, a director of the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, at a recent hearing on
homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   "Shipping papers do not have to be complete and accurate until
after the cargo arrives in the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   To counteract this, "Operation Safe Commerce" trucks will unload
containers overseas at a secure point, and each will be fixed with a
metal-and-plastic seal. The container will then be moved to a lot
where it would be continually monitored and screened before being
loaded onto a ship.</TE>
<TE>   Should someone tamper with the seal at any point during the
shipment, radio-frequency identification technology would alert
federal authorities, who would then X-ray and take additional safety
precautions once the container reaches the ports of Los Angeles-Long
Beach, Seattle, Houston or New York-New Jersey--the five locations
participating in the pilot program.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles-Long Beach port complex is the nation's busiest,
handling more than 2.5 million incoming containers each year. Any
interruption would thwart trade worth more than $150 billion and
endanger its employees, who account for 1 out of every 24 workers in
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that there is a lot of merit in tracking containers
from their point of origin to their final destination," said Los
Angeles Port Police Chief Noel Cunningham.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A panel picked by President Bush to advise him on bioethics declined
Thursday to endorse his call for a ban on human cloning in medical
research, arguing instead for a four-year moratorium aimed at
encouraging more debate.</LD>
<LD>   The recommendation from the President's Council on Bioethics comes
at a politically sensitive time. The House has passed the cloning ban
that Bush favors; in the Senate, opinion is divided. Some senators
believe that cloning should remain a legal tool of disease research.
Neither side has the 60 votes needed to pass legislation.</LD>
<LD>   The bioethics council said that the nation itself is divided about
cloning and that a moratorium would allow time "to seek moral
consensus."</LD>
<TE>   "A national discourse on this subject has not yet taken place in
full," a majority of the panel said in a report released Thursday
after six months of discussion. A moratorium would force both sides
"to make their full case before the public."</TE>
<TE>   The call for a moratorium adds color to what already is an
emotional debate. But it does nothing to break the legislative
impasse, Senate aides on both sides of the issue said.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, no senator has filed legislation to impose a moratorium
on research cloning, as the ethics panel advised. One Senate proposal
would ban cloning for any purpose, while another would ban only
cloning to produce children, allowing research cloning to continue.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the ethics panel itself was sharply divided. Of the 18
members, 10 favored a moratorium; seven said researchers should be
free to use cloning, but under more government regulation. One member
did not vote.</TE>
<TE>   All voting members of the panel recommended a ban on cloning to
produce a child who is a genetic copy of a single adult, a view
shared by Bush and most members of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Leon Kass, the University of Chicago professor who is chairman
of the council, said the group did not try to seek consensus but
instead aimed to lay out various views on cloning as forcefully as
possible.</TE>
<TE>   "The Senate will do what it will, but I hope this report rekindles
an interest in finding a way around the impasse," Kass said,
referring to the logjam in Congress. "A moratorium on all human
cloning so that the debate can continue--I think that would be a
wonderful conclusion."</TE>
<TE>   Kass said that Bush was given a copy of the panel's report
Wednesday night but that he had not talked with the president about
its findings. Bush already has urged the Senate to ban cloning for
any purpose.</TE>
<TE>   Seven members of the panel agreed with Bush that a total ban is
needed, while seven others supported going ahead with research
immediately. Taking a middle course were three who urged a four-year
moratorium. The supporters of a total ban joined them to make a
majority, saying a moratorium would give them time "to make our case
in a more democratic way."</TE>
<TE>   In cloning, a cell from one person is fused with an egg cell to
produce an embryo, which is a genetic copy of the original cell
donor.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have said that studying cloned embryos and the cells
within them may reveal the basic mechanisms of cell function and
possibly give clues to how disease develops. They also envision using
the technique to produce stem cells, which in turn might be fashioned
into cells and tissues for transplant to patients.</TE>
<TE>   In a section laying out the case for this type of research, the
panel report said it "may offer uniquely useful ways of investigating
and possibly treating many chronic, debilitating diseases and
disabilities, providing aid and relief to millions."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say that stem cell research is immoral because it starts
with the destruction of a human embryo and that cloning is a step
toward creating humans with genetically enhanced traits. Others worry
that women will be exploited as companies create a market for the
eggs needed in cloning.</TE>
<TE>   "We find it disquieting, even somewhat ignoble, to treat what are
in fact seeds of the next generation as mere raw material for
satisfying the needs of our own," the report said in a section making
the case to ban research cloning.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional aides said the report was welcomed. But Erik
Hotmire, spokesman for Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.), lead sponsor of a
bill to ban human cloning for any purpose, said it did not change the
state of play in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   A patient advocacy group, the Coalition for the Advancement of
Medical Research, said it would present the ethics panel today with a
petition against a moratorium or ban on research cloning.</TE>
<TE>   The group said it had gathered signatures from 2,000 teachers and
scientists in medical schools and university science departments
across the country, including eight Nobel laureates and people from
all 50 states.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In a state crackdown on people selling fake identification documents,
more than 200 people have been arrested since February, many of them
on New York City streets, authorities said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. George Pataki's Fraudulent Identification Task Force shut
down six fake ID mills and seized more than 2,000 forged documents,
the governor said.</LD>
<LD>   The coalition of local, state and federal agencies was created to
target the manufacture, sale and distribution of illegal passports,
driver licenses and other IDs.</LD>
<TE>   Of the 225 people who have been arrested since the group began
operating in February, more than 140 have been convicted.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot, in this new era where we have people who are out there
trying to actively harm us, [allow] ... false identification or two
identities," Pataki said.</TE>

<HD>Land Freed Up for Emergency Grazing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Agriculture Department released millions of acres across 18
states Thursday for emergency haying and grazing in the drought-baked
West.</LD>
<LD>   Farmers and ranchers face a shortage of forage for livestock in
the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains because of a drought that
dates back several years. The newly opened land, in some counties, is
the only pasture that is still suitable for grazing or haying.</LD>
<LD>   Members of Congress have been pressing the administration for
months to help livestock producers in states such as Montana,
Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota and Colorado. Democrats and some
Republicans have sought direct aid, as much as $4 billion, saying
only rainfall or cash can save ranchers who have been forced to sell
off their herds.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, the administration has been opening lands held in the
Conservation Reserve Program, which pays farmers to put private land
off-limits to grazing or other farming. Before Thursday, the decision
to open the CRP land to haying and grazing had been made on a
county-by-county basis.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's action was sweeping, with Agriculture Secretary Ann M.
Veneman announcing that she is opening all the CRP land in 18 states,
including non-drought counties, for feeding livestock. It adds up to
millions of acres; South Dakota alone has 1.5 million acres in the
conservation program.</TE>
<TE>   "This approval provides immediate relief," Veneman said.</TE>
<TE>   The states are Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas,
Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, North
Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia
and Wyoming.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic lawmakers, particularly senators from Plains states,
welcomed the measure but still criticized the administration, saying
it was slow to respond to the drought crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to help. This is going to make a big difference,"
said Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.). "It should have happened last week."</TE>

<HD>Handyman Charged in Theft From Kidnapped Girl's Home</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Man who is under suspicion in the
disappearance of Elizabeth Smart took jewelry and perfume in 2001,
authorities say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Prosecutors brought theft and burglary charges Thursday against a
handyman who once worked at the home of kidnapped Utah teenager
Elizabeth A. Smart.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Albert Ricci, 48, who police say has a long criminal
history, was charged with stealing jewelry and a perfume bottle from
the million-dollar Salt Lake City home.</LD>
<LD>   Ricci, who has already been convicted of two felonies, was also
charged with being a "habitual criminal." If convicted on all counts,
he could be sentenced to life in prison.</LD>
<TE>   Thursday's charges are unrelated to 14-year-old Elizabeth's June 5
abduction, and Salt Lake City Police Chief Rick Dinse said the
handyman, who has not been charged in that case but has been
identified as a possible suspect, is not "the sole focus of the
investigation" into her disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   Despite searches mounted by hundreds of volunteers and an active
campaign by the family to keep the girl's name in the news, police
have found no clues to Smart's whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   "We have made some progress. It is slow," Dinse told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Ricci, who has denied any involvement in the girl's disappearance,
did some odd jobs at the Smart home and was taken into custody on an
unrelated parole violation on June 14 after police became suspicious
about his alibi for the time the girl was kidnapped.</TE>
<TE>   Ricci's attorney, David Smith, said the charges were the result of
his client's cooperation with police. "I think they're trying to
bring as much pressure to bear on him as possible," he said.</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents Ricci allegedly stole the items "on
or about June 6, 2001," nearly a year before the girl's kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth's father, Ed Smart, confronted Ricci about the missing
items last year and fired him, even though Ricci denied stealing.</TE>
<TE>   Ricci has subsequently admitted stealing items from the Smart
home, the documents said. Police would not say if anything taken
belonged to Elizabeth.</TE>

<HD>Inquiry Opens Into Beating by 2 Okla. Officers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>OKLAHOMA CITY</DL>
<LD>Two white Oklahoma City police officers are under investigation after
a videotape showed them using batons, pepper spray and physical
beating to subdue a black suspect lying on the ground, authorities
said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The officers are seen repeatedly hitting the suspect with batons
as he apparently tried to avoid being handcuffed after being
apprehended Monday for allegedly having sex with a prostitute in a
van.</LD>
<LD>   The Oklahoma case came amid furor in California over another
incident in which a white police officer was videotaped beating a
black teenager after a traffic stop.</LD>
<TE>   Oklahoma police contend that the officers employed necessary force
to subdue a suspect resisting arrest who was much larger than either
of the police officers on the scene.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest was filmed by Brian Bates, a self-described "video
vigilante" who films men soliciting prostitutes and calls police to
have them arrested.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a use-of-force incident. We haven't had any formal
complaint against the officers," said police spokeswoman Capt.
Jessica Cummins.</TE>
<TE>   "While he was not actively aggressive with the officers, he was
actively noncomplying," Cummins said.</TE>
<TE>   The two officers, Greg Driskill and E.J. Dyer, will remain on duty
pending the official review.</TE>

<HD>Freed Pet Fish Take Over Pond, Look Beyond</HD>
<DH>Environment: The voracious snakehead, discarded by an
owner, can clear a body of water, then cross land to new hunting
grounds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>A colony of alien killer fish that have turned up in a Maryland pond
between Baltimore and Washington are the offspring of two discarded
specimens that were raised as pets, state officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The mystery of the ravenous Chinese walking fish all began with a
man's simple wish to make soup for his ailing sister, according to
state investigators.</LD>
<LD>   Two years ago, a Crofton, Md., resident called an Asian fish
market in New York and ordered a couple of live northern snakeheads,
prized in his native Hong Kong for their flavorful and curative
properties. But by the time the fish arrived, the man's sister had
recovered.</LD>
<TE>   With no need to make soup, the man simply plopped the fish into an
aquarium and fed them a couple of goldfish now and then,
investigators with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources said.</TE>
<TE>   The fish began to grow, so he fed them more, as many as 12
goldfish a day. It didn't take long for the snakeheads to wear out
their welcome.</TE>
<TE>   The tree-bordered pond behind the Crofton shopping center seemed
like an ideal new home, the man told investigators. And it was, from
the snakeheads' point of view. They mated and had babies. Lots of
them.</TE>
<TE>   "We could very easily be talking about hundreds, if not more,
juveniles in the pond," said Eric Schwaab, head of Maryland
fisheries, announcing the findings at a news conference in Annapolis
on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The saw-toothed snakeheads are capable of clearing a pond of
bluegill, large-mouthed bass, pickerel and other fish, then hoisting
themselves on to land and limping along on their strong pectoral fins
to new waters. In this case, there's another small pond nearby, as
well as the Little Patuxent River, a tributary of the Chesapeake Bay.
If kept moist, the fish can survive for several days out of the
water.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators solved the mystery after receiving a tip about the
Crofton man, who acknowledged planting the fish. He said he did not
realize that his actions were illegal or could have terrible
consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Police with the resources agency said they could not charge the
Crofton man with releasing a non-native species into the environment
because the two-year statute of limitations had run out. Even if they
could, officials said, the penalty is simply a ticket and a $40 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Department officials did not reveal the man's identity at the news
conference Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The conundrum of what to do about the fish remains.</TE>
<TE>   An angler netted half a dozen baby snakeheads Monday after
spotting them flipping onto lily pads and sucking down insects. And
state biologists brought up six more. Two adults had been caught by
anglers in recent months, alerting the state to the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess they'd eat just about anything," Schwaab said. "It's not
a good situation."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the options include setting off detonating cords
throughout the pond, applying electroshock to it, or poisoning the
pond and collecting all the fish.</TE>
<TE>   Though the fish have been in the pond for more than two years and
have reproduced, there are no indications that they have spread to
any other waterways, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   A panel of policymakers and biologists will be meeting in the next
several weeks to discuss how to handle the situation.</TE>

<HD>Astronomers See Pluto, Jupiter as Top Missions</HD>
<DH>Space: National panel calls on NASA to resurrect its plans
to study the Jupiter moon Europa--and the last unexplored world in
the solar system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A panel of astronomers charged with steering the nation's exploration
of the solar system called on NASA Thursday to resurrect missions to
Pluto and Jupiter's moon Europa--two high-profile projects the space
agency canceled earlier this year for budgetary reasons.</LD>
<LD>   The space agency responded to the National Academy of Sciences
report immediately, boosting hopes for the once-doomed mission to
Pluto--the last unexplored world in our solar system.</LD>
<LD>   "We are already in discussions to see what are the options to
reach Pluto by 2020," said NASA spokesman Don Savage.</LD>
<TE>   The report came as welcome news to Alan Stern, a planetary
scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., and
the lead scientist on the "New Horizons" mission to study Pluto, its
moon Charon and three other objects in the distant Kuiper Belt. Stern
has been through so many ups and downs with the mission, he had taken
to calling his team "the undead."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a major relief," he said. "I'm going to get more sleep
now."</TE>
<TE>   The mission, which was not funded by NASA until Congress stepped
in, still requires $120 million in next year's budget to launch by
2007. That is the last date a Pluto-bound craft could travel the 3
billion miles relatively cheaply by using Jupiter's gravitational
field as a slingshot. It looks as if that money--1% of the NASA
budget--could be forthcoming.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year I fought to put $30 million in NASA's budget to start
the Pluto mission," said Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski, a Democrat from
Maryland who heads the Senate subcommittee that oversees the NASA
budget. "I intend to restore funding again this year, despite NASA's
failure to include money for Pluto."</TE>
<TE>   Louis Friedman, executive director for the Pasadena-based
Planetary Society, has been lobbying vociferously for the space
agency to resume plans to reach Pluto and Europa. A letter-writing
campaign led by the society to support the Pluto mission had been
derided by some as pushing a project that was popular with the public
but of marginal importance to science.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't say that anymore," said Friedman. "The public
interests and the scientific interests are the same."</TE>
<TE>   The panel said that the icy "planetesimals" that fill the Kuiper
Belt are the most primitive material in our solar system--cosmic
fossils that provide a glimpse into our planet's origins.</TE>
<TE>   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration commissioned the
report after a string of mission failures and cost overruns. Agency
leaders asked the panel to list the top scientific priorities for
exploration and pick a handful of specific missions for the next
decade. It was not an easy task.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like taking kids to a candy store--everything is interesting
and delectable. Everyone wants everything at one time. But you have
to prioritize if you want to move forward," said Dimitri A.
Papanastassiou, a Jet Propulsion Laboratory cosmochemist who served
on the panel.</TE>
<TE>   Though NASA officials are struggling to rein in costs, the report
calls for an aggressive approach to space exploration. It suggests
planning now for a series of relatively low-cost missions every 18
months and for "flagship" missions every decade such as Viking,
Voyager, Galileo and Cassini that approach $1 billion in cost but
return vast amounts of scientific data.</TE>
<TE>   "Answers to some of the most profound questions--Are we alone?
Where did we come from? What is our destiny?--may be within our
grasp," said the report, written by a team led by Michael J. S.
Belton, a veteran planetary scientist who heads Tucson-based Belton
Space Exploration Initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   Flagship missions could include a probe to Europa--thought to be a
place hospitable to life because of the vast, liquid oceans that
exist under its icy crust. An earlier mission to Europa being planned
by JPL was canceled after its price tag swelled to $1.4 billion from
$650 million. Much of the extra cost was because of efforts to build
a spacecraft that could operate in the high-radiation environment
around Jupiter.</TE>
<TE>   NASA officials said it would take some time and new ways of
organizing the budget before they could begin funding a Europa
mission.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all so new," NASA's Savage said. "We just have to look at
how we can incorporate it all."</TE>
<TE>   Another expensive mission would be to bring a piece of Mars back
to Earth in an effort to understand how the planet evolved and
whether it ever contained life.</TE>
<TE>   A Mars sample return mission has been under study at the agency.</TE>
<TE>   The panel said the next decade should include a "smart lander"
mission to drill beneath the surface, a network of science stations
around the planet that could take heat flow and atmospheric
measurements for a full Martian year, and planning for a Mars sample
return mission to occur sometime after 2013.</TE>
<TE>   In general, the planetary scientists who would carry out the
missions approved of the new report and priorities, said Mark Sykes,
an associate astronomer at the Steward Observatory in Arizona and
past chair of the American Astronomical Society's Division for
Planetary Sciences. Sykes solicited about 370 scientists to
contribute their views to the process.</TE>

<HD>When Life Imitates a B-Movie</HD>
<DH>Steven Seagal's ex-partner, accused of plotting with mob
figures to extort money from the star, calls their saga a 'magic
carpet ride.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL LIEBERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>When Steven Seagal first surfaced in Hollywood, as a ponytailed
6-foot-4 martial arts expert, he offered a background story full of
murk and menace. He hinted in hushed tones of having done "special
favors" for the CIA. Whether anyone believed him hardly
mattered--what counted was how he put over the tough-guy image in
films that cast him as a lone avenger caught in ominous conspiracies.</LD>
<LD>   Julius R. Nasso showed up in town as a wannabe of a different
sort. He presented himself as the poor immigrant from Brooklyn who
started a pharmaceutical business with $500 saved from a clerk's
job--in a church. Then he set out, like so many others, to make
movies. And for him, it happened.</LD>
<LD>   During a partnership that lasted more than a decade, Seagal
starred in films that grossed hundreds of millions of dollars, and
Nasso helped produce them. They were close, almost like brothers.
Seagal bought the house next to Nasso's mansion on Staten Island and
they often dressed alike, all in black, just in different sizes.
Nasso was a foot shorter than the imposing actor.</LD>
<TE>   Nasso also was the easy one to deal with. Like many performers,
Seagal could be self-centered and moody--"a stubborn, maniacal
idiot," as he once described himself. But it was hard to find anyone
who didn't like Nasso. "I would go in," he said, "and clean up the
mess."</TE>
<TE>   Yet it was worth it, he insisted. Every minute with Seagal.</TE>
<TE>   "I went on the magic carpet ride with him," Nasso explained.</TE>
<TE>   He says that even as the magic carpet threatens to land him in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso is free on $1.5-million bail, preparing his defense against
a federal indictment that depicts him as an associate of the Gambino
crime family, ruled in recent years by John Gotti and his kin. Last
month, prosecutors revealed that a microphone planted to get evidence
of mob influence over New York-area docks had picked up a meeting in
a restaurant between the 49-year-old Nasso and a local Mafia captain.</TE>
<TE>   Their alleged topic of conversation? A scheme to extort hundreds
of thousands of dollars from "an individual in the film industry" who
was not named but whose identity was no secret: the
don't-mess-with-me actor who broke noses and bones on screen.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few snippets of dialogue have been released, but one has
Nasso saying to the mob capo, "Tell me what I have to do and I'll do
it."</TE>
<TE>   It seemed like a plot turn out of the thrillers that earned Seagal
and Nasso their stripes--and another chapter in the long history of
mutual fascination between tough-guy actors and their real-world
counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   Seagal, who is expected to be a key prosecution witness against
Nasso and reputed mob enforcers, is talking only through his
lawyers--who insist he had no knowledge that his partner might have
had such friends.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso, even while denying any wrongdoing, wonders how Seagal could
profess ignorance on that point. Didn't he know the kind of people
Nasso grew up around? Wasn't one of Nasso's brothers married to a
Gambino?</TE>
<TE>   "How could he not know?" Nasso asked.</TE>
<TE>   So Nasso sat down recently to fill in what Hollywood calls the
"back story" to a relationship he uses a film analogy to explain.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like 'Fatal Attraction,' " Nasso said, "without the sex."</TE>
<TE>   Where Did They Meet?</TE>
<TE>   What attracted him first was Hollywood. He noticed right away how
"anyone could walk around and say, 'I'm a producer.' " He sensed that
to become a real player, "you have to do your time." He saw Seagal as
his way to do it.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso has often said he met Seagal in Japan, while on business for
Universal Marine Medical Supplies, his Brooklyn-based company that
sells pharmaceuticals and health gear to cruise lines and merchant
ships. Nasso said he needed a translator and looked up Seagal, who
was fluent in the language: He'd been married to a Japanese woman and
had run a martial arts studio in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso sometimes told people he and Seagal were distant cousins.
They're not, and the whole Japan story is "puffery," Nasso now
acknowledges.</TE>
<TE>   He now says they met in Los Angeles in early 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso had been bitten by the show biz bug seven years earlier,
when Italian director Sergio Leone came to Brooklyn to film the mob
saga "Once Upon a Time in America." Actor Danny Aiello, who was in
it, said that Nasso caught on as a translator and gofer for the
director. Nasso, whose parents emigrated from Italy when he was 3,
spoke Italian and English with equal ease.</TE>
<TE>   After that, when Nasso came to L.A. on business, he would look up
actors from his old Brooklyn neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   One was Jimmy Baio, who had gotten his break in the spoof sitcom
"Soap."</TE>
<TE>   Baio said Nasso was wide-eyed around anyone on TV and in the
movies, and jumped at the chance to attend sitcom tapings.</TE>
<TE>   Baio said he brought Nasso to a party where Seagal was a guest,
and the two hit it off.</TE>
<TE>   In later years, Nasso led friends to believe he "created" the
star-to-be, molding everything from Seagal's squint-eyed stare to his
pulled-back hairstyle.</TE>
<TE>   In reality, Seagal had long-standing Hollywood dreams of his own.
His first wife, Miyako Fujitani, recalls him plotting out script
ideas after they met in 1974, when he was 23. "He developed a story
about a foreigner becoming a dojo master, then went on to the U.S.,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Nasso met him, Seagal had a new Hollywood wife,
actress Kelly LeBrock, and a powerful booster, "superagent" Michael
Ovitz. Ovitz's agency set up a demonstration so Warner Bros.
executives could see Seagal flip aside a parade of attackers. The
result was his screen debut, at 37, in "Above the Law," about a
former CIA operative who discovers nefarious plots in the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Before it hit theaters in 1988, Seagal was profiled in a Times
piece that cast a skeptical eye on his vague stories of having a "CIA
godfather" in Japan. But it also found the gun-enthusiast actor a
plausible rival to such reigning action kings as Arnold
Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone, and he was: "Above the Law"
brought in 2 1/2 times its $7.5-million budget.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso describes himself as basically an unpaid intern on Seagal's
first movies, learning what he could with one goal: "recognition."</TE>
<TE>   One thing he was able to do for Seagal, friends say, was set up a
dinner with Leone during a promotional trip to Italy. Nasso also
invited the actor to spend time at his waterfront house, "the most
beautiful home in Staten Island," Baio said. One room was filled with
glass-enclosed models of the Titanic and other ships.</TE>
<TE>   "He did want to impress Steven, and it worked," Baio said.</TE>
<TE>   When Seagal decided to form his own production company, it became
Seagal Nasso Productions.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso got his first credit on Seagal's third movie, "Marked for
Death," as an associate producer. He moved up to executive producer
on "Out for Justice," which was filmed in 1990 on his old turf,
Brooklyn.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso was ready for his recognition. A New York public relations
man pitched him as "a Horatio Alger character."</TE>
<TE>   Three newspapers did profiles tracing his rise from humble roots,
one account saying he had two doctorates, apparently not realizing
that Nasso proudly counts a 1979 testimonial dinner at Fordham
University as the equivalent of an honorary degree and bases his
other on a membership certificate from the Connecticut Pharmaceutical
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Another profile mentioned that his early jobs included pouring
concrete for an "influential uncle," with no mention of how the elder
Nasso's name had come up at a 1980s mob trial. According to
testimony, the uncle attended a meeting with the then-head of the
Gambino crime family to discuss the contract to pour concrete for the
Jacob Javits Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when Spy magazine questioned such ties, Seagal filed a
suit--eventually dropped--claiming false and defamatory statements,
one being that he was "friends with individuals who have ties to the
'Mafia.' "</TE>
<TE>   If Seagal wanted to distance himself from such associations, other
actors have flaunted their hobnobbing, from early screen hoodlum
George Raft, who grew up alongside the real thing in New York, to
James Caan, Sonny Corleone in "The Godfather," who traced his
friendships with mob luminaries to "research" for his films.</TE>
<TE>   "Am I rubbing their elbows or are they rubbing mine?" asked
Salvatore "Bill" Bonanno, the 69-year-old son of the late mob boss
Joe Bonanno, one of many onetime wise guys who have gotten acting
work.</TE>
<TE>   One of his gigs: a bit part in Seagal and Nasso's "Out for
Justice."</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, after Seagal scored his biggest hit with "Under Siege,"
he and Nasso planned a mob-themed picture, "Man of Honor," about the
son of a Mafia kingpin who becomes bodyguard for a beautiful
informant. But their backer, a Saudi prince, stopped funding. In
litigation with the prince, Seagal and Nasso presented themselves as
unsophisticated about the business.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm an artist," Seagal said in a deposition, adding that when the
prince asked to fund the movie, "I said, 'Great. Talk to Jules.' "</TE>
<TE>   View From the Studio</TE>
<TE>   But studio veterans who worked with Nasso viewed him more as a
talent manager--and benefactor--for Seagal than as a typical
producer. Nasso later said he loaned Seagal $3.2 million over the
years.</TE>
<TE>   "Jules was giving him money out of his own pocket. He treated
[Seagal] like he treated his own son," said Aiello, who became
friends with Nasso. If Nasso sensed that Seagal was upset, he would
fly to California "on a moment's notice," Aiello said.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso said he believed he was assisting "the next John Wayne."</TE>
<TE>   But the magic carpet began to turn downward about the time Seagal
made his directing debut in 1994's "On Deadly Ground," in which he
battled a corrupt oil company. While the film opened atop the box
office chart, critics chided Seagal for becoming preachy, giving
himself a 10-minute save-the-environment speech.</TE>
<TE>   Later that year, filming of "Under Siege 2" was marred by clashes
between the star and production personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso said Seagal became depressed on that shoot and started
gaining weight after he was served with divorce papers by LeBrock,
with whom he'd had three children.</TE>
<TE>   In a lawsuit over the eventual breakup of their partnership, Nasso
complained that Seagal soon came under "the active interference of a
Buddhist spiritual advisor known as Mukara [and] a clandestine and
unorthodox Tibetan sect," some of whose adherents camped in tents at
Seagal's Los Angeles home.</TE>
<TE>   Although a lawyer for Seagal called the allegation "absurd," the
actor's religious life drew headlines in 1997, when a well-recognized
Tibetan Buddhist leader named him a "tulku," a reincarnation "of the
[17th century] treasure revealer Chungdrag Dorje."</TE>
<TE>   Seagal heard the jokes. "They think the lamas are taking bribes,"
he said during a Buddhist retreat in Colorado. "Well, lamas don't
have TVs and they don't know what a movie star is ... and they have
said there is no doubt that I am tulku."</TE>
<TE>   That year, Warner Bros. ended its exclusive production deal with
Seagal and Nasso, with a studio executive saying, "This guy has been
on a downhill run."</TE>
<TE>   According to Nasso's subsequent suit, that provided the opening
for him and Seagal to "develop, produce and market" projects on their
own. He said he bought scripts and went overseas to sell $25.3
million in foreign rights to four films, "all of which stated that he
[Seagal] was to be the star."</TE>
<TE>   But only one was made: "Prince of Central Park," with Nasso's
13-year-old son playing an abused child who flees to the park. Harvey
Keitel ended up playing the gnome who befriends him after Seagal
"refused to appear," Nasso complained.</TE>
<TE>   Seagal's lawyers say there was no "enforceable contract" requiring
him to act in those films. New York attorney Martin L. Perschetz said
there also were "solid business reasons" for Seagal to move away from
his partner. Nasso had proved to be "unproductive and unprofessional
... like showing up late on the set" and was "rude and boisterous
toward other people," another Seagal spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Seagal may simply have had better offers.</TE>
<TE>   Although he was nearing 50, getting on for an action hero, Warner
Bros. gave him a comeback shot in "Exit Wounds," with rapper DMX.
Seagal was slimmed down, and without his ponytail, for the filming in
Toronto in August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, Daily Variety ran a short item reporting that Nasso
was "moving away from action pics to softer fare" and forming his own
company in New York. Seagal closed their L.A. office.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors said that's about when the mob began
conspiring to extort "a figure in the motion picture industry."</TE>
<TE>   Conversation Taped</TE>
<TE>   After a team of FBI agents arrived at Nasso's front door with
handcuffs, at 6 a.m. on June 4, attorneys for the producer offered
their own explanation of the charges: retaliation by Seagal.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Nasso had filed his suit seeking $60 million in damages
for the actor's failure to do the four films. "Do you think it's a
coincidence that this happens after that?" asked Nasso's civil
lawyer, Robert J. Hantman.</TE>
<TE>   But federal prosecutors said it was coincidence--almost a fluke,
in fact, that they uncovered the plot against Seagal.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Andrew Genser said a three-year investigation
had targeted mob influence at the waterfront all the way up to the
latest leader of the Gambino crime family, Peter Gotti, brother of
the late "Dapper Don." The indictment named 17 higher-ups, soldiers
and associates of the family, including members of the strong-arm
crew run by Anthony "Sonny" Ciccone, a 67-year-old mob captain who
allegedly called the shots at the dockworkers' union.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents monitored the phones of Ciccone's men and planted three
bugs at tables at Brioso Ristorante in Staten Island, one of which
recorded a man identified as Nasso speaking with the capo last year.</TE>
<TE>   In a summary submitted at a bail hearing in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn, prosecutors said Ciccone plotted to use the mob's muscle
"to pressure the [film figure] to either pay money or include J.
Nasso in the individual's film projects." He also told Nasso to
"demand that the victim pay Ciccone $150,000 for each film the
individual made," the document said.</TE>
<TE>   Genser, the prosecutor, said in court that Ciccone was caught
"admitting on tape that he's been threatening to kill this
individual."</TE>
<TE>   Court papers make no mention of Seagal paying extortion money, but
say Ciccone "on more than one occasion" met with the intended victim.</TE>
<TE>   Seagal told authorities that one such visit was in Toronto, during
the making of "Exit Wounds."</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Nasso, who is charged with conspiracy and attempted
extortion, have not heard the tapes. But they have already floated
another defense: that the actor knew these people on his own.</TE>
<TE>   "Steven Seagal is a mob nut," criminal lawyer Barry Levin said
after Nasso's arrest.</TE>
<TE>   The actor's lawyers angrily accused Nasso's side of trying to
smear the victim in the case.</TE>
<TE>   But they acknowledge that Seagal may have met organized crime
figures while interviewing "various people for authenticity" for the
mob movie he and Nasso worked on.</TE>
<TE>   As to whether Seagal knew of Nasso's alleged underworld
connections, the Seagal camp allows that Nasso at times "acted as if"
he knew mob figures but "no one believed him."</TE>
<TE>   Such talk was dismissed, a Seagal spokesman said, as "people
trying to get attention in Tinseltown."</TE>
<TE>   Friends say they understand how Nasso could wind up at a table
with Sonny Ciccone's crew.</TE>
<TE>   Aiello said it was impossible not to meet "these people" in
certain restaurants around New York. "If they walk over, what would
you say, 'Get away'? "</TE>
<TE>   When Nasso was asked how he wound up at that table, he said, "It's
the neighborhood. I know them 30 years."</TE>
<TE>   His lawyers would not let him talk about the restaurant
conversation or those acquaintances. But Nasso went on for hours
recently about his Hollywood career. Even with what's on the
line--"my freedom, my life"--he was eager to be seen as a legitimate
player in that world.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso has compiled a list of moments: a 1991 lunch at Le Cirque
with Terry Semel, then chief executive of Warner Bros.; accompanying
Donald Trump to the 1993 opening of the studio's store in Manhattan;
going with Seagal to David Letterman's show to promote "On Deadly
Ground." And on it goes.</TE>
<TE>   He produced proclamations praising him for bringing filming to
local streets, one declaring "Julius Nasso Day" on Staten Island. He
reached in his wallet to show his Directors Guild card. "You don't
get one of these," he says, "hanging around a cafe."</TE>
<TE>   He is not the only one in his family embroiled in the criminal
case. His brother Vincent, 43, is accused of paying the mob $400,000
in kickbacks in return for a three-year contract to administer a
union prescription plan.</TE>
<TE>   A second brother in health care, a chiropractor, was not
implicated. He's the one who in 1989 married a daughter of Johnny
Gambino, an imprisoned mob captain.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso says he and Seagal were so close by then, "he escorted my
mother up the aisle .... Steven was the star of the wedding."</TE>
<TE>   Seagal's camp says that he is "still a big star," with two new
films in the can and two more on deck. He also produces soothing
herbal "essential oils," which are sold worldwide, on his Diamond
Lotus Ranch near Mt. Shasta.</TE>
<TE>   As for Nasso, he can't help worrying whether his magic carpet ride
is over--with his pharmaceutical business. Since his arrest, "it's
down 50%," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But Hollywood? "Something like this makes you bigger out there,"
he said, with amazement.</TE>
<TE>   How dare the prosecutor describe him in court as a "self-styled"
producer?</TE>
<TE>   As friend Aiello sees it, the great irony was in what Nasso did
after the split from Seagal.</TE>
<TE>   He made movies.</TE>
<TE>   One, called "One Eyed King," is in the can. Nasso also was a
producer of "Narc," shown at the Sundance Film Festival in January.
That film, starring Ray Liotta, goes into nationwide release this
fall. Tom Cruise signed on as an executive producer.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso wouldn't miss the premiere if his life depended on it.</TE>
<TE>   "Why wouldn't I go?" he asked Thursday. "The film is a Julius R.
Nasso Production."</TE>

<HD>Israel Will Try Key Palestinian</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The Arafat deputy is accused of orchestrating
terrorist attacks against civilians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Striking near the top of the Palestinian hierarchy, Israel announced
Thursday that it would put one of Yasser Arafat's closest and most
popular deputies on trial for allegedly orchestrating terrorist
attacks against Israeli citizens.</LD>
<LD>   The government said Marwan Barghouti, leader of the Palestinian
Authority president's Fatah faction in the West Bank, would stand
trial in civilian court--not before a military tribunal, as is usual
in such proceedings--because of his suspected seniority in a
Fatah-linked militia group and his alleged connection to "many
terrorist acts" in Israel.</LD>
<LD>   However, Justice Ministry spokesman Yaakov Galanti declined to
specify which incidents Barghouti is accused of instigating, saying
details would have to wait.</LD>
<TE>   "The indictment is not ready yet," Galanti said. "We assume that
it will take a few weeks," with the trial to follow soon afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Barghouti has been in jail and under interrogation since an
intensive manhunt by Israeli special forces resulted in his arrest
April 15 in Ramallah, the West Bank city where Arafat's headquarters
are located.</TE>
<TE>   Barghouti, 42, is the most senior Palestinian official to be taken
into custody during Israel's recent offensives in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   A firebrand known for his street-side speeches and public rallies,
he is considered by many to be second only to Arafat in popularity
among Palestinians, especially the young.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli authorities suspect that he is at the center of a web of
dozens of armed attacks, starting with shootings of soldiers and
civilians and leading, eventually, to suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   By trying Barghouti in public and tying him to violent action, the
government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon clearly hopes to implicate
Arafat as well and discredit his leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "Barghouti's office served as a meeting place where terrorists
would come to get details, report their actions or receive arms,"
Brig. Gen. Ilan Katz, a military prosecutor, told Israeli television
Thursday night. "In some cases, Marwan Barghouti knew or should have
known about the perpetration of certain terrorist attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Barghouti reportedly has confessed under questioning to planning
such operations with Arafat's approval. However, his lawyer, Jawad
Boulos, denied that his client has admitted anything.</TE>
<TE>   "Marwan did not confess and did not sign" anything, Boulos said
Thursday. "I challenge Israel to show you or anybody any statement or
document signed by Marwan."</TE>
<TE>   He said prosecutors' evidence will almost certainly rest on the
testimony of others and not that of Barghouti himself, in spite of
his treatment at the hands of Israeli investigators, whom Boulos
accused of depriving his client of sleep and keeping him sitting on a
small plastic chair for hours on end, his hands tied behind his back.</TE>
<TE>   Boulos criticized the Israeli government for taking nearly three
months to decide to prosecute, while Barghouti was held for the most
of the time in solitary confinement.</TE>
<TE>   In protest over Barghouti's detention, Boulos said he would not
cooperate in any trial but would instead concentrate on having the
charges against his client dismissed or challenging the competence of
the court.</TE>
<TE>   Galanti said assembling the case against Barghouti was "very
complicated," a lengthy process of weaving together evidence from a
number of witnesses and linking it to the charismatic Palestinian
official.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Barghouti, four other Palestinians are to stand
trial in open court for allegedly instigating terrorist attacks,
including a suicide bombing in March at a hotel in Netanya that
killed 29 people and wounded more than 70 others.</TE>
<TE>   Two of those four defendants, Galanti said, operated under
Barghouti's direct command as members of the Fatah-related Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigade, in Ramallah and another West Bank city, Nablus.</TE>
<TE>   Because of his prominence and popularity--some observers consider
him a possible successor to Arafat--Barghouti's arrest has stirred up
strong emotions among his followers as well as his enemies.</TE>
<TE>   After the army nabbed him at the home of a fellow Fatah activist,
anger ran so high that at least one Palestinian was killed by a mob
that apparently suspected him of helping Israel capture Barghouti.</TE>
<TE>   A Palestinian legislator warned at the time that putting Barghouti
on trial in an Israeli courtroom would "have dangerous
repercussions." A "Free Marwan Barghouti" Web site has sprung up, and
his pictures have been posted around Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side are right-wing Israeli officials who have
publicly declared their desire to see Barghouti put to death--and not
necessarily after due process.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you interrogating him for?" Effi Eitam, a Cabinet
minister and leader of the hard-line National Religious Party, said
at a public appearance last week, according to the Maariv newspaper.
"Take him to some orchard and give him a bullet in the head."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the allegations against him, Barghouti has long insisted
that he is a political leader only, a man of his people who attended
their funerals and took to the streets with them. He is one of the
few Palestinian leaders to have cultivated a mass following. And
there are some who still regard him as a pragmatist willing to see a
Palestinian state coexist beside Israel.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, he was transferred to a jail in central Jerusalem where
conditions are so squalid that he has launched a hunger strike, his
attorney said. Barghouti shares a tiny, bug-infested cell with four
other detainees, but his complaints have been ignored, Boulos said.</TE>
<TE>   Besides announcing its plans to put Barghouti on trial, Israel
also defended its closure this week of the offices of a respected
Palestinian academic whom many consider to be a leading voice of
moderation in the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The government's decision to shut down the office of Al Quds
University President Sari Nusseibeh drew a rare rebuke from the Bush
administration. The White House on Wednesday called it a "troubling
event" that "does not contribute to the fight against terror."</TE>
<TE>   Nusseibeh, an Oxford-educated philosophy professor and Arafat's
top official in Jerusalem, has publicly urged his compatriots to stop
carrying out suicide bombings and argued that they must give up their
claim to a right of return to lands in Israel once held by
Palestinians--one of the most contentious issues in the collapsed
Mideast peace process.</TE>
<TE>   But Uzi Landau, the Israeli minister for public security, said his
order to search and shut down Nusseibeh's office, which took place
while Nusseibeh was out of the country, was necessary to prevent "the
long arm" of the Palestinian Authority from undermining Israel's
sovereignty over Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said the raid would only alienate an important moderate at
a time when both Israel and the U.S. have stressed the need to find
Palestinian leaders other than Arafat to deal with.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, meanwhile, President Bush on Thursday called
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Abdullah.</TE>
<TE>   The telephone conversations focused on regional developments since
Bush's June 24 speech on the Middle East, in which he called for a
change in Palestinian leadership, and the next steps in the peace
process, according to a National Security Council official.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is scheduled to travel to New
York early next week to meet with officials from the so-called
quartet--the U.S., the United Nations, the European Union and Russia.
The group is overseeing efforts to revive Mideast peace talks.</TE>
<TE>   Powell will also hold talks with the foreign ministers of Egypt
and Jordan on Tuesday in New York and the Saudi foreign minister on
Thursday in Washington, according to the State Department.</TE>

<HD>Daunting Hardships Temper Afghan Returnees' Euphoria</HD>
<DH>Asia: The postwar nation has little to offer in terms of
jobs, shelter or infrastructure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>QARAH BAGH, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Hauling their meager but precious possessions from
Pakistan--including wooden poles stripped from mud huts to be used to
erect new shelters--Afghan refugees are streaming home with high
hopes but almost no way to make a living.</LD>
<LD>   In the last four months, Afghanistan has seen more than 1.2
million refugees return from neighboring countries--one of the
largest and fastest voluntary migrations in history, according to
officials at the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
Half a million more are expected to return by year's end, and 400,000
internally displaced people could go back to their homes by then.</LD>
<LD>   At first the returns seemed an enormous victory, a reflection of
Afghanistan's relative stability,  but now they are looking like a
disaster in the making, according to aid organizations and government
officials.</LD>
<TE>   Little was done to prepare for the influx, and the sheer number of
returnees--almost triple the projections made by U.N. officials in
January--is overwhelming the country, which has little to offer in
the way of shelter, water systems and sanitation.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly half the returnees have stayed in Kabul, the capital; many
feel that they cannot go back to their rural villages because there
is no work and a four-year drought has made farming impossible.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine the impact of 500,000 refugees pouring into a city like
New York. It would come to a standstill, let alone a city in
Afghanistan, one of the poorest and least developed places on Earth,"
said Yusuf Hassan, a spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency. Donors
promised the agency $271 million based on much lower estimates of
refugee returns--and of that amount, there is still a $56-million
shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   "If assistance doesn't come in terms of housing, jobs, it's going
to destabilize the government," Hassan said.</TE>
<TE>   International donors have also failed to meet their commitments to
start rebuilding projects, as promised last winter in Tokyo,
government officials complain.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a catastrophe, a humanitarian catastrophe. The guilt for
this lies with the international community," said Reconstruction
Minister Mohammed Amin Farhang, a professor of economics who recently
returned to Afghanistan from Germany, where he had worked for much of
his professional life.</TE>
<TE>   Donors promised to invest about $1.8 billion in 2002, but so far
the country has received only $300 million, Farhang says. The United
States, Japan and Germany have been the most forthcoming but
nonetheless have delivered less than they pledged.</TE>
<TE>   One reason is a lingering concern by aid organizations and foreign
donors that there is still too little security in the country.
Farhang points out, however, that instability is a local problem
primarily affecting several north-central provinces and a handful of
southern provinces--a far cry from the widespread turbulence that
traumatized the country during most of the last 23 years of war.</TE>
<TE>   If the international community fails to send money quickly, he
fears, the combination of overcrowding, poor sanitation and lack of
jobs will foment instability in the large urban centers, giving
international donors further reason to delay projects.</TE>
<TE>   "The risk is that Kabul becomes bigger every day, and it doesn't
have the capacity to absorb these refugees and that makes the city
unsafe. And then the international community can say, 'Look, the city
is unsafe,' " Farhang said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a direct relation between reconstruction and security;
the more reconstruction, the more security," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly that is true for farmers such as Mohammed Ashraf. His
story in many ways is a typical one, although he comes from one of
the two most devastated areas of the country. In most parts of the
nation, 30% to 50% of the homes have been destroyed, but in two
areas, Shomali, about an hour's drive north of Kabul, and Bamian, in
central Afghanistan, hardly a house was left intact, according to
United Nations officials.</TE>
<TE>   Ashraf lived in Qarah Bagh on the Shomali plain. Three years ago,
when the Taliban came to his village with guns, he and his family
fled, leaving behind beautiful carpets and half a ton of mulberries,
one of their prize crops. They moved to Karachi, Pakistan, and Ashraf
found work digging tunnels for gas pipelines. He was able to save
$120.</TE>
<TE>   "If we are very careful, it will last us until the winter season,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Like most of the returning refugees, Ashraf and his family were
poor when they left, and their lives hardly improved in Pakistan.
More affluent refugees have yet to come back; they seem to be waiting
to see whether the calm will last.</TE>
<TE>   For Ashraf, the return kit provided by the U.N. refugee agency,
which included 660 pounds of wheat, a tarpaulin, a pot and two
blankets, was essential. The family--consisting of two brothers,
their wives and nine children as well as the brothers' mother--has
already eaten the wheat, which was ground into flour for bread. Now
the family members are living on a meager diet of tea, bread made
with flour bought with their savings, bean soup and mulberries
gathered from trees in the Qarah Bagh area.</TE>
<TE>   If they can stay in their home, they will. But without a bare
minimum of food and shelter, the bitter winds that will come in
winter are likely to drive them south.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Hassan, the U.N. refugee official, says Ashraf's family is
lucky compared with the refugees who are coming back now. Because of
the agency's funding shortfall, the organization has had to reduce
wheat allocations from 330 to 220 pounds for a family of six. And
instead of supplies such as blankets and soap, families now receive
only plastic sheeting.</TE>
<TE>   Other aid organizations are in similar straits. CARE
International, which was building water and sewer systems in
Afghanistan as well as housing, had to sharply scale back its
operation. It had reconstructed about 350 irrigation systems for the
Shomali area where Ashraf lives, but it was too late to carry the
little bit of water that came this spring in the midst of the
drought. And a goal of rebuilding 7,500 houses was reduced to 5,500,
largely because of inflation.</TE>
<TE>   The situation is extremely worrisome, says project manager Farid
Safi, an engineer. "When the cold season comes, people without
shelter cannot stay. They get only a tent [from the U.N. refugee
agency]; the children and animals could not survive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If people have no livelihood, no security, they will start
looting. There will be crime because people must get money to feed
their families," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Afghan returnees are trying desperately to make a go of
it. They are using the poles brought from Pakistan, along with wood
from the trees cut by the Taliban to patch the burnt roofs of their
homes. They hammer metal plates once used for serving communal
platters of rice--but which were battered and burned during the
Taliban destruction--into makeshift pot lids, and they use empty
cooking oil tins as canisters for tea, rice and legumes.</TE>
<TE>   Although they are living on a subsistence diet, they work
constantly to rebuild the walls to their gardens to keep out wild
animals and sheep and to repair at least a room or two so that their
families will have shelter for the winter.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone can give us food and shelter for one year, then we
will stand on our own feet," said Abdul Rahman, who lives in a
village not far from Ashraf's, expressing a common theme.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I might end up in one of the refugee graveyards in
Pakistan," said Rahman, who puts his age between 65 and 70. "I am so
happy to be home, to be free. Now, we are hoping that the world is
looking at us and that they will help us."</TE>

<HD>China Trade Poses Security Threat to U.S., Panel Says</HD>
<DH>Asia: A report to Congress calls for increased scrutiny of
corporate activities and stronger penalties for arms control
violations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN IRITANI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The United States is underestimating the threat to its security, jobs
and technological competitiveness caused by exploding trade and
financial relations with China, according to a fact-finding report to
be sent to Congress on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The 209-page document, prepared by the U.S.-China Security Review
Commission, shows skepticism of China's attempts to open to the West
and warns of the dangers posed to the U.S. The 12-member bipartisan
panel of businesspeople and experts was set up by Congress in 2000 to
be a permanent watchdog on relations between the countries after the
bruising battle over extending permanent trade status to China.</LD>
<LD>   The report is the latest congressional effort to define the issues
that have dogged U.S.-China relations for years. It calls for
increased scrutiny of U.S. corporate activities in China to prevent
the erosion of the U.S. industrial base, stronger penalties for
violating arms control agreements and greater protection for
industries such as steel that face stiff competition from China.</LD>
<TE>   The commissioners took particular aim at the potential harm
created by the rapidly deepening economic ties between the two
countries, a move that has special significance for trade-dependent
California. They maintained that China, through its trade and access
to more than $14 billion raised in U.S. capital markets, was able to
modernize its military and expand its influence in Asia at the
expense of the U.S. The report also blamed the rush of multinationals
to China for aggravating the U.S. trade imbalance, which has
ballooned to $87 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of behavior is not trade; this is global manipulation
by companies for their own bottom line," said Richard D'Amato, a
Democratic state lawmaker from Maryland and chairman of the
commission.</TE>
<TE>   Though acknowledging China's dramatic economic achievements, the
commission contended that Communist leaders had made little progress
toward granting Chinese political and religious freedom, protecting
human and labor rights and stopping illegal weapons sales.</TE>
<TE>   The report described the Chinese government as a suspicious and
often hostile force that viewed the U.S. as a "unilateralist"
superpower intent on imposing its values on other nations. Opening
the economy to free-market forces could lead to widespread domestic
upheaval or the creation of a wealthy dictatorship, neither of which
would be good for the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Even before it hit the printing press, the report touched off
controversy in the U.S. business community. Commission member William
Reinsch, the head of the National Foreign Trade Council, a business
lobbying group, refused to support the findings, saying they were a
simplistic effort to blame China for "virtually every economic
problem the U.S. has." His was the only dissenting vote on the
commission, which was heavily weighted toward military experts.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is our bilateral relationship is doomed to be
difficult," Reinsch said in his statement. "We vie for influence in
the region. This is neither unnatural nor unusual and should not be
justification for demonizing China and turning our relationship into
a struggle for good and evil."</TE>
<TE>   Trying to turn Washington's attention to a complex matter such as
China relations could prove to be a challenge, given the distractions
of unfolding corporate scandals, tensions in the Middle East, the war
on terrorism and the November elections, so the fate of the
recommendations is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   U.S.-China relations have warmed in recent months, helped along by
China's entry in the World Trade Organization and the government's
support for the U.S.-led anti-terrorism campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people's security fears in Washington right now are
pretty close to home," said Edward Gresser, a former Clinton
administration trade official now at the Progressive Policy
Institute, a Washington think tank, who was not on the panel. "People
remain well aware of the problems in our relationship and are unsure
of the future direction China will take, but the image of China has
generally improved during the course of this terrorist campaign."</TE>
<TE>   The emotions surrounding U.S.-China relations reflect the
challenges of balancing economic and military interests in a world in
which a free flow of capital, goods and people has blurred the lines
between friend and foe.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of closer economic ties with China say the $121 billion
in two-way trade will lead to warmer political ties and foster a more
democratic, prosperous country capable of buying American airplanes,
wheat and pharmaceuticals. But skeptics worry that the U.S. is
blindly sacrificing manufacturing jobs, technology and military
security in the pursuit of a quick buck.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not claim that all is sweetness and light," said Robert
Kapp, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, a Washington
trade group. "We do not claim there is no potential for conflict
between these two great nations. But we do believe much progress has
been made and the way forward lies in closer engagement and better
communication."</TE>
<TE>   No place has more of a stake in this new chapter of globalization
than California, the portal last year for more than $341 billion in
international trade. A leading entryway for Asian commerce and
immigration for more than a century, California is home to some of
the country's largest China traders and nearly 1 million people of
Chinese descent, many of whom have played a key role in that nation's
economic rise.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of strengthened economic ties with China embraced some
aspects of the report, including its finding that U.S. understanding
of China's worldview and political actions is woefully inadequate and
contributes to misunderstanding and conflict. The report urged
Congress to beef up funding for Chinese language and study programs
and to resume the military-to-military programs disrupted by last
year's EP-3 spy plane incident.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas Lardy, a China expert at the Brookings Institution,
agreed with the commission that the U.S. should carefully monitor
China's adherence to market- opening measures under the WTO. He said
China had a mixed record, moving quickly to lower tariffs and quotas
but proceeding with caution in areas such as developing a new policy
on genetically modified organisms in food imports.</TE>
<TE>   But Lardy said commission recommendations to consider closing U.S.
markets to Chinese imports--such as textiles or steel--would threaten
China's economic stability and hurt U.S. consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a long list of goods we think are competitive and we
should sell more," he said. "We don't want to talk about or face up
to the fact that China is also competitive in some sectors."</TE>
<TE>   In the area of arms control, the commission already has strong
support from its chief backer, Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), who has
been an outspoken critic of China's alleged role in the spread of
weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Though Beijing has signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, it has denied knowledge of illegal
weapons transfers by Chinese companies. In November 2000, China
promised it would stop helping Pakistan and other countries to
develop ballistic missiles, but that export control system has not
yet been implemented, according to the commission.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd already has endorsed one of the commission's recommendations,
which would dramatically expand the penalties the White House can
impose for illegal weapons sales. It would give the president the
authority to sanction offending governments, as well as companies,
for illegal weapons transfers and impose a wide range of economic
penalties, including restrictions on trade and investment and access
to U.S. capital markets.</TE>
<TE>   The commission also urged the U.S. to continue the Tiananmen
Square sanctions denying export licenses for satellite launches in
China until Beijing fully complies with its agreement to draw up and
publish its export control regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Commission Chairman D'Amato said several recommendations already
were being considered by Congress. Those include legislation that
would require an annual report on science and technology transfer to
China and increased funding for the U.S. Customs Service to enforce
an agreement with China aimed at stopping the flow of prison-made
goods to the U.S.</TE>

<HD>Producer's Porn Ties Said to Derail Jackson's Song</HD>
<DH>Music: Sources say the singer's advisors quietly asked Sony
to drop the 9/11 charity single.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Michael Jackson charity single to benefit victims of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks was abandoned by the pop star's advisors after they
discovered that the song's executive producer had ties to the gay
pornography business, according to documents obtained Thursday by The
Times and sources close to the charity effort.</LD>
<LD>   As part of his bitter feud with Sony Music Entertainment Inc.,
Jackson accused Sony of blocking the release of the charity single,
"What More Can I Give," featuring artists from Ricky Martin to Reba
McEntire to Mariah Carey.</LD>
<LD>   The pulling of the single came after McDonald's Corp. backed out
of a multimillion-dollar agreement to sell the single in its
restaurants, said sources involved in the deal. Those sources said
the fast-food chain feared fallout from customers because of
Jackson's involvement in a 1993 child molestation case he settled for
a reported $20 million.</LD>
<TE>   These revelations could call into question his credibility in the
dispute with Sony. Jackson has blamed Sony Music and its chairman,
Thomas D. Mottola, for the poor showing of his "Invincible" album.
Jackson said Sony failed to adequately promote the recording and has
accused Sony and other record companies of conspiring to cheat
artists--particularly black artists--out of royalty payments.</TE>
<TE>   But internal records and interviews indicate that it was Jackson's
own advisors who quietly asked Sony to bury the charity project after
discovering that Jackson had hired F. Marc Schaffel to be the song's
executive producer and that Jackson had signed over the rights to the
single to Schaffel.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's representatives declined to comment Thursday except to
say that when they and Jackson found out about Schaffel's background,
they immediately broke ties with him.</TE>
<TE>   Sony declined to comment, and McDonald's representatives could not
be reached for comment late Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no secret that my background is in the adult film business,"
said Schaffel, who said he has produced and directed dozens of gay
pornography videos.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't keep anything in my life hidden. I'm Michael's friend....
I think this was a just smokescreen threat sent to shut this single
down because of a bigger fight going on. It's a shame because, in the
end, so many people could've been helped."</TE>

<HD>Proposals for L.A. Boroughs Faltering</HD>
<DH>Secession: Competing plans lack City Council backing for
placement on the fall ballot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN and PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prospects that Los Angeles voters will get the chance in November to
decentralize city government by adopting a system of local boroughs
are all but dead, supporters of two such plans said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The apparent demise of the proposals clears the way for a simple
yes-no campaign over Valley and Hollywood secession measures already
on the Nov. 5 ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Competing borough proposals by former Assembly Speaker Bob
Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) and Los Angeles City Council members
Janice Hahn and Wendy Greuel have been promoted as an alternative to
secession.</LD>
<TE>   But with a City Council deadline for placing them on the ballot
just days away, neither proposal has the votes to make it. The
proposals have stalled as city officials have grown more confident
that they can beat the separatists.</TE>
<TE>   "We're off the map, clearly at this point," a Hertzberg spokesman
said Thursday. "I went in to [Hertzberg] today and said, 'The party's
over.' "</TE>
<TE>   Hahn conceded her plan also faces defeat, though Greuel said she
is holding out hope for a last-minute reprieve.</TE>
<TE>   Boroughs had been embraced by some activists and city officials on
both sides of the secession debate as a way to address the
frustration of those who believe Los Angeles government is unwieldy
and unresponsive, without going so far as to break up the city.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an opportunity to have a real civic debate in this city
like we've never had before," Janice Hahn said. "I'm disappointed
that voters won't have something positive to vote on besides keeping
the city together. But it just didn't seem like there were enough
people to take that leap."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn, the councilwoman's brother, said Thursday he
does not favor putting a borough measure on the November ballot. The
mayor previously had not taken a firm position on the idea. He would
have the option of vetoing a council resolution sending a borough
plan to voters.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't think we are ready," he said. "We have not had
public hearings and input. I just don't think we should rush it onto
the ballot."</TE>
<TE>   The council is set to vote on the Hahn-Greuel plan Tuesday.
Members might instead adopt a proposal by council President Alex
Padilla to establish a commission that would examine ways to improve
the structure of city government.</TE>
<TE>   The Hahn-Greuel plan would ask voters to create a commission to
draft a borough system. The commission's final work would go back to
voters in May. The boroughs would have authority over local spending,
land-use decisions and city services.</TE>
<TE>   Hertzberg's proposal is much more specific. It calls directly for
the elimination of the City Council in favor of a board of at least
nine borough presidents. Each borough would be governed by a
five-member council elected locally.</TE>
<TE>   Despite weeks of lobbying, Hertzberg was unable to get significant
support at City Hall for his plan. He also failed to strike a
compromise with Hahn and Greuel that would have incorporated elements
of his proposal into theirs.</TE>
<TE>   The Hahn-Greuel plan picked up six votes on the 15-member council,
according to the two councilwomen. Eight are needed to put it on the
ballot, and 10 would be required to override a mayoral veto.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's grim prognosis for the plans came just a day after two
leaders of the Valley cityhood campaign said they would support a
Hertzberg-style proposal as a secession alternative.</TE>
<TE>   The leaders, Richard Close and David Fleming, made their
statements as a part of a compromise that Hertzberg tried to broker
after getting nowhere with the council. The overture was rejected by
the mayor and Padilla. Several city officials said Thursday they
viewed the secessionists' willingness to consider boroughs as a sign
that the Valley campaign is in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   But Fleming and other secessionists criticized the mayor for
refusing to consider any borough plan and predicted it would
backfire.</TE>
<TE>   "Hahn has done us a favor, there's no question about it," Fleming
said Thursday. "He rejected [the borough plans] out of hand, saying,
'I don't have to listen to you people.' It's a slap in the face."</TE>
<TE>   Fleming and Close also sought to assure allies Thursday that there
was nothing improper about their talking to Hertzberg, businessman
Eli Broad and others about possibly delaying a secession vote for two
years if a borough system was put to the voters that gave the Valley
local control.</TE>
<TE>   Close said his participation in the talks did not weaken his
support for secession. In fact, he said, it has strengthened it.</TE>
<TE>   Despite those reassurances, Gene LaPietra, the leader of the
Hollywood secession movement, criticized Fleming and Close.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe Mr. Close and Mr. Fleming were misguided in their
actions," LaPietra said in a statement. "Boroughs have been
considered and rejected by the City Council, by the mayor and by two
charter commissions. This is the best example of how backroom
politics always fail. The business of the people should always be
conducted in the light of day."</TE>
<TE>   The LaPietra statement marked the first public break between the
Valley and Hollywood secession camps.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, state Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar) offered his own
plan Thursday for remaking City Hall--a six-year program that would
be led by an as-yet unformed state commission. On Wednesday, Alarcon
announced he would not run for mayor of a Valley city and had decided
to oppose secession.</TE>
<TE>   He said Thursday he will introduce legislation that would create a
state commission to revamp Los Angeles government. If approved by the
Legislature, the panel would recommend City Charter changes every two
years to boost the power of neighborhood councils, and would consider
creating a borough system within six years.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon also asked the mayor to more than double the $3 million
allocated to neighborhood councils for local priorities. The mayor
said he would like to increase the councils' budget, but would not
commit to Alarcon's figure.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists dismissed Alarcon's plan as too little, too late.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need another study," said Richard Katz, chairman of the
San Fernando Valley Independence Committee. "People have made it
clear they want to vote on secession. They want more local control."</TE>
<TE>   The secessionists have also criticized the Padilla proposal for a
21-member city commission, which would have a largely undefined
mission of reviewing the shape and performance of city government.
Padilla said he is willing to have the commission consider boroughs,
but only as one of many options for improving City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Janice Hahn said Padilla's plan would be "better than nothing."
She predicted the commission would eventually endorse a borough
system.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the end result is going to be the same," she said. "I
will bet you $100 that Los Angeles will have boroughs. I believe it
with all my heart."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In early 1989, George W. Bush and his fellow board members at Harken
Energy Corp. were presiding over a company that was headed south in a
hurry. The Dallas-based oil firm had lost millions of dollars placing
bad bets on commodity futures. Debt was piling up; red ink was
beginning to flow.</LD>
<LD>   Harken's executives came up with a novel plan to ease the pain.
They would sell a small chain of Hawaiian gas stations called Aloha
Petroleum to a group of investors that included Harken's chairman and
one of its directors. The buyers would pay $1 million up front, but
the accountants would record an immediate $7.9-million profit, enough
to erase most of Harken's losses for the year.</LD>
<LD>   They made a point of seeking the approval of directors who were
not participants in the investor group. Bush, a member of the board's
audit committee, signed off on the deal, according to Harken
documents. So did the company's outside auditor, Arthur Andersen &amp;
Co.</LD>
<TE>   But the government challenged and ultimately overturned the
accounting method used by Harken to post a gain on the sale. Aloha
was sold a second time, and the new buyer extracted big concessions
from the company. The initial profit recorded on the sale morphed
into a big loss. In the midst of all the maneuvering, Bush sold most
of his Harken stock in June 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Based on a review of publicly released Securities and Exchange
Commission filings, meeting minutes, memos and correspondence from
that period, there is no evidence that Bush, or any of the other
directors, raised objections or expressed concern about the Aloha
deal.</TE>
<TE>   Experts on corporate governance say that as an independent
director and one of only three members of the audit committee, Bush
was in a position to exercise an important oversight role but
apparently failed to do so.</TE>
<TE>   An audit committee's primary responsibility is to ensure that the
company's outside auditors conduct a thorough examination of the
financial records without interference from officers and employees.</TE>
<TE>   The White House on Thursday declined to comment on the SEC
documents pertaining to Bush's actions as a director.</TE>
<TE>   As the president tries to respond to the wave of accounting
scandals sweeping corporate America, the events of 12 and 13 years
ago have come back to haunt him.</TE>
<TE>   The Aloha sale was so similar to what Enron Corp. did to hide its
losses that Harken could have served as a model for the now-disgraced
company, one accounting expert said.</TE>
<TE>   "The people at Enron could have gone to school on this thing,"
said Alfred King, former managing director of the Institute of
Management Accountants, vice chairman of Milwaukee-based Valuation
Research Corp. and former advisor to the Financial Accounting
Standards Board.</TE>
<TE>   "They sold to themselves and recorded a profit," King said.
"That's exactly what Enron did on a number of those off-balance-sheet
transactions. On this one transaction at least, it's almost
identical."</TE>
<TE>   Bush rejects the comparison to Enron, a far larger Texas energy
firm that cooked its books on a scale never before seen. He insists
his actions at Harken were thoroughly investigated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "In the corporate world, sometimes things aren't exactly black and
white when it comes to accounting procedures," Bush said when asked
in general about Aloha at a news conference this week.</TE>
<TE>   It's up to the SEC, Bush said, "to determine whether or not the
decision by the auditors was the appropriate decision. And they did
look, and they decided that the earnings ought to be restated, and
the company did so immediately."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's father was vice president in 1986 when Bush's previous
company was purchased by Harken and he became a member of the board.
Bush's sale of his Harken stock in 1990 was an issue in his 1994
gubernatorial campaign and 2000 presidential bid.</TE>
<TE>   But Harken's sale of Aloha received little public attention until
Enron's spectacular collapse and parallels were noted between the
Aloha deal and Enron's practice of inflating its earnings and shoring
up its balance sheet by hiding massive amounts of debt in
partnerships consisting of company insiders.</TE>
<TE>   The magnitude of Enron's collapse is many times greater than
Harken's financial travails. Moreover, Enron's top officers are
facing criminal charges for their actions. Although the SEC required
Harken to revise its financial results for 1989, it did not refer the
case to its enforcement division for prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   "If the division of corporate finance had believed the purpose of
the [Aloha] transaction was to generate a phantom profit, there is
little question that it would have made a referral," said Jacob S.
Frenkel, a former SEC enforcement attorney who heads the white-collar
crime group at the Gambrell &amp; Russell law firm in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Still, accounting experts, security law specialists and political
analysts say there is enough similarity between events at Harken and
Enron to keep Bush on the defensive about his own actions a decade
ago and undermine his credibility as a corporate reformer.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Bush would not have been allowed to serve on Harken's
audit committee if the reform proposals he outlined this week had
been in effect then. The president says audit panel membership should
be limited to outside directors. Besides sitting on Harken's board,
Bush had a consulting contract with the company. According to
accounting experts, that qualifies him as a corporate insider.</TE>
<TE>   "Hiding losses in partnerships, playing games with accounting, not
reporting forthrightly transactions as a potential inside
trader--it's all eerily reminiscent of Enron," said Charles Lewis,
executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington
research group. "This is not a corporate executive who laid awake at
night worrying about complying with federal laws, from all
appearances," said Lewis, who has been critical of the Bush
administration.</TE>
<TE>   Another transaction at Harken would have violated Bush's reform
proposals as well: On Thursday, the White House confirmed that Harken
made two loans to Bush while he served on the board of directors, a
practice that Bush now wants publicly held companies to prohibit.</TE>
<TE>   The loans, totaling $180,375, were made in 1986 and 1988 at a
below-market interest rate to enable Bush to purchase Harken stock
under an incentive plan for board members. They were later converted
into stock options that Bush never exercised, the White House said.</TE>
<TE>   Suspicions about the Aloha Petroleum deal have been fueled by the
fact that most of the principals refuse to talk.</TE>
<TE>   Of the seven Harken directors who served on the board with Bush,
five declined to discuss the deal or did not return calls seeking
comment. Executives at Aloha, now a privately held company, also
declined to comment. So did past and present officials at Harken,
Arthur Andersen and the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Former director Talat M. Othman, who chaired the three-member
audit committee, said he did not recall the details of the Aloha sale
or the company's reasons for arranging it. "I'm not sure that our
motivation was to create instant profits," said Othman, a Palestinian
who represented Saudi investors who owned 13% of Harken's stock. "It
was a normal part of the business to be buying and selling."</TE>
<TE>   The third audit committee member, E. Stuart Watson, also said he
didn't remember much about Aloha. "I don't know about that Hawaiian
outfit because I was getting off the board about that time," Watson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Aloha dispensed gasoline at 40 or so service stations, convenience
stores and mini-marts on Oahu and Hawaii. The little chain traced its
history to J. Paul Getty, who installed the island's first gas pumps.</TE>
<TE>   Harken acquired Aloha in 1986 when it bought a multi-state gas
retailer called E-Z Serve. When it announced its plan to sell 80% of
Aloha in 1989, it said Hawaii was too far away from its other
gasoline markets and required too much management attention.</TE>
<TE>   But the new owners looked an awful lot like the old owners. The
buyers were an investor group controlled by the family of Harken
Chairman Alan G. Quasha. The sales price was $12 million, of which
$11 million would come in the form of a loan from Harken, with no
payments due for several years. Although the company received only $1
million, it recorded a $7.9-million profit on the sale.</TE>
<TE>   Harken reported a net loss of $3.3 million for that year. It was
bad news for shareholders, but it could have been much worse.
Harken's commodity trading losses had reached $16.6 million by year's
end. Without the Aloha profit, the 1989 shortfall would have been a
real shocker.</TE>
<TE>   The Aloha transaction raised eyebrows at the SEC, which spent
several months reviewing the relationship between Harken and the
buyer group and the accounting procedures that produced the big
profit.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the agency forced Harken to restate its earnings for
1989. The $3.3-million loss ballooned to $12.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Aloha had changed hands a second time. Quasha's
investor group sold the chain to a firm headed by David Halbert, a
business associate of Harken President Mikel D. Faulkner and a friend
of Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, it was not a clean break. When Harken sold Aloha to
Quasha's group, it had agreed to retain liability for any
environmental problems associated with the chain.</TE>
<TE>   In early 1990, it discovered that the commitment would cost it
dearly. Aloha's new owner had 20 gas outlets tested and found that 11
had leaky underground tanks requiring expensive repairs. There were
21 sites still awaiting tests.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Harken was experiencing a severe cash flow crisis and
needed to raise money fast. Acknowledging in internal memos that it
was negotiating from weakness, the company agreed to forgive $7.2
million of the money it was owed by Halbert for the Aloha purchase
and related transactions in exchange for accelerated payments of the
remaining debt.</TE>
<TE>   King, the accounting expert, said the initial sale to the insider
group and the subsequent concessions to the second buyer no doubt
contributed to the SEC's conclusion that Harken had no business
booking a profit.</TE>
<TE>   "When it came time to have a third party put up real cash, they
didn't get anywhere near what they were hoping for," he said. "That
suggests they did not have a true sale at the nominal price."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's audit committee colleagues, Othman and Watson, said they
consider it unfair to hold the president responsible for a deal that
was conceived and carried out by Harken's corporate executives.</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of several directors," said Othman, president of Grove
Financial, a Chicago-area investment firm. "Any sale or purchase of
that nature doesn't hinge on one director's responsibility or one
director's opinion. It's the consensus of the board."</TE>
<TE>   Watson said he thinks Democrats in Congress are fanning the flames
of the Aloha controversy in an effort to hurt Bush politically.</TE>
<TE>   "George wasn't running that company," Watson said. "And by golly,
I was with him for about four years on the board, and I liked him. I
thought he was a straight shooter then, and I still think so."</TE>

<HD>Bishops Challenged on Policy for Priest Removal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 50 of the nation's 46,000 Roman Catholic priests have
resigned from the priesthood or been permanently removed from the
ministry under a policy on sexual abuse adopted by Catholic bishops a
month ago.</LD>
<LD>   As a result of the policy--intended to keep priests who molest
children away from parishioners--those men may no longer wear the
Roman Catholic collar, celebrate Mass with parishioners or represent
the church in any public fashion. Their removals are in addition to
at least 250 priests removed from duty earlier this year before
bishops approved the new policy on June 14 in Dallas.</LD>
<LD>   The removals are the most visible sign of the immediate effect of
the new policy, which bishops adopted under public pressure after
months of revelations about how priests were kept in their jobs or
transferred to other dioceses despite warnings of sexual abuse.</LD>
<TE>   Some of America's bishops have been struggling to implement the
policy. A few priests removed from public ministry under the plan
have appealed to the Vatican for reinstatement--and some
rank-and-file Catholics have supported them. Several bishops have
also delayed ousting errant clergy until they thoroughly review key
parts of the policy, such as its broad definition of sexual abuse.
Public pressure is mounting in new quarters as grand juries in
several cities have begun their own investigations of priestly abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The new guidelines "raise some real questions about compatibility
with our traditions," said the Rev. Thomas Green, an expert on church
law at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the clergy removed in the last months held positions
ranging from hospital chaplains to administrators of marriage
tribunals and diocesan cemetery departments--posts in which they had
no contact with children. Some had already retired, but several were
leading churches.</TE>
<TE>   Some priests have challenged their punishments. Five in the
Chicago Archdiocese have asked the Vatican to return them to public
duty, and Cardinal Francis George has asked the Holy See for guidance
on how to respond.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Robert Silva, head of the National Federation of Priests'
Councils, which claims about half of U.S. priests as members, said he
is starting to collect information about appeals in other dioceses.
But he said many priests have expressed concern that the policy
ignores their due process rights under church law.</TE>
<TE>   Silva was particularly angered by arguments from some Catholics
that priests with a history of misconduct have a moral obligation to
step down.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not to take the high road simply to acquiesce," Silva said.
"Everyone has a right to appeal."</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which is
handling the U.S. appeals, has not commented on the cases.</TE>
<TE>   In the Diocese of Toledo, some Ohio parishioners at St. Michael
the Archangel Church were upset when Bishop James Hoffman removed the
Rev. Robert Fisher, who was convicted in 1988 of sexually abusing a
14-year-old girl. Fisher spent 30 days in jail and has undergone four
years of counseling; parishioners knew of his misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Thomas Quinn, the diocese spokesman, said there were
concerns that Fisher and other rehabilitated priests like him were
being punished twice.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Wilton Gregory, president of the U.S. Conference of
Catholic Bishops, traveled to Rome last month to deliver the bishops'
policy to Vatican officials--a first step toward seeking their
approval. He has said he is confident the Holy See will authorize the
document, which is necessary to make it binding on all dioceses in
the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, some bishops said they will hold off on parts of the
plan.</TE>

<HD>Global Warming Plan Is Announced</HD>
<DH>Environment: The White House approach 'guards against
costly and misdirected policy errors,' spokesman says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In defending their approach to global warming, President Bush's
advisors said Thursday that costly near-term measures to reduce
emissions aren't justified, but they will develop a 10-year research
plan to better understand climate change.</LD>
<LD>   The White House promises to publish the plan, which was mandated
in 1990 but never done, in March. Administration officials also said
scientists' ability to create models for forecasting climate change
still is not precise enough for the United States to agree to
international emission cuts.</LD>
<LD>   James L. Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council of
Environmental Quality, told senators that withdrawing from an
international climate treaty with mandatory controls for industry
will preserve billions of dollars and millions of jobs.</LD>
<TE>   "The Kyoto Protocol would have cost our economy up to $400 billion
and caused the loss of up to 4.9 million jobs, risking the welfare of
the American people and American workers," Connaughton said. He
repeated Bush's complaint that developing countries expected to grow
rapidly also must participate for any such treaty to be effective.</TE>
<TE>   Connaughton acknowledged that "greenhouse gases will increase
under our approach, no question about it," but said the president's
approach is based on the current level of scientific certainty and
"guards against costly and misdirected policy errors."</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), who presided over the Commerce
Committee hearing, insisted that the predictions of economic gloom
and doom were overstated. He said the Bush administration's own "dire
warnings" of global warming's likely effects--contained in its report
to the United Nations last month--justify more than a voluntary
approach.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an inconsistency," Kerry told the advisors. Even as the
administration acknowledges potentially "grave consequences" of
global warming, he said, "emissions will increase each year under the
president's program."</TE>
<TE>   "Why should Americans be satisfied that this is a legitimate
response to this crisis, this problem we face?"</TE>
<TE>   The National Wildlife Federation said Thursday that its analysis
of Energy Department data from the last five years shows the nation's
carbon dioxide emissions from energy sources over the next 10 years
likely will grow by 9.5%, but under Bush's global warming plan that
rate probably will increase 13%, assuming the level of economic
growth predicted by the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry and other Democrats on the panel, such as Sen. Barbara Boxer
of California, who cited the environmental group's report, said they
favor setting goals for long-term mandatory cuts in emissions of
heat-trapping gases. Those gases, particularly carbon dioxide, come
from various sources, including the burning of oil and coal, and are
blamed by many scientists for contributing to a "greenhouse," or
warming, effect on global climates.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's plan calls for voluntary action by industry, contrary to
the 1997 treaty negotiated in Kyoto, Japan, that mandates reduction
of those gases by industrial nations.</TE>

<HD>Senate Panel Approves Reforms for Corporations</HD>
<DH>Finance: Stalled bill gains new urgency. It includes limits
on loans to executives and guards on retirement funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>With an eye on the falling stock market, a key Senate committee
joined the bipartisan rush to corporate reform Thursday, approving
new restrictions on company loans to executives and protections for
workers' retirement savings.</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous vote by the Senate Finance Committee for a bill that
had been stalled for months was a further sign of the support for
speedy congressional action to restore investor confidence in
financial markets shaken by scandals at Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc.
and other companies.</LD>
<LD>   The committee action came as the full Senate pressed ahead on a
measure that would strengthen federal oversight of the accounting
industry.</LD>
<TE>   ''We need to get this bill done as quickly as possible,'' said
Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), who is usually wary of more business
regulation. ''The stock market is dropping.''</TE>
<TE>   The accounting reform bill is likely to be approved early next
week, and Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said he would
not be surprised if it passes by a unanimous vote.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill then would have to be reconciled with a
House-passed measure that critics have labeled as too weak.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, a GOP leader on financial issues who
usually opposes increased federal regulation, said, ''We have the
makings of a good bill that can be broadly supported.... The sooner
we put together a bill that will represent a compromise, the more
certainty there will be on Wall Street.''</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, House and Senate lawmakers are anxious to begin
negotiations and get a bill to President Bush--fast.</TE>
<TE>   Suggesting the chambers are not that far apart, House Speaker J.
Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) endorsed the tougher criminal penalties for
corporate fraud put into the Senate bill on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Both the House and Senate bills would set up an accounting
oversight board, but Senate Democrats say the House measure would
create a weaker board.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) unsuccessfully pushed for an even
tougher Senate version of the bill Thursday. He assailed Senate
Democratic leaders for blocking a vote on his amendment that would
force companies to deduct the value of stock options from their
income, an action opposed by the high-tech industry, which has long
used options as a form of compensation.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill, sponsored by Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), grew
out of the financial collapse of Enron late last year, as did the
measure approved by the Senate Finance Committee. Both bills
sputtered as the furor over Enron subsided, then gained new momentum
after the recent revelation of WorldCom's nearly $4-billion
accounting scandal.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, some Republicans on the finance panel pushed for
reforms as aggressively as did Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   With 5,000 Enron and WorldCom employees in his home state, Sen.
Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said, ''I believe I speak for all of
them when I say I'm firefighting mad about company executives and
directors who play fast and loose with the retirement money of
hard-working employees.''</TE>
<TE>   The bill approved by the panel would give employees new rights to
sell company stock and diversify investments in their 401(k)
retirement accounts.</TE>
<TE>   It also would crack down on loans made by companies to their
executives, a practice that has drawn scrutiny after revelations that
insiders at Enron, WorldCom and other scandal-plagued companies
received such loans, even while their firms were in financial tumult.</TE>
<TE>   Bush wants to ban such loans. But the White House found itself on
the defensive Thursday over $180,375 in low-interest loans that Bush
received in the late 1980s from a Texas oil company while serving on
its board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   The committee bill would treat corporate loans in excess of $1
million to insiders as compensation, subject to taxation. The measure
also would set minimum interests rates for such loans.</TE>
<TE>   The pension reforms in the bill are in response to the huge losses
suffered by Enron employees when the value of company stock, which
made up much of their retirement savings, plummeted as the company
descended into bankruptcy last year.</TE>
<TE>   The finance panel measure also would allow workers to sell company
stock after three years of service. A pension reform bill approved by
the House earlier this year would allow employees to sell the stock
three years after it was acquired.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, companies can impose much stricter limits. Enron
required workers to hold company stock in their retirement accounts
until age 50.</TE>
<TE>   The finance panel measure also would require investment advisors
to employees to be independent of firms that manage their retirement
plans.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill would permit advisors to steer employees to
investments in which they have a financial stake as long as they
disclose that stake.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), chairman of the finance committee, said
the bill ''strikes the right balance. It prevents companies from
keeping workers locked into company stock in their retirement plans.
At the same time, it allows workers to keep investing in company
stock if they decide that's best for them.''</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats must work out differences among themselves before
they take up a pension reform bill, expected in September. Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) is seeking stricter limits on firms' use
of company stock to contribute to 401(k) accounts and seats for
employees on pension boards.</TE>

<HD>House Committee Balks at Bush's Security Plan</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Panel votes to block putting the Coast Guard,
FEMA into a department for homeland defense. Battle over turf is
likely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Spurning the White House blueprint for homeland security, a key House
committee voted Thursday to block the transfer of the Coast Guard and
the Federal Emergency Management Agency to the huge new government
department envisioned by President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   The action by the House Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee portends a bruising floor battle between those lawmakers
who seek to defend the president's plan and others who argue that
some federal agencies work well just as they are and should be left
alone. The fight is expected to roil party lines, with Republicans
and Democrats on each side.</LD>
<LD>   Also at issue, inevitably, is turf.</LD>
<TE>   Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), chairman of the transportation
committee, is fighting to keep the Coast Guard's 43,600 employees
under the Transportation Department, which his panel oversees. FEMA,
now an independent agency with 5,100 employees, is another part of
the committee's empire that Bush wants to draw into the proposed
Department of Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   Young, usually a strong Bush ally, made plain Thursday the
president won't win without a fight. The Coast Guard, he said, does
far more than patrol seaports, and FEMA does far more than respond to
catastrophes like the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Roping the two agencies into homeland security, Young said, could
compromise Coast Guard missions, such as search and rescue, illegal
drug interdiction and protection of fisheries, and FEMA tasks related
to floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters.</TE>
<TE>   ''I have expressed these concerns to the president and to the
[congressional] leadership,'' Young said, complaining about the rush
in Congress to produce a homeland security bill. ''Legislation of
this significance deserves a more considered approach.''</TE>
<TE>   Working with committee Democrats, Young won approval for his
version of the homeland security bill on a voice vote. The nonbinding
recommendation from the 75-member committee, along with versions from
other panels, now heads to a group of House leaders. They are
scheduled to hammer out a bill next week before the issue moves to
the floor.</TE>
<TE>   As the transportation committee challenged the president, the
House leaders heard strong defense of the Bush plan from senior
Cabinet officials, including Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft.</TE>
<TE>   Powell, addressing questions raised about the State Department's
visa program, acknowledged that diplomats in consular offices around
the world have sometimes erred in choosing which foreigners should be
allowed to visit the United States. But he told a panel headed by
House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) that State remains the
best qualified department for the job.</TE>
<TE>   ''Have our efforts been defeated from time to time? From time to
time, do we have someone who does not live up to their
responsibilities? Yes, that has occurred,'' Powell said. ''But when
we find it, we go after it.''</TE>
<TE>   Despite criticism of the State Department in some quarters, many
lawmakers appeared to agree with Powell. Several committees have
ratified Bush's plan for homeland security to oversee visa programs
but for the State Department to run them.</TE>
<TE>   At the same hearing, House Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi (D-San
Francisco) criticized another portion of the Bush plan that she said
could erode civil service protections for federal employees in the
Homeland Security Department and weaken open-government laws, such as
the Freedom of Information Act. ''The good-governance issues are ones
that we must take very seriously,'' Pelosi said.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, however, pleaded with the
lawmakers to ''give the new secretary a substantial grant of
authority for flexibility.''</TE>
<TE>   On the open-government issue, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul D.
Wolfowitz said, ''You won't get a lot of information that is
extremely important in catching terrorists if everything is deemed to
be at risk of public exposure.''</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft spoke against a recommendation made Wednesday by the
House Judiciary Committee to split the Immigration and Naturalization
Service into one enforcement unit, under homeland security, and a
service unit, under the Justice Department. Frequently, he said, the
roles of border enforcement and immigration services overlap. ''To
have them in different departments might make very difficult the kind
of coordination that's necessary,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft's comments signaled that the matter could lead to more
debate on the House floor.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, several other House committees--Government Reform,
Agriculture, and Energy and Commerce--considered their proposed
changes to the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The agriculture panel, for instance, approved a version that would
alter Bush's proposal to draw an 8,600-employee unit of the
Agriculture Department into homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   Under the committee plan, which lawmakers said the Bush
administration would probably support, employees of the Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service who work at ports of entry to the
United States would be folded into homeland security, but others who
deal with eradication of crop diseases and pests would not.</TE>

<HD>Vaccine Shortage Over, CDC Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two-year shortage of two childhood vaccines--one for diphtheria,
tetanus and whooping cough and the other for measles, mumps and
rubella--is over, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta announced Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors can resume scheduled booster vaccinations for toddlers and
preschoolers that were postponed to conserve supplies. Infants,
considered most vulnerable, had continued to receive their initial
shots, but not follow-up inoculations.</LD>
<LD>   "We're relieved we have vaccine in time for the start of school,"
said Dr. Natalie Smith, immunization branch chair for the California
department of health services. Smith is with the Advisory Committee
on Immunization Practice, which made the conservation recommendations
to the CDC's National Immunization Program in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   No outbreaks were reported nationally as a result of the
shortages, health officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Renewed supplies of the vaccines still are being shipped to
doctors and hospitals so some will not be fully stocked for several
weeks, said Curtis Allen, the CDC program's spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an empty pipeline so there's a distribution lag," he said.
Parents should call physicians to verify that enough vaccine is
available.</TE>
<TE>   A number of factors contributed to the shortage of vaccines. The
only U.S. manufacturer of MMR, Merck &amp; Co., temporarily stopped
production to upgrade its facilities, the CDC said.</TE>
<TE>   A shortage of the tetanus component of the DTaP vaccine limited
production. Also, one major manufacturer of DTaP suddenly dropped out
of the market, said John Modlin, chairman of the CDC advisory panel.</TE>
<TE>   But two months ago, the Food and Drug Administration approved a
new vaccine, Daptacel, from another manufacturer, which eased the
shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Regulatory changes affected supply as well. In 1999 the CDC and
the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended removing a
mercury-based preservative from all vaccines, which caused several
companies to stop production.</TE>
<TE>   It can take a year from start to finish to make a batch of
vaccine, said Sara Radcliffe, a research director for the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which
represents drug companies.</TE>
<TE>   There is not a lot of incentive for companies to make older
vaccines, Modlin said. As a result, during the last 40 years, fewer
manufacturers have produced them, Radcliffe said.</TE>
<TE>   Two other vaccines still are in limited supply, Allen said.
Shortages of chicken pox vaccine should be alleviated by the end of
July or the beginning of August. And the recently approved
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, which prevents childhood pneumonia
and meningitis, may not be ready until year's end, the CDC spokesman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Wyeth Lambert, the only manufacturer of the pneumococcal vaccine,
has not met its demand since it was approved in October, Modlin said.</TE>
<TE>   Some organizations recommend that the CDC stockpile routine
childhood vaccines to guard against shortages.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation with MMR would have been much, much worse, but
there were some stockpiles," said Ann Margaret Arvin, professor of
pediatrics and microbiology at Stanford University and a member of
the CDC's National Vaccine Advisory Committee.</TE>
<TE>   But maintaining adequate supplies--and getting them to kids--is
key to preventing disease. "It doesn't take many susceptible children
to have an outbreak," Arvin said.</TE>
<TE>   Children typically receive five diphtheria, or DTaP, vaccinations:
at 2, 4 and 6 months with booster shots scheduled for 15 to 18 months
and again between 4 to 6 years. During the shortage, doctors held off
on the last two shots.</TE>
<TE>   Infants usually receive their first MMR shots at 12 to 15 months.
Without adequate supplies, however, physicians were asked to postpone
the second shot, typically administered from the ages of 4 to 6.</TE>

<HD>Terror Cells Active in U.S.</HD>
<DH>Security: Ashcroft tells Congress that Al Qaeda has
'sleeper' units here. Seventy-three people are still in custody in
the post-Sept. 11 probe, most on immigration charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER and ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Al Qaeda terrorist organization maintains an aggressive network
of underground "sleeper" cells in the United States and is trying to
smuggle even more terrorists into the country by having them pose as
ordinary visitors, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "Today the United States is at war with a terrorist network
operating within our borders," Ashcroft testified before a
congressional panel on homeland security. "Al Qaeda maintains a
hidden but active presence in the United States waiting to strike
again."</LD>
<LD>   Ashcroft's comments came as Justice Department officials disclosed
that most of about 1,200 people detained in the post-Sept. 11 dragnet
have been deported on immigration violations, though some were
released after being cleared of criminal involvement in the attacks.
Seventy-three people remained in federal custody Thursday, none on
charges related to terrorism. Most face immigration violations.</LD>
<TE>   Even so, Ashcroft said in his testimony that the Justice
Department has had many successes in rounding up suspects and
thwarting attacks in the 10 months since terrorists hijacked
commercial jetliners and flew them into the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "But we are not under any illusions," Ashcroft said. "There remain
sleeper terrorists and their supporters in the United States who have
not yet been identified in a way that will allow us to take
preemptive action against them."</TE>
<TE>   Of particular concern, Ashcroft said, are indications that
terrorists posing as tourists, businessmen and students are trying to
penetrate U.S. borders, hiding among the more than 700,000 visitors
who come each year from countries in which Al Qaeda has been active.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft's remarks came during a lengthy hearing before the House
Select Committee on Homeland Security, which is trying to reassemble
the nation's law enforcement, immigration and intelligence-gathering
agencies into one cohesive apparatus to prevent terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft did not discuss how many Al Qaeda operatives or other
terrorists may be hiding and plotting in the United States. An FBI
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, estimated that as many
as 500 people are under investigation nationwide, with as many as 200
of them being monitored.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, yes, there are ongoing investigations with regard to
individuals or groups in the United States, but we can't get into the
who, where, how and when," the FBI official said. "We don't want to
indicate to the individuals who are in that capacity that they are
under investigation and under surveillance."</TE>
<TE>   Federal law enforcement officials discounted a widely circulated
report Thursday that as many as 5,000 people in the United States are
Al Qaeda sympathizers. But they said many large cities in particular
are suspected of harboring terrorist cells, which use the local
Muslim community as cover and as a place to recruit sympathizers.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no focal point. Sure, they're looking at Seattle, sure
they're looking at San Francisco, sure they're looking at Detroit,"
said one Justice Department official. "Pick a city, any major city,"
including Los Angeles, which was targeted when an Al Qaeda terrorist
in 1999 plotted to detonate a bomb in a terminal at Los Angeles
International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "Our counter-terrorism folks are actively engaged in cities across
the country. We are not limited to New York and Washington, D.C.; we
are being vigilant everywhere," said the Justice Department official.
"They're following every lead. We're talking about thousands of
leads, and we're in a situation where we have to follow up on all of
them."</TE>
<TE>   The belief that sleeper cells still exist within the United States
is based on those investigations, as well as on intelligence gathered
from Al Qaeda detainees and other sources, according to a senior FBI
official.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents are also trying to ferret out people who they believe
are terrorist sympathizers and logistical advisors. They are doing
so, in part, by tracking suspicious financial transactions, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the FBI has been working with banks and financial
institutions to spot fraudulent Social Security numbers and other
"red flags," officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has recently discovered that three of the 19 hijackers
used fake Social Security numbers to open bank accounts, the official
said.</TE>
<TE>   "They just put a [fake] number on there," the FBI official said.
"That would have been a flag."</TE>
<TE>   The banks could have detected the fraudulent numbers had they
sought to verify them before authorizing the accounts, the FBI
official said. That would have triggered what is known as a
suspicious activity report. But "even if they had reported it, the
likelihood that anyone would have done anything with it prior to
Sept. 11 is minimal," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft himself said that such sophistication on the part of Al
Qaeda operatives underscores the difficulties that the new homeland
security agency will encounter in trying to dismantle the terrorist
organization, particularly cell members who have gone deep
underground.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda has trained its operatives to slip in and out of the
country unnoticed, and to exploit the often-gaping seams between
international and domestic counter-terrorism agencies, Ashcroft
testified.</TE>
<TE>   "In the months and years preceding Sept. 11," Ashcroft said, "our
weaknesses were among the terrorists' greatest strengths."</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft noted that his testimony Thursday came 10 months to the
day after the attacks, and said the ongoing investigation has
resulted in criminal charges against 129 people, mostly immigration
charges.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those cases involved immigrants from South and Central
Asia. Of those, 72 defendants entered guilty pleas and eight were
found guilty after trials were held, Justice Department officials
said Thursday. Six more cases were dismissed. The other cases are
still pending.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to those charged with crimes, 751 individuals were
detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service on federal
immigration violations. As of Thursday, 417 people had been deported
for violations and sent to their home countries, and "hundreds more"
who are in violation of the law are in the process of being deported
in connection with the investigation, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Muslim leaders said the fact that only a few dozen people from the
Sept. 11 investigation remain in custody--with none shown to have any
direct ties to terrorists--underscores their deep suspicions about
the way the FBI has conducted its investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "These were poor fish who got caught in the net because of some
immigration violation and had nothing to do with 9/11 in the first
place," said James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Jenny Salan, a spokeswoman for the Arab American Institute in
Washington, said the statistics show how the massive dragnet has been
a "waste of precious law enforcement resources."</TE>
<TE>   "This idea of picking up every Mohammed, Abdul and Ali--anyone
who's brown-skinned--is something that's just not going to bear
fruit" in finding terrorists, Salan said.</TE>
<TE>   During his testimony, Ashcroft defended the process.</TE>
<TE>   "For 10 months, we have conducted a campaign to identify, disrupt
and dismantle the terrorist threat," he told Congress. "For 10
months, we have been successful in protecting the United States from
another massive terrorist attack, using every appropriate legal
weapon in our arsenal."</TE>
<TE>   An FBI official also defended the numbers, saying most of those
detained after Sept. 11 were never considered terrorist suspects, but
rather people who, in the process of being investigated, were found
to be in the country illegally.</TE>
<TE>   A few dozen terrorist suspects were taken into custody as material
witnesses, and an undisclosed number of them are still being held,
the FBI official said.</TE>

<HD>Ariz. Fire Starter Defends Actions</HD>
<DH>Wildfire: Valinda Elliott says she was lost in the
wilderness, so she started a signal blaze. It became part of the
inferno that burned 469,000 acres and destroyed 467 homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>A woman reviled for setting one of Arizona's devastating wildfires
said Thursday that she had been lost in the wilderness for two nights
and was desperate to get the attention of a passing TV helicopter.
"You can't blame me for saving my life," she said.</LD>
<LD>   In her first extensive interview since she was rescued by the
helicopter June 20, Valinda Elliott told Associated Press that she
could not believe it when the signal fire she started with her
lighter became part of the inferno that destroyed at least 467 homes
and scorched nearly 469,000 acres before being contained.</LD>
<LD>   "If there was some other way I could have gotten that helicopter's
attention, I would have used it," she said.</LD>
<TE>   The blaze she started, named the Chediski fire, merged with
another to the east called the Rodeo fire, creating the biggest
wildfire in Arizona history. The combined blazes burned through
several communities last month and forced the evacuation of about
30,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the Rodeo fire was started by Leonard Gregg, a
part-time firefighter from Fort Apache Indian Reservation looking for
work. He pleaded not guilty to federal charges last week.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott said she has been questioned by the FBI and the Bureau of
Indian Affairs. She has not been charged with a crime.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI, BIA and the U.S. attorney's office would not discuss the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those driven from their homes were furious at her when
they learned how the fire began.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott said she became stranded in the wilderness after she and
her employer ran out of gas June 18 while driving through the remote
reservation. The two slept that night in her employer's truck, with
no sign of anyone around to help and no cell phone signal to call
911.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, she said, she became separated from her boss
while trying to find a place where her cell phone would work, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   She said she lost her way back to the truck and spent the second
night alone.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott said she drank from muddy pools, had no food and began to
worry that she would never be found.</TE>
<TE>   She used a lighter to set fire to a small bush the next morning
after she heard the helicopter, which rescued her, Elliott said.</TE>
<TE>   Her employer was rescued separately, she said.</TE>

<HD>El Nino Might Create Only a Peep</HD>
<DH>Weather: Minor shifts in temperature in the Pacific signal
a smaller, drier pattern than before. Even a stronger system wouldn't
ensure substantial rainfall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With an official pronouncement titled "He's baaack!" government
climate forecasters declared Thursday that El Nino had officially
returned--although in a weaker than normal state.</LD>
<LD>   Several consecutive months of slightly higher temperatures and
heavier than usual rainfall in South America led the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center to make
its announcement, even though some leading scientists are still
skeptical.</LD>
<LD>   Vernon Kousky, a NOAA meteorologist and climate specialist, agreed
that the current pattern is not a classic one but said it does meet a
technical definition for El Nino developed by the administration.</LD>
<TE>   "This time around, El Nino will not be as powerful as the 1997-98
event, but we'll track it closely for any change in its projected
strength," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Patzert, a satellite oceanographer at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena who tracks the temperature of Pacific waters,
said it still seems too early to conclude that a messy, stormy El
Nino season is heading toward California. "He's baaack? They're
making it sound like a poltergeist. It's more like one of the seven
dwarfs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Patzert, who has taken to referring to the weather system as "El
No Show," said that ocean temperatures are only about 1.8 degrees
above normal, not the 5.4 to 9 degrees of added warmth that accompany
a "whopper" El Nino.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little warmer at the equator than it was a year ago,"
Patzert said. "Whether that evolves into a full-blown El Nino, no one
knows."</TE>
<TE>   NOAA forecasters have been predicting for months that a weak El
Nino would develop. But the classic pattern--a dramatic ocean and
atmospheric disruption that sends warm water surging across the
equatorial Pacific toward South America to disrupt fisheries and
alter global weather patterns--had never materialized.</TE>
<TE>   Government weather forecasters said the system could "mature" and
lead to warmer, wetter weather in California this fall. El Nino
systems normally serve to suppress Atlantic hurricanes, but Kousky
said the system developing now is probably too weak to do so.</TE>
<TE>   The system is so weak now that Patzert questioned the point of
even making an announcement. Large El Nino patterns usually develop
in the winter, and only rarely in the summer, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "You could have a late-summer-developing El Nino, but then the
impacts don't hit us until December or January, so what's the sense
of screaming fire in a theater?" Patzert said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the temperature changes in the Pacific Ocean do develop
into what a majority of scientists consider an El Nino system,
Patzert said, it may not bring California any rain. In the past, he
said, small El Nino systems have led to very dry years in California.
"They're not all a repeat of '97 and '98," Patzert said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd hold off on fixing my roof and clear away brush from the
house," he said. "Our main problem right now is drought."</TE>

<HD>Polio Virus Created in Test Tube</HD>
<DH>Science: It's the first time a functional virus has been
made from scratch. Critics call the research irresponsible, citing
bioterrorism fears.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Using a genetic recipe from the Internet and mail-order DNA,
scientists in New York have built an infectious polio virus from
scratch, raising the grim prospect that bioterrorists could
eventually create their own virulent diseases in test tubes.</LD>
<LD>   The man-made concoction passed the ultimate test for a virus: It
successfully infected and paralyzed laboratory mice.</LD>
<LD>   The work, published today in the journal Science, was immediately
criticized by some scientists and bioethicists as irresponsible and
dangerous. Others called it a sobering glimpse of potential dangers.</LD>
<TE>   Virologist Eckard Wimmer of State University of New York at Stony
Brook said he conducted the controversial experiment to demonstrate
how easily bioterrorists could create deadly viruses for mass
distribution.</TE>
<TE>   "People have for the first time really come to realize that
written information that is available in the public domain about
viruses can be used to regenerate the real virus," Wimmer said.</TE>
<TE>   "Experts have talked about that in the past three years, but
nobody took it seriously," he said. "Now they have to take it
seriously."</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Defense already does. Wimmer's work was funded
by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Last year, the
Defense Department classified a paper written by Raymond Zilinskas, a
chemical and biological weapon expert at the Monterey Institute of
International Studies, suggesting it was possible to construct small
viruses from scratch.</TE>
<TE>   Zilinskas said he did not think the new report would be useful to
terrorists without the necessary scientific training and facilities.
But he added that a military laboratory could easily create and test
viruses. "You would need very good people," he said. "You would need
some time to do it, and you would have to do pretty thorough field
testing to make sure that whatever you construct actually worked."</TE>
<TE>   It took Wimmer's team nearly three years and several thousand
dollars' worth of raw materials to string together the virus, but
co-author Jeronimo Cello called the work "very easy to do."</TE>
<TE>   While the virus contains genetic material, it is not considered a
living entity, meaning the scientists did not "create life." All they
did was create a complex chemical, Wimmer said. Most scientists do
not consider viruses to be life because they depend on their hosts
for survival.</TE>
<TE>   The scientists downloaded the genetic code for polio and ordered
raw genetic material through the mail. They then undertook the
painstaking process of arranging each of the fragments in the proper
order to create their nearly perfect replica. They estimated that the
work could now be done in a matter of months.</TE>
<TE>   The creation of the man-made polio virus came just a month after
the World Health Organization had declared polio eradicated from
Europe and projected total eradication of the disease by 2005. Last
year, only 480 cases were reported in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Creating viruses from scratch now challenges the notion that any
virus can be truly eliminated. As Columbia University virologist
Vincent Racaniello said in Science: "Polio virus will never be gone."</TE>
<TE>   The fear is that terrorists could cobble together viruses more
lethal than polio, such as smallpox, the painful, disfiguring and
essentially untreatable scourge that has claimed hundreds of millions
of lives over the centuries.</TE>
<TE>   Smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980; the only known supplies
are kept in heavily guarded refrigerators at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta and the Russian Vector lab in
Siberia. Iraq and North Korea are believed to hold covert supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Polio was relatively easy to re-create because its genetic code
consists of just 7,741 molecular letters. Smallpox, in contrast, has
nearly 200,000 letters in its code and has a complicated geometry.</TE>
<TE>   "The polio virus is a pretty small genome," Zilinskas said. "To
get a larger virus, you would have to do everything correctly in a
three-dimensional structure, and that becomes quite a technical
feat."</TE>
<TE>   Wimmer agreed that it is unlikely terrorists would resort to
sophisticated genetic techniques to create viruses since many of them
are easily obtainable.</TE>
<TE>   The creation of the polio virus from scratch was not seen as a
huge scientific advancement and was considered inevitable by many
because of other basic research that made the feat possible.</TE>
<TE>   "This may be the culmination of sewing Frankenstein together, but
this is not the research that led up to Frankenstein," said C.J.
Peters, the director of the Center for Biodefense at the University
of Texas Medical Center at Galveston, for Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Many scientists criticized the work and called its publication
irresponsible and questionable. A spokeswoman for the American Assn.
for the Advancement of Science, which publishes Science, said the
group was considering adopting a formal policy on how to deal with
potentially dangerous research reports. But she defended publication
of the work as an important and exciting scientific advance.</TE>
<TE>   Wimmer defended the research as putting the world on notice that
terrorists could create weapons without getting their hands on
dangerous microbes. He said another lab would have done the work if
he hadn't. He added that the dangers of replicating polio were
minimal because most of the world has been vaccinated against the
crippling virus.</TE>
<TE>   He said there could be therapeutic benefits to the work. The
man-made virus had turned out to be less virulent than the original,
suggesting that the work could lead to new ways to disarm viruses and
create vaccines for other diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Bioterrorism expert Zilinskas agreed, saying: "There's undoubtedly
peaceful uses that will come out of that information. The unfortunate
part is that, with other powerful technologies, there may be misuse."</TE>
<TE>   Bioethicists said that in this new environment of bioterrorism
concerns, the possibilities for misuse could force new restrictions
on scientific journals and the sale of scientific material, both of
which have been relatively unfettered.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a wake-up call," said Alexander Capron, an expert in
bioethics and a professor of law and medicine at USC.</TE>
<TE>   "It raises an issue that most scientists are reluctant to
acknowledge: that results of great interest to scientists can be
dangerous as well."</TE>

<HD>Wooten Just Tees Off When the Tease Is On</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Responding to teammates' needling, he homers in
second at-bat of season, lifting Angels to 1-0 win over Royals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>Shawn Wooten was feeling pretty good about himself. In the first
at-bat of his first major league game in 11 months, he had singled.
Nothing pretty, mind you, just a ground ball that caromed off the end
of the bat and trickled past the second baseman. But, considering his
heartbeat and adrenaline were in overdrive, not bad.</LD>
<LD>   When he returned to the dugout, his teammates teased him, as they
love to do. Come on, big guy, can't you do any better than a little
ground ball?</LD>
<LD>   So he did. Next time up, he hit a home run in the sixth inning,
for all the offense the Angels would get, or need. Wooten's homer
supported a four-hit shutout by four Angel pitchers, with starter
Jarrod Washburn extending his winning streak to 10 games and the
Angels extending theirs to four with a 1-0 victory over the Kansas
City Royals Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   After Tim Salmon threw out A.J. Hinch at home plate in the third
inning, the Royals never advanced a runner past second base. And,
aside from Wooten's home run in the sixth, the Angels never advanced
a runner past first.</TE>
<TE>   But Ben Weber, Scott Schoeneweis and Troy Percival combined to
shut out the Royals over the final three innings, with Percival
converting his 14th consecutive save opportunity and 22nd of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Percival has not blown a save since May 30. Washburn has not lost
since April 13; his 10-game winning streak is the longest in the
major leagues this season.</TE>
<TE>   "That's 17 scoreless innings in a row," a reporter informed Angel
Manager Mike Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   "For us offensively or defensively?" Scioscia said, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   Uh, that would be for Washburn. But the offensive concern is
understandable, given that the Angels got all of six hits against
Darrell May, who pitched briefly in Anaheim in 1997 before heading to
Japan for the next four years. In another miserable summer for the
beleaguered fans in a good baseball town, May pitched a complete
game, and so even in defeat the crowd of 13,031 saluted him with a
standing ovation in the ninth inning.</TE>
<TE>   May threw 97 pitches. Washburn threw 102, and on a hot and humid
night Scioscia decided he was "zapped" after six innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' last five victories have come by one run, against
Kansas City, Tampa Bay and Baltimore. The Angels have scored 14 runs
in those games. It is not a promising sign that the offense is
sputtering, particularly when Monday brings the first game of a
20-game stretch against contenders Minnesota, Oakland, Seattle,
Boston and the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps Wooten can help. With the Angels trying to acquire
pitching help before the July 31 trading deadline, Wooten appears to
be the hitting help.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it's somebody within your own house that steps up,"
Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Wooten hit .312 as a rookie last year, but a wrist injury ended
his season in August. Two more injuries--a torn ligament in his thumb
and a strained muscle on his side--delayed the start of his 2002
season until Thursday. He can fill two roles for the Angels now, as a
designated hitter against left-handers and a power hitter off the
bench.</TE>
<TE>   He did not hit a home run in 60 minor league at-bats during his
rehabilitation assignment. He hit one in his second at-bat Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty nervous in my first at-bat, like it was my big
league debut," he said. "I just went up there hacking at everything.
In my second at-bat, I just relaxed, told myself to slow down, and I
got a good pitch to hit."</TE>
<TE>   And so he did, much to the delight of the teammates who delight in
teasing him. "We've all got to have an outlet," Percival said. "He's
everybody's outlet."</TE>
<TE>   He plays along, happily. He was tired Thursday night, after
playing in a minor league game in San Jose Wednesday night, getting
five hours of sleep and flying to Kansas City Thursday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "I need as much beauty sleep as I can get," he said, pointing to
his face. "This is pretty ugly."</TE>

<HD>Indians Fire Manager Manuel</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charlie Manuel was fired Thursday by the Cleveland Indians, who
opened the season's second half by making their biggest rebuilding
move yet.</LD>
<LD>   Manuel, who was in the final year of his contract with the
Indians, demanded a long-term deal during a Wednesday meeting with
club officials who had other plans.</LD>
<LD>   "I wanted Charlie to stay. I really did," Indian General Manager
Mark Shapiro said. "I'm really disappointed."</LD>
<TE>   Manuel, who had been in the Indians' organization since 1988, said
walking away was difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had great memories here," Manuel said when reached by
telephone. "Everything was great, except this.</TE>
<TE>   "It was tough. I love the Indians and the job."</TE>
<TE>   Manuel went 220-190 with the Indians. Third-base coach Joel
Skinner was appointed interim manager.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel's last appearance in an Indian uniform was Tuesday night as
one of the American League coaches at the All-Star game.</TE>

<TE>   Ruben Rivera, cut in spring training after stealing Derek Jeter's
glove, returned to the majors and was in Texas' starting lineup
against Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers also put left-hander John Rocker on the disabled list
and sent catcher Todd Greene to Oklahoma after he cleared waivers.</TE>
<TE>   Rivera signed a minor league contract with Texas in March after
his release by the New York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fred Wilpon sued Nelson Doubleday, his longtime co-owner of the
New York Mets to force him to sell him 50% of the team at the
$195.5-million price set by an appraiser.</TE>
<TE>   After Doubleday exercised his right to sell on Oct. 5, Wilpon and
Doubleday agreed to let the team be appraised by Bob Starkey, a
former Arthur Andersen accountant who has done extensive work for
baseball Commissioner Bud Selig and the Minnesota Twins.</TE>
<TE>   On April 12, Starkey appraised the team at $391 million--$269
million less than was paid earlier this year for the Boston Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Doubleday called Starkey's evaluation "artificially low."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Cry Fair</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They don't get any help from the umpires, and not
much from their defense, in 4-3 loss to Diamondbacks, who cut deficit
to 11/2 games to open second half.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was something foul about the Dodgers' 4-3 loss to Arizona
before 45,882 in Dodger Stadium on Thursday night, a defeat that
narrowed their gap over the Diamondbacks in the National League West
to 1 1/2 games.</LD>
<LD>   Or was it something fair?</LD>
<LD>   That's what the Dodgers were wondering after first-base umpire
Bill Hohn blew an eighth-inning call that prevented the Dodgers from
scoring the tying run in the first game of a critical four-game
series.</LD>
<TE>   With pinch-runner Hiram Bocachica on first base, two out and a
full count on Mark Grudzielanek, Bocachica was running on the pitch
as Grudzielanek lofted a fly ball down the line in medium right
field.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona right fielder Quinton McCracken, whose run-scoring double
in the top of the eighth had given the Diamondbacks the lead, raced
over and was in fair territory when the ball nicked off his glove and
hit the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Hohn waved the play foul as Bocachica rounded third, but replays
showed that the ball touched the turf about six inches inside the
line.</TE>
<TE>   Bocachica returned to first, and Grudzielanek took a called third
strike from newly acquired reliever Mike Fetters, ending the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona closer Byung-Hyun Kim retired the side in order in the
bottom of the ninth for his 23rd save, and the Dodgers headed to
their clubhouse to look at the replays, which only added to their
frustration.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious we had one taken away from us," Manager Jim Tracy
said. "It was a badly missed call at a critical point of the game.
The ball clearly tipped off his glove when he was in fair territory,
and it dropped in fair territory as well. I don't know how you can
miss a call when you're that close to it."</TE>
<TE>   Said catcher Paul Lo Duca: "That ball was fair, but if we play
good defense, it wouldn't even have mattered. That's the way I look
at it."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers looked rusty after the three-day All-Star break,
committing three errors in the first four innings after not
committing three errors in a game all season, and those miscues
contributed to a 3-2 Arizona lead.</TE>
<TE>   Struggling third baseman Adrian Beltre's two-out solo home run in
the sixth off Randy Johnson tied the score, 3-3, and two innings
later, Arizona Manager Bob Brenly had his own beef, disputing
third-base umpire Fieldin Culbreth's call on Steve Finley's drive to
lead off the eighth, a play that was ruled a double even though the
ball appeared to hit a fan's hands above the short fence in left
field before bouncing back into play.</TE>
<TE>   Two batters later, the question was moot.</TE>
<TE>   McCracken, who beat Dodger closer Eric Gagne with a two-run triple
in the eighth inning the last time these teams met, on July 3 in
Phoenix, delivered again, banging a two-out RBI double to
right-center for a 4-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers' Paul Quantrill (1-3), who had not given up a run in
16 appearances dating to June 2, a span of 12 2/3 innings, gave up
both doubles in the eighth after relieving starter Hideo Nomo to
begin the inning. Kim saved the win for Arizona rookie Mike Koplove
(1-0).</TE>
<TE>   Nomo, who was 7-0 with a 2.60 earned-run average in his previous
nine starts, and Diamondback starter Johnson, who was 5-0 with a 1.77
ERA in eight career games in Dodger Stadium, both pitched well, but
neither got a decision.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo gave up three runs--two earned--and six hits in seven
innings, striking out five and walking three.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson gave up three runs and six hits in a laborious six
innings, striking out five and throwing 124 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   While the Dodgers struggled defensively, the Diamondbacks looked
like baseball's version of the Steel Curtain, using three Gold
Glove-caliber plays to limit Dodger damage.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona left fielder Luis Gonzalez leaped at the wall to catch Lo
Duca's first-inning fly ball, just before Shawn Green's home run, a
solo shot that was his 27th homer of the season and 24th since May
21.</TE>
<TE>   McCracken robbed Lo Duca in the third, diving in the gap in
right-center to snag his drive just before the ball hit the turf, a
play that prevented the Dodgers from scoring more than one run in the
inning.</TE>
<TE>   And second baseman Junior Spivey raced straight back into shallow
right for an over-the-shoulder catch of Marquis Grissom's
sixth-inning blooper, a play that preceded Beltre's home run.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez's two-run single in the first wouldn't have been possible
had Dodger shortstop Cesar Izturis not dropped Craig Counsell's flare
to shallow center for an error, and Lo Duca's throwing error and
Brian Jordan's fielding error in left contributed to Arizona's run in
the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact remains we didn't play well in the first inning, when we
surrendered those two runs," Tracy said. "We had outs there for the
taking, and we didn't take them."</TE>

<HD>Dominican Signing Still Up in the Air</HD>

<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers' signing of Dominican pitcher Jonathan Corporan to a
$930,000 bonus remains on hold, while the dispute between the
6-foot-2 right-hander and U.S. Embassy officials in Santo Domingo
over Corporan's age extends to a fourth month.</LD>
<LD>   Corporan, who agreed to terms in early April and was believed to
have turned 17 on April 21, still hasn't provided enough
documentation to prove his age, and without the required paperwork,
he cannot obtain a visa that would allow him to enter the U.S.
Embassy officials believe Corporan is two years older than he claims.</LD>
<LD>   Team attorneys are now involved in the case, which could result in
DNA tests to determine Corporan's age. It's too late for Corporan,
whose fastball has been clocked at 93 mph, to join a minor league
team this season, so the Dodgers hope to sign him to a 2003 contract
and send him to instructional league this fall.</LD>
<TE>   "They're saying there's no way we can get a visa based on the
information they have now, and he and his agent have given them
everything they have," said Jeff Schugel, the Dodgers' director of
international scouting. "We're still trying to find answers. We're
exhausting all our resources. We want this kid; that's the bottom
line."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Exactly one month from the day he underwent surgery for a
herniated disk in his lower back, Kevin Brown played catch Thursday,
fueling Dodger hopes that the right-hander will be able to pitch
again this season.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who went on the disabled list because of discomfort in his
surgically repaired right elbow on May 27, has not completed the
five-step trunk stabilization program he began two weeks after back
surgery, but he was cleared to play catch. He is not expected to
throw off a mound for at least two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like a normal human being again," Brown said. "Even though
I could walk the day after surgery, I didn't have the stability I
would normally have. I'm a lot stronger now, in my legs and back.
Everything has been good to this point, but you just can't get ahead
of yourself."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Diamondback right-hander Rick Helling, who suffered a sprained
right ankle in a June 2 start against the Dodgers, has been scratched
from Saturday's start. Left-hander Brian Anderson, originally
scheduled to pitch Sunday night, was moved to Saturday, and
right-hander Miguel Batista will start Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona also activated Matt Williams, and the third baseman is
expected to start tonight. Williams, who suffered a fracture and
dislocation of his left ankle in spring training, will likely platoon
at third with Craig Counsell.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Diamondback manager, who led NL squad, says there
was no other choice and that having a winner isn't that important.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two days after managing in the biggest All-Star debacle in baseball
history, Bob Brenly said he still didn't have any answers.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know what we could have done different," said Brenly, the
Arizona Diamondback manager who managed the National League squad in
a 7-7 tie that was ended after 11 innings after both teams ran out of
players.</LD>
<LD>   Some have suggested, why didn't they just hold a home-run derby to
decide the winner?</LD>
<TE>   "Yeah, I heard about the home-run derby," Brenly said. "Fine, why
even play the game? Hold the Derby on Monday and everybody goes
home."</TE>
<TE>   Others are now talking about bringing more pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, so you take three more pitchers on each team, and each guy
goes two innings, and you're in the 16th inning and it's still tied,"
Brenly said. "Then what do you do?"</TE>
<TE>   Brenly, speaking before Thursday's game against the Dodgers, shook
his head.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's unfortunate that everyone feels somebody has to be
blamed for it," he said. "We played every player. A lot of guys got
two at-bats in an All-Star game, and I feel real proud about that."</TE>
<TE>   Wasn't it important to determine a winner?</TE>
<TE>   "Not for me, it wasn't," he said. "But obviously, for some people
it was. For me, it was one of the best All-Star games I've seen. Both
teams were winners.</TE>
<TE>   "The fans saw a great game, and I don't think blame needs to be
assigned.</TE>
<TE>   "It is what it is."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger second baseman Mark Grudzielanek agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "What do the fans expect them to do? Some of these guys are on
quality teams, playing for contenders," he said. "You can't risk
injury. They saw 11 innings, they saw every guy play, what else can
they do? It's an exhibition game. They did the right thing, no
question."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Tracy, Dodger manager, brought up a solution that had yet to
be mentioned.</TE>
<TE>   Why not include middle relievers on the All-Star teams?</TE>
<TE>   After all, during pennant races in recent years, they have clearly
been All-Stars.</TE>
<TE>   And they could pitch several innings, allowing the games to
continue.</TE>
<TE>   "Are there set-up men we can have on the team, guys who can be
extended more than a couple of innings, because that's what they do
normally?" Tracy said. "I certainly know of set-up men who would be
deserving."</TE>

<HD>Cup Has Been Running Under</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Sunday's rich Hollywood Gold Cup will have
only seven horses, which is an increase from last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although there was an unexpected entry, boosting the field to seven,
the 63rd running of the Hollywood Gold Cup is a prime example of how
a racetrack can run a major race for a lot of money and still wonder
where the horses will come from.</LD>
<LD>   The Gold Cup, Hollywood Park's premier race, was a hit from the
start when Seabiscuit, en route to the horse-of-the-year title, won
the inaugural in 1938. Since then, such horses as Challedon, Swaps,
Ack Ack, Affirmed, Criminal Type, Cigar and Skip Away have used the
Gold Cup as a building block toward national titles, but in recent
years the track has struggled to assemble quality fields. Last year,
only five horses ran and in 1999 there was a four-horse field, the
smallest ever.</LD>
<TE>   Martin Panza, Hollywood Park's racing secretary, and other track
hierarchy have tweaked the Gold Cup every way possible in an attempt
to bolster the 1 1/4-mile race. For a number of years, and as
recently as 2000, the stake was worth $1 million. For a time, during
the short-lived, ill-fated run of the American Championship Racing
Series, the Gold Cup was part of a multi-race bonus series. Another
bonus, coupled with winning the Santa Anita Handicap and the Pacific
Classic at Del Mar, came and went in the mid-1990s. In 1997, the Gold
Cup was changed from a handicap to a weight-for-age race, which
prevented horses from possibly giving away gobs of weight to their
opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "Then this year," said Allen Gutterman, vice president of
marketing at Hollywood Park, "we tried to get away from the Stephen
Foster by scheduling our race a little later."</TE>
<TE>   The $750,000 Gold Cup will be run Sunday, the July 14 date the
latest for the race since 1986. Since 1973, 23 of the 29 Gold Cups
have been run in June, but that month became less attractive when
Churchill Downs, now Hollywood's parent company, made a quantum jump
in the purse of the Stephen Foster from $150,000 to $750,000 in 1998.
The Foster, the biggest mid-year race for older dirt horses in
Kentucky, has been a June fixture on the racing calendar.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even though the eight-horse Foster was run a month ago, the
Gold Cup has lured only Dollar Bill, who ran a distant second to
Street Cry at Churchill Downs. Although he is 6-1, the fourth choice,
on the morning line, Dollar Bill is no drawing card, having lost nine
of his last 10 starts, usually at short prices, and frustrated
die-hard bettors all over the country.</TE>
<TE>   During the window that began in mid-May and runs through Aug. 3
with the running of the $750,000 Whitney at Saratoga, there are six
races worth $3.5 million for this division of horses. Actually, those
numbers are down from last year, what with the cancellation of the
Pimlico Special in Maryland, but nevertheless the pool of top horses
is small and it would be a mathematical contradiction if any of these
races came up with overflow fields.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a job keeping these horses together for an entire year,"
trainer Craig Dollase said. "Many of them drop by the wayside because
of injuries."</TE>
<TE>   Dollase, who finished first in last year's Gold Cup before the
stewards disqualified his Futural and moved Aptitude into the
winner's circle, is running a 4-1 shot, Momentum, this time. The 8-5
favorite is Milwaukee Brew, the Santa Anita Handicap winner who
prepped for the Gold Cup with a win over Momentum and others in the
Californian at Hollywood on June 15. Sunday's field grew by one when
Dig For It, an optional-claiming winner June 6, was entered.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Anita Handicap, which is run in April, is more likely to
draw more horses than either the Gold Cup or Del Mar's Pacific
Classic, which comes up in August. Milwaukee Brew beat 13 horses in
this year's Big 'Cap, and in the last 10 years the Santa Anita race
has averaged 9.5 starters, about 2.5 more per race than the Gold Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Dollase's reference to attrition is well-founded. Of the 14 horses
that ran in the Big 'Cap, only three--Milwaukee Brew; the speedy Sky
Jack, who is 9-5, and longshot Dig For It--are running in the Gold
Cup. None of last year's Gold Cup horses are back for the renewal.
Futural, a modest 3-1 favorite in the Big 'Cap, ran 12th and has
continued on a downward spiral. Dollase lost the 6-year-old gelding
to another trainer on an $80,000 claim at Hollywood a month ago, and
Sunday, the horse was unable to win on the California fair circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Street Cry, Lido Palace and Macho Uno, who could have added luster
to the Gold Cup, are based in the East, involved in campaigns that
include the Whitney and rich September stakes at Belmont Park. The
3-year-olds, who sometimes enhance the Pacific Classic--two of them,
Best Pal and General Challenge, won the Del Mar race--are a couple
months away from stepping up to face older horses. A 3-year-old
hasn't run in the Gold Cup in 30 years, not since Quack ran a
stakes-record 1:58 1/5 under 115 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why trainers don't ship out here as much as our guys
go back there, but that's the way it is," Dollase said. "Maybe it's
because the guys back east don't have that much luck out here."</TE>
<TE>   Skip Away was an invader when he won the 1998 Gold Cup, and so was
Sultry Song in 1992, but the roster of winners is mostly dotted with
hometown horses. Cigar, the 1995 winner, came from Belmont, but he
was a horse for any course, and was actually returning to the
stamping grounds where he failed as a grass runner early in his
career.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll just have to keep trying to be more creative," Gutterman
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood Gold Cup will be run as Sunday's fifth race. The
third race, the $500,000 Swaps, drew seven horses, including favored
Came Home, who'll be ridden by somebody other than the retired Chris
McCarron when Mike Smith takes over. Others entered in the Swaps are
Tracemark, Gobi Dan, Sugar Babe, Battler Bob, Like A Hero and
Fonz's.... In another stake on the card, the $200,000 A Gleam
Handicap for fillies and mares, Kalookan Queen, with 122 pounds, is
the high weight in a field of 10.</TE>

<HD>Enjoying Her Golden Year</HD>
<DH>Hughes' life has greatly changed since winning Olympic
figure skating title, but she has managed to keep her perspective</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She has met politicians and movie directors, thrown out the first
pitch at a New York Yankee game and been welcomed in cities she had
only read about.</LD>
<LD>   But no matter what heady honors Sarah Hughes has received since
she won the Olympic gold medal in women's figure skating with an
exquisite but powerful performance in February, she hasn't lost her
perspective--or her appreciation of how close she came to missing out
on all those thrills.</LD>
<LD>   "I've been pretty busy, but I've actually been having a great
time," said Hughes, who turned 17 in May and recently finished her
junior year at Great Neck High in New York. "I've met people I've
always wanted to meet and gone across the country on tour. I can't
wait to go to L.A., because that's where it all began."</LD>
<TE>   In truth, her Olympic odyssey began long before the U.S.
Championships in January at Staples Center, where the Olympic team
was picked. Yet, had it not been for her third-place finish in that
event--a disappointment after her runner-up finish the year before
and her bronze-medal performance at the 2001 World Championships--she
might not have developed the fire or the perfectly calibrated program
that propelled her past favorites Michelle Kwan and Irina Slutskaya
at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Without the second triple-triple combination jump she and coach
Robin Wagner added for the Olympics, and the intense mood Wagner
created by reediting her music from Ravel's "Daphnis et Chloe,"
Hughes might not have made the unprecedented leap from fourth place
after the short program to gold medalist. And Hughes probably
wouldn't be a headliner on the John Hancock Champions on Ice tour,
which stopped at the Long Beach Arena on Thursday night and will be
at the Arrowhead Pond on Saturday for matinee and evening
performances.</TE>
<TE>   "It made all the difference," Hughes said of enhancing the
difficulty and drama of her free skate program after the U.S.
Championships.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the most instrumental thing we did, and one of the
greatest moves I've ever made. And one of the most risky moves. I
knew it would be really great or really terrible."</TE>
<TE>   Her performance was a breathtaking blend of athleticism and
artistry. Skating with a nothing-to-lose sense of freedom, she became
the surprise winner when Kwan two-footed one jump and fell on
another, and Slutskaya couldn't match Hughes' demanding jump
combinations. A month after she had cried in frustration at the U.S.
Championships, Hughes cried tears of joy, a shining memory she will
carry the rest of her life.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen the tape several times," she said. "It was such a great
moment. But I really don't need to see the tape. I remember
everything."</TE>
<TE>   Those four minutes turned her life into a whirlwind. Besieged by
requests for appearances and endorsements, she limited her
acceptances so she could catch up on schoolwork. She did get her
picture on a Wheaties box, and she agreed to represent General
Electric and its "Heroes for Health" program. As part of her
involvement in the program, which commends achievements in medicine,
she will visit a hospital in Los Angeles this week to meet doctors
and researchers.</TE>
<TE>   She will also star in two skating specials for NBC, which is owned
by GE. The first will be taped this summer for showing later this
year, and the second will air next year. But as she chatted on a cell
phone on the way to a Champions on Ice performance last week, she was
like any busy teenager, grabbing a moment to relax in the back of the
tour bus.</TE>
<TE>   "I get more attention now, and I'm more recognizable, I guess,"
she said. "People recognize me for something so positive, so it's
nice to be able to share that with so many people who watched it.
That's what's been so stunning, that so many people saw it. That's
nice, because I feel I know a lot more people now."</TE>
<TE>   Also among the Champions on Ice stars are Kwan, the Torrance
native who added a bronze medal at Salt Lake City to her 1998 Olympic
silver medal, and Slutskaya, who won silver at the Olympics and won
her first world title in March in a field that lacked Hughes. Sasha
Cohen of Laguna Niguel, second at the U.S. Championships and fourth
at Salt Lake City in her Olympic debut, is also performing.</TE>
<TE>   Among the men, Olympic gold medalist Alexei Yagudin, silver
medalist Evgeni Plushenko and bronze medalist Tim Goebel, who trains
in El Segundo, are scheduled to skate. So are ice dance gold
medalists Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes knows audiences and critics expect more of her since her
exhilarating triumph, and she's prepared.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, what I did is not something that happens every day,"
she said. "I expect great things from myself, also. Maybe people will
expect me to win everything. If I knew I was going to win every time
or lose every time, it wouldn't be very interesting, would it?"</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens, Wagner expects Hughes to face it with poise.</TE>
<TE>   "Her world has opened up since Salt Lake City, but essentially
she's the same person," said Wagner, who toured briefly with Hughes
before leaving this week to begin choreographing programs for the TV
special.</TE>
<TE>   "She is intelligent and so aware of what's happening around her, I
think she will handle not always winning great. She's made it clear
her interest is competing and she wants to do well."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes has retained her Olympic eligibility and plans to compete
in Grand Prix events next season.</TE>
<TE>   "There are tons of things I'm working on," she said, "and next
season, that will be evident."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kwan, one of the sport's most accomplished competitors with six
U.S. championships, four world titles and two Olympic medals to her
credit, was not on the list of Grand Prix entrants released by the
International Skating Union last week. However, her agent, Shep
Goldberg, said she simply hasn't planned her future. If she decides
to compete in Grand Prix events, she can notify the U.S. Figure
Skating Assn., "and they'll do their best to accommodate her,"
Goldberg said.</TE>

<HD>Warrant Issued for Iverson</HD>
<DH>Jurisprudence: NBA All-Star charged with four felonies and
is expected to surrender to police Tuesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An arrest warrant was issued in Philadelphia on Thursday for 76er
star Allen Iverson for allegedly forcing his way into an apartment
and threatening two men while in search of his wife.</LD>
<LD>   Iverson, whose often brilliant style on the court has contrasted
with an often controversial lifestyle, is being charged with eight
counts ranging from simple assault, terrorist threats and gun
offenses to criminal trespass, according to Philadelphia District
Attorney Lynne Abraham. With four of the counts felonies, Iverson
faces up to 54 years in prison if convicted of all charges.</LD>
<LD>   The former league most valuable player, three-time All-Star and
rookie of the year, who led his team to the NBA Finals a year ago,
will be allowed to surrender to police Tuesday morning after his
lawyer returns from vacation, police Commissioner Sylvester Johnson
said. Until then, Iverson is not permitted to leave his suburban
Philadelphia mansion.</LD>
<TE>   "If Iverson is seen on the street or out partying, we will arrest
him," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson and his uncle, Gregory Iverson, are alleged to have pushed
their way into the apartment of Allen's cousin on the morning of July
3, seeking Allen's wife, Tawanna. According to the tapes of a 911
call obtained by the Philadelphia Inquirer, the 76er guard had thrown
his wife of nearly a year out of their home naked after a dispute
that, according to the paper, had stretched over two days.</TE>
<TE>   "The police did a thorough, complete and professional
investigation," Johnson said. "I'm very comfortable that the people
who have made the complaints are telling the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Gregory Iverson also has been charged in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Police searched the homes of both Allen and Gregory Iverson
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Two 76er officials expressed support for their six-year veteran
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is, he's not guilty right now," said Coach Larry
Brown, who has often clashed with Iverson over the player's work
ethic. "I'm hopeful this thing gets resolved and the kid can move on
with his life. He's part of our family and will always be a part of
our family."</TE>
<TE>   Said 76er General Manager Billy King: "We are supporting him
through the legal process. He is innocent until proven guilty."</TE>
<TE>   According to a police affidavit, neither Iverson's wife nor his
cousin, Shaun Bowman, were present at the Cobbs Creek Court apartment
complex when the incident allegedly occurred there. Bowman's
roommate, Charles Jones, and a friend of Jones were in the apartment,
according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson "continuously threatened harm to the complainants and
wanted Charles to make numerous phone calls to locate Tawanna and
Shaun," according to court documents. Iverson also "showed the
complainants a black handgun" that had been in his waistband, said
the report. Iverson does not have a gun permit, nor does he have a
gun registered in Pennsylvania, police said.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the apartment, Iverson and his uncle drove to a
motel where Tawanna had rented two rooms, but failed to find her
there either, according to police. When police encountered Iverson
and his uncle, the two were in the motel parking lot in search of
Tawanna's car.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Iverson nor his wife have commented on the charges.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the 27-year-old Iverson's first brush with the law.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested in a bowling alley brawl in Hampton, Va., in 1993
and spent four months in prison before being granted clemency. The
conviction was overturned on appeal in 1995.</TE>

<HD>Situation Not as Bad as Selig Described It</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Executive says crisis has passed. Experts say a
team folding during season is very unlikely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball officials backpedaled a day after Commissioner Bud Selig
claimed two teams face imminent cash-flow crises, saying Thursday
every club would make its upcoming payroll, though some might have
problems later this season.</LD>
<LD>   Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer and a labor
negotiator, moved to clarify comments Selig made Wednesday during
interviews in Milwaukee, raising the possibility of a team being
unable to pay its players next week and another folding this season
because of debt. Selig declined to reveal the supposedly teetering
clubs, increasing skepticism of the owners' cry of poor and
continuing their public-relations nightmare with collective
bargaining talks possibly resuming today in New York.</LD>
<LD>   Management sources, who declined to be identified because of a gag
order and threat of a $1-million fine, said no clubs would be
eliminated during the season.</LD>
<TE>   "I believe that the immediate crisis has been solved," DuPuy told
the Associated Press, "regarding the team that could have missed
payroll [Monday]."</TE>
<TE>   But Selig contradicted DuPuy when contacted by The Times late
Thursday in Milwaukee, saying nothing had been resolved.</TE>
<TE>   "That isn't quite accurate," he said of DuPuy's assessment of the
situation. "We hope it's resolved, but we won't know until [today] or
Saturday. The problem is, what happens a week from now? Or what
happens two months from now? The solution doesn't just rest on this
payroll."</TE>
<TE>   Selig's comments were perceived by players as a negotiating ploy,
trying to increase the heat on the Major League Baseball Players
Assn. with the sides still apart on key issues, including increased
revenue sharing among the clubs and a luxury tax on teams with high
payrolls. There was no way to corroborate the claims Selig made this
week or in May to The Times, having then claimed "six to eight
[teams] can't exist another year."</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit Tigers and Tampa Bay Devil Rays are two of the clubs
on Selig's list of strapped teams, executives said, but it is unclear
which clubs he refers to when explaining the owners' position,
further confusing the situation. And spokesmen for Detroit and Tampa
Bay said their franchises are doing fine.</TE>
<TE>   What is certain is that shutting doors would be the last of many
steps for a financially insolvent major sports franchise, and teams
in other sports have continued to operate even after filing for
bankruptcy. The NHL's Kings and Pittsburgh Penguins remained afloat
despite bankruptcy proceedings in the '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball awaits a contraction ruling from arbitrator Shyam Das,
who hopes to reach a decision Monday on the grievance filed by the
union, which could give Selig the ability to eliminate teams. But
that process is complicated, and one that likely won't begin this
season.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a number of reasons a team is not going to fold at this
point," said David Carter of the Sports Business Group, an L.A.-based
consulting firm. "There are scheduling difficulties, and just too
many logistical issues, to not think that any of these teams, either
by themselves or with some assistance from major league baseball,
would not be able to limp out the year. It's certainly inconceivable
that they would be shutting down any teams."</TE>
<TE>   Selig said 20 of the 30 franchises have reached the limit on the
$72-million lines of credit the commissioner's office established for
each team, and he would no longer prop up clubs that cannot meet
their obligations. But executives said baseball would bail out clubs
for at least the remainder of the schedule.</TE>
<TE>   If the situation is as dire as Selig claims, they said, clubs
probably would be put in receivership until a buyer could be found,
or contracted if Das rules in favor of the owners. But before
reaching that point, owners of strapped clubs could raise funds by
selling a stake in the team, providing an infusion of cash to meet
operating expenses. Franchises owned by corporations could seek loans
from parent companies.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings were the first modern-day major sports franchise in Los
Angeles to file for bankruptcy when the hockey team entered Chapter
11 proceedings in September 1995. The action punctuated almost two
years of financial chaos, which started with the swift unraveling of
former owner Bruce McNall's business enterprises.</TE>
<TE>   The era of financial uncertainty finally ended with the
bankruptcy, which paved the way for the approval of the sale of the
team about a month later from Joseph Cohen and Jeffrey Sudikoff to
Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz and Southern California real
estate developer Ed Roski Jr. In 1999, star center Mario Lemieux
assembled a group of investors to buy the Pittsburgh Penguins out of
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "Bankrupt companies continue to function all the time," Carter
said. "They have enough resources to keep going, and they're bailed
out for a period of time to reorganize. Just because someone is in
that state of affairs, it doesn't mean that they stop conducting
business."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball's divisional races would be affected if teams were
dissolved at this point.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, there are teams that are struggling," said Rick Burton,
executive director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the
University of Oregon. "But this concept of teams going under, meaning
they can't pay their players, that's the part that's hard to believe.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to believe that even a small-market team, like the
Kansas City Royals, would say, 'We can't make payroll, therefore we
are going out of business.' I have a problem with that."</TE>
<TE>   It is believed the commissioner's office bailed out the Arizona
Diamondbacks and Devil Rays in 1998, and baseball is bankrolling the
Montreal Expos this season.</TE>
<TE>   The commissioner's office also guaranteed a credit line for
Arizona in 2000, after the franchise had sought $53 million from
investors. However, the defending World Series champion denied it
needs another financial boost, having received $160 million from
current and new investors.</TE>
<TE>   "We have taken care of our business," owner Jerry Colangelo said
in a statement. "And I'm appalled that our organization continues to
be mentioned when financial inquiries arise."</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers, owned by pizza mogul Mike Ilitch, are also upset.
David Dombrowski, the club's president and general manager, denied a
Fox Sports News report that the franchise is having financial
problems.</TE>
<TE>   According to a spokesman for Vince Naimoli, Tampa Bay's managing
general partner, the Devil Rays are not experiencing severe cash-flow
problems, as has been reported after Selig's comments.</TE>
<TE>   "By being vague about which franchises are in trouble, it leads to
speculation about a lot of teams," Carter said. "That is not going to
help any of those franchises market themselves to corporations, or
even attract fans at the gate. That's another problem Selig is going
to have."</TE>

<LD>The sorry state of what to do with Ted Williams' body and his DNA,
his son having him frozen for posterity, has been a boon to
late-night humorists.</LD>
<LD>   From NBC's Jay Leno: "It was so hot, people were claiming they
were related to Ted Williams just so they could get their head
frozen." And, "The daughter wants to bury him. The son wants to
freeze him. And now Anna Nicole Smith wants to marry him."</LD>
<LD>   From CBS' David Letterman: "Today, Mike Piazza held a press
conference to announce he's not frozen."</LD>
<TE>   Among Letterman's top 10 good things about being cryogenically
frozen:</TE>
<TE>   * Never again have to answer the question, 'Hot enough for ya?'</TE>
<TE>   * If your name is Jim, friends and family will refer to you as
'Jimsicle.'</TE>
<TE>   * When they thaw you out in a few thousand years, you'll have lots
of stuff to watch on TiVo.</TE>
<TE>   * When you come back to life, you get to keep your frequent-flier
miles.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: With what team did Williams sign after graduating
from San Diego Hoover High?</TE>
<TE>   Proud papa: Dallas Maverick Coach Don Nelson, at a press
conference announcing the promotion of his son Donnie to president of
basketball operations, asked, "Are you my boss now?"</TE>
<TE>   Ambitious wannabe: Jerry Kelly, who won the Western Open last
week, is no shrinking violet.</TE>
<TE>   When told that his win moved him from No. 10 to No. 3 on the PGA
money list, Kelly said, "What it means is that I've got only two more
spots to climb. I'm trying to climb two more spots."</TE>
<TE>   That means past Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm No. 3 now and that's not No. 1. I am still striving to get to
be No. 1. You think I'm satisfied with being No. 3? No way. I'm
working harder to climb even higher," he told Dan Manoyan of the
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.</TE>
<TE>   Tough love: Terry Foster in the Detroit News: "So, the goal for
the Charleston RiverDogs was to be the first baseball team to have no
one attend one of its games. With the way the Tigers are playing,
aren't they headed in that direction too?"</TE>
<TE>   Logic 1A: In 1961, when Casey Stengel was building the New York
Mets as an expansion team, he selected catcher Hobie Landrith in the
expansion draft.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why he'd chosen a catcher, Stengel said, "If you don't have
a catcher, you have a lot of passed balls."</TE>
<TE>   School daze: How much would it be worth to follow NASCAR's Winston
Cup circuit to research a paper on "Southern Culture and Stock Car
Racing?"</TE>
<TE>   An anthropology student at UC Santa Cruz has received $20,000 in
grants for the task.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Chipper Jones, on what makes his Atlanta Brave
teammate, pitcher Tom Glavine, so effective, even though he doesn't
throw an overpowering fastball:</TE>
<TE>   "He makes a living feeding off other people's aggressiveness. It's
why Tommy Glavine is who he is and where he is in this game. You may
stand in the batter's box and salivate, saying, 'I can hit this guy.'
Then, three hours later, after you've been in a bunch of what you
would say are hitter's counts, he's hung an 0 and 4 on you. He's made
an art out of it."</TE>

<LD>It might not have been as satisfying to A.J. Foyt as winning a fifth
Indianapolis 500, but what happened last Sunday at Kansas Speedway
ranks high among his highlights.</LD>
<LD>   "It was like hitting a double jackpot at Harrah's," said the
67-year-old racing legend.</LD>
<LD>   His grandson, A.J. Foyt IV, won the first race of the Indy Racing
Infiniti Pro Series, and his other driver, former Brazilian jet skier
Airton Dare, won his first IRL race since joining Foyt's team last
February.</LD>
<TE>   "I was so happy for [A.J. IV], I could have cried and probably
did," said Grandpa Foyt.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, A.J. the taskmaster didn't let the kid celebrate for
long.</TE>
<TE>   "A.J. IV asked me if I still wanted him to work the Indy car race
as Airton's right-front tire changer. I told him, 'Hell, yeah! Just
because you won a race, it doesn't mean you don't have to work.' "</TE>
<TE>   In a way, it was the youngster's work on Dare's car that got him
his ride in the Infiniti series, a development program for the IRL.
On May 25, the day before the Indy 500, A.J. IV celebrated his 18th
birthday and the present from his grandfather was the seat in the No.
14 Harrah's Dallara.</TE>
<TE>   "He's done a hell of a job for Airton," said the proud
grandfather. "He's been changing that right front all year now and he
and Airton commute together. He stops Airton [coming into the pits]
and I send him out. We had some fast pit stops, we had a 7.5-second
stop, so you don't want to change your crew in midstream."</TE>
<TE>   Did A.J. expect his namesake to do so well in his first big race
since leaving the go-kart ranks a year ago?</TE>
<TE>   "Hell, no, I didn't expect that," he said. "The biggest thing I
wanted him to do was to keep his nose clean and not get in anybody's
way, and it's just one of those deals that everything was perfect. We
never turned a bolt on the car. It's just one of those days where he
adapted to it real quick. He had not tested and had no experience on
a track this size.</TE>
<TE>   "The race car performed well, the Infiniti engine performed well,
and he drove like a true champion. They put a lot of pressure on him
and he held up really well. I just kept telling him, 'Stay tight,
stay tight.' "</TE>
<TE>   A.J. IV not only won the race, he won the pole with a qualifying
lap of 180.330 mph, three miles an hour faster than the NASCAR
Winston Cup pole speed set by Jason Leffler last September.</TE>
<TE>   He took the lead from the start and led 63 of the 67 laps around
the 1.5-mile oval, losing the lead to Ronnie Johncox for four laps
before regaining it. After Foyt's main challengers, Johncox, Arie
Luyendyk Jr. and Aaron Fike were involved in a crash on Lap 47, Jason
Priestley of "Beverly Hills 90120" fame moved into second but was
never a threat.</TE>
<TE>   "It was exciting," the young Foyt said. "I have never run side by
side at these speeds with anybody. We did it for three and four laps
at a time, and nobody made a mistake until a couple of them got
together behind me and took out some good cars."</TE>
<TE>   A.J. said the race was probably more taxing on him than on his
grandson.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I drove a harder race on the radio than he did in the
car. He'll be hard to live with now, but like I told him, he's like a
racehorse. He broke his maiden. From now on, it's going to get harder
and harder."</TE>
<TE>   A.J. IV is familiar with race horses. He lives on a ranch near
Hockley, Texas, where his father, Tony, raises thoroughbreds.</TE>
<TE>   Dare's win, the first for a Foyt-owned car since Kenny Brack won
the Indy 500 in 1999, was quite different from young Foyt's. Rookie
Tomas Scheckter seemed to have the race in hand before he crashed,
giving the lead to IRL champion Sam Hornish Jr. with Dare running
second.</TE>
<TE>   "When they dropped the yellow and I saw that Scheckter was in the
wall, I thought I was happy for second place," Dare said. "Then when
A.J. told me that they're going to go green for a few laps before the
end, I started to think about winning my first race. As soon as they
dropped the green flag, I think Hornish missed gears or something and
he gave us an opportunity to go by him.</TE>
<TE>   "Since then, my cell phone has been busy with calls from Brazil,
all my friends. The race was on TV there. Then a lot of people are
telling me that I gave a big hug to my dad at the end of the race,
but that was actually A.J. My dad was in Brazil watching. I got a lot
friends in the media back home and they know that I was out of a job
in the beginning of the year and how hard it is to be with a good
team, which I am now."</TE>
<TE>   Early in the year, Dare was in Homestead, Fla., walking around the
pits with his helmet bag, when Foyt's driver, Donnie Beechler,
crashed and was hospitalized while practicing for the season opener.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just walking around, talking to a lot of people and a lot
of them were asking for millions of dollars to put me in a team,"
Dare said. "And I never, ever expected A.J. Foyt to call me, and then
when he did, I just went from there. I have to say, I have learned
more in six months than ever before in my career. Working with A.J.,
it's kind of like when you meet your first girlfriend. The more you
see each other, the more you know how each other works."</TE>
<TE>   Sprint Cars</TE>
<TE>   Rickie Gaunt has found a new way to win a main event in the Sprint
Car Racing Assn.--get confused on how many laps it is. The most
surprised person at Perris Auto Speedway on the Fourth of July was
Gaunt when he rounded the corner in the feature and saw the white
flag being displayed on Lap 29.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was 50 laps," he said. "I wasn't paying attention at
the pit meeting. I thought it was a Firecracker 50. When the white
flag came out, I thought I might win only because I didn't have
enough time to screw up."</TE>
<TE>   He won his ninth SCRA race and will be back Saturday night for
another 30-lap main.</TE>
<TE>   Points leader Richard Griffin, who has won at Tulare, Santa Maria
and Las Vegas, will be looking for his first win at Perris this year.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the program will be U.S. Auto Club Ford Focus midgets for
20 laps. Todd Hunsaker of Chino Hills leads Phil Goodwine of Mira
Loma by 37 points.</TE>
<TE>   Motorcycles</TE>
<TE>   Mazda Raceway, formerly Laguna Seca, will host the Honda
International Superbike Classic this weekend, featuring both world
and national championship races. In the world series, Australian Troy
Bayliss has won 13 of 16 rounds on his Ducati and holds a substantial
lead over Honda rider Colin Edwards of Conroe, Texas. Ben Bostrom,
whose brother Eric is one of the favorites in the national event, won
last year's round of the world championships.</TE>
<TE>   Nicky Hayden, 20, comes into Round 12 of the 16-race AMA national
series having won seven races on his Honda. With five rounds
remaining, Hayden has a shot at Fred Merkel's 1984 record of 10 AMA
superbike wins in a single season. He holds a 42-point lead over
Kawasaki's Eric Bostrom.</TE>
<TE>   Former supercross champion Jeremy McGrath, who is not riding in
the AMA outdoor motocross season, kept himself in shape last week by
winning three races in the 35th Mammoth Motocross event. Just after
his 30th birthday, McGrath won his first vet pro main event, plus the
125cc and 250cc features. The seven-time champion plans to marry
fiance Kim Maddox next month.</TE>

<HD>Irwin Takes Command Again at Senior Players</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It doesn't just seem as if Hale Irwin always plays well at the Senior
Players Championship. He does.</LD>
<LD>   Irwin set nine-hole and first-round records Thursday in taking a
two-shot lead in the Senior Players Championship at the TPC of
Michigan in Dearborn, Mich.</LD>
<LD>   Irwin, who birdied six of the first seven holes, shot a
seven-under-par 29 on the front nine and finished with an eight-under
64 to continue his trend of playing well at the fourth and final
major on the Senior PGA Tour.</LD>
<TE>   He won here in 1999 and has finished second twice and has tied for
fourth or better five of the last six years.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin has shot in the 60s in 18 of 29 rounds and owns the
tournament record with a 68.86 scoring average.</TE>
<TE>   "This may sound stupid, but I think it's kind of a tough course,"
Irwin said. "I think because of that, I play it very carefully. I
think it makes me more aware of being a little more focused. Maybe
being a little more intent upon the right shot, rather than just sort
of pulling a club and hitting it."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart Ginn was alone in second with a 66. Mark McCumber, who
took Jack Nicklaus' place after he withdrew Wednesday because of
muscle spasms, shot a 67 as did Tom Jenkins, who won last week's
Canadian Senior Open.</TE>
<TE>   Three others were four strokes behind Irwin.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin's 64 fell one short of the course record, which Jim Colbert
set in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The previous nine-hole record at the Senior Players Championship
was 30, set by five players, including Irwin three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Wargo aced the 192-yard fourth on his way to a 71.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bo Van Pelt, whose best finish is a tie for 20th at the 1999
Canadian Open, shot a seven-under 64, one shot behind leader Tommy
Armour III in the opening round of the Greater Milwaukee Open.</TE>
<TE>   Also at 64 were Kenny Perry, Deane Pappas and Jeff Sluman.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Shigeki Maruyama was two shots off the lead at
65 along with Steve Stricker, Bryce Molder and Kelly Gibson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Justin Rose got off to a fast start while others dodged the rain
to take a one-stroke lead after the first round of the Scottish Open
at Luss, Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   Rose, winner of four tournaments this year, was five under at the
turn and, after bogeys at Nos. 11 and 12, added three more birdies
for six-under 65.</TE>
<TE>   Former Masters and British Open champion Sandy Lyle had a
four-under 67 to tie for fourth and two-time U.S. Open champion Ernie
Els was in a group at 68 that also included Americans Brad Faxon and
Dean Wilson, along with European Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On a day when everyone else struggled with the wind, Rachel Teske
strung together four birdies to shoot a 67 and grab the first-round
lead in the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic at Sylvania, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion and three-time Farr winner Se Ri Pak stumbled
to a 72, her first round over par at the tournament since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Lopez, making her LPGA farewell tour, received a warm
reception from the large galleries that followed her around Highland
Meadows Golf Course. She shot a 74.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Taylor Dent and Robby Ginepri advanced to the semifinals of the
Hall of Fame Championships at Newport, R.I.</TE>
<TE>   Dent defeated fifth-seeded Alexander Popp, 6-3, 6-2, in 58
minutes. Ginepri was even faster, ousting 2001 finalist Martin Lee,
6-3, 6-1, in only 45 minutes. Both players advanced to their first
semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second-seeded Juan Carlos Ferrero was upset by fellow Spaniard
David Sanchez, 5-7, 6-4, 6-3, in the second round of the Swiss Open
at Gstaad, Switzerland.... Two-time champion Magnus Norman of Sweden
rallied to defeat Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia, 2-6, 6-4, 6-2, to
advance to the quarterfinals of the Swedish Open.... Top-seeded
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario cruised into the quarterfinals of the French
Community Championships at Brussels with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Gala
Leon Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   Hockey</TE>
<TE>   Lorne Henning and Paul MacLean have been hired as assistant
coaches for the Mighty Ducks. Henning, who won two Stanley Cups while
playing the New York Islanders, was previously the coach of the
Minnesota North Stars (1985-87) and Islanders (1994-95). He also was
an assistant for the Islanders and Chicago Blackhawks.</TE>
<TE>   MacLean, who played 11 seasons in the NHL, spent the last 10
seasons as a minor league coach, the last two as coach of the Quad
City Mallards of the United Hockey League.</TE>

<TE>   Former New Jersey forward Bobby Carpenter, part of two Devil
Stanley Cup championship teams, is returning to New Jersey as an

<HD>Braves Stretch Out Lead Over Expos</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Atlanta Braves picked up right where they left off.</LD>
<LD>   Andruw Jones and Gary Sheffield hit three-run home runs Thursday
as the Atlanta Braves returned from the All-Star break by beating the
Expos, 8-5, at Montreal.</LD>
<LD>   Atlanta won for the 38th time in 49 games, opening a 10 1/2-game
lead over second-place Montreal in the National League East and
improving the best record in the major leagues to 57-32.</LD>
<TE>   "We played so well in the first half and to open it up against a
team in our division, it makes it really tough," Sheffield said. "We
got off to a good start."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Millwood (7-5) won his fifth consecutive decision despite
allowing three home runs, two to Vladimir Guerrero.</TE>
<TE>   Millwood, who hasn't lost since May 18, gave up four runs and six
hits in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   John Smoltz struck out the side in the ninth for his 32nd save,
tying the Dodgers' Eric Gagne for the major league lead.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a nice place to start the second half, especially with a
team that's going to make a charge," Millwood said. "We want to keep
moving."</TE>
<TE>   Following the game, the Expos acquired power-hitting outfielder
Cliff Floyd from Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Floyd, who began his career with the Expos and recently said he'd
welcome a trade back to Montreal, was hitting .287 with 18 home runs
and 57 runs batted in heading into the All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to be a help to their ballclub," Sheffield said. "He's
an All-Star. He does it all."</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield hit an RBI single with one out in the first and Jones
hit his 20th homer off Tony Armas Jr. (8-8) for a 4-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "It's awful tough against any ballclub but when you're going
against the best ballclub in the division and you spot them four,
it's tough to come back from that in the first inning," Expo Manager
Frank Robinson said.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Schneider homered in the third and Guerrero in the fourth as
the Expos closed to 4-2, but Sheffield homered in the fifth, his 16th
of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero hit a two-run homer in the sixth, giving him 17
multi-homer games in his career and 21 homers this season.</TE>
<TE>   Pinch-hitter Andres Galarraga homered off Kevin Gryboski in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   "We had plenty of ballgames left and we tried to come back, but
the three in the fifth kind of took us out of the game and there's
nothing you can do about that," Robinson said.</TE>
<TE>   New York 9, Philadelphia 1--Roberto Alomar doubled to key an
eight-run burst in the eighth inning and capped it with an RBI single
as the Mets won at New York. Mike Piazza and Timo Perez each drove in
three runs for the Mets.</TE>
<TE>   After the Phillies tied it in the top of the eighth with a run off
Al Leiter, the Mets broke it open.</TE>
<TE>   Alomar's double scored Perez to start the scoring in the eighth.
The Mets ripped off five hits in a row after that, including a
two-run triple by Piazza. Perez hit a three-run double with two out
and scored on a single by Alomar.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 4, Cincinnati 3--Geoff Blum hit a three-run homer and Roy
Oswalt pitched seven-plus innings to lead the Astros at Houston.
Oswalt has won five of seven decisions. Billy Wagner pitched the
ninth for his 15th save in 18 chances for the Astros, who have won
nine of 11.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Boone gave Cincinnati a 1-0 lead with his 13th homer in the
first inning, but Oswalt (10-5) then retired 13 of 15 batters until
he walked two in the sixth and loaded the bases with one out. The
Astros have won their last four series.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 3, Milwaukee 2--Two days after the All-Star game
finished in an unpopular, 11-inning tie at Miller Park, Brian Giles
hit a home run in the 10th to help the Pirates win at Milwaukee.
Giles hit his 23rd homer with one out off Mike DeJean (0-4).
Milwaukee's Jose Hernandez tied it at 2-2 in the eighth by hitting a
430-foot homer off Josh Fogg.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 3, Colorado 2--With the score tied in the ninth
inning, J.T. Snow hit a one-out triple off Jose Jimenez and Reggie
Sanders followed with a groundball single to center to bring home the
winning run for the Giants at San Francisco.</TE>

<LD>Bruce Gaudino knew his swim would be fruitful long before he dove in.</LD>
<LD>   He saw baitfish fluttering at the surface, chased there,
obviously, by much larger predators.</LD>
<LD>   He noticed scales floating in large patches, an indication that
predators were indeed in the vicinity--and that they were feeding.</LD>
<TE>   "I tell you, it's hard to keep your heart rate down when you see
all of those things," the Brea chiropractor said of last week's
spearfishing adventure off La Paz, with friends Mike Marsh and Todd
Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   The adrenaline really started flowing when Gaudino glimpsed a few
tuna during his first breath-hold dive, and it coursed through his
veins when he poked his head under for another look and saw, in the
wavering haze, what appeared to be a large torpedo, silhouetted
beneath the rays of the sun.</TE>
<TE>   But the torpedo had pectoral fins.</TE>
<TE>   Gaudino tried not to make any sudden moves and was able to drift
closer, closing the gap enough to discover that he had stumbled upon
the biggest wahoo he had ever seen, one that no longer looked like a
torpedo, but the submarine that fired the torpedo.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking for serial numbers on that thing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He then sucked in a breath of air and dove slowly, parallel to and
eventually toward his saw-toothed quarry, gave a few swift kicks,
extended his gun and pulled the trigger.</TE>
<TE>   Line zipped from and broke free of his gun, as it is supposed to
do, and Gaudino grabbed hold of the float attached to the end of the
line. Once back on the surface, he leveled out on a plane to keep
resistance to a minimum, "and I enjoyed the ride."</TE>
<TE>   Not long thereafter, when the wahoo was sapped of its strength,
Gaudino slipped one hand beneath its gill plate to steady the head,
and wrapped his free arm around the "waist" of the fish to steady its
body.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like hugging a human," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The skipper of the skiff that brought the trio to the fishing
grounds, just northeast of Cerralvo Island, whisked in and picked up
the prize. Back in La Paz, it measured 72 inches long and 34 1/2
inches around.</TE>
<TE>   Its weight varied on three scales from 125 to 130 pounds, and dive
experts at La Concha Resort's Cortez Club this week were getting the
scales recertified and trying to come up with an official weight.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the weight turns out to be, the fish, if approved by the
two spearfishing world record bodies, will replace in the books an
84-pound wahoo shot by Ron Mullins in November 1996 at Thetis Bank
off Baja California's west coast. (The all-tackle rod-and-reel world
record is a 158-pound 8-ounce wahoo caught off Loreto in June 1996.)</TE>
<TE>   Gaudino, who booked his trip through Tail Hunters Fishing and
Adventures in Hacienda Heights, credits a higher power for what he
called an opportunity of a lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   "The story behind the story is that I had said a little prayer
beforehand," he said. "I asked for a 120-pound fish to come straight
toward me and turn in front of me, and that's what I got."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Those wanting to learn more about free-diving and spearfishing can
attend a daylong clinic beginning at 11 a.m. Saturday at Liburdi's
Scuba Center in Costa Mesa. Veteran hunter Al Schneppershoff will
discuss equipment, techniques, rules, shallow-water blackout, fish
habits and safety. Cost is $65. Details: (714) 662-7230.</TE>
<TE>   Baja Beat</TE>
<TE>   * San Quintin: Those traveling south of Ensenada to this quaint
but wind-swept piece of paradise had for the last several weeks been
forced to settle for rockfish because of unusually cold water (as low
as 53 degrees). But Gene Allshouse of San Quintin Sportfishing on
Wednesday happily reported that warmer water had finally moved in and
that albacore schools were being encountered only 15 miles out.</TE>
<TE>   * East Cape: Mark Rayor is a dive master based in Buena Vista. But
on his days off he likes to stay above water and fish for the big
ones. Two weeks ago off Punta Pescadora he was rewarded with the
strike of a blue marlin that was subdued in less than two hours. It
weighed in at 550 pounds, making it the largest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   * La Paz: Las Arenas Resort, which sits alone on the white-sand
beach about 30 miles southeast of La Paz, will close Aug. 5 for
renovations. It is expected to reopen in October, spokeswoman Linda
Glassman-Davis said. The booking office in San Diego will close July
25.</TE>
<TE>   * Cabo San Lucas: The frigid water that had been scaring away fish
and fishermen has warmed considerably in the last few days, to a
still unseasonably cool average of 72-74 degrees in the Sea of
Cortez. It's even cooler on the Pacific side.</TE>
<TE>   "The fishing has definitely gotten better this week," a
spokeswoman for Pisces Sportfishing said. But the fishing is far from
hot.</TE>
<TE>   Local Saltwater</TE>
<TE>   * Inshore: Captains and landing operators from L.A. Harbor to
Oceanside are calling this week's sand bass bite one of the best in
recent history. The fish are piled up on the ocean floor from San
Onofre to Huntington Beach, biting morning, noon and night. "The
[twilight boat] Enterprise on Wednesday night had 86 people and they
caught 860 sand bass--now that's pretty impressive," said Don Ashley,
owner of Pierpoint Landing in Long Beach. Schools of breezing
barracuda have made things interesting from top to bottom.</TE>
<TE>   * Offshore: Albacore were not difficult to find Thursday for
anglers aboard San Diego boats in Mexican waters. Huge schools could
be seen breaking the surface in feeding frenzies. Not surprisingly,
most boats were returning to port Thursday afternoon with full sacks.
Meanwhile, there is more effort in U.S. waters beyond Cortez Bank
after Pierpoint Landing's Toronado returned Wednesday night with 130
albacore averaging 12-25 pounds. The fish were biting in the area
again Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Local Freshwater</TE>
<TE>   * Castaic Lake: The popular Los Angeles County Reservoir will be
closed Tuesday morning for water quality tests and treatment by the
California Dept. of Water Resources. The lake will reopen at about 1
p.m. The lower lake, or lagoon, will not close. Details: (661)
257-4050.</TE>
<TE>   * West Walker River: It's not that local, but the Eastern Sierra
river is popular among Southland anglers and they'll be delighted to
learn that "bonus plants" of trophy-sized brown and rainbow trout
will take place periodically through August. The extra plants, of
fish provided by the Sierra Trout Foundation and Alpers Ranch, are
designed to lure tourists who stayed away during a recent wildfire.</TE>
<TE>   * Whittier Narrows Regional Park: The park's annual all-night
catfish derby is tonight, beginning at 6 and lasting until 6 a.m.
Saturday. The event, featuring trophies and raffle prizes, is free
but there's a $3 vehicle entry fee. Participants will be able to
pitch tents along the lake shore. Details: (626) 575-5526.</TE>
<TE>   Bragging Rights</TE>
<TE>   * Saltwater: A group of anglers aboard Bongos II out of Davey's
Locker in Newport Beach on Monday teamed to boat a 241-pound
swordfish after a fight lasting nearly two hours. The catch was made
85 miles offshore. The anglers, reeling in shifts, were Jim Gore of
Riverside, Warren and Barry Coalson of San Diego, Dennis Fransway of
San Diego and John Rains and Ken Moses of Hesperia.</TE>
<TE>   * Freshwater: Chad Johnson of Los Angeles spent his 10th birthday
in the Eastern Sierra and celebrated by reeling in a 5-pound 10-ounce
rainbow trout at South Lake near Bishop.</TE>
<TE>   The Three Rs</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Fish and Game is offering 40 special pheasant
hunts it says are designed to "recruit new hunters, retain current
hunting families and return past hunters to the field."</TE>
<TE>   Family, women's and junior hunts are scheduled this fall and
winter throughout Los Angeles, San Diego, Ventura and Santa Barbara
counties. The hunts are free and applications must be received by
Sept. 1. Details can be obtained in the "Hunting in California"
section of the DFG Web site (www.dfg.ca.gov) or by calling (562)
590-5100.</TE>
<TE>   Catching Air</TE>
<TE>   * Bass fishing: ESPN and ESPN2 will televise "Bass Week" at
various times beginning July 21 and show same-day coverage of the
CITGO Bassmasters Classic July 25-27.</TE>
<TE>   The tournament, featuring 52 of the world's top anglers vying for
the world title, will take place on Lay Lake near Birmingham, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion is Kevin VanDam, who Wednesday night was
awarded the inaugural ESPY Award in the best outdoor sports athlete
category. "Awesome," he said of the honor. "The coolest part of the
whole thing was having John Madden hand me the award."</TE>
<TE>   * Miscellaneous: The ESPN Great Outdoor Games began a four-day run
Thursday. Athletes from the U.S., Australia, the Bahamas, Canada and
New Zealand have gathered at Lake Placid, N.Y., to compete in events
including timber rolling, target shooting, sporting dog competition
and fishing. The Games will air on ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC beginning July
20.</TE>
<TE>   Winding Up</TE>
<TE>   The top women's longboard surfers will take the spotlight in
Malibu this weekend during the U.S. Women's Professional Longboard
Championships at Surfrider State Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Competition, from 6:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, will
feature categories for all ages and even a men's exhibition called
the Malibu Heels-Over Championship in which competitors will attempt

<HD>Dodgers Will Need Map to Discover This Division's Treasure</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On the first day of the rest of the season, Craig Counsell of the
Arizona Diamondbacks was talking about the new Dodgers and
old-fashioned pressure.</LD>
<LD>   It was a pregame interview.</LD>
<LD>   It could have been a soundtrack for the first inning of Thursday's
game.</LD>
<TE>   "When it gets down to those games in September for them, it will
be a little uncharted."</TE>
<TE>   Hideo Nomo walks leadoff hitter Tony Womack.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be games you lose, you will start wondering."</TE>
<TE>   Counsell hits a soft double-play pop fly that Cesar Izturis drops.
"There are times you will need to tighten the ship."</TE>
<TE>   Junior Spivey hits a grounder that Adrian Beltre catches, then he
falls and throws wildly to first. "There are times you cannot give in
to that tough loss."</TE>
<TE>   Luis Gonzalez hits a soft pop to left field that Brian Jordan
tentatively allows to drop, scoring one run. "For us, that is no
longer an issue."</TE>
<TE>   For the Dodgers?</TE>
<TE>   That is the only issue.</TE>
<TE>   They began the official second half of the season Thursday leading
the World Series champion Diamondbacks, but chasing them.</TE>
<TE>   In first place, but the last team expected to stay there.</TE>
<TE>   Thrilled at their journey, but now working without a map.</TE>
<TE>   "Eighty-eight games into the season, we're not an accident
anymore," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   It is a statement to which--judging by the quick boos that filled
crowded Dodger Stadium on Thursday--their fans have one response.</TE>
<TE>   Oh yeah?</TE>
<TE>   Then prove it.</TE>
<TE>   Prove it against a team that was beaten senseless last fall in the
Bronx, then staggered home three days later to win a championship.</TE>
<TE>   Prove it with something other than what they showed Thursday, when
they committed three errors in the first four innings then blew three
comebacks in a 4-3 loss.</TE>
<TE>   They came back from a 2-0 deficit against Randy Johnson to tie it
at 2-all, yet Jordan botched a short fly to left field and the
Diamondbacks took the lead.</TE>
<TE>   They came back from a 3-2 deficit to tie it at 3-all, yet Paul
Quantrill gave up two fence-banging drives, including Quinton
McCracken's RBI double in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Umpire Bill Hohn blew a call that would have allowed Mark
Grudzielanek to drive in the tying run in the eighth, but the Dodgers
wouldn't have been in that position without making their own
mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   All of this happened against a Diamondback team that, with Matt
Williams and Erubiel Durazo and Matt Mantei returning from injuries,
feels it has not yet begun to fight.</TE>
<TE>   "For us to be where we're at right now, after the way we've played
in the first half, I'm pretty happy with it," Arizona Manager Bob
Brenly said. "I don't think we've hit any kind of rhythm all season."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have found that rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   Now that they are in first place at the All-Star break for the
first time in eight years, they need to turn the neat trick of
maintaining it while becoming tone deaf.</TE>
<TE>   They need to ignore the praise, shut out the boos, let the heat
roll off their backs like the beads of perspiration last week in St.
Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing for these Dodgers is going to come easy.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody knows that better than the Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "It all comes down to the character of your team," Arizona catcher
Damian Miller said. "It's all about how your team reacts to the bad
times. We've done that."</TE>
<TE>   Until this season, the Dodgers have had more characters than
character.</TE>
<TE>   The last time they were in a truly important pennant race game
against the Diamondbacks, last fall, Gary Sheffield was thrown out
for arguing strikes in the first inning and the team collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   The last time the Diamondbacks were in a similar situation,
Gonzalez hit a looping single against Mariano Rivera and made
history.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we don't panic," Counsell said.</TE>
<TE>   Do the Dodgers? Will the Dodgers?</TE>
<TE>   Deep down, they are as curious as everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm anxiously awaiting," Tracy said, quickly adding, "but I say
that with the utmost confidence. I'm excited for them."</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks admit that they see a little of themselves in the
other dugout.</TE>
<TE>   Said Counsell: "We know the Dodgers are for real."</TE>
<TE>   Said Mark Grace: "They've got guys who have been around, they've
got a manager they respect, they're not going anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   But where exactly are they going?</TE>
<TE>   Wherever it is, they better bring their sunscreen.</TE>

<HD>UEFA Leaders Make Changes to Schedule</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>European soccer leaders took action on a variety of fronts Thursday
in an effort to streamline the sport on the club and national team
levels.</LD>
<LD>   To begin with, the executive committee of the Union of European
Football Assns. (UEFA) announced in Nyon, Switzerland, that UEFA will
withdraw from the FIFA Confederations Cup after the next two
tournaments, in 2003 and 2005.</LD>
<LD>   "We will not participate [after that], but it would be wrong to
step out now," said Lennart Johansson, UEFA's Swedish president.
"This competition will not be here to stay."</LD>
<TE>   The Confederations Cup, an eight-nation tournament favored by FIFA
President Joseph "Sepp" Blatter, is held every other year and
features the champions of each of FIFA's six continental
confederations plus the World Cup winner and host nation.</TE>
<TE>   Australia, France and the United States are bidding for the 2003
event, with Germany scheduled to be the host in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Johansson also indicated that UEFA is contemplating withdrawing
from the FIFA World Club Championship, the most recent version of
which was scheduled for Spain last year before financial difficulties
caused its indefinite postponement.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, UEFA changed the format of its most popular and
financially lucrative competition, the Champions League.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in the 2003-2004 season, the competition will continue to
begin with 32 teams drawn into eight groups of four for first-round
play, but the second round involving 16 teams will no longer be in
group format but will become a two-legged knockout competition with
home and away matches.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not easy to change a competition which is recognized as the
best club event in the world, but sometimes you need to act for the
future," Johansson said.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe this reduction in the size of the competition [the
number of games played] is in the longer-term interests of everyone
involved--clubs, players, fans, broadcasters, sponsors and European
football in general."</TE>
<TE>   The "burnout" factor that was obvious among some European teams
taking part in the 2002 World Cup was another reason behind the
changes, which are intended to reduce the number of games top players
must play.</TE>
<TE>   The UEFA leaders said they would address changes in the
continent's second major club competition, the UEFA Cup, at a meeting
in December.</TE>
<TE>   Zico to Coach Japan</TE>
<TE>   Former Brazilian World Cup striker Zico accepted an offer to
become coach of Japan's national team, replacing Frenchman Philippe
Troussier, who coached the Japanese into the second round of the
recent World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Zico, 49, has been playing and coaching in Japan since 1991, when
he joined the Kashima Antlers of the J-League.</TE>
<TE>   "I always said the last thing I wanted to do was be a football
coach," Zico said in Rio de Janeiro, "but in life you can never say
never."</TE>
<TE>   He will take charge of Japan's team July 20 and begin preparing it
for an Aug. 22 friendly against China in Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   Italian Supercup in Libya</TE>
<TE>   The Italian Supercup, the traditional curtain-raiser to the new
season, will be played not in Italy but in the Libyan capital of
Tripoli.</TE>
<TE>   Both teams, Serie A champion Juventus and Italian Cup winner
Parma, agreed to play the Aug. 25 game in the North African country,
whose state-owned Foreign Investment Company owns 7.5% of Juventus.</TE>
<TE>   The only other time the Italian Supercup was played outside Italy
was in 1993, when Washington played host to the game.</TE>
<TE>   Yallop to Coach MLS All-Stars</TE>
<TE>   Frank Yallop, coach of the defending Major League Soccer champion
San Jose Earthquakes, was named coach of the MLS All-Star team that
will play the U.S. national team in the league's All-Star game Aug. 3
at RFK Stadium in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre Raids Mexico</TE>
<TE>   Former Mexico national team coach Javier "Vasco" Aguirre, who
stepped down after the World Cup to take charge of the Spanish club
Osasuna of Pamplona, has lured a couple of his former players to
Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Ochoa of Monterrey and Manuel Vidrio of Pachuca are
expected to join Osasuna for the start of the new season Sept. 15.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Mexican striker Cuauhtemoc Blanco remains in limbo, no
longer on loan to Valladolid of Spain but unable to come to a
contract agreement with Club America of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Blanco reportedly is asking Club America, which owns his rights,
for $2 million a year to play for the Mexico City-based team.</TE>
<TE>   Inamoto's New Address</TE>
<TE>   Japan national team striker Junichi Inamoto, who languished on the
bench at Arsenal of the English Premier League but burst into the
spotlight by scoring two goals at the World Cup, has been traded to
another London club, Fulham.</TE>

<HD>Defending Champion Merrick Begins Play</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Yoon</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Merrick may be feeling deja vu entering the Southern California
Golf Assn. Amateur Championship, but he hopes to be feeling even more
after the tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Merrick, who will be a junior at UCLA in the fall, is the
defending champion of the SCGA Amateur, which takes place today
through Sunday at El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana. Last year, he
won the tournament at La Jolla Country Club a week after he won the
Long Beach City Championship.</LD>
<LD>   Merrick repeated at Long Beach on Tuesday and looks to complete
the double-double beginning today when the first 36 holes are played.
Should he win on Sunday, he would become the sixth repeat champion in
the 103-year-old tournament and first since Craig Steinberg of Van
Nuys in 1991-92.</LD>
<TE>   Steinberg has a chance to make history of his own. With four SCGA
Amateur titles to his credit, another would place Steinberg with Paul
Hunter as the only five-time winners. Eddie Heinen of Las Vegas, who
won the California Amateur championship, is vying to become the first
player since Johnny Dawson in 1942 to hold both titles
simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   Travis Johnson of Bellflower, who was runner-up at the SCGA
Amateur last year, has victories this summer at the Pasadena City,
Camarillo City and Public Links Golf Assn. of Southern California
events, but he had to withdraw from the tournament because he has not
fully recovered from an emergency appendectomy. Greg Puga, the 2000
U.S. Mid-Amateur Champion, also withdrew because of a scheduling
conflict with the U.S. Amateur Public Links Championship, which
begins Monday in Michigan.</TE>

<HD>Sparks Tussle, Then Lose</HD>
<DH>WNBA: Byears and Marciniak ejected for fighting and Cooper
runs onto floor in Storm's 79-60 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The Seattle Storm and Sparks did something rarely seen in the
WNBA--they fought.</LD>
<LD>   With 9:51 left in the Storm's 79-60 win Thursday, Michelle
Marciniak of the Storm and the Sparks' Latasha Byears were ejected.</LD>
<LD>   Byears was dribbling on a fastbreak when Marciniak fouled her.
After Byears tossed the ball from close range off Marciniak's face,
Marciniak came at Byears with her hands up before Byears shoved her
to the ground.</LD>
<TE>   Spark Coach Michael Cooper, who already had a technical for
arguing about the physical play, charged onto the court. He was not
ejected.</TE>
<TE>   The incident followed a play in which Sparks' star Lisa Leslie and
the Storm's Lauren Jackson battled for a rebound and Leslie elbowed
Jackson in the chest. No foul was called.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it takes a play like that for L.A. to know they're not
going to intimidate us on our court," Marciniak said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson scored 21 points and made three of Seattle's
franchise-best 13 three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time in my three years here that we got our
[behinds] just totally kicked, and it don't feel good," Cooper said.
"But now we know what all the other teams have felt like that we've
done this to."</TE>
<TE>   Leslie had 21 points, nine rebounds and six blocked shots for the
Sparks (14-3), who lost for the second time in four games. Mwadi
Mabika scored 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   "We play them again. I feel bad for them," Leslie said.</TE>
<TE>   It was a much better finish for Jackson than the last time the
teams played in Seattle. She scored in the opponent's basket in an
80-68 Sparks' victory June 18.</TE>
<TE>   "Playing like we did showed us we have a lot of talent and we can
play with anyone," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle rookie Sue Bird, caught yawning before the game after a
late-night flight back from the ESPY Awards in Los Angeles, had 13
points and five assists, and helped the Storm (9-10) take an early
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Bird won an ESPY award Wednesday for top college female athlete.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks averaged a league-leading 80.8 points in their previous
five games but were held 19 points below their season average.</TE>
<TE>   Reserve Felicia Ragland scored 19, making five of six three-point
shots for Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   The Storm made 66.7% of its shots in the first nine minutes and
42.3% for the game. It made 52% from three-point range.</TE>
<TE>   "They were hot," Leslie said. "If [Storm Coach] Lin Dunn had
subbed in she probably would have hit a basket, that's how good they
were."</TE>
<TE>   Leslie missed five of her first six shots, including an airball
from close range.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle built its biggest lead, 40-22, on a three-pointer by
Ragland with 3:48 left. The Storm made nine three-pointers in the
first half and led, 45-23, at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   "This game really proved to us and the WNBA that we can really
play," said Dunn, who believes Seattle still has a good chance to
make the playoffs as one of the Western Conference's top four teams.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks committed 19 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other WNBA games, Gordana Grubin made a three-pointer with 40.7
seconds left, helping the Phoenix Mercury beat the Houston Comets,
58-52, before 8,495 fans at Phoenix. The Comets' winning streak ended
at 10 games.... Lady Grooms made a layup off an inbounds play with
6.5 seconds left, and the Sacramento Monarchs ended an eight-game
losing streak by beating the Cleveland Rockers, 71-69, before a crowd
of 8,551 at Sacramento.</TE>

<HD>Armstrong Staying the Course</HD>
<DH>Cycling: Estonian Kirsipuu overcomes windy conditions and
avoids crash to win 121.1-mile stage as American maintains grip on
third place.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE DeSIMONE</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>ROUEN, France</DL>
<LD>Estonian champion Jaan Kirsipuu said he began the Tour de France with
slightly shaky legs.</LD>
<LD>   Kirsipuu's season was interrupted in March when he was knocked off
his bike and injured his knee in a training accident. He was lucky it
wasn't worse. A car cut in front of him as he was flying downhill at
close to 40 mph. He came back in May and has raced sparingly since.</LD>
<LD>   The Tour is not an ideal comeback event, but Kirsipuu appears to
have mended. He was part of a five-man breakaway that took off at the
68-mile mark of Thursday's 121.1-mile stage and persevered to throw
his wheel over the line first in this historic cathedral city.</LD>
<TE>   The overall standings remained the same as the pack finished 33
seconds behind Kirsipuu and his closest pursuers. Once's Igor
Gonzalez de Galdeano of Spain leads teammate Joseba Beloki by four
seconds and defending champion Lance Armstrong by seven seconds.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Postal riders kept Armstrong near the front of the pack, out
of harm's way, and chased down early breakaways.</TE>
<TE>   It was the third career Tour stage win for Kirsipuu, 32, who is
101st in the overall standings, 4 minutes 24 seconds off the lead.
"This was an unaccustomed effort for me," Kirsipuu said. "I'm just
going day by day for now.</TE>
<TE>   "This stage win is at least as important as the others, because it
gives me confidence. I was able to pull it out at the very end. As a
sprinter, I'm still not at my best. My strength is coming back....
When I finished seventh in Stage 3, and was among the best in the
team time trial, I saw I could do better."</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Kirsipuu was the only man other than Armstrong to wear
the leader's yellow jersey. Armstrong won the prologue time trial,
ceded the lead to the Estonian in Stage 1 and took it back
permanently six days later in a time trial ending in Metz.</TE>
<TE>   Kirsipuu has been with AG2R-Prevoyance, the same second-tier
French team for 10 years--an eternity in cycling. "There's a good
spirit on our team," he said of the squad, among the last invited by
Tour organizers. "I haven't seen better conditions anywhere else."</TE>
<TE>   All 189 riders started Stage 5, but it would be the last time the
pack was at full strength. Belgian Tom Steels, who has struggled with
the lingering effects of mononucleosis, dropped out at the 56-mile
mark. Then, 15.5 miles from the end of the stage, 20 riders went down
in a classic early Tour pile-up caused by nothing more than an errant
wheel on a windy day.</TE>
<TE>   Italian Marco Pinotti of the Mapei team, who briefly lost
consciousness, was taken to a local hospital for observation. He
broke his nose and bled profusely, but initial scans showed no other
fractures or neurological implications.</TE>
<TE>   Several other riders were banged up, but all managed to finish.</TE>

<HD>Fox Scores This One Err Bud</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As if Bud Selig didn't already have enough headaches, now Fox is
steamed at him.</LD>
<LD>   What has Fox fuming is not that he called Tuesday's All-Star game
with the score tied, 7-7; it's that he stiffed the network, walking
away from reporter Jeanne Zelasko without explaining his decision.</LD>
<LD>   Fox Sports President Ed Goren, still upset nearly 48 hours later,
said, "It was very unprofessional, the most unprofessional thing I've
ever seen from the head of a league."</LD>
<TE>   Michael Weisman, Fox's game producer, also was disgusted.</TE>
<TE>   "He owed an explanation to us, baseball's major rights holder," he
said, "but more importantly he owed an explanation to our audience,
to those at home who had invested four hours in watching the game."</TE>
<TE>   After the top of the 11th, Selig decided that the game would end
in a tie if the National League didn't score in the bottom half of
the inning. Managers Joe Torre and Bob Brenly had used all 60
players, including all 19 pitchers, and they didn't want to overuse
the pitchers who were on the mound at the time.</TE>
<TE>   With one out in the bottom of the 11th, the crowd in Milwaukee was
told the game would end at the end of the inning, but the fans were
left confused.</TE>
<TE>   Fox knew why the game was being called because both managers were
wearing microphones. So viewers at home knew too.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Fox sent Zelasko from the American League dugout to Selig
box's to get the official word.</TE>
<TE>   "I got there while Benito Santiago was still at bat," Zelasko
said.</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco Giant catcher struck out for the final out.</TE>
<TE>   Zelasko said she told Selig to stand by as Fox went to a
three-minute commercial break. Fox had two options--wait and do a
live interview or tape one and show it after the break. The decision
was made to wait and do a live interview.</TE>
<TE>   When fans began throwing trash and objects, Selig decided to take
cover, and told Zelasko, "We're going to the dugout."</TE>
<TE>   She followed him and kept him abreast as to how much time remained
before the break was over.</TE>
<TE>   "I was screaming at him that we were about to go on the air, but I
wasn't getting any response," Zelasko said.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the confusion, Fox went to another commercial break in the
hope that the commissioner would be more responsive when the network
came back on the air.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, as Zelasko was counting down, Selig talked to the
managers, then for unknown reasons went with them to the interview
room to meet with the print media.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't going to bum-rush the table and drag him away," Zelasko
said.</TE>
<TE>   What really bothered Zelasko, though, was that baseball's senior
vice president, Rich Levin, was quoted by the Washington Post the
next day as saying, "Fox could have been more aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   Zelasko said, "What was I to do, tackle him? I'm not a pit bull."</TE>
<TE>   Levin on Thursday explained what he meant.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a real chaotic situation," he said, "but if someone from
Fox had told me they had to have the commissioner, it would have been
done. He was focused on other things at the time, and so was I."</TE>
<TE>   Zelasko said Selig had to be aware of the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "I was by his side and talking to him the entire time," Zelasko
said.</TE>
<TE>   Offering an explanation to the live viewing audience should have
been Selig's top priority. He should have been able to figure that
out. But he blew it.</TE>
<TE>   Another Beef</TE>
<TE>   Goren also is upset that baseball allowed ESPN to televise the
postgame news conference with Selig and the managers.</TE>
<TE>   "That's illegal," he said. "No one can televise anything from the
game site until we've signed off."</TE>
<TE>   Said ESPN spokesperson Diane Lamb: "This was not game highlights
that we aired. It was a postgame press conference, which is breaking
news."</TE>
<TE>   Said Levin: "If Fox was still on the air, then ESPN was in
violation of broadcasting rules."</TE>
<TE>   Switching Gears</TE>
<TE>   NBC and TNT take over NASCAR coverage from Fox this weekend. One
new twist will be commentator Wally Dallenbach taking viewers on a
trip around the track during the pre-race show.</TE>
<TE>   Dallenbach and Benny Parsons will have a built-to-scale model car
in the booth to demonstrate what can go wrong with a car.</TE>
<TE>   Recommended Viewing</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods isn't playing golf again this weekend, but he is
featured on ABC's "British Open Preview" Sunday at 3 p.m. Woods
continues his pursuit of a true Grand Slam--winning all four major
championships in one calendar year--at the British Open next week.</TE>
<TE>   Woods has held all four titles but not in one calendar year.</TE>
<TE>   "Call it what you want," Woods tells Mike Tirico, "but I had all
four trophies on my mantle at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   There are several other segments on the show, including a look at
past British Open winners at Muirfield and Jim McKay's scrapbook of
British Open memories.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   After all the buildup, ESPN got only a 2.0 Nielsen rating for its
ESPY Awards show Wednesday night. In Los Angeles, where the show
started at 6 p.m., the live telecast got a 1.6, but the replay at 8
p.m. delivered a 1.5.... ESPN will televise the WNBA All-Star game
Monday at 4:30 p.m. The game is not expected to be called if it goes
into overtime.</TE>
<TE>   The Outdoor Life Network, which reaches about 60 million homes, is
providing daily coverage of the Tour de France, with highlights each
Sunday on CBS.... Lots of bull: The Professional Bull Riders
announced all 29 Bud Light Cup events will be televised next year on
the Outdoor Life Network.</TE>
<TE>   Channel 5 will carry two St. Louis Ram exhibition games--Aug. 10
against Tennessee and Aug. 19 against Kansas City.... Sporting News
Radio has announced that Bill Parcells has signed for two more years
to host his weekly Thursday show with Will McDonough and Bruce
Murray. The show, carried by KMPC (1540) in Los Angeles, begins Sept.
5.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   Baseball and Selig have provided plenty of fodder for late-night
television.</TE>
<TE>   Besides having a Bud Selig top 10 list Wednesday night, there was
this in David Letterman's monologue: "Congratulations to George W.
Bush. Earlier today, the Supreme Court declared him the winner of the
All-Star game."</TE>
<TE>   From Jay Leno: "The reason they stopped the game in the 11th
inning is because most drug stores close at midnight and both sides
were out of steroids."</TE>

<HD>May, Walsh Prefer to Play on Foreign Sand</HD>
<DH>Volleyball: Bypassing U.S.-based AVP because of its
'restrictive' contracts, they thrive on international tour.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To see Misty May and Kerri Walsh play, you'll need to book a flight
to Klagenfurt, Austria.</LD>
<LD>   Or get a hotel room and rent a car in Osaka, Japan.</LD>
<LD>   May and Walsh are one of the top U.S. beach volleyball teams--if
not the top U.S. team--but they will not play in the U.S. this
season.</LD>
<TE>   They're young, they're dynamic and they know how to win, but
they're playing on the international tour because of what May and her
agent call a "restrictive" player contract that limits endorsement
opportunities for athletes who play in the domestic Assn. of
Volleyball Professionals.</TE>
<TE>   May and Walsh are the only top-notch U.S. players--men or
women--who did not sign with the AVP this season. They have dominated
the international tour, winning tournaments in Spain and Switzerland
before finishing fourth Saturday in Norway.</TE>
<TE>   "The AVP wanted the ability to take all the players and give the
rights to the [tour] sponsors without the players getting anything,"
said Tom McCarthy, May's agent. "Misty wants to [play], but at the
same time, you can't give the ship away. We can't give up all the
rights the athletes deserve."</TE>
<TE>   May and Walsh seem perfectly content to play on the Federation
Internationale de Volleyball tour, which has been the more stable
tour in recent years and offers more tournaments with bigger paydays.</TE>
<TE>   The FIVB also holds the keys to an important process, Olympic
qualifying. The only way to qualify for the 2004 Olympics is to earn
points in FIVB tournaments over an 18-month time period that will
begin early next year. Two teams will qualify from each nation.</TE>
<TE>   May called the AVP contract "limiting," and said, "We just want to
concentrate on the FIVB this year. All the teams you're going to play
[in the Olympics] are here."</TE>
<TE>   The AVP, on the other hand, has struggled, having declared
bankruptcy in November 1998 and only recently showing signs of growth
since Leonard Armato purchased the tour last year.</TE>
<TE>   Armato, formerly Shaquille O'Neal's agent, said it was important
for the AVP to defer to sponsors as it tries to restore the
high-flying success it experienced in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   AVP contracts allow players to sign endorsement deals as long as
they don't conflict with a tour sponsor during a tournament. For
example, if the AVP is sponsored by a soft drink company, players
cannot wear the logo of a different soft drink at tournaments.
Players are allowed to wear athletic apparel and sunglasses of their
choice at tournaments, even if they conflict with an AVP sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's critical we deliver ambush protection to sponsors to ensure
that they'll continue to invest in the future of our sport," Armato
said. "Unless there's a tour that can attract and keep sponsors, this
sport will die in this country."</TE>
<TE>   Armato also said sponsorship opportunities for U.S. players were
better if they played in the U.S., even if corporate dollars were
fewer in the sagging economy.</TE>
<TE>   "Without being on the AVP tour, there's no platform for [May and
Walsh] in this country," Armato said. "If they want to be nomads the
rest of their lives and travel from country to country, that's going
to be a dead end. They're going to be at a competitive disadvantage
from an athletic and marketing perspective."</TE>
<TE>   May has an endorsement deal with Oakley and had one with Speedo
until its parent company declared bankruptcy last year, McCarthy
said.</TE>
<TE>   May, who will be 25 on July 30, was a standout at Newport Harbor
High and became national player of the year at Long Beach State in
1997 and 1998. She played briefly for the U.S. indoor national team
but left for an immediately successful career on the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh, who will be 24 next month, is in only her second season of
pro beach volleyball. As a 6 foot 3 outside hitter at Stanford, she
became only the second four-time All-American in the NCAA. Walsh had
also been represented by McCarthy but no longer retains his services.</TE>
<TE>   There are more women's tournaments on the FIVB tour, 11, than in
the AVP, seven, and the prize money is better.</TE>
<TE>   May and Walsh split $45,000 after winning the first two FIVB
tournaments; the U.S. team of Holly McPeak and Elaine Youngs split
$31,900 after winning the first two AVP tournaments at Huntington and
Hermosa beaches.</TE>
<TE>   McPeak and Youngs, who also play on the FIVB, won last week's
tournament in Norway. They have won all four AVP tournaments with
ease, prompting concerns about a lack of depth in the AVP.</TE>
<TE>   McPeak, who used to be May's partner, said she doesn't understand
why May and Walsh don't play on the AVP.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important we have a strong tour out here," McPeak said. "We
want to be a united front, everybody in it together. I think the fans
would like to see [May and Walsh] out here. We'd have great rivalries
with each other."</TE>
<TE>   Until then, the only place the top U.S. teams will face each other
is on the FIVB tour.</TE>

<HD>Another Seattle Shutout</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joel Pineiro of the Seattle Mariners had never beaten the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays, so Thursday night's 4-0 victory at St. Petersburg, Fla.,
over the team with the worst record in the major leagues was
especially satisfying.</LD>
<LD>   "Knowing that I was 0-3 against these guys, I wanted some payback.
I wanted to come out here and show them that I can pitch," Pineiro
said after giving up six hits in eight innings and extending his
winning streak to six.</LD>
<LD>   The Devil Rays defeated Pineiro, 3-2, in Seattle on May 22 and
scored five third-inning runs to beat him at Tropicana Field six days
later.</LD>
<TE>   During his winning streak, the right-hander is 6-0 in six starts
with a 1.14 earned-run average, lowering his ERA for the season to
2.50--second in the American League behind Boston's Derek Lowe
(2.36).</TE>
<TE>   Pineiro (10-3), coming off a two-hit shutout of the Kansas City
Royals on July 3, allowed two runners past first, struck out four and
walked one. Shigetoshi Hasegawa threw a hitless ninth to finish
Seattle's 11th shutout.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners scored an unearned run in the first and Ruben Sierra
hit a two-run double off Joe Kennedy (5-8) in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   New York 7, Cleveland 4--Andy Pettitte pitched seven strong
innings as the Yankees won at Cleveland. Pettitte (3-3) didn't allow
an earned run as the AL East-leading Yankees won for the seventh time
in eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Rondell White homered in the fourth inning off C.C. Sabathia (6-8)
and Jorge Posada had two RBIs for the Yankees. The Indians scored
three runs in the ninth before Mariano Rivera got Omar Vizquel on a
grounder for his 22nd save in 24 tries.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 4, Baltimore 1--Mark Mulder pitched seven shutout innings
and improved to 10-5 for the Athletics, who won at Baltimore. Mulder
didn't allow a runner past second base and is 8-1 with a 2.08 ERA in
his last nine starts.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 10, Toronto 3--Manny Ramirez homered for the first time
since coming off the disabled list June 25 and the Red Sox won at
Toronto, posting their 11th consecutive victory over the Blue Jays.
Boston's John Burkett (8-3) won for the first time since June 4.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 4, Texas 3--Eric Milton struck out a season-high 10,
including six in a row in one stretch, for the host Twins.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 9, Detroit 2--Dan Wright scattered four hits over eight
innings and Kenny Lofton had three RBIs as the White Sox won at
Detroit.</TE>

<HD>Anderson: All-Star Fans Not Cheated</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>In his first All-Star appearance, Garret Anderson heard boos, all
around him. As Anderson stood in left field during the 11th inning of
Tuesday's All-Star game, with the crowd informed that the game was
about to end in a tie, fans booed and chanted, "Let them play!"</LD>
<LD>   While he said he understood that fans wanted to see the game end
in a victory, he disputed the notion that fans who paid $175 a ticket
were somehow cheated.</LD>
<LD>   "They saw a great game. They got their money's worth," Anderson
said. "Yeah, you'd like to see a winner, but nobody could tell you
who won last year's All-Star game. At least it wasn't a 0-0 game.
They saw Barry [Bonds] hit a home run. They saw [Curt] Schilling
pitch well. They got what they paid for."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With the Chicago Cubs and Cleveland Indians firing managers within
the past week and intending to rebuild, the Angels are aware that
such veteran relievers as Tom Gordon and Jeff Fassero (Cubs) and Paul
Shuey and Ricardo Rincon (Indians) could be traded soon. And, with
the Angels seeking a reliever and five days away from the first of 11
consecutive games against division rivals Seattle and Oakland, they
would love to see General Manager Bill Stoneman make a deal in the
next few days.</TE>
<TE>   "But a lot of times when you're looking for that one piece and one
club has it, 10 teams want it," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said. "I
think Bill is going to make sure he makes an equitable deal. I think
he'd rather take his time and make a good deal than rush and make a
poor deal."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although outfielder Darin Erstad said last week he is willing to
forgo free agency and sign a long-term contract extension with the
Angels now, his agent said Thursday he had neither solicited an offer
from Stoneman nor presented a proposal to him. Agent Jeff Moorad said
he spoke with Scioscia at the All-Star game and assured him Erstad
did not wish for his contract status to become an issue during the
pennant race.</TE>
<TE>   "Darin has made it clear his first choice is to remain in Anaheim
and his desire is to have a deal in place sooner rather than later,"
Moorad said. "Bill Stoneman and the organization were very clear in
spring training--as I was at that time--that we felt the best thing
to do was to put off the discussions until the end of the season.
That continues to be our intent."</TE>

<LD>Disturbingthepeace isn't the only hot horse running for owner David
Milch and trainer Darrell Vienna.</LD>
<LD>   Six days after Disturbingthepeace won his fourth in a row by
shocking Kona Gold and others in the $300,000 Triple Bend Breeders'
Cup Handicap, Crowning Point will try for his third consecutive win
in tonight's first race.</LD>
<LD>   Claimed for $16,000 on March 9 at Santa Anita by Milch, a
successful television producer-writer who lists "NYPD Blue" and "Hill
Street Blues" among his credits, Crowning Point needed a drop in
class before he went on a mini-roll.</LD>
<TE>   After finishing fourth in his first two starts for his new
connections, the 4-year-old Lil Tyler gelding prevailed by a neck
over favored Coke's Tribute when running for an $8,000 claiming price
on May 24. Returned 16 days later, the California-bred won by a neck
again, edging Fast 'N Nab at the $10,000 level.</TE>
<TE>   Worse than second only once in six starts at Hollywood Park,
Crowning Point stays at the same plateau and will break from the rail
again, just as he did in his June 9 victory. He is the 5-2 choice on
Russ Hudak's morning line.</TE>
<TE>   David Flores started riding the bay after he was claimed four
months ago and will be back on the horse tonight.</TE>
<TE>   In the second race, Desert Drama, a daughter of Bertrando owned
and bred by Pam and Marty Wygod and trained by Nick Canani, will make
her debut going a flat mile on the turf against eight other
California-bred fillies and mares.</TE>
<TE>   She's a half sister to Hoovergethekeys, a multiple-stakes winner
who scored an upset in a stakes at Pleasanton last Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fourth at Hollywood Park is a wide-open turf
affair for fillies and mares. There aren't many throwouts in the
field of 10.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Trainers Craig Lewis and Jeff Mullins. Lewis scored
Thursday with Hot Market in the third and Arbiter in the seventh, and
Mullins won the fourth with Primacy and the eighth with Sir
Bertrando.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Codger. The gelding, who has lost all but one of 33
starts, goes in tonight's fifth at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Expocito, Sample Copy and
Gaelic Hope in the fifth; Northern Blue, Fully Invested and I'm The
Business in the sixth; Excessive Angi and Avian in the seventh and
singling Brief Message in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/149. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $10/$847.20. Total money bet: $980.</TE>

<LD>Eight of the nine entrants in tonight's $13,000 Refrigerator Handicap
have something in common.</LD>
<LD>   Red Hot Speed, Let It Snow Cash, Debs Silver Shadow, HRH Royal
Princess, Willie Awesome, Dashing And Famous, I Spy A Fly and Im A
Pritzi Boy are all coming off victories entering the 350-yard
contest.</LD>
<LD>   Only Diamond On Her Mind was a recent loser. The 2-year-old
California-bred filly was fourth in her last appearance on June 7.</LD>
<TE>   Of the eight horses who have won their previous race, only two
have the distinction of being unbeaten. The first is I Spy A Fly, a
daughter of Strawfly Special who has won both of her races for owner
Double Bar S Ranch and trainer Chuck Treece. She was a prompt
favorite in both under jockey Joe Badilla Jr., who has the call again
this evening.</TE>
<TE>   The other is Dashing And Famous, a son of Dash Thru Traffic who
beat maidens by two lengths in his June 30 debut for owner Vinewood
Farms and trainer R C Howell.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Pritzi Ann. 2. Magical Nick. 3. Bronxville Doll. 4.
Dinastia Toll. 5. Be Bop Jaz. 6. Proof Im Hi. 7. Bdr Bug On The Dash.
8. Sables Dash. 9. Dashing And Famous. 10. Danes Degaulle.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Single Pritzi Ann in the first; use Mitzis Mercedes, Seldom
Lies and Magical Nick in the second; use Lovely Gay Shook, Bronxville
Doll and Ultimate Prize in the third and use Dinastia Toll and Loose
Fly in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Run Five Dashes is a firster in the sixth
debuting in a bad race for trainer Donna McArthur. Another Shooter,
who is in the wide-open 10th, had the excuse of breaking through the
gate before his last on June 20.</TE>

<HD>Dempster and Floyd Traded</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Insisting it's no fire sale, Marlins include them
in 11-player deal involving Expos, Reds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid Commissioner Bud Selig's latest doomsday forecasts, none of
which seemed quite as imminent Thursday as he had made them sound
Wednesday, two of baseball's most troubled teams--the Florida Marlins
and Montreal Expos--joined the Cincinnati Reds in a three-way trade
involving 11 players.</LD>
<LD>   The Marlins, by trading outfielder Cliff Floyd to Montreal and
pitcher Ryan Dempster to Cincinnati, seemed to revive memories of
former owner Wayne Huizenga's payroll and roster decimation of his
1997 World Series winner, but that may not be the case.</LD>
<LD>   The Expos, who recently acquired pitching ace Bartolo Colon from
the Cleveland Indians and remain in playoff contention, continued to
snub their uncertain future by including two legitimate pitching
prospects in a five-player package for Floyd, who is eligible for
free agency at the end of the season.</LD>
<TE>   This is the way it went down:</TE>
<TE>   The Marlins traded Dempster, their opening day pitcher the last
two years but an overall disappointment, to Cincinnati for outfielder
Juan Encarnacion, infielder Wilton Guerrero, minor league pitcher
Ryan Snare and cash.</TE>
<TE>   They then traded Floyd, Guerrero, pitching prospect Claudio Vargas
and slightly more than $1 million--requiring Selig's approval--to the
Expos for pitcher Carl Pavano, reliever Graeme Lloyd, utility man
Mike Mordecai and the two valued pitching prospects: Justin Wayne and
Don Levinski, whom sources said is the player to be named.</TE>
<TE>   With the cash exchange, the deal was a financial wash for the
Marlins and Expos.</TE>
<TE>   However, it was unlikely the Marlins were going to meet Floyd's
free-agent terms, they got out from under the remainder of his
$6.6-million salary this year and, in Encarnacion, 26, acquired a
potential long-term replacement who was having something of a
breakthrough season with 16 homers and 51 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Wayne was the Expos' No. 1 draft choice out of
Stanford in 2000, and Levinski was their second pick in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   It's a chance for Florida owner Jeffrey Loria to recoup an
investment he made as the Expos' owner.</TE>
<TE>   He gave Wayne a $2.95-million signing bonus and Levinski an
$850,000 bonus.</TE>
<TE>   With no stadium initiative and the lowest attendance south of
Montreal, the Marlins may go on to unload anyone and everyone (they
have had discussions with the Dodgers involving second baseman Luis
Castillo and pitcher Brad Penny with nothing imminent), but club
President David Samson said, "this is not a white flag by any
stretch."</TE>
<TE>   He added that the "definition of a fire sale is when you trade
players for the purpose of driving down your payroll, and that didn't
happen here.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, you make trades trying to get better for now and the
future, and I think we've done that."</TE>
<TE>   Floyd, who began his career in Montreal, returns with a .287
average, 18 homers and 57 RBIs. He didn't buy Samson's account,
saying his departure smacked of the initial step in a 2002
capitulation by a team on the fringe of the wild-card race in the
National League.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sorry situation," he said. "They're going to get everybody
aggravated and everybody will want out."</TE>
<TE>   The Expos, meantime, continue to put it all on the line this
year--not knowing if they'll be back in Montreal next year, relocated
to Washington or in the contraction scrap heap.</TE>
<TE>   Hanging tough in the NL's wild-card and East division races, they
gave up one of baseball's most highly regarded young shortstops
(Brandon Phillips) in the Colon deal, and two of their top three
pitching prospects for Floyd. But General Manager Omar Minaya called
Vargas a comparably talented pitching prospect and, in "all of our
trades, I've tried to make the team better this year and in the
future, as well. There may be some uncertainty, but I think people
had the wrong perception about what we could do [as a team operated
by the commissioner's office] and would do."</TE>
<TE>   The Reds, who began the second half only two games behind St.
Louis in the NL Central, have been operating with a recycled rotation
of Joey Hamilton, Jimmy Haynes, Elmer Dessens and Chris Reitsma.
Dempster, Florida's franchise leader with 42 wins, goes right to the
forefront, although he is 5-8 with a 4.79 earned-run average and
scouts keep waiting for him to fulfill his talent.</TE>
<TE>   "Although we had to give up Encarnacion and Guerrero, who have
contributed to our success, we couldn't pass an opportunity to get a
25-year-old pitcher who has the potential to be a No. 1 or No. 2
starter for years to come," said Cincinnati General Manager Jim
Bowden, who acknowledged that there is more of an urgency now for Ken
Griffey Jr. to get healthy and stay healthy but that the development
of young outfielders Adam Dunn and Austin Kearns made it a little
easier to trade Encarnacion.</TE>
<TE>   All three teams are gambling, as is any club trading before the
July 31 non-waiver deadline, that the second half won't be
interrupted by a work stoppage, but as Bowden said, "we're focused on
the race and think this improves our chances."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 11 players who changed uniforms, Lloyd, the veteran relief
pitcher, had to be the most bewildered.</TE>
<TE>   He rejoins an owner whom he accused of having "lied to me more
than once" when Loria owned the Expos.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Lloyd's contract listed 12 teams to which he could
not be traded, including the Marlins. However, the covenant was not
renewed by the required date, a technical failure that Expo officials
said was the fault of agent Ron Shapiro, and they didn't hesitate
including him in the trade, a shock to the unhappy pitcher.</TE>

<HD>McNeal Is a Natural for Westwood</HD>
<DH>High schools: The Gardena Serra safety is hoping to make a
big impact at UCLA, the school he's long loved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eric McNeal downplays his choice to attend UCLA even though he's been
a lifelong Bruin fan and his parents attended the school.</LD>
<LD>   "I wouldn't say it was because my mom and dad went there," McNeal
said as he prepared for the Shrine Football All-Star Classic on
Saturday. "That really didn't matter. It was up to me. You want to go
to the place that's best for you."</LD>
<LD>   Scott Altenberg, his high school coach at Gardena Serra, says
McNeal was destined to go to Westwood.</LD>
<TE>   "He has wanted to play at UCLA his whole life," Altenberg said
with a laugh. "Last year, they were doing really well and then they
lost to Stanford. When I saw him [at school] on Monday, he looked
like his puppy had got run over. He just loves that school."</TE>
<TE>   McNeal figures to start at safety for the South team as the Shrine
game returns to a North-South format after seven years in which
all-star teams from California and Texas played against each other.</TE>
<TE>   At 6 feet 3 and 200 pounds, McNeal was a coveted recruit. Many
coaches from across the country were impressed with videotapes that
showed the second-team all-state performer make crunching hits or use
his 4.45 speed to return interceptions for touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, about 50 college coaches came by in May," Altenberg
said. "They would look at highlight tapes that I put together. Eric
was just ridiculous in them. He would return an interception 90 yards
on one play then throw the ball 65 yards on the next play.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone who saw it said, 'We'd like to offer him a scholarship.'
"</TE>
<TE>   UCLA defensive coordinator Phil Snow was one of those who was
impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "He showed on tape that he really hits you," Snow said. "He has
good athleticism. He has a knack for getting in there and delivering
a big hit."</TE>
<TE>   McNeal's choice was made easier when he realized that UCLA's
starting safeties, Marques Anderson and Jason Stephens, completed
their eligibility last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to go somewhere where there are two starting
players returning and they've got a redshirt freshman waiting,"
McNeal said. "I'm not saying that I didn't want to compete with
everybody. You just want a chance to compete."</TE>
<TE>   Snow said McNeal will get that and possibly more. A former
defensive coordinator at Arizona State before coming to UCLA last
year, Snow envisions the safety fitting in the mold of a hybrid
safety/linebacker position that future NFL starters Pat Tillman and
Adam Archuleta flourished in for the Sun Devils. Both were selected
as defensive player of the year in the Pacific 10 Conference.</TE>
<TE>   "He's almost 6-4 now and he's still growing," Snow said. "I told
Eric when I recruited him that if he got any bigger, he might have to
play linebacker. We're going to give him an opportunity to play."</TE>
<TE>   Altenberg said McNeal shouldn't have a problem at any position
UCLA wants him to play. At Serra, he played for three years at
quarterback and defensive back, spent time at wide receiver and also
returned punts and kickoffs.</TE>
<TE>   In a 38-17 victory over West Hills Chaminade last season, McNeal
returned an interception 54 yards for a touchdown, had a 43-yard punt
return for a score and added a one-yard touchdown run. Serra's
football season was cut short with an upset loss to Pomona in the
first round of the Southern Section Division VII playoffs, but McNeal
started at guard on the basketball team and helped lead it to the
Division IV-A championship game against Verbum Dei.</TE>
<TE>   "He just loves to play," Altenberg said. "I found that I had to
find ways to slow him down. He literally wanted to play all the
time."</TE>

<HD>Williams' Daughter Seeks Aid From Bushes, Glenn</HD>
<DH>Cryonics: President, former president and former astronaut
don't take sides in controversy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The controversy over baseball great Ted Williams' body heightened
Thursday when his oldest daughter requested intervention from
President Bush, his former president father and former astronaut John
Glenn, who served in the Marines with Williams during the Korean War.</LD>
<LD>   Williams died a week ago.</LD>
<LD>   Bobby-Jo Ferrell, Williams' daughter, said attorneys are expected
to appear in a Florida court, possibly today but no later than
Monday, to argue that Williams' frozen body should be removed from
Alcor Life Extension Foundation, a cryonics laboratory in Scottsdale,
Ariz. She said Williams' will stipulates that his body is to be
cremated and his ashes scattered in the waters of the Florida Keys,
where he once fished with former president George Bush.</LD>
<TE>   Ferrell alleges her father's body was ordered moved to Alcor by
her half-brother, John Henry Williams, for possible financial gain.</TE>
<TE>   "John Glenn appreciated my daddy being his wingman [in the Korean
War]," Ferrell said in a letter sent to media outlets. "I want John
Glenn to come forward now and come to his friend's aid. President
Bush and his father need to come forward and 'work in this campaign'
for your old friend--like he worked for you."</TE>
<TE>   In a prepared statement, former Sen. Glenn (D-Ohio) said, "In my
visits and conversations with my friend, Ted Williams, we discussed
his recovery and living. We had no conversations regarding his wishes
for the handling of his remains. Ted Williams, above all else, loved
his family, and they loved him as well.</TE>
<TE>   "I am confident the bonds of family will guide them to a
resolution of this very painful issue."</TE>
<TE>   A White House spokesman said President Bush had made no statement
regarding Ferrell's request. A spokesman for former president George
Bush said he was not available for an interview Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   John Henry Williams, 33, has not spoken publicly since his
father's death, but Ryan Richeal, director of Florida operations for
the Boston Red Sox, said he'd had a five-minute conversation with
John Henry on Thursday. John Henry was playing for the Red Sox's
rookie-level minor league team in Fort Myers, Fla., when his father
died. He is recovering from a broken rib suffered in his second game.</TE>
<TE>   "[John Henry] just said over and over how it's a shame how this
has happened this way," Richeal said. "He told me he went to
Milwaukee for the All-Star game [Tuesday], but it became obvious when
he got there that there was going to be a negative cloud over the
night if he showed up for his dad's ceremony. So he didn't go [to
Miller Park]."</TE>
<TE>   Richeal said he hadn't asked John Henry about his reaction to the
controversy, why he wanted his father's body kept at Alcor, or when
he might be willing to discuss the subject.</TE>
<TE>   Sherri Mosley, Williams' granddaughter and Ferrell's daughter,
said the contents of Ted Williams' will "have put the momentum in our
corner," regardless of potential involvement by the Bush family or
Glenn.</TE>
<TE>   "The next thing we have to address is how we're going to get my
grandfather's body out of that warehouse [Alcor]," Mosley said.
"Freezing a body is one thing. Thawing it out is another. I don't
know what to expect."</TE>

<HD>Artist's Canvas Is 5 Miles of Concrete</HD>
<DH>Freeways: Waves, birds and dolphins decorate a stretch of
the 710 in a first for L.A. County.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is the largest piece of artwork ever displayed in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   But mosaic artist Kerry Zarders' name is nowhere to be seen on the
five-mile-long exhibit being dedicated today by state and local
officials.</LD>
<LD>   Stylized waves, dolphins, pelicans and schools of fish created by
Zarders have been placed on both sides of a new freeway median
divider on the Long Beach Freeway between the San Diego Freeway and
Pacific Coast Highway.</LD>
<TE>   Transportation administrators say it is the first drive-by art of
its type in Los Angeles County. And make no mistake about it:
Sandblasted into concrete, it's a permanent exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I'm not going to sign my name to it," Zarders said, laughing
Thursday afternoon as she showed daughter Sophie, 7, the finished
work for the first time. "It would look like graffiti. And Caltrans
would come by and paint it out right away."</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans officials commissioned the artwork as a way of sprucing
up the hard-working Long Beach Freeway, which is heavily used by
tourists and by trucks carrying cargo containers from the nearby
port. Traffic engineers are spending $16.7 million to rehabilitate a
2 1/2 mile stretch of the 710 Freeway south of its intersection with
the 405 Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Zarders, 45, of Long Beach was recruited by Caltrans through the
Public Corporation for the Arts in Long Beach, which has worked with
her on local bus-stop beautification projects.</TE>
<TE>   The nautical motif came about after officials rejected an earlier
proposal by Zarders for an automotive theme.</TE>
<TE>   "I came up with silhouettes that would represent cars that used
this freeway when it first opened in 1952. I had a 1949 Cadillac, a
1950 DeSoto convertible and a 1949 MG-TD sports car. But they said
no. There was no way they were going to put any more cars on this
freeway."</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans officials say motorists caught in traffic along the
roadway that carries 160,000 vehicles a day would probably not
appreciate glancing out the window at cars that looked as if they'd
been stuck on the 710 for 60 years.</TE>
<TE>   Zarders was paid a $1,600 honorarium for her work by the public
arts corporation, said Susan Gray, an administrator with the group.
The state spent $200,000 to hire Angeles Steel Co. of Santa Fe
Springs to make steel templates, and Western Sandblasting of Santa
Ana to emboss the 213 images in the concrete and stain them blue.</TE>
<TE>   Today's 10 a.m. dedication ceremony at Cesar Chavez Park Community
Center, 401 Golden Ave., Long Beach, will be presided over by Maria
Contreras-Sweet, secretary of the California Business, Transportation
and Housing Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say favorable reaction by motorists could prompt the
commissioning of more center-divider artwork. In the future, art
pieces might be molded in place as the median concrete is poured.</TE>
<TE>   As for Zarders, she is prepared for the day when skids and scrapes
mar her art.</TE>
<TE>   "That's OK. There will be tire marks and diesel grime. But that's
the function of freeway medians: to keep trucks and cars from jumping
to the other side," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "So this is functional art."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Gang Member Gets Political Asylum</HD>
<DH>Immigration: The case of a deported Salvadoran native
turned peace activist in L.A. was linked to the Rampart Division
police scandal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORA ZAMICHOW</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gang member turned peace activist Alex Sanchez has been granted
political asylum, ending a case that was complicated by overtones of
the LAPD Rampart Division scandal.</LD>
<LD>   "It has great significance because we have been allowed to keep a
great peacekeeper," said Silvia Beltran, executive director of Homies
Unidos, an anti-gang program.</LD>
<LD>   "It's wonderful news," said former state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Los
Angeles), who befriended Sanchez five years ago and testified on his
behalf. "He's helped a lot of young people stay out of trouble and
out of harm."</LD>
<TE>   Sanchez, now 30, was deported in 1994 to his homeland, El
Salvador, because of a decade-old auto-theft conviction and a
subsequent parole violation for possessing a firearm. A year later,
he returned illegally to the U.S. and eventually helped form the
local chapter of Homies Unidos.</TE>
<TE>   Police critics turned Sanchez's case into a cause celebre, saying
it was an example of how the Rampart Division tried to run roughshod
over problematic witnesses by having them deported to prevent their
testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez had planned to testify on behalf of a teenager arrested by
Rampart officers on suspicion of murder.</TE>
<TE>   In requesting political asylum for Sanchez, his attorney, Alan
Diamante, argued that his client might be killed if he was returned
to El Salvador because of his links to the Salvadoran gang Mara
Salatrucha and his stance against police corruption.</TE>
<TE>   The police chief of San Salvador, Hayden, three anthropologists, a
photojournalist and a psychologist were among the witnesses who
testified on behalf of Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Sanchez's conviction for firearm possession was
vacated. Two years ago, his felony conviction for auto theft was set
aside. With both felony offenses tossed out, the path was cleared for
the immigration judge to grant political asylum, Diamante said.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling Wednesday by Immigration Judge Rose Peters means that
Sanchez will now be able to apply for U.S. citizenship, Diamante
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It has totally changed my life," Sanchez said. "It's a new
beginning for me. Now I don't have to run anymore. It's a good
feeling."</TE>

<HD>Ex-LAPD Officer Faces Extortion Sentencing</HD>

<LD>A judge on Thursday ordered a 90-day state prison evaluation of a
former LAPD motorcycle officer before deciding how to sentence him in
an extortion plot to which he pleaded no contest.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Wesley said he needed more
information about Melvin Leon Boyd, 38, before deciding whether Boyd
should receive probation or prison time for his part in the May 2001
crime.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors sought a three-year prison term. Boyd's lawyer, who
argued for a lighter sentence because of his client's record as a
public servant, asked for a year in jail and probation.</LD>
<TE>   Boyd is one of six people who have pleaded no contest to charges
stemming from the scheme. Prosecutors say Boyd posed as a detective
while another man told a Lakewood real estate broker he was being
investigated for ties to organized crime.</TE>
<TE>   They demanded $1 million, threatening to arrest the man if he did
not pay, prosecutors said. The broker gave them $2,700 and a Rolex
watch and agreed to subsequent meetings to pay the rest.</TE>
<TE>   The other defendants got sentences ranging from time served to
three years in prison, said Deputy Dist. Atty Max Huntsman.</TE>
<TE>   Huntsman argued that Boyd should be punished more severely because
he was a law enforcement officer. "He used his badge to try to get
... a heck of a lot of personal gain," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd's attorney, Bradley Brunon, told the judge that his client
had been lured into the plot by a friend who had told Boyd that they
were going to collect a debt.</TE>
<TE>   The judge, however, said he believed Boyd had been an active
participant. He added that he was not inclined to grant Boyd
probation.</TE>

<HD>Latino Parents Often Lack College-Entry Savvy</HD>
<DH>Study: Parental language barriers and a lack of information
are keeping some youths off campus, says research from the Tomas
Rivera Institute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Making sense of the college admissions scramble--SAT, early decision,
financial aid forms--is enough to frustrate any parent.</LD>
<LD>   But that challenge is compounded when parents don't speak English
or when their child is the first in the family to attend college, as
is the case with many Latinos, according to a study released Thursday
by the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute's Center for Latino Educational
Excellence.</LD>
<LD>   About two-thirds of 1,000 Latino parents surveyed in Los Angeles,
New York City and Chicago failed a test about the college admissions
process sponsored by the Claremont-based institute. That lack of
knowledge means lower college acceptance and graduation rates, said
researchers, who have urged schools to start providing
college-preparation information in middle school and to hire more
bilingual counselors.</LD>
<TE>   To pass the eight-question test, parents had to know, among other
things, that community colleges do not offer bachelor's degrees, that
legal residents who are not citizens can receive financial aid and
that the SAT--not the GRE--is required for many undergraduate college
admissions.</TE>
<TE>   Although the majority incorrectly answered at least half of the
questions, about 96% of the parents surveyed still expected their
children to go to college or a university.</TE>
<TE>   "This drives a dagger through that stereotype that Latino parents
aren't interested in their kids going to college," said Harry P.
Pachon, president of the institute, which is affiliated with the
Claremont Graduate University and the University of Texas. "But
between that aspiration and the actuality of Latinos attending
college, there's quite a big gap."</TE>
<TE>   Families' lack of knowledge about admissions means fewer students
qualify to attend college.</TE>
<TE>   About 24% of Latino high school graduates have taken courses that
the University of California and Cal State University systems
require, Pachon said.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, nearly 60% of Asian students make themselves eligible
for admission by taking the right classes, along with 28% of black
graduates and 41% of white graduates, according to state statistics.</TE>
<TE>   The study did not include parents of other ethnic groups for
comparisons because of a lack of institute resources, officials said.
But a senior researcher, Lou Tornatzky, said that Latinos who speak
English fluently and have household incomes of more than $35,000
scored at least twice as high as those who spoke only Spanish and
whose families earn less.</TE>
<TE>   Some students who don't have information about scholarships and
financial aid are discouraged from attending even if they are
accepted, Pachon said.</TE>
<TE>   The study's implications go beyond the Latino community, he said.
"How can we stay competitive as a state when the majority of our
population is being channeled into limited-education jobs?"</TE>
<TE>   The results highlight the need for schools to work harder to
provide information, said a Los Angeles Unified School District board
member, Jose Huizar, at a presentation of the study Thursday in
downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now it's pretty random," he said. "Many of our Latinos who
go on to college are only there because they happened to talk to that
special teacher or counselor who inspired them."</TE>
<TE>   Middle schools should provide information about the college
admissions process and required college preparatory classes, and high
schools should hire more bilingual guidance counselors, Pachon said.</TE>
<TE>   Colleges should offer guidance beyond tours and brochures about
their own campuses, said Louis Caldera, a vice chancellor in the Cal
State system. The system started this year to distribute fliers in
Spanish and English that list ways parents can prepare their children
for college.</TE>

<HD>Pact Reached for Irvine Teachers</HD>
<DH>Contract: Tentative agreement would give minimum 2.5%
raises for this fiscal year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ending months of impasse and bitter exchanges, the financially
troubled Irvine Unified School District and its teachers union have
reached a tentative contract agreement, officials announced Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Under the agreement, all teachers will get at least a 2.5% salary
increase this fiscal year and at least 1.8% next July 1.</LD>
<LD>   Individual raises can be higher, and will vary depending on
qualifications and experience. Irvine's mid-career teachers generally
will receive the higher rates, district officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the best we could do," said Anne Caenn, president of the
Irvine Teachers Assn. "It has been a very difficult and contentious
negotiation."</TE>
<TE>   The typically tense process was made more difficult this year
because of the state's budget crisis and Irvine Unified's own
projected deficit of more than $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The district argued that it simply didn't have enough money for
raises sought by teachers. Rising costs for health benefits and the
current economic outlook put a financial pinch on the 24,000-student
district, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But the union accused the district of manipulating financial
figures. Talks broke down this spring and the parties went into
mediation for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "Our teachers' morale has never been lower," Caenn said. "I do
believe [the district is] underfunded.... But it is a matter of
allocation [of money], not ability to fund. They did not make us a
priority."</TE>
<TE>   The teachers, who had been without a contract for a year, will
receive no retroactive raises for the 2001-02 school year, a sticking
point during negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement, which was reached Tuesday, must be ratified by the
Board of Education and the union's 1,100 members when they return in
September. Caenn said teachers and administrators will have to work
at mending fences in the meantime.</TE>
<TE>   District officials said they were able to pay for the raises by
switching to a cheaper health insurance carrier.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Long, deputy superintendent of human resources, said health
coverage won't be affected and may improve in some cases.</TE>
<TE>   "We do have extraordinary teachers," Long said. And the salary and
benefits are "designed to recognize their dedication and commitment."</TE>

<HD>Cypress Suing to Block Initiative</HD>
<DH>Development: At stake is church property that officials
want to sell to a retailer. Ballot measure seeks to reverse city's
condemnation of land.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cypress city officials have filed suit in Superior Court to throw out
a ballot initiative aimed at reversing a city decision that condemned
land owned by a church so a Costco or other "big box" retailer can be
built.</LD>
<LD>   The city redevelopment agency voted in May to toss Cottonwood
Christian Center off 18 acres at the intersection of Walker Street
and Katella Avenue, where it had planned to build a "mega-church" for
its 4,000 members. That prompted a group called Citizens for Property
Rights to launch a petition drive to bring the matter before voters.</LD>
<LD>   The group presented the city with more than 4,000 signatures,
typically enough to force a public vote on a city matter.</LD>
<TE>   But Cypress officials say redevelopment agency actions are exempt
from such ballot initiatives and cannot be overturned by a popular
vote.</TE>
<TE>   "We would be denigrating the entire referendum process by putting
this on the ballot," City Atty. William Wynder said. "We would just
get into trouble with the courts."</TE>
<TE>   Church supporters call the city's lawsuit an affront to democracy.</TE>
<TE>   "It is outrageous that the city will take the opinion of thousands
of voters and kick it to the curb," said Scott Aanonson, spokesman
for the citizens group. "I'm not sure what the city is afraid of.
They must be afraid they are going to lose this vote."</TE>
<TE>   He disputes the city's claim that putting the issue on the ballot
would be illegal. "The courts haven't made a decision on this kind of
initiative in the past," he said. "There is no legal precedent for
this."</TE>
<TE>   Cottonwood bought the land in 1999 with the intention of building
a 300,000-square-foot church with day-care facilities, a youth
center, gymnasium, bookstore and coffee shop. But city officials say
the land is in a redevelopment zone where they have long envisioned a
sales tax-generating commercial center. The city has been in
negotiations with Costco to sell the land to the company once it is
in city hands.</TE>
<TE>   In challenging the ballot measure, city officials also said the
petition failed to include the complete text of the resolution the
citizens group is seeking to overturn. Aanonson blamed that on the
city, saying that it took days for officials to produce it and the
time frame in which signatures could be collected was limited. City
officials say they delivered copies of the resolution in a reasonable
time.</TE>

<HD>3 Women Settle With Dole Over Accident on Muddy Road</HD>
<DH>Lawsuit: Company says it was not liable for the crash that
left one victim permanently disabled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three Oxnard women have settled a lawsuit against Dole Food Co.,
which they alleged was at fault for a February 2000 single-car
accident that left one of them permanently disabled.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement should give farmers and companies an incentive to
clean up the roadways after they are done harvesting in nearby
fields, said F. Samuel Heredia, an attorney for the women.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we've done a good job of making sure the roads are safer,
especially in the rural areas," Heredia said.</LD>
<TE>   Shortly after midnight Feb. 10, 2000, the vehicle in which the
women were riding slid on a muddy section of Pleasant Valley Road in
Oxnard, rolled into a ditch and landed on its roof.</TE>
<TE>   Adela Gutierrez, 56, Maria Melgoza, 51, and Estella Franco, 37,
alleged in their suit that Dole and its subsidiaries had failed to
adequately clear the road of mud after harvesting celery nearby.</TE>
<TE>   All three women suffered serious injuries. Gutierrez was in a coma
for three weeks and is permanently disabled; Melgoza was in a coma
for three days and suffered a ruptured spleen and a fractured wrist;
and Franco suffered facial fractures and had to have reconstructive
surgery, Heredia said. Only Melgoza has been able to return to work,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   None of the women, who were on their way home from work, was
wearing a seat belt, according to the police report. The driver,
Guillermo Sanchez Medellin, a co-worker, had an expired driver's
license and was found to be operating the car at an unsafe speed for
the road conditions. He was hospitalized for minor pain but was not a
plaintiff in the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Clifford Schaffer, an attorney for Dole, declined to address
specific allegations in the suit but said Dole was not liable for the
crash.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement terms were not disclosed, but Heredia said the
women would be able to take care of their medical bills for life.
They total nearly $200,000 so far, he said.</TE>

<HD>Shards Found at Playground</HD>
<DH>Safety: School discovery has Huntington Beach police
considering a copycat scenario.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A copycat may be to blame for glass shards found this week at a
Huntington Beach school playground, police said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Several large pieces of glass were found Tuesday buried in sand at
the private Pegasus School on Lexington Lane. Although they did not
rule out the possibility of an accident, police said the glass
appeared to have been placed intentionally.</LD>
<LD>   The discovery is similar to other incidents in which sharp objects
were found at several South County parks and playgrounds in the
spring. Those incidents ended after authorities on June 4 arrested a
21-year-old Mission Viejo woman, Lori Fischer, on suspicion of
planting razor blades and nails around playground equipment.</LD>
<TE>   "This is unexpected," said Laura S. Hathaway, founder and head of
Pegasus School. "I thought that this problem was over."</TE>
<TE>   The school, for preschoolers through eighth-graders, is in a
residential tract between a cul-de-sac and public park. About 200
students are enrolled in summer classes.</TE>
<TE>   Hathaway said a student spotted one piece of brown glass Tuesday
morning and reported it to a teacher's assistant. School officials
searched the playground and turned up more shards, each 3 to 4 inches
long, around a jungle gym. Hathaway said school officials also found
part of a beer bottle, suggesting casual littering by a passerby, but
said the fragments appeared to have been deliberately placed in the
sand.</TE>
<TE>   The pieces were then discarded. Police were not notified until
Wednesday. School officials also mailed hundreds of letters to
parents, informing them.</TE>
<TE>   Police have warned other schools to inspect their playgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they will expand routine helicopter patrols to include
parks and schools, and heat-sensitive infrared imaging will help them
spot any perpetrators.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be aggressively investigating every incident we see in the
parks or the school grounds," said Lt. Lloyd Edwards, patrol watch
commander for Huntington Beach police. Investigators said the latest
incident could be the work of a copycat.</TE>
<TE>   "You have someone who for some reason wants to deliberately hurt
young kids in the school grounds or park areas using sharp objects,"
said Lt. Ron Burgess. "We're hoping someone knows ... who did this
and can provide us with more information."</TE>

<HD>Dispute Delays Cleanup of Contaminated Waste in Oxnard</HD>
<DH>Wetlands: Smelting plant officials and environmentalists
are at odds over removal of Ormond Beach wells.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Removal of contaminated waste at an Oxnard smelting plant has been
delayed as plant officials and environmentalists squabble over the
best way to begin cleaning up the mess without harming nearby
wetlands.</LD>
<LD>   Halaco Engineering Co. failed this week to obtain city permission
to use a dirt road jointly owned by the Metropolitan Water District
and Oxnard's Community Development Commission, an Oxnard business
leader said.</LD>
<LD>   City officials declined to comment on a closed meeting Tuesday
regarding Halaco's request.</LD>
<TE>   Halaco's operators sought use of the road for access to aging
wells that must be removed as part of a state-ordered cleanup of
contaminated water from a slag heap on the Ormond Beach site.</TE>
<TE>   But environmentalists had urged the City Council to reject
Halaco's request, saying large trucks on the road would harm the very
wetlands the state is trying to protect.</TE>
<TE>   City Council discussion of the permit ended Tuesday evening
without a vote, said Steve Kinney, president of the Greater Oxnard
Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The road sought for access bisects much of the protected wetlands,
prompting an angry response from environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   "You should take actions against [Halaco's] illegal encroachment
on the wetlands instead of partnering with the company," Damon Wing,
programs director of the environmental group Ventura CoastKeeper,
told the council members at an earlier meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Halaco officials said they are trying to comply with orders from
the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board, which has
required the company to replace inoperable water-monitoring wells
with new equipment to help stem daily discharges of soupy waste
produced by the plant.</TE>
<TE>   In March, the water quality board directed Halaco to stop the
discharges that have been flowing since 1970, yielding a 40-foot-high
slag heap near the wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   The discharges, which amount to half a million gallons of
contaminated water each month, must end by December. The slag heap
must be removed within 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Removal of the old wells should have been started earlier, said
Dave Gable, one of Halaco's owners.</TE>
<TE>   Gable said Halaco needs access to the city's 15-foot-wide road--an
extension of McWane Boulevard--so it can reach contaminated areas on
the eastern portion of the plant.</TE>
<TE>   The plant's internal roads cannot accommodate the large trucks
needed to haul away the dismantled wells and bring new equipment to
the site, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Halaco's next step is not clear, company officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not been informed of anything," Halaco's attorney, Arthur
Fine, said. "We have no permit yet, but we still need access," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists said Halaco is not being creative enough.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to see why they need trucks," said Drew Bohan, executive
director of Santa Barbara ChannelKeeper. "We're not talking about
big, old-fashioned wells. They could be removed manually."</TE>
<TE>   Bohan and others said Halaco has already done enough environmental
damage by allowing its slag heap to seep into the sensitive wetlands.
Halaco officials said the company has not harmed the wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   Gable said an industrial drill could not be carried in without a
truck. And Fine said removal of the wells would have required only a
handful of trips by one truck over four months.</TE>
<TE>   The company is seeking access to the road for well removal, Fine
said. Removal of the slag heap has not been addressed yet.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no building, digging, paving. They're just running a
truck with rubber tires over dirt," Fine said.</TE>
<TE>   Gable said a preliminary road permit issued by the Metropolitan
Water District in May was stalled after environmentalists learned of
the company's request.</TE>
<TE>   He added that Halaco has used the road informally for many years.</TE>

<HD>County to Insure Poor Children</HD>
<DH>Health: Officials reserve $100 million in tobacco taxes for
care of infants and preschoolers. The services will become available
in six months.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County officials have set aside $100 million in tobacco
taxes to provide health insurance to babies and preschoolers from
low-income families over the next five years, an ambitious effort to
cover gaps in other government health care programs.</LD>
<LD>   The Children and Families First Proposition 10 Commission--which
administers cigarette tax proceeds created by that
initiative--approved the insurance plan Thursday, but said it will
take about six months before it becomes available.</LD>
<LD>   "We're making a very big statement about our priorities," said Zev
Yaroslavsky, who as chairman of the county Board of Supervisors also
heads the commission. When the program is in place, he said, every
child under 6 will have access to medical care in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   The program, called Healthy Kids, will provide outpatient,
hospital, vision, dental, prescription and mental health coverage for
a premium of $4 to $6 a month per child under 6 years of age. There
will also be "modest" co-payments for emergency room visits,
prescription medication and other non-preventive services. The
details of how the plan will be delivered--whether through an HMO or
a patchwork of private physicians--have yet to be worked out.</TE>
<TE>   The program will serve a narrow swath of children, primarily those
from working poor and undocumented immigrant families who do not
qualify for programs such as Medi-Cal or Healthy Families because of
their income or legal status. Together, those two federal and state
programs help primarily legal residents whose income does not exceed
250% of the federal poverty level, or about $45,000 a year for a
family of four.</TE>
<TE>   Healthy Kids will help children whose families earn up to 300% of
the federal poverty level, or about $54,000 a year for a family of
four. It will accept children regardless of their legal status. The
commission estimates that 15,000 county youngsters will qualify.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they also hope their outreach effort will help
enroll children in other government programs. They estimate that 80%
of the county's uninsured children under 6 qualify for subsidized
health care but have not signed up.</TE>
<TE>   Four other California counties, including San Francisco, have
started similar plans.</TE>
<TE>   Health care advocates said they were pleased that the commission
will help the very young stay healthy, but they worry about
school-age children and adults who can't afford health care.</TE>
<TE>   "You can only bite off a piece at a time, and it's an excellent
piece for them to start off with," said Cass Ben-Levi, head of
community and government relations for the Community Clinic Assn. of
Los Angeles County. "It's just such a small piece, and such a large
problem."</TE>
<TE>   She and others expressed concern about the availability of
doctors, given the Board of Supervisors' decision last month to close
11 public health clinics, reduce by 25% subsidies to private clinics
that treat the uninsured and end inpatient services at High Desert
Hospital, an effort to begin to deal with a looming $800-million
deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to have a network for kids, and if you close the clinics
and close the hospitals, that's not going to happen," Lynn Kersey, of
Maternal and Child Health Access, told the commission Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, actor Rob Reiner, who led the successful campaign to
hike cigarette taxes to fund programs for California children, asked
the county panel to use some of its roughly $160 million annual
allocation to fund health and preschool programs countywide.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Reiner said if the county implements his idea for
universal preschool, it would also create an opportunity to sign up
those children for health care programs.</TE>
<TE>   The commission, which has the sole authority to spend money
allocated to the county for programs that benefit children under 6,
approved the preschool idea in theory last month, but is studying how
such an ambitious plan would work. Officials expect to vote on a plan
in August.</TE>

Police Department officers from several divisions combed the Van Nuys

every stripe. Task force officers made 48 arrests for DUIs,
outstanding warrants and narcotics violations and issued more than

<HD>Activists Silent on Beating</HD>

<LD>As is often the case, Najee Ali was the first speaker and most
familiar face Tuesday at the demonstration outside Inglewood City
Hall.</LD>
<LD>   He popped a few veins over the videotaped altercation between cops
and 16-year-old Donovan Jackson, stepped aside for a while, and then
returned to tell everyone that New York Reverend Al Sharpton was on
his way to town for a march and rally.</LD>
<LD>   This announcement was met with approval from the 100 or so
demonstrators, but for me it was a sorry sign. L.A. is a major league
city. As I wrote Wednesday, we shouldn't have to count on Al
Sharpton, of all people, to lead any of us anywhere.</LD>
<TE>   So the next day, I met with the ubiquitous Ali, of Project Islamic
Hope, to ask what gives.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a crisis in black leadership in Los Angeles," he said
without hesitation. "They're more concerned with making money, and a
lot of the time, our so-called black leaders are poverty pimps."</TE>
<TE>   Ali had borrowed the phrase from former Los Angeles Mayor Dick
Riordan. But what exactly did he mean by it? I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no real concern for the welfare of the people. There's
not a way for them to profit off of this or they'd be involved. I
haven't been contacted by any other black leader or group except for
Rev. Al Sharpton."</TE>
<TE>   He did add that the Rev. Jesse Jackson, another outsider, called
Donovan Jackson's family.</TE>
<TE>   "You juxtapose this with Bernard Parks," Ali said, referring to
the recent ouster of the LAPD police chief, "and every major black
leader busted the barricades to be heard. Now we've got a child
beaten on videotape, and no one's moved an inch."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of Parks, the guy lives five minutes from Inglewood and
wants to enter politics, and he's got nothing to say?</TE>
<TE>   Ali, 38, ends up being L.A.'s face of black leadership "by
default," to use his own words.</TE>
<TE>   "In New York, I'd be one of a handful. But the elders here are not
grooming young leaders, and all the black elected officials are old
people ... who care more about driving their Mercedes and having a
house in Baldwin Hills or Ladera."</TE>
<TE>   Ali, a former gangster with the Crips, and an ex-con who got
religion in prison, lives in Baldwin Hills himself and Project
Islamic Hope is funded in part with grants. So I asked what
distinguishes him from the so-called poverty pimps.</TE>
<TE>   "I fight for social justice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among those Ali criticized by name were L.A. County Supervisor
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke and Congresswoman Maxine Waters, both of whom
represent Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   I called their offices for a response.</TE>
<TE>   Burke's secretary, who had been out of the office for several
days, said that if Burke hadn't said anything, it's probably because
she wasn't asked.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes my job is just too easy.</TE>
<TE>   The secretary later called back to say that in fact, Burke
"stepped up to the plate" with a motion to investigate the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "Stepped up to the plate" and whiffed, if you ask me. I'm being
generous in guessing it took Burke roughly five minutes to assemble
her motion, which misstates the facts and adds nothing to the
discussion.</TE>
<TE>   Waters was on the phone to me from Washington, D.C., about two
minutes after I called her office, and she was not happy.</TE>
<TE>   She refused to criticize Ali, but said that in addition to working
on homeland security and helping wage the fight against corporate
crime, she's been on national television and radio speaking out about
the Inglewood incident.</TE>
<TE>   She said she's also been "in constant communication" with
Inglewood Mayor Roosevelt Dorn and the lawyer for Jackson's father,
and she sent U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft a letter calling for an
investigation that has now begun.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm doing enough, don't you?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   I felt as though I'd stepped into the middle of a feud between Ali
and Waters, so I called longtime activist and author Earl Ofari
Hutchinson to referee.</TE>
<TE>   "I see merit on both sides," Hutchinson said. Ali is right about a
vacuum in black leadership, he went on, but Waters shouldn't be
lumped in with the do-nothings.</TE>
<TE>   So who should be? The list is long, said Hutchinson.</TE>
<TE>   The NAACP, church leaders, the Urban League, the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, black professional groups. When
black leaders do speak out in L.A., Hutchinson said, it's often
because Ali is raising a ruckus on the street, forcing them to.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. doesn't need a Sharpton or any other outsider who's going to
vanish "when the cameras are gone," Hutchinson said. It needs more
local folks with courage and conviction.</TE>
<TE>   There was only one person left to call--KABC radio talk show host
Larry Elder.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a crisis of black leadership," agreed Elder, a black
libertarian perpetually at odds with L.A.'s black political class,
but it's got nothing to do with "yelling and screaming" when a
16-year-old gets punched by a cop who later says the kid grabbed him
where it hurts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about the appalling performance of our inner-city public
schools, where three out of four kids can't read, write and compute
at grade-level. But the Democratic Party and Maxine Waters and all
these people are in bed with the teachers unions and resist every
sort of change, including vouchers."</TE>
<TE>   "Where are they on black-on-black crime?" Elder asked. "Murder has
gone up three consecutive years in this city, including in Maxine
Waters' district.... A quarter of young black men have criminal
records, 70% of black children are born out of wedlock.... Where are
black leaders on that stuff?"</TE>
<TE>   Talk about grabbing people where it hurts.</TE>

<HD>26 Miles Across the Sea, Santa Catalina Is the Place for
Wacky Tourists to Be</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's that time of the year, when the tourists descend on Catalina,
dressed in their funny clothes and asking their funny questions. "My
favorite is, 'Do the buffalo migrate?' " said Sherri Cline of the
Landing Bar &amp; Grill in Avalon. "We tell them, 'Yes, they swim across
the channel [to L.A.].' " Cline said the island, which is a part of
L.A. County ( not a sovereign nation), draws such wacky queries as:</LD>
<LD>   "Where do I go to have my currency changed?"</LD>
<LD>   "Is the water in the bay saltwater?"</LD>
<TE>   "What freeway exit do I take to get to Catalina?"</TE>
<TE>   And: "What time does the 4 o'clock boat leave?"</TE>
<TE>   Catalina (part II): Then there are the unusual observations by
tourists. Cline once saw a visitor point to San Clemente and tell his
child it was China. And the smoke from an incinerator used to draw
attention in the old days. "People would say it was a live volcano,"
Cline recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Second lives: Mention of a Straw Hat Pizza becoming a Raw Hat
Pizza inspired readers to recall other cases where signs had been
recycled for new businesses. "I played at Pike's Verdugo Oaks in
Glendale in 1980-81," musician Gary Myers wrote. "When it was sold,
it became Mike's Verdugo Oaks."</TE>
<TE>   Then there was Little Annie Fannie's, a South Gate joint that
became Little Annie Wannie's for reasons that weren't completely
clear. Eric Sandberg of Diamond Bar recalled a Comfort Inn in
Monterey Park that "got buzz-sawed into the Come On Inn." And Deb
Chandler of Upland remembered "a Lamp Post Pizza that became Lamp Pot
Pizza. What is a lamp pot?"</TE>
<TE>   Accountable: Steve Kile of Downey noticed a phrase on a marquee
that was either a movie title or a room for patrons who show up at
the theater without any money (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Thanks for the warning! For $2 million-plus you'd think a house
would have a bit of warmth, style and grace. But not the one spotted
by William and Lisa Dalmatoff of La Mirada (see accompanying). Guess
it's really a seller's market.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of warmth: In Arkansas, Fred Booth came upon a church
marquee that promised some spiritual cooling (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: The California Sumo Assn., which wrestles weekly at
the John Wooden Center at UCLA, has members weighing as little as 105
pounds. Observed the L.A. Business Journal: "It figures that in L.A.
even sumo wrestling is for the thin."</TE>

<HD>There's No Excusing Such Stupidity, No Bringing Xavier Back</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He's out there somewhere--not a dangerous predator, but a criminal
nonetheless.</LD>
<LD>   If he won't turn himself in (don't hold your breath), someone
needs to do it for him. He may well not have had malicious intent
when he pulled the trigger on the Fourth of July, but even if that's
true, what's the punishment for criminal stupidity?</LD>
<LD>   I'm posing the question on Thursday afternoon, about the same time
as they're burying 9-year-old Xavier Morales in Cypress. Whoever is
responsible for the boy's death remains at large. We can only hope
his conscience haunts him.</LD>
<TE>   Young Xavier went to Boisseranc Park in Buena Park to watch
fireworks on Independence Day. Police say a bullet struck him on his
right side, puncturing a lung and severing the aorta. He died the
next day in a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Now, a week later, police don't seem to be closer to finding out
who fired the shot, although they hope a $10,000 reward will smoke
someone out. Some in the Buena Park Police Department still are
cursing the Fates and the unknown gunman, leaving Sgt. Rich Pena to
wonder aloud on Thursday: "Whatever happened to sensitivity toward
children and humanity?"</TE>
<TE>   I'm glad he wasn't asking me for an answer.</TE>
<TE>   How to explain why a bullet that police say was fired into the air
found its way into Xavier's body? How to explain why instead of
merely injuring him, it killed him?</TE>
<TE>   Since there are no reassuring answers, we're left to rail at
someone who thought that firing a gun in the city--even into the
air--was fun. It's no longer a defense for people to say they don't
know of the consequences--there have been plenty of warnings over the
years that even stray bullets come down eventually.</TE>
<TE>   Police theorize the shooter probably was firing in conjunction
with the Fourth of July celebration. A real patriot, no doubt, and
what better way to show love of country than to fire a shot or two
into the night sky?</TE>
<TE>   Neither anger nor sarcasm will bring Xavier back. If it would, I
could summon extra doses of both. Maddeningly, neither would a
lengthy prison sentence for the shooter, assuming he's found. Such
recklessness demands punishment, but what's the appropriate sentence
for such indifference and ignorance?</TE>
<TE>   Pena says the case probably would warrant manslaughter charges,
and possibly something more serious depending on the circumstances.
Although police say the bullet probably was fired into the air, Pena
says it could have been fired from a lower angle.</TE>
<TE>   Those kind of investigative nuts and bolts seem almost trivial
compared with the loss of life.</TE>
<TE>   "What bothers me," Pena says, "is this young boy was there to
celebrate the nation's birthday, and he died. I have 20 volunteers
behind me, and we're going out there in the hot sun and pass out
fliers on it [to try to find the shooter]. We all care. He was a
child of the world, and he's no longer here."</TE>
<TE>   Cops can't afford to get caught up in the tragedies they see. If
they did, they'd all be in therapy. Still, Pena says, Xavier's death
has been tough--partly for unexpected, poignant reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Such as when Xavier's 17-year-old brother, Arturo, came up to
Pena. "He hugs me and says thanks for all your work, and I feel like
I haven't done anything," Pena says. "He thanks everyone, shakes
everybody's hands. If that's a reflection of what [Xavier] would have
been like, look at what we're missing."</TE>
<TE>   That commendation only makes me angrier. Mindless crime can lead
to a lifetime of what-ifs about the victims it claims, not to mention
the hurt it leaves behind in the families and friends.</TE>
<TE>   I went out to Boisseranc Park this week, and on that midweek
afternoon, a bunch of kids were playing in the park. Two young teens
were shooting hoops, and nearby two younger boys were idling the time
on the playground equipment.</TE>
<TE>   One of the two younger boys, Fonze Romero, says he comes to the
park almost every day in the summer.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to skate and play basketball," he says. He'd heard about
young Xavier's death, but says the park is safe and that he isn't
afraid to hang out there.</TE>
<TE>   We talk for a few minutes and I'm struck by how hip the boy seems,
how full of life and energy.</TE>
<TE>   I ask his age, and Fonze says he's 9.</TE>
<TE>   The same age as Xavier Morales, another boy unmindful of any real
danger from a great day in the park.</TE>

<HD>Perot Says Company Didn't Profit From State Power Market</HD>
<DH>Utilities: He denies that firm used inside knowledge to
exploit weaknesses in system.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Billionaire Texan H. Ross Perot defended his company Thursday against
charges that it tried to profit from inside knowledge of California's
electricity market.</LD>
<LD>   Flanked by lawyers and faced with a clot of cameras unusual for a
Capitol hearing, the former presidential candidate caused a stir with
his appearance but not his testimony before a state Senate committee.</LD>
<LD>   "He doesn't seem to have any more knowledge now than he did a
month ago," said Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), chairman of the panel
that for more than a year has been investigating the collapse of
California's electricity market.</LD>
<TE>   Perot agreed last month to come to Sacramento after Dunn's
committee discovered that Perot Systems Corp., of which Perot is
founder and chairman, offered to teach energy companies how to take
advantage of loopholes in California's deregulated market.</TE>
<TE>   In his trademark twang, the 72-year-old technology tycoon
testified that after five weeks of investigating, he has concluded
that the company did nothing wrong. Perot Systems, based in Plano,
Texas, did not gain confidential information as a consultant on a
$57-million contract to help set up California's power market, he
said, and had nothing to do with the soaring prices and blackouts
that plagued that market in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Perot cautioned senators against giving a nefarious taint to the
company's sales pitch on "gaming" the California market.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you're trading," said Perot, "if it's horses, cattle,
corn, cotton, you name it, stocks, cellular phone frequencies and now
electrical power, you have buyers and sellers who are engaged in the
trading process, and they all used advanced computer technology to do
that."</TE>
<TE>   "If there's something inherently wrong with discussing gaming
theory, then several Nobel prizes need to be returned," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Perot argued that Perot Systems employees never possessed
confidential information about the rules governing operation of the
California Independent System Operator, which manages most of the
state's transmission grid, and the Power Exchange, the now-defunct
electricity marketplace. Starting in March 1997, Perot Systems was
hired to set up and test software for Cal-ISO and the Power Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Perot Systems employee Paul Gribik teamed up
with George Backus and his Colorado-based company, Policy Assessment
Corp., and made pitches to several companies about helping them
maximize profits in the California market.</TE>
<TE>   None of the companies approached--including Southern California
Edison, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and Enron Corp.--hired Perot Systems
for such help.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1997, Cal-ISO officials raised concerns about Perot
Systems trying to profit from knowledge of the market's potential
weaknesses. Cal-ISO Executive Director Jeffrey D. Tranen called Perot
Systems' behavior "a flagrant violation of basic norms of business
ethics and indicative of bad-faith dealing," but Cal-ISO did not
terminate the company's contract.</TE>
<TE>   In the hearing Thursday, Senate special counsel Laurence Drivon
used Perot Systems' own documents to argue that the company marketed
itself as having privileged information.</TE>
<TE>   He quoted a July 1997 letter to the unregulated trading arm of
PG&amp;E in which Backus wrote: "Our combined efforts with the Perot
Systems' (PSC) staff working on the ISO ... have shown a large number
of additional gaming opportunities that their unique experience with
the [power system] interface allow."</TE>
<TE>   In the same letter, Backus wrote: "Gaming may be a dirty word to
[federal regulators] and the California commission, but the sooner
the market clears out the distortions, the better it works for
everyone.... There may be ethical issues related to 'the end
justifying the means' but there is a large region of opportunities
between what is ethically viable (profitable) and ethically dangerous
(illegal)."</TE>
<TE>   "It would appear that Perot has exhibited itself to various market
participants as having inside capabilities, knowledge and expertise,"
Sen. Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside) said to Perot. "Was that mere
puffing?"</TE>
<TE>   "The only way either you or I can get to the bottom of that
question is to talk to the people who wrote those memos," said Perot,
who emphasized that Backus did not work for Perot Systems.</TE>
<TE>   Backus did not appear Thursday because he said he could not afford
an airplane flight to California. The Senate and Perot Systems
refused to pay his fare.</TE>
<TE>   During the hearing, Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) jokingly
passed to fellow lawmakers a can marked "George Backus Airline Ticket
Collection."</TE>
<TE>   Gribik, who left Perot Systems in January 2001, testified that he
never advised anyone on how to illegally or unethically exploit
California's electricity market. In fact, he said, he pointed out
potential problems that Cal-ISO and the Power Exchange fixed before
the market opened.</TE>
<TE>   Gribik said he considered Backus something of a blowhard who
"overstated things frequently."</TE>
<TE>   "I, too, am a California resident and have paid more for my
electricity and suffered the same inconveniences that other
California residents have encountered," Gribik said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Perot Systems closed Thursday at $10.58, up 35 cents.
But the stock had been trading close to $20 before disclosures by
Dunn's committee.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Partner of Plaintiff on Pledge Goes Public</HD>
<DH>Courts: A defense fund is established to protect the
reputations of the woman and her child.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The anonymous 8-year-old girl in the shadow of last month's court
ruling on the Pledge of Allegiance was pulled deeper into the
tug-of-war over God and politics Thursday when a Washington law firm
set up a fund to defend her and her mother's reputations.</LD>
<LD>   In a lawsuit filed by the child's father on her behalf, a panel of
judges ruled that the phrase "under God" is an improper reference to
religion. But the second-grader is a churchgoing Christian, not an
atheist, the law firm said, and is a tool of her father Michael
Newdow's campaign to maintain a strict division between government
and religion.</LD>
<LD>   The girl and her mother, Sandra Banning--Newdow's former
partner--"believe that America is in fact 'one nation under God,' "
said their attorney, Paul E. Sullivan, who plans no legal action but
will represent his clients' interests in the continuing debate. "It
is important that the child is not unjustly linked in the public's
mind or in official court records to this case or the negative
attention it has received."</LD>
<TE>   Sullivan's firm, Foley &amp; Lardner, did not say how the girl's
reputation has been harmed by her connection to the case. Both Newdow
and the Elk Grove School District where she is a student have taken
pains to protect her identity.</TE>
<TE>   Newdow, a lawyer and former emergency room physician, has
acknowledged from the beginning that the girl says the pledge each
morning with her classmates. Newdow has said he does not press his
religious beliefs on her and that the case has always been about him,
not her.</TE>
<TE>   When the media descended on his house after the U.S. 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals' ruling, Newdow removed the girl's photographs from
his refrigerator and walls so her face would not appear in news
accounts.</TE>
<TE>   He predicted long ago that much of the nation would find his
beliefs radical. And, to spare her the notoriety, he intentionally
left his daughter's name off the documents he filed in court as part
of his case so that she could not be identified.</TE>
<TE>   "I have consistently refused to discuss her (except to state that
she is an absolutely super kid and that she got all 'excellents' on
her last report card)," Newdow wrote in an e-mail Thursday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "I continue to maintain--as I have from the beginning--that the
[Constitution] protects my right, as a parent, to send my daughter to
public school without her being indoctrinated with any particular
religious belief, even one with which we might agree.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the thrust of this case as it pertains to my child, and
it does not require any further involvement on her part."</TE>
<TE>   Foley &amp; Lardner, which has a staff of nearly 1,000 attorneys in 16
markets, has long-standing ties to conservative politics. Sullivan,
for example, has provided legal assistance in the past to former
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and Strom Thurmond, the South
Carolina senator and conservative icon. Foley &amp; Lardner was loosely
affiliated with President Bush's campaign during the recount of the
2000 election.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan said attorneys from the firm were already working the
phones to solicit donations to Banning's legal defense fund--and were
hoping that members of Congress would be first in line. He said
solicitations would go out to people of every stripe, and he declined
to discuss his politics in an interview Thursday, saying that he
hopes to keep this issue removed from the political arena.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers said the firm's links to conservative groups are
evidence that Republicans are trying to seize the Pledge of
Allegiance issue as their own.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, reaction to the 9th Circuit's ruling--which was stayed
the next day and which most analysts believe will be reversed--has
been bipartisan. The Senate voted 99-0 to condemn the ruling.
Democrats such as Sen. John Edwards were "just as quick" to condemn
the decision as Republicans such as Sen. Trent Lott, said Steve
Benen, spokesman for the Washington-based nonprofit Americans United
for Separation of Church and State.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, there have been suggestions that Republicans hope
to make the Pledge of Allegiance "their" issue. GOP strategist Ralph
Reed and talk radio commentator Rush Limbaugh have said the decision
will mobilize the Republican base.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a concerted effort to exploit this controversy for
political gain," said Benen, whose organization supported the 9th
Circuit's ruling but is not formally involved in the case. "It does
not surprise me. But it is nevertheless disappointing."</TE>
<TE>   Newdow and Banning never married. Newdow says they remained best
friends even after splitting up, until a family law court drove a
wedge between them.</TE>
<TE>   They share custody of their daughter. When Banning has her for the
weekend, the girl attends church and Sunday school. When it is
Newdow's turn for a weekend, she does not attend church, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the criticism, Sullivan said he and others are not trying
to politicize the debate.</TE>
<TE>   Banning said it was necessary to obtain legal representation for
herself and the girl. Regardless of Newdow's efforts to protect the
girl, Banning said she feared the public would conclude that her
daughter is an atheist and has somehow been "harmed" by reciting the
Pledge of Allegiance.</TE>
<TE>   "In her discussions with me, she expressed sadness about the
decision. I assured her that this was a long process and there were
many steps before the pledge would be changed and the words 'under
God' removed," Banning said in a prepared statement Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Hearing this, she told me that it was OK because she will still
whisper 'one nation under God' and no one will hear her and know she
is breaking the law. Because of her response and the potential impact
of this case on her life, I have the responsibility as her mother to
speak out, to set the record straight or clear up any
misrepresentations."</TE>
<TE>   Elk Grove Unified School District Supt. David W. Gordon, a staunch
critic of the 9th Circuit ruling, said he supported Banning's
decision to obtain legal representation.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon is working with his attorneys--and with state and federal
government lawyers--to appeal the 9th Circuit's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a family matter," he said. "If she chooses to do it,
that's her choice.... I certainly wouldn't criticize her for it."</TE>
<TE>   Newdow disagreed, saying he is "deeply disappointed" that the girl
has been folded into the controversy more than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "I will continue to do what I can to keep her out," he said. "I
will not discuss her beliefs, except to say that children look to
their parents to figure out what the world is about, and that any
parent can get any young child to believe anything."</TE>

<HD>State Appeals Court Overturns Man's Conviction in 1981
Triple Murder Case</HD>
<DH>Ruling: Judges say the prosecution left out information
about a key witness' criminal history. Now after years in prison, the
defendant could be freed or retried.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TED ROHRLICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state appeals court has overturned a conviction in a 1981 Pasadena
triple murder, concluding that prosecutors should have uncovered
information about a key witness that could have undermined his
credibility and led to an acquittal.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling came in the case of Anthony Stacy, who was convicted by
a Los Angeles County jury of shooting to death a man, a pregnant
woman and her viable fetus during a robbery of a drug house.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling, centering on the background of witness Charles E.
Jones, a veteran police informant, calls for Stacy to be either freed
or retried.</LD>
<TE>   Jane Robison, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office,
which prosecuted the case, said her office had not yet seen the
appellate court ruling and would have no comment.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had only two key witnesses at Stacy's 1983 trial. One
was an alleged accomplice who said he helped plan the robbery and was
in the house during the killings. He was given immunity for his
testimony. The second was Jones, a jailhouse informant who said Stacy
repeatedly confessed the killings to him while they were in adjoining
cells. Jones, who was himself being held on a murder charge,
testified that he came forward out of outrage because he could not
stomach the killing of a pregnant woman.</TE>
<TE>   A three-judge panel of the state Court of Appeal ruled unanimously
Wednesday that prosecutors should have unearthed and disclosed to
Stacy's defense attorney more information about Jones' lengthy
criminal record. Jones had frequently cut deals with police and
prosecutors in Kentucky for leniency for a number of his own crimes.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office had obtained for itself and
disclosed to the defense a slim California rap sheet for Jones that
contained only a vague reference to his criminal record in Kentucky,
rather than a full FBI report.</TE>
<TE>   It was not until 1996, after Stacy had been behind bars for more
than a decade, that an attorney appointed by the court to represent
Stacy's interests dug into Jones' Kentucky past and found dozens of
criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney, Robert Berke, said he flew to Kentucky and met
Jones, who was once again in prison. According to Berke, Jones
admitted that he had lied at Stacy's trial and that he had come
forward, not as a good citizen, but in the hope of winning greater
leniency than he had already been promised for cooperating against a
co-defendant in his own murder case. The appeals court said he had
been promised to be allowed to plead guilty to voluntary
manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   A Kentucky police detective also told Berke he had used Jones in
15 to 30 cases in the 1970s and provided him with leniency. But the
detective said that in 1978, after learning that Jones had provided
him with false information, he stopped using him as an informant.</TE>
<TE>   The Court of Appeal decision, written by Justice J. Gary Hastings
and concurred with by Justices Daniel Curry and Norman Epstein, said
that if jurors had known Jones' full background, they "may have
totally disregarded his testimony."</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution then would have been left to rely on a mainly
uncorroborated account by Stacy's alleged accomplice, James Dean.
Dean testified under a grant of immunity that Stacy accidentally shot
him in the leg during the robbery and that he then hobbled out of a
room where Stacy held victims Leroy Kelly and Debra Jones at
gunpoint. He said he then heard shots.</TE>
<TE>   There were inconsistencies in Dean's account. For example, he said
he lent Stacy his .22-caliber revolver that day and never got it
back. But other confederates testified that Dean retained and later
sold the gun.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office initially sought the death penalty
for Stacy. But jurors who found him guilty of murders with special
circumstances decided instead that he should serve life in prison
without the possibility of parole.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Superior Court Judge Patricia Collins dismissed the
special circumstances, making Stacy eligible for parole. She said
prosecutors had an obligation to dig into their informant's past and
share it with the defense. But she found that even if the informant's
credibility had been compromised, enough evidence remained from Dean
and others to hold Stacy responsible for participating in the
robbery-murders.</TE>
<TE>   This week's decision evaluated the possible outcome differently.
Justice Hastings wrote that jurors "may have found that the remaining
corroborative evidence was insufficient to overcome any doubts it may
have had regarding Dean's credibility and concluded there was
reasonable doubt whether Stacy was present at the scene of the
crimes."</TE>

<HD>Study Finds No Threat to Surfers</HD>
<DH>Health: Sponsors sought evidence against ocean dumping of
sewage but say too few were tested.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A limited health study of Huntington Beach surfers completed this
week shows no evidence that frequent ocean users have a greater risk
of contracting hepatitis A, a virus that can flourish in polluted
waters.</LD>
<LD>   Aaron Gloskowski, a doctor based in Orange, conducted the research
to determine whether sewage spills that have plagued the waters off
Huntington Beach and Newport Beach in recent years have led to an
increase in disease among local surfers.</LD>
<LD>   The Surfrider Foundation, which co-sponsored the study, had hoped
the research would help in its fight to stop the Orange County
Sanitation District's practice of releasing 245 million gallons a day
of partially treated sewage--half of which is processed below federal
standards--four miles off Huntington Beach.</LD>
<TE>   "There's no evidence that [the district's sewage plume] is an
active source for transmission for the hepatitis A virus," Gloskowski
said.</TE>
<TE>   The study showed that three, or about 8%, of the 40 surfers tested
had been exposed to the hepatitis A virus, compared with a 23%
exposure rate for people of the same age in the general population,
Gloskowski said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we'd gotten results that 60% to 70% of the surfers had been
exposed, then we could say, 'OK, we really need to study this,' "
Gloskowski said.</TE>
<TE>   For the study, Surfrider volunteers and nurses spent a weekend
last month recruiting surfers and swimmers fresh from the water near
the Huntington Beach Pier. They also took blood from other surfers
who responded to public notices sent out by Surfrider.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the sanitation district is scheduled to decide
whether to seek renewal of a federal waiver that allows it to treat
half of the waste water it pumps into the ocean at levels below those
adopted by most of the nation's 16,000 sanitation districts. Its
waiver expires next year.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the state Assembly passed a bill that would block the
district from extending its waiver to the federal standards. The
proposal is being debated by state senators.</TE>
<TE>   Gloskowski and Surfrider officials both caution that scientific
conclusions can't be drawn from the limited sampling.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't get enough people tested to show pollution out there is
hurting surfers," said Lisa Brooks, who heads Surfrider's Huntington
Beach/Seal Beach chapter. "We also didn't test for other illnesses."</TE>
<TE>   Stretches of the Huntington Beach shoreline have been closed
repeatedly in recent years because of water contamination. The source
has been difficult to pinpoint despite a $5-million study. Urban
runoff, a nearby marsh, leaky sewer pipes and the district's offshore
sewage outfall are all suspected.</TE>
<TE>   Gloskowski's research fulfilled a requirement for the third year
of his residency program.</TE>

<HD>A Wake-Up Call for L.A. County's Judges</HD>
<DH>The unsolved killings of a court commissioner and his wife
prompt others to take personal security more seriously.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 9:30 p.m. on March 18, 1999, Los Angeles County Court
Commissioner H. George Taylor turned his Mercedes-Benz into the
driveway of his darkened ranch-style home in Rancho Cucamonga.</LD>
<LD>   Taylor, returning from a retirement party for a fellow judge,
hadn't yet turned off the engine when three shotgun blasts, fired
into the car at close range, struck the 68-year-old jurist in the
head and chest.</LD>
<LD>   His wife Lynda rushed outside in her nightclothes to investigate.
She was felled by two shots to the chest.</LD>
<TE>   Both victims were pronounced dead at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   The Taylors' neighbors in the foothills of Mt. Baldy reported
seeing a white compact car, possibly a 1992 Honda CRX, speeding away
after the shooting. The car was never found.</TE>
<TE>   In the three years since then, there have been no arrests, but San
Bernardino County sheriff's detectives are convinced that the
slayings were connected to Taylor's work at Norwalk Superior Court,
where he presided over divorce and child custody disputes, cases in
which emotions often run high.</TE>
<TE>   The last time a judge was murdered in the United States before
Taylor was killed was in 1989, according to newspaper databases.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Vance, a federal appeals court judge, was killed when he
opened a bomb-laden package in his home outside Birmingham, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   His convicted killer, who is awaiting execution, was described by
prosecutors as embittered over Vance's refusal to overturn his 1972
conviction for possessing a pipe bomb.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, the Sheriff's Department maintains a squad
of eight deputies to protect 583 Superior Court judges, commissioners
and referees as well as the five members of the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   "We probably investigate 150 threats a year against judges," said
Sgt. Steve Wheatcroft, who heads the unit. Some threats come from
people who are "just shooting their mouths off," he said, but many of
the more serious threats grow out of decisions in bitterly contested
divorce and child custody cases.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Aviva Bobb, who supervises the county's
family law courts, said she knows of only one or two credible threats
against family law judges in the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   Robert A. Dukes, assistant presiding judge of the Los Angeles
County Superior Court, said Bobb may not be aware of all the threats
family law judges receive because it's up to each judge to report a
threat to law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "I myself have a thick file called 'Letters from Crazies,' and
I've probably referred only a handful for investigation," Dukes said.</TE>
<TE>   Family law can be particularly dangerous, according to a 1997
survey by the American Bar Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The association polled 11,000 members of its family law section.
Sixty percent of respondents said they had been threatened by
opposing attorneys' clients. Seventeen percent told of being
threatened by their own clients.</TE>
<TE>   "Family law cases are like no others," said Maurice Kutner, a
Miami divorce lawyer and former chairman of the ABA's family law
section. "You see good people acting at their worst, as opposed to
criminal cases where you see bad people trying to look their best
before a jury."</TE>
<TE>   Kutner, who keeps a loaded .38-caliber pistol in his briefcase,
said some people "get to a point where if you push them with a
toothpick, they're going to boil over" into violence. "They figure, I
don't care anymore. I lost my wife, I lost my kids, my house. I have
nothing to live for."</TE>
<TE>   Although such risks are well known, the Taylor homicides served as
a wake-up call to Los Angeles County's judges to take their personal
security more seriously, especially outside the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Victor Chavez, then serving as the Superior Court's supervising
judge, issued a memo to his colleagues pointing out that basic
security precautions had not been taken by the Taylors.</TE>
<TE>   The lighting outside their house was woefully poor, he wrote, the
alarm system was not operating and the doors were unlocked. Also, he
said, the Taylors drove cars with personalized license plates.</TE>
<TE>   He urged his colleagues to take advantage of an offer by the
Sheriff's Department to inspect each of their homes and make security
recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   Dukes said many judges have done just that, and have adopted other
security safeguards as well, including varying the routes they take
to work each day.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a lot more careful these days," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For months after the Taylor slayings, a team of five detectives
pored over several hundred of his case files looking for likely
suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Though painstakingly slow, the process has yielded some leads, and
detectives are continuing their investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "They have some suspects they're focusing on," said Dukes, who is
periodically briefed on the investigation's progress.</TE>
<TE>   Dukes, speaking circumspectly, added that investigators "have not
yet been able to develop enough critical evidence to proceed to
prosecution."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and the Superior Court
have posted a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest
and conviction of the killer or killers.</TE>
<TE>   "Some cases just take time," said Det. Sgt. Bobby Dean, who heads
the probe. "Eventually, we're going to solve this."</TE>

<HD>Build Foothill South, Voters Say in Survey</HD>
<DH>Transit: Poll funded by the Transportation Corridor
Agencies finds support for the tollway. About 58% in O.C. favor
project; 36% oppose it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite recent controversies surrounding local toll roads, a new poll
shows that most Orange County voters still favor construction of the
Foothill South, the last piece of the county's 67-mile network of
government-run turnpikes.</LD>
<LD>   If built, the tollway would run about 16 miles from Oso Parkway in
Mission Viejo to Interstate 5 south of San Clemente. Supporters say
the project will relieve South County congestion; opponents contend
the toll road is unnecessary and will destroy valuable wildlife
habitat.</LD>
<LD>   The poll was paid for by the Transportation Corridor Agencies, the
government entity that operates the Foothill, Eastern and San Joaquin
Hills toll roads. It is planning to build the Foothill South with at
least two lanes in each direction.</LD>
<TE>   The opinion survey, released Thursday, found that roughly 58% of
county voters backed the Foothill South project after being told
about arguments for and against the road. Slightly more than 36%
opposed the tollway and about 5% were undecided.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, TCA pollsters found that 54% of county voters backed
the project after being informed of the issues. About 39% were
opposed.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no significant shift in either direction," said poll
director Bob Meadow, who works for Decision Research, based in San
Diego and Washington, D.C. "Given the controversies that the agency
has faced, this is a significant accomplishment."</TE>
<TE>   TCA officials are considering a merger of their toll road
operations to keep the struggling San Joaquin Hills tollway solvent.
Because traffic and revenue have lagged, the highway might default on
$1 billion in bonds by 2012.</TE>
<TE>   Revised ridership projections also have prompted the TCA to
downsize its plans for the Foothill South from eight to four lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Orange County Transportation Authority wants to buy
the 91 Express Lanes, a privately owned tollway that runs down the
middle of the Riverside Freeway. The private toll lanes have been
mired in political controversy, largely because Caltrans gave the
toll road operators the right to block major improvements to the
Riverside Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Decision Research, which has experience with
transportation-related polls, surveyed 1,200 registered voters--500
in San Clemente, 400 elsewhere in south Orange County and 300 in
north and central Orange County. The margin of error ranged from 4.3%
to 5.7%.</TE>
<TE>   The poll, which cost $53,000, is part of the TCA's community
relations effort in support of the Foothill South project.</TE>
<TE>   Pollsters found that when voters were not informed of the issues
related to the road, they favored the project by 56%.</TE>
<TE>   The survey indicated that the largest block of support for the
Foothill South was in South County, where 67% of voters backed the
tollway. In north and central Orange County, 52% of voters favored
the proposal, while in San Clemente 55% did.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the Foothill South, however, dismissed the poll as
another public relations gimmick by an agency that has been unable to
justify the project.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no real traffic forecasts yet or real numbers the
public can base a judgment on," said Bill Corcoran, a regional
representative for the Sierra Club. "As we learn more and more, the
financial risks of this road are apparent."</TE>
<TE>   The Sierra Club, along with the Surfrider Foundation, has made
stopping the Foothill South a national priority because of its
potential impacts on open space, wildlife habitat and San Onofre
State Beach.</TE>
<TE>   TCA officials are in the midst of revising traffic and revenue
projections for the entire system. On Thursday, agency board members
hired Vollmer Associates for $2.8 million to undertake the studies.</TE>
<TE>   The corridor authority has been concerned about inaccurate traffic
projections and recent decisions by the Irvine Co. to dramatically
scale back development plans for east Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Those changes could preclude the expected traffic growth on the
Foothill and Eastern tollways, which so far have been running ahead
of projections.</TE>

<HD>Lawyers in Virk Trial Sum Up</HD>
<DH>Court: Defense calls the Port Hueneme woman a victim of
abuse. Prosecutor says she wasn't helpless.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A distraught Port Hueneme mother accused of trying to drown her two
children was psychotic at the time and incapable of carrying out the
cold, deliberate crime alleged by prosecutors, a defense lawyer
argued Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Cynthia Ellington asked jurors in her closing argument to
acquit defendant Narinder Virk on two counts of attempted murder.</LD>
<LD>   Ellington pointed to this week's testimony from two medical
experts who found that Virk, a 42-year-old illiterate Indian
immigrant, was suffering from stress and severe depression brought on
by years of spousal abuse.</LD>
<TE>   But prosecutor Richard Simon told jurors that Virk was not the
helpless, battered woman portrayed by the defense. "She was not a
bird caught in a storm," Simon said, referring to a witness'
description of the defendant. "She was a killer caught in the act."</TE>
<TE>   During Thursday's proceedings, Virk, draped in a pale traditional
Punjabi scarf, dabbed tears from her downcast eyes as the lawyers
offered starkly different interpretations of evidence presented
during her three-week trial in Ventura County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Virk was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after an Oxnard
resident pulled the fully clothed woman, her daughter and son, then 6
and 9, out of Channel Islands Harbor on Jan. 12, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Neither child knew how to swim.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors charged Virk, who has no criminal record, with
attempted murder and an allegation that she caused great bodily
injury to her daughter, who was hospitalized for more than a week.
She has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.</TE>
<TE>   Ellington told jurors Thursday that Virk was so mentally disturbed
that night two years ago that she could not formulate the mental
state for attempted murder.</TE>
<TE>   According to court testimony, Virk left a note, $600 and some
cassette tapes in a bird cage outside her neighbor's apartment on her
way to the harbor. She threw another audio tape in a storm drain and
tossed her house keys on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Simon argued that the tapes, keys and money are evidence of
premeditation.</TE>
<TE>   He told jurors that Virk was settling debts, leaving $600 and a
relative's address in the bird cage because she knew the neighbor
would find it when she fed the bird the next day.</TE>
<TE>   As for the tape left in the storm drain, Simon argued that the
recording contains evidence of Virk's intention to kill her children
to punish her allegedly abusive husband, Santokh.</TE>
<TE>   "You will not talk with children, neither with son nor with
daughter," she says, according to a transcript of the tape. "No one
is going to take you[r] income, neither your son nor your daughter.
This income you have, only dogs are going to eat it."</TE>
<TE>   Ellington called Simon's suggestion that the tape is a suicide
note conjecture and urged jurors to reject that theory. She also said
the tapes were inaccurately translated from Punjabi, Virk's native
language.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the physical evidence, both lawyers argued at length about
Virk's mental state at the time of the incident.</TE>
<TE>   According to court testimony, Virk's then-husband unexpectedly
boarded a plane for India just hours before the alleged drowning
attempt.</TE>
<TE>   One defense expert testified that Virk, already depressed and
battered, suffered flashbacks to previous trips when her husband left
the family alone for months at a time with no food or money.</TE>
<TE>   The expert told jurors that Virk was delusional and psychotic when
she walked her children to the harbor that night.</TE>
<TE>   Simon tried to debunk that theory, telling jurors that the experts
based their conclusions on Virk's uncorroborated statements about
physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her spouse.</TE>
<TE>   Simon maintained the only way they could find Virk not guilty is
to conclude she was unconscious when she pushed her children into the
marina.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors began deliberations late Thursday afternoon after the
closing arguments.</TE>
<TE>   If Virk is convicted, the case will proceed to a second sanity
phase, during which the jury must decide whether she knew right from
wrong at the time of the incident.</TE>

<LD>Two Simi Valley men have been arrested for their alleged role in a
cocaine sales operation, police said, and two more suspects are
believed to have fled the state.</LD>
<LD>   After a four-month investigation by the Simi Valley police
narcotics unit, Refugio Perez Fernandez, 28, was booked on four
counts of cocaine sales and one count of possession of an assault
rifle. Fernandez also was charged with three counts of child
endangerment after police saw Fernandez's children accompany him
while he allegedly sold drugs, according to police.</LD>
<LD>   Miguel Valdez Lopez, 47, was arrested on suspicion of marijuana
possession and for removing serial numbers from a shotgun. He was
later cited and released. The two other suspects are believed to be
in Colorado, police said.</LD>
<TE>   During the investigation, detectives bought cocaine from the men
six times, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The street value of the seized cocaine is about $12,000, according
to police.</TE>

<LD>Police are looking for a man responsible for a robbery and an
attempted robbery at two Vons grocery stores Thursday evening.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after 5:30 p.m., a white male with a thin build in his
late 20s to early 30s waited in line at the Vons in the 2700 block of
East Thompson Boulevard in Ventura. According to police, the man
robbed two clerks at gunpoint then fled to a car in the parking lot.</LD>
<LD>   The man, was described as 5 feet 9 and 160 pounds, was wearing a
black hat with the initials "CIA" in white letters and a dark jacket
with black pants.</LD>
<TE>   The car was described as a late1990s white Ford Taurus station
wagon. Witnesses of an earlier attempted robbery at a Vons in the
2100 block of North Rose Avenue in Oxnard described the same vehicle
to police. The incident in Oxnard occurred at about 4:45 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Terrorism's New Victims--and Possible Recruits</HD>
<DH>Refugees suffer as the West focuses on its war effort.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARTHUR C. HELTON</AU>
<BD>Arthur C. Helton, a senior fellow at the Council on
Foreign Relations, is the author of "The Price of Indifference:
Refugees and Humanitarian Action in the New Century" (Oxford
University Press, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The preoccupation of the United States and other governments with the
war on terrorism is constricting the hopes of refugees. For example,
many Western governments have increased restrictions on political
asylum. Such a harsh approach poses its own risks because,
ultimately, indifference to refugees compromises safety and security
around the world.</LD>
<LD>   There are now nearly 20 million refugees worldwide who have left
their home countries out of well-founded fear of persecution. This is
the classic definition of a refugee. Think of the tens of thousands
of Central Americans who were granted protected status in the U.S.
after fleeing civil wars in the 1980s, or the hundreds of thousands
of South Vietnamese who came to the U.S. after the North won the war.</LD>
<LD>   Less visible but just as important are the estimated 25 million
people displaced within their countries because of armed conflict and
serious human rights abuses. Both types of displaced people too often
end up warehoused for years in the broken communities called refugee
camps.</LD>
<TE>   Take Ifo refugee camp in northeastern Kenya, where on a sweltering
day recently I visited with Somali leaders in the course of
researching a book. I mentioned to the elders that Ifo looked more
like a town than the emergency encampment I had first visited in
1993. They objected and patiently described the plight of the nearly
130,000 camp inhabitants and the variety of ways in which Ifo is
anything but a normal town.</TE>
<TE>   Violence is so pervasive that residents are afraid to leave their
homes at night. Women who forage for firewood are routinely raped.
Refugees are confined to camp, forbidden to become part of Kenyan
society but prevented by chaos in Somalia from going home.</TE>
<TE>   Western indifference to this misery and corrosive instability can
carry a terrible price. As the world has seen in Bosnia, Rwanda, the
West Bank and elsewhere, refugees can become a dangerous, radicalized
force. Rather than turning away from refugees, we should seek to
solve their need for permanent homes and confront the causes of
displacement in their home countries.</TE>
<TE>   During the Cold War, refugees were trophies for one side,
embarrassments for the other. Both sides encouraged defectors. As the
ideological confrontation receded, Western governments adopted
policies to deter refugees from coming to the West and to contain
them near their home countries. This restrictionism is spreading,
particularly in light of new concerns about terrorism. The issue is
in the headlines in the Los Angeles area, where the Egyptian-born man
who shot to death two people July 4 at Los Angeles International
Airport was reportedly a rejected asylum seeker.</TE>
<TE>   New background checks and security measures have slowed
resettlement of even accepted refugees in the United States. The
costs associated with security measures will surely make our refugee
program increasingly vulnerable in future budget negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Although President Bush established a 2002 admissions ceiling of
70,000 refugees from around the world (mainly from camps), less than
20,000 have arrived with only two months remaining in the fiscal
year. The new antagonism toward refugees is also reflected in debates
in Britain, France, Germany and Spain over tightening immigration and
restricting asylum. Even such a traditionally liberal and welcoming
country as Denmark has now enacted laws limiting haven for asylum
seekers.</TE>
<TE>   During the Cold War, international interventions were avoided in
situations like the abortive Hungarian revolution--which led to a
refugee outflow in 1956--on the grounds that this could invite
retaliation and escalation. By the 1990s, however, the hands-off
policy was clashing with images of humanitarian catastrophes
unfolding gruesomely on the evening news. Public opinion shifted
strongly toward action, and the West launched audacious initiatives
in the former Yugoslavia, northern Iraq, East Timor, Haiti and
Somalia.</TE>
<TE>   The results were decidedly mixed and produced some hard lessons.
The international effort to help Afghanistan recover from two decades
of war is better organized than previous efforts, even though it
still may fail.</TE>
<TE>   The military campaign against Al Qaeda and its Taliban hosts
displaced hundreds of thousands of Afghans. A million more refugees
who previously fled the Taliban have returned to that devastated
country and need help to reestablish themselves. Possible preemptive
military action in Iraq, the Philippines and elsewhere would cause
great additional displacements. The causes of displacement and the
misery of exile must be addressed earlier and more effectively.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the rest of the world grasps the need of refugees for more
than a fenced camp, the radicalism of the hopeless will continue to
nurture terror and cause instability.</TE>

<HD>Boroughs, Instead of 'Winning Ugly'</HD>
<DH>This option could help heal secession campaign wounds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT M. HERTZBERG</AU>
<BD>Assemblyman Robert M. Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys) was
Assembly speaker from 2000 to 2002.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's only July, and already election day looms large on the horizon.
On Nov. 5, the voters of Los Angeles will decide whether it's better
to divide our city into two or three separate cities or to leave Los
Angeles unchanged. I believe there is a better way to go: boroughs.</LD>
<LD>   If secession succeeds, it would be the greatest act of political
division in U.S. history since the South seceded from the Union. If
secession fails, it may be because of a largely divisive, negative
campaign designed to undermine and discredit the secession movement
at any cost.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever the outcome, one thing is certain--it won't be a pretty
sight. You might call it "winning ugly." Either way, it will be a
bleak outcome.</LD>
<TE>   The undeniable truth is that there is a high level of
dissatisfaction in this city. Certain communities feel disconnected
from their city government. Many neighborhoods feel ignored with
regard to issues such as street repair, parks and police protection.
These crucial local services are being administered from too great a
distance--and the system of delivering those services isn't working.</TE>
<TE>   I believe our city needs a more flexible system of government that
is more local, less bureaucratic and more reflective of the diverse
needs of our neighborhoods. Separating Los Angeles into boroughs with
local community representatives would put government where the people
live and allow control of local services at the local level.</TE>
<TE>   Boroughs would empower communities to make decisions about
services, such as senior centers, after-school programs, street
maintenance and parks and recreation. At the same time, a board of
the borough presidents would preside over citywide decisions,
ensuring that regional interests were fairly balanced and that the
critical needs of all citizens were protected.</TE>
<TE>   When I entered the debate over secession, I was fully aware that
the votes weren't there in the City Council to put a borough system
of government before the voters. When was the last time anyone you
know voted themselves out of a job? But for several reasons, I still
believe it has a chance.</TE>
<TE>   First, in a borough system, each borough would elect its own
president. These positions would require high executive skills as
well as legislative ones, as each president would divide his or her
time between local interests and regional concerns. The current City
Council members would make ideal candidates for these positions.</TE>
<TE>   Second, never before has there been such a wave of newly elected
members on the City Council, each fresh from election campaigns in
which they faced growing unrest throughout the city. All of these
council members have heard the message the people are sending and
have expressed their desire to respond to the demand for change.</TE>
<TE>   Third, this proposal doesn't add layers of government. It divides
the responsibility of governing into local and regional authorities
where problems can be effectively dealt with.</TE>
<TE>   Some have expressed concern that a borough system might undermine
the efforts of the neighborhood councils that are just beginning to
take root in communities throughout Los Angeles. Both systems share
the same goal--to engender community involvement--and each system
contributes toward that end in different ways.</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood councils are provided with advisory powers. The
scope of their influence is limited to making recommendations, not
decisions. Each borough board would be made up of elected officials
empowered to make local decisions affecting their community. The
neighborhood councils would provide direct input critical for the
borough boards to make those decisions.</TE>
<TE>   It will be for the City Council to determine in the coming days
what best belongs on the November ballot. Whatever it decides, I am
convinced that the future of our city lies in a borough system of
government. It is the only way to maintain the unity of our identity
and redistribute power to local communities in a way that empowers
neighborhoods in determining their own destinies.</TE>

<HD>Train an Impartial Eye on Police Behavior</HD>
<DH>Departments should routinely use videotape.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANKLIN E. ZIMRING</AU>
<BD>Franklin E. Zimring is a professor of law at Boalt Hall
and director of the Criminal Justice Research Program at UC Berkeley.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saturday's videotaped beating of a handcuffed 16-year-old in
Inglewood would be a pretty big story in any town, but it strikes
with a special sense of deja vu in Southern California, where the
Rodney King videotape exposed citizens to city policing at its very
worst.</LD>
<LD>   With that history, the natural first question is whether this case
is another King episode. The answer is no.</LD>
<LD>   The King case was the result of an organized culture of
recreational police violence. The Inglewood incident isn't that, but
it may ultimately teach us more important lessons about the problem
of excessive force by police and the prospects for its control.</LD>
<TE>   The beating of Donovan Jackson was similar to the King disaster in
two respects. Both beatings grew out of police-citizen encounters
where some use of force by the police was authorized to restrain or
to arrest. In such cases, the issue is not whether force is
authorized but how much force is reasonable in the specific
circumstances. This is a judgment call, and the officer usually gets
the benefit of the doubt if there are conflicting versions of events.
The second similarity is that videotaping by a citizen is the only
reason each case received wide attention.</TE>
<TE>   In a conflict over the use of force on a suspect who provokes an
officer (in this case, the officer says the youth grabbed his
testicles), usually it is the police version that is accepted.</TE>
<TE>   Unless other officers complain--and this doesn't happen much--the
system resolves doubts in favor of the only official version of the
facts.</TE>
<TE>   But the video record of events is more than a tiebreaker. Because
of Saturday's tape, there is no dispute about whether the victim's
injuries came after or before he was handcuffed, and there is no
doubt that force is used long after there is any evidence of
resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the differences between the Jackson case and the King case are
just as important as the similarities.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming the worst about the officer's conduct in Jackson, the
beating administered and the injuries inflicted on King were much
more serious than those suffered in last week's episode. Jackson was
treated and released at the hospital; King was beaten almost to
death.</TE>
<TE>   Both may be examples of excessive force, but I would much rather
be at the receiving end of the injuries that happened Saturday. And
the extent of the damage done in these two attacks is probably an
accurate measure of the intention of the attackers. If the King case
rates a 10 on the scale of police abuse, this latest episode can rate
no higher than a three or four.</TE>
<TE>   A second major difference is that Saturday's force was the product
of a single police officer, while the King beating was the concerted
action of a group of police officers egging each other on. There was
nothing subtle about the King case.</TE>
<TE>   I do not mean to suggest that we should worry less about the
garden-variety overreactions of police officers in the apparent
pattern of Saturday's events. It is such closer-to-the-line cases of
excessive force that happen most often, that are hard to detect and
that are the most difficult to control. Close cases of excessive
force injure many more citizens than gangster cops, and controlling
the behavior of police in close cases is not just a matter of getting
rid of the worst cops. How can we make the close calls? How can we
monitor tens of thousands of police on the streets?</TE>
<TE>   One promising way to monitor police-citizen encounters is with
inexpensive, easy-to-use self-activating video cameras. Some police
departments are using them experimentally. There is, in 2002, no
excuse for conducting a police station interrogation without a video
camera as a silent witness to the proceedings. Street policing will
be harder to record; police cars with camera equipment will not
capture all of the critical interactions of police on patrol. But the
use of cameras would constitute a vast improvement on our current
capacity to observe police field behavior and to evaluate police use
of force.</TE>
<TE>   Force is an inherent part of modern policing. Most of the time
when citizens and cops disagree, the video camera will be the police
officer's friend. Routine recording of police conduct will provide a
powerful tool for assessing police behavior. There is no reason to
leave the recording of police-citizen interactions to chance.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County's Department of Children and Family Services was
created in 1984 from the welfare department so it could better
protect abused and neglected children and help them build happier
futures. But with upward of 35,000 troubled children in its care, the
agency has not yet found its footing--or a director up to the
staggering task. Its fourth permanent director, Anita Bock, was
dumped by county supervisors this month after two years of struggling
with its chronic problems.</LD>
<LD>   The same shameful list of failings has dogged every director:
Children languish in foster care twice as long as in other counties
before they are adopted or reunited with their parents. Taken from
homes because of abuse or neglect, they bounce from placement to
placement, often switching schools and therapists. Social workers are
overwhelmed by large caseloads and the geography they have to cover,
sometimes from Lancaster to San Pedro.</LD>
<LD>   Though Bock is credited with some advances, improving the agency's
computer capabilities, for example, the supervisors canned her
because they grew tired of hearing what she didn't, couldn't or
wouldn't do.</LD>
<TE>   Child welfare agencies elsewhere have made progress, reducing the
time that kids spend in foster care and helping them repair their
lives while they're there. What would it take to do the same in Los
Angeles County?</TE>
<TE>   First, the department needs a strategic plan, not the airy,
optimistic pages dotted with color shots of winsome children that
Bock passed around. A real plan lays out clear objectives and
specifies timetables and milestones. Start with these two goals: Cut
the nearly five years that kids average in county care, and get them
the psychological, medical and educational help they need closer to
their homes.</TE>
<TE>   The county supervisors say they are already collecting resumes,
but, given the department's sorry history, filling Bock's job may be
as hard as recruiting a new chief executive for Arthur Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Child welfare turnaround artists do exist. William Bell in New
York City and Jess McDonald, who oversees Illinois' child welfare
system, are examples. They might be interested in Los Angeles if the
supervisors handed them a clear plan with the authority needed to
follow it.</TE>
<TE>   Once an honest blueprint is in place, the board needs to take a
hard look at the reactive way it has overseen this department in
recent years. Supervisors understandably outraged by reports of a
baby starved or beaten to death in foster care have sometimes
whipsawed directors, derailing efforts to address more widespread,
systemic failings. Yet if the department can cut the time that
children spend in county care and get them the therapeutic services
they need, the odds of another tragedy will be greatly reduced.</TE>
<TE>   If the supervisors begin now to solve this agency's intractable
problems, their choice for director won't matter as much. But if the
department and the children it cares for continue to drift,
litigation and possibly court supervision may be inevitable.</TE>

<LD>Leaders of the San Fernando Valley secession movement were hellbent
on putting their bid to break up Los Angeles on the November
ballot--until last month's Los Angeles Times poll showed secession
losing citywide. Now the chairman and a key financial backer of
secession are making noises about postponing a vote for two years--in
exchange for the city agreeing to substitute a measure creating a
borough system. It's hard to know whether to laugh or cry.</LD>
<LD>   Don't get us wrong--the notion of a borough system is intriguing.
But even if secession leaders had the power to choose another date
now that their campaign is snowballing toward a vote, why would the
city accept a deal like this? Postponing a vote merely gives
secession advocates the chance to gather more support while holding
their sword over Los Angeles for two more years. If they couldn't
dictate every aspect of a borough proposal, they would head back to
the ballot box.</LD>
<TE>   Look at secessionists' "yes, but" record on city reforms and
you'll see that compromise is not their style. Complaints from Valley
VOTE Chairman Richard Close and others that city government ignores
Valley needs have led to the creation of a fifth City Council seat
for the Valley, regional boards that give residents more say in local
planning decisions and a network of neighborhood councils. Yet
nothing slowed a secession crusade that has so far cost taxpayers
more than $2 million in studies without sprucing up a single park,
filling a single pothole or creating a single job for anyone but
consultants.</TE>
<TE>   If city leaders were right to reject the secessionists' boneheaded
deal, however, they would be wrong to dismiss the need to make Los
Angeles work better.</TE>
<TE>   We had hoped Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg and Councilwoman Wendy
Greuel would forge a detailed, pragmatic and politically sensible
plan from their dueling proposals to create a borough system to
better address local needs. That didn't happen. Greuel now wants the
council to put a measure on the ballot committing the city to
creating a borough plan but leaving the details up to a commission.
We're sympathetic to her fear that without a mandate, the idea could
lose steam. But sometimes, good ideas lose steam for a reason. Polls
here show little understanding of a borough system; the Times poll
found that most people favored putting a borough plan on the ballot,
but the poll also suggested that most wouldn't vote for it.</TE>
<TE>   The drive for better local government need not be lost. Many of
the advantages of a borough system, such as bringing public services
to local "city halls" and better coordinating graffiti removal,
tree-trimming and trash pickup, could be provided now if the mayor
and the council had the political will. The secession vote is still
four months away. If the council can be shamed, let it be shamed now
by the threat of city dissolution into providing the local services
that it could have all along.</TE>

<HD>Turkey Needs a New Leader</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Turkey, the only Muslim-majority member of NATO, is a valuable
rarity:  a Muslim nation that also is a secular democracy. A longtime
ally of the United States, it is a leader of the international
peacekeeping force in Afghanistan. But while Turkey is applauded
abroad, at home the government is in bad shape. If it collapses, the
fundamentalist Islamic White Party could rise again, triggering a
reaction by the staunchly secular army.</LD>
<LD>   Frail and ailing Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit clings to power as
his political coalition crumbles. He insists he will stay in office
until  parliamentary elections are held in two years.</LD>
<LD>   Ecevit, 77, emerged in public recently after two months of
struggling with ill health. During his absence, the government was
virtually paralyzed and racked by political strife among factions in
the ruling coalition. At least six  Cabinet ministers resigned this
week. More than 30 members of parliament have quit Ecevit's
Democratic Left Party in protest at his refusal to step down. Those
who want to reform government to bring it closer to Europe and those
who oppose civil reforms are hardening their lines. The only point of
agreement between nationalists and center-right members of the
coalition is that they all want Ecevit to hand over power.</LD>
<TE>   Ecevit should pick a successor and bow out. The economic and
political problems that besiege Turkey demand a new and invigorated
leadership capable of stabilizing the economy and preserving a
$17-billion loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
Turkey wants membership in the European Union, which would require
greater financial stability.  To join, the government also  would
have to increase civil freedoms and ban police torture to comply with
European standards.</TE>
<TE>   Even though only 3% of Turkey's territory is considered to be in
Europe,  the vast majority of Turks have made it  clear they see
their future from a European perspective.</TE>
<TE>   The United States should do everything in its power to persuade
Ecevit, a national hero in the 1980s for his defiance of the ruling
military junta, to step down now. A peaceful, secular Muslim country
that is a reliable partner of the Western alliance in such a
strategic location adds to global stability.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I served with the U.S. Marine Corps Battle Assessment Team during the
Gulf War. Ranan Lurie's July 9 commentary, "Don't Dither as Hussein
Builds Nuclear Devices," advising that the U.S. attack Iraq as soon
as possible, is based on a fundamental flaw as to the number of
troops and the equipment needed to achieve U.S. goals in the 1991
Gulf War.</LD>
<LD>   The Iraqi army had largely gone home prior to our arrival. Had the
Iraqis stayed and fought, and especially if they had decided to use
the chemical and biological weapons that were standard equipment in
Iraqi units, the outcome would have been far different. Indeed, it
was common knowledge that our only recourse in such a situation was
to use nuclear weapons.</LD>
<LD>   In any attack on Iraq, we face the same situation today, with the
nuclear option far more likely than it was in 1991, given that we
have far fewer ground troops available. I have no reason to believe
that intelligence on Iraq and Iraqi forces is better than it was
during our first misguided attempt to deal with Saddam Hussein.</LD>

<LD>"Visa Cut Threatens Rural Clinics" (July 7) misses the real story.
Migrant workers face a shortage of medical care because too few
Spanish-speaking Americans have trained as physicians, not because
too few physicians might emigrate from India. Congress could have
trained minority citizens as physicians. Instead it imported foreign
doctors through special visa programs.</LD>
<LD>   Why offer affirmative action to foreigners instead of our own
people? We import physicians who struggle to learn not just one but
two languages, both English and Spanish, in order to serve rural
clinics.</LD>
<LD>   Shortsighted, yes, but this fits a pattern. Whenever Congress
spots a real or imagined labor shortage, it plugs the gap with
foreigners. I wonder why Congress thinks California needs millions of
immigrants. Is it because Californians are unteachable bumpkins or
because our state suffers a chronic shortage of population?</LD>

<HD>J.C. Watts Can Speak for Himself</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Earl Ofari Hutchinson's July 8 commentary, "A Black Republican Wises
Up and Opts Out," was quite astounding. Apparently, when Rep. J.C.
Watts Jr. of Oklahoma says, "I want to spend more time with my
family," Hutchinson hears, "I've seen the light; where do I get my
passes to the next Al Gore fund-raiser?" Hutchinson further claims
that most black Democrats are opposed to school vouchers, which is
highly debatable. After all, those at the grass-roots forefront of
the voucher movement are inner-city blacks, not exactly the
Republican base.</LD>
<LD>   I was also dismayed to read that the GOP will never accept blacks
as equal partners in power. No doubt Condoleezza Rice, arguably the
most powerful national security advisor in our history, and Secretary
of State Colin Powell will also be shocked to hear this "news."</LD>
<LD>   Christopher Freeland</LD>
<TE>   Oak Park</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So deluded as to presume to speak for the mythical black monolith
throughout his career, Hutchinson now presumes to render his version
of an individual black man's motives--in this case, Watts, a man who,
if nothing else, can speak for himself. I don't imagine that we have
heard the last from Watts in Republican politics. With President Bush
enjoying 40% approval among blacks, Hutchinson's delusional musings
about the politics of race in the Republican Party smell of
desperation.</TE>

<LD>Re "Will the Real Al Gore Please Sit Down," by Crispin Sartwell,
Commentary, July 5: All I have to say is, Mr. Sartwell, please sit
down and shut up! Al Gore should come out fighting for all of us who
voted for him and were silenced by the Supreme Court. I believe that
there is a silent majority out here (beyond the Beltway) just waiting
and being patient for the 2004 elections. Nothing the Republicans can
do will keep us from the polls this time. So go out there, Al Gore.
Pay no attention to this kind of diatribe--and fight for us, who feel
cheated. We haven't forgotten and won't forget.</LD>

<LD>I am outraged at the subhead of "Racism Debate Flares in Israel"
(July 9): "Plan to ban sale of land to Arab citizens hits at heart of
the controversy over Zionism versus democracy." The implication is
that Israeli democrats are not Zionists, and that Zionists are not
democrats.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and his Labor Party are
against passing this law. Peres and Labor are unquestionably
democrats, and most unquestionably are Zionists--those who favor
Israel as a Jewish state. To equate Zionists with those opposed to
democracy is to accept the slander of those who claim Zionism is
racist and anti-democratic by nature.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, some Zionists are racists, and some are
anti-democratic. Many more are neither, however, and will continue to
oppose racist laws, such as the one described in your article, while
recognizing that the principles of freedom and self-determination
that are the true foundation of Zionism require fairness and justice
to all Israelis, whether or not they are Jewish.</LD>

<TE>   The situation isn't as one-sided as the article makes it out to
be. The Israeli government has Arab-only communities on its land, and
there's land owned by Arab municipalities where Jews aren't let in.
The Jewish Agency [which distributes most land in Israel] is actually
a private organization, but one that has had involvement with the
government. Also, it purchased this land with money donated by Jews
to hold in trust for Jews.</TE>
<TE>   I would also feel a little better about this uproar if it were
applied fairly throughout the world. Throughout the Arab world, Islam
receives preferential or exclusive funding. In fact, most governments
are not neutral with respect to ethnicity and/or religion, but I
never see this level of outrage.</TE>

<TE>   Can somebody tell me why Jewish-only towns are considered a
"security measure" while whites-only towns in South Africa were
considered racism? To me they both seem like racist, apartheid
policies.</TE>
<TE>   Why is the U.S. government supporting a foreign government morally
and financially, to the extent of almost $3 billion a year, that
endorses such policies?</TE>

<LD>Re "Farewell to LAX Victims Mixed With Grief, Rage," July 8: Many
people seem to misunderstand the recent shooting at LAX. Like all
homicides, it is tragic. Is it an act of terrorism? No. It was a hate
crime, which is equally devastating.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, Hesham Mohamed Hadayet's shooting spree was no
different from what has become a trend in United States society. When
people are angry and frustrated about something and basically unhappy
with their lives, they take out their gun or guns and kill a person
or two or three. So often it is the ex-husband who returns to kill
his wife and kids or the disgruntled employee, who was recently
dismissed, who returns to decimate his former place of employment.</LD>
<LD>   Setting up security screening prior to entering LAX is not
addressing the real issue of the recent shooting. Hadayet could have
gone to a Jewish retirement home or the Fairfax district. The
location is not the issue. Like so many people, Hadayet needed
counseling. Like so many people, he probably would not have sought
it.</LD>
<TE>   The best solution to these senseless killings is to eliminate
private gun ownership. People such as Hadayet legally purchase
weapons when they are stable and sane. Then, when a moment of passion
strikes, they reach for their weapon and take out their anger on
others.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Wilson</TE>
<TE>   North Hollywood</TE>

<TE>   Why do those who say "put the screening at the doors" not
understand that this just moves the target of queuing people outside?
What next, move the metal detectors to the offramp of the 405
Freeway? Knee-jerk reactions are not what is needed here.</TE>
<TE>   Why was it not terrorism? Well, simply because the "political"
motive is yet unproven. If we define such attacks as terrorism, then
we have to define every lunatic shooting innocent people as
terrorism. This means that the agency responsible is the FBI, which
would be swamped, given the propensity of people in this country for
random acts of violence.</TE>

<LD>Your July 4 editorial on the Yellowstone Park snowmobile decision,
"Protect a Precious Place," was insulting. The "public" support for
the ban came from a fairly small cadre of tax-sheltered, nonprofit
special-interest groups that spent millions of dollars in foundation
grants on a sophisticated political lobbying effort--focused not on
the people who would be most affected by the ban but on urban areas
safely insulated from the economic and social upheaval such a ban
will cause.</LD>
<LD>   I would like to remind The Times that America is a representative
republic. As Americans, the folks who have built their communities,
lives and families around Yellowstone Park still have rights, rights
that deserve respect. Kindly show some.</LD>

<LD>The Los Angeles Board of Education has voted unanimously to place a
$3.35-billion school construction bond measure on the November ballot
(July 10). This is an approximate 50% increase over the amount of
Proposition BB, which was passed in 1997, and the new bond purports
to handle many of the same problems that we were told Proposition BB
would solve. From recent reports I gather that the money from
Proposition BB is gone, and yet the problems remain.</LD>

<LD>After reading "Tollway Trial at a Dead End in California" (July 7) I
thought: "What do the toll roads and the deregulating of electricity
in California have in common?"</LD>
<LD>   Well, let's see. Both fed the public with the usual false optimism
and exaggerated "we are the leader" happy talk. Both are financial
win-win situations for the private sector while the taxpayer is left
holding the bag. Both proved once again that politicians and the
California media were asleep at the wheel when these two debacles
were being hatched. And finally, both are close to becoming complete
failures.</LD>
<LD>   So are we going to blame President Bush for the toll road mess and
claim he's not noble for not bailing us out?</LD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis signed a bill Thursday that dramatically relaxes the
statute of limitations in molestation cases.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, drafted in response to the Roman Catholic Church sex
scandal, received unanimous support in the Assembly and Senate and
was called "the most progressive legislation of its kind in the U.S."
by one nationally prominent victims' rights advocate.</LD>
<LD>   Catholic officials and plaintiffs attorneys expect the new law to
trigger a flood of lawsuits in 2003 from decades-old sexual abuse
cases, including the refiling of suits thrown out earlier because of
statute of limitations problems.</LD>
<TE>   The new law suspends the statute of limitations in molestation
cases for one year, beginning in January, if an institution or
company allowed a known molester to continue to work and that person
went on to abuse another child.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a terrific bill," said David Clohessy, national director of
the St. Louis-based Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests.</TE>
<TE>   "This is truly big," said John Manly, a Costa Mesa attorney who
has filed several sexual abuse suits against the church. "It allows
victims to have a modicum of opportunity for justice and closure."</TE>
<TE>   Existing law allowed victims of childhood sexual abuse to pursue
legal action until their 26th birthday or for three years after they
realized their emotional or physical problems were caused by abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Edward E. Dolejsi, executive director of the California Catholic
Conference, a Sacramento-based lobbying group for the state's 12
dioceses, said his organization took no position on the bill.</TE>

<HD>Algerian's Past Still Puzzling Authorities</HD>
<DH>Immigration: Prosecutor cites his illegal status, ID cards,
passport, facility with languages as hints of terror ties. Defense
claims racial profiling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The FBI is still trying to determine whether a man arrested in Signal
Hill in April on false document charges has links to terrorism or is
just another illegal immigrant.</LD>
<LD>   Algerian citizen Ouiddir Saadi--a.k.a. Saadi Ouiddir, Ouiddir
Saudi, Ahcene Azrine, Hacene Azrine, Hocine Bouchouit--who appeared
Thursday at a Long Beach Superior Court hearing, isn't talking. But
in an interview, Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher Frisco said Saadi's
background, although not definitive proof of a terrorism link, is
troubling and suspicious.</LD>
<LD>   "He's here illegally, he has several false identification cards,
and [he] speaks six languages, including educated German," Frisco
said. "He also has a passport issued by the French Embassy, but the
name on it is not his.</LD>
<TE>   "The passport is of such high quality," the prosecutor added,
"that he either has highly placed contacts within the embassy, or he
paid at least $20,000 for it on the black market."</TE>
<TE>   But Mark McBride, Saadi's court-appointed attorney, believes that
his client is a victim of racial profiling. "I have no reason to
believe he's a terrorist," McBride said. "He's just another illegal
alien who's been living the life of a transient in motels along
Pacific Coast Highway."</TE>
<TE>   Saadi remains in custody in lieu of $100,000 bail and is on a U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service "hold," meaning the agency has
decided not to initiate deportation proceedings pending completion of
a federal investigation into his past.</TE>
<TE>   He faces at least five years in prison if convicted of forgery,
use of false documents, counterfeiting a Social Security seal and
manufacturing or importing a deceptive identification document.</TE>
<TE>   The case unfolded about 1 a.m. April 7, when Saadi was pulled over
and questioned by Signal Hill police at the border with Long Beach.
The officers were investigating a reported convenience store robbery
in the area.</TE>
<TE>   A search of Saadi's gray 1989 Buick Century turned up numerous
documents with at least nine aliases and various addresses in
Pennsylvania and New York, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Also found were a passport with an airline boarding pass for
travel from Brussels to New York; five passport-size photographs,
only one of which was of Saadi; and five postcards of Pennsylvania
skyscrapers, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Saadi, who is believed to be 32, told officers that he was in the
United States on a student visa and that he had arrived in Long Beach
that day.</TE>
<TE>   However, investigators said they turned up a traffic ticket issued
to him March 26 in that city.</TE>
<TE>   An investigation by the FBI and the Long Beach Joint Terrorism
Task Force determined that the name on Saadi's Social Security card
actually belonged to a 1-year-old in Illinois, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   It also found that, in addition to Arabic and German, Saadi speaks
English, French, Spanish and Italian. Frisco noted that the countries
where these languages are spoken are believed to have been staging
grounds for terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Saadi was initially charged with misdemeanor false identification
offenses.</TE>
<TE>   But the continuing investigation of his personal documents and
background motivated prosecutors to file multiple felony charges
against him.</TE>
<TE>   Trial has been set for Aug. 30.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Saadi "is frustrated," McBride said. "He sees
other prisoners being held in jail on similar charges, but they're
getting out and he isn't.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not uncommon for people wanting to live in this country to
have false identification," McBride said. "Nor is it uncommon for
people in Europe to speak six languages."</TE>
<TE>   Frisco said that if Saadi is convicted, the prosecutor will call
for incarceration and recommend against probation.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not your typical false identification case," Frisco said.</TE>
<TE>   McBride disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors "are being overly nervous," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But show me one thing that connects him with terrorists. Until
then," McBride said, "you need more than just a hunch to treat him
differently under the law."</TE>

<LD>   The settlement, however, does not end McCaw's legal battle to
block public access to a 500-foot strip of beach below her 25-acre
bluff-top estate.</LD>
<LD>   McCaw continues to pursue a companion lawsuit to prevent Santa
Barbara County from acquiring the easement it needs to open up the
stretch of beach to the public. After losing in state courts, McCaw
is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court.</LD>
<TE>   Such legal wrangling has increased in recent years as oceanfront
homeowners try to renege on old promises, made in exchange for
building permits, to allow public walkways across their properties.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is surfacing now because as those decades-old legal
commitments begin to expire, government officials and nonprofit
groups are taking steps to adopt the walkways and open them to the
public under the state Coastal Act. Property owners have responded
with a flurry of lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment mogul David Geffen last week sued a nonprofit group
and state officials who have been pushing him to open his wooden gate
so the public can reach the beach--via a sandy walkway he created in
1983 in return for permission to remodel his Malibu beach house.</TE>
<TE>   Geffen asserts that the easement alongside his sprawling beach
house should remain closed because most of Malibu's Carbon Beach--now
blocked by a phalanx of houses--lacks the parking, lifeguards and
bathroom facilities necessary to accommodate the public. "Public
safety is a significant issue," said Steven A. Amerikaner, a Geffen
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   His lawsuit, which was jointly filed by the city of Malibu, comes
a few weeks after the nonprofit group Access for All, brought in
surveyors in preparation of opening the walkway during daylight hours
under the supervision of a beach monitor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about parking or restrooms or public safety," said Steve
Hoye, president of Access for All. "It's about protective privilege
at an impenetrable beach. We listened to Mr. Geffen's fears and
addressed every one of them."</TE>
<TE>   Hoye said he was astounded by Malibu's participation in Geffen's
lawsuit. "The city of Malibu says it's for public beach access, but
it's for access someplace else."</TE>
<TE>   Amerikaner also represents property owners near Santa Barbara
waging similar battles against the state's coastal access law.
Representing homeowners in the Hollister Ranch area and elsewhere, he
helped draft a bill by state Sen. Kevin Murray (D-Culver City) that
would make it far more difficult to open such easements.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the 1,300 unopened walkways are left over from the 1970s
and '80s, when the Coastal Commission required them as a condition of
permits allowing property owners to build on or near the beach.</TE>
<TE>   The ability to designate the easements was curtailed in 1987, when
the U.S. Supreme Court in Nollan v. California Coastal Commission
ruled it illegal to force such concessions from property owners.
State and federal courts have upheld the validity of easements that
were dedicated before the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   That hasn't stopped homeowners such as McCaw from filing legal
challenges.</TE>
<TE>   McCaw bought her estate in exclusive Hope Ranch just north of
Santa Barbara in 1995. With the property, McCaw inherited from a
previous owner an "offer to dedicate" a public easement in exchange
for expanding the house. Such recorded easements are passed along
with property to new owners.</TE>
<TE>   When county officials sent McCaw notice that they were going to
accept the 1983 offer and open the beach to the public, McCaw turned
to her lawyers. She sued the county, asserting that government was
exceeding its authority and "taking" her property without just
compensation.</TE>
<TE>   She also filed a formal notice to revoke the offer to dedicate the
strip of dry sand as public access. That filing prompted the Coastal
Commission to file a "cease and desist" order, which carries fines of
$1,000 to $21,000 a day. McCaw, in turn, sued the commission. The
commission countersued.</TE>
<TE>   A Superior Court judge in San Francisco ruled against her, as did
the Court of Appeal. As more than $20 million in potential fines
accumulated, McCaw's lawyers offered to settle. The commission's
lawyers agreed. Both sides dropped their lawsuits, McCaw removed her
notice to revoke the offer to dedicate the easement and agreed to pay
fines of $460,000. The commission will apply those fines toward the
state's intended purchase of the 746-acre Sea West Ranch near Cambria
on the San Luis Obispo County coast.</TE>
<TE>   "After working for many months on a resolution, I'm glad we
finally settled this extremely expensive litigation by directing
funds toward both the environment and the wildlife of California,"
McCaw said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Carter Phillips, one of McCaw's lawyers, said the reason to settle
was that the related suit against Santa Barbara County advances the
same legal argument, but doesn't carry steep fines. Phillips recently
asked the Supreme Court to take the case.</TE>

<HD>Benny Hernandez, 45; O.C. Educator</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Benny Hernandez, a Latino activist and Anaheim Union High School
District trustee who inspired people in his defiant fight against a
fast-growing cancerous brain tumor, died at home Thursday afternoon,
surrounded by his family.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors expected Hernandez to die 18 months ago, giving him six to
12 weeks to live after they discovered the tumor in January 2001. He
refused to give up hope.</LD>
<LD>   Hernandez, a sixth-grade teacher in Compton until his diagnosis,
spent his time since then speaking at churches and schools, telling
everyone he knew--even those he didn't--to live each day fully. He
once said, "I want to spend my last days reaching out to other
people. I think that's the greatest reward.... I will keep going
until my last breath."</LD>
<TE>   He did just that.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, he helped district Supt. Jan Billings hand out
diplomas to graduating seniors at Magnolia High School. He shook the
students' hands; some leaned over and kissed him as he sat in his
wheelchair. On the drive home, the 45-year-old told his brother,
"This is the greatest night, and I am so excited."</TE>
<TE>   "It was such a high for him," Billings said. "He was surrounded by
these beautiful, young people. They were about to enter a phase of
their life that was exciting, and he was a part of it.... It was the
most wonderful gift."</TE>
<TE>   It was the way Hernandez approached life, even before the tumor,
that won him the respect and admiration of a large network of
friends. He was known for his optimism, his cheerful demeanor and an
ear-to-ear smile that rarely left his face. He spent only $8.13 on
his successful run to unseat a school board incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   He also was deeply spiritual and believed that God gave him the
tumor to test his faith.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a miracle that he lived so long," said Amin David, who
heads Los Amigos of Orange County, a longtime Latino community
activist group. "The best minds in the medical field only gave him
months, and he lived more than a year. He's come to rest ... and we
want to think he is sleeping now."</TE>
<TE>   Maggie Hernandez said her brother's health declined rapidly in the
last week. He quit eating and could no longer drink from a straw. He
was able to speak as late as Thursday, uttering a few simple phrases,
including one he said often: "OK, ready."</TE>
<TE>   "He went peacefully," Maggie Hernandez said. "He did not anguish
at all. Somewhere along the way from when he passed away to when they
took him away, he developed a smile on his face. Even in death, he
was able to get that last smile in there."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez is survived by his son, Alex, 8; his mother, Magdalena
Hernandez; his sister; and his brothers, Henry and David Hernandez.
Funeral arrangements are pending.</TE>

<HD>Gen. Choi Hong-hi , 83; Pioneered Taekwondo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Choi Hong-hi, the Korean general who developed the martial art of
taekwondo more than 50 years ago and watched it attain worldwide
popularity, has died. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Choi, who became a Canadian citizen in 1977, was a longtime
resident of the province of Ontario. He returned to the Korean
peninsula weeks before his death from stomach cancer in Pyongyang,
North Korea, on June 15.</LD>
<LD>   Taking elements from the Korean art of foot fighting, called taek
kyon, and Japanese karate, the self-defense art of taekwondo stresses
physical and mental strength, discipline and humility.</LD>
<TE>   It is now practiced in 150 countries around the globe by as many
as 50 million students. In the United States alone, there are several
million practitioners and family participation is growing. A
demonstration sport in the 1988, 1992 and 1996 Olympic Games, it was
a medal sport in the 2000 games in Sydney.</TE>
<TE>   The man who developed the sport and gave it its name was born in
1918 in what is now North Korea. Expelled from school for leading a
protest against the occupying Japanese, he was sent to study
calligraphy with a tutor who wound up teaching him taek kyon.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1930s, he continued his education in Japan, where he
began to study karate and eventually attained a second-degree black
belt. While in Tokyo in 1942, he and a number of other Korean
students were conscripted into the Japanese army. Returned to Korea
to serve, Choi and several comrades tried unsuccessfully to escape
and join the opposition Korean Liberation Army. Imprisoned on charges
of treason and sentenced to die, Choi was freed when Korea was
liberated just days before the sentence was to have been carried out.</TE>
<TE>   While in prison, Choi began working on the foundations of
taekwondo.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he was one of the founders of the South Korean
army. Sent to the U.S. for training in the late 1940s, he taught the
basics of taekwondo to American servicemen at Ft. Riley, Kan., and
Ft. Benning, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to Korea at the outbreak of the war there and
established an officer training program. Later he created a crack
infantry division, which eventually would produce instructors in
taekwondo for the entire South Korean army.</TE>
<TE>   He named the discipline in 1955 by joining tae (which means foot
fighting or kicking), kwon (to strike with a fist) and do (art). The
International Tae Kwon Do Federation was founded in the mid-1960s and
developed local associations around the world.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1960s, Choi was a supporter of the military coup that
installed Gen. Park Chung-hee as president of South Korea. In 1962,
Choi left the army to serve as South Korean ambassador to Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to Seoul in the mid-1960s and continued to advance
taekwondo, but left in the early 1970s because of the increasingly
repressive political climate under Park.</TE>
<TE>   From his exile home in Canada, Choi taught taekwondo in countries
around the world, including North Korea. He also wrote "The Tae Kwon
Do Encyclopedia," which has become the standard reference work for
the martial art.</TE>
<TE>   Choi's survivors include his wife, Choi Joon-hee; daughters, Sunny
and Meeyun; a son, Jung-hwa; and several grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Line of Questioners for Officers at the Scene</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Local and federal authorities want more
answers from two deputies and three Inglewood patrolmen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All but one of the six law enforcement officers at the scene of the
Inglewood beating of 16-year-old Donovan Jackson remain at work, but
they face questions from several agencies about what they did and
what they saw, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley convened a criminal
grand jury Wednesday to probe the use of force against Jackson during
the Saturday incident. The U.S. Attorney's Office has launched a
civil rights investigation, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department and Inglewood Police Department are conducting internal
reviews. The FBI is also investigating.</LD>
<LD>   Both Inglewood Police Chief Ron Banks and Sheriff Lee Baca said
Thursday that they believe their officers properly reported the
alleged misconduct immediately after the arrest of the boy.</LD>
<TE>   The incident began Saturday evening when two sheriff's deputies
attempted to question a driver, Coby Chavis, about expired
registration tags. Jackson, his son, came out of the gas station
market and, deputies said, did not respond to requests to stay out of
the car and to let them investigate the vehicle violations. Instead,
the deputies said, the boy became tense and unresponsive, and
resisted when one of them wanted to handcuff him.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood police officers then arrived, and a struggle ensued. A
videotape, broadcast nationwide over the last several days, shows
Inglewood Officer Jeremy Morse picking up the boy and slamming him
down on the trunk of a patrol car. Morse then moves behind the
handcuffed boy and punches him on the side of the face.</TE>
<TE>   Although Los Angeles County sheriff's officials say they don't
believe the two deputies at the scene engaged in wrongdoing, they
said they have a list of questions that they want answered. The
deputies, Carlos Lopez and Daniel Leon, will meet with internal
affairs investigators today. The Sheriff's Department's Office of
Independent Review--a group of attorneys hired to help internal
investigations--is shaping the questions that the deputies will be
asked.</TE>
<TE>   The deputies are expected to testify before the grand jury next
week. Lopez, 29, has been with the department seven years; Leon, 27,
has been a deputy sheriff for six years. Both worked in the county
jails prior to coming to Lennox, which is common procedure in the
Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the four Inglewood officers, Mariano Salcedo, Bijan
Darvish and Antoine Crook, are at work between calls to discuss
Saturday's beating before a county grand jury and an Inglewood Police
Department internal investigation. Morse has been placed on
administrative leave during the investigation. Salcedo has been with
the department for eight years, Darvish for three years and Crook for
one year.</TE>
<TE>   The overlapping investigations are welcome to many people who say
the different agencies will focus on separate but critical issues.</TE>
<TE>   "I favor investigations from different agencies," said Merrick
Bobb, a special counsel to the Board of Supervisors who oversees the
Sheriff's Department. "Cooley is looking at, 'Did a crime occur?'
That is different than asking the question of whether the deputies or
Inglewood Police Department officers violated internal policies of
either department."</TE>
<TE>   Bobb said the different sets of questions will be valuable to a
possible criminal proceeding and to possible tactical and procedural
changes that could result from Saturday's incident.</TE>
<TE>   Among the questions for the sheriff's deputies in the internal
review will be why they decided to pursue the vehicle violation
against Chavis in Inglewood, which is outside of the sheriff's
territory. The deputies were on their way to eat when they spotted
the expired registration tags on Chavis' car. Several sheriff's
officials have questioned whether the deputies should conduct
criminal investigations in other departments' areas.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, sheriff's officials still don't know if the deputies
saw all of the force that appears on the videotape. In their report
about the incident, which they filed Saturday night, the deputies
said force was used during the scuffle to handcuff the boy. The
deputies did not mention the officer punching the boy.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Shinee, an attorney representing the deputies, said: "I am
very confident that they acted appropriately, professionally and in
accordance with the department's policies."</TE>
<TE>   Baca agreed, saying he believes the deputies will provide the
grand jury with "clear, thorough and complete information."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Overrules State, Raises Power Cost Cap</HD>
<DH>Utilities: Regulators restore old limit, a 66% hike from
price set by California this week, saying move is needed to avoid
blackouts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Saying action was needed to stave off blackouts, federal energy
regulators stepped into California's latest energy crunch Thursday
and allowed power generators to raise short-term prices this summer.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission action came as milder
weather in parts of the state and appeals for conservation enabled
California to avoid a third consecutive day of energy alerts
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   But the move was sharply criticized--for different reasons--by
Gov. Gray Davis' office, consumer groups and the power industry.</LD>
<TE>   An energy analyst with the Consumer Federation of America
predicted that prices--which have averaged less than $45 per
megawatt-hour for the last month--would soon rise to meet the new
FERC cap of $91.87.</TE>
<TE>   "The [price] ceiling is going to become a floor," said the
federation's Mark Cooper. "They better get the market police out
there to make sure the generators don't withhold power to drive it up
higher. The problem is that the generators' business model is
complaining to FERC and manipulating prices."</TE>
<TE>   FERC's governing board said it was acting only to ensure continued
supplies of electricity to the entire Western region. Sen. Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.) agreed, terming the move prudent.</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulators invalidated a price limit of $55.26 per
megawatt-hour that California officials put into effect Wednesday.
The state action was permitted under the complex price mitigation
formula that FERC devised last year.</TE>
<TE>   In its place, FERC reinstituted the $91.87 price cap that had been
in place since last summer. The new price cap is about 66% higher,
and will be in effect through September.</TE>
<TE>   "We act now because we cannot expose customers in California and
other Western states to the risk of a low price cap," the FERC
governing board said in its unanimous ruling. "A low energy price cap
... could cause severe supply disruptions."</TE>
<TE>   FERC functions like a national utilities commission, and is
charged with ensuring just and reasonable rates for wholesale
electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokesman Steven Maviglio called the agency's action
puzzling.</TE>
<TE>   "Neither the state nor [California's power grid operator] asked
for a near doubling of the price cap," Maviglio said. "California
hasn't had any trouble securing the power it needs at the current cap
of $55. In fact, energy purchases today are in the $20-$30 range. At
first glance, it seems like another gift by FERC to the generators."</TE>
<TE>   Industry Not Pleased</TE>
<TE>   Industry officials called FERC's action an example of government
interference with markets, and said it proves their contention that
the price limits imposed last summer by the agency are unworkable.</TE>
<TE>   "We are back to 'OK, we are just going to pick a price out of a
hat,' " said Mark Stultz, a spokesman for the Electric Power Supply
Assn., which represents marketers and generators. "If the [price
limit] formula doesn't work, then let's come up with a new one and
live by it. Or let's let the markets reach their own efficiency in
terms of allocation of resources."</TE>
<TE>   Only a small portion of the market is subject to the FERC ruling:
the short-term purchases needed to balance the state's day-to-day
electricity needs. Since last year, California has shifted to
long-term, fixed-price contracts for the bulk of its power. For
example, 88% of the power California needed Tuesday had been
purchased in advance.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Katz, energy advisor to Davis, said the impact of the FERC
order will be limited because the state gets so much of its power
through long-term contracts.</TE>
<TE>   But short-term purchases remain important because they can mean
the difference between blackouts and keeping the lights on. And
prices in the short-term market can also affect long-term deals for
power.</TE>
<TE>   FERC officials said the commission acted because some short-term
prices were already higher than $55 when the price cap was lowered to
that level Wednesday evening. Platts Energy Trader, which tracks the
industry, reported that power prices at the benchmark Palo Verde
plant in Arizona on Wednesday ranged between $57 and $70 per
megawatt-hour.</TE>
<TE>   "The $90 cap seemed to be getting all the supply that was needed,"
said one FERC official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "We were
getting more reports of people saying that they wouldn't sell to
California [at the lower price]. That is certainly something we
didn't want to have happen."</TE>
<TE>   Another agency staffer said the commission acted out of its own
concern, and not as a result of pressure from generators. "I think it
was a fear that California wasn't going to get enough power. When you
have a shortage, you've got to expect the price is going to be higher
than $50."</TE>
<TE>   Move Called Prudent</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein, a leader on energy issues in California's congressional
delegation, said the FERC action appeared justified.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on the information I have received from FERC, I think it is
the prudent thing to do right now," Feinstein said. "There is some
concern that there may not be sufficient power at peak demand due to
the record heat wave, but FERC officials feel this cap is a fair
price that can guarantee continued power for California."</TE>
<TE>   In any event, FERC's action is only a temporary solution, because
the system of flexible price caps enacted last summer will expire
Sept. 30. The agency is expected to issue new price control rules by
the end of this month.</TE>
<TE>   The previous price controls have now been set aside and the cap of
$91.87 will remain in place throughout the summer. Under the previous
system, the price limit was reset with each new power emergency. The
limit was set as the cost of producing electricity at the least
efficient power plant called on to run in a given hour.</TE>
<TE>   The idea was to reward newer, more efficient plants, thereby
increasing supply.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Doug Ose (R-Sacramento) said the latest power alerts point to
a continued imbalance in supply, and he criticized the Davis
administration for not doing enough to encourage power plant
construction.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that consumers may pay up to twice as much for
electricity today than they did yesterday is because there is not
enough supply for the California market," Ose said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past two days, [power grid officials have] called for
higher consumer conservation--all this after repeated assurances from
Gov. Davis that his administration has created abundant energy
supply."</TE>

<HD>Judge Lets Slain Girl's Father Into Trial Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The judge in the trial of the man accused of kidnapping and murdering
Danielle van Dam ruled Thursday that the girl's father can return to
the courtroom for the remainder of the trial, but only if he stops
"mad-dogging" the accused killer.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge William Mudd banned Damon Van Dam from the
courthouse on June 25 after the 36-year-old software engineer glared
menacingly at defendant David Westerfield and asked sheriff's
deputies about how Westerfield is brought from jail to court each
day.</LD>
<LD>   A lawyer for Van Dam told Mudd this week that if Van Dam is not
allowed to attend the trial, the jury might think that her father is
disinterested in whether Westerfield is convicted of murdering
7-year-old Danielle. .</LD>
<TE>   In his bid to lift Mudd's ban, Damon van Dam submitted a written
note of apology and promised not to do anything to disturb the trial.</TE>
<TE>   "You should know, Mr. Van Dam, if I get one report of one
incident, I will bar you from the courthouse," Mudd said, outside the
presence of the jury. "I simply am not willing to take a chance."</TE>
<TE>   But defense attorneys raised another caution Thursday about the
behavior of the dead girl's parents. Lead defense attorney Steven
Feldman alleged that Brenda Van Dam, the girl's mother, cursed at a
defense witness and shouted insults at prospective buyers of
Westerfield's former home in their neighborhood, which has been
deeded to his defense attorneys to pay his legal bills.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman said that Brenda van Dam cursed at a neighbor who was
leaving court after testifying on behalf of Westerfield.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Westerfield's position is, he has no problem with [the Van
Dams'] presence, but we do have safety concerns," Feldman said.</TE>
<TE>   But Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek said that an employee with the
district attorney's victim assistance program was with Brenda van Dam
at the time and that she did not curse anyone.</TE>
<TE>   After the short hearing, Mudd recessed the high-profile trial
until July 22 so that he and his wife can go on vacation.</TE>

<HD>Annual Harvest Yields Freshly Converted Souls</HD>
<DH>3-Day Anaheim Crusade Gets Faithful in Churchgoing Mode
Without Delay</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The transformation of more than 10,000 new believers into churchgoing
Christians at the three-day evangelical bash known as the Harvest
Crusade begins tonight, moments after many of them make a profession
of faith on the outfield grass at Anaheim's Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   With nearly the efficiency of a cardiac surgical team, Harvest
organizers will immediately pair each fledgling Christian with a
friendly crusade veteran, who will give the convert a beginner's
Bible and an MP3 or compact disc with a narration of the entire New
Testament. Volunteers from 120 churches, working at computers under
the right field bleachers, will process information cards to link the
new believers to a church near them.</LD>
<LD>   For those battling severe problems such as addiction, marital
breakup or depression, trained pastors will be standing by on the
baseball field's dirt warning track for impromptu counseling.</LD>
<TE>   Within a week, letters and telephone calls will welcome the
novices into the body of Christ and address their questions.</TE>
<TE>   Those quick steps will propel about 50% of the people who step
forward during the crusade into a church within a month, organizers
say. And those "saved souls" are the ultimate product of a modern-day
revival that will draw an estimated 110,000 to hear Christian rock,
hold hands in prayer and hear messages from the event's founder, Greg
Laurie, and the Rev. Franklin Graham, who recently took over the
ministry started by his father, Billy Graham. An estimated 30,000
more will view the event on the Internet (www.harvest.org).</TE>
<TE>   The well-oiled follow-up machinery has been refined over the
crusade's 13 years, but retention of converts is a concern at any
major evangelical event, where promises made in an evening's fervor
can fade with the next day's sunrise.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to help them in the decision that they made," said Rick
Doucette, a Harvest Crusade director, adding that volunteers are
trained in the soft sell. "We don't force anything on them. It's all
done with care and compassion."</TE>
<TE>   Niki Curry, 41, of Long Beach still calls the evening nine years
ago when she professed her belief at the Harvest Crusade "the best
night of my life." Since then, she has served as a volunteer. This
year, she'll be one of 5,000 follow-up counselors to those pouring
onto the field each night following Laurie's message, now translated
into Spanish, Korean, Arabic, Vietnamese and sign language.</TE>
<TE>   "I love to pray with the folks, just like people did for me," she
said. She's befriended converts who were drug addicts, people
struggling with divorce and, last year, a 10-year-old boy whose
mother was dying of cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The talks often continue in the parking lot, long after Edison
Field closes for the night. "We walk them to their cars," she said.
"They just need to talk sometimes. They need someone to listen. These
are people who are just broken."</TE>
<TE>   Each night of the crusade, Laurie says, he usually gets about 10%
of the crowd to profess faith in Jesus. That means about 233,000 such
declarations during his crusades in the United States and abroad,
which have drawn crowds totaling 2.5 million, organizers say.</TE>
<TE>   While follow-up techniques have evolved over years, Laurie's basic
formula for reaching the unchurched hasn't changed from his first
crusade in Orange County in 1990: Provide the hippest Christian
entertainment (this year's bands at Edison Field include Delirious?,
Switchfoot and the Katinas), in a nonthreatening environment (a
stadium), then give people who normally wouldn't darken a church door
a healthy dose of the Gospel.</TE>
<TE>   "We bring the message of Jesus Christ into a nontraditional
setting so a skeptic or a downright nonbeliever" will hear the words
unfiltered by a popular culture that Laurie says has stereotyped
Christians and skewed the message.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people think Christians aren't normal," Doucette said. "We
show them Christians can be cool, and we have something to offer that
everyone is seeking."</TE>

<HD>Racial Animus in Case Denied</HD>
<DH>Police: Inglewood chief says he is disappointed by
officer's actions but urges all concerned to reserve judgment until
investigations are done. Inquiry is stepped up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY and HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five days after a videotaped beating by an Inglewood police officer
sparked protest and criminal investigations, the city's police chief,
Ronald Banks, publicly addressed the controversy for the first time
Thursday, saying he was disappointed and concerned over the taped
images but rejecting the suggestion that the incident was racially
motivated.</LD>
<LD>   Inglewood Mayor Roosevelt Dorn has said the officer who struck
16-year-old Donovan Jackson should be fired and prosecuted. Banks, by
contrast, urged Inglewood residents and others to reserve judgment on
the case until an investigation is completed.</LD>
<LD>   Banks did not mention Dorn by name. But the chief, who was on
vacation when the incident occurred, said any city official who
voices a decision on the case too soon could jeopardize the
investigation.</LD>
<TE>   "For public perception, and maybe from a legal perspective, it
could create a problem," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The chief's news conference occurred as local and federal
authorities were stepping up their efforts to confront the July 6
beating and its aftermath, and protesters were continuing to demand
action. So intense was the scrutiny that Banks referred to the past
few days as the "siege of the Inglewood Police Department."</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Boyd, who heads the U.S. Justice Department's civil rights
division, flew to Los Angeles to meet privately with Inglewood
officials and others, and in downtown Los Angeles a parade of
witnesses appeared before the county grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   One of those whose testimony was sought by that panel was Mitchell
Crooks, 27, the deejay who shot the videotape of the beating that now
has aired across the nation. Crooks was under subpoena to attend the
grand jury hearing with his tape, but he did not appear as ordered,
and instead was confronted by police outside CNN's Los Angeles
studios, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Crooks ran from police, they added, and he said later that he was
hurt in the scuffle. He was arrested on warrants for petty theft,
driving under the influence and hit-and-run, according to the
district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   The three charges stem from a sequence of events in February 1999.
Sheriff's Capt. Rick Armstrong said Crooks is accused of driving
under the influence on Interstate 80 in Roseville, northeast of
Sacramento, when he became involved in a wreck. Armstrong said that
after the accident, Crooks drove to the nearby town of Rocklin, where
police caught him trying to steal two VCRs from his mother's home.</TE>
<TE>   He was convicted of all three crimes in March 1999 and ordered to
begin serving a seven-month sentence in Placer County Jail in May of
that year. But he never showed up for the jail sentence, and a
warrant was issued for his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, prosecutors, who had been looking for him
all of this week, responded to several tips regarding Crooks'
whereabouts over the last several days, said Sandi Gibbons,
spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. Investigators tailed
Crooks, but were one step behind him until Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Curt Livesay said Crooks could have
avoided the arrest if he had responded to earlier requests to
cooperate with investigators.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's put it this way: Had we been able to secure his presence on
the first day, the second day or the third day, we wouldn't have even
known about the warrants," he said. "He could have been here and gone
and been free today."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The videotape that Crooks shot has sparked angry protests and
comparisons to the 1991 beating of Rodney King by several Los Angeles
police officers.</TE>
<TE>   In the Inglewood case, Jackson can be seen in the video as he is
thrown face-down against the hood of a police car and punched in the
face while handcuffed. Jackson is black. The officer shown shoving
and hitting Jackson, Jeremy J. Morse, is white.</TE>
<TE>   Morse was relieved of duty with pay Monday.</TE>
<TE>   At his news conference, the police chief rejected comparisons
between the King and Jackson incidents.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is a modicum of comparison between this and
the Rodney King case, and I'm very familiar with the Rodney King
case," said Banks, who was a deputy chief in the Los Angeles Police
Department at the time of the King beating.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Inglewood incident began Saturday after two county sheriff's
deputies approached Jackson's father, Coby Chavis Jr., at a gas
station to question him about an expired license tag on his Ford
Taurus. Four Inglewood officers arrived to assist.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's deputies and Inglewood police said they had been talking
to Chavis about the tags when Jackson came toward them while eating
from a bag of potato chips. Deputies and Inglewood police said the
scuffle was sparked when Jackson refused to comply with police
orders. Jackson's family said the boy is mentally impaired and reacts
very slowly to commands.</TE>
<TE>   In his report, written before the videotape was aired on
television, Morse admitted hitting Jackson. The officer said he did
so because Jackson, whose hands were cuffed behind his back, reached
back with his right hand and squeezed the officer's crotch.</TE>
<TE>   Banks said he was "concerned and disappointed" by the tactics used
in the incident. He added that the officer's actions are "not
reflective of our way of doing business."</TE>
<TE>   He declined to elaborate. By contrast, Mayor Dorn continued to
criticize Morse on Thursday , saying in an interview that even if
Jackson grabbed him while on the hood of the police car, Morse
already had picked up the boy and slammed him into the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know whether [Jackson] grabbed him or not," Dorn said.
"But if he did, does that justify what happened before he grabbed his
testicles?"</TE>
<TE>   John Barnett, Morse's lawyer, said the officer was forced to lift
and drop Jackson on the hood because the teenager had gone limp and
was unwilling to stand. "He's going to stand him up, but the subject
makes himself loose," Barnett said. "He has to lift him ... and
literally drop him on the car, so that he doesn't fall down."</TE>
<TE>   The incident has prompted separate civil rights investigations by
the FBI and local authorities.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, troubled by the videotape,
dispatched his top civil rights lawyer, Boyd, to Los Angeles to lead
the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd met Thursday with federal prosecutors, FBI agents and Mayor
Dorn. Boyd, who could not be reached for comment, worked extensively
with city officials in Cincinnati last year after allegations of
police brutality and racism sparked rioting there.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials would not say what input if any the
White House had in the decision for the agency to intervene in the
case.</TE>
<TE>   But an FBI official who asked not to be identified said FBI
investigators in Los Angeles had opened an inquiry Monday after
seeing the videotape, even before the Justice Department directed the
bureau to probe the beating.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley continued
to bring witnesses before the grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials declined to identify the witnesses or
discuss Thursday's testimony. Sources say the two deputies at the
scene of the arrest are expected to testify next week.</TE>
<TE>   Since the videotape hit the airwaves, Morse has been accused by
several others of using excessive force in other cases. Chief Banks
declined to discuss those cases, but Morse's lawyer, Barnett, said
they are the work of people looking to capitalize on allegations
against his client.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Patricia Surjue, a Justice Department employee, filed
a civil rights lawsuit, alleging that Morse and two other Inglewood
officers illegally entered her home in October and began to shove and
threaten her in front of her two children.</TE>
<TE>   The suit says Chief Banks and Mayor Dorn have failed to conduct "a
meaningful or proper investigation and did nothing to discipline or
correct" the alleged abuses.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Neilson Williams, 32, accused Morse and others of
handcuffing him and beating him with batons near Ashwood Park.
Williams said he spent five days in the hospital, including time in
the intensive care unit. He has filed a complaint with the Inglewood
Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   County Sheriff Lee Baca, Dorn and Banks will attend a meeting
today with local ministers in Inglewood who want assurances that the
case will be thoroughly investigated.</TE>

<HD>Kirk Kilgour, 54; Volleyball Standout</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kirk Kilgour, an All-American volleyball player at UCLA before
suffering a neck injury in 1976 that left him a quadriplegic, died
Wednesday night at Mediplex Specialty Hospital in Thornton, Colo. He
was 54.</LD>
<LD>   Kilgour had battled pneumonia over the last year. The cause of
death was not immediately known.</LD>
<LD>   He led UCLA to its first national volleyball championship in 1970,
paving the way for what would become the strongest men's volleyball
program in the nation.</LD>
<TE>   In three seasons, Kilgour helped UCLA compile an 80-5 record and
was a three-time All-American. UCLA also won a national championship
in 1971 with Kilgour.</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of the first big men who could do everything well,"
said Coach Al Scates, who recently completed his 41st season at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "He could hit from anywhere. He was one of the first great
athletes in NCAA volleyball."</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from UCLA, Kilgour was a member of the 1972 U.S.
national team and in 1974 became the first American player to compete
in Italian First Division volleyball.</TE>
<TE>   In January 1976, Kilgour was leading an agility drill with team
members in Italy when he flew off a springboard, landed between two
mats and dislocated the fourth and fifth vertebrae in his neck.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that he almost died--he lost 70 pounds in the first nine
days after the injury--left Kilgour with a unique spin on the injury.</TE>
<TE>   "I love life, and I'm not going to waste a minute of it being
bitter about it," Kilgour told The Times in 1995. "I've lived a
charmed life. I know how to be happy. I'm very rarely low."</TE>
<TE>   Kilgour sometimes joked about using a wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not in a wheelchair," he once said. "I'm in a golf cart
without paying greens fees."</TE>
<TE>   Kilgour, a longtime motivational speaker and hospital volunteer,
received recognition from the U.S. House of Representatives for
community service and was recognized by the California state Senate
for "lifelong dedication on behalf of individuals with developmental
disabilities."</TE>
<TE>   Kilgour, who grew up in Manhattan Beach, was a basketball player
at a community college in Bellevue, Wash., when Scates spotted him
playing in a summer volleyball tournament at a Southland beach.
Scates offered Kilgour a volleyball scholarship on the spot.</TE>
<TE>   "He was so quick and he jumped so high out of the sand," Scates
said. "He had an arm like a whip. As soon as he finished playing [in
the tournament], I recruited him."</TE>
<TE>   Kilgour coached at Pepperdine from 1979-81, leading the Waves to a
38-31 record. He was an assistant coach when the Waves won the 1985
NCAA volleyball championship.</TE>
<TE>   Coaching from a wheelchair and unable to demonstrate physical
techniques, Kilgour said he learned to become a true student of the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "I became a much better coach," he said. "I had to break every
skill down to the most minute detail."</TE>
<TE>   Kilgour remained part of the volleyball community after leaving
Pepperdine, acting as a TV commentator for Olympic telecasts in 1992
and 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Until two years ago, he was the public-address announcer for UCLA
men's and women's home matches.</TE>
<TE>   Last February, UCLA defeated USC in the 25th Kilgour Cup, an
annual benefit that helped raise money for Kilgour, who did not
attend the event this year.</TE>
<TE>   A UCLA spokesman said the school plans to continue the event next
year.</TE>
<TE>   Kilgour is survived by a sister, Karen Sutter, and his mother,
Bonnie.</TE>

<HD>Onslaught of Media's Reaction Recalls the Rodney King Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY, ELIZABETH JENSEN and GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Compelling videotape of alleged police brutality has again
demonstrated television's appetite for such imagery, broadcast news'
ability to help set the political agenda and, critics say, its
potential through repeated exposure to inflame such situations.</LD>
<LD>   Television's use of home video that shows an Inglewood police
officer slamming handcuffed teenager Donovan Jackson onto the trunk
of a patrol car and then punching him in the face has spurred the
Justice Department to say it will investigate the matter, fueled
outrage among community activists and filled talk radio with hours of
debate.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the coverage is already prompting discussion
about the media's role in such events, as well as warnings about the
need for journalistic restraint. In that respect, the Inglewood
case--and a separate event this week in Oklahoma, involving footage
of white police officers beating a black suspect--has raised
comparisons with the media furor that surrounded the 1991 beating of
motorist Rodney King, which, after repeated television exposure,
stoked the anger that helped lead to the Los Angeles riots.</LD>
<TE>   The Jackson videotape, recorded by onlooker Mitchell Crooks, has
played repeatedly on local TV stations and all-news cable networks.</TE>
<TE>   CNN, for example, covered the story extensively this week.</TE>
<TE>   As with the King case, media observers say that what sets these
stories apart from the other charges of police brutality leveled
every year is the availability of striking pictures to tell the
story.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost certainly, the video drives this coverage to a greater
degree than the story would get otherwise," said Bob Steele, director
of the ethics program at the Poynter Institute for journalism
studies. The video provides the visual storytelling that TV demands,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although activists and some callers to talk radio have cited the
video as conclusive evidence of brutality, some caution that the
images need to be viewed with skepticism.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Woods, another Poynter professor who specializes in coverage
of race relations, recalled an incident several years ago in
Philadelphia in which TV news aired footage of a fraternity party
that got out of hand. Over the next several days, more videos
surfaced from different angles, and "what first appeared to be a
pretty flagrant act of police brutality turned out to be a much more
nuanced," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Woods said, journalists should be cautious not to
promote such tapes "as if it's the be-all and end-all of smoking
guns."</TE>
<TE>   Experts say such excessive promotion by TV outlets can skew the
public's perception of the tape's news value.</TE>
<TE>   Steele added that there is extra reason for caution "when the
video comes from a non-journalistic source."</TE>
<TE>   Academics note that such stories would often benefit from waiting
until journalists have time to gather more facts, but that seems
increasingly unlikely in the current, highly competitive news
landscape, which puts an enormous premium on immediacy.</TE>
<TE>   Both Fox News Channel--currently the most-watched cable news
network--and MSNBC started in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Despite competitive pressures, broadcasters insist they have been
responsible in addressing the story. On Thursday, KABC-TV's
"Eyewitness News" was preparing a piece comparing the Inglewood case
with the footage of the King beating.</TE>
<TE>   "The story is still so fresh, and there are so many questions
about what happened, that we want our viewers to make their own
judgments," said KABC news director Cheryl Fair.</TE>
<TE>   Fair added that she did not want the footage to become a generic
tape that would be played with every new development. "There has to
be a reason for running it--we don't want to be gratuitous with it,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ratio talk shows have weighed in regularly on the Inglewood story,
with most local hosts arguing against condemning the police officers
without additional facts.</TE>
<TE>   "The tone that we've taken is, we need to remain calm at a very
emotional time," said Erik Braverman, program director at talk-radio
station KABC-AM (790) in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Action Imperils Dream Job</HD>
<DH>Career: Officer Morse achieved his life's goal to be a cop,
but working in Inglewood wore on him, friends say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He grew up in Oregon's high desert wanting to be a cop, then followed
his dream to the tough streets of Inglewood.</LD>
<LD>   Jeremy J. Morse told his friends he loved helping people, but
flinched when residents returned his waves with obscene gestures.</LD>
<LD>   He pumped weights regularly, building strength and beefy forearms
so he would never lose his gun to a suspect.</LD>
<TE>   At 24, he already had three years under his belt. Colleagues
called him a good cop, and he aimed at someday winning a promotion to
detective.</TE>
<TE>   But now Morse finds himself at the center of the nation's latest
videotaped law-enforcement storm, his beating of a 16-year-old boy
held up by many as a frightening example of police brutality.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood Mayor Roosevelt Dorn wants him fired. Residents scream
for his arrest. And authorities from as far away as Washington, D.C.,
have descended on the city to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   Morse has been suspended with pay. At his modest Ontario home, the
shades are drawn and a lawn-sodding project sits unfinished, with
several mounds of dirt still piled around the front yard. A
middle-aged man who answers the door says he is not related to Morse,
but expresses sympathy.</TE>
<TE>   "People go through hell out there," he said. "I understand his
situation."</TE>
<TE>   Morse's family and friends say Saturday's incident marks a tragic
turn for a young man who had dreamed of a police career since his
childhood, which he spent fishing and playing baseball in Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   They say he was always a straight-arrow kid, a Christian youth
counselor who didn't hesitate to break up mischief in the town of
Hermiston where he grew up.</TE>
<TE>   "He was not the type to stand there and watch. He was a
take-charge type of guy," said Matt Fiocchi, a close childhood
friend.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see on the videotape: He's the first guy to do anything.
He's always in the middle of things. He always really wanted to make
a difference."</TE>
<TE>   Fiocchi, like other friends and relatives, thinks he acted in self
defense. Fiocchi says Morse may have "lost his cool a little bit,"
but not without a reason. A police report quotes Morse as saying he
punched the boy, Donovan Jackson, only after the handcuffed teenager
grabbed Morse's testicles.</TE>
<TE>   Morse's stepfather, Roger Pettit, defends him: "If Jeremy did
that, it's because he was provoked somehow. I mean, that's his
character.... He's not going to upright and hit somebody. He just
wouldn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   Morse's role in the beating is being scrutinized by four law
enforcement agencies. One of them, the federal Justice Department, is
investigating for possible civil rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   For some, watching the white officer slam the black teenager to
the car, strike him in the face and then wrap thick hands around the
youth's neck leaves little doubt about his guilt.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a rogue police officer," said Assemblyman Jerome Horton
(D-Inglewood). "There's no getting around it."</TE>
<TE>   Morse's Inglewood life is a world away from the rural town where
he spent much of his youth. Though born in Southern California, he
moved as a child to Hermiston, a town of 13,000 in northeast Oregon
near the Washington border.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, a prison guard, and father, a warehouse worker,
divorced when he was young. Afterward, Morse bounced between the
parents' homes.</TE>
<TE>   He was a star pitcher, and a lineman for his high school football
team. He also became a leader of a high school Christian youth group
called Campus Life.</TE>
<TE>   Morse led younger children on boating trips and Bible study
sessions. His friends say he sought leadership roles to help steer
children away from the traps of small-town life, such as drinking,
drugs and midnight mailbox-bashing.</TE>
<TE>   Even as a youth, they said, Morse's career as a cop seemed
predestined. Driving around the town's dusty streets, Morse would
never hesitate to intervene when he saw trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a real strong sense of right and wrong," said Deborah
Fiocchi, the mother of Morse's best friend. "One time he saw kids
throwing rocks at some other kids, and he was so angry, he stopped
them and gave them a talking to."</TE>
<TE>   After finishing high school in Southern California, Morse joined
the Inglewood force, first as a cadet and a short while later as an
officer.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous officers refused to comment about Morse's Inglewood
career, citing a departmental gag rule. Officials have refused to say
whether Morse had received commendations or been subject to
disciplinary actions, saying his personnel records are confidential.
His attorney, John D. Barnett, said Morse recently received a
department commendation after taking into custody a man armed with a
knife. "He took him without killing him. He could have shot him,"
Barnett said.</TE>
<TE>   But court records also show that two people filed a lawsuit
Wednesday, accusing Morse and another officer with beating them in
January. In another case, a 22-year-old woman alleged that Morse had
struck her with a baton while breaking up a New Year's Eve party.</TE>
<TE>   According to his friends and relatives, Morse, for the most part,
has enjoyed being a cop. For a man who became an officer to "clean up
the community," Fiocchi said, Inglewood was a challenging place.
Morse also made many friends on the force, and at one point lived
with three officers in a six-bedroom house in Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   To support their contention that Morse has no racist tendencies,
his friends note that he grew up around Latinos in Hermiston, which
has a sizable immigrant population. Morse's girlfriend, they said, is
a Latina.</TE>
<TE>   But Fiocchi said the job sometimes wore on the young cop, and
hardened him. Though Morse liked the excitement, he said he often
encountered gun-toting suspects. Once, Fiocchi said, a weapon fell
out of the coat of a man Morse had just tackled during a chase.</TE>
<TE>   Morse, Fiocchi said, also missed the quainter aspects of
small-town life, where he liked to befriend residents. In Inglewood,
Fiocchi said, Morse complained that his overtures were often greeted
with obscenities.</TE>
<TE>   "All I want to do is smile," Fiocchi recalls Morse saying once.
"But when you start waving to people, all they do is flip you off."</TE>
<TE>   Some community members say Morse's own actions sometimes reflected
that rude sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   Willie Agee, 72, an Inglewood parks commissioner and longtime
resident, said he had run into Morse often at City Hall, where the
two often exchanged pleasantries. But Agee said Morse and another
officer acted unprofessionally about two years ago toward a black man
whom they had stopped for a minor traffic violation.</TE>
<TE>   "They screamed at him and yelled at him," then drove away, Agee
said. "Just laughing their tails off."</TE>
<TE>   The videotape of the Saturday confrontation shows Morse hoisting
Jackson by the collar and banging him hard against the police car.
The officer, bleeding from a cut on the side of his head, then slugs
the youth with a fist and places his hands around the youth's neck.
Other officers intervene before the youth is walked to a police car.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Morse's friends and family members blame the youth, saying
his conduct brought on the rough treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't respect a person who attacks a police officer and then
turns around and starts threatening him," Fiocchi said. "I just think
he's a bad kid. Anybody who attacks a police officer is just wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Despite their beliefs, some friends and family members fear that
the incident could spell the end of Morse's career.</TE>
<TE>   "He's pretty sad. He's shook up," he said. "He really wants to be
a police officer, and he's hoping and praying that he'll make it
back."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Richard Fausset, Janet Wilson, Anna Gorman,
Garret Therolf, Tina Dirmann and Daren Briscoe contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>Accused Killer's Plea Bid Rejected</HD>
<DH>Courts: Ventura County prosecutors seeking the death
penalty refuse a 'no contest' offer in the slaying of a student.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Simi Valley serial rapist Vincent Sanchez offered to plead no contest
to murder, rape and related charges Thursday--a move prosecutors
flatly rejected.</LD>
<LD>   "Unfortunately, it is not a surprise," said Chief Deputy Public
Defender Neil Quinn. "They seem to have their minds made up."</LD>
<LD>   The Ventura County district attorney is seeking the death penalty
for Sanchez, a 31-year-old handyman accused of gunning down a
Moorpark College student during a kidnap and rape attempt last
summer.</LD>
<TE>   Sanchez is charged with first-degree murder, attempted rape,
attempted kidnapping and special circumstance allegations that make
it a death penalty case. He is also charged with counts regarding
alleged assaults on two other women.</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing Thursday, Sanchez offered to plead no contest to all
of the charges and accept a sentence of life in prison without
possibility of parole. He also offered to waive his rights to an
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   But Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Lela Henke-Dobroth told Superior
Court Judge Ken Riley that her office was not interested.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not be accepting the defendant's plea, your honor. It's
as simple as that," Henke-Dobroth said.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez's plea offer was not a surprise. He has admitted killing
20-year-old Megan Barroso, but denies that he shot her during a
kidnap and rape attempt as prosecutors allege.</TE>
<TE>   Several months ago, Sanchez attempted to plead guilty to murder
without specifying a degree of the crime. Prosecutors also rejected
that proposed plea.</TE>
<TE>   Henke-Dobroth said at the time that the district attorney was not
interested in making a deal and instead wanted to go to trial.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor argued at a recent preliminary hearing that Sanchez
was a predator who assaulted a dozen women, raping six at knifepoint,
during a string of increasingly violent attacks between 1996 and
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend those attacks culminated with the July 5,
2001, killing of Barroso. She died after being shot with an AK-47
assault rifle while driving home from a friend's house.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege Sanchez dragged the mortally wounded Barroso
from her bullet-ridden car after it rolled to a stop beneath a
freeway overpass near Moorpark. They say he then tried to rape her.</TE>
<TE>   Barroso's partly clothed body was found a month later in a ravine
near Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez denies that he attempted to sexually assault Barroso, and
his attorneys argue that there is no evidence to prove the alleged
rape attempt.</TE>
<TE>   But Quinn said Thursday that Sanchez, who is already facing life
in prison after pleading guilty last fall to numerous sexual
assaults, is remorseful and ready to accept responsibility for the
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "He is willing to close the case by dying in prison," Quinn said.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez did not enter a plea Thursday. His arraignment was
postponed until this morning, when he is expected to again attempt to
plead guilty to murder without specifying the degree.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona said Thursday that
prosecutors have researched the issue and concluded that Sanchez
cannot enter such a plea.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn disagrees. "We feel we have the law on our side," he said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The school board voted 3 to 2 to name a new high school after Cesar
Chavez--even though it may have to pay a $100,000 penalty because not
everyone in this farming town agrees with the decision.</LD>
<LD>   When the school district bought the 55-acre site from grape grower
Walter "Bud" Gamboni, he made the board liable for $100,000 in
damages if it gave the school any name that causes "extreme
embarrassment and emotional stress."</LD>
<LD>   Chavez led United Farm Worker actions against grape growers in the
1960s and '70s.</LD>
<TE>   Delano schools Supt. Sherrill Hufnagel said the damages will come
from interest on bonds and state construction money.</TE>

exactly what caused his ailment.</LD>
<LD>   Group A Streptococcus is a common bacterium found in the throat

<HD>O.C. Lawman's Son, 17, Held in Rape</HD>
<DH>Police: The teen and two others are accused of assaulting
an unconscious girl at the assistant sheriff's Newport Beach home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL WILLON and MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 17-year-old son of Orange County Assistant Sheriff Donald G.
Haidl is one of three teens suspected of raping an unconscious girl
at Haidl's home in Newport Beach, law enforcement sources said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Police allege that the three teens drugged the 16-year-old girl
and videotaped their sexual assault during a July 5 party at Haidl's
house in Corona del Mar. Authorities did not disclose whether the
assistant sheriff or any other adults were home at the time.</LD>
<LD>   Newport Beach police declined to identify the alleged attackers
because they are juveniles, but Orange County sheriff's spokesman Jim
Amormino said a Haidl family member was among those arrested. Two law
enforcement sources confirmed one of the suspects was Haidl's
17-year-old son.</LD>
<TE>   The assistant sheriff and his ex-wife, who lives in Alta Loma in
San Bernardino County, share custody of the juvenile, according to
court records. The couple also have a 22-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   An informant, whom police would not identify, turned over the
videotape to the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department this week. With
the help of Newport Beach detectives, authorities identified the
victim and three alleged attackers, said Sgt. Steve Shulman,
spokesman for the Newport Beach Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't believe the victim was even aware of the assault,"
Shulman said.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County district attorney's office is expected to decide
today whether to charge the three 17-year-old suspects as adults,
spokeswoman Tori Richards said. All three live in San Bernardino
County, as does the girl.</TE>
<TE>   Haidl is one of five assistant sheriffs, reporting directly to
Sheriff Mike Carona. A successful businessman and longtime political
supporter of the sheriff, Haidl oversees the department's 250-person
reserve program and does not take a salary from the county.</TE>
<TE>   Neither he nor his son could be reached for comment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the suspects were arrested in San Bernardino County, and
the third was taken into custody in the 100 block of Jade Cove in
Corona del Mar, the same block where Haidl lives. Two of the arrests
were made Wednesday and one Thursday. Police also searched homes in
Alta Loma and Rancho Cucamonga.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Assistant Sheriff George Jaramillo traveled to the
San Bernardino County sheriff's office in Rancho Cucamonga earlier
this week to inquire about the case.</TE>
<TE>   "Jaramillo responded to try to determine if any member of the
Sheriff's Department was involved in this incident," Amormino said.
"He confirmed that no one from the Sheriff's Department was involved
or under investigation in this incident, and briefed [Carona]
accordingly."</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach police officials said the Sheriff's Department
played no further role in the investigation. Police have determined
that the victim was apparently knocked out after she consumed a drink
laced with an undetermined "date rape" drug, Shulman said.</TE>
<TE>   "We know the girl knows at least one of the [suspects], possibly
more," he said. "That's just another reason why young girls need to
know what they are drinking, to protect any kind of beverage, because
this has become a problem in recent years."</TE>
<TE>   Haidl has served as the assistant sheriff of the reserve division
since 1999. The volunteer reserves perform a variety of duties, from
crisis intervention counseling to search-and-rescue missions.</TE>
<TE>   Before being named assistant sheriff, Haidl, a self-made
millionaire, worked 13 years as a volunteer for the San Bernardino
County Sheriff's Department, where he rose to the rank of captain.</TE>
<TE>   Haidl's appointment to assistant sheriff met with some controversy
because of his business background. He was investigated by Caltrans
and the state attorney general's office in the 1980s over complaints
that his company, Nationwide Auction Systems, underreported how much
it received when it sold state-owned vehicles. No criminal charges
were filed.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Playmate Says She Was Stalked</HD>
<DH>Van Nuys: Anna Nicole Smith testifies at a preliminary
hearing that former boyfriend Mark Hatten threatened her repeatedly
and badly beat up her neighbor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Playboy Playmate Anna Nicole Smith was in court again
Thursday, this time at a preliminary hearing involving an
ex-boyfriend who she said called her repeatedly, came to her house
uninvited and beat up her neighbor after she broke up with him.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very scared of this man because he's crazy," Smith testified
at the hearing for Mark Richmond Hatten in Van Nuys Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   Hatten, 34, of Los Angeles, was ordered to stand trial on July 25
on charges of battery, assault with a deadly weapon, terrorist
threats and stalking from June 2000 to March 2002. If convicted, he
could face seven to eight years in prison.</LD>
<TE>   Smith, 34, testified that she met Hatten, an artist who also
promotes auto dealerships, shortly before the March 2000 Academy
Awards and began a sexual relationship with him "around Oscar time"
that year.</TE>
<TE>   The relationship ended in June 2000 after he approached her with a
knife in the bedroom of her North Hollywood home, Smith said, adding
that she did not call police to report the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Hatten continued to call her, she said, leaving messages on her
home and cell phones several times a day.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, she would find him or items he had left for her inside
her gated property.</TE>
<TE>   Smith testified that on March 25 of this year, Hatten called and
said he was coming over with a gun. He arrived soon after, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was holding my [16-year-old] son and we were just freaking
out," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing for their safety, Smith's personal assistant, Kimberly
Walther, testified that she called a neighbor and asked him to
persuade Hatten to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Rene Navarro, the neighbor, said he tried to talk Hatten into
leaving. Instead, Navarro said Hatten punched him to the ground and
kicked him repeatedly.</TE>
<TE>   Navarro, who wore a cast on his left arm, said he had to have
surgery on hand ligaments that were torn when he tried to block
Hatten's blows.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said she called the police that day and once before when
Hatten showed up at her house and she asked him to leave.</TE>
<TE>   She couldn't remember the date of the earlier incident and said
police did not arrest him at that time.</TE>
<TE>   She said she did not involve the authorities more because she was
in litigation over the estate of her husband, J. Howard Marshall--who
died in 1995 at age 90--and didn't want the negative publicity. Smith
won an $89-million judgment in that case on March 7. Marshall's son,
E. Pierce Marshall, is appealing the award.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Peter Knecht said Smith had a sporadic, two-year
sexual relationship with Hatten, despite Smith's testimony that she
only dated him for only three months.</TE>
<TE>   Knecht said Smith brought charges against Hatten "to silence him.
It's not good for her civil suit." He added, "I don't think she's
interested in these charges. She's interested in her money."</TE>
<TE>   Hatten, who has no prior criminal record, is being held at the
North County Correctional Facility in Saugus in lieu of $300,000
bail.</TE>

<HD>Activists Decry Plan to Bypass Tollway Rules</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES and DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Environmentalists expressed outrage Thursday after learning that
language in a military appropriations bill before Congress would
exempt development of a private toll road from state laws because it
cuts through federal land.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of a proposal by the Transportation Corridor Agencies to
extend the Foothill South tollway through San Clemente to San Onofre
State Beach had backed a state bill that would limit roads in state
parks.</LD>
<LD>   San Onofre State Beach, once part of Camp Pendleton, is leased by
the state from the federal government.</LD>
<TE>   "This is clearly an attempt to go to the federal government to
block any state protections" related to the state beach, said Bill
Corcoran, regional representative for the Sierra Club.</TE>
<TE>   If the language stands, the Foothill South would be exempt from
regulatory oversight by the state Coastal Commission or any laws that
might affect roads through state parks. A bill by state Sen. Sheila
Kuehl (D-Santa Monica) to limit road construction in parks has
stalled in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Corcoran and other activists derided the new language addressing
toll roads in the military authorization bill as "stealth
legislation" because it was slipped into the bill with no fanfare.</TE>
<TE>   But Lisa Telles, a TCA spokeswoman, said the language grew out of
discussions with the TCA, Marine Corps and Department of Defense.</TE>
<TE>   "We intend to follow all laws. Our only intention is to keep all
the alternatives on the table until a final decision is made," Telles
said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the Marines nor the TCA wants state law interfering with
the alternatives now under study, representatives for both have said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the six possible plans for the Foothill South, the Marines
prefer the route that goes through San Onofre because it interferes
the least with Camp Pendleton. Last year, Rep. Darrell E. Issa
(R-Vista) introduced similar language into a House bill, but it was
deleted.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Riverside) reinserted the exemption
on behalf of the TCA and Marine Corps, a spokesman from Calvert's
office said.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Evans, executive director of Surfrider Foundation, one of
the opponents of Foothill South, said the exemption "is an outrage."</TE>
<TE>   "To see them slip this through in the dark of the night tells you
all you need to know about the TCA. It's sad ... I can't believe it,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Debate on the appropriations measure continues in Congress. It
includes budget items on homeland security and major military
projects. The section containing the toll road is not expected to be
taken up until after Labor Day, an Appropriations Committee spokesman
said.</TE>

before her body was dumped in the alley. "It's a pretty macabre crime
scene," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Detectives were searching for the rest of the body, and said they
still did not know where or how the woman died or who she was.</TE>

<HD>W. Van Tongerloo, 98; Among Last Titanic Survivors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Winnifred Quick Van Tongerloo never forgot April 14-15, 1912, the
night the Titanic struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic and sank,
after breaking in half, about 2 1/2 hours later.</LD>
<LD>   Of the approximately 2,200 passengers and crew members on the
ship's maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City,
only 705 survived, most of them women and children. Van Tongerloo was
one of them.</LD>
<LD>   "It has stayed with me," she said in a 1987 interview. "No more
water experiences for me."</LD>
<TE>   Van Tongerloo, one of four remaining Titanic survivors, died July
4 of congestive heart failure at a hospital in East Lansing, Mich.
She was 98.</TE>
<TE>   One known survivor of the disaster now remains in the United
States and two in Britain, all of them women, according to the
Titanic Historical Society.</TE>
<TE>   Van Tongerloo was 8 years old when she, her 2-year-old sister,
Phyllis, and their mother, Jane Quick, left their home in Plymouth,
England, and boarded the Titanic, the largest and most luxurious
ocean liner of its time.</TE>
<TE>   Their eventual destination was Detroit, where Van Tongerloo's
father, Frederick, already had established a home for his family and
found work as a plasterer, said Van Tongerloo's daughter, Jeanette
Happel, who heard the story of the Titanic disaster primarily from
her grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my mother was just a private person and didn't like a lot
of attention, where my grandmother was more outgoing," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Quicks had retired to their stateroom about 9 p.m. and were
sound asleep when the ship struck the iceberg, about 11:40 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   A female passenger knocked on their door, which Jane Quick had
left ajar to help alleviate the smell of fresh paint, and told them
there had been an accident. The woman said the family should get
dressed and go up on deck.</TE>
<TE>   Happel said her grandmother got out of bed and put a skirt on over
her nightclothes and then woke up her older daughter. But she wasn't
in a hurry.</TE>
<TE>   When Quick had asked if the accident was serious, the woman had
said no.</TE>
<TE>   But then a steward appeared at the door and yelled: "For God's
sake, get up! Don't stop to dress. Just put on your life jackets.
They've hit an iceberg, and the ship is sinking."</TE>
<TE>   "I remember the steward knocking on our cabin door and telling us
to come up on deck because something had happened," Van Tongerloo
told United Press International in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   When a life jacket was put on her, she recalled, she thought she
would have to jump into the frigid water.</TE>
<TE>   "I was horrified," she recalled. "That wasn't the case, but being
a child, that's what I felt."</TE>
<TE>   Van Tongerloo and her sister were loaded into one of the
lifeboats. And, just as her mother was about to join the two girls, a
crew member announced: "That's enough. No more."</TE>
<TE>   But Quick protested that she wouldn't be separated from her
children, and room was made for her.</TE>
<TE>   After they were rowed to safety away from the ship, Van Tongerloo
remembered, "We heard the boilers breaking and saw the lights going
out. We also heard the people screaming.</TE>
<TE>   "As the years go by, these things fade. But that's something you
couldn't forget. It was too bad, too terrible to forget."</TE>
<TE>   The British liner Carpathia, arrived at the site about 4 a.m. and
picked up the survivors. When the ship docked in New York, Van
Tongerloo's father was there to meet his family.</TE>
<TE>   Van Tongerloo spent the remainder of her childhood in Detroit,
married, had five children and later moved to Warren, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   An honorary member of the Titanic Historical Society, she was
preceded in death by her sister Phyllis, who, Happel was told, slept
through the entire ordeal.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Happel, Van Tongerloo is survived by another
daughter, Gloria Tuck; a son, Jack; a sister, Virginia Nantais; nine
grandchildren; 16 great-grandchildren; and five
great-great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>John Wallach, 59; Foreign Correspondent, Peace Activist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Wallach, a foreign correspondent whose views of Middle East
violence inspired him to start a camp for teenagers from warring
lands, died Wednesday of lung cancer at his home in New York City. He
was 59.</LD>
<LD>   As the foreign editor for Hearst Newspapers from 1968 to 1994,
Wallach broke several stories related to the Iran-Contra affair and
the CIA's covert mining of Nicaraguan waters. He received the
National Press Club's highest honor.</LD>
<LD>   But it was for his work with Seeds of Peace that he was awarded
the United Nations' UNESCO Peace Prize in 1996 and was honored by
Jordan's King Hussein with the Legion of Honor of the Hashemite
kingdom.</LD>
<TE>   "With the Seeds of Peace, John pierced the future, because he
concluded that today's adults were not succeeding in finding a peace
process. And he thought maybe it'll be the next generation that'll
make it," said CNN commentator Bernard Kalb, who covered the State
Department alongside Wallach.</TE>
<TE>   The 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center inspired Wallach to
give up journalism and propose that Israeli, Egyptian and Palestinian
youths meet at a camp on neutral soil: the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "I was disturbed by the dehumanization of the Palestinians,"
Wallach, the son of German Jews, told students at Middlebury College
in Vermont in 1999. "After all, the Jews were dehumanized by the
Nazis. That made it easier to kill them."</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli and Egyptian governments and officials of the
Palestine Liberation Organization agreed to Wallach's plan, and each
summer since 1993, the Maine woods have welcomed hundreds of Arab and
Israeli teenagers who meet their so-called enemies.</TE>
<TE>   Seeds now has 1,600 graduates from about 20 violence-torn lands.
This summer it is hosting 450 children and 75 adults from 22
countries, including, for the first time, Afghanistan. India and
Pakistan were added last year.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few of the campers are from the United States. The
participants come largely from conflict-ridden nations where children
are taught to distrust outside cultures.</TE>
<TE>   The camp, which Wallach once described as "a detox program for the
hatreds we all possess," encourages dialogue and understanding by
pairing supposed enemies. Over three weeks, often marked by painful
confrontations, participants learn about the historical reasons for
the animosities in their regions and realize that they "still need to
accept each other" despite the hatred.</TE>
<TE>   "What Seeds of Peace is about," Wallach told "60 Minutes" in 1998,
"is beginning to think for yourself, and that's not easy."</TE>
<TE>   Wallach also wrote several books, including "The Selling of Fidel
Castro" in 1985 and "The New Palestinians: The Emerging Generation of
Leaders" in 1992. He frequently collaborated with his wife, Janet
Wallach, his co-author on the 1988 book "Still Small Voices: The
Human Story Behind the Intifada."</TE>
<TE>   The latter work profiled a cross-section of residents from the
West Bank and Gaza, including a Jewish survivor of the Holocaust and
an Islamic fundamentalist. Critics praised the book for the same
reasons that Seeds of Peace won admirers, as proof of the potential
of individuals to resolve conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   "I honestly believe in that shop-worn maxim that one person can
make a difference," he told Contemporary Authors several years ago.
"I hope that my career has helped end some of the dehumanization and
stereotypes around us, and that in the process there is a little less
hate."</TE>
