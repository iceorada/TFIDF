<HD>Leaky Torpedo Fuel Caused Kursk Disaster, Russia Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Leaking torpedo propellant caused the explosion that sank the Kursk
nuclear submarine nearly two years ago, killing its 118-man crew in
what Russia's top prosecutor on Friday called a technical malfunction
for which no one was to blame.</LD>
<LD>   Closing the books on one of Russia's worst post-Soviet disasters,
Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov also defended the Kremlin's
handling of the rescue efforts and said no evidence was found to back
up allegations that a collision with a Western submarine or a World
War II mine could have been at fault. Ustinov said all the sailors
aboard died within eight hours of the Kursk's sinking in the Barents
Sea on Aug. 12, 2000--long before any help could have arrived.</LD>
<LD>   When the navy located the submarine on the seabed some 30 hours
after the catastrophe, "there was already no chance to save anyone,"
Ustinov said.</LD>
<TE>   He spoke after reporting his verdict to President Vladimir Putin,
saying the accident had been triggered by a leak of highly unstable
hydrogen peroxide that exploded after contact with kerosene and the
metal body of the torpedo.</TE>

<HD>Apes Are Endangered, Exotic--and For Sale</HD>
<DH>Environment: Nigeria is one of the world's most flagrant
illegal markets for Africa's primates and other threatened species.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENN McKENZIE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>CALABAR, Nigeria</DL>
<LD>Milk bottles at the ready, Irene Okon Edem cradles two wide-eyed
orphans in her arms while a third hangs precociously on her neck.</LD>
<LD>   "Stop it," the 23-year-old Nigerian gently scolds one of them,
named Buster, who then bites his lip and tugs her hair mischievously.</LD>
<LD>   Buster is a chimpanzee, delivered in April to Edem and fellow
workers at the Drill Ranch, a private American-run primate sanctuary
in Nigeria, which conservationists say is one of the world's most
flagrant illegal markets for Africa's endangered apes.</LD>
<TE>   A woman had bought Buster out of pity, rescuing the baby chimp
from smugglers. Other primates have turned up at the Drill Ranch in
the eastern Nigeria city of Calabar with cigarette burns or shotgun
wounds.</TE>
<TE>   Looking for an illegal, exotic pet? Go no farther than the Musa
Yar A'Adua Center, a marble memorial in the capital to honor a past
junta figure.</TE>
<TE>   Animal traders set up shop in a scrubby field across the street.
Affluent customers choose among endangered apes and other animals
captured in the wild, seeking trophies for public and private zoos
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Young men watch over dirty cages and nylon mesh bags filled with
some of the world's most threatened species -- fish eagles, for
instance, or gray parrots, prized as good talkers.</TE>
<TE>   Got any apes? A trader named Habib Sani pulls an emaciated baby
chimpanzee out of a perforated plastic sack. The price: 60,000 naira,
or about $500.</TE>
<TE>   Unaccustomed to bright sunlight, the baby chimp shields its eyes
with tiny hands.</TE>
<TE>   Even gorillas, which number just 100 in a forest fringe on
Nigeria's eastern border, can be ordered for the right price,
whispers Sani.</TE>
<TE>   In Nigeria, a West African nation of 120 million, decades of
intensive hunting have denuded forests and savannas of wildlife. But
its cities remain marketplaces for exotic species, alive or dead,
from nearby Cameroon, Chad, Sierra Leone, Liberia and the Central
African Republic. Conservationists say commercial trapping in those
countries is an offshoot of the more traditional, and more
indiscriminate, trade in hunted meat.</TE>
<TE>   At the Lekki tourist market in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial
capital, an American businessman gazes at Sahara Desert foxes, cranes
and parrots pawing and scratching at their plywood cages. "An Old
McDonald's farm," he mutters.</TE>
<TE>   Live apes and rare birds are sometimes seen on sale just outside
Nigeria's international airports.</TE>
<TE>   Great apes, humans' closest animal relatives, once ranged from
Senegal on Africa's western tip to Tanzania in the east.</TE>
<TE>   They survive today only in isolated pockets of dwindling forests
-- perhaps just 100,000 chimpanzees and far fewer gorillas,
scientists estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Hunting or trapping great apes is banned by the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species, a global treaty that
Nigeria has signed.</TE>
<TE>   But the accord hasn't stopped trafficking networks from capturing
chimpanzees, bonobos and their giant cousins, African gorillas, and
smuggling them through borders and airports to zoos and private
collectors overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Most takers are in Asia, the Middle East and eastern Europe, says
Shirley McGreal, chairwoman of the Summerville, S.C.-based
International Primate Protection League.</TE>
<TE>   McGreal showed Associated Press a letter from a Nigerian firm
offering to sell four baby gorillas for $400,000 each to a private
Middle Eastern zoo. The league whited out the zoo's name for legal
reasons.</TE>
<TE>   The profits from smuggling are huge. A chimp sold for $10 in an
African village would fetch $20,000 in Moscow or Dubai. Nigeria is a
key transit point, conservationists say, because officials here often
plead ignorance of bans or deliberately overlook violations.</TE>
<TE>   "We often have to show police and officials photocopies of laws,"
says Muhtari Aminu-Kanu, executive director of the Nigeria
Conservation Foundation. "Once they have seen that, they are usually
helpful."</TE>
<TE>   The plight of Africa's primates gained prominence in September
when a baby gorilla and baby chimpanzee arrived at Cairo's airport on
a flight from Nigeria without proper export and import documents.</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian veterinarians drowned them in a vat of chemicals, saying
they feared they were carrying diseases.</TE>
<TE>   In January, conservationists were alerted when four baby gorillas
from Nigeria turned up at Malaysia's Taiping Zoo.</TE>
<TE>   The government-funded zoo denied any impropriety, saying it was
told the apes were bred in captivity in Nigeria and therefore could
be legally traded.</TE>
<TE>   Conservationists say there is no known breeding program in all of
Africa from which gorillas could have come.</TE>
<TE>   Export documents seen by AP list the gorillas as having been bred
at Nigeria's University of Ibadan Zoological Gardens, 75 miles north
of Lagos. Employees there say they have no breeding program. The only
gorilla on display is a 37-year-old female long past breeding age.</TE>
<TE>   Olalekan Akanji, a keeper at the Ibadan zoo, said the four
gorillas now in Malaysia "came from the jungle in Cameroon" and spent
several months at his zoo. Akanji said he bottle-fed them milk and
sugar water, and even taught one to ride a tricycle.</TE>
<TE>   Another zoo employee, Friday Ndubisi Onwuka, gave a similar
account.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the zoo ever had other baby gorillas intended for
trade, Akanji said, "Yes, there have been many. But a lot of them
died."</TE>
<TE>   "If anyone else wants more gorillas, we can get some more," Akanji
volunteered. "But they are very expensive."</TE>
<TE>   The zoo administration said the director was not available for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Export documents for two of the infant gorillas -- named Abbey and
Alice -- bear the signature of the permanent secretary of Nigeria's
Ministry of Environment, D.B. Usman.</TE>
<TE>   Usman did not return messages seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Nigeria's environment minister, Muhammad Sa'id, says officials are
investigating the possibility that the gorillas' export documents may
have been forged. He blames rampant wildlife smuggling on the
"activities of some unpatriotic Nigerians and their foreign
conspirators."</TE>
<TE>   McGreal, of the International Primate Protection League, contends
the gorillas "could not legitimately have been captive-bred."
Nigerian conservationists agree.</TE>
<TE>   Smugglers often buy primates from hunters, who shoot the adults
for food and profit and capture the surviving infants, said John
Oates, a British-born primatologist living part-time in Nigeria.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony E. Bassey, a Nigeria Conservation Foundation official,
says modern wire snares and traps have replaced traditional hunting
methods and have worsened the odds against endangered primates.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of habitat through road-building and logging has further
depleted their numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "Our primates need better protection, but how?" Bassey asked.
"It's a race against time."</TE>
<TE>   In the decade since he was orphaned at 15 and forced to quit
school and fend for himself, Edet Asuquo Edet has hunted in the rain
forests surrounding Oban, a town near Nigeria's eastern border with
Cameroon.</TE>
<TE>   Once, the pickings were plenty, Edet says, but these days it can
take days or weeks to find a few small monkeys or bush rats to sell
as food to tribespeople.</TE>
<TE>   Edet says he almost never sees gorillas these days. Occasionally,
he bags a rarity -- a chimpanzee.</TE>
<TE>   In April, he shot a male nsimbo, or drill -- a majestic
pink-and-red animal, baboon-sized and listed among the international
trade convention's endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   Although he insists he never does it himself, Edet says he knows
hunters who have captured the live young of adult animals they have
killed and sold them to traders who whisk them off to the cities.</TE>
<TE>   "We know the monkeys only to eat, but some people like to keep the
little ones because they live like human beings," Edet explained.</TE>
<TE>   At the Drill Ranch, run by Liza Gadsby and Peter Jenkins, from
Portland, Ore., keeper Okon Edem believes the only hope is to educate
Africa's youngsters about the apes' value as "ecological treasures."
So she is especially keen to get the message out to a party of
visiting schoolchildren who watch in fascination as the three baby
chimps climb over her.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people say it should be acceptable in Nigeria to hunt these
animals to eat or sell, but that was in the past," Edem tells them.
"Now they are disappearing into extinction."</TE>
<TE>   She admits it is hard to persuade poor people to "love monkeys
when they see orphaned children not getting any care."</TE>
<TE>   Bassey, the Nigerian conservation official, says folk tales of
hunters battling chimpanzees with makeshift swords have fostered a
perception among villagers that primates are "the enemy of humanity."</TE>
<TE>   However, Bassey says, even some hunters change their minds when
they see drills or chimpanzees nursing their young, and vow never to
hunt the animals again.</TE>
<TE>   "When you see chimp babies at their mothers' breasts, you relate
to them as social beings," he says. "Wildlife is not just about
jungle life."</TE>

<HD>Tehran Residents Quake at Idea of Big Temblor</HD>
<DH>Seismology: Although the capital has not been the site of a
major temblor, many believe that devastation would be extensive if
one hits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALI AKBAR DAREINI</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEHRAN</DL>
<LD>The most recent earthquake to hit quake-prone Iran shook five
provinces, flattened villages, killed 245 people -- and left
residents of Iran's capital and population center wondering fearfully
what would happen if Tehran were next.</LD>
<LD>   In the days after the magnitude 6 quake hit last month southwest
of Tehran, newspapers in this city of 10 million sounded the alarm,
saying the officials responsible for emergency response had done next
to nothing to prepare for a major quake -- which the city has never
suffered.</LD>
<LD>   "The condition of our emergency response facilities and
infrastructures such as hospitals, police and firefighting stations,
as well as utilities like the natural gas networks and the main
electricity grid, are so unsound that experts predict they will be
among some of the first structures to be destroyed," the
English-language daily Iran News warned.</LD>
<TE>   Next came criticism from the Tehran City Council, whose members
seize any chance to pick on the bureaucracy that runs the capital.</TE>
<TE>   The council adopted a plan by member Ebrahim Asgharzadeh to
respond to what he called official lapses. He proposed identifying
buildings too weak to withstand a major quake and strengthening them,
enhancing building inspections and improving construction standards.
Although the plan was approved in principle, details on how it will
be implemented have yet to be worked out.</TE>
<TE>   Asgharzadeh says that Tehran's building industry was "corrupt" and
that municipal authorities would have to take more responsibility
over "supervision of building construction" to prevent the use of
shoddy materials that save contractors money.</TE>
<TE>   New regulations, especially with no clear plan for implementing
them, may not be the answer. Since 1986, buildings in Tehran have had
to be engineered to resist quakes of up to magnitude 7, the point at
which a temblor is considered capable of widespread, heavy damage.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say there is reason to be concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "Our scientific data suggest that the earthquake faults in Tehran
are very active and moving," said Nasrollah Kamalian, the head of
Tehran University's Geophysics Institute. "There is a 95% possibility
of a magnitude 6 or more devastating quake in Tehran, but the timing
cannot be predicted."</TE>
<TE>   Seismologist Muhammad Mokhtari said that Tehran has grown in
recent decades and that some new neighborhoods are atop fault lines.</TE>
<TE>   He said a quake in Tehran, in the Alborz mountain range, could
kill about a million people within a few minutes. Extensive fires
sparked by explosion of gas pipes and flooding due to broken water
pipes would add to the devastation, the seismologist said.</TE>
<TE>   In June 1990, a quake measuring between magnitude 7.3 and 7.7
destroyed Roudbar and other smaller towns in northern Iran, killing
45,000 people and leaving 10 times as many homeless. In May 1997, a
magnitude 7.1 quake killed 1,500 people, again in the country's
north. Both quakes hit about 125 miles from Tehran, where they were
felt but caused no damage.</TE>
<TE>   "On the average, Iran has seen a devastating quake once every
decade," Kamalian said. "The time is ripe for another disaster now
after the 1990 quake." Mohsen Ghafouri Ashtiyani, head of the
International Seismology Institute in Tehran, said the effects of a
quake would be compounded by the poor construction.</TE>

<HD>Afghans Dig In Amid Drought</HD>
<DH>Weather: The country's driest stretch in three decades
heads into its fourth year. Wells are being sunk deeper and deeper in
search of water.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK QUINN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Abdul Baqi says the "flower" is very difficult to find these days,
its life-bearing "root" buried deep beneath the harsh sands and dry,
packed earth.</LD>
<LD>   That flower is the moisture that seeps from the upper layers of
the water table, the 27-year-old well-driller explains. The root is
the deeper, water-rich layer.</LD>
<LD>   Afghanistan's worst drought in three decades has begun its fourth
year. The lack of water has withered farms famous for raisins and
pomegranates and devastated herds of nomadic tribes. People must trek
for miles carrying plastic jugs over their shoulders to get water at
hand-pumped wells.</LD>
<TE>   The American National Ground Water Assn. says the water table in
some southern Afghanistan provinces is at an all-time low. Aid groups
estimate that more than half of the country's 25 million people are
short of water.</TE>
<TE>   The south has been hit hardest. Already arid, at least three of
the five southern provinces -- Kandahar, Helmand and Nimroz -- show
signs of turning into deserts.</TE>
<TE>   Before the drought, Baqi's family-run operation dug just a few
wells each year. In the last three years, it has dug 300.</TE>
<TE>   "Without water there is no sign of life. You can see slowly,
slowly that the green is finishing. If the drought continues, life
will also finish," Baqi said.</TE>
<TE>   Baqi is digging a well near the mountain slopes on the edge of a
desert plain outside Kandahar. He hopes it will provide enough water
for a small manufacturing business, but the task is becoming
increasingly difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "We dig 100 meters [330 feet] so far and no water," he said.
"Three years ago, the flower was at five meters and the root at 20
meters. Now the flower is at 30 meters and the root at least 100
meters."</TE>
<TE>   International organizations -- even the U.S. Army -- are digging
or planning hundreds of wells around the south.</TE>
<TE>   Among the people suffering the most are the Kuchi, nomadic
herdsmen thought to make up about 3% of Afghans. "There are estimates
that they have lost up to 70% of their livestock," said Nigel Pont,
program officer for the aid group Mercy Corps.</TE>
<TE>   In a semi-barren field near Kandahar, 60-year-old Hai Abdul Jabar
tends nine scraggly sheep. "Before, I was a rich man with more than
300 sheep.... Now I am forced to beg for work in the city," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Kuchi herder moved about 60 miles over the last two years to
get closer to the city.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Manan, 47, is an "ab shanaas" -- or water finder, the Afghan
version of a dowser. He now has three to four customers daily, mostly
farmers. Before, he had at most one customer a week.</TE>
<TE>   With water so hard to find, Manan says he sometimes fails.</TE>
<TE>   "Farmers are suffering the most; their orchards are dying," he
said. "This is a very bad time and I pray to God for rain."</TE>

<HD>Pacific Northwest Rocked by Methamphetamines</HD>

<AU>MATTHEW DALY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Five Pacific Northwest residents graduated this month, but they
didn't wear caps and gowns.</LD>
<LD>   The five--four "meth moms" and a dad--are all recovering
methamphetamine addicts, and their graduation was held in a Tacoma,
Wash., courtroom, where a judge pronounced their completion of a
yearlong treatment program.</LD>
<LD>   They hope to go on and lead productive lives now that they've
finished the program--one of many funded by the federal government to
help meth users kick a habit that counselors say is harder to shake
than heroin.</LD>
<TE>   "These people are not felons," said Terree Schmidt-Whelan,
executive director of the Pierce County Alliance, which runs the
treatment program. "They're in here to try to help them get their
kids back and work toward getting a job."</TE>
<TE>   Graduation by itself does not guarantee the addicts custody of
their children--taken from them because they were deemed incapable of
providing adequate care. But it greatly increases chances for the
program's 84 participants, Schmidt-Whelan said.</TE>
<TE>   The $422,000 program is part of the Washington State
Methamphetamine Initiative, a consortium of social service, law
enforcement and community organizations that has so far received $4
million in federal money to address a problem that has reached
epidemic proportions.</TE>
<TE>   California, Washington and Oregon are ranked among the five worst
states in the country in terms of methamphetamine use and production,
according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,800 meth labs were seized in California last year,
including 235 high-quantity "superlabs." Seizures in the Golden State
were second only to Missouri, and the number of superlabs seized in
California far exceeded any other state.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers are almost as grim for Washington and Oregon. Nearly
1,500 meth labs were seized in Washington last year--third-greatest
in the nation--and 584 labs were seized in Oregon, the fifth-greatest
in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The drug problem is so severe that last year, two dozen lawmakers,
including Rep. Brian Baird (D-Wash.), formed the bipartisan
Congressional Caucus to Fight and Control Methamphetamine. The group
now includes 88 of the 435 House members.</TE>
<TE>   For as little as $10, a meth user can get a more euphoric high
than cocaine and one that lasts a long time--from one to three days,
said Baird, a clinical psychologist who treated meth addicts before
being elected to Congress in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   While the drug is imported into the region from Mexico and other
countries, it is also widely manufactured, or "cooked," in the
Pacific Northwest in vans, motels and, increasingly, in forests.
Ingredients are extracted from over-the-counter items such as the
cold medicine pseudoephedrine, and recipes are widely available on
the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   To combat the problem, officials have devised a three-pronged
approach that includes law enforcement, treatment and prevention.
Funding for the Washington state meth initiative, for instance, was
doubled, from $2 million in 2000 to $4 million for the current fiscal
year.</TE>
<TE>   In Oregon, Democratic Rep. Darlene Hooley recently helped win
approval of a $580,000 federal grant to fight meth in Marion County.
She helped arrange a helicopter tour of Oregon this spring by DEA
chief Asa Hutchinson and White House drug czar John Walters.</TE>
<TE>   The flight over a busted meth lab near Gervais showed how
difficult it is for police to stop meth production, Hooley said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at it from the air, it looks like it's just another
house. That's what makes it so scary," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon's high-intensity drug-trafficking program, or HIDTA--which
focuses on methamphetamine, heroin and other drugs--received $2.5
million in federal money last year, but Hooley and other lawmakers
say more resources are needed.</TE>
<TE>   "People who use methamphetamine become paranoid, delusional and
sometimes violent," Hooley said.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Karl, executive director of the Oregon program, requested
a $1.5-million increase for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 to
allow the state to expand the three-county drug-trafficking area.</TE>
<TE>   The Oregon program only got an increase of $250,000, which Karl
said is too small to fund expansion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frustrating," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, officials have requested about $630,000 to expand
the seven-county program area.</TE>
<TE>   No decision has been made, but Baird said there's "a high
probability" it will happen.</TE>
<TE>   The meth caucus was instrumental in increasing overall funding for
the program by $20 million, so it makes sense to use that money where
caucus members believe it is needed, Baird said.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Rodriguez, director of the Northwest HIDTA program, based in
Seattle, said any expansion must be approved by the White House drug
office.</TE>
<TE>   Even without expansion, the existing program, which stretches from
the northern border to Olympia and Yakima, Wash., targets more than
half the state, Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   But Baird said more must be done.</TE>
<TE>   "We spend a billion dollars fighting cocaine in Colombia," he
said. "But here we have a drug being produced in our own backyard,
and we're not spending nearly enough as we should."</TE>

<HD>Wilderness 'Matriarch' Sows the Seeds of Conservation</HD>
<DH>Environment: Pioneering activist Mardy Murie believes
natural areas have a higher purpose than mere repositories of oil and
gas deposits: They nourish the soul.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BECKY BOHRER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyo.</DL>
<LD>Strangers still find their way to Margaret Murie's log cabin at the
end of a gravel road.</LD>
<LD>   Some have read books that she wrote decades ago; others have heard
stories of her long career as a conservation activist. All hope to
meet the woman known as Mardy, considered by many the mother of the
modern wilderness movement.</LD>
<LD>   "I have seen people walk away from visiting with her as though
they had been visiting a shrine," says son Donald. "Even now, stuck
in a wheelchair and not always entirely with it, she has a force of
personality that is very effective."</LD>
<TE>   Bill Meadows, head of the Wilderness Society, says, "There are a
handful of people we count among our legendary heroes. Within the
wilderness family, Mardy is still considered the matriarch."</TE>
<TE>   Murie turns 100 on Aug. 18 and still lives within Grand Teton
National Park on the ranch that first became a center for the
conservation and wilderness community in the 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   This is where her late husband, Olaus, established an office when
he took a lead role with the Wilderness Society.</TE>
<TE>   On the front porch of the modest cabin, tucked under towering
evergreens and just minutes from the crush of tourists, the Muries
used to meet with conservation and scientific luminaries and helped
sow the seeds of what became the federal Wilderness Act.</TE>
<TE>   Mardy Murie served both as hostess -- she was a great cook with a
keen sense of humor -- and secretary. She also was known to speak her
mind, friends say.</TE>
<TE>   Olaus Murie died in 1963. Age and illness have slowly robbed Mardy
Murie of the enthusiasm with which she once greeted even unannounced
visitors to the ranch. The tradition of cookies and conversation has
been retired.</TE>
<TE>   Caretakers look after her now, sometimes turning away visitors.
Wilderness activists and other friends make sure that Murie's bills
are paid, that her cabin is maintained and that her needs are met.</TE>
<TE>   And they say they are determined to make sure the movement
continues long after her death.</TE>
<TE>   An education center, a conservation think tank, is planned on the
ranch to raise a new generation of wilderness advocates.</TE>
<TE>   Renovation is underway on the ranch's historic cabins and
outbuildings, designated a national historic district and bequeathed
to the National Park Service when Murie dies.</TE>
<TE>   Mardy Murie's life as a conservationist began in earnest after she
and Olaus married in 1924. The two embarked on a life of travel and
scientific exploration.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Olaus worked as a biologist with state and federal
agencies, exploring unmapped areas and studying wildlife. His work
led them to Alaska, and they were credited with helping preserve the
area now known as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from oil and
gas development.</TE>
<TE>   They reared three children, although Donald Murie, now 70, says
his parents never let child-rearing get in the way of their quest.</TE>
<TE>   "When they went off to do a study for a week or two, we went along
and slept on the ground in tents," says Donald Murie, who lives in
Palm Springs. "A lot of times we resented it. They were good parents,
but we always realized this work they were doing was No. 1."</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, his mother's lifelong conservation work won her the
Presidential Medal of Freedom. But Mardy Murie anguished over her
role in the conservation movement after her husband's death.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would have been hard for her to do anything after
that," says close friend Inger Koedt, 87. "But it was important for
her to have an influence."</TE>
<TE>   Often, her biggest influence was on those who followed the narrow
road to her cabin and had cookies with her. Friends say she relished
sharing her experiences with visitors in hopes of engaging them in
the fight to preserve wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a higher purpose for these lands than oil and gas
development, she figured. There is a soul purpose," says Louisa
Wilcox, a conservationist from Bozeman, Mont., who has known Murie
for 20 years. "She made you think a lot about your own motivation: Is
your heart pure? Hers was."</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Hamilton, national conservation director for the Sierra
Club, says the wilderness movement has not lost its passion or its
goal. It simply has become far broader and more diverse in the issues
and politics involved.</TE>
<TE>   Meadows agrees, and he adds that there is plenty to learn today
from such early wilderness warriors as Murie -- including a better
understanding of opposing views.</TE>
<TE>   "We've let politics influence our arguments more than we should,"
he says. "And we should look at ways to build bridges. Some believe
there is a need to move away from the political campaign of the 20th
century and to a spiritual campaign of the 21st century."</TE>
<TE>   That emotion -- connectiveness -- is what Murie got across and
what Wilcox says inspired activists like her: "She related to
wilderness as a beautiful, spiritual place that we needed more of for
our soul."</TE>

<HD>Post Office Still Shut for Anthrax</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURIE KELLMAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The huge mail processing center in the nation's capital that was
tainted by anthrax in the fall probably won't reopen before 2003,
postal officials told House lawmakers Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Even after the 17-million-cubic-foot facility receives a clean
bill of health as early as next fall, it will be closed for
renovation for several additional months, one official said.</LD>
<LD>   "The fact that the building is decontaminated of anthrax does not
mean that we open the doors," Thomas Day, vice president for
engineering for the postal service, told the House Subcommittee on
the District of Columbia.</LD>
<TE>   Even when it does open, it probably will not have new technology
to sense and disperse biological hazards. Mail, Day said, would
continue to be irradiated for anthrax.</TE>
<TE>   The facility, which handled most mail for the capital, was shut
down after last fall's anthrax mail attacks left two postal workers
dead and thousands receiving preventive treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The Brentwood facility processed an anthrax-filled letter sent to
Capitol Hill, but officials were not immediately aware of the extent
of the contamination. They initially allowed work to continue there
-- even holding a news conference with top managers to try to ease
workers' concerns. But the building was soon shuttered and about
2,500 workers were relocated.</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing on the Gallaudet University campus, Day said tests
planned for Monday on how well the Brentwood facility is sealed are
only the beginning of a long process.</TE>
<TE>   After the test, to see whether or not chlorine dioxide gas could
escape, results must be processed and issued to the community.</TE>
<TE>   The facility will be decontaminated over several days.</TE>
<TE>   Brentwood will then be tested for anthrax, and the results
analyzed over several weeks. The community must be informed of them.</TE>
<TE>   Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) sought assurances from the
panel that the cleanup is done as thoroughly as in the Hart Senate
Office Building, where the tainted letter was opened.</TE>
<TE>   "... I say, do it slow but do it right," Norton said.</TE>

<HD>Posh City Clubs Loosen Their Ties to Stay Alive</HD>
<DH>Culture: As membership drops in elite institutions, new
enticements are offered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA COOK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The banquet room boasts a fireplace big enough to hold an SUV.
Hallways are decorated with sepia-toned prints by the renowned
photographer Edward Curtis, who used them to pay his membership bills
a century ago. Even the sunlight filtering through the tall windows
seems elegant and refined.</LD>
<LD>   You know you've made it in Seattle society when you're invited to
join the exclusive Rainier Club. Local legend says more business
deals have been struck behind the club's stately brick walls than in
any office in the city.</LD>
<LD>   So, the pony in the lobby stuck out a bit.</LD>
<TE>   This spring's Easter egg hunt required some special entertainment
for the children, and that's why a pony was brought in.</TE>
<TE>   "And everything that comes with a pony," Michael Troyer, chief
operating officer of the 114-year-old club said, arching one eyebrow.</TE>
<TE>   The scene would have been unthinkable 30 years ago, when children
and barn animals were equally unwelcome.</TE>
<TE>   But changes are brewing at America's posh private city clubs, the
urban cousins of country clubs in the suburbs. Struggling to stay
alive in a business-casual world, exclusive city clubs are loosening
their ties, slashing fees and shaking up traditions.</TE>
<TE>   "It took a while for a lot of clubs to wake up that they really
need to be competitive," said James Burns, general manager of the
Union Club of Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "Membership just sort of happened" in the old days, Burns said.
"Now it's a whole different ballgame."</TE>
<TE>   Private city clubs offer fine dining in luxurious settings to
those who can afford the $1,000 to $2,000 initiation fee, plus
hundreds of dollars in monthly dues, plus meal expenses. Most
important, they offer members the warm feeling of belonging to an
exclusive club where the staff always knows who you are, what you
drink and how you like your steak.</TE>
<TE>   About 500,000 people are members at city clubs, according to the
Club Managers Assn. of America.</TE>
<TE>   But despite the perks they offer, city clubs are losing 12% of
members annually, according to Dallas-based club consultant Rick
Coyne. Older members are dying off, and prospective new members often
forgo city club membership in favor of country clubs, expensive
vacations or a host of other amusements.</TE>
<TE>   "Young people today don't see private clubs the same way their
fathers did, or certainly as their grandfathers did," Coyne said.</TE>
<TE>   Clubs still want to preserve traditions, he said, "but unless you
listen to what the market is telling you, you're not going to be
around."</TE>
<TE>   These days, clubs know they must provide fun for the whole family
if they want to keep dues-payers happy. Which explains the pony in
Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the kind of thing that seems to click these
days--everyone's so busy," explained Rainier Club President Jay
Rockey, a member for 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Change started knocking on private club doors during the 1970s,
when lawsuits challenged long-standing policies that prevented many
people from joining. Many clubs excluded women and nonwhites from
membership. The doors opened for good in 1988, when the U.S. Supreme
Court upheld a New York law banning discrimination by private clubs.
(Though no industry group offers race and gender breakdowns,
observers say clubs remain largely white and male.)</TE>
<TE>   Club managers recall the 1980s fondly. Business was good, and the
opulent image of private clubs meshed with the style of the
status-conscious decade. City club fortunes reversed in the 1990s.
Even as the surging popularity of golf boosted private country club
membership in the last decade , city clubs suffered one blow after
another.</TE>
<TE>   Tax laws changed in the mid-1990s so that club dues and many club
expenses are no longer tax deductible. At the same time, companies
cut back on club memberships. Corporations paid for most club
memberships two decades ago, but now only 20% of memberships are
corporate-held, according to Kathy O'Neal, senior vice president of
Dallas-based Club Corp., which owns 200 private clubs worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Now that members are spending their own money, clubs must work
harder than ever to woo and keep them.</TE>
<TE>   That's why R.J. Ballanca, manager of San Francisco's City Club,
tracks his members with a computer database--women business leaders,
wine buffs, architecture aficionados--and he tailors events
accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, he waived the usual $1,000 initiation fee in favor
of a $100 donation to charity--one of many clubs offering similar
deals. Ballanca said his biggest obstacle in recruiting new members
is overcoming the "martini-swilling, cigar-smoking geezers" image
left over from the club's previous incarnation as the old Pacific
Stock Exchange Lunch Club.</TE>
<TE>   Some clubs have taken radical steps to shed their old-geezer
image.</TE>
<TE>   When Dave Rosen became general manager of the downtown Denver Club
in 1998, employees usually outnumbered members in the dining room.
The club dumped its formal dining rooms and ballrooms and reopened as
a stripped-down, yet still posh, athletic club.</TE>
<TE>   "The days of the 48-ounce porterhouse and Caesar salad for lunch
are gone," Rosen declared. "I don't think people do business the same
way they did 15 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, some things never change. To join the Denver Club, you
must be nominated and seconded by a member, provide stellar
references and win the board's approval.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not a Bally's or a 24-Hour Fitness," Rosen sniffed. "That's
the way it's worked for 120 years."</TE>
<TE>   Executives can get fine dining, swanky decor and fawning service
at dozens of restaurants in any major city, so why pay good money
just for the privilege of eating at a private club?</TE>
<TE>   This question keeps club managers up at night.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of good restaurants in town and we're fighting for
that same money," said Mark Schwab, general manager of the University
and Whist Club in Wilmington, Del. He regularly quizzes younger
members on what they want from the club, and offers gourmet takeout
meals for busy members.</TE>
<TE>   "The club is an extension of our members' homes," Schwab said.
"They go somewhere else and they're just another customer, no one
special."</TE>
<TE>   The allure of being someone special is what keeps private clubs in
business, despite the setbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like 'Cheers,' where you go and they know your
name," explained O'Neal of Club Corp. "You know it's a safe haven."</TE>
<TE>   But even the standards of exclusivity are flexible. Clubs now have
Web sites and membership directors who will gladly open the door to
almost anyone who can afford the fees and dues.</TE>
<TE>   At Atlanta's Commerce Club, where top executives from Georgia
Pacific, UPS and Coca-Cola sit on the board, you need a sponsor and
two letters of recommendation to join.</TE>
<TE>   "But if you're new to Atlanta and don't know a soul, all you have
to do is call the membership director and we can easily arrange for
you to meet two members over lunch," said Mary Gilbreath, the club's
communication director.</TE>
<TE>   Even as traditional clubs scramble for members, a handful of
spunky upstarts are nipping at their heels.</TE>
<TE>   In Seattle, a private club called the Ruins operates out of a
fabulously refurbished old warehouse in an unfashionable section of
town. The owners, who created the club as an outgrowth of their
high-end catering business, expressed their eclectic tastes in the
decor: One dining room features a life-size model elephant rescued
from a defunct department store.</TE>
<TE>   The attraction remains the same whether the club is old and stodgy
or young and hip.</TE>
<TE>   "In a world that can be chaotic, this is fun, easy and a level of
elegance that I like," said member Marge Levy, who brought two
ferocious little Yorkshire terriers to the Ruins' popular annual
doggie luncheon. "They call me by my first name, they serve me what I
like."</TE>
<TE>   After lunch--hamburgers in doggie bowls for the human members,
gourmet biscuits on silver trays for their canine guests--a local
hip-hop dance troupe performed, bumping and grinding to Britney
Spears and Janet Jackson. Levy and her friends screamed with delight
as their well-bred dogs howled in harmony.</TE>
<TE>   Definitely not your grandfather's private club.</TE>

<HD>Internet, Internet, Make Me a Match, Singles Say</HD>
<DH>Dating: More than a dozen Web sites compile databases of
people in search of love. For a monthly fee, they pair the lonely
hearts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM KRANE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Gary Gervitz wanted a girlfriend, but with stipulations.</LD>
<LD>   She had to be smart.</LD>
<LD>   She had to be politically conservative, but not religious.</LD>
<TE>   She had to be a redhead.</TE>
<TE>   Gervitz, 30, a busy investment manager, knew it would take a
lifetime of scouring bars and college campuses to find such a woman
-- especially in the Bible Belt.</TE>
<TE>   So, the resident of suburban Dallas fired up his computer and
joined an Internet dating service. Within days, he began
corresponding with Susan Crowell, a businesswoman who lived nearby.
These days, her name is Susan Gervitz.</TE>
<TE>   "I happened to have found the one girl who is a redhead, who is
politically conservative, who has a master's-level education and who
is not religious," Gervitz said. "I got her and I married her."</TE>
<TE>   For many businesses, moving onto the Internet has been
disappointing. Not so for the business of matchmaking.</TE>
<TE>   In perhaps the biggest boost for dating since the telephone, the
Internet has allowed companies to compile databases of single people
in search of love, then, for $10 to $50 per month, efficiently match
the lonely hearts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a no-lose situation," said Richard Isaacs, a 60-year-old New
York private investigator, crunching on a tempura shrimp at a
Japanese restaurant. His date, Nuz, a slender 34-year-old Pakistani
fashion designer, nodded in agreement. The pair met in May through a
dating site called Lavalife.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst thing that could happen is the person you meet is
totally horrendous," Isaacs said. "You say, 'Thanks very much.
Goodbye.' "</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen Web sites are now cataloging and matching
eligible singles, straight and gay.</TE>
<TE>   With a potential market of 85 million singles in the United States
alone, several firms are grappling to lead the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Jupiter Research figures that the 15 million Americans who use
online personal ads this year will grow to 24 million by 2007.</TE>
<TE>   Growth in online personals far outstrips that of personal ads
elsewhere, Jupiter analyst Stacey Herron said. "It's become a hip
thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   According to Nielsen/NetRatings, the largest site is Match.com
(www.match.com), owned by Ticketmaster. Yahoo! Personals
(personals.yahoo.com) is No. 2. Other major players include Lavalife
(www.lavalife.com), Date.com (www.date.com), Dream Mates
(www.dreammates.com) and Kiss.com (www.kiss.com).</TE>
<TE>   The Internet's global reach and anonymity fuels the businesses,
eliminating time and distance from the dating equation while easing
the awkwardness of trying to meet someone in, say, a bar.</TE>
<TE>   "It speeds up the evolutionary process, if you will," said Steve
Duininick, 51, a TriBeCa furniture dealer, divorced twice and the
father of four kids. "You can literally do romance on an instant
basis. I could go out with one gal on Friday and another on
Saturday."</TE>
<TE>   The more people use online dating services, the better they get as
databases of singles grow.</TE>
<TE>   "It might take me a month to meet 100 single women" in the normal
fashion, said Al Cooper, director of a San Jose marital clinic and
editor of the forthcoming book "Sex and the Internet: A Guide for
Clinicians." "On the Internet, you could look through 100 people in
an hour."</TE>
<TE>   The sites include share far more information than any newspaper
personal ad, sharing details such as body type, education level, age,
income, hobbies and interests -- and features desired in a mate.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the sites allow visitors to browse pictures and profiles
for free but levy a fee when a browser wants to contact a client,
usually done by e-mail. Clients reveal their identities and contact
information to each other when they feel ready.</TE>
<TE>   In this manner, Internet dating turns the regular courtship
process on its head.</TE>
<TE>   "The good thing about meeting online is that you get to know each
other on an intellectual level first, then you see if you're
attracted on a physical level," said Tim Sullivan, chief executive of
Match.com.</TE>
<TE>   And it's not just young professionals who look for dates online.</TE>
<TE>   The Web sites corral lonely seniors, single moms who have little
time to troll for dates, disabled people -- including the blind, who
use text-to-speech software to read their correspondence -- and those
like Gervitz, with strict criteria in looks, wealth, religious belief
or personal habits.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to find Jamaican midgets, you can find them," Cooper
said. "If you want one-legged women, you can find them."</TE>
<TE>   Once a search turns up a few "hits," you fire off an e-mail or an
instant message. If the correspondence bears fruit, the couple meet
for coffee.</TE>
<TE>   After that, it's purely analog love. The human mating dance --
unpredictable even by computer -- takes over.</TE>
<TE>   Anna Sheffield, 31, has dated 22 men in a year of online
introductions. Two of them broke her heart.</TE>
<TE>   The first was an Australian who e-mailed her rapturously for
months. When they finally met, he wasn't interested.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember thinking, 'I don't necessarily want to cry, but I am
so sad,' " said Sheffield, an actress and part-time lifeguard who
lives in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   The second was a blond Dane who blew her off after what Sheffield
considered a wonderful evening at a trendy SoHo lounge.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't get over that for a while," she said. "I had to force
myself not to call him."</TE>
<TE>   Although clients might wind up with a broken heart, investors
probably won't.</TE>
<TE>   Yahoo! and Lavalife aren't releasing earnings figures, but
Lavalife Chief Executive Peter Housley said the privately held
Toronto-based company makes "tens of millions" in yearly profit.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a cash machine," Housley boasted via cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   Match.com's Sullivan said the site counts more than half a million
paying customers. He estimates that it will rake in $120 million in
revenue this year.</TE>
<TE>   Men make up most of the clientele, providing 70% of the revenue on
Lavalife alone.</TE>
<TE>   Women -- especially those whose pictures depict them as pretty --
get bombarded with messages. Sheffield, whose heart suffered the
sting of a pair of fickle dates, is almost going steady these days
with a man she calls "No. 19."</TE>
<TE>   But she still gets e-mail from her ad on Yahoo! Personals, and she
has been coaxed into a few dates. She tells new men that they'd have
to be pretty special to lure her away from No. 19.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not off the market yet," she said. "But I'm like a house for
sale. I'm under contract."</TE>

<HD>Whatever Floats Your Boat--How About a Latte and a Hotdog?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELANTHIA MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>In this city of java junkies and boat enthusiasts, it was only a
matter of time before someone found a way to float lattes to the
masses.</LD>
<LD>   Dudley Bennett and his wife, Robby, set sail on the Hibernia
Espresso almost every summer weekend -- weeknights if the weather's
nice -- with a bounty of hotdogs, bratwurst, chips and, of course,
coffee.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been going good," Dudley Bennett says during a Friday
evening on Seattle's Lake Union. "The response has been wonderful."</LD>
<TE>   And who's to complain, especially in this city, about the smell of
fresh cappuccino wafting across the water?</TE>
<TE>   Bennett says he'd always wanted a floating barbecue business. He
first thought that the plan would work 10 years ago, when he
remembers seeing a boat called Bob's Espresso.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, he and his wife found a steel tugboat already equipped
with a vendor-style espresso machine. They've spent about $25,000 for
the boat, a smoker for hot dogs, a large backyard grill and a
freezer. Then they got the necessary approval from the health
department.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great way to spend the day," Robby Bennett says with a
sweeping gesture of the lake and downtown Seattle skyline. "We get to
hang out together doing what we like."</TE>
<TE>   This is a second job for the couple, who both work on pleasure
boats. The Hibernia stays docked most of the week, but on weekends,
they're out about eight hours each day, when the lake is more active
with boaters.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial Day weekend was their first official day of business, but
they haven't really made money yet.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we're just putting ourselves out there and getting
everyone used to us," Robby Bennett says after about 30 minutes on
the water without any orders.</TE>
<TE>   Dudley Bennett allows the Hibernia to drift quietly on the lake as
speedboats whiz by and passing kayakers wave hello.</TE>
<TE>   "You kind of get an idea when they want something when they come
beelining right for you," Dudley Bennett says.</TE>
<TE>   He steers toward the lake's eastern side and a group of houseboats
-- maybe there's business there.</TE>
<TE>   The little green, red and white boat nears the docks, drawing
curious glances from people in their homes.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh my God, look at that!" a woman says after reading the sign at
the boat's stern advertising lattes and hotdogs.</TE>
<TE>   "Only in Seattle," another woman says while smiling and shaking
her head.</TE>
<TE>   People have plenty of suggestions -- put up a bigger sign, offer
catering services. The most popular one: "You should add beer to the
menu!"</TE>
<TE>   Both have agreed that beer won't be added to the drinks list. But
they have added "Frosty Paws," much to the pleasure of their dog,
Ziggy, who also goes out on the lake. The liver-flavored ice cream
provides other dog owners with a cool snack for their parched
pooches.</TE>
<TE>   They continue along the boat docks, chatting with people and
asking everyone to look for them over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great idea!" says Meredith Field, who doesn't order any
coffee but makes a request for an early morning coffee delivery to
surprise her dad. "Wait until August; you will be the most popular
boat on the lake."</TE>
<TE>   With a promise to return in the morning, Dudley Bennett heads back
toward the opposite side of the lake.</TE>
<TE>   It seems the day is a bust, but then a speedboat jetties up, its
owner, Tim Gorman, curious to see what the Hibernia has to offer.</TE>
<TE>   "I first saw the color, then I saw the sign and thought, 'Yah
hooey!' " Gorman says as he begins to place his $40 order.</TE>
<TE>   No sooner does Gorman leave than kayaker Kathy Herrmann paddles
up. "I'm surprised that it took this long for someone to come up with
the idea," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Herrmann knows a bit about the coffee business: She works for
Starbucks.</TE>

<HD>Memos to FBI HQ Told of Informants' Shady Lives</HD>
<DH>Crime: Documents show a pattern of collusion involving the
Boston field office, its Washington bosses and the mob.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF DONN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>For more than 20 years, FBI headquarters in Washington knew that its
agents in Boston were using professional killers and mob leaders as
informants and shielding them from prosecution for serious crimes,
including murder, the Associated Press has learned.</LD>
<LD>   Until now, the still-unraveling Boston FBI scandal has been
portrayed largely as the work of a handful of local agents --
mavericks willing to deal with the devil to bring down a Mafia
family.</LD>
<LD>   But documents directly connect FBI headquarters to a pattern of
collusion with notorious New England killers.</LD>
<TE>   Twenty field memos from Boston agents to the FBI director's
office, along with six replies, show that headquarters was informed
about the abuses and condoned them.</TE>
<TE>   The field memos, written between 1964 and 1987, made it clear to
Washington that the informants had killed and were likely to kill
again, describing one of them as "the most dangerous individual
known" in the Boston area. The memos also alerted the director's
office that two of the informants were crime bosses, active "at the
policy-making level" of criminal enterprises in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Headquarters also knew that the informants were being shielded
from other police agencies by its agents in Boston. It knew, for
example, that one informant who masterminded a murder was allowed to
go free as four innocent men were sent to prison in his place.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, it appears, headquarters was directly involved in
protecting the informants. In 1983, for example, Boston agents
shielded two of them from questions about the murder of a jai alai
operator. Senior FBI officials in Washington gave the order to snuff
out the investigation, the deputy chief of the FBI's Boston office at
the time said in a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   J. Edgar Hoover, William S. Sessions and William H. Webster headed
the FBI in the years when the field memos about the informants were
written. Whether they saw them is unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Cartha DeLoach, an assistant FBI director under Hoover, says his
late boss did not always read field memos, adding that he can't
remember seeing the Boston memos himself. Webster and Sessions
declined to be interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   It is uncertain who at FBI headquarters read the memos, but
someone was paying attention. In six responses, all but one unsigned,
the director's office welcomed the informants and praised their FBI
field handlers.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the FBI in Washington declined to comment for this
story, citing ongoing investigations and lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The AP found the FBI memos in the files of a congressional
committee that has begun investigating the abuses, and in records of
related court proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   The roots of the scandal lie in the 1960s, when the FBI -- which
had been devoting many of its resources to investigating Communists
-- came under pressure to crack down on the growing power of
organized crime.</TE>
<TE>   "They were starting to get heat from the country and the media
that not enough was being done about the Mafia," said U.S. Rep. Dan
Burton (R-Ind.), chairman of the committee investigating the
informant abuses. "I think J. Edgar Hoover was sensitive to that."</TE>
<TE>   In Boston, FBI agents responded by recruiting two hit men as
informants and by forging an alliance with the Winter Hill Gang --
vicious thugs eager to seize control of the rackets from the
Patriarca Mafia family.</TE>
<TE>   The nature of the arrangement, as disclosed in recent criminal
proceedings: In return for information about the Mafia, Boston agents
looked the other way as the Winter Hill Gang sold drugs, stole and
murdered, even tipping them off when the state police and federal
drug agents were on their trail.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides got what they wanted. The Patriarca crime family was
devastated by federal prosecutions, and the Winter Hill Gang took
over Boston-area rackets.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers representing victims of violence by FBI informers long
suspected that Washington played a role in the affair, noting that
high-level informants required approval from FBI headquarters.
"Either they knew, or they didn't want to know," said lawyer Edward
Hinchey.</TE>
<TE>   But until the 26 field memos and replies surfaced, there was
little evidence. The memos -- a couple of which have previously been
reported -- somehow survived what one Justice Department lawyer
called the routine destruction of many FBI documents involving the
informants.</TE>
<TE>   The arrangement between the Boston agents and the gangsters
remained secret until 1995, when Massachusetts state police and
federal drug agents finally built a racketeering case against the
Winter Hill Gang. Its leader, James J. "Whitey" Bulger, and his top
lieutenant, Stephen J. "The Rifleman" Flemmi, were indicted along
with five others.</TE>
<TE>   Tipped off by a Boston FBI agent, Bulger escaped and remains at
large. The others were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Flemmi promptly protested that he and Bulger were FBI informants
and that their crimes had been committed under the protection of the
agency. Mark L. Wolf, a U.S District Court judge in Boston, held
hearings on Flemmi's claim, and the story began to tumble out.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf concluded that more than a dozen FBI agents had violated the
law or bureau regulations. So far, one, John Connolly, has been
convicted of racketeering and obstruction of justice and is awaiting
sentencing; and another has been granted immunity for testimony. Both
had also accepted bribes from informants they were protecting.</TE>
<TE>   The Hit Men</TE>
<TE>   Boston FBI agents trying to recruit Vincent J. "The Bear" Flemmi
as an informant knew what he was from the start -- and made sure the
FBI director's office knew too.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Flemmi's younger brother spoke openly of his "plans to
become recognized as the No. 1 'hit man' in this area," Boston agents
told Washington in a June 4, 1964, memo.</TE>
<TE>   At least four field memos informed headquarters that Vincent
Flemmi planned to kill a small-time hoodlum named Edward "Teddy"
Deegan in a dispute over money.</TE>
<TE>   A March 10, 1965, memo, for example, said Vincent Flemmi had asked
Mafia bosses for permission to kill Deegan. And hours before the
murder, Boston agents reported that mob enforcer Joseph "The Animal"
Barboza had joined the plot.</TE>
<TE>   Deegan's body turned up in a Chelsea, Mass., alley on March 12,
1965. A week later, a memo to headquarters named six men, including
Vincent Flemmi and Barboza, as the killers, describing the murder in
detail, right down to who fired the first shot.</TE>
<TE>   An unsigned response from FBI headquarters directed Boston agents
to tell Chelsea police what they knew. But soon, the FBI had another
idea. The agency, it seemed, didn't want Vincent Flemmi in prison. It
wanted him on the streets, as an informer.</TE>
<TE>   On June 4, 1965, FBI records show, the director's office demanded
a progress report. Was he ready to inform?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Boston replied, adding that Vincent Flemmi was suspected in
eight murders and that "from all indications, he is going to continue
to commit murder."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, FBI memos show, Boston agents also recruited Barboza,
convincing him that his Mafia employers had turned on him.</TE>
<TE>   Boston told the director's office in a June 20, 1967 memo, that
Barboza was the most dangerous man in the region, "a professional
assassin responsible for numerous homicides." He was also unreliable,
Boston reported -- a man willing to encourage perjury to spare
himself a long prison term. He had also vowed never to incriminate
his friend, Vincent Flemmi.</TE>
<TE>   But with the promise of a light sentence for his role in the
Deegan murder, Barboza soon became a star witness in three Mafia
trials.</TE>
<TE>   A Massachusetts jury trusted his word and convicted six men in the
Deegan case. Vincent Flemmi and two others identified as the killers
in memos Boston agents had sent to headquarters were never charged.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, FBI files show, the bureau stood by as Barboza's false
testimony convicted four men who had no connection to the crime. Two
died in prison, and two others were released in recent years,
exonerated after the scandal broke.</TE>
<TE>   Barboza had implicated two of them to settle street grudges. The
others, though blameless in Deegan's murder, were known Mafia
figures.</TE>
<TE>   After the convictions, a July 31, 1968, field memo requested
letters of commendation for Barboza's handlers. Hoover sent a
personal reply:</TE>
<TE>   "The successful prosecution of these subjects was a direct result
of your noteworthy development of pertinent witnesses."</TE>
<TE>   In return for his testimony, Barboza was released after serving
five months for the Deegan murder and relocated with a new identity.</TE>
<TE>   Before long, however, he was threatening to recant his testimony
unless given $9,000 for plastic surgery to change his appearance.</TE>
<TE>   If Barboza (who had changed his name to Baron) were to recant, mob
convictions "might be overturned and plunge the government into
protracted and acrimonious litigation," two Justice Department
lawyers who worked closely with Boston FBI agents warned their
Washington supervisor in a Feb. 12, 1970, memo.</TE>
<TE>   "We recommend that by some manner or means, Baron's request be
honored to the degree possible," said the memo from Edward F.
Harrington and Walter T. Barnes.</TE>
<TE>   Six months later, Barboza recanted his testimony; but soon he
changed his mind again, standing by his original story.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes, now retired, said that, as best he can recall, some money
was approved for Barboza. At the time, he had no reason to believe
Barboza had lied on the witness stand, Barnes added in a recent
interview. Harrington, now a federal judge in Massachusetts, declined
comment.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, the Patriarca family found Barboza and exacted its
revenge, shotgunning him on a San Francisco street.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent Flemmi died in prison in 1979 after Massachusetts
authorities convicted him of attempted murder in another case.</TE>
<TE>   'The Bosses'</TE>
<TE>   Bulger and Vincent Flemmi's brother, Stephen, were just starting
their rise in the underworld when Boston agents recruited them as
informants. The agents told headquarters what kind of men they were.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a 1964 field memo described Stephen Flemmi's plot to
"whack" somebody.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 8, 1967, Boston informed headquarters that Stephen Flemmi
was being upgraded to a "top echelon" informant -- even though he was
"suspect[ed] of possibly being involved in gangland slayings."</TE>
<TE>   By 1981, the bureau had adopted rules prohibiting such
arrangements. "Informants shall not participate in acts of violence"
and "shall not initiate a plan to commit criminal acts," the rules
said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in 1983, when Bulger was upgraded to "top echelon" informant,
a field memo said he was "the titular head of the Winter Hill mob and
as such sits as an equal at the policy-making level" with New England
Mafia leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Boston kept headquarters apprised of Stephen Flemmi's rise too,
alerting them, in a Nov. 25, 1987, memo that he was also a
"policy-making" member of the Winter Hill Gang.</TE>
<TE>   The director's office responded with a message of congratulations
for the way the informant was being handled.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the 1980s, local and state police tried to build a case
against Stephen Flemmi and Bulger, but the pair was always one step
ahead of them.</TE>
<TE>   The reason: They were being tipped off by Boston agents, testimony
in recent criminal cases has revealed.</TE>
<TE>   FBI headquarters also may have lent a hand.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, for example, FBI agents in Oklahoma suspected the pair in
the murder of Roger Wheeler, the head of World Jai Alai, who was shot
between the eyes in Tulsa after discovering that someone was skimming
money from his business.</TE>
<TE>   When Oklahoma agents sought to interrogate Bulger and Stephen
Flemmi, Robert Fitzpatrick, then deputy chief of the bureau's Boston
office, deflected suspicion from them and blocked the interrogations.</TE>
<TE>   He was instructed to do so during a meeting in Washington with top
FBI officials including Sean McWeeney, head of the FBI's organized
crime section under Webster, Fitzpatrick said in a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   "It was to protect Whitey Bulger," said Fitzpatrick, now retired.
"That was part of the discussion."</TE>
<TE>   McWeeney, also retired, did not reply to requests for an
interview.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, however, even the FBI could not protect the informers
forever.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Stephen Flemmi is serving 10 years for obstruction of
justice and other offenses and awaiting trial on federal racketeering
charges that link him to 10 murders.</TE>
<TE>   Bulger, still on the run, is also under indictment for
racketeering. Federal prosecutors blame him and his gang for 21
killings.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven of them occurred while he was an FBI informant.</TE>

<HD>Remains Found in Union Warship</HD>
<DH>Archeology: Discovery of bone fragments inside gun turret
of Civil War wreckage halts work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HATTERAS, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Archeologists excavating the wreckage of the Monitor said Friday that
they had apparently found human remains inside the gun turret of the
Civil War vessel.</LD>
<LD>   John Broadwater, an archeologist with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration and the expedition manager, said other
work was halted so the remains could be preserved and analyzed.</LD>
<LD>   The shipwreck is in 240 feet of water 16 miles off North
Carolina's Outer Banks.</LD>
<TE>   The Union warship revolutionized naval warfare when it battled the
Confederate ironclad Virginia to a draw in March 1862 at Hampton
Roads. It was history's first clash of ironclads.</TE>
<TE>   The Monitor sank in a storm off Cape Hatteras in 1862, killing 16
officers and crew.</TE>
<TE>   The wreckage was located in 1973 and was designated the first
national marine sanctuary two years later.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Emery, an archeologist with the Army's Central Identification
Laboratory, said the remains consisted of two bone fragments, one 6
to 7 inches long, the other 10 to 11 inches long. He said it is
possible that the remains will be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Broadwater said the discovery probably won't delay the
expedition's main purpose, which is to recover the Monitor's
distinctive cylindrical gun turret for display at the Mariners'
Museum in Newport News.</TE>
<TE>   If the weather remains favorable, the attempt to raise the turret
could begin this week.</TE>

<HD>Military Jets Scramble Over D.C.; a Witness Describes a
Blue UFO</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE VOGEL</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Renny Rogers, it was strange enough that military jets were
flying low over his home in Waldorf, Md., in the middle of the night.
It was what he thinks he saw when he headed outside to look early
Friday that floored him.</LD>
<LD>   "It was this object, this light-blue object, traveling at a
phenomenal rate of speed," Rogers said. "This Air Force jet was right
behind it, chasing it, but the object was just leaving him in the
dust. I told my neighbor, 'I think those jets are chasing a UFO.' "</LD>
<LD>   Military officials confirm that two F-16 jets from Andrews Air
Force Base were scrambled Friday after radar detected an unknown
aircraft in Washington-area airspace. But they scoff at the idea that
the jets were chasing a strange and speedy blue unidentified flying
object.</LD>
<TE>   "We had a track of interest, so we sent up some aircraft," said
Maj. Douglas Martin, a spokesman for the North American Aerospace
Defense Command (NORAD) in Colorado, which has responsibility for
defending U.S. airspace. "Everything was fine in the sky, so they
returned home."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, military officials say they do not know just
what the jets were chasing, because whatever it was disappeared.
"There are any number of scenarios, but we don't know what it was,"
said Maj. Barry Venable, another NORAD spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Radar detected a low, slow-flying aircraft about 1 a.m. Friday,
according to a military official. Controllers were unable to
establish radio communications with the unidentified aircraft, and
NORAD was notified. When the F-16s carrying air-to-air missiles were
launched from Andrews, the unidentified aircraft's track faded from
the radar, the military official said, speaking on condition that he
not be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots with the D.C. Air National Guard's 113th Air Wing, which
flew the F-16s from Andrews, reported nothing out of the ordinary,
NORAD officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a routine launch," said Lt. Col. Steve Chase, a senior
officer with the air wing, which keeps pilots and armed jets on
24-hour alert at Andrews to respond to incidents as part of a
post-Sept. 11 air defense system protecting Washington from terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers remains convinced that what he saw was not routine.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like a shooting star with no trailing mist," he said.
"I've never seen anything like it."</TE>

<HD>Reforms Could Embolden Employees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The truth about the reforms being rushed into law by Congress or
commanded by the New York Stock Exchange is that they will shift
power and influence to the true owners of U.S. public companies.</LD>
<LD>   The owners are the more than 100 million Americans who hold more
than $5 trillion worth of company stock through their pension funds,
retirement plans and individual retirement accounts.</LD>
<LD>   Through their retirement investments--along with about $2 trillion
in the old-style defined benefit or guaranteed pension plans of large
corporations, unions and state and local governments-- U.S. workers
own more than 60% of the stock in all U.S. public companies.</LD>
<TE>   Yet they have not exercised the power and authority that come with
ownership, ceding control to corporate executives to manage companies
as they see fit.</TE>
<TE>   But a transfer of authority from executive suites to
representatives of the shareholder-employees is occurring as
Americans grow concerned about the erosion of their retirement
savings.</TE>
<TE>   "This summer will be a watershed period" for changing the ways
companies are managed and report to shareholders, says John Biggs,
chairman and chief executive of TIAA-CREF, the Teachers Insurance and
Annuity Assn.-College Retirement Equities Fund--the nation's largest
pension fund, with more than $270 billion in assets.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has approved legislation to crack down on misleading
accounting and management practices and to hold corporate chief
executives more accountable for the facts and figures reported to
shareholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Independent
directors will assert authority in company boardrooms.</TE>
<TE>   And managers of the investment funds of millions of ordinary
workers will have to "wake up and recognize their fiduciary
obligation to represent the shareholders," says Biggs, who has worked
for the reforms now being written into law or mandated by the New
York Stock Exchange and individual companies.</TE>
<TE>   Change will come at a cost. For example, accounting changes that
would require charging stock options as expenses could reduce
earnings and probably stock prices for many companies.</TE>
<TE>   But the executives have only themselves to blame. In many big
companies with defined benefit pension plans, management failed to
make contributions to their pension plans for several years because
rising stock values had swelled the plans' assets.</TE>
<TE>   They put the money saved from pension plans into reported
earnings, thus hiking their company stock price--and their own
income.</TE>
<TE>   But now, after 2 1/2 years of stock market losses, guaranteed
pension plans have a huge shortfall that must be covered with
catch-up contributions. Those contributions could total more than $70
billion and reduce the earnings of major U.S. companies in the next
few years, says Robert Arnott, head of First Quadrant, a Pasadena
firm that manages pension fund investments.</TE>
<TE>   The effect of these charges and others to correct misleading
accounting could reduce potential average returns on stock and mutual
fund investments 3% to 4%, or roughly half the returns that were
available in the late 1990s, Arnott says.</TE>
<TE>   So the real impetus for reform at this time is not a "few bad
apples" committing fraud, but the fact that corporate managements'
abuse of the system was widespread and has endangered the retirement
savings of American workers.</TE>
<TE>   To understand the context of what's happening today, look back to
a previous shift in responsibility. Through the 1970s, almost all
pension plans were of the defined benefit or guaranteed variety.</TE>
<TE>   But poor investment performance in the inflationary '70s imposed
on U.S businesses greater and greater costs of maintaining such
pensions.</TE>
<TE>   So in the early 1980s, many companies began to foster new kinds of
pension plans in which employees would invest in mutual funds or
company stocks and the company would make matching contributions--but
without any guarantee that beneficiaries would receive a fixed
pension on retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "Corporate America decided that defined benefit plans were simply
too expensive, so they would convert to defined contribution plans
under the rising market propaganda that they were freeing individuals
to invest for themselves," says Robert A.G. Monks, a longtime
campaigner for corporate reform and head of the federal pension fund
protection agency under President Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   Employees took on the risks</TE>
<TE>   but did not get much of the responsibility for managing the
company or keeping it in sound financial shape. And the managers of
investment funds seldom challenged corporate managements "because
they depended on them for business," says Biggs of TIAA-CREF, an
84-year-old organization that administers defined contribution
pension plans for college personnel.</TE>
<TE>   But that imbalance is changing because of the ongoing stock market
downturn and the sheer weight of employee ownership.</TE>
<TE>   Participants in defined contribution plans now number 58 million,
with 42 million more covered by guaranteed or defined benefit plans
and additional tens of millions invested in U.S. markets through
IRAs. The constituency for reform is overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   New laws regulating corporate behavior will bring about reforms,
but more meaningful changes will come as boards of directors and
shareholders become more actively involved in company oversight, says
Nell Minow, editor of the Corporate Library, a Web site devoted to
corporate governance issues.</TE>
<TE>   She commends the New York Stock Exchange proposals that would
require directors to assert their authority and that would subject
management stock awards to shareholder votes.</TE>
<TE>   The balance will change, as CEOs operate under tighter direction
from their boards and from the managers of the investment funds that
own the stock. Investment managers will take a more active role in
setting corporate policies covering management, compensation,
benefits and other issues.</TE>
<TE>   Reforms, which may sound merely technical, have a proud history of
effectiveness, beginning with the original reforms after the market
crash of 1929 that brought regulation--and integrity--to investment
markets.</TE>
<TE>   Subsequent reforms through the decades have succeeded in shoring
up that integrity--a priceless asset--and in protecting the interests
of the owners of U.S. business. These owners increasingly have been
the very employees of U.S. business, who now are being emboldened to
assert their authority.</TE>

<DH>Drug industry expects big sales from a new class of cancer
drugs</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just days after Susan Nelson started taking an experimental
lung-cancer medicine, she was able to laugh without triggering a long
coughing fit. Soon, she could hike through the scrub-covered hills
near her Riverside County home without losing her breath.</LD>
<LD>   A chest scan taken five weeks after Nelson, 48, started treatment
showed why she felt better: The once-daily pills had shrunk her
tumors by 75%.</LD>
<LD>   The cancer medicine used by Nelson is not yet for sale in the
United States. It is in the final stages of clinical testing and
could obtain government approval this year. It was cleared for sale
in Japan this month.</LD>
<TE>   Called Iressa, it is the first drug in a class that disrupts the
molecular switches responsible for tumor growth. The switches, called
epidermal growth factor receptors, or EGF-receptors, are found on
two-thirds of solid tumors.</TE>
<TE>   The drug, developed by British drug maker AstraZeneca, is in the
same class as Erbitux, the experimental treatment engulfed in the
ImClone Systems Inc. insider-trading controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Iressa does not cure cancer, and, for reasons not understood, does
not help every patient. In a company-sponsored study, the medicine
shrank tumors by 50% or more in just 11% of patients with metastatic
disease--cancer that had spread to the other lung or another organ.
Four patients in 10 said they could breathe more easily after taking
the drug.</TE>
<TE>   The results are modest, but doctors are impressed. The patients
who took Iressa in clinical trials were very sick and had tried two
to three rounds of chemotherapy, toxic drugs that kill cancer cells
but make patients feel worse. Few patients with advanced disease
respond to medication, said Dr. Roy Herbst of the M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the best thing we have seen in years," said Herbst, who
conducted some of the trials.</TE>
<TE>   Few medical experts expect EGF-receptor drugs to replace
chemotherapy as the primary treatment for lung cancer, the leading
cause of cancer death. But some doctors think the new drugs could be
safely combined with chemotherapy to deliver a stronger blow to
cancer cells early in the disease, when it will do the most good.
Clinical trials to test that theory are underway.</TE>
<TE>   EGF-receptor drugs offer great promise to an industry beset with
patent expirations and a dearth of new products. As a group, these
drugs could have peak sales of $4.5 billion, said David Bouchey, an
analyst with C.E. Unterberg, Towbin. Iressa could account for $1.5
billion of that, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Only one cancer drug, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s Taxol, now off
patent, has had sales of more than $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Driving Bouchey's forecast is an assumption that the drugs will be
used to treat several types of cancer. AstraZeneca and its
competitors are testing the therapies in cancers that affect the
colon, pancreas, head and neck. Taken together, those cancers affect
nearly as many Americans as lung cancer. Beyond that, AstraZeneca
said, it is conducting more than 100 "exploratory trials" in other
cancers in which Iressa might prove effective.</TE>
<TE>   AstraZeneca is the front-runner in the race to market because of
missteps by ImClone Systems. In December, the Food and Drug
Administration rejected ImClone's application to market Erbitux,
citing numerous flaws in the company's data--a setback that pushed
Erbitux to third place. The company's former chief executive, Samuel
D. Waksal, faces insider-trading charges for allegedly tipping off
relatives to the bad news before the FDA action became public
knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   Iressa's closest competitor is Tarceva, an EGF-receptor drug being
developed by OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc., Genentech Inc. and Roche
Group, which is expected to reach the market by mid-2004. Trailing
them are Abgenix, Pfizer Inc., Wyeth and GlaxoSmithKline, which have
EGF-receptor drugs in development.</TE>
<TE>   AstraZeneca Chief Executive Tom McKillop last week stood by his
prediction that Iressa would reach the U.S. market this year. He said
the company will complete its marketing application in August and
expects FDA approval in the fall. But analysts said the timing is
tight and AstraZeneca is months behind schedule in filing paperwork
with the FDA. They said the launch of Iressa could be delayed until
early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Stephens Inc. analyst Jason Y. Zhang said the FDA could delay its
decision until it sees the results from two large clinical trials
designed to measure whether patients on Iressa live longer. The
trials compare 1,000 patients on Iressa and standard chemotherapy
with 1,000 others on chemotherapy alone. McKillop told analysts that
the outcome of those trials won't be known until later this year.</TE>
<TE>   No Serious Side Effects</TE>
<TE>   Evidence that a drug improves survival is the gold standard for
approval. The FDA rejected oxaliplatin, a chemotherapy drug developed
by French drug maker Sanofi-Synthelabo, because it was not more
successful at extending patients' lives than existing drugs. Sanofi
currently is testing a cocktail of oxaliplatin and other drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA does not comment on drugs under review. AstraZeneca
spokeswoman Mary Lynn Carver dismissed the analysts' comments as
speculation.</TE>
<TE>   To doctors, the drug is important because it eases patients'
symptoms without the debilitating side effects of chemotherapy. Dr.
Ronald B. Natale of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center said patients with
"terribly terminal" lung cancer breathed easier and coughed less
after taking Iressa. The relief lasted three to six months.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can't help patients live a day longer, we want to help them
feel better for whatever time they have," said Natale, an
investigator in the company-sponsored trials. "To a bedside
clinician, these are impressive results."</TE>
<TE>   AstraZeneca has not discussed a price for the drug, but it will be
high. The company charges $2,200 a month in Japan, suggesting a
monthly price tag of $2,000 here, said analyst Bouchey, though
McKillop cautioned against using the Japanese price as a benchmark.
Medicare won't pay for it, because Iressa is only in pill form. The
federal insurance program covers cancer drugs if they also come in an
intravenous form that must be given by a doctor at a medical
facility.</TE>
<TE>   Iressa comes at an important time for London-based AstraZeneca.
Its indigestion pill, Prilosec, faces generic competition and
Crestor, its experimental anti-cholesterol drug, has suffered
regulatory setbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Tarceva is the most important drug in development at OSI, a small
New York company that has bet its future on oncology. ImClone's
survival could hinge on the success of Erbitux. Doctors and company
executives said not enough data are available to know which drug, if
any, is superior.</TE>
<TE>   As the race tightens, being first becomes less advantageous, said
OSI Chairman and Chief Executive Colin Goddard. "Fast followers
frequently do very, very well," Goddard said. "One advantage of
coming second is you learn from the people ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Free Access to Drug</TE>
<TE>   By the time Iressa reaches the market in the United States,
however, oncologists will be very familiar with the drug. Since the
fall of 2000, AstraZeneca has provided the drug free to 15,000 cancer
patients, many in the United States, in what is believed to be the
largest giveaway of its kind.</TE>
<TE>   AstraZeneca spokeswoman Carver said the company launched the
expanded access program to fulfill an "ethical obligation."</TE>
<TE>   "We knew our clinical trials could not hold all the patients who
need it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The program also benefits AstraZeneca, which cannot under FDA
rules promote an unapproved drug through advertising or sales calls
to doctors. Dr. Stephen Shibuta, a staff physician at City of Hope
National Medical Center, said the expanded-access program is in part
marketing-driven.</TE>
<TE>   "When the FDA approves it, a large number of physicians will be
used to prescribing it," Shibuta said. "This is not going to be an
obscure product."</TE>
<TE>   AstraZeneca has limited participation in the program to people
with lung cancer, the market it plans to target first. That has
caused some people to question the depth of the company's altruism.</TE>
<TE>   In a high-profile case last year, AstraZeneca turned away Abigail
Burroughs, a Virginia college student, because she had head and neck
cancer. After that, OSI accepted Burroughs into a clinical trial, but
she died before it started.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they are being compassionate, but I think they could be
more compassionate," Frank Burroughs said about AstraZeneca. He heads
a patient-advocacy group named for his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson is among the thousands of patients who received the free
drug. In 1989, she was diagnosed with bronchoalveolar carcinoma, a
slow-growing lung cancer. Doctors removed a portion of her right
lung, but in 1994 the cancer recurred.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson fought her disease with strict diets and folk remedies such
as laetrile, but by August, the tumors had formed a large mass in
each lung.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a year later, Nelson is free of symptoms. An athletic woman
who never smoked, Nelson recently put up 10 100-pound bales of hay
for her horses without becoming breathless. The only sign that she is
a lung-cancer patient is the rash that sometimes appears on her back
and thighs, the most frequent side effect of Iressa and other drugs
in its class.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel as if I have been given a gift," said Nelson, a Temecula
teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Her doctor, Natale of Cedars-Sinai, said that for Nelson, Iressa
was the right choice. Her tumors continued to shrink and are 90%
smaller.</TE>
<TE>   "She had a wonderful response," he said. "It is unfortunate it
doesn't work that well very often."</TE>

<TE>New Class of Cancer Drugs</TE>
<TE>Iressa is the first in a new class of cancer drugs that disrupt
epidermal growth factor receptors, molecular switches responsible for
tumor growth. Several others are in development, and some analysts
think EGF-receptor drugs could reach peak sales of $4.5 billion.</TE>

<LD>It is ironic that public officials are crying foul over corporate
greed when they were large beneficiaries of the dot-com wealth
bubble, reaping a record level of tax revenue from exercised options.</LD>
<LD>   If the corporate crooks are forced to return their ill-gotten loot
to investors, shouldn't the government also give back to investors
the taxes it took in on this income?</LD>
<LD>   When the real estate bubble bursts, leaving thousands of new
homeowners in financial distress, the accusations of greed will be
flying again from these same officials directed at the real estate,
development and lending institutions.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, these officials do nothing to stem the explosion in

<TE>   Reforms Meaningless Without Enforcement</TE>
<TE>   So, Congress is shying away from hard-hitting securities reforms
that would protect retirement funds ["1995 Tort Reform Act Said to
Provide Safe Harbor for Fraud," July 21]?</TE>
<TE>   Why am I not surprised? When the Retirement Savings and Consumer
Protection Act was on the California ballot in 1996, Wall Street,
Silicon Valley and the "Big Six" accounting firms spent a
record-setting $40 million to successfully defeat consumers' and
seniors' attempts to protect their nest eggs.</TE>
<TE>   These are the same corporate interests fighting meaningful
consumer protection reform in Congress today.</TE>
<TE>   The corporate-sponsored 1995 Tort Reform Act weakened investors'
protections that Congress enacted after the Great Depression. This
law must be overturned: Not until corporate CEOs, directors, lawyers,
accountants and brokers are held personally responsible for their
illegal activities will our retirement funds be safe from excessive
corporate greed.</TE>
<TE>   New laws, however, are meaningless if not accompanied by diligent
government enforcement. That's why legal liability of everyone
involved in corporate swindling is essential. Lawsuits hit corporate
bandits where it hurts the most--in their pocketbooks.</TE>

<TE>   No Reliable Barometer of Volatile Market</TE>
<TE>   I almost dismissed your analysis "Fed Chief Now Blamed for
Inflating Stock Bubble" [July 21] as just another benighted
misjudgment of the reasons for the current decline in the stock
market, because every commentator, analyst and economist from Alan
Greenspan on down has it all wrong. You, though, have it all right.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan may or may not be responsible for the inflation and
collapse directly, but you are right on when you say "... share
prices were driven to stratospheric heights by the hope of further
gain, rather than remaining tethered to something fundamental like a
company's profits."</TE>
<TE>   This is exactly why both President Bush and Greenspan completely
miss the point in talking about the stock market turning around
because the economy and productivity are good. The time is long since
past when that had any relevance whatsoever.</TE>
<TE>   That truth was tacitly acknowledged when the market and the
analysts began to look not to how well the individual companies were
doing to predict what the market would do, but to what interest rate
the Fed would set.</TE>
<TE>   That barometer wore out, though, when the Japanese dropped the
interest rate to zero and their stock market continued to decline.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is that the stock market will go up when the stock market
goes up. This is true because nobody, or at least very few, invests
in stocks because a particular company is being more efficient, has a
great new product or a great new CEO.</TE>

pension dollars you may have already earned--and forgotten about.</LD>
<LD>   Experts estimate that as many as 5% of Americans who are due
pension benefits are in effect missing in action. These are people
who got new jobs, moved or maybe remarried and changed their names,
never bothering to notify former employers of their whereabouts.</LD>
<LD>   The bottom line is that millions of dollars of retirement checks
are going unclaimed.</LD>
<TE>   "If you lost your wallet at the grocery store, you'd rush back to
find it," said Steve Kandarian, executive director of Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corp. in Washington. "Well, here's a case where workers may
have lost a pension worth thousand of dollars."</TE>
<TE>   There are many reasons that people may have lost track of
pensions, said Regina Pizzonia, vice president and associate counsel
for T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Workers might not realize that they were accruing benefits because
they worked for a small employer who didn't do a good job of
communicating plan benefits. Or they may have been so young that they
paid no attention to retirement benefits. Or they may have lost track
of an employer that was purchased or merged into another company,
never stopping to think that the new company would hold the old
company's pension assets.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, it's likely that hundreds of thousands of
individuals have pensions waiting for them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that it's a gigantic number of people involved, but
sometimes it's a lot of money," Pizzonia said. "You have to imagine
that this is money that the participant could really use."</TE>
<TE>   Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. has been operating an online search
tool for lost pensioners whose plans were taken over by regulators
because the company filed for bankruptcy protection or dissolved its
plan.</TE>
<TE>   During that time, more than 12,000 individuals have found pensions
worth $1 to $172,000, according to PBGC officials. Just since
October, the agency has found 1,934 lost participants, owed an
average of $5,791 each. The agency still has $57 million belonging to
15,000 pensioners.</TE>
<TE>   To find a lost pension that's held by the PBGC, go to the pension
search prompt at www.pbgc.gov and type in your name and Social
Security number. If there's a match, the agency will require some
paperwork, but usually within four to six weeks, the pension is
recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Those who lost track of a former employer may have a tougher time,
particularly if that employer has changed names, merged or otherwise
muddied its corporate identity. Because this type of search can be
time-consuming, those who are unsure whether they have vested
benefits with a long-lost employer may want to assess their chances
before looking, regulators say.</TE>
<TE>   Today, most plans require five years of employment to become
vested in, or fully entitled to, a company pension. However, before
the mid-1980s, it typically took 10 years; and before the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act was passed in 1975, many companies
provided pensions only if you worked for them until you retired.</TE>
<TE>   Translation: The older the work history, the less likely you are
to have a vested pension.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, in 1984 a law was passed to protect spousal rights
under pension law. Surviving spouses of individuals who earned a
pension after that point also could be due benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The place to start searching for a lost pension is in your
records. Look for benefits statements, summary plan descriptions or
exit letters that you may have received from an old employer.</TE>
<TE>   The Social Security Administration may be able to help. The agency
maintains earnings records and employer identification numbers. That
identification number could help you find a plan that has been taken
over by another company. The Social Security Administration can be
reached toll-free at (800) 772-1213.</TE>
<TE>   If workers at your former company were represented by a union, the
union may have information about whether there is a company pension
and what happened to the firm and its benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at a local Chamber of Commerce--or a helpful
librarian--also could help you track corporate histories, finding
leads on a company that has moved or merged.</TE>
<TE>   Once you find the company, it's up to you to contact the benefit
representatives to stake your claim.</TE>
<TE>   If you're certain you're owed a pension, but you can't find the
company or can't persuade the benefits representatives to help you,
contact a pension-counseling project. There are 10 such projects
nationwide. In California, the Pension Rights Project is in San
Francisco and can be reached toll-free at (800) 474-1116.</TE>

<HD>Virginia Town Awaits Fate of WorldCom</HD>
<DH>Telecom: As part of the growing high-tech corridor just
outside Washington, Ashburn prospered. Now it faces an uncertain
future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ASHBURN, Va.</DL>
<LD>Heralding WorldCom Inc.'s decision to build a massive campus amid
farm fields here, then-Gov. James S. Gilmore III of Virginia plunged
a shovel into the ground in 1998 and predicted that the company's
arrival would drive "growth and profits" in the region for years to
come.</LD>
<LD>   But four years later--after an accounting scandal forced WorldCom
to seek the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history on July
21--shell-shocked employees are circulating their resumes and the
Clinton, Miss.-based company is trying to unload billions of dollars
worth of assets, including some of the real estate holdings on this
590-acre site.</LD>
<LD>   In recent months, WorldCom's Ashburn campus--so large that it has
its own bank, dry cleaner and restaurants--has seen a series of
layoffs and downsizings that has left the employee parking lot nearly
half empty.</LD>
<TE>   "Everyone I know is worried about losing their job," said one
WorldCom employee. "This has been such a roller-coaster ride--up and
then down, down."</TE>
<TE>   Even nearby merchants such as Benny Scotto, manager of Pomodoro
pizza parlor across the street, are worried about their future.</TE>
<TE>   "People who came to this area early" cashed in on the soaring
housing values and robust economy that was fueled by the opening of
WorldCom's campus, Scotto said. "Those who came late like me are now
paying the price."</TE>
<TE>   Along with neighbor AOL Time Warner Inc., the arrival of WorldCom,
its MCI long-distance telephone subsidiary and its UUNet high-speed
data network unit helped make Northern Virginia a high-tech mecca.
The region eventually lured about 2,500 computer and
telecommunications firms, including Internet domain name issuer
Verisign Inc. and wireless phone provider Nextel Communications Inc.</TE>
<TE>   With the influx of companies, job growth spurted. At its peak,
Virginia's high-tech industry employed more than 350,000 people.
Gilmore dubbed his state the "Silicon Dominion" and boasted that the
arrival of behemoths such as WorldCom and AOL could enable Virginia
to one day eclipse California's Silicon Valley as the premier
high-tech destination.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the state has seen a high-tech meltdown. Dozens of
onetime stalwarts such as Internet access provider PSINet Inc.--which
once had its name plastered across the football stadium where the
Baltimore Ravens play--and wireless phone provider Teligent Inc.
filed for bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   The latest casualty, WorldCom, was once the highest-flying company
in telecommunications. And its financial woes have hit hard the
company's remaining 3,500 employees in Ashburn, many of whom had
become true believers in Chief Executive Bernard J. Ebbers'
decade-long campaign to gobble up new acquisitions and deliver
double-digit growth.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts and former WorldCom employees say the company's
bankruptcy filing symbolizes the end of an era of robust
telecommunications competition that saw long-distance phone rates
plunge 40% and the emergence of more than 4,000 Internet service
providers.</TE>
<TE>   The founder of WorldCom's MCI unit, William McGowan, is credited
with spurring the modern telecommunications era with a
take-no-prisoners marketing campaign that opened the way for MCI--and
later upstarts such as WorldCom--to challenge AT&amp;T Corp.'s dominant
role in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   By 1998, MCI was such a force that it commanded a $40-billion
price tag when WorldCom bought the company in a deal that experts
predicted would reshape the telecommunications landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with WorldCom, Global Crossing Ltd., Qwest Communications
International Inc. and others in financial straits, industry
observers say McGowan, who died in 1992, would have been aghast at
what has become of the telecommunications revolution he started in
the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "That visionary fighter for competition would be rolling over in
his grave" at the thought of his company having to file for
bankruptcy protection, said Scott C. Cleland, a telecommunications
analyst at Washington research firm Precursor Group.</TE>
<TE>   Added David Thompson, a former WorldCom spokesman who is a
consultant in Bowie, Md., "This whole thing with WorldCom has caused
a lot of anxiety and bad taste in the mouths of investors and
employees alike."</TE>
<TE>   None of the two dozen WorldCom employees approached at WorldCom's
Ashburn campus would comment for the record. But many said the mood
among employees ranged from bitterness to hope that new CEO John W.
Sidgmore can revive the company.</TE>
<TE>   "This all just seemed to come out of nowhere," said one woman, who
has worked at WorldCom for about 2 1/2 years. "No company is without
problems, but it seems the higher-ups didn't want to deal" with the
financial problems earnestly and early on.</TE>
<TE>   "Being laid off is always difficult and hard, and my heart goes
out to the workers," said Mark. R. Herring, a Loudoun County
supervisor who represents the Leesburg district where WorldCom is
located. "I believe that Loudoun County is a great place to do
business....I think we all are concerned about how businesses have
been handling their accounting in the wake of these recent
disclosures, but I am hopeful that WorldCom can resolve its
problems."</TE>
<TE>   Last Sunday night, Sidgmore sent employees an e-mail apologizing
for seeking federal bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   "Like you, I've been through the range of emotions the last couple
of months--shock, anger and embarrassment when we discovered the
accounting problems ... and concern for you and your families,"
Sidgmore wrote, according to an excerpt provided by a WorldCom
employee. "I apologize for what has happened."</TE>
<TE>   But he said he would "commit to being here for the future" and
asked employees to stick with him.</TE>
<TE>   "Not everyone is pessimistic," said a WorldCom employee. "I think
the company can turn things around....We still have a lot of smart
people and a lot of customers."</TE>

<HD>Credit Counseling Isn't Necessarily Harmful</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I recently started with a credit counseling service, which
is helping me deal with three creditors that had increased my
interest rates to 29%. When I informed the credit card companies,
however, I was told that credit counseling was as bad as filing
bankruptcy. My current credit report shows no late payments and I am
quite concerned.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: It's too bad some creditors try to scare their clients
away from credit counseling, which can be helpful if you're
overwhelmed by debt and unable to make minimum payments on your
cards. Reputable credit counseling services can help you lower your
interest payments and work out a plan to pay off what you owe.</LD>
<LD>   It's true that some lenders view credit counseling in a negative
light, but it's hardly "as bad as filing bankruptcy." Bankruptcy
stays on your credit report for up to 10 years, and is universally
viewed as a huge black mark by mainstream lenders.</LD>
<TE>   By contrast, lenders have a wide range of views about credit
counseling, with some viewing it as a positive and others seeing it
as neutral.</TE>
<TE>   The most widely used credit scoring formula, for example, now
ignores any reference to consumer credit counseling that might be in
your file.</TE>
<TE>   The company that creates the score, Fair Isaac &amp; Co., discovered
three years ago that consumers who participate in the programs are at
no higher risk of default than anyone else, according to spokesman
Craig Watts.</TE>
<TE>   Not all lenders use this score, of course, and some won't make
loans to people who have recently been through credit counseling.</TE>
<TE>   Because lenders react in different ways, credit counseling is
probably best for those who can't work out reasonable payment plans
with their creditors on their own.</TE>
<TE>   People with generally good credit, for example, often can win a
lower rate from their lenders simply by threatening to take their
business someplace else.</TE>
<TE>   Estate Tax Exemption Is</TE>
<TE>   Per Person, Not Couple</TE>
<TE>   Q: I am confused about the exemption of $1 million for the estate
tax. I always thought it was $1 million per person, but my friends
all tell me that what a husband and wife own jointly is considered
part of one estate, and so couples get only a $1-million exemption if
they die simultaneously. Who's right?</TE>
<TE>   A: Friends shouldn't let friends give estate-planning advice.</TE>
<TE>   You don't give up your exemption when you marry. The exemption is
per person, not per couple. This year, the first $1 million of any
person's assets can go to heirs free of estate taxes. (The limit is
scheduled to rise until 2010, when the estate tax is supposed to
disappear for a year. In 2011, the limit is again scheduled to be $1
million.)</TE>
<TE>   What's more, spouses can leave each other an unlimited amount of
property and assets without any estate tax. That's one of the many
advantages, financially speaking, of being married.</TE>
<TE>   With Firm in Chapter 11,</TE>
<TE>   Time to Sell the Shares</TE>
<TE>   Q: Your column on stock in bankrupt companies was timely for me.
The week before, I had received a court document notifying me that a
company whose shares I own had filed for Chapter 11. For the last
couple of years, I've been meaning to sell my shares (which had
dropped to the $1 level) and take the tax loss, but there didn't seem
to be any rush. Now I'm not sure what to do.</TE>
<TE>   A: If your company filed for Chapter 11 reorganization, its shares
probably still are trading somewhere. If that's the case, you can
sell them and take the tax loss. You also could ask your broker, if
you have one, to buy the shares from you for $1. Some brokerages are
willing to do this as a courtesy to their customers.</TE>
<TE>   It's usually better to do this than to opt for the "worthless
stock" deduction. In general, the company must be out of business and
the stock must have stopped trading for you to take that route.</TE>
<TE>   There's a reason that most professional money managers sell stocks
long before they drop below $1 a share. Although a few companies
bounce back, many that have fallen to this level never recover.</TE>
<TE>   Servers Pay Taxes Even</TE>
<TE>   If They Get No Tips</TE>
<TE>   Q: Thank you so much for your reply to the person who wrote to
complain about tipping. You are so right that this guy is just plain
cheap and has obviously never toted a tray in his life! Most of us
servers work for minimum wage and rely on tips to supplement our
income. We're not making six figures or defrauding the government. I
hope your response will make someone think twice before stiffing
their server, bartender or bellman.</TE>
<TE>   A: The original writer's contention was that servers are skirting
tax rules by not declaring their tip income. That seemed to justify,
to him, his practice of not tipping at all.</TE>
<TE>   His letter certainly stirred up a hornet's nest. I heard from
several servers who complained that the IRS taxes them on 8% of their
receipts, whether or not they collect that much in tips. The Supreme
Court recently strengthened the IRS' ability to estimate tips based
on restaurant receipts, a decision that means more tip income will be
reported (whether it's actually received or not).</TE>
<TE>   People who are tempted to stiff a server might also consider that
the minimum wage for employees who get tips can be as little as $2.13
an hour, according to the Fair Labor Standards Act. Employers are
supposed to make up the difference between that rate and the regular
minimum wage of $5.15 an hour if tips fall short, but some don't even
do that.</TE>

<HD>Capitalists' War on Capitalism Creates Bargains for the
Brave</HD>

<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Karl Marx was right: Routinely, it's capitalists who turn out to be
the greatest enemies of capitalism.</LD>
<LD>   When the Dow Jones industrial average sank 14% in the week ended
Sept. 21 of last year, the blame was laid on shadowy Islamic
terrorists who were out to destroy the American way of life.</LD>
<LD>   But this summer, as the Dow has fallen 20% in 10 weeks, many
investors believe the culprits occupy corporate boardrooms right here
in the homeland, rather than drafty caves in Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   Stocks rebounded in the fourth quarter of last year as the market
came to conclude that the terrorists ultimately would fail to destroy
the U.S. and what it stands for.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Wall Street's rebound late last week was largely
attributed to the idea that the current nest of alleged saboteurs had
been uncovered and was being dealt with accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow rocketed 488 points Wednesday, its best one-day gain in 15
years, after Congress reached a deal on legislation to sharply boost
penalties for white-collar fraud--the federal response to the
avalanche of corporate financial scandals that began with Enron Corp.
in December and since has immortalized such names as Global Crossing
Ltd., Adelphia Communications Corp. and WorldCom Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, an image that three years ago would have mortified
investors instead appeared to cheer many of them: the footage of
cable TV pioneer John Rigas and two of his sons arrested in New York
and led off to court, to be criminally charged with looting
now-bankrupt Adelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Congress and the handcuffed Rigases together managed to
end the nearly 29-month-old bear market won't be known except in
retrospect many months from now, of course.</TE>
<TE>   Given the unprecedented trading volume of the last few weeks, and
with many stocks at their lowest levels in at least five years, the
sell-off simply may have reached a point of temporary exhaustion.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow gained 3% to finish at 8,264.39, while the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 edged up 0.6% to 852.84. The Nasdaq composite
recorded another losing week, falling 4.3% to 1,262.12, but that was
at least up from its closing low of 1,229 reached Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   There is precedent for believing that a federal act aimed at
cleaning up corporate America can restore investors' shattered
confidence in the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   In 1934, the passage of the Securities Exchange Act, creating the
Securities and Exchange Commission, was followed not long afterward
by a rally that lifted the Dow from 90 to about 200 by early 1937.</TE>
<TE>   As historians have noted, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's push
for serious regulation of the securities markets in the aftermath of
the 1929 market crash and the onset of the Great Depression was all
about saving capitalism from capitalists.</TE>
<TE>   The abuses visited on workers and investors by Wall Street and
corporate America in the 1920s boom years threatened to turn much of
the nation against the free-enterprise system in the 1930s. Roosevelt
saw the threat and realized he had to meet it head-on with laws that
punished wrongdoing and limited the potential for new abuses.</TE>
<TE>   This time around, despite the worst stock market decline since the
Depression (at its low point last week, the S&amp;P 500 was down 49% from
its 2000 peak), only a hopelessly romantic modern-day Marxist would
try to argue that the nation is on the verge of renouncing
capitalism.</TE>
<TE>   But there is no contesting that Americans are angry, are sickened
by the continuing revelations of outsized corporate greed and
chicanery, and that many are questioning whether the markets have
been rigged against them.</TE>
<TE>   Even if share prices have bottomed, the question is whether
millions of people who previously saw the market as the best
long-term investment vehicle no longer are so sure, and will be
reluctant to funnel their savings into stocks in coming years.</TE>
<TE>   Without faith in the financial system--including trust in
corporate accounting and a belief that management can be counted on
to act in the best interests of all shareholders, not just for
itself--there is no justification for investing in stocks. Better to
just leave your money in an insured bank account, where the worst
that can happen is that your returns won't keep up with the inflation
rate.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, large numbers of people have chosen the bank option over
the last two years, and now look brilliant for doing so. Deposits in
basic savings accounts have soared from $1.8 trillion in mid-2000 to
more than $2.5 trillion.</TE>
<TE>   Others are falling over themselves to buy Treasury bonds at yields
that are the lowest in a generation. The yield on the five-year
Treasury note fell to 3.39% on Friday, down from 3.57% at the start
of the week and the lowest since the government began regular
auctions of the securities in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   It sounds odd to call the hunger for absolute safety a mania, but
a chart tracking the increase in bank deposits since mid-2000, and
especially in recent months, looks a lot like the price charts of
technology and Internet stocks from 1998 to early 2000.</TE>
<TE>   If the masses were wrong to put every last dime into tech stocks
in the late 1990s, are they wrong today to shovel hard-earned dollars
into bank accounts that are among the lowest-paying savings
alternatives?</TE>
<TE>   For those investors who have no faith in the stock market, the
bank or bonds still make perfect sense. Ditto for those who own
stocks but have learned the hard way about the perils of being
undiversified and now are trying to rectify that.</TE>
<TE>   But for anyone who still has the means, and the intestinal
fortitude, to have money in equities, it's important to remember that
every momentous stock market decline creates bargains.</TE>
<TE>   That's the nature of the market: When panic hits, investors tend
to throw everything out at once. Professional fund managers can wind
up selling stocks they cherish, simply to meet cash-redemption
demands from fearful investors.</TE>
<TE>   Defense-related shares, for example, have crumbled with the rest
of the market in recent weeks, even though there is little
disagreement that the fundamentals of defense contractors appear very
strong in a world that has become far more dangerous since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, investors who had considered beefing-up the presence of
small and midsize stocks in their portfolios earlier this year, but
didn't do so, should take another look now: The S&amp;P index of 600
smaller stocks has fallen 25% since mid-April. The S&amp;P mid-cap stock
index is down 24% in the same period.</TE>
<TE>   But what if the market hasn't hit bottom? The problem with trying
to pick the absolute bottom in a bear market is that even if you get
it right with regard to major share indexes, individual stocks don't
all hit their nadirs on the same day, or even in the same month.</TE>
<TE>   If you're eager to buy, but you're worried that you're too
early--a legitimate fear, given the price-to-earnings valuations of
many stocks and all the other risks confronting the market--the
solution is to take it slowly: Put money to work in increments rather
than all at once.</TE>
<TE>   If you imagine the market as a mythical angry god that is
demanding sacrifices of those who had long worshipped it, there is no
way to guess when it finally will be appeased. It already has
consumed the early-retirement dreams of some, the college-funding
hopes of others and the reputations of hundreds of corporate
executives. But it may yet want more.</TE>

<LD>Workers nearing retirement age who have watched their nest eggs crack
under the weight of a 2 1/2-year bear market need to act quickly and
decisively if they want to salvage a little glitter for their golden
years.</LD>
<LD>   Even if the stock market recovers from its worst swoon in a
generation, there's not enough time for those within five years of
retirement to regain the 30% to 40% losses that many portfolios
suffered.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of hoping for salvation from the stock market, near-
retirees need to focus on things they can do that could significantly
improve their retirement prospects: spending less, saving more,
working longer or part time and securing an income stream over the
long haul.</LD>
<TE>   "The past is the past and there's nothing you can do about the
mistakes you have already made," said Christopher Jones, executive
vice president of financial research and strategy at Financial
Engines Inc. in Palo Alto.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, you have to look forward and see what you can do to be
successful. For a lot of people, that means they'll have to make some
tough choices about how long they are going to work and how much they
are going to spend."</TE>
<TE>   Here's the game plan:</TE>
<TE>   * Assess your position: First, find out whether the bear market
derailed your retirement. Take a look at what you intend to spend
after you retire and how much will be covered by Social Security and
a defined benefit pension--if you have one. Whatever isn't paid by
those sources must come from your own savings and investments.</TE>
<TE>   If Social Security and pension payments will cover the bulk of
your expenses, allowing you to withdraw no more than 2% to 4% of your
retirement savings each year, you're still fine, said Mark Brown,
partner with Denver investment and financial planning firm Brown &amp;
Tedstrom Inc. But if you will need to drain more than 6% of your
savings each year, something has to give, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people may have lost 30% of their portfolio in the past two
years, but they're not in trouble. They just have less cushion,"
Brown said. "Others are in a 'spend less' or 'work longer'
situation."</TE>
<TE>   Those who don't know how much of a gap they'll have between
retirement savings and retirement income need to draw up a retirement
budget.</TE>
<TE>   On one side of the ledger, list estimated expenses including
mortgages, car payments, income taxes, food, utilities and
entertainment costs. On the other side, list regular sources of
income, such as employer-provided pensions, Social Security, rental
income and trust fund payments.</TE>
<TE>   If the expenses exceed your expected income, the gap must be
filled by your retirement savings. For example, someone with $250,000
in retirement assets should worry if he or she needs to draw more
than $10,000 annually--4%, or $833 a month--from their savings.</TE>
<TE>   * Plan to spend less: Those who withdraw 6% or more of their
savings each year face the very real prospect of running through
their savings before they die, and they need to make adjustments,
Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, workers who are nearing retirement typically are in a
good position to make these adjustments, said Ellen Hoffman, author
of "The Retirement Catch-Up Guide" (Newmarket Press, 2002).</TE>
<TE>   The five-year period before retirement is when people usually earn
the most and have the lowest fixed expenses. Most of life's biggest
costs--buying a home, raising children and sending them to
college--are taken care of, and disposable income rises accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   In better days, those approaching retirement often used that money
to ramp up their lifestyle--traveling more and buying nicer cars and
vacation homes.</TE>
<TE>   But those who aren't well prepared for retirement would be better
off reducing their spending and using the extra cash to aggressively
pay off debts, including credit cards, car loans and even mortgages,
Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   They'll lose a valuable tax deduction if they pay off the
mortgage, but retirees who are debt-free won't have to take taxable
income out of savings to make debt payments. The net tax effect is a
wash, Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, as consumers generally pay higher rates of interest on
debts than they earn on savings, paying off a loan pays a higher
return than parking cash in something such as a money market fund.</TE>
<TE>   Planning to spend less once you're retired also helps.</TE>
<TE>   "No one ever talks about the consumer end of retirement planning,"
said John Scott, vice president of retirement policy at the American
Benefits Council in Washington. "But it's pivotal. If you spend less,
you need less saved."</TE>
<TE>   For each $50 cut in monthly spending, you reduce your savings
needs by about $10,000, assuming you'll need retirement income for
roughly 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, assuming a 5% rate of return in retirement, someone
who needs $2,000 in monthly income from their savings needs a nest
egg worth $372,563. If this person needs just $1,950 monthly,
$363,249 in savings would be sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   * Save more: Lower spending also means you have more money to
save. And the federal government recently made it possible for
individuals to put more money into tax-deductible retirement accounts
than ever before.</TE>
<TE>   Those 50 and older can contribute $12,000 annually to a 401(k),
403(b) or 457 retirement plan. Many individuals also may contribute
as much as $3,500 annually to a Roth IRA, which doesn't provide
upfront tax deductions but provides tax-free income in the fu- ture.</TE>
<TE>   Even at today's low interest rates, a couple saving the maximum
amounts in both work-based and Roth IRA accounts each year could
stockpile $167,000 over the next five years. That assumes they earn
just 3% on their money and each contributes $1,291.67 to savings each
month--the maximum allowable.</TE>
<TE>   If they have more disposable income to save, they could put that
additional money into taxable savings accounts. Each additional
$100,000 that's invested at a 5% return can generate $537 in monthly
income over 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   * Work longer: The most common advice planners give to those
unprepared for retirement is to continue working, said Ellen Boling,
a director in Deloitte &amp; Touche's financial planning practice.</TE>
<TE>   Delaying retirement even a few years can dramatically improve your
chances of hitting your retirement goals, said Jones of Financial
Engines.</TE>
<TE>   "By working an extra couple of years or taking a part-time job,
you can make a really significant difference," Jones said. "You can
go from having a 5% chance of meeting your retirement goals to having
a 70% chance."</TE>
<TE>   There are three reasons working longer has such a huge effect.
You're not draining your savings, so they can keep earning investment
returns. You'll be able to add to those savings. And by delaying
retirement, you shorten the time that your savings need to last.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a fourth reason: Social Security imposes a penalty on
anyone who takes benefits before his or her normal retirement age.
The cost of that penalty depends on how far you are from that age,
which is slowly creeping up from 65 to 67.</TE>
<TE>   If you retire early, you permanently lose 20% to 30% of your
monthly benefit. In simple terms, a person who retired three years
early could see the monthly Social Security check drop from $1,000 to
$800.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how that all can add up. A hypothetical worker plans to
retire at 62, but his $300,000 retirement fund has been whittled down
to $200,000 by the bear market.</TE>
<TE>   If he retires at 62 as planned, figuring that he'll live to 92,
that $200,000 has to last for 30 years. Assuming he can earn 5% on
his money, he can withdraw just $1,073 a month--and some, such as
Brown, would argue even that withdrawal rate is too high. After all,
you could live longer. And it's a third less than the $1,610 a month
he had expected from his $300,000 account.</TE>
<TE>   However, if he retires at 67, his savings could grow to
$256,672--assuming he can get a 5% return--and need to last 25 years.
Now his monthly income from savings is $1,500.</TE>
<TE>   If he's able to save more money over these five years--for
example, he puts an extra $1,000 a month into savings during that
period--he does even better.</TE>
<TE>   Now, instead of $256,672, he has more than $324,000--an amount
that can pay him $1,894 each month for 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   * Secure lifetime income: But what if the person in this example
doesn't die at age 92? The possibility of outliving your savings is
the reason some experts suggest individuals consider buying immediate
annuities.</TE>
<TE>   These annuities are the equivalent of buying a lifetime pension,
said Brian Cressy, director of TIAA-CREF's Los Angeles office.</TE>
<TE>   Someone putting $100,000 into an immediate annuity today would get
a guaranteed $670 monthly payment for the rest of his life, Cressy
said. The assumed interest rate on immediate annuities is fairly
modest--usually 3% to 6%.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike living off savings, an annuity has an insurance
component that guarantees that you'll never outlive your savings.</TE>
<TE>   * Get help: If you're close to retirement and your portfolio has
taken a massive hit during the current bear market, your investment
mix probably was inappropriate for your savings goals.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said he just took on a 60-year-old client who lost $2
million of his $3-million portfolio because it was so heavily
weighted in technology stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Now, not only will the client have to delay his retirement, he
will have to scale back his lifestyle expectations.</TE>
<TE>   What's tragic is that losses of this magnitude can be avoided by
diversifying your portfolio so it includes a mix of stocks, bonds and
cash that's appropriate to your age. In general, the closer you are
to retirement, the more conservative your portfolio should be--and
that means a higher proportion of bonds and cash.</TE>
<TE>   "Any credible advisor would have had him diversified," Brown said.
"For anyone who is nearing retirement, it's time to get serious about
creating a plan that's realistic."</TE>
<TE>   If you don't have the skills to go it alone--and if you suffered
massive losses in this market, you probably don't--you need to get
help.</TE>

<LD>WorldCom Files for Record Bankruptcy</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom Inc., the nation's second-largest long-distance company,
filed for bankruptcy protection, brought down by massive debt, a
shortage of cash and an accounting scandal that rocked investor
confidence.</LD>
<LD>   The Clinton, Miss.-based telecommunications giant listed $104
billion in assets in its filing for reorganization under federal
bankruptcy laws, making it the largest such case in history. The
filing was not expected to disrupt customers' service.</LD>
<TE>   WorldCom built itself into a telecommunications giant through some
75 acquisitions but along the way amassed $32 billion in debt.</TE>
<TE>   The company's financial troubles stretch across the U.S. economy,
from about 20 million residential and corporate customers to the
large and small pension funds that put nearly $30 billion into
WorldCom bonds that now are almost worthless.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors reportedly are moving quickly to bring charges
against former company officers involving their roles in an
accounting scheme that allegedly overstated revenue.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Adelphia Execs Charged With Fraud</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities arrested five former executives of Adelphia
Communications Corp., including the founder and two of his sons, and
charged them with defrauding investors out of billions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission
each filed complaints against John J. Rigas, who started Adelphia
half a century ago, two sons and two other former company executives
in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. The SEC also charged in a civil
action that Adelphia broke securities laws and failed to cooperate
with its investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Rigas, 78, and sons Michael, 48, and Timothy, 46, were arrested
and handcuffed by U.S. Postal Service inspectors in Manhattan and
charged with wire fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The complaints allege that Adelphia laid out $13 million to build
a golf course on John Rigas' land, paid for Manhattan apartments used
by Rigas family members, covered hundreds of millions of dollars of
the family's stock losses, and provided company airplanes for a Rigas
African safari and other trips without reimbursing the firm--all
without disclosing the transactions to outside board members or
investors.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia said in a statement that it supports the action taken
against its former executives but is "disappointed" that the SEC is
seeking civil penalties against the company.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Markets Give Investors</TE>
<TE>   a Break From Sell-Off</TE>
<TE>   Major blue-chip stock indexes posed modest gains last week, giving
investors a welcome respite from the relentless selling that has
gripped Wall Street this summer.</TE>
<TE>   The rebound featured a spectacular midweek rally that saw the Dow
Jones industrial average notch its biggest one-day percentage gain
since October 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Investors were cheered by congressional approval of a bill
tightening government oversight of corporate behavior and the
spectacle of Adelphia Communications Corp. executives being taken to
jail in handcuffs after their arrest on fraud charges.</TE>
<TE>   But technology and telecom stocks remained trouble spots. Despite
rallies Wednesday and Friday, the Nasdaq composite index finished
solidly in the red for the week--stretching its losing streak to four
weeks. Worries about corporate profits and accounting concerns were a
drag on tech shares, while mere survival continues to be an issue for
many telecom companies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Congress Approves Business Reform Bill</TE>
<TE>   Congress overwhelmingly approved a sweeping business reform bill,
and lawmakers pledged to consider more measures aimed at punishing
those who commit corporate crimes and restoring confidence in the
economy.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush called the congressional action a "victory for
America's shareholders and employees."</TE>
<TE>   His signature on the bill would usher in the most significant
strengthening of business regulation since the Depression era.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation will create an independent board to oversee the
accounting industry, require corporate officers to attest to the
accuracy of their company's financial statements and limit the
consulting that accounting firms can do for companies they audit.</TE>
<TE>   It also will ban personal loans from companies to their executives
and mandates new rules to prevent conflicts of interest among Wall
Street analysts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Banks Aided Enron, Senate Panel Says</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and other Wall Street
investment banks helped prop up Enron Corp. for years by arranging
more than $8 billion in complex financing transactions that boosted
the energy company's stock price and hid debt, according to research
by a Senate committee.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000 alone, the controversial funding deals helped Enron reduce
its reported debt by about 40% and inflate its operating cash flow by
50%, investigators found.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate permanent committee on investigations has been focusing
on the banks' efforts to help Enron raise more than $8 billion over
six years by arranging prepaid contracts with special-purpose
entities based offshore.</TE>
<TE>   The banks, testifying before the panel, vigorously defended their
actions, claiming that the deals they set up were legal and widely
used by other companies.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, shares of the banks plunged during the week, hit by
investors' growing fear that the institutions could face legal
liability over their dealings with Enron.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner Discloses SEC Inquiry</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner Inc. acknowledged that the Securities and Exchange
Commission had launched a "fact-finding inquiry" into the accounting
treatment of some advertising transactions at its America Online unit
in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Richard D. Parsons disclosed the investigation
during a conference call to discuss the media giant's second-quarter
earnings, which were slightly better than expected, with revenue up
10%.</TE>
<TE>   Parsons said the transactions were reviewed by Ernst &amp; Young, the
company's auditor, which concluded that they complied with accounting
standards and were properly disclosed to investors. Parsons said the
company would cooperate fully with the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC, through a spokesman, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation comes at a bad time for AOL Time Warner and
Parsons, who took over as CEO in May. Parsons is trying to repair the
company's credibility with investors, who have seen the share price
plunge 65% this year. The poor performance has cost the jobs of
former Chief Executive Gerald Levin and Chief Operating Officer
Robert W. Pittman.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tentative OK for PacBell Long-Distance Service</TE>
<TE>   SBC Pacific Bell, the state's largest local phone company, won
tentative approval to sell long-distance service in California, a
move that would radically alter the state's massive
telecommunications market and strike another blow to crippled
long-distance companies such as WorldCom Inc.</TE>
<TE>   But the landmark ruling by an administrative law judge contained a
host of conditions on how SBC PacBell can enter the long-distance
business, noting in harsh language the company's anti-competitive
behavior in selling high-speed Internet services.</TE>
<TE>   SBC PacBell praised the ruling and said it would work with the
Public Utilities Commission to address the judge's criticisms.</TE>
<TE>   But consumer advocates and rival phone companies questioned
whether the commission should endorse the move.</TE>

<LD>Convention Center--A June 16 article about the Los Angeles Convention
&amp; Visitors Bureau incorrectly stated that the agency waived rental
fees for Digital Consulting Inc. for an event staged in December at
the Los Angeles Convention Center. The company received a discount of
rental fees for a convention held in 2000, before an audit by the
city controller criticized the practice of providing discounts that
exceeded hotel bed taxes generated by the event. In the same story, a
photo caption misrepresented the statements of George Rakis, general
manager of the Convention Center. Rakis said he approved all the
rental discounts but complained that they were "done deals" by the
time they reached his desk.</LD>

<LD>Tree boards--A story in Monday's California section about community
tree boards did not make clear that the oak tree whose branches were
cut by Carolyn and Scott Scharg of Calabasas is on their neighbor's
property, not their own. Also, the article referred to "fines" paid
by individuals who cut or remove indigenous oak without permission.
The story should have made clear that those are mitigation fees that
go toward the cost of saving trees that have been damaged by
unauthorized cutting and vary depending on the cost. In the case
reported on, that cost could be between $10,000 and $40,000.</LD>

<HD>Justifying CenterLine Cuts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CenterLine, the light rail line that initially was supposed to travel
35 miles from Fullerton to Irvine, is about to shrink again. Just
weeks after the proposed length fell to 18 miles, supporters in
Irvine proposed a 12-mile line that would run from the Santa Ana
Transportation Center to Irvine City Hall. The latest section of
track to disappear would have connected City Hall with the municipal
transportation center nestled in the Irvine Spectrum.</LD>
<LD>   Word of the shortened route that will go before Irvine City
Council on Aug. 13 will create fuel for opponents who hope to torch
the light rail system as a "train to nowhere."</LD>
<LD>   Orange County Transportation Authority officials recognize the
futility of pushing CenterLine into neighborhoods where residents
don't want it. So OCTA is expected to embrace Irvine's proposal to
end the line at City Hall. Irvine Mayor Larry Agran explains the
decision by saying the train will travel "where it is wanted," which,
for now, means City Hall.</LD>
<TE>   In March 2001 the agency backed away from a 34-mile line after
acknowledging a glaring lack of public support for the plan. Last
spring, OCTA unveiled the new, 18-mile line. OCTA's challenge now is
to present a convincing argument for a 12-mile route, or to explore
other possible destinations, including UC Irvine and Santa Ana
College.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA initially told residents that the 34-mile line made economic
sense because it would serve cities that account for more than half
of Orange County's workforce and a third of its population.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, OCTA Chief Executive Art Leahy has said that the
18-mile line made sense because the alignment would run within two
miles of 500,000 residents and connect business districts and
entertainment and transportation centers.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA clearly is betting that neighborhoods with objections will
wake up once they see the real thing up and running along the 12-mile
route. Agran also believes that Irvine residents and business owners
in neighborhoods along the San Diego Creek Channel will drop their
opposition after they find out what they're missing.</TE>
<TE>   North County proponents will go a step further, arguing that
Irvine will regret its decision not to hook up CenterLine with its
transit center because Brea, Cypress and other North County cities
that want to jump on CenterLine will be in position to grab available
funding.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA has its share of detractors who argue that the agency has
never met a mass transit project it didn't like. But it's unfair to
paint CenterLine with that broad brush until the agency makes its
case.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly the burden is on OCTA to explain why the latest and
shortest proposal still makes sense.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The time warp at the Orange County Fair is evident when market
steers--big, beefy creatures destined to end up on dining room
tables--parade around the livestock ring. A county fair in a county
that has helped to define suburban?</LD>
<LD>   Why not? County fairs are creatures of government, with board
members appointed by the governor and funding gleaned from the
parimutuel betting tax. True, they're saddled with a mandate to
educate the public about agriculture, but regulators have yet to
dictate what makes a fair.</LD>
<LD>   The agricultural heritage of the Orange County Fair, which ends
today, is evident in the sights, sounds and smells of the livestock
competition. More than 1,000 county residents brought 2,100 animals
to the fairgrounds in Costa Mesa during this, the 110th annual fair.
Granted, quite a few were pet mice and hamsters with names like
Valentine and Spot. But there also were the sheep being tended by
youthful shepherds--who, for reasons best left unexplained to the
herd, wore wool garments.</LD>
<TE>   The county fair has showcased youthful 4H members who practice
old-fashioned hog calling. It also has invited hog riders--owners of
tricked-out Harley Davidsons. Traditional artists took home blue
ribbons for pieces made from clay or needlepoint; others worked with
recycled materials, including bottles, jars, boxes and cans.</TE>
<TE>   Those with a bent for traditional crafts competed for modest cash
prizes funded by such groups as the Flying Geese Quilting Guild.
Others were flying radio-controlled model airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   The Buttons and Bows Square Dancers and the California All-Star
Cloggers kicked up some dust. So did the Ballet Folklorico De
Guadalupe, the Chinese Lion Dancers and the Ko Sue Hee Korean
Dancers. The music stage included a MariachiFest, Koko Taylor &amp; Her
Blues Machine and the return of "Weird Al" Yankovic.</TE>
<TE>   The mix of past and present is common in urban and suburban areas
where fairs struggle to fulfill their societal role of celebrating
the accomplishments of everyday people. Like other fairs, the local
version must scramble for capital needed to maintain its facilities.
It also must draw the next generation of fairgoers from a decidedly
urban-suburban population with few ties to agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   Some in the fair industry fear that the hodgepodge of rural and
urban, and past and present spells doom. At least one county fair in
California has gone bankrupt. And there are those who would use prime
fairgrounds for other purposes. So in a region where the competition
includes Disneyland, glitzy movie theater complexes and snazzy
entertainment centers, the county fair must strive to remain
relevant.</TE>

<LD>The Orange County Sanitation District showed courage with its
decision to do a better job of cleaning up sewage before pumping it
into the ocean. Unfortunately, the district had backed itself into
the position of needing that bravery.</LD>
<LD>   Still, let's give credit where it's due. The district board found
itself in an ironic position July 17 when it made the environmentally
friendly decision not to seek an extension to a waiver that had
allowed the legal pumping of 120 million gallons a day of bacteria-
and virus-laden sewage into the ocean. By agreeing to let the waiver
lapse, the sanitation district has opened itself up to potential
fines of $3,000 a day for polluting the ocean, starting in July,
2003. That's a daunting prospect given that the treatment facilities
could take 11 years to build.</LD>
<LD>   Voting without assurances of protection from fines was a step into
an uncertain future for board members. State and federal officials
with the power to fine the sanitation district should not punish the
district for finally moving in the right direction. Regulators
should, however, make sure that the district moves expeditiously to
build the expanded treatment plant.</LD>
<TE>   State water officials gave the board a vote of confidence two days
after the waiver vote by allowing the district to chlorinate sewage
being pumped into the ocean. The district says it will limit the use
of chlorination and, within three to five years, switch to a nontoxic
technology, possibly ultraviolet light, to treat the sewage.</TE>
<TE>   The district should be held to that goal. Chlorination is a
problematic solution. Chlorine can produce chloroform when it reacts
with organic matter in the water. Though it kills off unwanted
bacteria, it's unclear whether chlorine also kills viruses and other
potential sources of disease.</TE>
<TE>   The district has promised to limit the amount of chlorination so
the marine environment isn't harmed. But the sewage agency hasn't
built a reputation for trustworthiness, so regulators will have to
keep close tabs on that promise.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators must carefully monitor the chlorination project and
make sure testing meets the most rigorous standards. Chlorination
cannot be allowed to evolve into a delaying tactic that pushes back
the planned move to another form of disinfection that won't be as
harsh on the ocean. Regulators also must ensure that the district
moves quickly from simple disinfection to full secondary treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The district dragged its heels for years on adopting stricter
treatment of sewage, arguing that the sewage outfall plume remained
miles offshore. This year, though, the district said that the sewage
plume had moved to within half a mile of the beach.</TE>
<TE>   The district repeatedly has maintained that treating sewage to the
national standard would be an expensive proposition that could cost
$400 million. A month ago, the board unexpectedly acknowledged that
the cost would be $270 million. Taxpayers, who will pay for the
treatment plant, must believe that they're being handed an accurate
figure.</TE>
<TE>   The sanitation district maintains that it has been forthcoming,
but after the lengthy argument over the waiver extension, the
district must convince customers that it is ready to clean up its
image by acting quickly on its promise to improve treatment. During
coming years, the district's actions clearly will speak louder than
words.</TE>

<LD>Re "That Echo Is the Last Hoof," July 15:</LD>

friend die, and I was helpless to do anything to stop it from
happening.</LD>
<LD>   I walked the very places you told about--Bee Flats, I know where
that is. There are huge trees that house large swarms of honey bees.
The air is filled by a loud humming that you feel more than hear. The
wonderful old sycamore trees have limbs larger than most trees'
trunks.</LD>
<TE>   When I first moved here 16 years ago from Pennsylvania, I hunted
for some open space to walk and retrieve a sense of peace and quiet
and beauty. I found the Irvine Ranch lands, and accompanied by my
camera, I walked and looked and took pictures of a wonderful place
that still was rather wild. I met the cowboys once. The foreman told
me to be careful, but he didn't ask me to leave--I think he knew why
I was there. By being in the right place at the right time I also got
to watch a couple of roundups.</TE>
<TE>   The beauty of that whole area is a treasure that cannot be
replaced once it's gone. It's a shame that money is so important that
places like this have to disappear. This county would be better off
if an effort were made to preserve such treasures.</TE>

<TE>   Thank you for the wonderful article about the Irvine Ranch. It was
like reading cowboy poetry. It made me wonder what we were all
thinking--moving to our own Eden and destroying it at the same time
by pushing out people who are still conquering the Old West with grit
and sweat instead of sport utility vehicles and Viking ranges. Please
keep up the excellent work. The photos were perfect.</TE>

<LD>Re "Body Found Could Be Abducted O.C. Girl," July 17:</LD>
<LD>   I just finished reading--and crying--about the death of Samantha
Runnion. As the grandmother of a 3-year-old, I am saddened and
outraged at the seemingly wanton sexual abuse of children.</LD>
<LD>   From Catholic priests to sexual predators, where does it end?
Perhaps we should be asking the question: Where does it begin?</LD>
<TE>   I cannot remember a time in my life where sexual abuse of children
has become such an integral part of our society. Is it that in
previous times, the acts took place behind closed doors and were
never mentioned? Or have the continued decline and breakdown of
"family values" contributed to the surfacing of sick and
dysfunctional members of society?</TE>
<TE>   I, like others, have many questions and no answers. I have only
pain for the families and victims, and outrage for the perpetrators.</TE>
<TE>   Let me ask this question: Do you think we as a society will sit on
the sidelines while you rob our youth of their innocence, when
treating them as enticement?</TE>
<TE>   As a mother, grandmother and member of society, I intend to do
everything in my power to ensure that your sickness and evil is
eradicated from the face of this earth.</TE>
<TE>   Anne-Mary Dytewski</TE>
<TE>   Oceanside</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   That this beautiful child was assaulted and murdered is beyond
comprehension. There probably is not one of us who would not want to
beat the perpetrator senseless given the opportunity. However, should
we, as a society, shoulder some of the blame for this inhuman act
against this child, and indeed all the other children who daily
become victims of human predators? I think we have to.</TE>
<TE>   None of us would hook a hose up to a sewer line and run it into
our homes. However, that is exactly what we have done with all of the
violence and sex on television. I can almost bet, with certainty,
that the person who abducted Samantha Runnion had access to child
porn, and when he got his fill of that, he went out for the real
thing. I think this same scenario plays out on a daily basis in the
United States and will continue unless we, as a society say no.</TE>
<TE>   Pornography, in all forms, needs to be gone from our homes, movie
theaters and computers. We will not tolerate what is
intolerable--putting our children's lives in jeopardy because we have
decided that, as a society, what we do in the privacy of our own
homes is OK. What are we willing to sacrifice as a society to help to
keep our children safe as possible?</TE>

<TE>   Re "Lake Elsinore Man Arrested in Girl's Kidnap, Slaying," July
20:</TE>
<TE>   Apparently Orange County Sheriff Michael Carona has decided to do
away with due process and take on truth and justice single-handedly.
His swaggering, self-congratulatory press conference, and the
declaration of his absolute certainty of Alejandro Avila's guilt,
decimate the notion of innocent until proved guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of what the sheriff knows, his is but one opinion.
Stating his opinion before a worldwide audience is a complete abuse
of power and position. To listen to his oratory you would think the
arrest was reason to rejoice, when in fact, it was many days too
late.</TE>

<TE>   Samantha Runnion: found dead. Elizabeth Smart: missing. Daniel
Spangle: missing since March, 1, 1989. Sabrina Aisenburg, Destiny
Bailey, Brittney Beers, Jessica Cain, Amber Hagerman, Polly Klaas,
Adam Walsh: all missing or dead.</TE>
<TE>   We could go down the alphabet, listing thousands more. Why?
Because, in the words of lawyer and child advocate Andrew Vachss,
"We, as a society, tolerate predators of our own species."</TE>
<TE>   Vachss has written that predators "like what they do ... do it
because they want to, and ... will continue to do it until
incapacitated," and that "We need to recognize that child pornography
is not 'free speech'--it is a photograph of a crime, a felony subject
to prosecution in all 50 states."</TE>
<TE>   His suggestions to keep children safe:</TE>
<TE>   * Increase the penalties for all crimes aimed at children.</TE>
<TE>   * Change the criminal justice system's labeling of predatory
behavior from a nonviolent to a violent crime.</TE>
<TE>   * Deter enablers (anyone who fails to protect a child from abuse)
by hitting them in the pocketbook.</TE>
<TE>   * Take nonviolent offenders out of prison and fill the vacancies
with child-sex predators.</TE>
<TE>   Ask your elected state officials how many more children will have
to die before we change our laws to protect them.</TE>

<TE>   Most Californians of voting age have probably heard of Megan's
Law, but know little about it. The parents of 7-year-old Megan Kanka
of New Jersey were not aware that their neighbor was a
twice-convicted sex offender until he was charged with the rape and
murder of their daughter, Megan. The parents of 4-year-old My Ly
Nghiem of Binghamton, N.Y., didn't know that a three-time convicted
sex offender lived and worked in their building until he was charged
with the rape and murder of their daughter. These crimes prompted
Megan's Law, which mandates the release of information necessary to
protect the public from high-risk sex offenders.</TE>
<TE>   Although convicted sex offenders are required to register in
California, the state is one of nine that does not provide citizens
with Internet access to help determine whether child sex offenders
live in their neighborhoods. If I want to know where sex offenders
live, I am required to go to a police station or the sheriff's office
to get the information.</TE>
<TE>   As a supposedly progressive state, we are one of the most backward
when it comes to providing a safety net for our children. We need to
change that. We need to tell our state legislators, mayors and city
council members that we want changes in the administration of Megan's
Law. Together we can make a difference.</TE>

<LD>Despite current tragedies here and abroad, the article "Kitsch and
Clutter Fading Fast in Anaheim" caught my eye. As a local baby
boomer, I remember the excitement of the fascinating signage near
Disneyland; the Peter Pan Motel's neon representation of that
"never-grow-up child" was my favorite, though the Space Age Motor
Lodge was a close second. I wanted so much to stay in their rooms,
swim in their pools and take one of their motel shuttles to
Disneyland ... even though we lived in Orange!</LD>
<LD>   As for the destruction of Melodyland, it shouldn't have to be.
Among the many wonderful productions our family attended at the
theater-in-the-round were "The Music Man" with Miss America pageant
emcee Bert Parks, "High Button Shoes" with legendary actress Betty
Grable and "Finnegan's Rainbow" with "Mr. Ed" star Alan Young. We
were sitting in the back row watching various grandchildren of "The
King Family" sing when King cousin Tina Cole and "My Three Sons"
actor Don Grady stood behind us.</LD>
<LD>   Then, just as I was learning about British history and Oliver
Cromwell's suppression of theaters, Melodyland was transformed into a
church--and now this distinctive meeting hall is about to be turned
into scrap. What an abomination.</LD>

<TE>   Your article on the "Kitsch and Clutter" of Anaheim failed to
delve deeply into the $6-billion financing of the "massive overhaul."</TE>
<TE>   One small example: While residents of Anaheim have had to
underwrite the immediate costs of underground utilities around
Disneyland, they will not see the same underground utilities near
their homes until well into the 21st century. And how about the money
that the city has spent supporting Disney's utility upgrades?</TE>
<TE>   Of course, when the rest of Anaheim suffered from a pileup of
garbage during the trash strike, the city ensured that Disneyland's
trash was removed.</TE>

Big Rat.</TE>

<LD>Re "Build Foothill South, Voters Say in Survey," July 12:</LD>
<LD>   So the recent survey that shows strong support for the Foothill
South tollway is "PR gimmickry," according to Sierra Club
representative Bill Corcoran.</LD>
<LD>   Corcoran seems befuddled by the support, since he says there "are
no real traffic forecasts yet."</LD>
<TE>   I have a suggestion for Corcoran: Go sit on the parking lot we
call Interstate 5 on the weekend.</TE>

<TE>   And it's only going to get worse unless something is done.</TE>

<HD>Strawberry Growers Pick Up the Pace</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: The county's 2002 harvest has already broken
the single-year record as farmers devote more land to the crop.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County strawberry growers reaped a record harvest this year,
as good weather and an expanded number of plantings combined to fuel
production.</LD>
<LD>   Through mid-July, county growers had pumped out 26.6 million trays
of berries. That compares with 21.4 million trays during the same
period last year and 23.4 million trays for all of 2001, the previous
record yield.</LD>
<LD>   Although the main harvest is all but over now, the bumper crop has
accounted for one-third of all strawberries picked statewide so far
this year.</LD>
<TE>   And while the value of those berries won't be known for months,
several growers said prices this season were as high as they have
been in years.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a spectacular strawberry year for anyone involved in the
industry in Ventura County," said Oxnard grower Christopher
Deardorff, who farms 200 acres of strawberries near Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only was production up, but prices were fabulous," the
fourth-generation grower said. "I think we are seeing an influx of
[growers] moving into the area because this is one of the premier
growing districts in the state."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last decade, no area of the state has planted more new
strawberry acreage than Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   It remains California's second-largest strawberry-producing region
behind the Watsonville/Salinas area, according to the California
Strawberry Commission.</TE>
<TE>   County growers had 8,582 acres in production this year, a 10%
increase over last year and double the acreage dedicated to
strawberries a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   The added acreage accounts in part for the boost in production,
growers say. However, farmers say they benefited this year from an
extremely cold winter followed by a cool, dry spring. The cold
temperatures held back early-season production, prompting the harvest
to explode in the spring and early summer.</TE>
<TE>   Agricultural officials say that kind of success has made Ventura
County a desirable place for strawberry growers to set up operations.</TE>
<TE>   And it has firmly placed strawberries among the top cash crops in
the county's $1-billion agricultural industry.</TE>
<TE>   The crop was valued at $186 million in 2000, second only to
lemons.</TE>
<TE>   "The market has been awfully good for strawberry growers," county
Agricultural Commissioner Earl McPhail said. "When you look at the
crop report, the total dollar value keeps going up every year."</TE>
<TE>   Not all the news is good on the strawberry front.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County farmland is now among the priciest in California,
largely because of demand for the fertile strawberry-growing soil of
the Oxnard Plain.</TE>
<TE>   Prime strawberry acreage sold for as much as $49,000 an acre last
year, nearly double the top prices recorded in 1994, according to a
survey by the American Society of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers.</TE>
<TE>   But while landowners have benefited from a boost in values, the
high prices have made it hard for newcomers--particularly small
farmers--to break into the business.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the higher values also have translated into higher
rents, making it increasingly difficult for tenant farmers to make a
profit.</TE>
<TE>   Take Northern California-based Global Ag, a coalition of
Watsonville-area strawberry growers who attempted two years ago to
break into the competitive market to the south.</TE>
<TE>   The company paid $2,500 an acre to rent 20 to 30 acres near
Oxnard, spokesman Charles Boyles said.</TE>
<TE>   The group set up another strawberry-growing operation in Baja
California.</TE>
<TE>   The Baja operation was a big money loser while the Oxnard farm
barely broke even. Boyles sent a letter this month to county
officials alerting them that Global Ag would be shutting its Oxnard
operation and laying off dozens of workers.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to give our employees fair warning that come September,
when they would expect to be coming back, there will be no more
Global Ag," Boyles said. "It's a tough deal down there. But I'm sure
there will be someone in line behind us ready to grab that land."</TE>
<TE>   Encouraged in part by this year's boost in production and solid
prices, veteran Camarillo grower Michael Conroy is among those
betting on a bull market.</TE>
<TE>   After he was unable this year to fully meet customer demand,
Conroy said he decided to increase his strawberry operation next year
to 150 acres--a 50% increase.</TE>
<TE>   Now he is just hoping he made the right decision.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no guarantees, it's a crapshoot at best," he said.
"There are so many new players in this business, and we're just like
everyone else trying to find our particular niche."</TE>

<HD>Island's Wild Pigs Destroying 8,000 Years of Chumash
History</HD>
<DH>Archeology: Swine on Santa Cruz ruin artifacts as they root
for food. The animals are targeted for eradication next year, but
that may be too late.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a Santa Cruz Island bluff high over the ocean, Sam Spaulding
looked helplessly among ragged holes and uprooted fennel plants at
scattered mounds of Chumash artifacts.</LD>
<LD>   "This chunk of material is not in its natural state," said
Spaulding, an archeologist for Channel Islands National Park. "The
pigs moved it. It's out of place, out of time. It doesn't have any
credible place in the story of this site. It's like ripping the page
out of a book."</LD>
<LD>   The earth around him looks like a battlefield, punctured with
holes 3 or 4 feet deep. The midden--an ancient Chumash trash heap of
shells, bone, pottery fragments and other material--has been
scattered, rendering it virtually useless to archeologists. Whatever
story unfolded on this remote, wind-swept point and other spots
throughout the island is destined to remain untold.</LD>
<TE>   More than 8,000 years of human history here are being destroyed by
wild pigs digging up ancient burial sites and mangling artifacts in a
place where the Chumash believe their tribe was created.</TE>
<TE>   "It's devastating," said Jeanne Arnold, a UCLA anthropology
professor who has done work on Santa Cruz for 24 years. "They can dig
2- or 3-foot holes in a matter of minutes. They are destroying the
heritage of the Chumash people out there."</TE>
<TE>   Park officials estimate that nearly all 687 identified
archeological sites on the island have been damaged by pigs, which
are targeted for eradication beginning next year. Archeologists
estimate there are at least twice as many additional sites that have
not yet been identified.</TE>
<TE>   Pigs root for moisture-packed fennel bulbs and Jerusalem crickets
on the 65,000-acre island, the largest in the Channel Island chain.</TE>
<TE>   "The archeological sites on the Channel Islands are a wonderful
treasure," said John Johnson, curator of anthropology at the Santa
Barbara Museum of Natural History. "But the pigs are disrupting our
ability to interpret the upper layers of the site. Shell ornaments,
objects made of bone and burial relics will be scattered. The ability
of an archeologist to reconstruct past life ways depends on the
ability to re-create the lives of those who lived there. Once it's
disturbed, you can no longer tell the story."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Cruz, once the most densely populated island off the
California coast, was at one time home to 2,000 residents and 10
villages.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists believe the island's inhabitants ran the equivalent of
a mint for tribes throughout Southern California. The name Chumash,
they say, is derived from the word "alchum," the tribal term for
money. The islanders used shells, like those of the purple olive
snail, to make small, delicate bead money that they exchanged with
mainland tribes for acorns and deer meat.</TE>
<TE>   The stone tools, fine chert knife blades, mortars and pestles date
as far back as 8000 B.C. Archeologists have also found village sites
and houses below the surface. On nearby Santa Rosa Island, the bones
of a 13,000-year-old woman were found at a place called Arlington
Springs, and on San Miguel Island, a few miles away, a 10,000-
year-old woven child's sandal was discovered in a cave.</TE>
<TE>   "The pigs are uprooting the resting place of these people, my
ancestors," said Julie Tumamait-Stenslie, a Chumash woman whose
great-grandparents grew up on the island before it was abandoned in
the early 1800s. "I don't like the idea of killing animals, but they
are not native to the place and it has to be done for the greater
good of Santa Cruz Island."</TE>
<TE>   Fences have been put around some of the most significant sites,
but the swine just dig under them.</TE>
<TE>   The pigs, whose numbers are estimated at up to 4,000, descended
from a domestic herd kept on the island by one M.J. Box of Santa
Barbara in the early 1850s. Somehow more than 200 escaped, eventually
becoming wild. They are hairy, occasionally tusked and, when food is
plentiful, can double their population every four months, biologists
say.</TE>
<TE>   Though the animals have been around for 150 years, the porcine
effect on archeology has increased. About 15 years ago, the National
Park Service removed thousands of grazing sheep, reducing competition
for food and creating a pig population boom.</TE>
<TE>   "Around the time the sheep got off the island, it got bad, and in
the past few years it's gotten worse," said Michael Glassow, chairman
of the anthropology department at UC Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, the park service killed the pigs on Santa Rosa
Island, and it is planning to do the same on Santa Cruz beginning
next year. The pigs will be trapped and shot.</TE>
<TE>   Animal rights advocates have urged park officials to shoot the
animals with contraceptives so the herd can die off on its own. But
officials say the idea is impractical and time-consuming. Further,
the pigs don't taste good and they can't be taken off the island
because some carry disease.</TE>
<TE>   Kate Faulkner, chief of natural resources management for Channel
Islands National Park, said the extensive damage by the pigs leaves
little choice.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way to protect the sites is to eradicate the pigs," she
said.</TE>

<HD>State Budget Talks Going Nowhere, Slowly</HD>
<DH>Government: Davis says it's up to legislators. Even with
his pay and theirs suspended, no deal seems likely any time soon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julie Tamaki</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis has said he has no plans to negotiate with Republican
leaders on a new state budget, and for the most part he has kept his
word. Until last week.</LD>
<LD>   Attracting a crush of television cameras, Davis met Thursday with
the Assembly's Democratic and Republican leaders for the first time
since the $99-billion spending package failed to clear the lower
house last month, causing him to miss a July 1 deadline for signing a
new budget.</LD>
<LD>   The outcome of the two-hour huddle: Assembly Republican Leader
Dave Cox (R-Fair Oaks) emerged and told reporters that he would not
characterize the talks as negotiations. Later in the day, GOP
Assemblyman John Campbell of Irvine had one word to describe the
direction talks appeared to be heading: "Nowhere."</LD>
<TE>   For their part, Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) said
the meeting brought a "little bit of progress," and Davis reiterated
his belief that he had already done his part by proposing a budget.
Now, he said, it was up to the Legislature to pass a plan.</TE>
<TE>   And so it goes as California approaches its one-month anniversary
without a state budget--a situation that is causing 2,400 legislative
employees and thousands of vendors who provide the state with goods
and services to go unpaid.</TE>
<TE>   The list of casualties will grow this week because of a decision
by State Controller Kathleen Connell to halt paychecks for lawmakers
and other elected state officials, including herself and Davis, until
a spending package has been approved.</TE>
<TE>   Connell's decision landed her on CNN. The cable news channel
conducted an informal poll of viewers, who were asked to vote on
whether Connell should suspend the pay of all elected officials for
failing to balance the budget, as they are required to do.</TE>
<TE>   The viewers' response: 95% yes.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the proposals state officials are relying on to help close
the $23.6-billion projected shortfall are also at risk. A 63-cent
hike in the state excise tax levied on cigarettes, for example, is
scheduled to kick in on Thursday, but officials can't collect the
higher tax until lawmakers approve the increase as part of the
spending package.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, plans to bolster certain tax collections that would
generate millions of dollars to help get the state out of the red are
also on hold.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also contends that California's ability to fight forest
fires and help AIDS patients is in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate approved a spending package last month, but it remains
stalled in the Assembly, where Republicans are blocking it because it
contains nearly $4 billion in new taxes and other new revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans want additional cuts to diminish the need for tax
hikes, but any changes to the plan must pass muster with the Senate
and with Davis.</TE>
<TE>   In previous years, Davis and his GOP predecessors, Govs. Pete
Wilson and George Deukmejian, held what are referred to around the
Capitol as "Big Five" meetings. In addition to the governor,
participants traditionally included the leading Democrats and
Republicans from each house of the Legislature--the folks with the
clout to hammer out big deals.</TE>
<TE>   This year, however, Davis has called no such meetings as he and
his staff have gone about trying to persuade any four Assembly
Republicans--the minimum needed to approve the spending package--to
vote with the Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, for several weeks now, Wesson and Cox have been
meeting regularly with four Assembly legislators from each party,
prompting one participant to jokingly dub the gatherings the "Puny
10." With no apparent progress being made, the word around the
Capitol is that the earliest time something is likely to break is
when the Senate returns from its summer holiday on Aug. 5.</TE>
<TE>   The lull has given rise to plenty of partisan finger-pointing but,
amid the rhetoric, the status quo reigns.</TE>
<TE>   Republican Assemblyman Campbell notes that Democrats have balked
at billions of dollars in spending cuts that could make tax hikes
unnecessary. He also contends that Democrats haven't floated a
counterproposal.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell, an Orange County car dealer, used an automotive analogy
to spell out what has been going on during the past few weeks'
numerous budget talks.</TE>
<TE>   "You go into a car dealership and the price on the car is $30,000
and you tell the dealer you'll pay $26,000 and he says nothing.
You're not going to go back and say you'll pay $28,000 because the
dealer hasn't said anything," Campbell said.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell also wondered why Assembly Republicans should reach an
agreement with their Democratic counterparts in the Assembly without
the blessing of Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) or Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "We need the governor to be a party in the negotiations and not
just a person in the room," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson said that, while Democrats need to respect Republicans,
Democrats control the state for a reason: "The majority of
Californians are in tune with the core values that we as Democrats
share and will passionately fight for."</TE>

<HD>$1-Million Check Isn't in the Mail</HD>
<DH>Fraud: L.A. County and Santa Monica still seek to recoup
loss from a postal theft last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The amount the thief made off with was breathtaking: more than $1
million in public funds for the Santa Monica bus system. But the
scheme wasn't exactly the stuff of a Hollywood heist flick.</LD>
<LD>   All it took was a few forged signatures--and possibly a letter
opener.</LD>
<LD>   For the last year, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service has been
trying to figure out who stole a check for $1,075,408.08, which Los
Angeles County issued to the Big Blue Bus in April 2001. Like many
big-money checks issued by the county, it was to be sent across town
in the mail.</LD>
<TE>   The unknown thief was able to intercept the check, deposit it in a
Colorado brokerage account without an endorsement, then withdraw most
of the money from the account, according to officials and allegations
in court documents.</TE>
<TE>   Postal Inspector Gene Griffin said he is investigating the
incident as part of a larger series of check-fraud scams in the Los
Angeles area. But he would not give any other details--including when
or where he believes the check was snatched.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, attorneys for Santa Monica and the county are trying to
recoup the $1 million, plus interest. They have joined a multi-party
civil suit in Colorado's Boulder County District Court, where a judge
will determine who should be responsible--at least for now--for the
loss.</TE>
<TE>   The brokerage firm, Robert W. Baird &amp; Co., has put replacement
funds into an account under the control of the court, but it has
argued that it shouldn't have to give the money up, said Thomas M.
Tyrrell, senior deputy counsel for the county. Tyrrell is confident
the money will be returned to L.A. "We're in an extremely strong
position," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For some, like Santa Monica Councilman Bob Holbrook, the county's
reliance on the mail to move large amounts of money is surprising in
the age of electronic banking and increasingly sophisticated mail
theft rings.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe that someone would just put a million-dollar
check in an envelope," said Holbrook, who noted that the city has
moved other money around to cover the loss for the time being.</TE>
<TE>   However, public auditors across the country maintain that the U.S.
Postal Service still provides a safe and effective way to move large
amounts of money. Most county auditors in California still regularly
drop large checks in the mail, said Gere Sibbach, president of the
state Assn. of County Auditors. The same goes for controller's
offices for the state of California and New York City.</TE>
<TE>   The lost money was part of Santa Monica's yearly allotment of
regional transportation funding generated by local sales taxes, and
administered by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</TE>
<TE>   The check, which was supposed to have been mailed from the county
auditor-controller's office, is the largest potential single loss
from check fraud the county has faced in recent memory, said Maria
Oms, the county's assistant auditor-controller.</TE>
<TE>   Since the check disappeared, the county has given up on mailing
funds to the Big Blue Bus and switched to electronic bank transfers,
Oms said. But she said the county continues to send out many of its
six- and seven-figure checks in the mail.</TE>
<TE>   Moving money through the mail comes with other dangers besides
theft. John Gill, general counsel for the Assn. of Certified Fraud
Examiners, said a $1-million check was erroneously mailed to his
office two years ago by New York transit officials.</TE>
<TE>   But public agencies take comfort in anti-fraud measures built into
the banking system, as well as an assumption that few people would be
so audacious as to try to illegally cash or deposit a $1-million
government check. All say the successful theft of large government
checks through the mail is rare.</TE>
<TE>   William Haslinger, a professor of economic crime at Hilbert
College in New York, was surprised that Baird would have accepted
such a large check without an endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   "Accepting something like that without an endorsement is like
accepting a blank piece of paper," he said. "It leads one to wonder
just how much [information] these fraudsters had to give them to open
that account."</TE>
<TE>   Baird spokesman John Rumpf would not comment on the case or the
company's protocols for establishing an account, citing the pending
litigation.</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents, the account was opened at Baird's
Boulder branch office on May 8, 2001, under the name "Santa Monica
Big Blue Bus Tour." It was signed with the forged signature "J.B.
Catoe." John B. Catoe was the name of the real director of Big Blue
Bus at the time.</TE>
<TE>   After receiving the unendorsed check, Baird deposited it May 11,
2001, at its own financial institution, First National Bank of
Colorado, stamping its own endorsement on the back.</TE>
<TE>   FNBC has filed a lawsuit asking a Colorado judge to decide who
should get the replacement money--Baird or Los Angeles County's bank,
Bank of America. In the suit, FNBC says it is "in great doubt as to
which of the defendants is entitled to the funds," and is concerned
about exposure to "double or multiple liability."</TE>
<TE>   Jeanette Schachtner, a Santa Monica assistant city attorney, said
Santa Monica did not realize the money was missing until an audit at
the end of the fiscal year, in July 2001. More recently, the city and
county have grown impatient with the speed of the FNBC lawsuit. Last
month, they intervened in the action, accusing both Baird and FNBC of
accepting the check without an adequate endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County auditors are used to a certain amount of fraud
and forgery, given the large amounts of money they deal with. In the
2001-2002 fiscal year, the office issued $9.2 billion in checks and
payments to various vendors, residents and agencies. During that
time, in addition to the $1-million check, county investigators
looked into $375,000 in forgeries and fraud, Oms said. Most of that
money was repaid by the banks that accepted the bad checks, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The last time the auditor's office had serious mail theft problems
was the mid-1990s, when thieves were mugging both postal carriers and
welfare recipients on the first of the month--the date the county
mailed out CalWORKS checks.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the office stopped mailing welfare payments, instead
making them available for pickup at neighborhood check-cashing
stores. Postal Inspector Pamela Prince said the problem vanished
nearly overnight.</TE>
<TE>   The $1-million check is not the only one that has disappeared on
its way to the Big Blue Bus.</TE>
<TE>   According to Schachtner, two other checks that were supposed to be
sent from the MTA's offices in July 2001 also are missing and
considered stolen. They totaled about $67,000, she said. Those thefts
are under investigation by the MTA's inspector general, a spokesman
said.</TE>

<HD>Children's Unsolved Murders Add Questions to the Pain</HD>
<DH>Crime: Fourteen kids in the state have been abducted and
killed by strangers since 1991. Six cases remain open.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RAY F. HERNDON and JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than a decade has passed, but hardly a day goes by that
Oceanside police Det. Sheila Potkonjak doesn't think about the
7-year-old girl whose photograph is tacked to the bulletin board in
her office.</LD>
<LD>   The Easter picture of Leticia Hernandez, holding a baby chick in
her hands, is a constant reminder of the biggest case of the
detective's career, an abduction and murder that remains unsolved.</LD>
<LD>   "It never goes away," Potkonjak said. "You wonder what we could do
differently or could have done differently to solve such cases."</LD>
<TE>   Her questions are all the more painful now, days after Samantha
Runnion was kidnapped from in front of her Orange County home and
later killed. The Runnion investigation--like the high-profile case
nine years ago of Polly Klaas in Petaluma--ended with a relatively
quick arrest.</TE>
<TE>   But many other cases of children abducted and murdered are not
resolved. The television cameras and news helicopters clear out and
detectives move on to other cases. Families--and the community--are
left to go on without knowing who is responsible for the crime, and
whether the killer lives among them.</TE>
<TE>   The number of child abduction-murders by strangers is small;
California police agencies have reported just 13 such crimes, aside
from the Runnion case, since 1991 that involve victims 12 and
younger. Half of those cases remain unsolved--including that of a
Beaumont boy whose face still haunts a billboard five years after his
death and that of a Chula Vista girl who was snatched in 1991 when
answering a nighttime knock on her home's front door.</TE>
<TE>   The posters are still plastered in windows of businesses on
Beaumont's main street. They show a photo of smiling, fresh-faced
Anthony Martinez, 10. Next to it is a drawing of an anonymous,
mustached man 25 to 35 years old, wearing a dark baseball cap.</TE>
<TE>   This is the man who kidnapped Anthony on April 4, 1997, and killed
him--a man who has never been found.</TE>
<TE>   Beaumont is a desert town of 12,000 people, known for its cherry
festival and antique stores that pull people off the highway on their
way to Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   The town is small enough that nearly everyone has some emotional
tie to the murder. Parents know their kids played Little League with
Anthony or went to the same school or they see his parents downtown.
Maybe they were among the hundreds who took part in the search, from
the time he was kidnapped at knifepoint until that day two weeks
later when his body was found buried under rocks near Indio.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony's murder is always just below the surface in Beaumont.
When a child like Samantha is killed, the memories burst through.
Erin Ohler, owner of the Country Junction restaurant on 6th Street,
loses the battle to hold back tears as she talks about Anthony. The
boy was kidnapped just a couple of blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   "When [Alejandro Avila] was arrested for killing Samantha, people
thought, 'Yes,' " Ohler said, banging her fist on the table. "They
were really hoping this was the same guy."</TE>
<TE>   But when detectives announced that Avila was not a suspect in
Anthony's murder, the hopefulness in the town turned back to despair
and apprehension.</TE>
<TE>   "It brought everything back, and [we] are angry," Ohler said.
"There is no closure for this family. And this guy is not caught."</TE>
<TE>   At the city-run day camp, counselors have been ordered to keep a
closer watch on the campers. Now, when kids use the bathroom at the
park or at the swimming pool, counselors must go inside the restroom
with them, instead of waiting outside or watching from a distance.</TE>
<TE>   Things are worst, of course, for Anthony's family. His photos
decorate the house, along with those of his brother Marcos, 11, and
sister Monica, 9. He was a happy baby, posed to look as if he were
reading the newspaper; a smiling fifth-grader; and the kid with the
mischievous smile, just waiting to get into trouble.</TE>
<TE>   When another child is kidnapped, the calls start coming from
friends, relatives and reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "It brings back all those feelings," said Anthony's stepfather,
Ernesto Medina, who raised the boy as a son from age 1. "It tears you
apart all over again. You feel so bad."</TE>
<TE>   Struggling to Carry On</TE>
<TE>   In the four years since her little boy was murdered, Melissa
Michael has often asked herself whether she has the strength to go
on.</TE>
<TE>   Isaiver Teague, 4, of Oakland was visiting his father in Fresno
when he and his 16-year-old aunt disappeared while walking to a
nearby phone booth in July 1998. They were going to call Isaiver's
grandmother. They never made the call.</TE>
<TE>   A man walking through a field two miles away came across their
skeletons four months later. During that time, dogs had found the
bones and spread them over a half-mile area. The bodies were
decomposed so badly that police can't tell how they were killed.
"Homicidal violence of undetermined nature," is what the death
certificates say.</TE>
<TE>   Michael is 24, a child herself when Isaiver was born in 1994. "I
used to see things like this happen on TV and think it will never
happen to me," she said, "and it did happen to me."</TE>
<TE>   What keeps her going is her eldest son, Isaiah, 10, two years
older than Isaiver would have been.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to keep myself right, and my son right," she said. "I'm
still going crazy."</TE>
<TE>   She tries to put the case out of her mind, but it proves
impossible. Instead, she fixates on the killer and complains about
the case never being solved. She holds out hope that catching the
killer will somehow calm her.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a heavy load is on you, and you want to get it off your
chest. It can never be closed until they find him. I just want to
know why they did this to my son. He was a young boy. I just don't
understand why. I want to know why, and that's on my mind."</TE>
<TE>   3 Keys to Solving Cases</TE>
<TE>   Why some child abduction-murders are solved, while others may
never be, is something Potkonjak, the Oceanside police detective,
often contemplates when she thinks of Leticia Hernandez.</TE>
<TE>   In the Samantha Runnion case, she said, Orange County authorities
were fortunate to have the three most critical ingredients for
success: timely notice, a good eyewitness and physical evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha's playmate was able to provide a detailed description of
the kidnapper, and the crime was reported to police almost instantly.</TE>
<TE>   Leticia's parents, however, did not report her disappearance from
the front yard of their home until 9 p.m., four hours after the fact.</TE>
<TE>   The search for witnesses to Leticia's abduction proved fruitless,
and a shortage of Spanish-speaking officers to canvass the
neighborhood hampered the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a huge problem for us," Potkonjak recalled, "having no
witnesses. There was no one who saw her get in a car or be taken by
someone. We were starting at ground zero with no information. And
then it was primarily a Spanish-speaking neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Leticia's remains were discovered 15 months later near a road
between the Pala Indian reservation and the Riverside County line,
about 20 miles from her home. Exposure to the elements had long since
erased evidence.</TE>
<TE>   A convicted child molester who lived down the street from Leticia
became a suspect. But a case couldn't be built, and no one else was
arrested for the slaying. Leticia's mother died of cancer five years
ago. Her father has returned to his native Mexico.Potkonjak's hope
that Leticia's murder might still be solved was bolstered last year
when colleagues in San Diego cracked a similar case that had been
cold for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Sellers, 9, and a 13-year-old playmate disappeared March
27, 1993, while riding on a dry lake bed not far from their south San
Diego homes. Their bodies were discovered three days later by an
adult bicyclist who rode the same trails.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego police never closed the investigation, even producing a
four-minute TV docudrama in 2000 they hoped would jolt the public's
memory and produce more leads. They finally got a break in the spring
of 2001, linking DNA evidence from the crime scene to an inmate in a
state prison. Authorities allege the killer is Scott Erskine, who was
serving a 70-year sentence in the state prison in Lancaster for the
rape of a San Diego woman only months after the boys were slain. His
trial is next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe [this] will prompt someone who knows something to have the
courage to come forward and help us solve Leticia's murder,"
Potkonjak said. "I haven't given up hope."</TE>

<HD>Editor Defied, Survived Drug Cartel</HD>
<DH>Journalism: Jesus Blancornelas survived a murder attempt
after exposing Tijuana's Arellano Felix gang.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE-MARIE O'CONNOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TIJUANA</DL>
<LD>Is there anything that could persuade muckraking Tijuana journalist
Jesus Blancornelas to lay down his pen?</LD>
<LD>   A nearly successful assassination attempt by the Tijuana drug
cartel failed to silence him. He waves away the inconvenience of life
with 13 army bodyguards as just another bizarre plot twist in his
episodic career.</LD>
<LD>   And indeed, the bearded and bespectacled Blancornelas--with his
classic khakis, crisp white shirts and dry wit--seems more like a
slumming college literature professor than the editor of the city's
premier investigative journal.</LD>
<TE>   Yet his gritty, take-no-prisoners reportage is legend on both
sides of the border. The New York-based Committee to Protect
Journalists once anointed him "the spiritual godfather of modern
Mexican journalism."</TE>
<TE>   "Many people told me I should retire after the 'accident,' " said
Blancornelas, 65, employing a gentle euphemism for his
near-execution. "A lot of my friends said, 'Move to the United States
and get lost.' "</TE>
<TE>   He's still here. Today the award-winning journalist is unveiling a
story few live to tell in a new book, "The Cartel: The Arellano
Felixes: The Most Powerful Mafia in the History of Latin America."</TE>
<TE>   Blancornelas still does not dare promote it publicly in Tijuana.
Published in July in Spanish by Mexico City's Plaza &amp; Janes,
Blancornelas' book peers into the secret lives of the disco-loving
Tijuana drug lords who partied their way to hegemony. But its most
intriguing tale may well be that of Blancornelas.</TE>
<TE>   In an era when journalism sometimes careens closer to "Hard Copy"
than Watergate, Blancornelas has stubbornly made his Zeta newsweekly
an indispensable institution that lends a whole new meaning to public
service.</TE>
<TE>   Notorious cartel gunmen might elude arrest--but not Blancornelas'
irate indictment. Gunmen find their photos staring sullenly back at
them from Zeta's cover. When Tijuana authorities fail to make sense
of high-profile murders, stunned citizens turn to Zeta for an
explanation.</TE>
<TE>   Blancornelas abandoned his relentless coverage only once--and not
voluntarily--when cartel gunmen attacked him, killing his bodyguard,
Luis Valero, as they drove down a busy street at midday on Nov. 27,
1997. Blancornelas did something unheard of: He survived.</TE>
<TE>   He began his next column from his convalescence bed: "Thanks to
God, my faithful friend Luis Valero, and the marvels of medical
science, I am alive."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Zeta is produced from a barely marked office that is a
virtual safe house. On a recent sun-drenched day, a scowling tough
guy parked in front of Zeta climbed out of a battered car with a
missing headlight, pulling his shirt over a 9-millimeter
semiautomatic pistol. No problem: He's one of Blancornelas'
bodyguards.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the courtly Blancornelas sits down under a poster of
beatific winged cherubs, pours a visitor a cup of coffee, and talks
about the days, two decades ago, when Zeta was at the forefront of a
new wave of investigative journalism emerging from Mexico's heavily
censored press.</TE>
<TE>   Baja California was a vanguard then of a political opposition
movement--the National Action Party--that in 1989 produced modern
Mexico's first opposition governor, and today, its first opposition
president, Vicente Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Co-Founded Zeta in 1980</TE>
<TE>   Born in San Luis Potosi in central Mexico, Blancornelas began as a
sportswriter in 1955. He moved to Tijuana in 1960 and became Baja
editor of El Mexicano. He said border corruption stories bounced him
out of three publications before he co-founded the weekly ABC.</TE>
<TE>   After ABC's government exposes met with a hostile reception,
Blancornelas fled to San Diego and co-founded Zeta with a colleague,
Hector Felix Miranda, in 1980. They distributed it across the border
and then reinstated themselves in Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Five years later, Zeta broke the story of the arrival of the
Arellano Felix brothers, who would become the leaders of the Tijuana
drug cartel, in a cover story on a marijuana warehouse guarded by
local police. Blancornelas said he did not realize its significance
until plainclothes officers bought all 20,000 copies. He republished
the issue--emblazoning "Censored!" on the cover--and Zeta was on the
map.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone was happy about that, or with Felix Miranda's
crusading column. Zeta's office was sprayed with bullets in 1987.
Gunmen killed Felix Miranda in 1988 on his way to work. Authorities
convicted two men of the murder, both security guards for the
racetrack run by Jorge Hank Rhon--the Tijuana-based son of one of
Mexico's most powerful men and a frequent target of Felix Miranda's
column.</TE>
<TE>   But the murder was never completely solved. Every week since,
Blancornelas has run a letter signed with Felix Miranda's name,
demanding: "Jorge Hank Rhon: Why did your bodyguard assassinate me?"</TE>
<TE>   Zeta won a reprieve with the 1989 groundbreaking election of an
opposition Baja governor, Ernesto Ruffo Appel, whose PAN party would
break the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party's hold on national
politics, but would disappoint people eager to see drug corruption
curbed in Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   By 1997, drug violence was a news staple in Tijuana, with an avid
following, Blancornelas noted wryly, "like sports." In those days,
there were so many prominent victims of drug murders--police chiefs,
prosecutors, political party activists--that Blancornelas published
occasional lists with titles such as "Organogram of Death."</TE>
<TE>   Blancornelas was assigned three state judicial police bodyguards
that May. Two months later, suspected narcotics gunmen killed
Benjamin Flores, the editor of a muckraking weekly in San Luis Rio
Colorado, across the border from Yuma, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   But such threats failed to temper Blancornelas' zeal when a
Tijuana matron, Maria Castanos, came to his office in October 1997 to
request a very strange full-page ad. Castanos had written a letter to
a cartel leader, Ramon Arellano Felix, demanding to know why he had
killed her two sons, who had been, she explained, his most loyal
servants.</TE>
<TE>   Attempted Execution</TE>
<TE>   The letter "angered Ramon," Blancornelas said. "He hated bad
publicity." Blancornelas reproduced the letter free, on the front
page, in early November.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope you live long enough to know how painful it is to lose
children," Castanos wrote in an angry scrawl. "P.S. You can order me
killed whenever you want. I am ready to give my life."</TE>
<TE>   It was Castanos' adult daughter who was killed, by gunmen who also
wounded her baby, as she and her husband took out the trash,
Blancornelas reports in his book, in an apparent violation of mafia
family values that bar reprisals against uninvolved family members.</TE>
<TE>   Next, Blancornelas ran a cover story on David Barron Corona, who
was believed to be a link between the Mexican Mafia and the Tijuana
drug cartel. Zeta doctored Barron's grainy, low-quality portrait
Warhol-style, in neon pinks and yellows.</TE>
<TE>   It was not the best time to spotlight fugitive gunmen: An alleged
cartel lieutenant, Arturo Paez, had just been arrested in Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   But, oddly, it was precisely at this time that Blancornelas' state
judicial police bodyguards began to refuse to report for duty,
leaving Blancornelas protected only by his personal bodyguard, Luis
Valero.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, a dark sport utility vehicle pulled alongside
Blancornelas' car, a window rolled down and a gunman fired from the
back seat. Valero ordered Blancornelas to the floor and covered him
with his body.</TE>
<TE>   Blancornelas--struck in the neck, lung, liver, intestines and
dangerously close to his spine--managed to crawl out from under his
dying bodyguard and call for help on the car's shortwave radio.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting stopped when a ricocheting bullet killed a gunman who
turned out to be Barron. His fleeing brothers in arms left his body
in the street.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how we knew who they were," Blancornelas said. "It was the
footprint of the Arellanos."</TE>
<TE>   At the hospital, the bishop and several priests blessed him.</TE>
<TE>   "They were afraid I was going to die," Blancornelas said. "They
told me, 'You can't die because you have to do what you're doing,
because that is what God wishes.' "</TE>
<TE>   He feared that if he left town, other Tijuana journalists would be
cowed.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone, even the narcotics traffickers, was waiting to see what
I would do," Blancornelas said.</TE>
<TE>   "If I retired, I was afraid the narcotics traffickers would feel
free to do the same thing to my colleagues," he said. "And they had
killed my companero, Luis Valero. I couldn't give him back his life,
so I had to do something."</TE>
<TE>   Writing History of Cartel</TE>
<TE>   Blancornelas went back to writing the history of the Tijuana drug
cartel in blistering weekly installments, returning to the familiar
hard-boiled style and gallows humor that give his work the flavor of
a murder mystery.</TE>
<TE>   "What else was I supposed to do?" he shrugged. "I wasn't about to
start writing about cooking recipes or social events."</TE>
<TE>   So Mexico City sent the 13 soldiers. The Arellano Felixes sent an
emissary, Blancornelas said, in the form of a prominent Tijuana
lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted me to publish something saying that it was not the
Arellanos who ordered me killed," Blancornelas said. "They said they
would be careful that nothing happened to me again so they wouldn't
be blamed."</TE>
<TE>   What Blancornelas really wanted was a sit-down interview with
Ramon or his brother, Benjamin Arellano Felix.</TE>
<TE>   But he had been offered nothing more than cell phone communication
by the time Ramon was shot by Mazatlan police in February. His
brother Benjamin was captured by soldiers a month later, and a few
days later, gunmen killed the attorney-emissary.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all the violence that brought them down," Blancornelas
said. "Ramon was the killer of the family. When they killed him,
people were relieved. The city became more tranquil."</TE>
<TE>   Zeta's top stories--featured on its Web site,
www.zetatijuana.com--are becoming a more routine mix now, of
government news, politics and cultural affairs. But Blancornelas is
not contemplating removing his bodyguards anytime soon. Like his
readers, he will await further developments.</TE>
<TE>   "The cartel is becoming more Americanized: more organized, more
discreet, less scandalous," Blancornelas said. "Everyone knows about
the Arellanos. Yet if I ask you to name one American narcotics
trafficker, you can't, even though Americans distribute tons of drugs
in Los Angeles."</TE>

<DH>Entertainment: Orange County Fair prizes offbeat vendors.
Competition is stiff.</DH>

<LD>Marc Stamper's life as a sideshow performer began with a newspaper
ad.</LD>
<LD>   "It said 'adventurous couple needed,' " recalls the 29-year-old
resident of Eugene, Ore., who had just left a job in corporate
marketing and was looking for something to do. "When they said it was
pig racing, I laughed for three hours."</LD>
<LD>   Today, Stamper and his 23-year-old fiancee, Holly Standiford,
spend eight months a year touring the West Coast with a trailer full
of pigs. "It's the fastest show on four hoofs and a snout," says
Stamper, whose charges bear such names as Mona Lisow and Hog Hogan.</LD>
<TE>   Jim Harvey was a successful real estate agent in Honolulu when he
hit on the idea for Fantasy Flight Studios, a traveling movie set
that transforms children into stars of their own two-minute video
productions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a reasonable living," says Harvey, 49, who lives in
Westchester when not on the road. "But the real payoff for me is that
I have the school year off [to spend with] my kids."</TE>
<TE>   And John Little, 45, was a struggling commercial fisherman six
years ago when, on a whim, he spent $6,000 for a wax-warming machine.
The result: Wax Hand Jive, a booth that makes wax sculptures of
people's hands.</TE>
<TE>   The three are among hundreds of exhibitors hawking their wares in
Costa Mesa on this final weekend of the Orange County Fair's 17-day
run. What makes them different, fair officials say, is that they are
entrepreneurs offering unusual amusements found only at fairs.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we'd have a fair without folks like that,"
concessions supervisor Keli Villegas said of the people who spend
several months a year traveling the fair circuit. Of the Orange
County event's 300-plus concessions, she said, these "oddball"
exhibitors number 30 to 50. "It's great being able to get a
new-fangled mop," Villegas said.</TE>
<TE>   Competition is fierce among the 400 or so applicants vying for the
10 to 20 spaces that open at the Orange County Fair each year.
Concessionaires pay flat fees ranging from $1,250 to $10,000,
depending on the size and location of their displays.</TE>
<TE>   The winners become part of a community that generally spends three
to seven months a year traveling from fair to fair throughout the
Western United States. While on site, most live in trailers or motor
homes on the fairgrounds. During the off-season, they return to homes
that are often far away.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like being part of an extended family," said Cliff Elder,
76, proprietor of the Televac Personality Handwriting Analysis
machine, which he takes to fairs in Sacramento, Fresno, Bakersfield,
Tulare and sometimes Albuquerque--as well as Costa Mesa. Elder, who
lives in Temecula, has been working the fair circuit since retiring
from the Marine Corps in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like having a whole bunch of brothers and sisters traveling
with you," he said. "They treat you like a person, not a number."</TE>
<TE>   Often that attitude extends to customers, some of whom return year
after year to see their favorite concessionaires. "My son had this
done last year," said Kathy Ashworth of San Clemente, standing in
line at Wax Hand Jive with $6 for a wax likeness of her 6-year-old
daughter's hand.</TE>
<TE>   Proprietor Little gently guides the girl's hand into the warm vat
of liquid wax. Alternating between the wax and a container of ice
water, he dips her hand several times before the material hardens
around it like a glove. Then he slides the stuff off, revealing a wax
replica of the girl's hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I have lots of returning customers," he says, "especially little
kids whose parents do their hands every year to see them grow. I have
an 8-year-old set of twins at the L.A. County Fair who I've been
doing since they were 3."</TE>
<TE>   He pauses to dip the wax hand into another vat of dyed wax. "As
far as I know," Little says, "I'm the only one doing this
anymore--[and] they can only see me at the fair."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From financial matters to disagreements about the kids, Renna and her
companion had been arguing for months.</LD>
<LD>   A family road trip to Louisiana was supposed to help alleviate the
tension, but the relationship was over before the couple even reached
the state line.</LD>
<LD>   Almost a year later, Renna, 37, recounted her odyssey as she sat
in a conference room of the Inglewood apartment complex that she and
10 other women now call home.</LD>
<TE>   On the trip, she recalled, a disagreement grew into an argument.
Before she knew it, she and her three children had been booted from
the family's Dodge and left stranded outside a mini-mart, 80 miles
east of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The Last Straw</TE>
<TE>   For Renna, who had endured months of erratic, abusive and
sometimes violent behavior from the once-caring man, it was the final
straw.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked at my kids' eyes and I realized I couldn't put them
through abuse like this," Renna said. "My kids are all good,
straight-A students, and I wasn't going to let them fall to the
bottom of the pit. I had to be more of a woman."</TE>
<TE>   But she had nowhere to go.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting with Renna as she told her story were two counselors with
the Midnight Mission family housing program.</TE>
<TE>   For them, the story of Renna--who asked that her full name not be
used--is all too familiar. Since 1994, workers at the Inglewood
program have provided counseling, financial planning and free
long-term housing to homeless women, men and children from throughout
Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Most clients turn to them after years of domestic violence. Others
are victims of unfortunate circumstances. Whatever the reason, the
mission helps them get back on their feet. It offers a one-year,
rent-free stay in a private furnished apartment.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, participants agree to make sacrifices and abide by
stringent rules.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, they must obtain jobs within 45 days of entering the
program and put 70% of their incomes into savings accounts set up in
their names. They must attend weekly financial and counseling
sessions. The idea, program directors said, is to end two problematic
cycles: emotional and financial dependency.</TE>
<TE>   There are other non-negotiable matters. Women leaving violent
domestic situations who want to enter the program must obtain
restraining orders against their former spouses or companions.</TE>
<TE>   Curfews are strictly enforced--10 p.m. on weekdays, 11 p.m. on
weekends--and all adults and children older than 15 must sign into
and out of the complex. Televisions and telephones are not allowed in
the apartments--a way to focus the clients on their jobs and their
children.</TE>
<TE>   Women at the house say they don't mind the rules and look forward
to the counseling and empowerment sessions.</TE>
<TE>   "We teach them that it's really important to take care of self,"
said Faye Mandell, a social worker. "If there's a loss in air
pressure on a plane, you put the mask on yourself first. If you don't
have self-esteem, you can't pass that on to your children."</TE>
<TE>   For Ilda Gonzalez, a 33-year-old mother of two who graduated from
the program in 2000, one memorable lesson had to do with "red
lights."</TE>
<TE>   Red lights, Mandell explained, are all the signs that a man might
be trouble. Gonzalez now knows that she ignored several red lights
when she married a jealous, possessive man.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband had another daughter from another relationship who he
didn't take care of," she said. "Why'd I think it was going to be
different with my kids?"</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't. One day in 1999, as she carried her 2-year-old,
Gonzalez's husband swung at her face. He missed and struck the girl
instead. After several months at a shelter for battered women in Long
Beach, Gonzalez wound up at the Midnight Mission.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a dream," she said. "It wasn't going to be forever,
but it was very nice."</TE>
<TE>   For a year, Gonzalez saved most of the modest income she made as a
cashier at two department stores. She left the program with $13,000,
part of which she used for a down payment on her first home.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nothing outrageous, but it's a nice neighborhood," she said
of her modest two-bedroom Inglewood house.</TE>
<TE>   The Inglewood Neighborhood Homeownership Center is working with
several program participants to help them buy homes in the area, said
the family housing co-director, Angelo Aguiar.</TE>
<TE>   Hometown Lure</TE>
<TE>   Program directors said Inglewood was chosen because the area's
reasonable home prices allow these families to stay in the community
where many of their children have attended school.</TE>
<TE>   "Inglewood's really progressive in its efforts to encourage people
to become homeowners," said Carrie Gatlin, director of program

<HD>Marv Goux, 69; USC Football Player, Coach Was 'Mr. Trojan'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marv Goux, the gruff-talking assistant coach who became synonymous
with USC football over a span of three decades, died of cancer
Saturday at a Los Angeles hospital. He was 69.</LD>
<LD>   The man known as "Mr. Trojan" played in two Rose Bowls and helped
guide the team to five national championships before finishing his
career with the Los Angeles Rams.</LD>
<LD>   Working in the shadows of coaches John McKay and John Robinson,
Goux was the grit of the program, often summoned to give fiery
speeches before the annual Notre Dame game. Even when he was
implicated in a scandal--caught scalping tickets and funneling cash
to players--Goux said he was only acting out of loyalty.</LD>
<TE>   To this day, players walking onto the practice field pause to slap
the entrance known as "Goux's Gate."</TE>
<TE>   "Football has always been my place in the sun from the time I
could remember," Goux said in 1994. "I loved playing the game and
knew from the beginning that I wanted to coach.</TE>
<TE>   "No man has enjoyed what he has done more than I."</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Barbara native arrived at the university as an
undersized linebacker in 1952. Years later, when speaking to players
about sacrifice, he could recall a game in which he intercepted a
pass and was hit by three opponents. The resulting back injury left
him with a hunch, "like I was looking for nickels," he joked.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating with a degree in physical education, Goux spent a
season coaching in high school before returning to USC in 1957.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next 26 years, the team went to 11 Rose Bowls, winning
eight. Players such as Gary Jeter, Tim Rossovich and Ron Mix became
All-Americans under his guidance.</TE>
<TE>   They also came to know his scowl, formed from thick eyebrows and a
boxer's nose. His favorite lunch was raw hamburger sprinkled with
chopped onions. "That's what makes me so tough," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Notre Dame game one season, Goux stopped practice and
pointed to a former player standing on the sideline. The man was
missing a front tooth. "He lost it right here on this field while
getting ready for Notre Dame," Goux said. His players growled, then
cheered. The alumnus knew the tooth was gone because of neglect--not
football--but no one contradicted Goux.</TE>
<TE>   "Marv was definitely the anchor of the team," former tailback
Anthony Davis said. "You had to respect him."</TE>
<TE>   It was near the end of his USC career, in 1982, when the NCAA
discovered his practice of selling complimentary tickets and placed
the team on three years' probation. "I brought the penalties on
myself," Goux said, "but ... I did it to help my players."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson became coach of the Rams soon after, and Goux followed.
He remained on the Rams' staff until 1990, then spent four years as
an administrator.</TE>
<TE>   Frequently invited back to USC, Goux spoke at McKay's memorial
service last fall and, in typical fashion, had the auditorium
alternately cheering and laughing.</TE>
<TE>   The longtime assistant reminisced about famous games and nights
spent at Julie's, a restaurant near campus. He recalled the time he
and McKay drove to Central California to visit a recruit. They were
met by a growling German shepherd and had to dash inside the house.</TE>
<TE>   As they drove away, McKay told him: "If this guy isn't a good
football player, I'm going to fire you."</TE>
<TE>   Later, a videotape showed McKay praising his assistants: "Those
were the guys who coached the team."</TE>
<TE>   Goux is survived by his wife, Patti of Palm Desert; his daughter,
Linda Kanen, and son-in-law, Douglas Kanen, of Newport Beach; a
brother, James of Carpinteria; and four grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service at USC will be announced later. In lieu of
flowers, the family requests that donations be made to the USC/Norris
Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital or the university's athletic
department.</TE>

<HD>Caltrans Tenants Complain of Neglected Homes, Rent Hikes</HD>
<DH>Bureaucracy: Agency has managed 585 houses on stalled
freeway route for decades. It admits maintenance problems but defends
increases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 100 tenants of Caltrans-owned houses criticized the agency
Saturday for raising rents and accused it of neglecting to maintain
their houses, some of them historic, along the route of the
decades-delayed Long Beach Freeway extension.</LD>
<LD>   It was the latest chapter in a protracted dispute between Caltrans
and tenants of the 585 homes along the corridor in Pasadena, South
Pasadena and the El Sereno neighborhood of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the homes have been in the agency's possession since the
1950s, when Caltrans bought the houses when freeway construction
seemed imminent. South Pasadena has long opposed the freeway, arguing
it would bisect and destroy the community. The city has fought the
issue in court while government funding has dwindled.</LD>
<TE>   At a meeting at El Sereno Senior Center, neighbors complained
about fungus on their walls and ceilings, cockroach and rat
infestations, uninsulated houses and steep rent increases that could
take effect as early as Thursday. They showed pictures of corroded
pipes, overgrown trees and serious water damage.</TE>
<TE>   "This very diverse neighborhood has a commonality," said one
Pasadena resident, Lyn Miller, "and now it has a rallying point: a
slumlord named Caltrans."</TE>
<TE>   Miller, who is living in one Caltrans house while waiting for
another, the one she originally rented 10 years ago, to be renovated,
said that the agency is forcing rent increases on its tenants of as
much as 23%.</TE>
<TE>   A Caltrans spokeswoman, Deborah Harris, said the rent increases,
which she described as a 10% increase last August and another 10%
this year, are part of the agency's efforts to bring the rental
prices on all of its properties statewide up to fair market value.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a responsibility to all taxpayers to manage the
properties to the best of our ability," she said, "and to get a
return on taxpayers' money."</TE>
<TE>   Harris conceded that it appears "there is an ongoing problem" with
maintenance of the properties. Residents have been complaining since
the 1980s about issues similar to the ones raised Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   A 1973 federal court mandate ordered the state to make its "best
efforts" to maintain the properties and rent them out to "prevent
vacant structures from becoming public health and safety hazards."</TE>
<TE>   Of particular concern in recent years have been 92 historic homes
in Pasadena in the freeway corridor. The agency had allowed the
Victorian, Craftsman and Spanish revival structures to fall into
disrepair. It began to renovate the homes in 1995, but a state audit
in 2000 showed that the agency had spent its entire
allocation--nearly $20 million--to rehabilitate only 39 of the
houses.</TE>
<TE>   While the state did not offer numbers on how many of the houses
are vacant, residents estimated that there are 40 uninhabited homes
in Pasadena alone.</TE>
<TE>   "Caltrans does not belong in the landlord business," said Suzanne
Reed, chief of staff for Assemblywoman Carol Liu (D-La Canada
Flintridge), who has been working on behalf of the tenants.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Stevens, Caltrans' regional director of property services,
was occasionally heckled as he tried to present the agency's side of
the dispute. He said he had been on the job for just a few months and
asked tenants not to dwell on the past. "Give us a chance," he
pleaded, "and see if we can win your trust."</TE>
<TE>   Stevens said that the agency had fielded 3,500 service requests
and spent $2.7 million on maintenance and repairs for its 710
properties in the last year. Because the state budget has not yet
passed, he said, he currently can make only the repairs that are
matters of health and safety.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the tenants expressed concern that comparable rental
prices Caltrans had used to set their rent increases were for houses
that did not exist or were owner-occupied. They said that the state
had a responsibility to provide affordable housing, and pointed out
that the article of the state Constitution cited by Michael
Rodrigues, Caltrans' senior right-of-way agent, to justify the move
toward fair market value pertains to motor vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Others worried that their speaking up about the conditions in
their homes and the rent increases might bring retribution from the
agency.</TE>
<TE>   Marie Salas, who is organizing the El Sereno tenants, said she had
been served an eviction notice after refusing to allow an inspector,
who did not identify himself, to enter her home. "Why are they
harassing my family?" she asked. "Am I being targeted? They know I am
an activist toward this immoral and unjust rent increase. I feel that
I am being targeted to keep me quiet, shut me down."</TE>
<TE>   Harris of Caltrans denied that charge. "We are trying to be as
fair and equitable as possible," she said. If some residents "feel
they are not being treated properly, we would like to know about
that."</TE>
<TE>   Stevens said that Caltrans plans to create a committee to help
evaluate how the agency determines free-market rents. The panel is to
include a representative from each of the communities in the freeway
corridor.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for some of the elected officials from those communities
suggested that Caltrans place a moratorium on rent increases until
that committee can be formed.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, who said that she holds a memo of understanding with
Caltrans that it would not raise the rent on the house she occupies
until her original house has been renovated, said she had been told
recently that the agency would not rehabilitate the first house and
was instead raising her rent.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a David-and-Goliath battle we are being forced to fight,"
she said. "We will sling every stone we have until we are
victorious."</TE>

<HD>Boy Safe After Fleeing Man Is Captured</HD>
<DH>Safety: Neighbors help hold suspect who allegedly grabbed
child in 5-year-old's backyard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A screaming mother managed to swoop her 5-year-old son away from a
bare-chested man who had scaled their backyard fence in Lomita and
allegedly grabbed hold of the boy, while her husband and neighbors
gave chase and pinned the intruder to the ground.</LD>
<LD>   The events lasted only minutes, Suzanne and David Arnado said
Saturday, but it will give them chills for a lifetime.</LD>
<LD>   "My child was playing in his own backyard. We have a locked gate.
My husband and I were watching him and something like this can
happen," said Suzanne, 32, breaking into tears as she recounted the
episode. "What is this world coming to?"</LD>
<TE>   The couple said they may never know what Randall Turner, 51,
intended to do after allegedly taking Vincent by the arm Friday
evening. Turner was being held Saturday on suspicion of false
imprisonment, a felony.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Janice Munson said detectives
were still investigating Turner's intentions. The initial inquiry
supports the neighbors' account of what happened, she said. Munson
praised their quick response.</TE>
<TE>   "For that many residents to get involved, it's great, just
fabulous," she said. Munson described Turner as a local resident.
Authorities will present charges of false imprisonment and annoying
or molesting a child to prosecutors for review, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The family had just returned to their Oak Street neighborhood home
from their son's T-ball game and were deciding what to make for
dinner when Vincent asked to go out back to play.</TE>
<TE>   Theirs is a backyard equipped for a boy: a big swing set, balls,
trucks and a beagle puppy named Snoopy to play with. The wood gate is
not only 8 feet tall, it's padlocked.</TE>
<TE>   The couple decided on spaghetti, and Suzanne was headed to the
market to buy some ground turkey. That's when they say they heard the
wrought-iron security door leading to the patio slam shut.</TE>
<TE>   "We look over, and there is a man standing in the back, long hair
in a ponytail, no shirt, just shorts," David Arnado, 35, said. "He
has one hand holding the door shut and my son's arm in the other
hand."</TE>
<TE>   Who is this guy? What's he doing in my backyard? Do I know him?
All these questions came to mind in "half a second," David said.</TE>
<TE>   Suzanne belted out what her next-door neighbor described as "a
blood-curdling scream," crying, "Call 911! Call 911! A man has my
boy!"</TE>
<TE>   David, pumped with adrenaline, threw himself against the heavy
door with enough thrust to jar it open and throw the intruder off
balance, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The man let go of Vincent in the stumble. Suzanne grabbed her boy
in her arms and ran inside the house, still screaming for help.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Mary Ellen Walsh dialed 911. But she wasn't sure what to
report. "You need to come fast. My neighbor is screaming something
about her son," Walsh said she told the operator.</TE>
<TE>   David, alone with the man, threw a lawn chair at him, shouting,
"Get out! Get out!"</TE>
<TE>   More neighbors heard the shouts--not a typical argument, thought
Martin Cordelo, who lives in an apartment behind the Arnados.</TE>
<TE>   Moments earlier, Cordelo had pulled into his carport and saw a man
"with a crazed look in his eyes" climb a nearby telephone pole. "I
put two and two together," he said, got back in the car and drove
around the corner to help his neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   As the intruder tried to jump another fence to escape, David
pushed him over the top. "I just wanted to get him out of my
backyard," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The father continued the chase, joined now by two other men. At
his next-door neighbor's house David caught Turner and slammed him
into a wall. The father and several others held Turner down until
deputies arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies transported Turner to a local hospital to treat his minor
injuries, a spokesman said. He was being held at the sheriff's Lomita
station in lieu of $25,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, frightened by the kidnapping and death of Samantha
Runnion in Stanton, Suzanne had gone over all the rules with her son.
Never did she think she would be moved to enforce a new one:</TE>
<TE>   "Never again will he be allowed to play alone in his own
backyard."</TE>

<HD>LAX Paralyzed by Security Breach</HD>
<DH>Airport: After a man bypasses a checkpoint, nearly 150
flights are delayed. He is not found.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousands of airline passengers were evacuated Saturday from five Los
Angeles International Airport terminals and hundreds of flights were
delayed while police searched for an unidentified man who breached a
security checkpoint.</LD>
<LD>   The incident snarled air and ground traffic at LAX after officials
temporarily shut down the airport's upper level and the Federal
Aviation Administration halted all incoming flights from Western
states, an airport spokeswoman said.</LD>
<LD>   Complete details of the incident were not available, but officials
said the evacuation was ordered at 12:50 p.m. after a ticketed male
passenger somehow bypassed a security checkpoint in Terminal 5 and
then disappeared.</LD>
<TE>   "Since Terminal 5 is connected to several other terminals, several
other terminals were evacuated," said Nico Melendez, a spokesman for
the federal Transportation Security Administration.</TE>
<TE>   The shutdown delayed nearly 150 flights and caused the
cancellation of 10 others, leaving as many as 8,000 passengers
stranded on the airport's outside upper deck while security sweeps of
Terminals 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 were conducted, said LAX spokeswoman Nancy
Castles. The FAA also called a "ground halt" of all flights
originating in the Western states and bound for LAX. The man had not
been found by late Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   All terminals were reopened by 3 p.m., and passengers were
rescreened.</TE>
<TE>   Designed in the 1950s, the terminals are connected by a series of
passageways that passengers with connecting flights can use to move
between terminals. Once there was a security breach, Castles said,
all of the terminals had to be cleared.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't know how far or how fast someone can get from terminal
to terminal [through the passageways]," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of airline passengers milled around on the airport's
upper deck while the search was conducted. No traffic was allowed to
pass outside the closed terminals.</TE>
<TE>   Many passengers seemed resigned to the delay.</TE>
<TE>   Kazumasa Yoshikane, 34, said he was headed to Aguas Calientes,
Mexico, after arriving on a flight from Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been delayed by two hours already, but I think we're going
to board in a few minutes," he said in midafternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Lewis, 33, said his flight to Pittsburgh had already boarded
when he and the other passengers were asked to deplane.</TE>
<TE>   He was still waiting to reboard 3 1/2 hours later but sounded
philosophical about the wait.</TE>
<TE>   "It's par for the course in the times we're living in," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act signed by
President Bush last year, all airport security checkpoints will be
staffed with federalized screeners by Nov. 19.</TE>
<TE>   The Transportation Security Administration was created to make
airports more secure in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in
New York and near Washington, D.C. The agency currently holds the
contracts for private security screening companies at airports around
the country.</TE>

<HD>Local Bands Enlist in Battle to Shore Up Ebbing Beach
Access in Malibu</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The cards and letters in support of Sand Aid, the concert to free the
beaches of Malibu, keep rolling in, and today I'd like to bring
everyone up to date on the latest developments.</LD>
<LD>   As you may recall, the concert will be a fund-raiser for the legal
defense of Access for All, which has been sued by beach-dwelling
mogul David Geffen. Geffen promised to allow public beach access in
return for the right to enlarge his compound, but then Mr. Bigshot
changed his mind and sued to keep the gate closed.</LD>
<LD>   Readers have generously offered money and an array of services, up
to and including the production and promotion of the concert. I'm
sorry to report that U2, Jackson Browne and Sting--self-proclaimed
consciousness-raising performers--have bailed out on us because of
alleged scheduling conflicts, and no response yet from Joni Mitchell
or Sheryl Crow.</LD>
<TE>   But who needs them?</TE>
<TE>   Four Southern California bands--Minimal Effort, No Jack City, Come
And Go and Pseudopod--have offered their services. I'm thinking of
headlining Pseudopod because it's on the Interscope Records label,
which is part of the Geffen/A&amp;M music family. The idea of a
Geffen-affiliated band muckraking for Mr. Mogul to open the gates is
too tempting to resist.</TE>
<TE>   I did receive a kind offer to merge Sand Aid with the
Force-for-Freedom concert scheduled for Aug. 10 and 11 in Malibu,
featuring the Neville Brothers, John Tesh, chanting Tibetan monks and
a host of others. I'm fine with the Neville Brothers and chanting
monks, but we do have standards, and so I notified the
Force-for-Freedom producer that if they don't drop John Tesh, we have
no deal.</TE>
<TE>   Still waiting to hear back.</TE>
<TE>   Sand Aid--the date of which will be announced in this space--also
will feature the folk duet Doodoo Wah, which has offered to come all
the way down from Gold Rush country to sing, "This sand is your sand,
this sand is my sand ...."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of parodies, readers have knocked themselves out
rewriting the words to Joni Mitchell's "Big Yellow Taxi," whose
famous chorus goes:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Don't it always seem to go,</TE>
<TE>   That you don't know what</TE>
<TE>   you've got</TE>
<TE>   'Til it's gone.</TE>
<TE>   They paved paradise.</TE>
<TE>   They put up a parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   My favorite effort so far, abridged below, is from Jack Grimshaw
of Long Beach:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ain't it always in the news,</TE>
<TE>   The rich getting more</TE>
<TE>   While we get the blues?</TE>
<TE>   They put up a mansion</TE>
<TE>   And fenced off a public</TE>
<TE>   beach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In fairness, let me say that not all readers are with us, and some
took issue with my contention that all beaches in California are
owned by the public. So allow me to clarify.</TE>
<TE>   It is true that some beach dwellers own a private patch of sand.
But generally speaking, the public owns everything seaward of wet
sand, and homeowners have attempted to manipulate legal
interpretation of that line of demarcation.</TE>
<TE>   In Geffen's case, as with other movers and shakers, he promised to
allow public access to a big chunk of the beach in return for permits
to build his dream house. Steve Hoye of Access for All says there's a
275-foot-long, 100-foot-</TE>
<TE>   deep beach out there that people can't enjoy.</TE>
<TE>   Why? Because Geffen, refusing to live up to the deal he agreed to,
won't open the gate to the walkway that runs from Pacific Coast
Highway to the beach.</TE>
<TE>   For shame, for shame.</TE>
<TE>   Hoye says another nasty access battle is simmering just up the
coast, at Malibu's Broad Beach. Homeowners have hired red-shirted
rent-a-cops to patrol the sand on all-terrain vehicles, rousting
people off beaches and herding them like seagulls into vertical
columns.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll tell you this is a private beach and you have to sit in
the vertical access way, and if a leg or surfboard is sticking over
the line, they'll push it back. It happens all the time," says Hoye.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners also are hiring surveyors and manipulating property
lines at the water's edge, posting "keep out" signs, according to
Hoye.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't like arriving at the beach and getting hassled by
little private police forces. It's appalling. And I don't want people
with martinis coming out and saying, 'Get off my property,' when it's
not their property."</TE>
<TE>   (All of you who asked how to donate to Access for All or how to
get more information about it can contact Hoye at sierrasteve</TE>
<TE>   @earthlink.net, or write him at P.O. Box 1704, Topanga, CA 90290).</TE>
<TE>   Malibu homeowners often tell me, in arguing against public access,
that people can't be trusted not to foul the beach. And yes, there
are a few idiots in every crowd.</TE>
<TE>   But Encino surfer Noel Anenberg notes that Malibu has no sewer
system, despite being home to a bunch of self-congratulatory
progressives.</TE>
<TE>   What that means, Anenberg says, is that moguls and movie stars use
septic tanks, the contents of which occasionally are washed to sea.</TE>
<TE>   "Bacterial infections of the respiratory and gastrointestinal
systems plague Malibu surfers and swimmers. Yet those liberal
champions of our environment refuse to clean up theirs!" rails
Anenberg. "Isn't it bad enough we have to listen to their crap?"</TE>
<TE>   Sand Aid 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Catch the wave.</TE>

<HD>Walter McCrone, 86; Expert on Light Microscope</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Think small" was Walter C. McCrone's sly motto.</LD>
<LD>   Sly, because he was a giant in a very small world.</LD>
<LD>   His world was chemical microscopy, which uses microscopical
methods to solve problems, such as determining the age of an artwork
or whether a stain is red paint or something more sinister.</LD>
<TE>   He found that the legendary Shroud of Turin could never have
draped the body of Jesus, a bold assertion he made in 1980 that was
backed up some years later by more sophisticated carbon-dating tests.</TE>
<TE>   He examined the Vinland Map, a famous document thought to have
originated in the Viking era, and declared it a modern forgery.</TE>
<TE>   He even analyzed bits of Beethoven's hair and confirmed that the
brilliant composer had abnormally high levels of lead in his body, a
condition that could explain his mental instability and death.</TE>
<TE>   McCrone was Sherlock Holmes with a microscope, whose extraordinary
ability to recognize the chemical structure of thousands of
substances on sight left other scientists in awe.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't be interested in microscopy and not have heard of
Walter McCrone," said Skip Palenik, a McCrone protege who runs
Microtrace Co. in Elgin, Ill. "He was literally the master of the
instrument."</TE>
<TE>   McCrone was 86 when he died July 10 at his home in Chicago. The
cause was congestive heart failure.</TE>
<TE>   An avid teacher who mentored many of the country's leading art
conservation specialists, industrial chemists and forensic
scientists, he is remembered for his passionate advocacy of the light
microscope as a problem-solving tool.</TE>
<TE>   That instrument is essentially a microscope with a light bulb, and
is often disdained in analytical chemistry as a poor cousin to the
electron microscope and other high-tech magnifiers. McCrone traveled
the world to demonstrate the power of the humble device he favored.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a real proselytizer," said Michael Schilling, senior
scientist at the Getty Conservation Institute, who called McCrone the
father of modern light microscopy.</TE>
<TE>   "He always stressed in his classes that in most cases you could
answer the question with just the light microscope," Schilling said.
"I can think of few scientists who can make the same claim."</TE>
<TE>   The microscope expert was founder of McCrone Associates, a private
laboratory in Chicago staffed by scientists solving mysteries largely
by microscopical analysis.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Wilmington, Del., McCrone had intended to become a
civil engineer like his father, who headed one of the first DuPont
plants to produce cellophane. That goal was set aside when McCrone
failed his engineering courses at Cornell.</TE>
<TE>   He fared better in chemistry, however, and became a convert when
he enrolled in one of the last classes taught by pioneering
microscopist Emile Chamot. McCrone earned his bachelor's degree in
chemistry in 1938 and his PhD in 1942, then taught for several years
at what is now the Illinois Institute of Technology.</TE>
<TE>   In 1956 he borrowed enough money to buy a $400 microscope and
launched his own business.</TE>
<TE>   He first gained widespread attention for his role in investigating
the 1955 murder of an 8-year-old Canton, Ill., girl. A cabdriver had
been convicted and sentenced to death for the killing. But when the
case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, McCrone was hired to
examine a pair of the accused man's undershorts, which the
prosecution maintained were stained with his blood. McCrone proved
that the stains were red paint, and the cabdriver was freed.</TE>
<TE>   As his reputation grew, McCrone was frequently asked to examine
artworks. He authenticated rare paintings such as Da Vinci's
long-lost "Christ Among the Doctors."</TE>
<TE>   But the man who lectured widely on "What Every Good Forger Should
Know" was perhaps best known as a debunker of myths.</TE>
<TE>   In 1973 he was hired to examine the Vinland Map, which purportedly
dated to AD 1440. Yale University, which had acquired the supposed
relic in the 1960s for $1 million, enlisted McCrone to verify that it
held proof of the Vikings' exploration of the New World 50 years
before Columbus.</TE>
<TE>   McCrone devised a special needle to dislodge tiny particles of ink
from the map while avoiding visible damage. He found that the
particles contained anatase, a type of titanium that was rarely found
in nature--and unavailable commercially until the 1920s. These
results led him to declare that the map was a fake.</TE>
<TE>   Scholarly debate over the map's authenticity has ebbed and flowed
over 30 years, but to McCrone the case was closed. He compared the
probability of finding anatase in medieval ink to the likelihood
"that Nelson's flagship at Trafalgar was a hovercraft."</TE>
<TE>   In 1978 McCrone was asked to join a team of American scientists
attempting to authenticate the Shroud of Turin, a 14-foot length of
linen bearing the imprint of a body thought to be that of Jesus after
the Crucifixion.</TE>
<TE>   McCrone's analysis indicated the presence of red ochre and
vermilion, paints commonly used in the 14th century. But, to the
dismay of some believers, he found no traces of blood. He concluded
that the cloth was nothing more than "a beautiful painting by an
inspired medieval artist."</TE>
<TE>   McCrone's position on the cloth attracted many critics--and death
threats--but he never wavered in his certainty that it was not a
burial shroud for Jesus in biblical times.</TE>
<TE>   He found validation in 1988 when a group of American, British and
Swiss scientists completed carbon-dating tests placing the linen's
origins in the 1300s.</TE>
<TE>   McCrone spent most of his waking hours peering down a microscope.
He worked seven days a week, undeterred by holidays. He routinely
walked the mile to his lab--at 3:30 every morning, rain or
shine--beginning with a brisk run down 21 flights of stairs in his
Chicago apartment building. In the evenings, he would run back up,
often challenging visitors to take the elevator while he charged
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   In the lab and the classroom, he could be just as playful.</TE>
<TE>   If a student failed to set up a microscope properly, that student
would find his microscope disassembled the next morning.</TE>
<TE>   McCrone also relished a game he called UFO. It involved a smidgen
of an unidentified substance being placed on a slide under a
microscope. The player was only permitted to ask what kind of
solution it was mounted in. The substance could be anything from
tarantula feces to the residue from the bottom of a bag of
pistachios. It was next to impossible to stump McCrone, who said he
could identify the structures of 30,000 substances on sight.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true that McCrone sort of bragged about being able to
identify thousands of different things under a microscope. But he
could do it. Many people looked upon him in awe," said Wilkan Fong,
former chairman of criminalistics for the American Academy of
Forensic Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the world never sees what I see," McCrone once told the
Chicago Tribune. "It is more beautiful than anything.... "</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 45 years, Lucy. They had no
children.</TE>

<HD>Who Could Resist Rooster With Sidney Moo Cow on His Back?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't exactly the Rose Parade, not with the rooster prancing
about or the goat wearing a straw hat. But it was a competition, and
they needed judges and, well, I don't have an exciting social life,
so ...</LD>
<LD>   So I sat there last week in the livestock arena at the Orange
County Fair, one of five judges for the annual Barnyard Fashion
Parade. If that sounds like easy duty, you try determining under
deadline which is more creative--a Holstein wearing a beret or a goat
in a wraparound skirt.</LD>
<LD>   The other four judges seemed equally aware of the pressure. "Are
there actually categories to be judged?" asked Jeremy Simmons, a
physical therapist at St. Jude Medical Center. Little did he know
there were five categories: Most Creative, Most Original, Funniest,
Best Dressed and Best Theme, and that we would name first- and
second-place winners. Most of us weren't sure how those categories
differed, but we did the best we could.</LD>
<TE>   The fashion parade was the brainstorm 40 years ago of Kathleen
Huff, now 86 and the persuasive woman who talked me into judging.</TE>
<TE>   "We like to get someone from The Times or The Register," she had
said on the phone earlier in the week. "The last time your paper sent
someone, though, he yapped and yapped the whole time about it."</TE>
<TE>   I could have told her we have a lot of immature people around here
who also wouldn't know a barrow from a gilt if you turned them both
upside down.</TE>
<TE>   No problem with an old Nebraska boy like me, however, and I was
rarin' to go. I got there about 30 minutes early and realized that
most of the contestants would be goats. That explained why Huff's
daughter, Martha, sounded so happy when, just before the competition,
she shouted, "We've got a rooster, Mom!"</TE>
<TE>   Indeed they did, but I made a mental note not to give the rooster
an edge just for being the only fowl in the show. Turns out, however,
the old boy put on quite a show as he romped into the pen with a toy
animal on his back.</TE>
<TE>   "What the heck is that?" I asked Debbie Rose, a kinesiologist and
the judge seated next to me.</TE>
<TE>   "A chicken," she replied.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's a chicken. I mean the thing on its back."</TE>
<TE>   We learned that was Sidney the Moo Cow, and that was enough in my
book to give first place in the Funniest category to the rooster. My
colleagues, however, lobbied that he place first in the Most Original
category.</TE>
<TE>   With the clock ticking, I caved faster than a French
figure-skating judge.</TE>
<TE>   Happily, however, we judges saw things with remarkable similarity.
Yes, we came from different walks of life, but apparently unified by
knowing how ill-equipped we were to judge, we bonded. My only
complaint is that when the handler for one of the goats approached
the judges' table with an offer of jelly beans, no fewer than three
of them accepted a handful of beans.</TE>
<TE>   Mind you, this was before the judging had begun. The goat later
was rewarded with a first-place ribbon.</TE>
<TE>   Let me just say that isn't how we do business here at the
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   I later had a small ethical problem in giving an award to a
Holstein, not because she was wearing an attractive neckband but
because she had produced 21,000 pounds of milk. In the interest of
unity, I signed off on it. The cow didn't help herself by relieving
herself in front of the judges' table for what seemed like an
inordinately long time. "I was going to give her 'Best Dressed' until
that," Rose said.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, we gave the Overall Sweepstakes award to 9-year-old
Ambur Lattin of Cherry Valley, and not just because she spells her
name funny. She dressed her goat Billy Bob in a nice shirt and denim
jeans (just what Ambur was wearing), then tied a fish to a fishing
pole sticking up from Billy Bob's hindquarters.</TE>
<TE>   That kind of imagination turned the judges' heads.</TE>
<TE>   In the true spirit of the fair, no angry parents or animals rushed
the judge's table afterward, although the rooster seemed irritated
about something.</TE>
<TE>   After collecting myself and finally exhaling when it was over,
something Kathleen Huff had said earlier in the week stuck in my
mind: "I've been told by Times people who have helped out over the
years that it was the hardest work they've ever done."</TE>

<HD>Site Acquired for Simi Retail/Housing Complex</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Escrow closes on the 35 acres near the Civic
Center, where developers plan to build a mall, apartments for senior
citizens and townhomes.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Plans to build a retail and housing complex on Tapo Canyon Road east
of the Simi Valley Civic Center advanced last week when escrow closed
on the sale of a 35-acre site to a Westlake Village firm.</LD>
<LD>   When complete, El Paseo Simi will contain up to 190 townhomes, 176
apartments for senior citizens and a 201,111-square-foot shopping
center featuring a Kohl's department store, a Pavilions grocery and a
Borders bookstore.</LD>
<LD>   Selleck Properties spent $13.75 million to acquire the former
school district site on Tapo Canyon north of Alamo Street, across the
street from City Hall, the library and senior center.</LD>
<TE>   "For right now, it will function as a good downtown," said Tony
Stewart, a senior planner for the city. "This is definitely a nice
in-fill site in the center of the community. We need more multifamily
[housing], so this will go a long way to meeting that need."</TE>
<TE>   Originally donated to the Simi Valley Unified School District for
use as a high school, the site was considered too small. It was
classified as surplus property and placed on the market more than a
dozen years ago.</TE>
<TE>   After several unsuccessful attempts to sell the property, the
district made a deal two years ago with Selleck Properties, which had
built Civic Center Plaza--one of the city's newest retail centers--on
the southwest corner of Tapo Canyon and Alamo. That center contains a
Regal Cinemas, a T.G.I. Friday's and a Men's Wearhouse and has since
been sold to CNA Enterprises, a Century City-based real estate
investment firm.</TE>
<TE>   Proceeds from the sale of the school district property will help
repay long-term debt incurred six years ago when Royal High School's
new stadium and running track were constructed, and will go toward
$1.3 million in improvements planned for Simi Valley High School's
stadium, according to Lowell Schultze, the district's assistant
superintendent of business services. Some of the money probably will
be used to improve other school sites, although final allocations
will be determined by the school board, Schultze said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a very long, detailed and arduous project," said Robert
D. Selleck, president of the development company. "We've had eight or
nine separate meetings with residents of the neighborhood to make
sure they were comfortable with the direction we were going. We've
been working on this since the summer of 2000, and actually talking
to the school district even before that." Grading on the property is
expected to begin next month.</TE>
<TE>   Selleck's company worked with the city to secure environmental and
regulatory approval for the overall project and will oversee
development of the retail portion of El Paseo Simi.</TE>
<TE>   Shea Homes, with its Southern California division in Brea, has
signed on to build the townhomes, and Roseville-based USA Properties
Fund is building the senior apartments, at least 25% of which will be
classified as affordable, according to the development agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an outstanding location for this kind of project," said
Steven Gall, executive vice president of USA Properties. "The city
has been extremely supportive, and [officials] have definitely
created the vision for what they want to see there."</TE>
<TE>   Vintage Paseo Senior Apartments will have one- and two-bedroom
units from 575 to 800 square feet. Gall said rents will range from
about $500 to $900.</TE>
<TE>   To help keep rents low, the city is working with USA Properties as
it applies for a $17-million state revenue bond which, if approved,
would provide it with long-term financing of less than 6%. The bonds,
which support affordable multifamily housing, would be repaid from
future rent receipts.</TE>
<TE>   Gall said his company hopes to secure its final city permits this
fall and begin construction next spring. USA Properties will soon
open 160 senior apartments it is building in Canoga Park near Vanowen
Street and Owensmouth Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Shea Homes is already familiar with Simi Valley, having built in
the Briarwood subdivision, where prices start in the mid-$300,000
range, and is starting work on more than 700 single-family homes at
Big Sky Ranch near Lost Canyons Golf Course, where homes are expected
to be priced from $350,000 to more than $600,000.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Seemann, a Shea regional vice president, said the townhome
project at El Paseo Simi will have two- and three-bedroom
condominiums with two-car garages in three floor plans starting at
about $245,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives us a chance to provide some entry-level housing in Simi
Valley, which desperately needs it," Seemann said.</TE>

<LD>A San Jose radio personality has been suspended after joking about
the kidnapping of a 7-year-old Philadelphia girl.</LD>
<LD>   The girl escaped her kidnappers by chewing through duct tape.</LD>
<LD>   After a sidekick read the news item Wednesday about the girl,
shock jock "Mikey" Esparza of KSJO-FM said, "That's why I don't use
duct tape. That's why I use nylon rope."</LD>
<TE>   Esparza continued after a commercial break, suggesting that
kidnappers buy tarps and use lye to dispose of murder victims. On
Thursday, the station suspended Esparza for a week and broadcast a
formal apology to listeners.</TE>

<LD>The U.S. Forest Service estimated that a forest fire had burned
64,500 acres and was 30% contained by Saturday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Fire crews continued to hold a fire line on the west flank of the
fire, closest to sequoia groves, and helicopters were dropping water
in rugged terrain on the fire's north front, which was moving slowly
toward the Golden Trout Wilderness Area.</LD>
<LD>   Crews also were digging fire lines to the southeast, near Cherry
Hill Road and Mosquito Meadows, and east of Sherman Path. Saturday's
weather conditions for firefighting were improved, with cooler
temperatures and some humidity, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   About $9.1 million had been spent fighting the fire so far.</TE>

<LD>Police continued their search Saturday for a 14-year-old girl
possibly abducted from her home early Friday by a 19-year-old
neighbor.</LD>
<LD>   Siskiyou County Sheriff's officials said they were treating the
case like a kidnapping, although they were unsure whether Sandra
Lourdez Luna had left voluntarily or had been abducted. Deputies said
they had received a call at 2:25 a.m. Friday reporting that Hector
Rivera, the girl's ex-boyfriend, had taken her from her house.</LD>
<LD>   Family members told deputies that the two had had an argument, and
that Rivera had become possessive of Sandra in recent weeks. Officers
said Saturday they had neither found the pair nor seen the car, a
white 1986 Ford Thunderbird with Oregon license plates.</LD>
<TE>   Macdoel is near the Oregon border on California Highway 97, about

<HD>Secession Worries Tenants, Owners</HD>
<DH>Politics: Renters fear that Los Angeles rent control laws
won't survive in Valley or Hollywood cities. Advocates of split try
to ease their fears.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The November vote on San Fernando Valley and Hollywood secession
could toss rent control and other Los Angeles housing laws up for
grabs, causing anxieties among tenants and landlords alike.</LD>
<LD>   Tenants fear the real estate connections of several Valley
secession leaders portend a quick death for rent control if the
region breaks off from the city. But apartment owners citywide have
their own worries: Some believe secession would increase the
political clout of renters in the remainder of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   In a bid to assure voters that secession would not bring rising
rents and evictions, backers of a municipal breakup are asking every
council and mayoral candidate on the secession ballot to sign a
pledge to adopt rent controls in a Valley or Hollywood city.</LD>
<TE>   "We are working to put people at ease," said Jeff Brain, president
of Valley VOTE. "The Valley city will support the continuation of the
existing rent control."</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood pledge goes a step further, asking candidates to
agree to extend rent control to more tenants, said Gene La Pietra,
who heads Hollywood VOTE. Such an expansion, however, might not be
allowable under state law.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, the state attorney general's office has said that the
promises could not be legally enforced. Secession opponents say that
opinion underscores the threat that a breakup poses to hard-won
protections for tenants.</TE>
<TE>   "Secession could very well mean the end to rent control [for]
Valley tenants and Hollywood tenants," said Larry Gross, a longtime
tenant activist and executive director of the Coalition for Economic
Survival.</TE>
<TE>   Six in 10 Los Angeles residents are tenants--the nation's
second-highest percentage after New York City--so rent control and
other housing issues could be key factors at the polls. The secession
movements come at a time when rents have reached historic highs and
affordable housing is in short supply.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is one of a small number of cities that still have
some form of rent control. There are 480,151 registered units under
rent control in the city. About 25% of those (or 118,588) are in the
Valley, and 6% (32,797) are in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The law limits rent increases on most units built before October
1978. It also protects tenants from arbitrary evictions.</TE>
<TE>   The secession measures require a Valley or Hollywood city to adopt
Los Angeles ordinances for 120 days. After that transition, elected
officials of the new cities would be free to change the laws.</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, where an estimated 72% of residents are tenants, La
Pietra said that council candidates cannot ignore renters. "Anyone
that is not committed to this program and this pledge, I can
guarantee you will not be elected,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   A little more than half of the voters in Hollywood are registered
at apartment addresses, compared with a quarter in the proposed
Valley city and nearly 27% citywide, according to the Greensburgh
Group, a Costa Mesa-based firm that maintains statewide voter
registration figures.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra, who said he is a long-time supporter of rent control,
wants to strengthen the law so that it also would cover 25% of new
apartment developments.</TE>
<TE>   Under the current law, most rent increases are capped at 3% a
year. When a tenant moves, the rent can be raised as much as the
landlord wants, but the unit falls under rent control again, once it
is leased. Under La Pietra's plan, a unit would have to be vacated
three times before the rent could be raised without controls. La
Pietra said that would prevent landlords from using loopholes in the
law to evict tenants and raise rents.</TE>
<TE>   But La Pietra's proposal conflicts with the state's 1996
Costa-Hawkins law, which ended stricter rent controls. The law also
restricted any expansion of rent control to new units or to those
that were already exempt when the law was passed, said Christine
Minnehan, legislative advocate for the Western Center on Law and
Poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, tenant advocates have questioned the Valley
secessionists' claims of support for rent control because of the
movement's strong support from landlords and other real estate
interests.</TE>
<TE>   Brain is a real estate broker. Valley VOTE's chairman, Richard
Close, is a real estate attorney who fought in the 1970s against rent
control as a member of a group called Coalition for Housing.</TE>
<TE>   While in the state Legislature, Richard Katz, who heads the Valley
secession campaign, voted so often against bills related to rent
control and other tenant protections that a coalition of 30 renters
groups gave him an F on a "Renters Rights Report Card," Gross said.</TE>
<TE>   But Katz has said he supports rent control as it "is on the books"
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Gross' group gave Brain an F as well, calling him "the Realtor's
candidate" during his 1995 run for City Council.</TE>
<TE>   "Politically, everyone will say they support rent control," said
Gross, whose organization fought for rent control in Los Angeles in
the 1970s and later in West Hollywood. "It's when you get down to the
details ... the provisions of rent control, then you can see whether
a person really supports it."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the rent control debate, secession backers say new cities
in the Valley and Hollywood would be better equipped to address
housing problems and to do a better job of administering programs
such as code enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is that a new Valley city will be able to get its
own money and set up its own program, tailored to the needs of the
poor and impoverished in the Valley," Brain said.</TE>
<TE>   Social service providers in the Valley have long complained that
they do not get their fair share of federal grants, that the money
flows to other areas of the city.</TE>
<TE>   But in their arguments against a breakup, city officials and
housing advocates point to the creation earlier this year of a
historic $100-million trust fund for affordable housing as a sign
that things are improving.</TE>
<TE>   "In Los Angeles, we've never seen as strong a commitment to
housing as we have now," said Los Angeles City Councilman Eric
Garcetti, vice chairman of the city's Housing and Community
Development Committee.</TE>
<TE>   In the Valley, numerous homeowner associations support secession.
Landlords' support is mixed. Some embrace secession, but others
citywide have said that a breakup would remove so many single-family
homes from Los Angeles that renters would gain influence with the Los
Angeles City Council.</TE>
<TE>   The Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles has not yet taken a
position on secession. The Apartment Owners Assn. of Southern
California opposes the breakup efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "We need the community to stand together to provide the affordable
housing that's needed," said Laurie Nagy, executive director of the
Apartment Owners Assn. of Southern California. State law requires
that every city and county submit a plan for providing affordable
housing. A new Valley or Hollywood city would be required to submit
such a plan.</TE>
<TE>   If people vote for secession on the basis of "the idea that
low-income people are eating up a lot of the city services, they're
going to be eating up a lot more in a Valley city," said Rod Field,
of the Los Angeles Housing Law Center. "They're going to have to
build some low-income housing right away."</TE>
<TE>   Secession backers say the breakup campaign will provide a forum
for housing issues. "People running for mayor and council will
articulate their views on housing, just like every other issue," Katz
said.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn, who is leading the anti-secession effort, has
already highlighted housing in his attacks on the cityhood proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "The key is whether there is going to be the same level of
commitment to housing as there is in Los Angeles," Hahn said. "Would
these new cities make the same commitment out of their budgets? Where
would they find the money to do it?"</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in a packed church in Hollywood in June, Hahn and
Garcetti promised to build 500 units of affordable housing there over
the next three years.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no denying that a new city of Hollywood would not be able
to do this--at least not for three to five years," said Bob Untiedt,
executive director of the Hollywood Interfaith Sponsoring Committee,
which organized the event.</TE>
<TE>   The group's members labeled housing their top concern.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood secession leaders accused the mayor of making promises
he cannot keep.</TE>
<TE>   Thelma Baker, who lives in a mobile home in Pacoima with her adult
children, has yet to decide how she will vote on secession. But
housing issues concern her.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know enough about what they plan to do if they split with
Los Angeles," said Baker. "Right now I live with my kids, [but] who
knows? There might be a time when I have to go into an apartment."</TE>

<HD>Newport Bay Boat Slips Give Berth to Lucrative Side Income
for Residents</HD>
<DH>Boating: Homeowners get slips for $80 a year, then rent
them out for thousands. Officials say they're profiting from public
waters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even people along Newport Beach's Gold Coast can use a little extra
income. Owners of million-dollar homes overlooking Newport Bay are
pocketing as much as $9,000 a year renting out boat slips that the
city allows them to own for a yearly fee of $80.</LD>
<LD>   The practice has been going on for years but appears to have
become more common recently because of a shortage of berths for large
yachts. Some owners of 50-foot yachts must wait as long as three
years to find a slip in the harbor.</LD>
<LD>   Such rentals are permitted by ordinance. But Newport Beach's
Harbor Commission has launched a study to determine how pervasive the
practice is, with some officials expressing concern about homeowners
making profits from public waterways. The city is also considering
raising the annual fee for residents who rent out their berths, and
using the money to maintain the harbor.</LD>
<TE>   "Is it right for people to make money on [public waters]?" asked
Tony Mellum, director of harbor resources. "That's what we are
looking at."</TE>
<TE>   One company formed last year to address the berth shortage acts as
a broker between homeowners and boat owners, posting fliers around
coastal neighborhoods that state, "Turn your empty slip, end tie or
dock space, no matter what size, into monthly income."</TE>
<TE>   The company expects to rent out 200 of the harbor's 1,200
residential slips this year, said Sean Acosta, owner of Newport Slip
Rental.</TE>
<TE>   Finding homeowners interested in renting out their slips--even in
a wealthy place like Newport Beach--hasn't been difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "People will, especially in the midst of uncertain economic times,
do whatever they can to maximize their income," said Acosta. Acosta
has turned the slip next to his home into a berth that accommodates
three 40-foot yachts and one small boat. He won't say how much he
makes from the rentals but said it goes a long way toward paying his
home mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's anything wrong with people picking up extra
income, especially if [the dock] is not being used," he said. "We get
calls every day. I wish I had more slips."</TE>
<TE>   The slips are owned and maintained by residents, but they sit on
water owned by the state and controlled by the city.</TE>
<TE>   "The only private property is the structure itself," said Dave
Kiff, Newport Beach's deputy city manager.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said an increase in the $80 fee could go toward
maintenance of the aging harbor and for water-quality improvements
required by environmental laws. Some money could also go toward
dredging the bay.</TE>
<TE>   "We have more and more responsibility to improve water quality in
the bay, and that's a very expensive proposition," Mellum said. "And
that's going to have to be funded from some source."</TE>
<TE>   The rental issue is a sensitive one to many residents, and few of
those renting the docks are willing to talk about it.</TE>
<TE>   One homeowner recently rented his slip to the owner of a 42-foot
powerboat for $900 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Because it reduces the couple's privacy, "my wife would rather not
have it there," said the homeowner, who asked not to be identified.
"For me, if I'm not using it, it's a few extra bucks a month. Every
little bit helps."</TE>
<TE>   Ray Vincenti, 72, started renting out the slip in front of his
$2-million, 4,200-square-foot home a few years ago when he sold his
boats. Two boats--a 36-footer and 38-footer--occupy the space. Like
other homeowners, he opposes city action to take some of his rental
money.</TE>
<TE>   "I get really appalled at the fact that the city can't live within
their own budgets," he said. Speedboat owner Bill Williams recently
moved from Huntington Harbour to Newport Beach but could not find a
house with a slip. Private yacht clubs in the harbor didn't have
slips available, so Williams contacted Acosta's company.</TE>
<TE>   Acosta had several--at $18 per boat-foot. Williams said the slip
he chose wasn't as close to his house as he would have liked, "but
you have to weigh the pros and the cons."</TE>
<TE>   The slips along Newport Harbor are assigned to properties that
ring the bay. Some are in front of homes; others are within a few
yards. Having one can add $500,000 to $750,000 to the value of a
home. There are no regulations about leasing them.</TE>
<TE>   Some yacht brokers fear that if the city raises the annual fee on
the slips, it could leave even fewer berths available to their
customers. Dennis Riehl of Crow's Nest Yacht and Ship Brokerage said
fewer people will buy his yachts if they must wait years to berth
them in Newport Bay. "The residents have taken up the slack for the
guy who wants a boat in the harbor," he said.</TE>

<HD>Riot of Squid Addles Anglers</HD>
<DH>Fishing: The jumbo variety mysteriously mobs local waters,
which means charter boats are booked solid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine miles off Newport Beach, anglers anxiously lined the railing of
the Nautilus as deckhands scooped basketfuls of anchovies and
sardines into the dark water to entice their prey. The captain
flicked on the boat's intense lights, hoping to attract jumbo squid
to the surface of the pitching sea.</LD>
<LD>   Jumbo squid are a rarity in Southern California waters, but they
seem to turn up during summer in El Nino years. Arrive they have, in
massive numbers along the coast from San Pedro to San Diego.
Thousands upon thousands of the mollusks have been snared daily since
mid-July.</LD>
<LD>   But on this night, the first stop and the second were busts.</LD>
<TE>   "One spot--that's all you need," muttered fisherman Gary Quon of
Lakewood.</TE>
<TE>   Two hours later, though, the 58 passengers of the 70-foot charter
boat found that sweet spot about two miles off Newport Pier. Frantic
bursts of activity broke the silence as the anglers hauled the
water-logged, torpedo-shaped creatures from the cobalt water.</TE>
<TE>   Slapped on the deck, the squid hissed and wheezed, spouting
seawater in a futile effort to propel their way back to sea. They
shot jets of chocolate-colored ink, staining clothing and irritating
skin.</TE>
<TE>   Two hours later still, the soaked, exhausted and exhilarated
anglers had captured 170 jumbo squid.</TE>
<TE>   Debbie Reider, 31, of Huntington Beach was among the first to land
one. She caught five by late Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   "When you pull them up, they turn incandescent pinks and greens
and blues. They're beautiful creatures," she said. "We have fun at
their expense.... You get drenched and they squirt all over the
place."</TE>
<TE>   Reider, a member of the South Bay Lady Anglers who has fished
since childhood, had just returned from an Alaskan fishing trip with
a catch of halibut, salmon and yellow-eye tuna. A big seafood dinner
is scheduled tonight, and now she had her appetizer nailed.</TE>
<TE>   Popularly called giant squid, they are typically found in the warm
waters off Mexico, Chile and Peru. Fishermen say the creatures show
up every few years off Orange County, usually before an El Nino
winter. "Every time the squid come up, they circle Newport," Quon
said.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows why they come. Some speculate that warm currents
carry them, or their food source, from their home waters. Others say
the reproduction rate has risen. Marine biologists say the answer is
elusive.</TE>
<TE>   The squid this night were about 2 feet long, weighed up to 4
pounds and came in a rainbow of colors, their luminous flesh marked
by the deepest indigo to lemon yellow. The lilac tentacles and arms
were delicate and wispy.</TE>
<TE>   In a little more than a week's time, about 65,000 jumbo squid have
been caught in Southern California waters, according to
www.sportfishingreport.com. It started slowly--a mere 15 squid on
July 17--and skyrocketed to 16,378 four days later. Once word spread,
twilight charter boats have been booked to capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Their presence has been impossible to miss in Newport Beach. Not
only was there an armada of brightly lighted squid boats on the
horizon each night, but hundreds of people lined Newport Pier hoping
to bring in a catch.</TE>
<TE>   Aboard the Nautilus, people wore ponchos or slickers, even garbage
bags, to try to keep dry. They wielded fishing rods with special
lures called "squid jigs," which look like tasty morsels to the jumbo
mollusks.</TE>
<TE>   Two brothers aboard were competing for prizes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I got one!" yelled one, Gabriel Jordan, 11, of Irvine.
"This better not be an old boot."</TE>
<TE>   A deckhand helped him, but at the last moment, the squid's body
snapped, leaving only its parrot-like beak on the end of the line.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what he gets for running my line," he said, before stowing
the beak in a burlap bag.</TE>
<TE>   Hours later, the boy triumphantly reeled in an intact squid. "You
are mine!" he yelled at the limp creature hanging from the end of his
line. "I can't believe I finally got one!"</TE>
<TE>   His brother, Adam, 14, won the $80 jackpot for the heaviest
squid--about 4 pounds. "Hopefully, we're dividing it," Gabriel said,
hinting broadly.There was an air of weary exuberance aboard. A
deckhand grabbed a squid, sliced off the head and fins and cleaned
the body. Galley cook Trisha Woodbury, 20, cubed the white flesh and
quickly grilled it in butter, garlic salt and black pepper before
passing it around.</TE>
<TE>   Vista resident Bill York and his 18-year-old son, Cliff, had gone
squidding earlier in the week but threw away the heads and fins. That
did not go over well with York's mother-in-law. So the York men and a
friend were back.</TE>
<TE>   The night's haul--"Probably 20, though we'd like to say 30," the
elder York said--would go to the mother-in-law intact.</TE>
<TE>   "Her Japanese friends will come over and she'll make five gallons
of squid miso soup, squid sushi and about eight other Japanese dishes
I've never heard of," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Quon, who planned to take his catch to his favorite sushi
restaurant in Gardena, called the night's haul "a little scratchy."
But he said he was glad for the four he did catch.</TE>
<TE>   "In another week," he said, "they'll be gone."</TE>

<HD>'Death Valley Scotty' Truly Had the Golden Touch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CECILIA RASMUSSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Grapevine Canyon, a region of Death Valley often called the land
of mirages, sits Scotty's Castle, a scenic gem and a testament to the
man who helped bring fame and tourism to this scorched area of the
3.3-million-square-mile Death Valley National Park.</LD>
<LD>   The man who became identified with the lowest, hottest spot in the
Western Hemisphere was born Walter Edward Scott in Kentucky in 1872.
He spent his boyhood on the harness-racing circuit and other
adventures before joining up with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show as a
trick rider.</LD>
<LD>   In 1902, using his flair for showmanship and a few gold nuggets
from Colorado, he claimed to have hit the mother lode in Death
Valley. That generated some press coverage. Soon, he snookered a
wealthy New York banker into giving him a $4,000 grubstake in
exchange for almost a quarter of his profits. The banker was also
unlucky; when he became disillusioned with Scotty, he filed suit--and
lost. Scotty was a talented gold digger, all right--but he mined
people, not the earth. With the banker's money in his pocket, he
bragged about his secret gold mine and tore $100 bills in half to
make change. He bought rounds of drinks for gullible listeners in
bars from Barstow to Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Word of his supposedly fabulous find reached mining promoter E.
Burton Gaylord, who offered to be a silent partner. Gaylord, a
huckster himself who sold shares in phony gold mines, bankrolled
Scotty to make him living proof of Death Valley's bounty.</TE>
<TE>   Scotty had no problem dreaming up scams and being the front man to
get people to invest. Nor did he have trouble spending other people's
money. He paid thousands of dollars to ladies of the evening, whom he
said needed it more than anyone, and he bought diamonds to ornament
the shoes of his mule, Slim. In July 1905, Scotty walked into the Los
Angeles Times city room wearing his trademark 10-gallon hat, cowboy
boots and red tie and announced his discovery of the biggest gold
mine ever.</TE>
<TE>   The city editor showed him the door. Shrugging his shoulders,
Scotty stepped into the bar across the street, tossed a $20 gold
piece at the bartender and ordered a round of drinks for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   He boasted loudly with his usual guff about Indian fights and a
big bonanza gold mine. But it was his talk of chartering a special
three-car train for $5,500 (with Gaylord's money) to beat the speed
record from Los Angeles to Chicago that caused Times executive Harry
Chandler and editorial writer Walker Jones, sitting in a booth
nearby, to prick up their ears.</TE>
<TE>   Convinced that Scotty's publicity stunt would make good copy,
Chandler ordered the paper to cover Scotty's two-day train trip,
making him a national legend.</TE>
<TE>   On July 9, Scotty fought his way through the crowd at Los Angeles'
Santa Fe depot before hopping aboard to join his wife, Josephine. As
the train whistle sounded, Scotty rolled up his sleeves, grabbed the
shovel from the fireman and began shoveling coal into the glowing red
firebox.</TE>
<TE>   The entire nation followed the "Coyote Special." As the train sped
along the 2,265-mile journey, bulletins were flashed from the
railroad to the press. Cheering crowds lined the tracks.</TE>
<TE>   When the train arrived at Chicago's Dearborn Station on July 11 at
11:45 a.m., two days later, it had covered the entire distance in 44
hours, 54 minutes, breaking the old record by nearly eight hours. The
record would stand unmatched for more than 30 years, until the advent
of diesel locomotives.</TE>
<TE>   Newspapers loved Scotty for decades. They never seemed to tire of
creating new titles for him, including "Sphinx of the American
Desert" and "King of the Desert Mine."</TE>
<TE>   Gaylord's money ran out while Scotty was in Chicago, but it didn't
take Scotty long to recruit a replacement. The indefatigable Scotty
conned and charmed Chicago businessman and millionaire Albert Johnson
into bankrolling his still unseen gold mine.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Scotty's first benefactor, however, Johnson came west in
1909 to see his investment. Scotty met him at the Santa Fe station in
Los Angeles with a pack of mules, planning to tire out the city
slicker and send him packing.</TE>
<TE>   But Johnson fell in love with Death Valley. The dry heat was good
for his asthma, and horseback riding soothed an old back injury.
Instead of shooting Scotty for selling him shares in a nonexistent
mine, the millionaire formed an improbable friendship with the con
man.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1920s, with Scotty's help, Johnson found a suitable site,
nourished by underground springs, and built an elaborate 18-room,
$2-million Spanish hacienda.</TE>
<TE>   Scotty spread the word that his secret gold mine was financing the
project. "I'm building myself a castle so I can sit back and laugh at
the world," he said. It became known as Scotty's Castle.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson and his wife, Bessie, a popular radio evangelist, went
along with the myth while Scotty enjoyed his extravagant lifestyle.
Johnson would later say that Scotty repaid him with laughter and
friendship.</TE>
<TE>   Building the castle took nine years--after which the Johnsons
spent much of their time in the West.</TE>
<TE>   In Death Valley, meanwhile, Scotty used his elaborate quarters to
entertain such visitors as Errol Flynn, Will Rogers, William Randolph
Hearst, John Barrymore and Carrie Jacobs-Bond, composer of such
syrupy standards as "I Love You Truly." Oddly enough, Scotty himself
slept in lesser accommodations down the road in his cabin.</TE>
<TE>   Scotty spent Johnson's money with flair and always with an eye for
headlines.</TE>
<TE>   On one of his frequent trips to Los Angeles, he paid a man $100 to
give up a second-floor downtown hotel room. Scotty opened the window
and started throwing dollar bills, triggering a traffic jam. He was
arrested on charges of disturbing the peace, but he didn't hold a
grudge. When the cops released him, he took several reporters, the
arresting officers and the police chief to heavyweight boxing
champion Jim Jeffries' bar on Main Street and bought them all several
rounds of drinks.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't his last encounter with the law. In the 1920s, Scotty
walked into a Nevada bank and saw the bank's president, his friend,
signing a stack of uncut sheets of $20 bills. (Back then, bank
presidents were required to sign each bill before putting it into
circulation.)</TE>
<TE>   Scotty persuaded his friend to sell him five uncut sheets at face
value for $2,500. With his sheets of uncut 20s in his pocket, he
caught a train for Los Angeles and joined an on-board poker game.
Ordering a round of drinks, he took out his pocketknife and cut off a
$20. Handing it to the porter, he told him to keep the change. When
the whiskey was gone, he repeated his little show.</TE>
<TE>   When the train stopped for lunch at the Harvey House in San
Bernardino, one of the poker players called the U.S. marshals and
told them of the counterfeiter. Two marshals and a Treasury inspector
were waiting for Scotty in Los Angeles with handcuffs.</TE>
<TE>   After the fiasco was straightened out the next day, the man who
lived by the motto "always leave 'em wondering" bought drinks for
everyone. The next morning, the newspapers headlined: "Scotty's Back
in Town."</TE>
<TE>   The myth began to unravel in 1941, when one of his original
backers, the luckless banker, sued him for a quarter of his gold-mine
profits. Scotty, then 69, admitted in court that his honestly won
riches had never existed.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson testified that he had lent Scotty more than $200,000,
funded Scotty's son's education and paid Scotty's wife's alimony.</TE>
<TE>   "Scotty just likes to spend money. And I like to see him spend
it," Johnson said with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson remained Scotty's friend to the end. When Johnson died in
1948, he bequeathed Scotty's Castle to the Gospel Foundation of
California, which he and his wife had founded, but he gave Scotty the
option to continue living in it. Scotty did, holding court there
until his death in 1954.</TE>
<TE>   The castle, named for the man who lived in it rather than the man
who built it, was sold in 1970 to the National Park Service for
$850,000. Today, it attracts 70,000 tourists a year.</TE>
<TE>   When Scotty died at age 81, he was buried next to his dog, Windy,
on the hill behind the castle under an imposing wooden cross. A
bronze plaque quotes him: "I got four things to live by: Don't say
nothing that will hurt anybody. Don't give advice--nobody will take
it anyway. Don't complain. Don't explain."</TE>
<TE>   Death Valley Scotty lived by his own advice.</TE>

<HD>Woman, Man Die in Lennox Gun Battle; 1 Man Hurt</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A gun battle early Saturday in Lennox that began over a restraining
order left a man and a woman dead and a third person wounded,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Emma Gonzalez, 24, a high school clerk, was killed shortly after
midnight after trying to serve a restraining order on a man who
members of her family said had been stalking her, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Fabian Acuna, 27, who lived two blocks from Gonzalez, argued with
her in front of his home in the 10800 block of Mansel Avenue near
Hawthorne Boulevard. Then Acuna pulled out a handgun, said Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Steve Jauch.</LD>
<TE>   "He shot [Gonzalez] once in the upper torso," Jauch said. Then
Acuna opened fire on Gonzalez's boyfriend, who was sitting in a car
in front of the house, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Tiegs, 32, was shot twice in the upper body, but was able
to get his gun and return fire. Acuna was shot in the chest and later
died at a hospital, authorities said. Gonzalez died at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Tiegs ran to Gonzalez's home, said the woman's sister. "He
screamed, 'He shot her, he shot her!' " said Eliana Gonzalez, 15. "I
was shocked. I cried for hours.... My parents aren't handling it too
well."</TE>
<TE>   Tiegs was hospitalized in stable condition.</TE>
<TE>   Emma Gonzalez was a records clerk at Leuzinger High School in
Lawndale, her sister said. She had graduated this year from Cal State
Los Angeles and wanted to teach social science. "She was very
outgoing. She made friends everywhere. And she was very
hard-working," Eliana Gonzalez said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities identified Acuna as Gonzalez's ex-boyfriend. But
family members said Acuna had been a friend of one of Gonzalez's
older brothers and became obsessed with her.</TE>
<TE>   "He started liking her in high school. Eventually it got to the
point where he wouldn't leave her alone," the victim's sister said.</TE>
<TE>   She said she didn't know why her sister tried to deliver the
restraining order in person.</TE>

<HD>Storage Companies Tapping In to Wine</HD>

<LD>For some collectors, aging fine wine is as simple as a stroll to the
cellar.</LD>
<LD>   But others have little access to the dark and silent
temperature-controlled havens where the grapes of worth are stored.
Instead, they stash cases of wine in bedroom closets and on top of
refrigerators where hefty investments easily can turn sour.</LD>
<LD>   In the last year, though, at least four Southern California
self-storage facilities have opened wine cellars for enthusiasts who
don't have their own. The rows of compartments, which contain
everything from a grandmother's old furniture to the remains of
households shattered by divorce, now also hold vintage vino, kept in
conditions optimum for aging.</LD>
<TE>   "It hasn't really proven itself yet, but it's definitely a new
trend," said Bill Hobin, president of the California Self Storage
Assn. "We're seeing a strong demand from consumers in the baby-boomer
population who want to store anything from one bottle to 400 cases."</TE>
<TE>   Following the lead of self-storage owners in Anaheim, Pasadena and
Malibu, Jay Sundher has included 1,000 square feet of wine space in
his newly expanded Thousand Oaks facility.</TE>
<TE>   Sundher, who plans a $6.4-million transformation of Thousand Oaks
Self Storage into the newly dubbed Hollywood Storage Center, said he
did an extensive marketing survey on wine. The result is a dimly
lighted, locker-lined room kept at 55 degrees Fahrenheit and 70%
humidity. It has a refrigeration system that can run off a backup
diesel generator in case of blackouts and a wine-tasting room for use
by clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an incredible demand for this, especially in the Conejo
Valley," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cellar Masters in nearby Westlake Village has been cashing in on
that demand for years. Primarily a builder of wine cellars, the
business also stores wines for more than 100 collectors. A cooling
technician is on 24-hour call should the temperature unexpectedly
fluctuate.</TE>
<TE>   With fees as low as $16 a month, Sundher expects to triple his
wine storage area in a year. He plans to open the cellar in early
August.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanne Bartlett, head of a 200-member wine appreciation club
called Ventura County W.I.N.O., won't be a customer. She has a
refrigerated armoire that holds 750 bottles of wine. Such systems can
be costly and noisy, and to keep down the din, Bartlett stations hers
in the garage.</TE>
<TE>   "It might also be why I have a fairly high electric bill," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Appealing to wine aficionados is part of a strategy to dress up
the drab business of self-storage, industry experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to get away from the metal shed look," said Tom Litton, a
Lodi-based self-storage owner and consultant. "In the South, they're
experimenting with a colonial plantation look. In California, you see
fountains. We don't want to look any different than a Marie
Callender's or other nice retail outlets."</TE>
<TE>   In Thousand Oaks, Sundher has opted for a show-business theme.</TE>
<TE>   Wax figures of Marilyn Monroe and Arnold Schwarzenegger will grace
the lobby, courtesy of the Sundher family's Hollywood Wax Museum. A
wall-mounted TV will continuously show "The Wizard of Oz," "E.T." and
other family films.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, storage comes from a negative experience, like divorce,
the loss of a loved one or a business downsizing," Sundher said. "We
wanted to make it a more fun environment."</TE>

<HD>The Dangers of Sexualizing Our Children</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE HUDASH</AU>
<BD>Julie Hudash is an Irvine-based freelance writer who
focuses on children's issues.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Advice on how to protect our children from sexual predators is flying
around suburban neighborhoods faster than F-14s over the White House.
Parents haunted by the terror of Samantha Runnion's kidnapping and
murder are desperate to ensure the safety of their young ones.</LD>
<LD>   It's never been more clear that monstrous predators exist in all
areas of society. No profession or economic class stands immune:
clergy, scouting, teaching--there are even allegations that a local
judge, with child pornography on his computer, molested a 14-year-old
boy.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, society pressures children into the world of
adult sexuality.</LD>
<TE>   The natural lines meant to protect children have become
dangerously blurred as children, especially girls, have become
burdened by the inappropriate transfer of adult sexuality. This
doesn't cause criminal behavior, nor can it serve as an excuse. But
it also can't be regarded as benign.</TE>
<TE>   The night Samantha's body was found, I listened to four guests on
"Larry King Live" discuss the murder. One thing they all agreed upon:
the connection between such crimes and child pornography.</TE>
<TE>   Child pornography has exploded on the Internet. This availability
encourages the pedophile's sick desire to sexually exploit children.
Punishment for creating, distributing or promoting child pornography
must be swift, and legislation needs to be in place to lock up these
sociopaths.</TE>
<TE>   The terrifying reality of pedophilia, coupled with societal
pressures on children to dress and act suggestively, leads to a
volatile mixture. This is where parents must take up the fight.</TE>
<TE>   I find myself juggling conflicting motivations. I try to teach our
children to be confident and empowered by saying things like "Believe
in yourself, and you can be whatever you want to be." Then a voice
from deep within says, "But you don't really want to play in the
frontyard, do you?"</TE>
<TE>   We must protect these most innocent and vulnerable citizens from a
home-bred form of terrorism. Aside from child pornography, children
are being dangled as sex objects within the inescapable world of
advertising. Recently, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch became embroiled in
controversy after it began selling thong underwear for young girls.</TE>
<TE>   Girls in elementary and middle schools feel pressured to keep up
with the sexy image of pop star Britney Spears, and retailers are
cashing in on the fashion craze.</TE>
<TE>   I recently took our preteen daughter shopping for school clothes.
It shouldn't be too difficult, I thought, because I had just two
requirements. Shirts had to cover the navel, and pants couldn't leave
hipbones exposed. It required visits to four stores to find
appropriate clothes.</TE>
<TE>   A colleague shared a story that illustrates the disappearing
boundaries separating childhood, adolescence and adulthood. While
shopping at Limited Too, a clothing store popular with pre-teenage
girls, she noticed padded bras on sale. She asked the store manager
and got this casual response: "Well, you can't imagine how flat some
of these girls are!" Exactly! Because they are children, not women!</TE>
<TE>   These kinds of experiences should send parents complaining to
management and boycotting the offenders. Where will we draw the line?
When our school-age children are wearing stilettos and string
bikinis?</TE>
<TE>   Just as kids learn math and reading, they need to learn to
understand the visual messages on TV, in music videos, on the
computer and in print that bombard them. They must learn critical
thinking skills to keep from falling victim to the damaging messages.</TE>
<TE>   I'm a mother of five young children. I don't claim to be an expert
in criminology, but I can't disregard the potential impact that the
over-sexualizing of our children potentially can have on dangerous
pedophiles.</TE>
<TE>   Pedophiles are like dry forests during the peak of fire
season--unassuming but potentially dangerous. We can't stop all
fires, but we can become aware of the risks and refuse to allow our
children to be the spark that ignites disaster.</TE>
<TE>   The pain Samantha's family is enduring is unimaginable. More than
flowers, teddy bears and condolence cards, the best way to illustrate
that her shortened life served a greater purpose is to fight to
protect other children.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha was probably too young to have been affected by the
pressure society places on girls. But it's so sadly true that she
wasn't too young to fall victim to the undeniable evil in the world.</TE>
<TE>   I can't imagine the terror that Samantha Runnion endured in the
last hours of her life. In the words of Marc Klaas, another parent
whose daughter was kidnapped and murdered: "No one can turn their
backs on this crime anymore."</TE>

<AU>PAUL PFLUEGER</AU>
<BD>Paul Pflueger is a Laguna Beach resident who teaches
at a local community college.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I believe that effective teaching should communicate certain ideas:
It matters what a student thinks, students should question orthodox
views, though not necessarily reject them, and students should
actively try to bring about change.</LD>
<LD>   These concepts are the cornerstone of a viable democracy. When
they're ignored, we shouldn't be surprised by low voter turnout and
the inertia that results in special-interest groups controlling the
political agenda.</LD>
<LD>   During 25 years of teaching in public schools, I have found these
concepts too often are discouraged. And, when these positive
educational concepts are embraced, teachers are bound to offend or
embarrass some colleagues and administrators.</LD>
<TE>   The Times' June 22 article on Garden Grove teacher Janet Ewell
("Removed School Paper Advisor Says Opinion Pieces Did Her In")
appears to be an example of a distressingly familiar pattern. Ewell
was removed from her journalism class because her principal,
embarrassed by students' criticisms in the student newspaper, wanted
to silence their voices. Apparently, rather than addressing student
complaints about bathrooms, school lunches and teacher availability,
he removed the advisor.</TE>
<TE>   My comments may be of value because of my experience under similar
circumstances. I have refused to arbitrarily inflate grades or "dumb
down" the curriculum. I have been openly critical of administration
policies, so the superintendent several years ago tried to fire me
from my teaching position.</TE>
<TE>   The student newspaper that Ewell advised had criticized some
teachers for not being available before and after school for students
who needed extra help. The newspaper complained about hairs and flies
found in cafeteria food and criticized administrators for the small
number of functioning bathrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Student newspapers are supposed to reflect student reporting on
topics and events of their choosing, and to contain editorials that
reflect their views on issues of significance. There are obvious
reporting and editorializing limits that cannot be crossed, but
Ewell's class seems to have crossed none of them.</TE>
<TE>   To quote Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas: "First Amendment rights
... are available to teachers and students. It can hardly be argued
that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to
freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate."</TE>
<TE>   A free press guarantees that someone's feelings may get hurt. If
readers object to the students' opinions, they can make their case in
letters to the editor. I understand that the high school paper
printed six responses from teachers. Readers then can draw their
conclusions based on evidence and their own experiences.</TE>
<TE>   People must also remember that history demonstrates hurt feelings
often lead to productive and important changes. The credibility of
those who want to censor and silence critics is always suspect. What
do they fear?</TE>
<TE>   I know that some superintendents and trustees don't like their
phone numbers and addresses made available. Criticism might prove to
be embarrassing, but it should be considered an honor to hear from
those who care enough to get involved.</TE>
<TE>   I hope that Ewell receives a fair hearing and that her union
provides adequate advice and assistance. Sadly, I wouldn't bet on
either.</TE>
<TE>   The 1st Amendment issues raised by Ewell's school newspaper should
form the basis for a debate. These are real and important issues.
However, district officials and the principal could simply state that
they control teaching assignments, and that it was time for a change
in the journalism class.</TE>
<TE>   My experiences with a teachers union make me skeptical about Ewell
getting adequate help. Sometimes union representatives are more like
district lap dogs than teacher advocates. The school district that
tried to fire me subsequently offered me another job in the district,
but I instead chose early retirement and am teaching at a community
college.</TE>
<TE>   I urge Ewell's students, their parents and the community to get
involved in this case. Nothing less than the 1st Amendment and a
quality education are at stake.</TE>
<TE>   Recall Voltaire's statement: "I disapprove of what you say, but I
will defend to the death your right to say it." Maybe some of the
people running our schools never learned about democratic concepts.
If not, let's remind them.</TE>

<LD>Re "Sewage to Be Fully Treated," July 18:</LD>
<LD>   Congratulations on achieving your objective. Orange County should
be very proud for setting an example to all of the other polluting
cities in the country. The cost is minimal compared to the payoff.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing should be dumped in our oceans, and I hope to see urban
runoff soon diverted to treatment. Why not catch the first two days
of rain? After that, the pollution levels would be greatly decreased.</LD>
<TE>   Cleaning up our mess is the future. Thank you for giving this
issue the coverage it needed. Shame on you, Orange County Sanitation
District board members who voted against a cleaner ocean environment.
We must start somewhere.</TE>

<TE>   I'm so happy to hear that the Orange County supervisors are siding
with the environmentalists and vowing to clean up the sewage. I'm an
old lady on a fixed, small income and am in favor of cleaning up the
sewage. I can spare the $16 that it will add to my taxes. This is a
rich county and we've been acting like a Third World country by
polluting the ocean. Go for it, supervisors!</TE>

<TE>   Re "The Choice: Cleaner Sewage or Lower Taxes?" July 16:</TE>
<TE>   I lived in Orange County for over 20 years before pursuing a
career in marine biology, which allowed me to travel the world
studying the ocean. The tiny country of Bonaire, in the Netherland
Antilles in the Caribbean, is on the verge of investing millions of
dollars to treat its sewage. Bonaire recognizes the primary
importance of protecting its most precious resource--its magnificent
coral reef.</TE>
<TE>   The wide, sandy beaches and clean, cold surf of Orange County are
among the county's most precious resources, fueling the powerful
economic engine of tourism as well as providing spiritual nourishment
and a playground for millions of harried working people. The EPA's
waiver is a good example of poor environmental policy, one that
reinforces the status quo instead of providing incentives for
improvement.</TE>
<TE>   The auto industry complained about the high costs of fuel
efficiency and safety belts, but ultimately figured out
cost-effective ways to provide these societal benefits. Let's harness
American ingenuity to figure out a cost-effective way to responsibly
keep sewage out of the ocean.</TE>

<TE>   Re "State OKs Bleach Use for Ocean Sewage Line," July 20:</TE>
<TE>   I share the concerns expressed at the end of the article on use of
bleach to treat sewage, as bleach has been shown to react with sewage
to form toxic and carcinogenic byproducts, such as chloroform. While
the Orange County Sanitation District should be encouraged in its
efforts to reduce existing biological hazards associated with the
discharge of sewage, it is important that new chemical hazards not be
introduced.</TE>

<TE>   Re " 'Dr. Sewage' Pushes Treatment of Water With a Practiced
Approach," July 8:</TE>
<TE>   I have had the privilege of working with Jan Vandersloot, a.k.a.
"Dr. Sewage," and the Ocean Outfall Group since March 2001. During
this time I have been a constant observer of Jan's leadership style.
I was impressed and intrigued in how he was easily able to enlist
support from people and build his team, and how he interacted with
his peers, elected officials and staff members on the Orange County
Sanitation District.</TE>
<TE>   His leadership skills, patience, knowledge of the issues and keen
ability to work with a full spectrum of individuals have contributed
to the huge success and respect he enjoys today. His ability to unite
a broad group of people says a lot about Jan as a person. He was
always open-minded, welcomed ideas and encouraged everyone to
participate. He recognized that it was through the collective hard
work of the Ocean Outfall Group and countless others who joined the
do-us-a-favor, get-rid-of-the-waiver effort that resulted in the
historic vote by the sanitation board. The world is a better place
because of "Dr. Sewage."</TE>

<LD>Re "There's No Such Thing as a Free Way in L.A.," Steve Lopez column,
July 21:</LD>
<LD>   The idea that driving should cost more raises many questions about
the future of transportation in Southern California. It's true that
toll roads serve a purpose, but contrary to opinions stated by Lopez,
transportation officials should do everything in their power to keep
money in the public's pockets while balancing that with the
challenges of maintaining mobility throughout the region.</LD>
<LD>   Greater taxation, even in the form of more user fees, may not be
the answer.</LD>
<TE>   To correct Lopez's statement regarding the 91 Express Lanes
tollway noncompete agreement: It was Caltrans and the state of
California--not the Orange County Transportation Authority--that
signed the agreement prohibiting any expansion or capacity
improvements to the public freeway until 2030. The agreement was
needed to help provide assurances to the Wall Street investors who
wanted to make sure their investment in the toll road would not be
negatively impacted.</TE>
<TE>   When the toll road was built in the mid-1990s, it served the need
to relieve congestion at a time when the state had no funds to
improve local freeways. It was the best alternative at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, much has changed. Housing costs have risen
dramatically, forcing more people who work in Orange County to seek
affordable housing in Riverside County, putting an even greater
strain on the Riverside Freeway corridor.</TE>
<TE>   The noncompete agreement was necessary to secure financing in the
past.</TE>
<TE>   However, it is now preventing a much-needed increase in capacity
on the Riverside Freeway corridor. OCTA's purchase of the tollway
will be the first step in resolving that issue.</TE>
<TE>   By buying the Express Lanes and eliminating the noncompete clause,
OCTA will be able to make immediate improvements to the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   We will be able to increase traffic flow by improving
interchanges, solving choke-point problems, re-striping lanes and
expanding the freeway, thus meeting the goal of enhancing mobility
for motorists.</TE>

<LD>Re "Helping to Shut Illegal Clinics," July 21:</LD>
<LD>   I'm all in favor of shutting down bad clinics, but sometimes the
FDA is wrong.</LD>
<LD>   I personally know of someone who was given up for dead after
chemotherapy failed to work, then went to using alternative medicine
and the cancer went away. This person went to an underground Chinese
medicine cure that is an example of what the FDA commonly tries to
shut down.</LD>
<TE>   For another example, read what happened in Florida. The problem
started when an oncologist complained to the FDA that some people
were using an unapproved cancer drug, aloe extract, instead of the
chemotherapy. Aloe extract had a history of success since 1996 with
over 600 patients in the U.S. and other countries.</TE>
<TE>   Your article talked about county officials, not the FDA, and about
going after bogus drugs, but I can't help being a little skeptical.
Will this effort be an excuse for similar crackdowns?</TE>

<LD>Re "Dreary, Dollar-Driven Race," July 21:</LD>
<LD>   As a reader since the early '50s, I have not always agreed with
The Times' positions, but I heartily endorse today's lead editorial,
"Dreary, Dollar-Driven Race." Voters would be better served if Gov.
Gray Davis would spend less time dialing for campaign dollars and
posing for shameless photo-ops and devote more of his taxpayer-funded
hours to the state's energy policy, stalled budget negotiations and
quality of life.</LD>

<HD>Five U.S. Soldiers Injured in Battle</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Troops are ambushed near Pakistani border,
triggering a firefight that kills two Afghan coalition members and
three enemy fighters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Five U.S. soldiers were wounded and two Afghan militia members were
killed Saturday in a four-hour firefight that erupted as the allied
units approached a compound in southeastern Afghanistan, U.S.
military officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Only one of the Americans was seriously wounded, and none
sustained life-threatening injuries, said Army Lt. Col. Jim Yonts, a
spokesman for U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Fla., the military
headquarters for the war in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   The soldiers were part of a "small unit conducting reconnaissance
of a suspected enemy stronghold," Yonts said.</LD>
<TE>   "What resulted was an ambush," he added. "They were approaching
the compound when they were fired upon."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. troops who entered the compound after the battle subsided
reported finding three enemy fighters dead, Yonts said.</TE>
<TE>   Another enemy fighter was wounded and taken into U.S. custody.</TE>
<TE>   The incident was one of the bloodiest encounters for U.S. troops
since seven Americans were killed in March at the outset of Operation
Anaconda, a major battle in eastern Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials did not release the names of the wounded soldiers.
All were evacuated to the U.S. air base at Bagram, north of Kabul,
the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the fight erupted around 1 p.m. at a walled
compound 12 miles east of Khowst, a city near the Pakistani border.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. units nearby joined the battle, although a military spokesman
at Bagram said fewer than 100 coalition troops were involved on the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. troops also called in close air support from Army AH-64
Apache attack helicopters, Air Force A-10 Warthog ground attack
aircraft and F/A-18 fighter jets.</TE>
<TE>   The aircraft used cannon and machine-gun fire against the
attackers, a spokesman at Bagram said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and Afghan units have been regularly patrolling the rugged
and largely lawless region in an effort to root out remnants of Osama
bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network and the deposed Taliban
government.</TE>
<TE>   Allied units exchanged heavy fire with the enemy fighters inside
the compound for about four hours, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear how the fighting concluded, how many enemy
fighters escaped or whether those inside the compound were Al Qaeda
or Taliban operatives, Yonts said.</TE>
<TE>   The shootout offered fresh evidence that there are still pockets
of well-armed enemy fighters in Afghanistan, even though U.S.
officials say most Al Qaeda operatives in the region have fled to
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The fighting came on the heels of stepped-up attacks on allied
units after a July 1 incident in which a U.S. warplane strafed a
wedding engagement party, killing 48 Afghan civilians. All but three
were women and children.</TE>
<TE>   That attack is still under investigation by the Pentagon. Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld reiterated last week that military
leaders believe that the U.S. plane was taking antiaircraft fire--not
merely encountering celebratory gunshots, as Afghans have reported.</TE>
<TE>   But the episode has angered many Afghans and prompted a string of
apparent reprisals. One day after the attack, a military convoy was
fired upon and a U.S. soldier was shot in the foot. On four occasions
since then, U.S. units have encountered small-arms fire, grenade
attacks and mortar rounds.</TE>
<TE>   The last American killed in Afghanistan was a National Guardsman,
Sgt. Gene Arden Vance Jr., 38, of West Virginia, who was killed May
19 after his unit came under heavy fire while on patrol in the
eastern part of the country.</TE>

<HD>Jet Crash at Air Show in Ukraine Kills 78</HD>
<DH>Accident: The two crew members eject safely. More than 100
in the audience are injured.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>An aerobatics stunt went horrifically wrong in Ukraine on Saturday as
a fighter jet plunged to the ground, sliced through a crowd of
spectators and exploded, killing at least 78 people in the world's
deadliest air show disaster.</LD>
<LD>   The SU-27's two crew members ejected to safety, but 115 others on
the ground were injured. Authorities said they expected the death
toll to increase.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of bodies lay sprawled on the Sknyliv airfield in the
western Ukrainian city of Lviv after the crash shattered a serene
summer day. Many others sat dazed and bloodied. The air was filled
with the screams and cries of panicked or injured people.</LD>
<TE>   People rushed to ambulances holding limp children in their arms,
and others made announcements over the public address system calling
for loved ones to come forward.</TE>
<TE>   A woman shook a motionless body lying on the ground, repeating her
name, "Nadya, Nadya."</TE>
<TE>   Ukrainian President Leonid D. Kuchma flew to the scene,
immediately setting up a government commission to investigate and
vowing that those responsible would be brought to justice.</TE>
<TE>   Hours later, Kuchma fired the commander of the Ukrainian air
force, Col. Gen. Viktor Strelnikov. The commander of the 14th Air
Force Division also was dismissed; there was no explanation, however,
on whether safety guidelines had been breached.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the Defense Ministry said it was too early to say what
caused the crash. But Sergei Babakov, a Defense Ministry spokesman
speaking in a phone interview with The Times from the capital, Kiev,
said the most likely cause was engine failure as the plane flew close
to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "The pilots were helpless--they could not do anything with the
plane, and the only thing they had left was to eject. That saved
their lives," he said. He added that human error had not been ruled
out.</TE>
<TE>   The reputation of Ukraine's military was dented severely last
October after 78 people aboard a Russian passenger jet were killed
when the plane was hit by a stray Ukrainian missile fired during
Black Sea military exercises. Ukrainian authorities at first
emphatically denied responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   In Saturday's disaster, Russian television stations aired
terrifying footage of the plane sinking dramatically after it failed
to come out of a difficult aerobatics roll, brushing a tree, clipping
another plane and hitting the runway, where it hurtled on its wing
and nose, spraying shrapnel at spectators.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses described human limbs being hurled through the air as
the plane sheared through the spectators.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,500 people had gathered for the air show to celebrate the
60th anniversary of the 14th Air Force Division, based at Lviv.</TE>
<TE>   Svetlana Bachinskaya, 34, made a spur-of-the-moment decision to go
to the air show with two of her sons--Mikhail, 7, and Roman, 12, both
eager to attend.</TE>
<TE>   She had begun moving her sons toward the exit shortly before the
crash, but they begged her to stay for the heavy plane aerobatics.</TE>
<TE>   "So we sat down on the grass, without going back to the center of
the field," she said. "And that saved our lives.</TE>
<TE>   "God, I am so grateful that we moved away from the place where it
all happened. If we had stayed where we were originally seated, we
would have been killed for sure," she said, crying.</TE>
<TE>   "What we saw next was a sheer nightmare. The plane had already
flown above us twice, and this time it was coming down on us with a
horrible unbearable noise, flying at a very low altitude, right above
people's heads.</TE>
<TE>   "Then all of a sudden, there was an unnatural silence and the
plane started to clumsily tilt to the left."</TE>
<TE>   After the plane exploded, there was a wave of heat, as if she had
been pushed into a sauna, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "And there was stuff in the air--pieces of metal, debris, people,"
she said. "It was the worst sight I have ever seen in my life."
Vladimir Dzhas, 12, who was with his father, Vasily, when the plane
crashed, at first thought that the massive fireball was part of the
show, "just like one of those explosions that they show on TV, not
for real.</TE>
<TE>   "But when I looked at my dad and saw that he was standing all
pale, I realized that something terrible happened. I have never seen
my father as pale as that. And then I felt really scared.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw many people in panic. They did not know what to do and were
running around screaming. There were a lot of people on the ground. I
have never seen so much blood in my life."</TE>
<TE>   In the seconds after the crash, he said, it was "like in a silent
movie--the plane, the people and the smoke. And then it felt like
someone took cotton pads out of my ears. All of a sudden it was very
loud, and the screams of people around us were tearing my ears
apart."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to the local television station in Lviv, President Kuchma
said he would consider banning air shows because of the crash.</TE>
<TE>   "People should deal with their concrete military activity," he
said. "No such shows should take place."</TE>
<TE>   He said the pilots were highly experienced; Vladimir Toponar, 45,
and Yuri Yegorov, 49, were both colonels. Kuchma said, however, that
much of Ukraine's military hardware had passed its use-by date.</TE>
<TE>   Ukrainian air force Maj. Gen. Vadim Hrechaninov, a former advisor
to the president on military matters, told Russia's Interfax news
agency after viewing footage of the crash that safety measures
appeared to have been inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   "The main trouble was the lack of adequate safety precautions on
the ground that could have helped the pilots to maneuver away from
the crowds in an emergency," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the plane was flying too low and may have been in
disrepair.</TE>
<TE>   A flight recorder was recovered after the crash.</TE>
<TE>   The SU-27 fighter, code-named Flanker by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, has been in service since the mid-1980s and has a
reputation as a reliable and highly maneuverable aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Reports on an engine failure were sketchy and unconfirmed. But the
cash crisis that has hit air force units in former Soviet states has
led to problems with spare parts and servicing.</TE>
<TE>   An SU-30, an updated version of the SU-27, crashed at the Paris
air show in 1999, but both pilots ejected from the plane, which fell
about half a mile from the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Another of the world's worst air show disasters was at the U.S.
air base in Ramstein, Germany, in 1988, when three Italian air force
jets collided during a complicated maneuver, and one crashed into the
crowd, killing 70 and injuring 400.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Indonesian navy has impounded seven ships that were attempting to
smuggle thousands of tons of sea sand to Singapore, the state-run
Antara news agency said.</LD>
<LD>   Col. Adyaman As told the agency that the ships did not have proper
documentation to export the sand from the Indonesian province of
Riau, a few miles from Singapore.</LD>
<LD>   The smuggling of sand has caused a diplomatic row between the two
countries in recent months. Singapore reportedly needs the sand to
expand its territory.</LD>
<TE>   Indonesian officials say the loss of so much sand is fast becoming
an environmental headache.</TE>

<LD>A hard-line Islamic court banned the leading opposition party and
ordered 33 leaders imprisoned for as long as 10 years each. The court
said Freedom Movement leaders acted against national security with
the intention of "overthrowing the establishment."</LD>
<LD>   The court is one of several hard-line institutions controlled by
nonelected clerics who have thwarted the reform efforts of President
Mohammad Khatami since his landslide 1997 election.</LD>
<LD>   Those who received prison terms, ranging from four months to 10
years, remain free and have 20 days to appeal.</LD>

<LD>Mikhail Kalashnikov said he was proud of inventing the assault rifle
that bears his name but wishes he had designed something to help
people instead.</LD>
<LD>   "I would have preferred to invent something which helps people and
makes life easier for farmers. A lawnmower, for example," he told
Bild newspaper in Germany.</LD>
<LD>   The Kalashnikov, which can fire hundreds of rounds per minute and
is light and easy to maintain, has become the weapon of choice for
guerrillas and insurgents across the globe.</LD>

terrorists," said Kalashnikov, 82, who was in Germany to open an

<LD>New Zealanders gave Prime Minister Helen Clark a historic second term
after she called early elections to capitalize on a strong economy
that pulled the country through a global slump largely untouched.</LD>
<LD>   Draped in flower necklaces, Clark said in Auckland that she will
try to form a minority coalition government. Her Labor Party won 52
seats in the 120-seat Parliament, up three from the last election.</LD>
<LD>   Clark, a 52-year-old former political science university lecturer,
is the first New Zealand woman to win back-to-back elections. Her
main campaign pledge was to offer three more years of stable
government.</LD>

<DL>LINZ, Austria</DL>
<LD>A grenade blast sprayed tiny metal pellets and shrapnel through a
discotheque filled with young Balkan immigrants early Saturday,
injuring 27 people, Austrian police said.</LD>
<LD>   The explosion ripped through the X-Large Disco in Linz, about 100
miles west of Vienna, leaving patrons, most younger than 20, with
tiny steel balls embedded in their skin and bodies, a doctor said.</LD>
<LD>   Police would not say whether they believed the blast was
intentional.</LD>
<TE>   Experts said the grenade was designed to injure, not kill.
Grenades like it are readily available on the black market in Eastern
Europe and the Balkans, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The wounded were taken to nearby hospitals, and all but two were
released, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Those two will have to undergo surgery, but neither appeared to
have life-threatening wounds, a doctor said.</TE>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli ground troops backed by helicopters scoured the southern West
Bank on Saturday in search of Palestinian gunmen who killed four
people in an ambush near Hebron.</LD>
<LD>   Soldiers searched the village of Yatta and surrounding areas where
the militants are believed to have fled after the deadly shooting
Friday, the army said.</LD>
<LD>   The attack raised fears of a surge in violence after an Israeli
airstrike that killed 15 Palestinians in Gaza City on Tuesday,
including nine children and Salah Shehada, the military commander of
the Islamic group Hamas.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told the German magazine Der
Spiegel that the strike was "100% a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   "The outcome shows clearly we used the wrong weapon," Peres said
of the 1-ton explosive used in the strike.</TE>
<TE>   The four Israelis who were killed near Hebron were ambushed in
their cars. Three of the dead were identified as a married couple and
their child from the Psagot settlement near the West Bank city of
Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations Security Council, meanwhile, put off until
Monday its debate over an Arab-backed resolution condemning Israeli
military actions.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, John D. Negroponte,
told a closed Security Council meeting that the resolution was
one-sided and that the United States would oppose it, a U.S. official
said on condition of anonymity. The resolution expressed sympathy for
Palestinian victims of 22 months of bloodshed, but it made no mention
of Israeli victims or Palestinian attacks.</TE>

<HD>Follow Jesus Early, Pope Tells Youths</HD>
<DH>Religion: 'Do not wait until you are older' to take the
holy path, he counsels in Toronto.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>In a homily that was more motivational speech than sermon, Pope John
Paul II challenged half a million young Catholics here Saturday to
become "a new generation of builders [who] must learn to build, brick
by brick, the city of God within the city of man."</LD>
<LD>   The three-hour evening service--called a vigil in Catholic
parlance--is the final warmup event for World Youth Day before
today's climactic papal Mass, which organizers predict will draw 1
million people. John Paul established World Youth Day 15 years ago to
bolster the younger generation's commitment to the church.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking just after the sun set on a warm Canadian night, the
pontiff built on the theme that he began last week at the opening
ceremony: Jesus Christ is the cornerstone of a happy life and
compassionate society.</LD>
<TE>   "God is entrusting to you the task, at once difficult and
uplifting, of working with him in the building of the civilization of
love," said the 82-year-old pope from his large white-and-gold chair
on a platform high above Downsview Park, an abandoned military base.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of thousands were to spend Saturday night in sleeping
bags and makeshift tents on the former base's runways and fields to
be ready for the early morning Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, John Paul steered clear of mentioning the sexual abuse
scandal that beset the Roman Catholic Church this year. Instead, the
pontiff has used his three public appearances to encourage young
Catholics to become "the salt of the earth ... the light of the
world"--the theme for this year's World Youth Day--by following the
countercultural example set by Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   "Let the light of Christ shine in your lives," he said. "Do not
wait until you are older in order to set out on the path of holiness.
In the quest for justice, in the promotion of peace, in your
commitment to brotherhood and solidarity, let no one surpass you."</TE>
<TE>   With John Paul as the star attraction, millions of young Catholics
usually make the pilgrimage to World Youth Day, which is held about
every two years. But only slightly more than 200,000 participants
have registered for the Toronto event, though the crowds have swelled
considerably during the pope's public appearances. Organizers blame
travelers' post-Sept. 11 concerns and the uncertainty of the pope's
health for the downturn.</TE>
<TE>   The surprising stamina that the ailing John Paul displayed earlier
in the week continued late Saturday. His voice remained relatively
strong as he spoke from prepared text in English, French, Spanish,
Italian and Polish.</TE>
<TE>   In a concession to the advances of Parkinson's disease and the
pope's other maladies, aides wheeled him onto the stage on a small
platform and he remained seated throughout the service.</TE>
<TE>   The pope will fly to Guatemala on Monday for the second leg of his
11-day trip in the Americas.</TE>

<HD>Powell to Shore Up Terror War</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell arrived Saturday in India on the
first leg of an ambitious eight-nation Asian tour to help defuse
regional tensions and beef up cooperation in the so-called second
fronts in the war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   During his eight-day mission, Powell hopes to prod nuclear-armed
rivals India and Pakistan into a dialogue, discuss military
cooperation with the Philippines and Indonesia, and finalize an
anti-terrorism accord with the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations, or
ASEAN. The pact, the first of its kind, could serve as a model for
other regional blocs, U.S. officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration's goal is to prevent the post-Sept. 11
momentum from dissipating in the aftermath of the war in Afghanistan
and the arrest of alleged Al Qaeda operatives and associates around
the world. The United States hopes to set in motion mechanisms for
greater practical collaboration as well as agreements that will
ensure future support for its efforts.</LD>
<TE>   But the challenges for Powell were underscored by the tough stance
taken by India on defusing its crisis with Pakistan over the
Himalayan region of Kashmir, which both nations claim. A terrorist
attack by Kashmiri militants on India's Parliament late last year
brought the two states to the brink of war. A million troops remain
deployed along their border.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before Powell's arrival, Indian Foreign Minister Yashwant
Sinha charged that New Delhi had been betrayed by Pakistan's failure
to end militants' cross-border infiltration into the Indian-held
portion of Kashmir, which like Pakistan is predominantly Muslim.
Although tensions had decreased since U.S. mediation last month,
extremist infiltration continues, he said in a CNN interview.</TE>
<TE>   "There must be a decisive, complete, a permanent end to this
cross-border terrorism," Sinha said. "Only then shall we be in a
position to resume our dialogue with Pakistan."</TE>
<TE>   Powell arrived in the region as fighting escalated along the Line
of Control dividing the Pakistani- and Indian-held portions of
Kashmir. Fierce artillery barrages, the heaviest in weeks, were
reported Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate terrorist attack, at least two civilians were killed
when gunmen threw grenades at a crowded market in Budgam, west of
Srinagar, the summer capital of India's Jammu and Kashmir state.</TE>
<TE>   En route to India, Powell acknowledged that he didn't expect any
breakthroughs on the Kashmir situation.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to see what both sides might be willing to do to keep us
from going down that escalatory ladder," he said. "I will certainly
explore possibilities and see what reciprocity might exist between
the two sides, if either side took certain steps."</TE>
<TE>   Powell will hold more meetings with India's top leadership this
morning and then fly to Pakistan to talk with President Pervez
Musharraf in the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The United States hopes that India's plan to hold local elections
in Kashmir in early fall will help address demands for greater
autonomy and diminish support in India's only Muslim-dominated region
for the militant separatist movement.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said he will encourage the government of Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee to hold "free, open, fair and inclusive"
elections in Kashmir so that all parties that want to run will be
given a place on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "I will be encouraging them to encourage moderate participation,
participation of all parties in the election process," Powell said en
route to India.</TE>
<TE>   The United States will also urge India to allow independent
observers to monitor the elections to prove to the world that they
were held freely, he told reporters traveling with him.</TE>
<TE>   Powell plans to tell Musharraf that Pakistan should do everything
possible to ensure that no terrorist attacks, border infiltration or
other actions disrupt the vote.</TE>
<TE>   He will also press Musharraf on the need to be vigilant about Al
Qaeda and the former Taliban rulers of Afghanistan "drifting over the

<TE>   Powell acknowledged that the United States is concerned that
Islamabad, distracted by the Kashmir crisis, "might remove some of
its focus" from the Pakistani-Afghan border, where many Al Qaeda and
Taliban fighters are believed to be operating.</TE>
<TE>   Powell will then fly to Southeast Asia for visits to Thailand,
Malaysia and Singapore and a meeting with 10 ASEAN leaders and 22 of
his Asian counterparts in Brunei.</TE>
<TE>   The pact that the United States hopes to sign in Brunei is still
under wraps, but it is expected to include increased collaboration on
intelligence and stemming the flow of terrorist funds.</TE>
<TE>   On the last two legs of his visit, Powell will explore closer
counter-terrorism cooperation with the Philippines and Indonesia,
both of which are plagued by Muslim separatist movements.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue to explore with the Filipinos how to move
forward with our joint training exercises," Powell said. "We stand
ready to assist our friends and work with our friends in ways that
they want."</TE>

<HD>Japanese Workers Are All Work, Little Play</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Summer. A time to relax, head for the beach, forget about work and
enjoy that hard-earned vacation so you're bright and fresh in
September.</LD>
<LD>   Unless you're the average diligent Japanese, that is. Despite
growing pressure from government advisory groups, mental health
experts, regulators and even economists to take more vacation, the
Japanese aren't listening.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the trend in the world's second-largest economy is in the
opposite direction. Japanese nowadays take just 49.5% of their 18-day
vacation allowance, the government says. That's the fifth consecutive
nose-to-the-grindstone reduction, down from 61.1% during the holiday
heyday of 1980.</LD>
<TE>   This contrasts with the stress-buster French and Germans, who take
virtually every minute of the six weeks they're allotted, according
to comparative figures by the Japanese government, and Americans on
average take three-quarters of their 17 days allowed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in charge of worker health issues at my company, and I'm
always trying very hard to get people to take more time off," says
Masaaki Nozaki, 29, a manager with the benefits department of a
Japanese bank. "But they just don't listen."</TE>
<TE>   Does Nozaki follow his own advice? "I guess I'm a bit of a
hypocrite," he admits sheepishly. "I only take around eight of my 20
days."</TE>
<TE>   Masako Hirano, a 56-year-old construction executive, says that at
most he takes two vacation days a year. He estimates that he's left
600 days on the table over the course of his career. Most companies
let people carry their vacation days over for one year before losing
them.</TE>
<TE>   Multiply that pattern across the labor landscape and you've got
400 million vacation days annually the Japanese aren't enjoying--and
should be, according to the government-funded Institute for Free Time
Design.</TE>
<TE>   In a proposal issued in June dubbed "Columbus' Egg"--a phrase
meant to evoke Japan's rebirth, not a breakfast dish--the group urges
Japanese to goof off more in order to unleash $100 billion in leisure
spending, help reduce stress, improve mental health and spur national
vitality. There's even talk of passing a basic vacation law to nudge
people further.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people think they shouldn't take holidays because the
economy's so weak," said Hisaya Yanagida, a project manager at the
institute. "We need to turn that thinking on its head."</TE>
<TE>   Corporate foot soldiers on the economic front lines counter,
however, that taking more time off isn't practical, as restructuring,
layoffs and work overload take their toll. The vacation days Japanese
used in 2000, the most recent figures available, don't include 14
official and a few other customary holidays.</TE>
<TE>   "We should be able to have fun without feeling guilty, but the
pressure is getting more intense," says Emiko Iwasa, a planning
official with the Japan Hotel Assn. "I'm in the leisure industry, yet
even I can't afford any leisure."</TE>
<TE>   More subtle factors also play a part. In Japan's group-based work
culture, analysts say, individual responsibilities tend to be less
defined than in the West, while vacation time is seen as more a
privilege than a right. As a result, those who take off often feel
they're letting co-workers down.</TE>
<TE>   "I tend to feel guilty if I'm vacationing and they're working,"
said Sachiyo Yoshida, a 59-year-old finance company worker.</TE>
<TE>   The notable exception is when everyone takes off at once. What
results are nightmarish traffic jams, sky-high hotel rates and
enormous aggravation during the big holidays as everyone heads out of
town in a giant scrum.</TE>
<TE>   "The crowds and expense are a real drag during Golden Week and New
Year's," said part-time office worker Michiko Awano, 38. "But that's
how it goes."</TE>
<TE>   The interplay of guilt, concern and duty sometimes means that time
off becomes more acceptable when it's linked to an obligation. Thus,
weddings, funerals and family illnesses are often cited as reasons
for the four or five days of personal time people actually use.</TE>
<TE>   "But if you just say you're going fishing, going to have fun or
[to] watch a baseball game, that's difficult," said Shinichi Kaneko,
a 76-year-old janitor. "Only if everyone's doing something is it all
right."</TE>
<TE>   An added problem for those in the generation born shortly after
the war is that many devoted their lives to the company and never
learned how to take it easy, mental health experts say. One result:
The prospect of more than a short amount of free time can be pretty
daunting.</TE>
<TE>   "They often believe they live to work," said Toru Sekiya,
president of the Hatsudai Sekiya Neuro-Psychiatric Clinic. "The
government needs to encourage them to slow down, open their minds,
spend more time on their relationships."</TE>
<TE>   One possible solution, said Yanagida of the free-time institute,
is creating classes to teach people to have fun. The "lifelong
seminars" given to so-called salary men who are preparing to leave
their companies could serve as a model. "They invite someone in who's
having fun and let people listen to their experience," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Younger Japanese tend to have far less company loyalty, fewer
illusions about lifetime employment and more interests outside work.
Student Shinobu Kanari, 21, said companies that let her take a full
vacation will top her list after graduation.</TE>
<TE>   But this age group also is at the bottom of the economic ladder.
As a result, any change in the work culture could take a long time.</TE>
<TE>   Breaking long-standing cultural patterns also gets into delicate
issues of hierarchy. Most Japanese won't leave the office at night
before their bosses do, for instance, even as bosses say they feel
guilty leaving before subordinates.</TE>
<TE>   "It feeds on itself," says Hidehiko Sekizawa, director of Hakuhodo
Institute of Life and Living, the research arm of an advertising
agency.</TE>
<TE>   Even foreign firms--where top executives are under fewer cultural
constraints and generally have no qualms about leaving early or
taking vacations--find themselves fighting an uphill battle.</TE>
<TE>   Garry Evans, strategist with HSBC Securities, said his firm nagged
one employee for months until he took a week off, only to discover
he'd slipped in over the weekend to "catch up."</TE>
<TE>   "Getting many of our Japanese staff to take their breaks is one of
the single biggest issues that come up in annual performance
reviews," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say most Japanese wouldn't love to break away if it
were socially acceptable. Awano says she'd travel in Europe. Nozaki
would hop on the trans-Siberian railroad, and Yoshida dreams of
studying art in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   So far, however, a lot of fun is relegated to wish lists. Japanese
are rich, enjoy an advanced society and some of the best hardware in
the world, said Yasuyuki Takimoto, chairman of Airlink Travel Agency,
which took out full-page newspaper ads that read, "Let's All Take
Time Off."</TE>
<TE>   "The software we don't have, the area where we're anything but
rich," he said, "is free time."</TE>

<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>Vice President Krishnan Kant, who occupied India's second-highest
ceremonial position, died Saturday of a heart attack, doctors said.
He was 75.</LD>
<LD>   Kant, whose tenure began in 1997 and was to end next month, had
been admitted to a New Delhi hospital complaining of severe chest
pain.</LD>
<LD>   India's vice president is the chairman of the Rajya Sabha, the
upper house of Parliament, but has few other powers.</LD>
<TE>   Kant was born Feb. 28, 1927, in Punjab state. He was imprisoned
during colonial British rule for taking part in movements opposing
the government, according to his official biography.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his political career, he was a strong proponent of
India's efforts to acquire nuclear weapons. Kant was also one of the
founders of the People's Union for Civil Liberties, a human rights
group.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>VALLEY PARK, Mo.</DL>
<LD>A transient was accused Saturday of abducting, trying to rape and
ultimately killing a 6-year-old girl who he allegedly snatched from
her father's suburban home.</LD>
<LD>   St. Louis County warrants charge Johnny A. Johnson, 24, with
first-degree murder, armed criminal action and attempted forcible
rape in Friday's killing of Cassandra "Casey" Williamson, who
vanished from the home where Johnson also had spent the night.</LD>
<LD>   Cassandra's body was found blocks away at an abandoned glass
factory, where police say Johnson sometimes slept. Johnson told
police the body's location, investigators said.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson was jailed without bond Saturday in the St. Louis County
Jail in Clayton. It was not immediately clear when he would make his
first court appearance.</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy on Cassandra's body was planned for Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   A St. Louis County Police Department news release on the charges
against Johnson did not specify how Cassandra died or other details
about the case. It said only that "detectives from our agency were
able to build a strong case against [Johnson]."</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis County Police Chief Ron Battelle told NBC's "Today" show
Saturday that Johnson had confessed to the slaying. He declined to
comment on a motive.</TE>
<TE>   Battelle said Johnson was the last person seen with Cassandra, and
he was seen carrying her piggyback down the street Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson spent the night at a home shared by Cassandra's father,
Ernie Williamson, and a roommate.</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Williamson said that he had known Johnson only a few days
and that Johnson was sleeping on the couch Friday morning.
Authorities said Cassandra was in the kitchen about 7:30 a.m. with
her father. Williamson said he was about to pour his daughter a bowl
of cereal and left the room briefly to go to the bathroom. When he
returned, the girl, barefoot and dressed in a white nightgown, had
disappeared.</TE>

<HD>Standard for Tail Fins Probed in N.Y. Crash</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Boeing Co. says it goes beyond FAA design
requirements and its planes wouldn't have crashed under the forces
endured by the Airbus jetliner.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The crash of a jetliner in New York last year after its tail fin
ripped off is prompting investigators to question whether government
structural standards are tough enough, according to sources close to
the inquiry.</LD>
<LD>   Boeing Co. has informed federal investigators that the tail of its
comparable Boeing 767 airliner would not have broken under the forces
experienced by the Airbus A300-600, said three sources familiar with
the investigation.</LD>
<LD>   Both the Airbus and Boeing planes meet Federal Aviation
Administration structural standards. But Boeing imposes two
additional requirements for its tail fin design, beyond four that are
mandated by the FAA, a company document indicates.</LD>
<TE>   American Airlines Flight 587 crashed shortly after takeoff from
New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on Nov. 12, killing
all 260 on board and five people on the ground. The pilots lost
control soon after the Airbus crossed the wake of a larger plane
ahead of it.</TE>
<TE>   The National Transportation Safety Board has reached no
conclusions yet about what caused the accident. It was the second
deadliest airplane accident in U.S. history, after a 1979 disaster in
Chicago that killed all 271 aboard and two people on the ground.
Bernard Loeb, the agency's former aviation safety director, said the
Airbus accident raises "significant issues" about the adequacy of the
FAA standards.</TE>
<TE>   "It is critically important that the NTSB get into these issues,
because it is the only oversight that exists on the part of the
public," Loeb said. "I have concerns about the closeness of the FAA
and the industry. There is no oversight of the design and
certification process if the NTSB isn't there."</TE>
<TE>   Airbus said in a written statement that comparing Boeing planes
with its own "can easily be misleading." The company did not respond
to the specific question of whether its tail fin design goes beyond
minimum FAA standards, citing trade secrets and NTSB rules barring
disclosure of accident investigation data.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is this," the Airbus statement said. "While our
designs are proprietary, the [tail fin] on the A300-600--as on all
our aircraft--was designed and demonstrated to meet or exceed all
certification criteria established by the FAA and European
certification authorities."</TE>
<TE>   Airbus, a European consortium, is vying with Boeing for dominance
of the world airliner market. It is unusual in the field of accident
investigation for one manufacturer to get involved in a case dealing
with another company's plane.</TE>
<TE>   FAA spokesman Les Dorr defended the agency's standards. "There is
no information that has come out of the accident investigation to
date that would cause us to think any change needs to be made to the
requirements. Obviously, if any such information does come to light,
we would review it and determine what the proper course of action
should be." Dorr also warned against comparing planes built by
different manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   The tail fin is one of the strongest parts of an aircraft. Also
known as the vertical stabilizer, it helps keep the nose of the plane
pointed in the direction the pilot wants to fly. The loss of a tail
fin would render a plane uncontrollable.</TE>
<TE>   "The vertical fin is very much like the feathers on an arrow,"
said aviation safety consultant Barry Schiff, a retired airline
captain. "If you remove one or more of those feathers, the arrow
becomes no more than a stick and just wobbles through the air. This
airplane was an arrow without its feathers."</TE>
<TE>   NTSB experts are analyzing Boeing's findings about the strength of
its 767 jetliner to see if the comparison is valid. They are "trying
to understand the nuances and differences ... to see if [Boeing is]
talking apples to apples," said one source close to the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   No conclusions have been reached.</TE>
<TE>   "Boeing may have [an airplane] that is designed way above the
standard, and Airbus may have one that is designed to the standard,"
said the source, who asked not to be identified. "There are design
standards which people are supposed to meet. If someone breaks a
tail, then there is an issue with those standards."</TE>
<TE>   The FAA standards are intended to safeguard the tail fin from such
forces as extreme gusts of wind or pilots aggressively using the
aircraft's rudder.</TE>
<TE>   The rudder is a movable panel attached to the rear edge of the
tail fin. It helps to keep a plane on course when landing or taking
off in a crosswind, or when an engine fails. Jetliners have big,
powerful rudders, and pilots use them sparingly in normal flight.</TE>
<TE>   Flight 587 experienced a series of rudder movements in opposing
directions during the final seconds before the pilots lost control.
The NTSB now believes those movements were most likely the result of
pilot actions, but it remains unclear why the pilot would have moved
the rudder back and forth.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA standards address sharp movements of the rudder. The
standards are highly technical, but essentially, they represent
individual steps of a hypothetical flight maneuver. The rudder is
turned fully in one direction, held and then suddenly returned to
neutral.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA's hypothetical maneuver is supposed to represent a
worst-case scenario. A manufacturer must certify that its design is
at least 50% stronger than the hypothetical worst case. This added
safety margin is called "ultimate load." Engineers rely on
mathematical calculations and data from various kinds of tests to
certify to regulators that their designs will hold up under ultimate
load.</TE>
<TE>   Airbus has told NTSB investigators that its calculations indicate
that Flight 587 experienced forces beyond the A300 design limits, its
"ultimate load," said another source familiar with the investigation.
But Boeing told the NTSB its engineers tested several scenarios that
involved manipulating the rudder of its 767, and "it would appear to
them that their loads were below ultimate," the source added. "If you
are below ultimate, you wouldn't break the tail."</TE>
<TE>   According to this source, Boeing obtained data on the forces
experienced by the Airbus plane and then calculated the effects of
those forces on its plane. The NTSB then asked Boeing to do
additional tests.</TE>
<TE>   "They tried to get the worst possible scenario, and they [were]
getting loads below ultimate," said the source.</TE>
<TE>   The Boeing standards raise the bar on what the FAA requires.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the company calls for its aircraft to withstand full
rudder in one direction followed by full rudder in the opposite
direction. (The FAA only requires a full turn in one direction,
followed by a quick return to neutral.)</TE>
<TE>   "The net result of this approach is that there has been no
catastrophic structural failure of a Boeing airplane due to pilot
control input in 40 years of commercial operations involving more
than 300 million commercial flights," Boeing said in a recent
bulletin to pilots.</TE>
<TE>   The NTSB has scheduled hearings in October on the crash. Agency
officials have stressed that they are still considering a number of
factors, including the actions of the pilots, the design of the tail
fin , the operation of the rudder controls, possible preexisting
problems with the plane and the performance of the advanced composite
material used to build the tail. The NTSB has rejected a call by some
American Airlines pilots to recommend grounding all Airbus A300s.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of unanswered questions at this point," Loeb
said. "This is a very complicated investigation. The issue is not
solely the structural capacity of the tail. It is a combination of
that and the rudder control system."</TE>
<TE>   If the crash leads to tougher design requirements, manufacturers
literally would have to go back to the drawing board to plan costly
changes to many existing aircraft. Another option would be to impose
higher requirements on new aircraft, while advising pilots to
exercise caution in flying older models.</TE>
<TE>   One surprising caution for pilots already has emerged from the
investigation. The NTSB warned that, even under normal flying
conditions, abrupt, repeated, opposite-direction rudder commands can
break the tail on any plane. Pilots were traditionally instructed
that they could make full use of controls at normal speeds without
damaging the plane.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there has been a miscommunication between the people who
design airplanes and the people who fly them," Schiff said. "Either
we have been trained incorrectly, or this fin had a structural
weakness that should not have been allowed to exist."</TE>

<HD>Monument to Black Americans Is Dedicated Where Slaves
Arrived</HD>
<DH>The South: Unveiling ends 10 years of delay, particularly
over Maya Angelou's inscription.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAVANNAH, Ga.</DL>
<LD>On the cobblestone riverfront where the first slaves arrived in
Georgia, the city unveiled a bronze and granite monument to black
Americans on Saturday, ending a decade of delays and debate.</LD>
<LD>   The monument, depicting a black family embracing with broken
chains at its feet, is the first to honor blacks in a city that has
erected statues of its white founders and Civil War heroes for nearly
two centuries.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm glad we got it up. There were those who really wanted us to
doubt it," said Abigail Jordan, a retired teacher who spent 10 years
and $100,000 of her savings to make the monument a reality.</LD>
<TE>   Jordan fought with city officials over the monument's inscription,
a quotation by author Maya Angelou describing slaves "in the holds of
the slave ships in each others' excrement and urine."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Floyd Adams worried that the quote was too graphic for a
public monument, particularly on the riverfront where throngs of
tourists stroll.</TE>
<TE>   But city officials approved the quotation in May when Angelou
agreed to add a few uplifting words to end the quote.</TE>
<TE>   Engraved in bold letters on the monument's granite base is now the
sentence: "Today, we are standing up together, with faith and even
some joy."</TE>
<TE>   Among those who applauded the wording was Johnnie Simpson of Texas
City, Texas, who drove to Savannah with her friend and granddaughter
for the unveiling.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't see many monuments and statues dedicated to us," said
Simpson, a retired telephone company worker who is black. "It feels
like it's a big deal to me. How many times do you get this close to
see something like this?"</TE>
<TE>   Dow Harris of Savannah disagreed. Harris, who is white, showed up
at the dedication Saturday carrying a sign that read, "Wipe the
excrement off of Savannah's monuments."</TE>
<TE>   "This is inappropriate language to put on a public monument," said
Harris.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan shunned the spotlight Saturday to be with 300 people who
sat through dedication speeches. She said organizers still need to
raise more than half the $500,000 to pay for the monument.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers carried plastic buckets with "help" scrawled on the
sides in black marker, stopping for donations at the dedication.</TE>

<HD>With Stocks Down and Just $44.75 in Backup Kitty, Town's
Still Upbeat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WHITEWATER, Wis.</DL>
<LD>In the middle of the kettles and kames and other rolling remnants of
the last Ice Age, the people of Whitewater are following the tales of
corporate rapaciousness and watching the stock market fall like a
stone down a cliff, occasionally striking an outcropping and bouncing
up, then falling again.</LD>
<LD>   In this university town of 12,000, residents discuss recession and
"The Fed" and their financial futures. And this, it seems, is what
they've collectively decided: The economic forecasters, bankers and
broadcasters should really take a walk in the Kettle Moraine State
Forest, or maybe have a nice cup of tea, and relax a bit. This is
just not the end of the world.</LD>
<LD>   Ronald Crabb is 55, has helped put three children through rather
pricey colleges and hopes to retire sooner rather than later. The
chairman of the Department of Finance and Business Law at the
University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, Crabb's 401(k) and other
investments are not looking so good. But like almost everyone here,
it seems, he's simply not as worried as the news insists he ought to
be.</LD>
<TE>   "The stock market is going to come back," Crabb said. "If it tanks
and doesn't come back ... well, the least of your worries is going to
be the value of your 401(k) plan."</TE>
<TE>   A place where the taverns serve Miller High Life for the
old-timers and New Glarus Copper Kettle Weiss for the university
crowd, Whitewater is a town, like most every other, with promise and
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by some of the very few hills in the Midwest, the area
has increasingly become a destination for hikers and mountain bikers,
many from as far away as Chicago, three hours to the southeast.</TE>
<TE>   Built like much of the state around manufacturing, however, the
city has watched as plant after plant laid off workers as the nation
moves toward a more information-based economy, among them the Parker
Pen factory in nearby Janesville and the Beloit Corp., whose
papermaking operation was the pride of Beloit, just to the south, on
the Illinois border.</TE>
<TE>   But Whitewater also has a university, founded in 1868, with nearly
9,000 students each year--this fall's enrollment figures are about
the same as last fall's--helping level out ups and downs in the
economy with their purchases of clothes, books, pizza.</TE>
<TE>   Unquestionably, this year is different.</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin has well-maintained roadways, clean parks, litter-free
waterways and solid bridges because it has long had one of the
highest tax rates in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   When the economy began to slump, however, the state was entirely
unprepared. The amount in Wisconsin's rainy day fund: exactly $44.75.
Most of that had been donated, as gestures, by various retiring
budget directors who had spent their careers pleading with the
Legislature to finance an emergency fund.</TE>
<TE>   Facing a $1.1-billion shortfall this year, legislators, following
perhaps the most vicious political fighting in state history, decided
to make up the shortfall primarily with funds from the state's
tobacco settlement. That money is now gone, however, and many
state-funded institutions are strapped.</TE>
<TE>   This will be the second year in a row the university, by far the
largest employer in town, has had to give back money the state had
budgeted, between $40 million and $50 million, school officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Still, folks take the messes--local, state and national--in
stride.</TE>
<TE>   As dean of the university's gem, the College of Business and
Economics, Christine Clements knows about the various woes. She's
just not all that worked up about them.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, my 401(k)'s not doing well at all," she said. "And if I
wanted to retire I couldn't do it. There are many people in that
position now. But I'm not ready to retire."</TE>
<TE>   With three children--the oldest is 16--the primary effect of the
falling markets on Clements has been considering to reconsider her
oldest child's college prospects.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we have to decide: Can we go out of state, do we go to a less
expensive school, can we afford a private school or do we stick with
state schools?" said Clements, 47.</TE>
<TE>   Those planning to retire, and retirees, have taken the most abuse
from the falling markets. With the Dow Jones industrial average down
nearly a third since its peak in 2000, some conservative mutual funds
off 30% and riskier ones off 70% and more, people who decided two or
three years ago that they had just enough money to retire are finding
out they may have been wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "I sold my boat," said Jim Edinger, 69, who retired in 2000 after
more than 40 years working various manufacturing jobs. "But I hardly
used it anyway. We can still pay the bills. If we can't, I'll go back
to work."</TE>
<TE>   Mareta Hale-Stoll, 40, who teaches art at two public schools,
hasn't had a raise in two years. She has a pension plan that seems
pretty stable, she said, but nothing on top of that. However, a
family friend who recently passed away left her and her two siblings
a house. "I've never made enough money to put into a 401(k) or
anything," Hale-Stoll said. "This house might be my retirement."</TE>
<TE>   It could be that few people stumble accidentally on Whitewater,
kept away by Wisconsin's befuddling "alphabet road" system, where
Highway Z leads to ZZ, which intersects with N and A--and therefore
residents have always taken care of themselves.</TE>
<TE>   It could be that some residents ride snowmobiles to work in the
winter and find financial hardship not unlike physical hardship:
something to face with a shrug.</TE>
<TE>   Or it may be that Whitewater residents are like many Americans: a
bit nervous, preparing for perhaps leaner times, and maybe even
losing a little sleep over it--but in the end, essentially
optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't watch the news, but my husband clues me in," said Laura
Guthman, 32, who with her husband, Bill, opened a computer store two
months ago. The couple own falling stock in a company Bill used to
work for. " 'We're in a recession, you know,' he says," Laura Guthman
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I say, 'I know, I know. So?' "</TE>

<HD>Flood of Money Targets Drinking Water Security</HD>
<DH>Sabotage: Supplies are considered safe, but utilities and

<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JANESVILLE, Wis.</DL>
<LD>When officials discovered last month that intruders had breached the
security at one of this town's two drinking water reservoirs, they
assessed the evidence, weighed their options and did what any other
water utility would have done after Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   They drained the tank.</LD>
<LD>   Five million gallons of what turned out to be perfectly good water
gushed out of the underground reservoir, flowed through half a mile
of storm sewer pipes and onto the Elks Club parking lot before
spilling across the Riverside Golf Course and into the placid Rock
River.</LD>
<TE>   Aside from that, the decision to flush roughly half a day's water
supply down river caused barely a ripple in this Middle American town
of 60,000. There was no panic. There was no run on bottled water.</TE>
<TE>   And that was precisely the point.</TE>
<TE>   "People have to have confidence in their drinking water," said
Janesville City Manager Steven Sheiffer.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that life-threatening contamination of an American
drinking-water system by terrorists armed with deadly bacteria is all
but impossible.</TE>
<TE>   "It would basically require parking a supertanker full of immense
quantities of poison in the middle of a supply reservoir," said Peter
S. Beering, terrorism preparedness coordinator for the city of
Indianapolis and deputy general counsel for the Indianapolis Water
Co.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that, utilities are spending vast sums--from tens of
thousands to millions of dollars per city--to better secure what all
involved know to be the safest of the country's critical
infrastructures.</TE>
<TE>   Around the country, this homeland security means, among other
things, federally mandated vulnerability assessments, round-the-clock
security guards, covers on formerly open reservoirs, enhanced
computer security, more frequent and sensitive tests for contaminants
and, in some places, higher water rates to help pay for it all.</TE>
<TE>   Officials are also concerned with the possibility of a physical or
cyber-attack that would disrupt the supply of water to homes and
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is in agreement that the loss of public confidence has
to be avoided at all costs," said Rick Hahn, a former FBI agent whose
consulting company devised a security plan for Los Angeles' far-flung
water system.</TE>
<TE>   Beering predicted that eventually "we'll get to the point where
people are no longer interested in dumping money on things you never
see."</TE>
<TE>   But for now, cities and ratepayers appear willing to pay whatever
it takes to buy peace of mind. It has to do "with the city being able
to say, 'This water is safe,' " said Daniel L. Lynch, director of
Janesville's water and wastewater utilities.</TE>
<TE>   Reassuring the Janesville public has meant, among other things,
bolting a 2,100-pound concrete block to the top of the already
virtually unliftable hatch cover. Lynch said: "There's no way in the
world anybody can get into that thing, short of a tank."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Lynch, who believes the recent security breach was nothing
more than a few kids on a dare, will soon oversee the erection of a
fence around the hatch. Earlier this year, the entire reservoir
property was enclosed by a 7-foot-high, barbed-wire-topped fence.</TE>
<TE>   Water systems were at the top of the federal government's
heightened security list even before the terrorist attacks on New
York City and the Pentagon on Sept. 11. A month afterward,
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christie Whitman tried
to reassure a rattled public:</TE>
<TE>   "People are worried that a small amount of some chemical or
biological agent--a few drops, for instance--could result in
significant threats to the health of large numbers of people," she
said. "I want to assure people, that just can't happen."</TE>
<TE>   Despite evidence of terrorist interest--President Bush reported in
his State of the Union address that American troops had recovered
diagrams of public water systems from Al Qaeda hide-outs in
Afghanistan--experts agree that U.S. water systems are, for the most
part, safe from saboteurs.</TE>
<TE>   Water utilities "are in the business of purifying water," said
Beering, the terrorism expert and water company official. They run
hundreds of tests a day on both raw and treated water.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly any poison dumped into a water system would be neutralized
in the water treatment process, agreed Adam Dolnik, a research
associate for the Monterey Institute's Terrorism Project.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, he said, terrorists aiming to kill or sicken large
numbers of people would have to pump substantial quantities of
contaminants into a water supply after it had been treated. That too
is technologically difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't watch every faucet," but increased testing by water
utilities at a greater number of sites since Sept. 11 means detection
of foreign substances is more likely than ever, said Hahn, the
security consultant.</TE>
<TE>   What most worries Hahn is the potential for an attack on a
utility's computer network. The resulting disruption of water service
would have "a tremendous economic impact, as well as a psychological
impact," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   It was concern about computer-related problems that led President
Bill Clinton four years ago to establish the framework for
public-private security coordination. Those Y2K-related
cyber-calamities did not materialize, but after Sept. 11, the network
that was needed to address physical threats to critical
infrastructures was already in place.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA's water protection task force had teamed with the Assn. of
Metropolitan Water Agencies, a trade group, and representatives of
several water utilities. Since Sept. 11, they have focused on
identifying security problems and correcting them.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-bioterrorism bill passed by Congress in May requires all
54,000 water systems serving more than 3,300 people to conduct
vulnerability assessments and develop emergency response plans. The
bill dedicated more than $100 million in federal funds to increased
water system security, much of it in grants to large drinking water
utilities.</TE>
<TE>   But most water systems had not waited for a federal mandate.</TE>
<TE>   In Janesville, 40 miles south of Madison, the pre-Sept. 11
"concept of security was locking the doors behind us," Lynch said.
But almost immediately after the attacks, officials contracted with
consultants for a vulnerability assessment.</TE>
<TE>   Within a couple of months, efforts to fortify the system's central
office, two reservoirs, six wells and 328 miles of water mains had
begun.</TE>
<TE>   Without federal money, Janesville has already spent $75,000 on
water system security and will soon spend $40,000 more. Still on
paper is $150,000 worth of safety measures.</TE>
<TE>   Like other utility directors, Lynch is focusing on two types of
security enhancement.</TE>
<TE>   The first includes physical barriers--fences, locks, bars, motion
detectors, cameras, reservoir covers, hypersensitive testing
equipment and anti-hacking computer programs--designed to deter,
delay and detect potential intruders.</TE>
<TE>   The second consists of stockpiling duplicates of
everything--pumps, pipes, intake valves, testing equipment and the
like--that could be needed if an attack on the physical plant
disrupted water service.</TE>
<TE>   Other places are equally ambitious:</TE>
<TE>   * In Los Angeles, where Department of Water &amp; Power official Hal
Lindsey says there has been "absolutely no credible threat" to the
water system since Sept. 11, Mayor James K. Hahn unveiled a
five-year, $132-million security plan.</TE>
<TE>   The department has already increased the frequency of its water
quality tests and the range of contaminants it tests for, Lindsey
said. In addition, it conducts daily aerial patrols of its facilities
and has 24-hour guard service at each.</TE>
<TE>   Construction of a central monitoring station and installation of
new surveillance equipment and other security measures will begin by
year's end, said Lindsey, the executive director of corporate health
and safety.</TE>
<TE>   * In central Florida, where drinking water comes from hundreds of
feet below ground, at least three government agencies have spent more
than $1 million each on water system security. One county has plans
to spend $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   * North of San Diego, runners, bikers and rollerbladers can no
longer cross Miramar Dam. Concerned that terrorists might use the
popular bike path to attack the dam or pollute the reservoir, the
state ordered it closed.</TE>
<TE>   * In Seattle, where officials spent $4 million on added water
security immediately after Sept. 11, the City Council will soon vote
on a $235-million, nine-year plan to bury seven drinking water
reservoirs and acquire land for parks.</TE>
<TE>   * Officials in Portland are considering a $65-million plan to
replace three reservoirs with underground concrete storage tanks,
temporarily cover two other reservoirs and beef up the water system's
security force.</TE>
<TE>   * And in Wilmington, Del., officials assessed the various threats
to the city and decided the water system was not a priority. But
several new security systems are already in place, and a $1-million
security plan is on the books.</TE>
<TE>   In Janesville, where Suburbans and mid-sized trucks are assembled
at an aging General Motors plant, life is as simple and orderly as
the 4 p.m. shift change. The crime rate is almost nonexistent, and
city officials take the public trust very seriously.</TE>
<TE>   After the reservoir was drained and inspected last month, the tank
was refilled and life went back to normal, as normal as it gets after
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Lynch, staring at the "No trespassing, violators will be
prosecuted" signs posted on the reservoir's security fence, shook his
head.</TE>
<TE>   "This," he said, "is Janesville, Wis."</TE>

<HD>Washington Mayor Eyes Options for Primary Spot</HD>
<DH>Politics: Anthony Williams may have to start write-in
campaign to win Democratic nod.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Mayor Anthony Williams, who is seeking reelection, is considering how
he can get around a decision by the District of Columbia's election
board to deny him a spot on the Democratic primary ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The campaign's lead attorney in the case, Vincent Mark J. Policy,
accused the Board of Elections and Ethics of "a total abrogation of
the law" in ruling unanimously Friday night that Williams lacked the
required 2,000 valid signatures on his nominating petitions. The
three-member board disqualified Williams, even though the registrar
of voters, Kathryn Fairley, said that her review of the 10,240
signatures on the nominating petition came up with 2,235 signatures
that appeared to be valid.</LD>
<LD>   Williams' campaign is considering several actions, including
taking the board's decision to the District of Columbia Court of
Appeals, running a write-in campaign to win the Democratic primary or
running as an independent in November's general election.</LD>
<TE>   "Whatever gets me out the most to the people is something that
appeals to me." Williams said Saturday. "I want to get ... out of the
office and back on the street."</TE>
<TE>   If the mayor mounts a write-in campaign, he will have about a
month to get his message to the voters. If he decides to run as an
independent, his campaign would have to gather 3,000 legitimate
signatures in the same time span.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said he would announce a decision early next week.</TE>
<TE>   Williams planned to campaign door-to-door today, visiting seven of
the city's eight wards.</TE>
<TE>   The board decided against Williams because its members weren't
confident the signatures were obtained in an appropriate manner,
Chairman Ben Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   Among names on petitions were Billy Joel, Kelsey Grammer, Tony
Blair and other specious signatures.</TE>
<TE>   The D.C. Republican Party and an activist group, D.C. Watch, filed
challenges with the board after hearing allegations that many
signatures were forged or were not witnessed by the people who signed
as circulators.</TE>
<TE>   Two circulators, Scott Bishop and Scott Bishop Jr., appeared
before the board Friday, but their attorneys said they intended to
invoke their 5th Amendment privileges when questioned.</TE>
<TE>   Williams campaign co-chairwoman Gwen Hemphill testified Friday
that circulators were paid $1 for each signature they collected
because campaign officials couldn't find volunteers willing to
circulate petitions.</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM CUTCHOGUE, N.Y.</KH>
<HD>Long Island Wine Region Comes of Age</HD>
<DH>Vineyards: It's no Napa Valley, but at a million gallons a
year, the North Fork has significance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL LIEBERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CUTCHOGUE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>When Louisa and Alex Hargrave had the crazy idea three decades ago to
buy up one of the old potato farms on Long Island's North Fork and
replant it with grapes, a neighbor had to tutor them in the basics:
No, farmers can't sleep until 9 a.m. You have to be working by 6,
then keep at it until 6 in the evening, when the firehouse whistle
goes off.</LD>
<LD>   Even after they'd produced their first harvest, other features of
big-time winemaking, such as using fancy oak barrels for aging or
advertising to bring in customers, seemed beyond the reach of their
mom-and-pop operation. "Our pockets weren't all that deep," Louisa
says.</LD>
<LD>   Today, her pockets are far from empty, and she can toast that fact
with bottles from two dozen wineries that now line the North Fork's
country roads.</LD>
<TE>   Three years ago, Hargrave and her now ex-husband sold their
operation for $4 million to Italian Prince Marco Borghese, who put
the family crest on what now is the Castello di Borghese / Hargrave
Vineyard, and where you can stage a wedding for 800 around the
onetime potato barn.</TE>
<TE>   They are not the only new faces bringing cachet to the local
winemaking: Michael Lynne, the co-chairman of New Line Cinema, paid
$7 million for two nearby vineyards, while others have been bought or
planted by the owner of the Houston Rockets basketball team, an heir
to the Entemann's baking fortune and a New York cardiologist whose
medical group looked after the hearts of David Letterman and Larry
King.</TE>
<TE>   The wine trail here--with its tasting rooms, tours and evening
concerts under billowing tents--stretches 20 miles to the fishing
town of Greenport, where a sign outside a vineyard store declares,
"Last winery before France."</TE>
<TE>   But when telecommunications executive Vincent Galluccio threw a
dinner for the local wine barons to celebrate his buying the Gristina
Vineyards for $5 million, he didn't serve his own. "I brought in
California wines," Galluccio noted. "The theme was that our
competition was not the people sitting on your right or left. The
competition is people making these wines."</TE>
<TE>   No one is quite yet equating this sliver of New York to the Napa
Valley. According to the Long Island Wine Council, the 52 vineyards
on the island east of Manhattan--most all on the North Fork--cover
"nearly 3,000 acres." That's a leap from the 17 acres the Hargraves
planted in 1973 but less than 7% of the 44,000 acres covered by
vineyards in Napa Valley, which has 375 wineries; California has
500,000 acres of wine grapes.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, with production of more than 1 million gallons a
year, North Fork winemaking has economic and symbolic significance
for an area that has long been a poor sister to its southern
counterpart. Long Island splits at its eastern end, and the South
Fork got the chic Hamptons, with their broad beaches,
multimillion-dollar summer homes and Hollywood and Wall Street
crowds. The North Fork's more modest vacation trade has never
overshadowed its agricultural and blue-collar heritage. Softball
leagues are far more abundant than country clubs.</TE>
<TE>   There have been a few vineyard failures since the Hargraves
imported vinifera vines and built a tasting room with a polished
mahogany table and an 8-foot-high stained-glass Tiffany window of
"The Sower," based on the Millet painting. But the industry has grown
steadily thanks to a heralded 1988 harvest, some bottles garnering
90-plus on the 100-point Robert Parker system for rating wines, and
with the influx of new proprietors with ambitions matching their
bankrolls.</TE>
<TE>   The Borgheses still tout their winery's status as "Long Island's
first vineyard" but also how Marco's "noble Italian lineage dates
back to 9th century Italy."</TE>
<TE>   His wife, U.S.-born Ann Marie, was among half a dozen vineyard
representatives who met recently in Greenport to plot "how to put, as
a region, our best foot forward." Among their promotions: two wine
country weekends, with renowned chefs cooking at the vineyards, and
annual tastings for Manhattan restaurateurs.</TE>
<TE>   Mark and Kathy Lieb, who made their fortune on Wall Street and
still have a money management firm, not only bought a vineyard but
also opened a "custom crush" facility in Mattituck, where other
owners can make wines without investing in wineries.</TE>
<TE>   "We came here because we wanted to have a simpler life. Now we're
into real estate and wine," Kathy said with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Many got into the field for the romance, only to discover there's
nothing simple about a business that can be wiped out by bad weather
or disease--and may well lose money in the best of times.</TE>
<TE>   But the Liebs recently had one of the experiences they all live
for: A newspaper column by Alain Ducasse, whose Manhattan restaurant
may be the most expensive in the United States, featured a halibut
recipe pairing the dish with a wine from their Lieb Family Cellars,
their $15 pinot blanc 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Lieb reports that the bottle was on the restaurant's wine
list as coming not from the North Fork or Long Island, but merely the
"Atlantic Coast."</TE>
<TE>   Jane Baxter Lynn, executive director of the wine council, tells
the others she recently was at a leading Hamptons restaurant and "it
didn't carry any of our wines." California bottles yes, North Fork
no.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like it was for California 30 years ago," Ann Marie Borghese
says, "when they were trying to get on the menu and the European
wines were their competition."</TE>
<TE>   In the pioneering days of Long Island's wine industry, you built
your business like "an exponential dinner party," recalls Louisa
Hargrave, who has kept her hand, and nose, in the business as a
writer, consultant and judge. "People would come ... and try our
wines, then tell their friends."</TE>
<TE>   Today's owners have public relations and advertising budgets to
"take their brands to a national level," she notes.</TE>
<TE>   Leading that trend was Galluccio, who shopped for wineries in
Italy and France before buying 160 acres in August 2000, not far from
his summer home (though that's down in the fancier Hamptons).</TE>
<TE>   Galluccio decided to position himself as "the French connection,"
hiring a French wine consultant, buying 1,500-gallon wooden
fermenters rather than metal tanks and taking out full-page ads in
Wine Spectator magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Like many of the owners here, his goal was not mass sales but to
create "a cult winery." He thus pared the offerings to two reds and
two whites, hoping to market them through subscription sales rather
than off store shelves. The premiere wine is to be Clos Juvin, drawn
from his and his wife's names, Judy and Vince.</TE>
<TE>   But his image-making, like the North Fork wine industry, is a work
in progress. After first calling his place Galluccio Estate
Vineyards, he's gone less formal, to Galluccio Family Wineries.</TE>
<TE>   There was indeed a family spirit at a "Sunset at the Vineyard"
event one recent weekend. In the aging room, Judy was giving a tour
to relatives from New Jersey. A couple of dogs romped on the lawn
between the rows of grapevines and the back deck of the winery, while
a band played for customers sipping the wines at picnic tables.</TE>
<TE>   "Of all the ventures we've been part of, this is the one that's
most a labor of love," Judy Galluccio says. "Money has nothing to do
with it."</TE>
<TE>   Yet if the wineries may be playthings for owners, they also are
investments. Even if they lose money every year, they can pay off
long term when sold--as long as other fat cats will pay a premium for
the privilege of putting their names on a bottle. That is why all the
owners have a stake in boosting the North Fork image.</TE>
<TE>   Vince Galluccio has many events planned in his bid to turn this
into the next Napa Valley, capped by a pig roast to mark the October
harvesting of grapes.</TE>
<TE>   "Our first one drew 200, and last year's 2,000," he says proudly.
"This year we have over 1,000 reservations already. We've ordered
seven 250-pound pigs."</TE>

<HD>Neighbors Await Change as U.S. Trade Bill Advances</HD>
<DH>Vote: Move to give Bush 'fast track' authority gets a mixed
reaction from Latin leaders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>"Latin America matters" was the message heard early Saturday when the
U.S. House of Representatives approved the trade bill. Whether the
symbolism evolves into anything tangible in expanded trade and
economic growth with embittered southern neighbors is another matter.</LD>
<LD>   South America has felt largely ignored since Sept. 11, and so the
bill giving President Bush "fast track" authority to negotiate a
hemispheric free trade zone and a bilateral free trade accord with
Chile comes as welcome news. The bill would also renew trade
preferences for Andean countries as an incentive for farmers to stay
away from the production of illicit drugs.</LD>
<LD>   Assuming that the U.S. Senate passes it as expected this week, the
bill could restart momentum on a badly stalled Free Trade Area of the
Americas, which is to include every country in North and South
America except Cuba. The target inauguration date of 2005 has been
set for the zone, which would extend the U.S.-Canada-Mexico free
trade area from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego.</LD>
<TE>   But the United States' Latin neighbors feel slighted by a year's
worth of U.S. protective trade measures and U.S. inaction on
Argentina's economic mess. U.S. economic policies are coming under
increasing fire from leaders such as Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the leading presidential candidate in
Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   So the practical problem is whether Bush can overcome the bad
faith that was generated among South American trading partners by
annual $20-billion subsidies to U.S. farmers and the 30% protective
tariffs slapped on foreign steel. Will U.S. Trade Representative
Robert B. Zoellick have any real power to reduce the barriers that
make U.S. markets off limits to many Latin producers of orange juice,
sugar and textiles?</TE>
<TE>   "The issue at this point is not U.S. tariffs, which are already
low. It's nontariff barriers like U.S. anti-dumping claims and quotas
that Latin countries claim are unfair but which Congress holds dear,"
said Barry Bosworth, an economist and senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution in Washington. "I'm not sure what Zoellick can do about
them."</TE>
<TE>   There was mixed reaction to the House vote among South American
leaders who met in Guayaquil, Ecuador, over the weekend. Foreign
Minister Celso Lafer of Brazil said, "Negotiations will be very
difficult," referring to the Free Trade Area of the Americas. Brazil
has said it would not sign such a pact unless tariff and nontariff
protections were modified.</TE>
<TE>   The closeness of the House vote, 215-212, and the Bush
administration's likely attentiveness to key districts dominated by
protected industries mean that any trade negotiations will be
conducted in close consultations with Congress, said Gary Hufbauer of
the Institute for International Economics.</TE>
<TE>   The value of trade as an engine of economic growth is not at
issue. There is common agreement among economists throughout the
hemisphere that increased exports help developing countries to
progress faster, generating more jobs, infrastructure and better
health and social programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Latin American trade is not a narrow issue. It's an issue that
impacts the future of the hemisphere," said John Sanbrailo, head of a
development foundation tied to the Organization of the American
States. "Trade is linked to economic growth, which leads to social
progress, which in turn helps consolidate democratic institutions."</TE>
<TE>   Hufbauer said healthy trade adds 1% to 2% to a country's economic
output. Mexico's relatively stable economy in recent years is due to
the added exports generated by the North American Free Trade
Agreement with the U.S. and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also includes the renewal of the Andean Trade Preference
Act, which lapsed in December and is seen as an affirmation of a
"macro" U.S. approach to drug interdiction in Latin America, said
Sanbrailo, executive director of the Pan American Development
Foundation. The incentives led to the development during the 1990s of
nontraditional crops and farm products, including Colombian
asparagus, Ecuadorean tuna and cut flowers, and Peruvian seafood.
Under the act, these commodities and others could be exported to the
U.S. with low or no duties.</TE>

<HD>Oregon National Guard to Join Battle to Control Fire
Threatening The Dalles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>THE DALLES, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Homes overlooking the Columbia River gorge were threatened Saturday
as a 9,000-acre wildfire was pushed by gusty winds to within two
miles of here and more residents were urged to leave.</LD>
<LD>   About 125 Oregon National Guard troops were on their way to join
the 800 firefighters already at work protecting the city of about
12,000 residents on the river bluffs. Gray smoke billowed from the
gorge, with Mt. Hood and Mt. Adam just visible in the distance.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze grew by 3,000 acres during the night and was only 30%
contained, fire officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Residents of 20 more homes were urged to evacuate Saturday,
bringing the total to close to 250, said Stan Hinatsu, spokesman at
the fire command center. Two outbuildings burned during the night,
but no homes were destroyed, he said. A few outbuildings also burned
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Fire crews struggled against the wind to contain the fire's
northeast flank in steep, hard-to-reach terrain. An additional 400
homes could be threatened if the wind shifts, fire officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Winds in the gorge are the single most significant element. It's
been a very dangerous fire," Hinatsu said. "Our focus is firefighter
safety and defending structures."</TE>
<TE>   Flames were within a few feet of some hillside houses Friday. City
workers in The Dalles abandoned the water treatment plant, taking
with them chlorine and other potentially dangerous materials.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very, very serious situation for the state in terms of
risk for property and life," Gov. John Kitzhaber said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen major active fires, all started by lightning, had burned
258,000 acres in Oregon by Saturday, according to the Northwest
Interagency Coordination Center. More than 10,000 firefighters
battled the blazes.</TE>

<HD>Bush Files Records for Recount Bid: $13.8 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When the 2000 presidential election ended in a virtual deadlock,
George W. Bush quickly raised nearly $14 million to help him win the
Florida recount, taking in money so quickly it surprised even his own
staff.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we were a little bit stunned by the amount we received,"
said Benjamin Ginsberg, a Bush attorney for the recount.</LD>
<LD>   According to documents filed by Bush, the campaign took in $13.8
million, most of it through donations of $5,000 or less. Democrat Al
Gore raised less than one-fourth as much, but generally in larger
contributions.</LD>
<TE>   The Gore campaign, which filed its disclosures more than a year
ago, spent $3.2 million in its losing battle for Florida's 25
electoral votes, mostly from large gifts. Donors included Hollywood
producer Stephen Bing, who gave Gore $200,000, and actress Jane
Fonda, who gave $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Gore campaign had no comment Saturday on Bush's filings.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's recount fund filed the required forms July 15, the last day
of an IRS amnesty program for groups that don't comply, avoiding
millions of dollars in possible fines.</TE>
<TE>   "They obviously begrudgingly disclosed, and did it way after the
fact," said Larry Noble, executive director of the Center for
Responsive Politics. "It's better than nothing, but it would have
been better to have disclosed it when the money was coming in."</TE>
<TE>   Ginsberg said there was no legal obligation to file the
information with the IRS because the Bush recount effort was
organized as part of the larger campaign, unlike Gore's recount
effort. He noted that Bush had posted much of the information on the
Internet months earlier. He said the more detailed figures were
released to avoid controversy about donors.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes an issue off the table," Ginsberg said.</TE>
<TE>   The filings, a stack of documents about half a foot thick, show
that Bush moved quickly to dispatch lawyers and staff members to
Florida, Texas and elsewhere, booking hundreds of plane tickets,
rental cars and hotel rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the campaign paid $13,000 to Enron Corp. and $2,400 to
Halliburton Co. for the use of company jets.</TE>
<TE>   "Eighteen months after the election, we find that the [Bush]
administration literally flew into office on the Enron corporate
jet," said Jennifer Palmieri, a press secretary for the Democratic
National Committee. "As disclosed in this report, it is the
administration's close ties with unscrupulous corporations like Enron
and Halliburton that prevent it from showing real leadership on
corporate reform."</TE>
<TE>   "We used a lot of corporate jets," Ginsberg said, adding that the
campaign paid the equivalent of a first-class airline ticket for each
seat they needed.</TE>
<TE>   Former Enron Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay and his wife also each
donated $5,000, according to the filings.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign spent thousands of dollars on everything from
catering to fast food to telephone service, buying groceries at a
Winn-Dixie store in West Palm Beach and writing checks totaling
$640.92 to House of Masquerades, a Miami costume shop. They bought
U.S. flags and custom embroidery and rented furniture, office space
and computers.</TE>
<TE>   After refusing public funding for the 2000 GOP presidential
primary, Bush raised a record $100 million to clinch the nomination.</TE>

<HD>Dead Found in Truck Hauling Mexicans</HD>
<DH>Crime: Authorities say a rig with dozens of people inside
drove to North Texas from Santa Fe, N.M., about 12 hours, in the
heat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ANNA, Texas</DL>
<LD>A tractor-trailer believed to be hauling dozens of Mexican nationals
for several hours in 90-degree heat was found at a truck stop here
Saturday, and police confirmed an unspecified number of fatalities.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses said one man stumbled from the trailer and was
hospitalized. Rescue workers said at least two more people were in
the truck parked in this small town about 40 miles north of Dallas.</LD>
<LD>   It was unclear what had happened to the driver.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities believed it was the same rig that stopped at a Dallas
truck stop earlier, where witnesses said about 40 people poured out,
some fleeing into neighborhoods seeking help.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the truck had traveled to Dallas from Santa Fe,
N.M., about a 12-hour drive. Some ran to homes asking for water, and
the truck left the scene before police arrived.</TE>
<TE>   At least 14 people were hospitalized for heat exhaustion and
possible heat stroke. Authorities said at least five were in critical
condition. It was about 96 degrees Saturday afternoon in the Dallas
area.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas police Sgt. Steve Winters said about 20 people were taken
into custody; others got away and were being sought.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a heartbreaking thing to see people suffering like that,"
said Willie Warren, an employee at the Dallas truck stop. "They were
gagging for breath. Some of them couldn't even walk."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said they tried to help several people.</TE>
<TE>   "They said it was 12 hours from the last time they actually saw
the daylight," saidAlberto Castillo. "You know, 12 hours at this time
of day is hard."</TE>

<HD>Thousands Flock to See Lava Flowing From Kilauea Eruptions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU</DL>
<LD>Glowing lava set trees afire and oozed into the ocean before dawn
Saturday as thousands of spectators braved Kilauea Volcano's scalding
spray to witness the spectacle.</LD>
<LD>   It is considered the most dangerous display of volcanic activity
from Kilauea since 1995. Since the flow began May 12, the lava has
triggered one major fire, which burned more than 3,600 acres.</LD>
<LD>   The Hawaii Volcano Observatory reported that Saturday's lava
breakout crossed the Chain of Craters Road and cascaded into the sea
on the east side of the Big Island.</LD>
<TE>   Although Kilauea has been erupting for nearly 19 years, officials
say up to 2,500 people a day have been flocking to witness the latest
dramatics.</TE>
<TE>   Flights to Hilo International Airport are heavily booked, and car
rental agencies on the Big Island report having few vehicles. Park
rangers say cars stationed along the road a few hundred yards from
the flow have been backed up for two miles.</TE>
<TE>   "Conditions change rapidly," said James Gale, a guide for Volcano
National Park. "It's really very powerful to see something like this
face to face."</TE>
<TE>   Rangers have warned visitors that the volcano can be deadly as the
lava creates acidic and potentially harmful steam plumes and
undermines the lava crust, which can suddenly collapse.</TE>
<TE>   In November 2000, two hikers died after they apparently were
overcome by fumes where the lava enters the sea. In October, a woman
fell to her death in Kilauea's caldera.</TE>
<TE>   Smoke from burning asphalt as lava meets road poses an additional
danger.</TE>
<TE>   "Delighted visitors are sucking up the asphalt smoke," said
Saturday's early report from scientists monitoring the flow.</TE>
<TE>   Rangers hand out cotton gloves to protect against burns and have
been using reflectors to mark the safest path to a view of the fiery
show after dark.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano
Observatory reported seeing a predawn glow Saturday from fires above
the lava flow that "testifies to its presence in the forest."</TE>
<TE>   No buildings or major roadways have been threatened by the latest
phase in Kilauea's long eruption.</TE>
<TE>   A global satellite positioning system is monitoring the broader
rise of the lava for signs of explosions.</TE>
<TE>   Tiltmeters on the lava show whether a dome is rising. A brief
"inflammatory bump" was recorded Friday but was flat by midnight and
remained flat Saturday morning, the scientists said.</TE>
<TE>   Mapping shows a new lobe of lava developing to the east of the
flow, moving at a rate of more than 300 feet a day.</TE>

<HD>Reaction Is Swift, but Does It Run Deep?</HD>
<DH>Fixing the economy will take more than shallow reforms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Our slumbering government has stirred. A few supposed corporate
"perps" have been humiliated and dragged off to face the music. The
president and Congress have lumbered into action, claiming ignorance
and professing wisdom at the same time. So we're feeling better about
the business of business.</LD>
<LD>   And as for the markets? Well, they'll just have to take care of
themselves.</LD>
<LD>   Not so fast.</LD>
<TE>   Even when you're in its stranglehold, history has a propensity to
collapse around itself. Weighty problems boil over day after day, and
the sludge gets reduced to a single idea or phrase, like "corporate
greed" or "Watergate."</TE>
<TE>   That's how society manages information overload. But before we get
too far down this path, we still have time to ask: Have we gotten to
the heart of the problems in our free-enterprise system? Or are we
like the family that finds termites in the house and settles for a
fast coat of paint?</TE>
<TE>   No, I'm not an expert on these matters, but look what a
slaughterhouse mess the experts have made of things. I'm just one of
millions who dread the upcoming quarterly statement on my 401(k), and
I don't think we're getting our money's worth in the payback of
reform.</TE>
<TE>   What bothers me most about the halfhearted response from
Washington is the official supposition, the shared and rigid
ideology, that things are supposed to work this way. Businesses grow
and collapse; stocks go up and down, the unrestrained free market
will take care of our collective interests.</TE>
<TE>   Really? The very best we can devise is an economy that
periodically creates handfuls of winners and millions of losers?</TE>
<TE>   Those house rules might have been acceptable when the markets were
casinos for wealthy elites. But now the rest of us have been dragged
in, with our retirements. Remember, 1% of the population holds almost
40% of the wealth these days. Which leads to this matter of
"executive compensation."</TE>
<TE>   The only way to attract talent is to pay these folks
fortunes--yes, real fortunes. Or so we're told. I guess we're
supposed to believe that they will stay home and pout if they don't
get $100 million?</TE>
<TE>   As I said, I'm no economics theorist. But I know a little about
human nature. It seems pretty clear that the single-minded, and
plainly mindless, competition for money brings out the worst in
people. Yet for all the hot air in Washington, we've heard barely a
peep of protest about those ongoing tax cuts that will benefit these
same income elitists the most--the richest 1% and the rest of the top
fifth of our population, which has already amassed all but 17% of all
the personal wealth in the U.S. For all the talk about reform, the
reigning law of the land means that rich executives can expect only
to get richer.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, but the new threat of prison terms for white-collar crimes
will keep people in line from now on. Well, I'm a law-and-order man
and I'm all for getting tough on criminals. And I'm sure that
finaglers will be more cautious now.</TE>
<TE>   But let's not forget Michael Milken, whose outrages made him one
of the few Wall Street scammers to actually pull prison time after
the last round of business scandals. Since then, he has become a
philanthropist, and I see he's back in the news raking in more money
from a fresh stock offering.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, we can presume that the government's vaunted new
accounting board will get us only so far. I stumble right away on
this matter of stock options, which clearly fueled the fire under a
good number of cooked corporate books.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Congress and the president both have resisted the common-sense
idea that options should show up on the ledger as an expense. They're
too complicated to include in corporate statements, we're told.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, the value of stock options are no more difficult to
calculate than gas mileage. Any option holder in America who couldn't
figure the value in a heartbeat using nothing more than a drug-store
calculator doesn't deserve to receive them. Corporations simply don't
want to disclose these costs because profits will look weaker if they
are more forthright, which I thought was the aim of accounting reform
in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   A cynic would say there is a simple reason that the government
hasn't dug deeper or acted more boldly: Today's politicians are
either part of the wealthy elite or are beholden to them for
political donations.</TE>
<TE>   Oops, wait, I almost forgot. Congress and the president dealt with
that crisis and "reformed" the campaign finance system last March,
didn't they?</TE>

<HD>Bush Should Seek Congress' Backing for a War on Iraq</HD>
<DH>The president would be wise to follow his father's 1990
example.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEREK CHOLLET</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to hold hearings
this week that will begin one of the most important national
dialogues on U.S. foreign policy since the end of the Cold War: How
the Bush administration plans to remove Saddam Hussein from power,
and perhaps even more critical, how it will help Iraq once he is
gone.</LD>
<LD>   Until now, these questions have been confined to policy experts
debating hypothetical scenarios or press speculation fueled by
Pentagon leaks of draft U.S. war plans. Such haphazard debates lack
the seriousness of the task at hand and have done little to address
the concerns of common citizens or key allies. The administration
needs to promote this discussion, not run from it.</LD>
<LD>   The president would be wise to follow the example of his father,
who more than a decade ago faced a similar situation with a public
divided about using military force to confront Hussein.</LD>
<TE>   During the fall of 1990, President Bush the elder decided that he
wanted Congress "to bless what I'm about to do"  and set forth on an
intense lobbying campaign to win support.</TE>
<TE>   Some of his top advisors--including then-Secretary of Defense Dick
Cheney--argued that seeking congressional approval was unnecessary
and too risky, but the president went ahead and gained Congress'
support in a narrow vote.</TE>
<TE>   President George W. Bush should now seek a similar seal of
approval from Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Arlen Specter
submitted a resolution asking for a vote to authorize using force
against Hussein, and President Bush should publicly declare his
support.</TE>
<TE>   By making his case for action now, and having the people's
representatives vote on it, the president will take a major step
toward developing the domestic backing he will need to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   Yet inside the administration, many of Bush's advisors are
offering the same counsel his father overruled 12 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   They say that, legally, Congress does not need to authorize the
use of force and that engaging in such a debate now could undermine
consensus, embolden Bush's critics and give comfort to U.S. enemies.
They fear too the loss of an element of surprise.</TE>
<TE>   Such arguments are not without merit. Putting any policy to an
up-or-down congressional vote is a calculated risk. But there are at
least three good reasons the president must take this gamble.</TE>
<TE>   The first is that a vote's outcome is not really in
question--barring some catastrophe, Congress will support the
president. The question is not whether to act against Hussein, but
when and how.</TE>
<TE>   A congressional debate also would force the administration to
explain its rationale for confronting Hussein now, weigh the options
for doing so and detail how it would help rebuild Iraq once that
nation's leader was gone.</TE>
<TE>   This would show that the U.S. had thought through its actions and
rebut those at home and abroad who caricature Bush as a callow cowboy
who acts without regard to costs or consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, and most urgent, a congressional debate and vote would
help prepare Americans for the long road ahead. This means bracing
people for the immediate costs of conflict, including possible U.S.
casualties. And it means preparing Americans for their
responsibilities after Hussein is gone.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, while the U.S. has many military and covert tools
to defeat Hussein, it has far fewer resources to build what comes
next.</TE>
<TE>   Although President Bush plans to add $15 billion to the U.S.
foreign assistance budget over the next three years, this is not even
enough to fulfill our current responsibilities, let alone a massive
reconstruction effort in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the potential sacrifices that Americans would be asked
to make in a campaign against Iraq, they deserve to be better
informed. And Congress deserves an opportunity to vote on it.</TE>

<HD>Bid for Immunizations Suggests a Drug Maker's Unhealthy
Focus on Latinos</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most political analysts, myself included, see the growing clout of
Latinos in the Legislature--19 of 80 Assembly members and seven of 40
state senators--as a good thing. It symbolizes the emergence of a
group that has often been marginalized in California's history.</LD>
<LD>   But this newfound Latino power can have downsides. It can provide
a tempting target for lobbyists looking for a knee-jerk bloc vote for
schemes that can be sold as a way to help the state's fast-growing
Latino population.</LD>
<LD>   I can't shake the feeling that this is what's happening with a
worrisome Assembly bill awaiting action by the state Senate. AB 915,
by Assemblyman Dario Frommer (D-Los Feliz), was introduced at the
request of a liberal advocacy group called the Latino Issues Forum.
It would require schoolchildren to be immunized against hepatitis A
in order to attend school. But not all children in California; only
those in the six southernmost counties, including Los Angeles, Orange
and San Diego.</LD>
<TE>   The bill's aim, as its sponsors admit, is to target communities
with lots of Latino schoolchildren in the hope of stemming an
"epidemic" of hepatitis A among Latino kids.</TE>
<TE>   I qualify the word "epidemic" because public health experts
disagree as to whether the incidence of hepatitis A among Latinos is
of epidemic proportions or not. Backers of the bill cite a study by
the Center for the Study of Latino Health &amp; Culture at UCLA that
concludes there is an epidemic. But the state Department of Health
Services is dubious, citing a recent drop in hepatitis A as measured
by the public-health statistics it gathers. DHS believes the decline
may obviate the need for mandatory immunizations.</TE>
<TE>   When experts disagree, especially in a sensitive and complex area
like public health, the smart thing for nonexperts to do is await
more information.</TE>
<TE>   But AB 915 is rolling along. It is scheduled for a hearing before
the Senate Health and Human Services Committee on Aug. 5.</TE>
<TE>   This is where the lobbyists pushing the bill come in. Most have
links to the drug company Glaxo- SmithKline, one of two firms (Merck
&amp; Co. is the other) licensed to manufacture the vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   GlaxoSmithKline paid $50,000 for the UCLA study being used to
justify AB 915. The GlaxoSmithKline executive who arranged for the
study, Gaspar Laca, happens to be vice president of the Latino Issues
Forum board. The drug company also gave the forum $20,000 to
underwrite a health issues conference where the hepatitis A
"epidemic" was one of the topics.</TE>
<TE>   But most interesting of all is a recent report in the Sacramento
Bee, which found that GlaxoSmithKline had donated nearly $235,000
this year to dozens of legislators from both political parties.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those contributions are to members of the Assembly and
Senate committees that deal with health issues, which is no great
surprise. But how does one explain the many donations to incumbent
Latino legislators, regardless of their committee memberships? Just
over 100 donations to individual legislators are listed in
GlaxoSmithKline's most recent campaign donations report, and 52 are
to Latino legislators. Only 12 of the Legislature's 26 Latino members
sit on health-related committees. This pattern of political donations
doesn't pass my smell test.</TE>
<TE>   Is GlaxoSmithKline's interest in Latino legislators a matter of
public health or good marketing? Laca of GlaxoSmithKline says his
concern was to focus attention on a Latino public health problem that
might otherwise be overlooked by policymakers. Yet this wouldn't be
the first time a major drug company had targeted Latinos. And the
precedent is scary.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, my Times colleague David Willman followed up on his
series about the dangerous diabetes drug Rezulin. Among the new
documents he uncovered were marketing plans by the drug's
manufacturer, Warner-Lambert, that laid out a campaign to get doctors
with predominantly Latino patients "to take the risk" of prescribing
what has proved to be--in hundreds of cases--a fatal drug.</TE>
<TE>   The experience with Rezulin is reason enough that state
legislators, regardless of ethnic background, should be extra careful
before voting public-health mandates into law. Listen to the experts,
and don't rush to judgment.</TE>

<HD>Talking With N. Korea: It's Worth a Try</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEONGHO SHEEN and TOSHI YOSHIHARA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This week, the foreign ministers from more than 20 nations, including
the United States, will gather in Brunei to discuss security issues
in the Asia-Pacific region. But an informal meeting there between
U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and North Korean Foreign
Minister Paek Nam Sun may prove more important. If it happens, it
will be the first bilateral contact by high-level officials of the
U.S. and North Korea in nearly two years.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, if recent history is any guide, this overture
between the U.S. and North Korea will probably be another round of a
cat-and-mouse game in which the North offers, then retracts, promises
to revive talks.</LD>
<LD>   Only last month, the North opened fire on two South Korean patrol
boats, killing five sailors. The Bush administration four days later
withdrew an offer to resume talks with Pyongyang. Indeed, there is no
guarantee that Paek will even show up in Brunei.</LD>
<TE>   The basic conflicts between the two nations remain immense:
curbing North Korea's military aspirations by, among other things,
inducing it to cut back its nuclear weapons program; improving
relations between the two Koreas; and taking tentative steps toward
rapprochement between the U.S. and North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   There has been much carping from critics about the
administration's so-called hard-line policy toward North Korea. For
example, Wendy Sherman, Bill Clinton's point person on North Korea,
recently said, "We are at risk of losing any momentum for change we
might have once had and turning cloudy skies into a fierce storm."</TE>
<TE>   Such critics claim that President Bush has forced Pyongyang into a
corner and that the administration has undermined the South's
engagement efforts with the North.</TE>
<TE>   They argue that the Bush administration's stance of resolving all
items on the negotiating table--including weapons of mass destruction
and missile proliferation, conventional arms reduction, human rights
and inspections of nuclear facilities--is unrealistically burdensome.
And there were howls of protest when Bush singled out North Korea
(along with Iraq and Iran) as part of an "axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>   However, the Bush policy toward North Korea, centering on the
principles of verifiability and reciprocity, is more comprehensive,
more complex, more nuanced--and potentially more effective--than
critics acknowledge.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials have suggested that the U.S. will be more
flexible in reaching agreement on agenda items. As early as June
2001, the administration spearheaded a diplomatic initiative to bring
the North back to the negotiating table, with the president declaring
that Washington was ready to talk "any time, anyplace, without
preconditions."</TE>
<TE>   During his visit to South Korea in February, Bush reiterated his
support for Seoul's "sunshine policy," the effort intended to bring
about reconciliation with the North. Further, the U.S. has continued
to deliver food aid to the North. Yet the administration also is
aware that conciliatory gestures have their limits.</TE>
<TE>   Pyongyang still refuses to allow inspectors from the International
Atomic Energy Agency into the country to make a full accounting of
its past nuclear activities. Even with its economy a shambles, North
Korea spends 25% of its gross national product on defense. This while
its health system has collapsed and millions of its people face
starvation and death.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea remains fundamentally what it has been: erratic,
hostile and dangerous, as well as a threat to South Korea and Japan.</TE>
<TE>   So should Powell even bother to meet with Paek in Brunei? It's
worth a try.</TE>
<TE>   Pyongyang on Thursday belatedly broadcast a message to South Korea
expressing "regret" for last month's naval clash, and it proposed
resuming a dialogue with Seoul. A small gesture, but one that could
augur well for a meeting between Powell and Paek.</TE>
<TE>   As Winston Churchill said in 1954, "To jaw-jaw is always better
than to war-war."</TE>
<TE>   With Pyongyang, one can only hope.</TE>

<HD>Blue Danube</HD>
<DH>PRAGUE: A Novel, By Arthur Phillips, Random House: 374 pp.,
$24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELLER McALPIN</AU>
<BD>Heller McAlpin is a writer whose reviews have appeared
in the San Francisco Chronicle, the Washington Post and the Christian
Science Monitor, among other publications.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hemingway and Fitzgerald wrote about the Lost Generation of Americans
who flocked to Paris after World War I, pursuing stimulation beyond
the bland boundaries of Middle America. In "Prague," Arthur Phillips
focuses on a new "lost generation" seeking financial and personal
fulfillment in post-communist Eastern Europe. His young
English-speaking expatriates land not in picture-perfect "cash
lavished" Prague but in Budapest, "this God-forsaken paprika-stained
Austrian test-market," also known, more flatteringly, as "Paris on
the Danube."</LD>
<TE>   Phillips' novel has scope, historical perspective and complexity,
especially rare in many first novels. His characters, who beach in
"plucky, unlucky Hungary" in 1990, just one year after the collapse
of the Berlin Wall, are more strivers than drifters and more jaded
and cynical than their earlier Parisan counterparts. They are members
of the "triumphant generation" who won the Cold War. They dream of
glistening, beckoning Prague but remain in Budapest, where they are
"the occupying army, benevolent, offering our vanquished erstwhile
foe an open hand and a fresh start, smart investment opportunities,
top-notch language instruction, and a whole generation of
neo-retro-hippies, bad artists, and club kids." They do this against
Phillips' vividly evoked backdrop of a bullet-pocked country with a
century's worth of hardships that are essentially unfathomable to
most Americans.</TE>
<TE>   In a novel filled with clever riffs, one of the most deft is
Phillips' opening number. He introduces his five main characters with
a game they play in local cafes and bars. In four rounds, players
take turns attempting to mislead one another with sincere-sounding
personal assertions. Of the four statements each player makes, only
one may be true. Phillips manages to convey volumes about his
characters through their dissemblings. "Sincerity" is the brainchild
of the group's pivotal member, Charles (ne Karoly) Gabor, the son of
Hungarians who fled Budapest in 1956 for Ohio. Ruthless, bilingual
Charles has returned to Hungary with his MBA to snake out investment
deals. "Sincerity" is a con game, and Charles is a master. At the
other end of the spectrum, Emily Oliver, an embassy assistant, is an
upbeat, self-disciplined Nebraskan who, it seems, cannot lie. (Of
course, it turns out she's the real pro.) Mark Payton is a gay
Canadian postdoc researching a history of nostalgia based on his
dissertation. He becomes increasingly unhinged by his immersion in
the past and his efforts to reconcile past, present and future.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the group are Scott Price and his younger brother
John, who, to Scott's horror, has followed him to Budapest. John
hopes to establish a rapport with his unfriendly sibling, but Scott
is bitter over what he perceives as their parent's preference for
John. Scott is a formerly obese, now buff health nut who teaches
English and ends up marrying one of his students. His opening gambit,
patently false to all who know him: "I'm really glad John tracked me
down here in Budapest." Phillips repeatedly frustrates our
expectations for a grand epiphany, revealing the root of the
brothers' animosity, preferring a more subtle leakage of information.
This is an author who doesn't feel compelled to cross every T.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Scott's rebuff, John settles into a dingy sublet on one of
Pest's many re-renamed streets. He lands a job at an English-language
paper, BudapesToday, writing an edgy, opinionated column about
Budapest's fin de siecle scene, which allows Phillips to soapbox in a
different voice. John also quickly breaks the chastity vow he imposed
upon himself after his parents' adultery-damaged marriage and his
reading convinced him that "[s]ex turns men into idiots and should be
avoided." One of Phillips' funnier set pieces is John's adolescent
journal of lessons gleaned from literature. An entry at age 15 reads,
"It's better to die, even to die slowly, than to get married ('War
and Peace')." While yearning hopelessly for Emily, John falls into
multiple couplings, including one with a viciously ambitious collage
artist and "fratultery" with his brother's girlfriend, soon to be
wife.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips, a Harvard graduate, five-time "Jeopardy!" champion and
former jazz musician, born in Minneapolis, flexes his brainy biceps
without flaunting them unduly. However, he's not above some
compulsively clever wordplay. One sentence juxtaposes "weekly coifed"
with "weakly coughed," another "Rambo" with "Rimbaud." His portrait
of Hungary, triple loser of World War II, is heartbreaking. He cuts
restlessly between stories, often paragraph by paragraph--as if
trying to capture Robert Altman's overlapping simultaneity and
Bertolt Brecht's alienation technique on the page--but the result is
often self-consciously cinematic and choppy. Whit Stillman's movie
"Barcelona" and Milan Kundera's novels are more direct influences.</TE>
<TE>   Readers may at first wonder where Phillips is going with a long
digression on the fictional Horvath Press. With his Horvath family
saga, Phillips encapsulates Hungary's tragic history from 1808
through the 20th century, climaxing with a mock MBA case study exam
that asks students to map a solvent future for the politically
beleaguered company, a masterpiece of caustic satire that resonates
with another plot line: Charles, the hotshot MBA, conniving to
privatize and sell the Horvath business.</TE>
<TE>   In relaying the hardships suffered by his Hungarian characters,
Phillips provides a pointed contrast to his disaffected Americans.
Phillips, who lived in Budapest from 1990 to 1992 and now lives in
Paris, shows an expatriate's ability to see his fellow Americans from
a critical distance. The result is a substantive book that braves the
cliches of expat ennui to consider such issues as sincerity, scruples
and the vicissitudes of history.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `Prague'</TE>
<TE>   Who won the Cold War? We did. Our generation. Our sacrifices broke
the Communist behemoth. Yes, granted, okay: Our parents lived through
the flickering black-and-white footage days of the Cuban missile
crisis and Vietnam. But those of us born under Johnson, Nixon and
Ford--we are the triumphant generation. We faced Armageddon from
birth; we never knew any other way but mutually assured destruction,
and we never blinked. We came of age staring down Brezhnev, Andropov,
Chernenko, Ustinov. We were inured to their stony silences, wrinkly
faces, and short reigns. When Gorbachev peered out from his Kremlin
bunker, what did he see? He saw us entering college, pretty much
willing to make do with slightly smaller student loans in order to
fund Star Wars, doing what had to be done, voting for Reagan.</TE>

<HD>For Someone Who's No Fan of the Show, Peter Gabriel Has a
Very 'Brady' Moment</HD>

<LD>What has Peter Gabriel been doing in the 10 years since he last
released a studio album of new songs, watching "The Brady Bunch"
reruns on Nick at Nite?</LD>
<LD>   A song on Gabriel's long-awaited next album, "Up," is titled "The
Barry Williams Show." Barry Williams is, of course, the actor who
played eldest son Greg Brady on the '70s sitcom. He's also remained a
TV presence lately on shows ranging from "S Club 7" (the popular U.K.
teen group's series, in which he plays the manager) to Fox's
"Celebrity Boxing" (he battled Danny Bonaduce of Brady rival "The
Partridge Family" and now serves as an interviewer and talent
consultant). And Williams is currently touring as opening act for
Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees.</LD>
<LD>   Gabriel says the song is an indictment of what he refers to as "TV
culture." And while Williams is proud to be part of TV culture, he
wondered, upon first hearing about it, why he'd been singled out.</LD>
<TE>   Turns out he hadn't.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't realize at the time of choosing the name Barry Williams,
which was effectively out of a hat, that there would be various
well-known Barry Williamses," Gabriel explains, noting that there
also is a Welsh rugby player with the name.</TE>
<TE>   He says he was not very familiar with "The Brady Bunch," and that
his tastes in American television run to the animated satire of "Dr.
Katz" and "The Simpsons."</TE>
<TE>   "I was only made aware of the 'Brady Bunch' connection when
Richard Chappell, my engineer, found some discussion about it on a
fan Web site," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, fans participating on Gabriel's official Web site,
www.petergabriel.com, have been debating the title reference,
wondering if there was a connection. The Barry Williams of the song
is closer to Jerry Springer than to Greg Brady, hosting a reality
talk show geared to sensationalism with such themes as, per the
song's lyrics, "My lover stole my girlfriend" and "I love my
daughter's rapist."</TE>
<TE>   Unaware that the lyrics weren't a reference to him, actor Williams
says that at first "I didn't get it." But reading further and hearing
Gabriel's explanation, he was merely amused at the coincidence.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it's just an English name," he says. "Or maybe I'm
becoming so well known that I'm invading the subconscious of
different people."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the coincidence, Gabriel says he has "no qualms at
all" about any connotations the name may have for fans. With the song
slated to be the first single from "Up," due in stores Sept. 24, he's
more than happy to capitalize on the name recognition factor.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hoping to find a name that might fit comfortably in a
reality TV show," Gabriel says.</TE>
<TE>   Says Williams, noting the musician's vaunted history with music
videos, "After all, [Gabriel] has certainly used television to his
advantage before."</TE>
<TE>   HELPING FEATS: Billy Bob Thornton will be giving up a prized
motorcycle soon--but it's not part of the settlement of his pending
divorce from Angelina Jolie. He's donating it to an Internet auction
raising money to help with the medical and rehabilitation needs of
Severn Hayward, the 19-year-old son of Little Feat drummer Richie
Hayward. Severn was severely brain-injured in a December car crash
and remains partially paralyzed. He has not regained full motor or
speech faculties.</TE>
<TE>   Thornton's bike, the Duke, is a street-legal KTM 620 cc,
four-stroke model (for those who understand motorcycle talk). It will
be available for bidding on the band's Web site (www.faerae.com/feat)
beginning in mid-September. No starting price has been set.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Hayward has donated a drum set, and other items up for
bid include a Fender Stratocaster autographed by members of the
Doobie Brothers, a travel package to a Little Feat show in Washington
in October, and original art by Little Feat cover designer Neon Park
and his wife, filmmaker Chick Strand. Other friends of the band
donating items include Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, Van Dyke Parks,
Wavy Gravy and Carlos Santana.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Moore, who oversees the Little Feat Web site, says the goal
is to raise $100,000 to put in a trust that has been set up for
Severn.</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Daniel Lanois, focusing on his own music after
producing U2, Bob Dylan and others, has signed a deal for a new album
with the Anti label, the Epitaph Records wing that has recently
released acclaimed sets by Tom Waits and Merle Haggard. Lanois' first
solo album in nine years is scheduled for January, with several of
his star production clients expected to contribute vocals. A spring
tour, including a show at New York's Carnegie Hall, will follow ....</TE>
<TE>   Everclear has finished a new album, "Slow Motion Daydream," due
from Capitol in October ....</TE>
<TE>   Former Hole drummer Patty Schemel and her brother, former
Flesheaters guitarist Larry Schemel, have both joined Lucid Nation, a
band fronted by singer Tamra Spivey and featuring bassist Greta
Brinkman of Moby's live band. The group has finished an album,
"Tacoma Ballet," due in September ....</TE>
<TE>   Members of English world-techno group Loop Guru and drummer Rat
Scabies of the Damned have teamed up under the band name Slipper,
with an album, "Zoon Sandwich," due Aug. 27. The album was recorded
with the individual musicians never being in the same room at the
same time. Each did his parts independently and sent them to the
others via e-mail....</TE>
<TE>   Among the releases marking the 25th anniversary of Elvis Presley's
death on Aug. 16, 1977, will be an eight-DVD set, "The Definitive
Elvis," from Passport International Productions featuring 16 hourlong
episodes built around interviews with more than 200 Presley friends
and insiders. It's due Aug. 13. That's also the day Rhino Home Video
issues "Elvis: The Great Performances," a three-volume set with more
than 40 concert, movie and television performances plus interview and
other footage. The Rhino box, naturally, will be packaged in blue
suede.</TE>

<HD>Seriously, Dude</HD>
<DH>Trying to compete with the allure of the beach, a Laguna
museum mounts a show on the art of surf culture</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every year around this time, in between their usual encounters with
truth, beauty, scholarship and donor-cultivation, the museum
directors of North America can be seen facing another humbling
challenge: How can their indoor spaces compete with the great
outdoors on a sunny summer day?</LD>
<LD>   The answer this year, if you're the Laguna Art Museum, is to
paddle with the prevailing tide. That is, to mount a show on the
cultural implications of surfing. Beginning today, the museum is
doing just that and betting heavily that it will draw visitors far
beyond its usual audience.</LD>
<LD>   During the run of "Surf Culture: The Art History of Surfing,"
through Oct. 6, the Laguna museum will stay open seven days a week
instead of six, will operate from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. instead of 11 to
5, and will bump its adult admission fee from $5 to $7.</LD>
<TE>   If all goes as planned, the museum will match its previous record
attendance for a single show, which is about 6,000 paid admissions
(or 12,000 visitors, if museum members and school groups are
included). On the other hand, if prospective visitors decide they
would rather admire the genuine article--the surf itself, which foams
and laps about 300 feet from the museum door--the curators are
doomed.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, the record will show that this was the summer that
museum director Bolton Colburn and his team took a plunge. Drawing on
major sponsorship from surfwear manufacturer Quiksilver, the small
museum is emptying its 10,000-square-foot space, then filling it with
90 surfboards, two automobiles, two dozen oversized and
weapon-bearing hula-dancer dolls, about 40 paintings, and more than
150 photographs and other objects. The museum is also publishing a
240-page companion book featuring essays along with reproductions of
artworks and artifacts.</TE>
<TE>   "We're interested in ideas that are brought about by surfing and
notions that arise in someone's head when they see someone surfing,"
Colburn said recently, as boxed and swaddled art and artifacts
accumulated in the museum's closed galleries. The crux of the show,
Colburn said, is locating those points where the worlds of art and
surfing overlap.</TE>
<TE>   Among the ideas in play: the evolution of surfboard design during
the last century (they got shorter and lighter); the economic impact
of surf-inspired fashions (growing); the permutations of surf kitsch
(myriad); and the many artists who have appropriated surfboard forms
and materials (like polyurethane), which were themselves appropriated
from the aerospace industry in the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   If it's beginning to sound like the museum is burying this sunny
subject in sober scholarship, consider the opening words of the
companion essay contributed by University of Hawaii anthropology
professor Ben Finney:</TE>
<TE>   "During the summer of 1952, while working as a lifeguard in San
Diego...."</TE>
<TE>   Artists represented include Craig Kauffman, Billy Al Bengston,
Robert Irwin and Sandow Birk, and many works tend toward the playful
and deceptive. Under the first category comes Birk (a surfer and son
of Seal Beach), whose 1999 painting "North Swell (Washington Crossing
the Delaware)" shows a flotilla of wet-suited surfers, arranged to
echo the famous Emanuel Leutze painting of George Washington and
company heroically paddling.</TE>
<TE>   In the deceptive category is "Aloha Oe," a collection of motorized
hula dolls made of cast resin by artist Kevin Ansell two years ago.
The dolls, which were part of a summer 2000 Surf Trip show staged at
San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (and later that year
at Track 16 Gallery in Santa Monica's Bergamot Station), wear grass
skirts and bikini tops like the usual dashboard-dwelling hula girls,
but stand life-sized and carry guns, grenades and other weapons of
revenge. A closer look reveals bruises around their eyes and needle
tracks on their arms--hints, writes curator Tyler Stallings, of
Yankee imperialism and the erosion of indigenous cultures.</TE>
<TE>   Competing with the beach has never been easy for California
museums, although, as artists and curators admit, it has occasionally
been fun.</TE>
<TE>   At the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, for instance, the
museum's Krichman Gallery has long been problematic for curators
because it's so pretty to begin with: It's dominated by windows with
a postcard view of La Jolla's coastline. And so in 1999, museum
director Hugh Davies invited artist Robert Irwin to create a
site-specific work there.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin responded with an installation called "1nternational 2nternational 3nternational 4nternational,"
removing three rectangles of glass, two from corner windows and one
from the central window. The idea was to violate the line between
interior and exterior, to bring outdoor sounds, smells and other
sensations into the spare, subdued space of the museum. But another
factor, Davies said, was that Irwin was fed up with people walking
into that gallery, pointing to that window and exclaiming, "Now
there's the real art."</TE>
<TE>   The beach, said Meg Linton, executive director of the Santa
Barbara Contemporary Art Forum, "isn't just summer competition. It's
competition all year round for us. It's difficult. In New York, you
go to museums to be warm during winter, and then you go to museums to
be cool during summer."</TE>
<TE>   Author and critic Peter Plagens takes this idea and sprints with
it in "Sunshine Muse," his 1974 history of West Coast art from 1945
to 1970. One of art's principal roles, he says, is to "mitigate urban
ugliness. America's greatest art center (New York) has been ugliest
longest; Los Angeles' most important art appeared (1962-68) only
after the city suffused itself in smog and trash architecture."</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, taking into account the way Santa Barbara looks most
of the year, the Contemporary Arts Forum uses summery strategies all
year long. In 1998, the forum did a skateboard design show,
"Skatelore Expo," that was so popular with younger audiences, Linton
said, that "when I first got here in 1999, there were still kids
coming up and asking where the skateboards were."</TE>
<TE>   In summer 2000, the exhibition space took another tack in bringing
the Southern California landscape indoors. In "Dustin Shuler Targets
Transportation," the forum presented a Los Angeles artist's vision of
the freeway system as a modern Serengeti, its vehicles as beasts. The
show included such artifacts as the hanging pelt of a Volkswagen bus,
parts of a small plane nailed to a wall and a Cadillac fin sculpture.
Writing in The Times, critic David Pagel dismissed the show as "more
a souvenir stand than an art exhibition," but it drew more than 4,000
visitors to the smallish space in eight weeks--by the forum's
standards, a blockbuster.</TE>
<TE>   For the Laguna museum, "The Art History of Surfing" represents an
accumulation of influences. The clues begin with director Colburn,
who was raised in California and educated at UC San Diego, and won a
national amateur surfing competition in 1977 at age 22. He came to
the Laguna museum as a curator in 1989 and became its director in
1996.</TE>
<TE>   But even before Colburn became director, the Laguna museum had a
reputation for taking pop culture seriously. One of the institution's
best-remembered and most-praised shows during the last decade is its
1993 "Kustom Kulture" exhibition on Southern California car
customizers. In fact, Colburn confesses, the surfing exhibition was
conceived as a sibling to the car-culture show, then delayed as other
projects popped up and the difficulties of assembling a worthwhile
surf show became clear.</TE>
<TE>   "If you grew up here or were going to school here, the two things
that may have affected you, in terms of culture, are the surf culture
and the car culture," Colburn said. "It's a little bit different than
growing up someplace else."</TE>
<TE>   Besides Colburn and curator Stallings (who was the museum's former
curator of exhibitions when preparation of the show began but has
left the museum), the surf show's collaborators include guest curator
Craig Stecyk (who co-wrote and co-starred in "Dogtown and Z-Boys," a
2001 film about rebel skateboarders in 1970s Venice Beach);
anthropologist Jacqueline Bryant; graphic designer David Carson
(another erstwhile surfer whose credits include Raygun and Beach
Culture magazines, along with several books); and essayists Finney
and Deanne Stillman (whose lively profile of the original Gidget
reveals that the first female surfer in the public consciousness was
really a nice Jewish girl who grew up to marry a Yiddish scholar and
college dean).</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition is scheduled to travel to the Contemporary Museum
of Honolulu in January 2003 and the San Jose Museum of Art in August
2003. Colburn said he's still looking for other possible venues.</TE>
<TE>   With its companion book, extended hours and inflated price, the
Laguna surf show is expected to cost about $120,000. That puts the
show among the costliest produced by the museum, which counts about
1,800 members and about 30,000 visitors yearly.</TE>
<TE>   But even so, says Colburn, the curators realized early on that
their ambitions were too broad. As a result, they backed away from
ideas of tracing the history of surfing and its sociological context,
Colburn said. After all, California has half a dozen institutions
devoted to straight-ahead surfing history, including the
International Surfing Museum just up the coast in Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Laguna show's mission became an exploration of how
surfing's image evolved and how surfing fashions, materials and ethos
found their way into art and society at large.</TE>
<TE>   The oldest piece in the show is from the days of Captain Cook in
the Hawaiian Islands: a 1784 sailor's etching of surfers, borrowed
from private collector Dan Pincetich of Sun Valley, Idaho. The 90
surfboards, which will mark a path through the show like vertebrae in
a spine, have been borrowed from three dozen private collectors,
mostly in California.</TE>
<TE>   The show also notes an art-surf overlap with particular Southern
California resonance: In May 1968, Andy Warhol and his band of film
collaborators came west and made "San Diego Surf," a film about
surfers in La Jolla. But Warhol was shot and nearly killed the
following month, and the film, his last, was never released. A
22-minute documentary, "Andy Makes a Movie," tells the tale, and on
Aug. 11, the Laguna museum's Surf Culture Lecture Series will feature
veterans of the La Jolla shoot, including filmmakers Robert Smith and
Aaron Sloan.</TE>
<TE>   As for artifacts of surfing's commercial culture, there are
plenty, from logos to advertisements. Although surfwear maker
Quiksilver's name is atop the list of sponsors, Colburn is quick to
note that "we certainly didn't want their influence on the curatorial
part of the show. They were not involved in any way in that." The
show includes advertising images from Quiksilver as well as Gotcha,
another surfwear maker, and Gucci, neither of which are sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   With so much tempting material floating around in pop culture,
Colburn acknowledges, it's been a challenge to keep the show from
lapsing into a big bunch of unorganized neat stuff.</TE>
<TE>   "The subject is immense, a lot more immense than we'd thought it
was going to be," Colburn said. "I know that this isn't the end-all
and be-all of exhibitions like this. But I hope it opens people up.
This is the first time a lot of beach-lifestyle people will be
introduced to a museum, and we want to give them a reason to come
back."</TE>

<LD>Industrial plants can kill. Leaks occasionally lead to neighborhood
disease clusters. (Remember Erin Brockovich's crusade in the
California desert town of Hinkley?) Renegade chemical plumes can
choke to death hundreds or even thousands of people in surrounding
homes. (Remember the methyl isocyanate disaster in Bhopal, India?)</LD>
<LD>   So who should know about the chemicals these plants contain? The
government? The public? Osama bin Laden?</LD>
<LD>   These days, sadly, such questions resonate with a bigger one:
Where do we draw the lines between security and liberty, now that
large-scale terrorism has reached the United States?</LD>
<TE>   Last week, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee
approved a bill by Sens. Jon Corzine (D-N.J.) and James M. Jeffords
(I-Vt.) to guard the nation against chemical terrorism. People don't
normally think of plants that, say, treat drinking water, clean waste
water or refrigerate food as national security risks. They should.</TE>
<TE>   California has 155 such plants, each storing more than 100,000
pounds of chemicals such as chlorine, hydrochloric acid or ammonia
that the Environmental Protection Agency has listed as extremely
hazardous.</TE>
<TE>   Homeland Security chief Tom Ridge recently reminded Congress that
the EPA had identified 123 plants in the country that, in a serious
explosion, could harm at least a million nearby residents. An
additional 1,000 plants could each endanger 100,000 people if toxic
fumes were to waft across the landscape.</TE>
<TE>   The chemical security bill, now in the hands of the full Senate,
would identify the plants that posed the greatest danger, require
them to assess their vulnerability to terrorist attack using a
step-by-step protocol devised by the American Chemical Council,
compel them to hire guards or in other ways improve security and
require that a basic outline of their risk assessments be made
public.</TE>
<TE>   This last bit could spell the bill's doom. The industry, which has
voluntarily been conducting security assessments and making
improvements since January, has always been loath to tell people much
about the concoctions cooking at its plants. And some lawmakers,
including Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), are all too eager to use
the umbrella rationale of terrorist threat to justify further erosion
of the public's right to know.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Corzine accepted a reasonable amendment to his bill,
requiring plants to publicly disclose general information about which
toxic chemicals they store and how they plan to protect them. It also
allows them to keep private specific details about, for example,
which gate a cadre of extremists might use to breach security.</TE>
<TE>   This sort of sensible fine-tuning of the balance between security
imperatives and democratic freedoms--in this case, a plant's interest
in avoiding sabotage versus people's right to the information that
would let them lobby for environmental safeguards--has become more
complex and critical in the age of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   To make sure this well-balanced bill isn't killed or gutted, we
encourage Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) to append it,
as is, to the homeland security legislation Congress is expected to
pass next month.</TE>

<LD>Yes, it felt good to see cable mogul John Rigas, two of his sons and
two other former Adelphia company executives marched off in handcuffs
Wednesday. But what exactly was the point?</LD>
<LD>   Was stripping the 77-year-old Adelphia Communications founder of
his necktie and belt and parading him before the television cameras
in New York supposed to signal that President Bush is serious about
going after corporate accounting fraud? A far better demonstration
would be for him to sign a tough, loophole-free reform bill.</LD>
<LD>   The "Dragnet"-style arrest of the Adelphia Five was an abuse of
discretion and a waste of taxpayer money. It was as tawdry as the Los
Angeles County district attorney's decision this month to make a
spectacle of the arrest--for outstanding warrants--of the guy who
videotaped an Inglewood police officer beating a 16-year-old boy.</LD>
<TE>   The Rigases and the other Adelphia executives are charged with
several counts of securities, wire and bank fraud. The 68-page
criminal complaint details shenanigans such as using corporate funds
to start construction of a $50-million golf course on family land,
buy luxury condominiums, maintain a fleet of private jets and take an
African safari.</TE>
<TE>   Such wretched excess allegedly helped push the company into
bankruptcy. If the five executives are found guilty of fraud, they'll
surely soon be cooling their heels in a cell.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the made-for-prime-time arrests rankle. The Rigases had
offered to turn themselves in, and no one has claimed they posed a
flight risk or a danger to the community--the criteria that
prosecutors normally use in deciding whether to send out the posse.
In fact, federal agents have allowed some pretty notorious felons to
surrender themselves. John Gotti Jr., a reputed boss of the Gambino
crime family, in 1998, and Vincent "The Chin" Gigante, head of the
Genovese crime family, in 1997, are just two.</TE>
<TE>   The criminal justice system should not be used to make a political
statement or to make the public "feel good." And an arrest, no matter
how satisfying, is certainly no substitute for meaningful legislative
reform.</TE>

<LD>We don't hear much about perseverance these days--that is, pursuing
something a long, long time despite serious difficulty or obstacles.
Perseverance is a long word from a long-gone pre-fax era when ice was
delivered by horse-drawn wagons, girls were named Prudence and
Patience and apprenticeships lasted years. Today, everything must be
quick, instant or almost--foods, messages, news, victory, sinus
relief. Today, the finish line gets the attention, not the trip to it
or preparation for it.</LD>
<LD>   So it's been refreshing, at least from an armchair, to follow the
Tour de France bicycle race this month, more particularly to remind
ourselves of a certain personal perseverance within that competition.
Now, that's an endurance race--three weeks and more than 2,000 miles
of bike racing--day after day across heated plains and up and down
chilled, wet mountains. Americans are being exposed more to sports
valued by the rest of the world, in part because Americans are doing
better in competitions like the World Cup. There's an impressive
American in the Tour too--Lance Armstrong, of course.</LD>
<TE>   He used to be an impulsive, erratic individual racer who couldn't
finish three Tours in the '90s. Then, in 1996, he coughed blood and
began a different kind of endurance contest--against advanced
testicular cancer. After it spread, brain surgery. Four rounds of
chemotherapy. He tried a cycling comeback--and quit. He tried again.
And tried again.</TE>
<TE>   But we're not talking about just beating cancer or winning three
consecutive Tours de France, which he's done. We're talking about
enduring--the long, nauseating days of treatments, the long recovery,
the long rebuilding of muscles and the long, lonely training rides in
the Texas sun and deciding, day after day after day, to persist.</TE>
<TE>   You know how your pedaling legs burned, going up that modest hill
last weekend with your youngster? The normal Interstate hill is a 2%
grade, up 2 feet for each 100 feet of road. Here's one recent workday
for Armstrong: A 111-mile bike ride including a 21-mile climb at a
4.7% grade, an 11-mile climb at 6.9% and a 12-mile climb at 7.9%.
Armstrong's average speed: almost 20 miles an hour. Uphill. Never
mind the finishing. Picture the perseverance to endure the physical
and mental preparation to excel in that kind of competition. Even if
you love it.</TE>
<TE>   So today if, as expected, Armstrong becomes the first American and
only the fourth man to win four Tours in a row, he'll step up on the
Paris podium, the cameras will click and the celebration and joy will
be instantaneous. Even if Armstrong doesn't win, we've decided to
remember instead, as best we can conjure up in our imagination, not
that he's up there but how he got up there.</TE>
<TE>   That's the inspiring, modern lesson in old-fashioned perseverance.
And we intend to persevere with this memory for at least a year.</TE>

<HD>Unfunded Growth in Community Colleges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a Los Angeles Community College District trustee, it pains me to
turn away students from our nine campuses. It is difficult to watch
community colleges across California do the same. But we are learning
a lesson in economics and politics. As The Times accurately reported
in "Tough Times Force Cuts at 2-Year Colleges" (July 22), the
community college district is facing financial challenges that are
forcing us to limit enrollment and reduce classes.</LD>
<LD>   The LACCD is the best post-secondary education deal in California,
and our growing enrollment is proof of that. But our burgeoning
enrollment is also our biggest challenge. In Los Angeles, the
critical issue is "unfunded growth." This last year, the LACCD
enrollment grew 10%, but the district received only a 3% increase in
state funding. This meant that the Los Angeles Community College
District served 14,000 full-time-equivalent students, or about 22,000
actual students, whom we didn't get funding for.</LD>
<LD>   The campus budgets absorbed this cost, but the saturation point
has been reached and surpassed. This problem is compounded because
community colleges get funded less per student than any other level
of higher education.</LD>
<TE>   The LACCD educates more than four times as many African Americans
and three times as many Latinos as the University of California
system. In order to maintain the Los Angeles community colleges'
status as "gateways to opportunity," the state must adjust its
funding formulas and address the critical problem of unfunded growth.
We cannot slam the door on people who want to learn and throw them
into a society that demands college diplomas to succeed.</TE>

<HD>Middle East Leaders Defer to Extremism</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It was encouraging to read Hussein Ibish's straightforward and
evenhanded denunciation of both Palestinian and Israeli extremism
("Barbarism Runs Rampant in the Holy Land," Commentary, July 24). For
far too long the Palestinian leadership and Ariel Sharon's government
have deferred to the desires of right-wing and fanatical elements who
have no intention of taking the necessary first steps toward resuming
a peace process. This has predictably led to a mutually abhorrent
dance of death and destruction.</LD>
<LD>   Equally significant, this deference to extremism has
simultaneously diverted attention from the urgent goals of ending the
occupation, establishing a viable Palestinian state, ensuring
Israel's territorial and physical security and establishing
normalized relations between Israel and all the nations of the Arab
and Muslim world. The time has come for those of us in the United
States who are committed to these goals to speak out in support of
new Palestinian and Israeli leaders who will reject and isolate the
many extremist elements on all sides--both here and in the Middle
East.</LD>

<TE>   Re Hamas plans to retaliate against Israel: If I understand the
situation correctly, Hamas is going to use bombs that have already
been built, in locations that have already been selected, carried by
children who have already been recruited to retaliate against Israel
for assassinating the person who headed up the planning and funding
of these terrorist attacks. Hamas might have credibility if it would
cease suicide terrorism and recognize Israel's right to exist.</TE>

<TE>   Re "The Necessity of Targeted Assassinations," Commentary, July
25: I was disgusted and outraged by Steven R. David's article. After
all, murder is murder and evil is evil. When any government makes
murdering its enemies without proof or due process its official
policy, it removes any moral ground that the perpetrators of these
acts might claim to stand on.</TE>
<TE>   How are the lives of the 14 innocent Palestinian civilians killed
in the Israeli bombing in Gaza any different from those of innocent
Israeli civilians killed in bombings in their cities? More important,
how can apologists like David rationalize these evil activities?
Peace in that region can only be achieved by talking to each other.
It seems by their actions that the current government in Israel has
no interest in doing that.</TE>

<HD>Aviation Museum Folds Its Wings</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>What a shame to lose the Santa Monica Museum of Flying, one of the
last aviation museums at a working civil aviation airport (July 23).
It is trying to move to a more rural location in Southern California.
Not only is the local history we lose important, but the chance to be
"inside the fence" is a wonderful experience. To be close to and
touch--and maybe take a flight in--a vintage aircraft is one of those
potentially life-changing experiences that seldom occur anymore.</LD>
<LD>   People in the Burbank/Glendale area can point to another lost
opportunity. They had the birthplace of the Lockheed Skunkworks (and
a continuous history of aviation achievement for over 70 years) and
let it all be torn down and redeveloped. They let their heritage
disappear. That leaves the California Science Center's Air and Space
Gallery in Exposition Park, a nice collection but not particularly
connected with local history.</LD>
<LD>   Best of luck to the Museum of Flying. And please visit the Web
site at www.godickson.com/ahsfv.htm and help us preserve our great
aviation history.</LD>

<LD>The pools at Deep Creek offer more than a cool dip on a hot day ("Not
Everyone Gets Into Deep Creek's Pools," July 20). In August 1999, my
son and a friend were camping at the pools when they became trapped
by the rapidly burning Willow fire that blazed south through the
mountains. Having no escape, they jumped into a pool and, with just
their heads above water, managed to breathe through soaked towels as
the fire raced past them.</LD>
<LD>   The pictures they took after the ground had cooled enough for them
to walk out showed a blackened moonscape with just a narrow band of
greenery surrounding the pool that saved them.</LD>

<HD>Tiger Woods Plays at Golf Clubs That Exclude Women</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was greatly confused as I read "Tiger Shoots a Bogey in Social
Consciousness," Michael D'Antonio's July 23 commentary regarding
Tiger Woods and the crusade for social consciousness. It seems to me
that D'Antonio is comparing the rules of men-only, private golf clubs
with apartheid.</LD>
<LD>   First of all, it needs to be noted that Woods is not a member of
the Augusta National Golf Club. He is merely a participant in the
yearly event held there, called the Masters. Woods is also not a
member of Scotland's Muirfield. How can a man who is not a member of
a private club say something about how it should change its rules?
Comparing apartheid to golf is just ludicrous. There is no
"apartheid" in golf. Women play golf all over the United States, and
many golf clubs in America allow women members. To say that "women
... are second-class citizens in the game" is ignorant and
ridiculous.</LD>
<LD>   Woods is a golfer, an entertainer. The reason he makes money is
because fans of the sport watch him on television, whose stations are
paid big money by corporate advertisers. He is no different from
movie stars. Yes, he is popular. Does this mean every popular
entertainer should pick up some political cause and try to satisfy
his or her own political agenda? He should not be criticized for
respecting the rules of a private club.</LD>
<TE>   Hector Reyes</TE>
<TE>   Burbank</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Woods' lack of "social consciousness" exists only in D'Antonio's
lack of consciousness. D'Antonio takes Woods' quotes out of context,
never really answers the question, "Why Woods?" (and not, say,
Justice Clarence Thomas) and never explains what Woods' rare score of
81 (not to mention the 65 the next day) has to do with social issues.</TE>
<TE>   D'Antonio blithely skirts the heart of the matter--that if Woods
acted as the critics demand he would then be lambasted for that. To
paraphrase something Joni Mitchell said in an interview, you'll get
crucified for whatever you do, so do what your conscience dictates.
Authenticity is the only tool we possess to effect positive change.</TE>
<TE>   Lorraine Carpinelli</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Woods didn't betray women golfers when he said that male-only golf
clubs have a right to do what they want. Women have been betrayed by
the hundreds of men--who were birthed by women, are married to women
and have daughters--who play day after day and year after year on
those exclusive courses. It's ridiculous for reporters and the rest
of us to expect Woods to register an opinion and take a stance just
because of his skin color. The question should be put to every single
man on that golf course, regardless of his color, why they support
such exclusion. Put the responsibility where it belongs.</TE>

<LD>Re "Noncitizens Must Report if They Move," July 23: If the Justice
Department is going to enforce a 50-year-old law that requires
noncitizens older than 14 years of age to report changes of address
within 10 days of moving, then it should also start enforcing all
immigration laws and go after illegal immigrants. After all, only a
few of the 8 million to 9 million illegal immigrants are expected to
comply with this new policy.</LD>
<LD>   What is the effect of this large number of lawbreakers on border
security and on the ability of the INS to locate noncitizens targeted
for deportation? Doesn't it make this policy useless from the very
beginning?</LD>

<TE>   Hey, fellow noncitizens--alias legal residents, alias legal
aliens--let's give the Justice Department something to do this summer
and send an e-mail, or better yet, a lovely postcard, to the
attention of Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft with our addresses. If you are
moving soon, send the old and new address to make it more
challenging.</TE>
<TE>   This administration is reminding me more and more of the McCarthy
era, with its angst. Then, the enemy lurking everywhere was a
communist, now it's those dangerous foreigners. Beware!</TE>

<TE>   When I move, I notify the post office so that my mail can be
forwarded, the Department of Motor Vehicles, The Times so that my
newspaper delivery can be changed, all the magazines that I subscribe
to, the utility companies, professional associations, as a lawyer the
State Bar, my friends and countless others. Noncitizen residents
surely do the same. Why is it so difficult for them to add the INS to
the list?</TE>

<LD>Re "Girl Found Dead Inside Father's Van," July 25: They make car
alarms that go off if there is any motion detected from outside the
vehicle. Surely there could be an alarm built that would go off if
motion is detected inside a locked vehicle, loud enough to alert all
nearby that a child may be in danger. Then maybe, just maybe, adults
would think twice before leaving their young ones alone inside a
locked car.</LD>

<HD>The Home Team</HD>
<DH>Long Beach families open their doors to the up-and-coming
boys of summer</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Coltons consider their hometown baseball team family. Robin
Colton and her son Tyler are season ticket-holders of the Long Beach
Breakers. They are members of the team's booster club. And Tyler, 8,
wears one of his two autographed Breaker T-shirts to every home game.</LD>
<LD>   Also, the team's starting shortstop sleeps in their spare bedroom.</LD>
<LD>   Despite being last year's champions of the independent Western
Baseball League, the Breakers still can't afford to pay players a
big-league wage. Whereas the average salary in the majors is about
$195,000 per month, the average Breaker pulls down about $1,200 a
month. Rookies can make as little as $600 per month. So, for Breaker
fans, it's not so much root, root, root as it is put up a roof, roof,
roof for the home team.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm glad to do it because these kids don't make any money," said
Colton, 47, an escrow officer. "Tyler loves it because it's like
having a big brother here, and I love it because there's an adult to
talk to."</TE>
<TE>   The Coltons were one of a trio from the Breakers' Blair Field
stands to step up to the plate and house their local boys of summer.
The practice is not all that unusual. Minor league clubs from hockey
to football sometimes tap the community for seasonal shelter. The
sports organizations are, after all, businesses, albeit not the most
lucrative, and they cut corners where they can.</TE>
<TE>   Clubs like the Breakers sell the lodge-a-player deal to fans by
offering free season tickets, discounts on Breaker merchandise, and
the firsthand experience of getting to know an aspiring major
leaguer. "It's sort of like having a foreign-exchange student," said
Collin Schoenfeld, assistant general manager of the Breakers, who
pairs players with host homes.</TE>
<TE>   A very large, home-grown foreign-exchange student. The Coltons'
new boarder is 6-foot-3, 190-pound Kevin Baderdeen. Even though he
speaks perfect English, the polite 25-year-old shortstop with the
strong throwing arm still had to learn the language of his new home.
His first day, Colton, a single mom who displays the American flag in
front of her house and had flags painted on the tops of her big
toenails, spoke loud and clear about the rules inside her
three-bedroom, one-bath home in east Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Make your bed. Put your dishes in the dishwasher. Put the toilet
seat down.</TE>
<TE>   "He's two for three," jokes Colton, who describes herself as a
substitute mom for Baderdeen. "He's good with the dishes and the
seat, but not the bed. But that's OK, he keeps his bedroom door
shut."</TE>
<TE>   Not far from the Coltons' house, Harold Ray had the "house rules"
chat earlier this summer with his Breaker player, relief pitcher Joe
Isaacson. The 82-year-old retired grocery store manager welcomed the
company. After 57 years of marriage, his wife, Ada, died a few years
ago. Other than his volunteer work as a driver delivering meals to
seniors, and going to Breaker games, Ray doesn't have much contact
with others. He lives alone in his quiet house a couple miles from
the ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   When Isaacson, 24, arrived in early June, Ray told him what
he told the player he housed last season: "I don't expect you to clean
up my mess, and I don't expect to clean up yours."</TE>
<TE>   The talkative Ray, who dons his Breaker ball cap for every home
game, immediately liked Isaacson. "He's a great kid. He's clean and
neat," said Ray, who served in the same military unit during World
War II as legendary St. Louis Cardinal Stan Musial. "He's a little
bashful, but I'm trying to draw it out of him."</TE>
<TE>   Another Breaker player, Matt Harrington, was also hosted by a
local family, but the former Palmdale High pitching star declined to
talk about it. Had the young talent played his cards differently, he
might have been in a position to shelter a struggling ballplayer
himself--in beachfront digs.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Harrington was the Colorado Rockies' No. 1 pick in the
draft and was offered $4 million. He turned it down, hoping to get
$4.95 million. He didn't get it and reentered the draft the following
year when he was offered $1.2 million by the San Diego Padres. He
rejected that as well. Eventually, the once-hot prospect tumbled his
way to the Breakers. But less than midway through the Breakers'
90-game schedule, which ends in August, Harrington was released from
the team for performance reasons, according to Schoenfeld.</TE>
<TE>   Such roster moves are common. Last year, the Breakers, who usually
carry a little more than 20 players, made nearly 30 personnel
changes, Schoenfeld said. The team is on pace for similar numbers
this year.</TE>
<TE>   The reason is simple: The organization wants to win and
players want to move up, namely to a minor league baseball team affiliated
with a Major League club. A few Breakers have made it, but most do
not. When management sees a player who isn't contributing, he's cut.
From there, released players may seek other independent leagues in
the States, go to Mexico or quit.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball players are vagabonds," Schoenfeld said. "They'll
usually go anywhere to play."</TE>
<TE>   But right now Baderdeen is in Long Beach--another stop on the road
to the majors--and is gratefully living with a host family. If not
for the Coltons, the affable infielder would have had to commute from
his grandmother's house in Ontario or his sister's home in Brea. "I
would have had to spend my whole paycheck on gas," said Baderdeen,
who played three years with a Cincinnati Reds farm team until he
broke his jaw and was released in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Although Baderdeen probably could have pooled his finances with
other players and gone in on an apartment--players stay with host
families for free--he realizes hanging out with a bunch of young
athletes after the ballgames can be hazardous to your sleep and other
things.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're living with a family, it keeps you out of trouble,"
said Baderdeen, who previously lived with a host family in Dayton,
Ohio, when playing with the Reds' minor league team. "You feel a
responsibility to help out, to behave yourself, especially if they
have little kids."</TE>
<TE>   Though he's not home too much given the team's grueling schedule,
which allows for only 10 days off this summer, Baderdeen so far has
fixed the VCR, an exercise machine, folded loads of laundry and
regularly wrenches the cap off apple juice bottles for Tyler. And
then, there was the TP episode.</TE>
<TE>   Late one recent night, Baderdeen and his girlfriend, who was in
town for a visit, returned home to find it had rained toilet paper.
Tissue was hanging from the trees like streamers, wrapped around
Colton's car, everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Robin works too hard to come home to that," said Baderdeen, who
cleaned up the mess in about 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "It must have been your ballplayer friends," Colton teased the
next morning while making a pancake and eggs breakfast. "Tyler's
friends don't stay up that late."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, maybe it was somebody who saw me go 0 for 4 last night,"
replied Baderdeen, referring to a recent batting slump.</TE>
<TE>   The close quarters often result in close relationships between
host and ballplayer in which traits not readily apparent are
gradually revealed. After a few days, Ray began noticing something
funny about Isaacson's diet.</TE>
<TE>   "I never seen a guy eat so much tuna in my life," said
Ray, patting his ample belly. " Me, I eat whatever you put in front of
me."</TE>
<TE>   Isaacson, a left-handed pitcher powered by his fastball and
slider, soon learned that his octogenarian roommate was once an
athlete too. Ray played baseball and football in high school--until a
broken leg in a football game landed him in a bed for three months.
Ray also had a cousin who played for the St. Louis Cardinals in the
1960s.</TE>
<TE>   And he's a sports nut who traveled halfway around the world to be
at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Australia. He's also been known to
videotape water polo matches.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a super guy," said Isaacson of his host. "He's got a lot of
stories to tell and he really gets around for a guy in his 80s."</TE>
<TE>   Baderdeen and Tyler have developed their own rapport. The pro
shortstop is a big brother of sorts to the Little League catcher/left
fielder whose bedroom is just a wall away this summer. Baderdeen has
given Tyler a few pointers on his game, which helped the youngster
lead his team to the championship series this year. He also plays
pool and throws the football with his housemate.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Tyler has been a typical little brother--at once
admiring and annoying. He notes that Baderdeen sleeps too much and
snores when he does. But on a recent night in the stands, Tyler
beamed as Baderdeen scored from third after a base hit.</TE>
<TE>   "Go, Kevin!" he shouted.</TE>
<TE>   During a morning battle on a Nintendo game, Tyler's penchant for
resetting the score every time he lost the lead tried the
considerable patience of Baderdeen, whose good humor was fortified by
growing up with four siblings. After about the 20th reset, Baderdeen
threatened a work stoppage.</TE>
<TE>   "If you do that again, I'm quitting," he said. It worked. They
finally finished a game and like any big brother worth his salt,
Baderdeen was victorious.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell my friends I have two boys," Colton said. "A big one and a
little one."</TE>
<TE>   The Breaker players are all part boy, still motivated by a dream
born in ballpark summers long ago. They endure bad days at the plate
and in the field, low pay, a grueling schedule, scrambling for
off-season jobs, and uncertain futures all in hopes of wearing a
major league uniform one day.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be on TV someday," Isaacson said.</TE>
<TE>   But that dream will have to wait. He was released just before
Father's Day. The bad news capped a week in which he rear-ended a
car, got a speeding ticket, had a credit card stolen and gave up
three runs in one inning.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me they didn't see anything in me," said Isaacson, who
is back living with his parents in Santa Barbara, where he'll decide
whether to continue pursuing a career in baseball.</TE>
<TE>   One of the hardest things about the day was telling Ray, Isaacson
said. "He was as blindsided as I was," Isaacson recalled. "I had to
tell him three times before he understood that I got released."</TE>
<TE>   Said Ray, who is not sure whether he'll put up another player this
season: "I'm going to miss that guy around here. It's real quiet when
you live by yourself. He was a nice fella, and he kind of took the
void spot out of the house."</TE>

<TE>   "Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat"</TE>
<TE>   by Amy Tan</TE>
<TE>   This book is about a Siamese cat named Sagwa of China. Sagwa was a
kitten. Her mom and dad could write with their tails. One day Sagwa
fell into the pot of ink where the tails are dipped. She wiped her
feet on a scroll of rules. Read it to find out what happens next. I
recommend this book because it is very fun to read.</TE>

<TE>   "Baby Whale"</TE>
<TE>   by Lynn Wilson</TE>
<TE>   This book is about a baby whale and its mother. A baby humpback
whale can drink more than 800 glasses of its mother's milk every day.
I was surprised to know it could drink so much milk. Whales travel
3,000 miles from Hawaii to Alaska to eat krill. The baby whale stays
with its mother for about one year. I really liked this book.</TE>

<HD>Doc Martens Trying to Pull Up Its Socks</HD>
<DH>The battered shoe brand is seeking ways to get a leg up in
the industry</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HANK STUEVER</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Late last week, a thoroughly British icon of all that's punk and
oddly comforting sent up a flare indicating a spot of trouble.</LD>
<LD>   Sales are way off for Dr. Martens footwear--the giant-soled combat
boot and assorted shoes that came to mean so much to the kind of
people who wished not to be entirely understood.</LD>
<LD>   The fashionably rebellious have, of course, moved on from the
combat boot seen in the mosh pits of yore. Hard-core punks, skinheads
and goth kids are still bitter about the decade-long sellout of their
beloved Docs, to the point where the shoe became widely seen on the
Man (who bought them at Macy's and wore them to work, in a bloody
cubicle).</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Martens' parent company, the R. Griggs Group, in addition to
announcing that it will close one of its three factories in England,
put forth some ideas to "shape new perceptions about the brand." Soon
it will be coming up with shoes that will be lighter in weight,
different in style, prettier. (It will continue to make the "1460,"
its trademark black, eight-eyelet, lace-up boot of 42 years, along
with other classic styles.)</TE>
<TE>   "We'll always have a core group of consumers, but there were
opportunities to evolve. I don't think we evolved enough," Bobbie
Parisi, global brand director for Dr. Martens, says from Portland,
Ore. "There is still a lot of opportunity for us to evolve. In my own
mind, the brand name stands for self-expression, and we think there's
a way for that to be carried on."</TE>
<TE>   But self-expression is a difficult thing to bottle and sell to 5
million selves, which is how many people bought a pair of Docs last
year. (Dr. Martens says sales will be "well down" this year.)</TE>
<TE>   Just as Levi's 501 jeans and Adidas track suits and Lacoste tennis
shirts have all learned a thing or two about the ebb and flow of a
finicky phenomenon called "retro," Dr. Martens will probably learn
the hard way that what goes around comes around and then it has to
leave again.</TE>
<TE>   Inasmuch as it's a story about one business hitting a slump, the
Doc Martens falloff is a larger tale about a philosophy of life being
in trouble. Decades never quite begin and end according to the
calendar, yet there is delayed evidence that the '90s are over:
Planes hit skyscrapers, Internet whiz kids are moving back into their
parents' houses and nobody is rich anymore except the rich.</TE>
<TE>   And Doc Martens, as we knew them, are passe.</TE>
<TE>   The future isn't as grimy and post-apocalyptic as we were led to
believe. For all its artificiality and cleaner lines, it's a lot more
real. It is again a striped-sneaker kind of place, with loafers and
slides.</TE>
<TE>   It all began when Klaus Maertens, a German medical doctor, injured
a foot while skiing in the Bavarian Alps. Recuperating, Maertens and
an engineer named Herbert Funck designed an air-sole shoe to take the
load off. They marketed the shoe locally, and eventually sold the
patent to R. Griggs &amp; Co., shoemakers of London. The first pair of
black boots--with the thick, patented, heat-sealed sole and
distinctive yellow stitching--were made in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   After that, no marketing plan could have intuited the slow path to
high fashion that the boots took.</TE>
<TE>   London Mods wore them, and so did the police officers who chased
their scooters. The first punks wore them. The ska bands wore them,
and the goth kids wore them. The second coming of punk wore them (or
wore the Converse All-Star sneaker, now no longer made in America but
in China), and the widely defined "grunge/alternative" universe
heat-sealed the shoe's fate.</TE>
<TE>   By then, a pair of boots cost $120 or more, millions and millions
were sold, and there's not much punk about that. In everyone's rush
to be alternative, the Doc Martens lost its angry credibility.</TE>
<TE>   But Parisi isn't about to give up.</TE>
<TE>   She describes the new Dr. Martens campaign and talks about some of
the new sandals. The soles are about one-quarter of the thickness of
the old Dr. Martens sole, she says.</TE>
<TE>   A kicky pair of thong sandals craftily incorporates the logo seen
on the loop on the back of the original 1460 boot, "and there are
lots of colors."</TE>

<HD>Wonder Boy Spins a Dark Tale</HD>
<DH>Drugs, violence and self-indulgent Manhattan teens populate
'Twelve'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The teen Tolstoy and his friends are at the Skyline Diner, their
favorite place on the Upper East Side to hog a booth for a couple of
hours. But this July afternoon while Juliet and Jeff and the others
eat eggs, and smirk back at Nick McDonell, he is giving an interview
about his first novel, "Twelve," a tale of debauched Manhattan
preppies.</LD>
<LD>   His promoters say McDonell is a voice of a new generation.</LD>
<LD>   McDonell just says he is one lucky 18-year-old.</LD>
<TE>   "I just sort of had an itch, so I wrote," he says, peering through
shaggy bangs to check for reaction. "I didn't want to expose private
schools or make a statement. I had an idea for a story and, you know,
what do you do? It's a question in the book: What do you do? I write,
is what I do, you know, that's how I get control."</TE>
<TE>   How he got published has to do with his upbringing.</TE>
<TE>   McDonell's godfathers are writers Hunter S. Thompson and P.J.
O'Rourke; writer-actor George Plimpton is a mentor; his publisher,
Morgan Entrekin at Grove/Atlantic, met him when he was 2 days old;
his mother, Joan McDonell, is a novelist; and father Terry McDonell
is a well-regarded editor who has headed many magazines, including
Esquire and Outside, and now runs Sports Illustrated.</TE>
<TE>   At 16, Nick McDonell broke his leg playing basketball and, thus,
began his literary career. In the 40 days he was laid up--"very
biblical, you know?"--he started a magazine at his private school and
outlined a novel. After two issues, including one about violence, the
magazine died, but danger and blood seeped into the novel, which
McDonell fleshed out over the next summer in the Hamptons at his
mom's beach house.</TE>
<TE>   In short order, McDonell let his parents and younger brother, Tom,
read it; gave it to Entrekin; was edited; and had an advance copy of
his book before his senior prom. About a week after June graduation,
McDonell received his first major (positive) review in advance of its
release last week, and he's now touring 16 U.S. cities and two
foreign countries with a publicist, giving new meaning to the work of
a chaperon. He starts Harvard in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   So what is left for the boy?</TE>
<TE>   Cranky, middle-aged observers might caution about such early
success, of comparisons to Joyce and Hemingway, nevermind a lesser
light like Bret Easton Ellis, who similarly portrayed dissolute teens
in Los Angeles and then faded away. And Joyce Maynard was 18 when she
was hailed as the voice of the 1970s generation, but turned out not
to be.</TE>
<TE>   McDonell's response is a verbal shiver: "I hear ya."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the publishing world and its hyperactive publicity
machine have planned for McDonell, he has his own ideas that predate
"Twelve." Since forever he has been listening to his parents' writer
friends describe travels and has dreamed of being a foreign
correspondent, filing from "far-flung continents."</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in the journalist-adventurer, going out and telling the
truth, doing all that stuff. That's naive and ridiculous, but I
really bought into it, especially when I was younger."</TE>
<TE>   In the immediate future, McDonell craves dorm life.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just looking forward to living with a lot of people my own
age," he says. "Especially after this summer, which is going to be
with a lot of old people, well, older people."</TE>
<TE>   Again, McDonell is 18. He is also 6 feet tall, handsome with
imperfect skin, stylish in a T-shirt, sweetly self-conscious,
articulate and unnervingly mature in his self-possession and
sophistication. He reads a lot and is toting Saul Bellow's "The
Adventures of Augie March." He got a B-minus in Advanced Placement
writing. His parents are divorced. He is devoted to his brother, and
cares what his friends think of him, tensing when pal Jeff Deutchman,
on his way out of the Skyline, is asked for a comment.</TE>
<TE>   "Nick?" says Deutchman, with a sly smile, "He's a looker."</TE>
<TE>   The back booth is breaking up now. Deutchman, a budding filmmaker
already attending Northwestern, is off to a summer office job. Juliet
Lapidos follows, but first the comparative literature major at Yale
offers a critique of "Twelve."</TE>
<TE>   She shuffles her foot in and out of a flip-flop and begins: "Well,
when I read 'Twelve,' I was still at school and I read it over the
course of about a week and I was reading 'War and Peace'
simultaneously. So it's not exactly fair because you should compare
people to authors who are writing at the same times as they are...."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, but did she like the novel?</TE>
<TE>   Definitely, she says. Still, she raises a question similar to that
of reviewers who found merit in the book's writing ("brisk
authority," said one) and the characters compelling but wonder how
the author's age should be weighted in their assessments.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think it's hard to put [McDonell's age] out of mind,"
Lapidos says. " 'War and Peace' is good, timeless, regardless of who
Tolstoy was. Hopefully, the same will be true of 'Twelve,' but it's
impossible for me to say."</TE>
<TE>   As she flip-flops away, McDonell explains that Lapidos, who wants
to be a professor, and all his "good" friends are different from
"Twelve's" characters. "All of my friends are sort of
hyper-literate," he says. "They read voraciously. They know what they
want to do. In the book, they're not like that."</TE>
<TE>   Blending Reality, Fantasy</TE>
<TE>   McDonell drew from people and events around him, but mostly this
is a fantasy that ends with all but the main character, White Mike,
gunned down by a kid in a video-game-type slaughter. The violence, as
much as the spiritual emptiness of the characters, is likely to make
parents of adolescents uncomfortable--or even more uncomfortable than
they already are about what their kids do when they're not around.</TE>
<TE>   McDonell explains that some of the gruesome scenes, such as when a
character, Claude, hooks his finger inside a kid's cheek and tears
the flesh, came from stories he'd heard but didn't believe: "The
cheek ripped with an audible tear and all this blood fell on the bar
and into the martinis," McDonell writes. "The kid was screaming and
clutching his face, and Claude just walked out of the bar."</TE>
<TE>   Says McDonell, "Somebody came up to me after that was excerpted in
the New York Post and said, 'I know the kid who did that. You cheat.
You took that.' I couldn't believe it was for real. So when people
ask me whether the book is autobiographical, well, it's made up of
things like these urban myths. So, if they're real, well, then
they're real."</TE>
<TE>   For the elder McDonell, his son's calmly observed narrative and
the profession he has joined so young make him uneasy: "The kids that
I know through my two sons are smart and articulate, and they fill
you with unspecific dread because they seem to have appropriated a
certain freedom that would put them in harm's way in the city, and,
in Nick's case, in a career that he's way too young for."</TE>
<TE>   But Terry McDonell is counting on his son's habits to see him
through: "There's salvation in work. Nick grew up being told that: Do
work."</TE>
<TE>   The story Nick McDonell wrote--1,000 words a day, 25,000 over a
summer--follows White Mike and 10 teens, from the overindulged Chris
and the young siren Sara to the drug dealer Lionel, through five days
ending on New Year's Eve. Unlike the others, White Mike restrains
from indulgence. Intelligent and detached, White Mike is a former
preppie who, rather than go to college, deals drugs, including
Twelve, a fictional white-powdered concoction.</TE>
<TE>   The three-paragraph Chapter 42 explains why White Mike remains
sober and reveals a theme in McDonell's book:</TE>
<TE>   " 'I think I know why you don't drink,' said Alice. They were in a
bar on Second Avenue that served kids. She was drinking a
Cosmopolitan. He was drinking coffee.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Why?' asked White Mike.</TE>
<TE>   " 'You like the power you have from being sober all the time
around people who are [messed] up.' "</TE>
<TE>   The other characters course through their days doing drugs,
obsessing over sex or, in one boy's case, guns and trying to be cool,
as a way to acquire control. McDonell does away with parents in his
novel; they are absent or oblivious. Clearly, this is not his life
story. His parents were around: "My dad went to every one of my
football games," he says. "My mother was always in everything."</TE>
<TE>   Without a lot of perfumed verbs or smooth transitions--perhaps
explaining that B-minus in AP writing--McDonell soaked up all that
was around him and imagined the worst.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to say whether a comparable effort would have been
published if the author did not have McDonell's connections.
Publisher Entrekin says, "Many doors were opened because Nick was the
'son of,' but you have to have talent to walk through them."</TE>
<TE>   McDonell says he has the determination to be published again. He
has started a second novel, but all he will say is that it is about
something completely different.</TE>
<TE>   The night before he begins his book tour, he thinks about the road
ahead. "I don't mind lonely," he says, when asked about not seeing
friends for weeks and enduring more book signings.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not ashamed of my book, and I think it's for real, and I
think it's on the level ... I hope. But say what you will, I am one
of the luckiest guys in, you know, New York."</TE>

<LD>I'm almost home when my cell phone rings. The voice on the other
end--full of dread--is that of Johnny, my fiance, whom I've just
dropped off after a night on the town.</LD>
<LD>   "Tell me my wallet is in your car," he says. "Under the seat
maybe, or on the floor." I pull over and turn on the lights, get out
of the car and check around. There is no sign of his black leather
wallet, last spotted bulging with cash.</LD>
<LD>   "Did you check your pocket?" I ask him, unwilling to believe that
the wallet could have just disappeared.</LD>
<TE>   "Of course," he says, bristling at the question. "That's how I
know it's missing. My pocket's unbuttoned and my wallet's not there."</TE>
<TE>   We think back, retrace our steps. It could have slipped out at the
restaurant, after he paid the dinner tab. Or it might have been
lifted by a pickpocket as we made our way through the dance club
crowd. He remembers being jostled, but it didn't occur to him then to
check for his wallet.</TE>
<TE>   And perpetual optimist that he is, he's still having a hard time
believing it's gone.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of people have been feeling like Johnny lately, blindsided
by financial loss, searching their ledgers for evidence that the
money they counted on for retirement hasn't really disappeared. They
are reaching into the pockets that held their future and discovering
that they, too, may have been pickpocketed.</TE>
<TE>   News accounts tell us that the stock market's decline has wiped
out trillions of dollars in wealth in a slide driven by corporate
scandals and what Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has called
"the infectious greed" of the business community.</TE>
<TE>   While that doesn't equate to poverty, it does affect the bottom
line for many families. More than half of American households now own
stock, much of it packaged with other investments in retirement plans
that are supposed to provide a cushion for our golden years.</TE>
<TE>   The market fall has torpedoed the hopes of millions, whose worth
skyrocketed in the past few years when the market soared to
irrational highs, then plummeted just as quickly due to corporate
misdeeds.</TE>
<TE>   Much of that wealth was on paper only, but it fueled our dreams
and seemed a ticket to limitless possibilities. It reflected our
optimism--and more than a touch of naivete and greed--rather than
economic certainty.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't make the loss less cruel or the emotional adjustments
less painful. Dying are dreams of retirement cruises, second homes at
the beach, an early exit from careers that have long ceased to be
fulfilling. The crash has put marriages on the skids, as couples
bicker about whose fault it is. It has forced retirees back to the
streets, knocking on doors of companies that are no longer hiring.
More than a third of Americans between 50 and 64 say they will have
to delay retirement because so many of their assets have disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   It's not only the missing money but the lost chances that sting;
the feeling that doors that once swung open are now being closed.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sure lost chances dogged my parents too. They could not have
survived the Great Depression without learning how to let go of
dreams and making do on less than what they needed.</TE>
<TE>   I grew up in a family in which there were no discussions of
portfolios and investment plans, because we had nothing to invest.
There were no pensions or stock plans or college accounts. To my dad,
financial planning consisted of playing the numbers in Cleveland's
illicit lottery. My parents never had a chance to retire. They owned
two homes and put three kids through college. And when they died,
still on the job, they left us no inheritance; just a few thousand
dollars in life insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Still, I don't remember them worrying about money, and I don't
remember ever feeling that we went without. My father owned a
barbershop. Sometimes he made enough that one of us could get braces,
another could take piano lessons. There were summer vacations and
stays in hotels. During lean times he took a second job, and my
mother went to work as well.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't learn much from them about financial management. I still
don't know how stock options work or the difference between a bond
and a mutual fund. I raise my children much as they did, spending
what I have on what we need, banking what I can for a rainy day and
occasionally buying a lottery ticket.</TE>
<TE>   But they taught me something else, and that comforts me when I
think about Johnny's missing wallet and the profits that have
vanished from my already-meager stock accounts: Money comes and money
goes, and moping over its loss is as futile as spending it before you
get it.</TE>
<TE>   Profit and loss statements aren't a measure of a life. And there's
so much more than money to the bottom line.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The fare was so tempting, even Wolfgang Puck got in line.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll have a hot dog," the famous chef said, approaching the
Belvedere restaurant's booth at the American Cancer Society's 18th
annual Gourmet Gala.</LD>
<LD>   But this was no weenie-slapped-in-a-bun. This was chicken and foie
gras sausage topped with morel mushroom relish and oven-dried tomato
ketchup tucked into a roll. "Ummmmmm," Puck said, savoring a bite.</LD>
<TE>   Along with his wife, Barbara Lazaroff , and Paramount Chairwoman
Sherry Lansing, Puck was a host of the July 21 fund-raiser that raked
in $650,000 for the society's research, education, advocacy and
patient-service programs. Held at the tree-studded Brentwood estate
of radio mogul Ken Roberts, the afternoon affair attracted more than
800 foodies and honored Jerry Katell, president of Katell Properties
LLC.</TE>
<TE>   Wending their way through booths set up on the 112-acre estate's
tennis court and rolling lawns, guests--who'd paid $300 a
ticket--sampled corn tamales with Oaxacan chicken mole from Granita;
suckling pig on cornbread from Lucques; mini Gorgonzola burgers from
Vert; tandoori lamb with mint-cilantro chutney from Spago Beverly
Hills and more.</TE>
<TE>   "Where else can you get this amount of quality food at this
price?" asked Lazaroff, who dressed for the sun-dappled garden party
in a green print Galliano, multitone necklace she'd bought in Capri,
Italy, and a hat festooned with feathers. Speaking of hats, there
were very few at the party.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how anybody can show up today without a hat,"
Lazaroff said with a sniff.</TE>
<TE>   A founder of the 18-year-old gala, Puck said he was gratified to
watch it grow from a small event to the significant fund-raiser it is
today. "When you're a kid, you don't think so much about cancer," he
said. "But when you grow up, it becomes almost an everyday thing to
hear of a friend or family member who has the disease. I have been
grateful for this chance to give back to the community."</TE>
<TE>   Katell, who lost his wife, Sharon, three years ago to colon
cancer, attended the gala with 20 family members, including his four
children. "It's a great honor to be recognized, particularly because
of the way cancer has impacted my life," he said. "I lost my wife at
56 to colon cancer and my mother to Hodgkin's disease when she was
32. This honor is really for them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Just Desserts</TE>
<TE>   They discoed to Boogey Knights. Rocked to Smittin. Reggaed to
Elan. And for those who paid twice the $75 admission price, there was
a VIP lounge where SmackDaddy serenaded them with rockin' blues until
the wee hours. If it all became too much, they repaired to a "chill
room" for a cool one and a breather.</TE>
<TE>   So it went for the 2,500 young professionals who showed up at the
palatial Park Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles for the annual Justice Ball
benefiting Bet Tzedek Legal Services. When the clock struck 1 a.m.,
$300,000 had been raised to provide free legal assistance to
low-income residents of Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been impressed by Bet Tzedek's mission
statement--unless everyone has access to the law, there is no
justice," said actor Greg Germann (Fox's "Ally McBeal"), a
co-chairman of the July 20 event. "I'm happy to be able to lend my
name to something that does so much good in the world." Camryn
Manheim of ABC's "The Practice," also a co-chair, echoed Germann's
comments: "All people are entitled to their basic human rights--not
just some--all."</TE>
<TE>   Bet Tzedek is a nonprofit public-interest law firm that assists
the "elderly, indigent and disabled," said executive director David
Lash. "We open up 4,000 to 5,000 cases every year and represent about
10,000 people annually. Our sole purpose is to provide equal access
to justice for people who would not otherwise be able to afford a
lawyer or get into court."</TE>
<TE>   The firm's House of Justice handles civil cases, such as home
equity fraud--"where scam artists try to entice seniors into loans
they don't need," Lash said--eviction defense and Holocaust survivors
seeking reparations denied for 50 to 60 years.</TE>
<TE>   The ball has raised $1.5 million since it was founded five years
ago by Los Angeles businessman Randall Kaplan. "Randy said he could
expose a whole new demographic to our work," Lash said. "He got this
event off the ground by the sheer force of his will."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Party Portrait</TE>
<TE>   Never mind the steel band and the swaying palms. At "Paint the
Party," all eyes were on a huge canvas and an artist named Sandra
Jones Campbell.</TE>
<TE>   Known for her boldly colored portraits of people in social
situations, Campbell was commissioned by Gran Centenario Tequila to
immortalize the event, a recognition party for donors of $1,000 or
more during the last year to AIDS Services Foundation Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Packing a Polaroid, Campbell snapped photographs of guests as they
sipped margaritas and peach "tequinis"--tequila mixed with fresh OJ
and a splash of peach schnapps--and dug into a gourmet repast at
Mark's restaurant in Laguna Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll use these photos for inspiration as I block out the
painting," explained Campbell, who started work on the painting
during the July 18 event. Dipping a large brush into pots of acrylic
paint, the artist used sweeping strokes to form the lively images: a
waitress balancing drinks on a tray, chatting party-goers, musicians
tapping steel drums and smiling host Mark De Palma. The finished
product will go on the auction block at the foundation's "World's
Fair: Paris" benefit on Sept. 14 at the Orange County Fairgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to honor our major donors because, with their help, we
will continue to be able to provide services to AIDS patients," said
Dan Gleason, executive director of the foundation. Due to the "soft
economy and the diversion of local funds to victims of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, we've been having difficulty raising revenue,"
Gleason said. "The effectiveness of new medications has more people
living with AIDS and yet we are seeing increasing rates of infection.
We have a bigger demand for services than ever before."</TE>

<LD>"I'm glad you could come to dinner, Squirrel," Rabbit said.</LD>
<LD>   "I am too," Squirrel said. "Here is a thank-you present." And he
handed Rabbit a package.</LD>
<LD>   "How nice!" Rabbit said.</LD>
<TE>   Then he sniffed the air. "Oh! My carrot nut stew smells like it is
burning!"</TE>
<TE>   Rabbit put the present down and ran to the stewpot.</TE>
<TE>   He stirred the stew. "Good!" he said. "It didn't burn."</TE>
<TE>   While they were eating, Rabbit and Squirrel decided to go fishing
the next morning. After dinner, they played Go Fish.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbit won.</TE>
<TE>   "I do like this game!" he said. "Do you want to play again,
Squirrel?"</TE>
<TE>   "All right," Squirrel said.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbit and Squirrel played three games of Go Fish.</TE>
<TE>   Then Squirrel looked at the clock.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, it's late!" he said. "I had better go home. I will see you
tomorrow, Rabbit."</TE>
<TE>   When Rabbit woke up the next morning, he said, "Oh my! I forgot
all about the present Squirrel brought me! Hmmmm, where did I put
it?"</TE>
<TE>   He looked under the sofa.</TE>
<TE>   He looked in back of the big chair.</TE>
<TE>   He looked under the table.</TE>
<TE>   He looked everywhere he could think of.</TE>
<TE>   But he did not find the present anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh dear," Rabbit said. "I've lost it!"</TE>
<TE>   And he began to cry.</TE>
<TE>   "Squirrel will think I did not like his present," he sobbed. "He
will think I lost it on purpose."</TE>
<TE>   There was a knock on the door.</TE>
<TE>   It was Squirrel.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are you crying, Rabbit?" Squirrel asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel terrible!" sobbed Rabbit. "I lost the present you gave
me!"</TE>
<TE>   "No, you didn't, Rabbit," Squirrel said.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbit wiped his eyes. "I didn't?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   "No," said Squirrel. "I took it home with me by mistake. I've been
feeling terrible all night."</TE>
<TE>   And he gave it back to Rabbit.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbit opened it.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, Squirrel!" he said. "It's the book I've been wanting! Thank
you!"</TE>
<TE>   "You're welcome," said Squirrel. "Now get your fishing pole and
let's go."</TE>
<TE>   And Rabbit did.</TE>

<BD>Jacob Heilbrunn is a Times editorial writer.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Now that the stock market bubble has burst, the notion of privatizing
Social Security might seem like a bad dream. A recent study by the
bipartisan Center for Economic and Policy Research found that if 5%
of Social Security payroll taxes had been carved out in each of the
last four years for individuals to invest in private stock accounts,
as was advocated by some privatization supporters, the accounts would
probably have lost about $72.65 billion--and that was before the
stock market slide of the last few weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Yet in a triumph of hope over experience, the Bush administration
is still arguing that allowing workers to invest Social Security
funds in personal accounts is a good idea. Spokesman Ari Fleischer
declared Wednesday that stocks were a "sound long-term" way to obtain
higher rates of return.</LD>
<LD>   Far from giving up, champions of privatization are gearing up for
another attack on Social Security. Their efforts are a textbook case
in how a fringe cause can become a central tenet of a Republican
administration, whether or not it flies in the face of reality.</LD>
<TE>   Beginning in the 1990s, a chorus of free-market intellectuals
started making the case that to avoid Social Security going bankrupt,
it must be privatized. The belief that workers would be hostage to
the vicissitudes of the market was dismissed as absurd. Writing in
July 2000, James K. Glassman, co-author of the book "Dow 36,000,"
proclaimed the emergence of a new investor class of middle-class
Americans who demanded market-friendly policies from Washington.
According to Glassman, "a Social Security reform that gives people
the option to create their own investment accounts would turbocharge
the movement toward middle-class capitalism." Cyberpundit Andrew
Sullivan remarked that "Social Security was a system designed in the
1930s, and the way it siphons vast amounts of productive capital into
low-paying government investments is explicable only in the context
of a country terrified of another Great Depression."</TE>
<TE>   If Sullivan offered a kind of patriotic argument for diverting
funds, Stephen Moore, president of the Club for Growth, offered a
more personal reason: "If you're younger than 40, you're a fool to
stay put. You can do much better opting out and privatizing your
Social Security." Social Security, he concluded, was nothing more
than "inter-generational theft."</TE>
<TE>   Given the gyrations the market has been experiencing, are Moore
and company a bit more cautious these days about advocating the
overthrow of a system that has helped ensure seniors for some seven
decades?</TE>
<TE>   Not at all. Moore breathes optimism: "What we're experiencing now
will show up just as a blip, the stock market will march back on its
merry way to normal rates of return. The swings we're seeing now are
just noise." Andrew G. Biggs, who was a staff member on the Bush
Commission to Strengthen Social Security and is an analyst at the
libertarian Cato Institute, agrees: "It's a tempest in a teapot....
The stock market doesn't affect underlying values at all.... With
privatization, your average return would be 6% after inflation. If we
had just started, you would have had a dip today but had a long time
to get rid of it."</TE>
<TE>   Even after Enron, columnist George F. Will called privatization
"the most direct path to participation in the economy's wealth
creation." Indeed, proponents argue that, precisely because the
market has collapsed, there is no better time to sink Social Security
funds into stocks.</TE>
<TE>   But if those arguments were flawed before the recent crash, they
are wholly fallacious in its aftermath. Social Security is supposed
to serve as a nest egg for seniors, not the source of speculative
profits that can go up or down. All the predictions of long-term gain
are well and good, but what if someone retires during a severe slump?
In a bear market, Social Security gives retirees a margin of comfort,
serving as a safety net that allows them to take risks with their
other assets if they choose to. The truth is that there will always
be winners and losers in the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   It's also the case that massive, government-sanctioned investment
in the stock market can have distorting effects. Take Japan.
Investment analyst James J. Cramer noted that government support
created an environment in Japan in which individuals and corporations
"became heavily enmeshed in a stock market that was totally divorced
from the 'fundamentals,' as we say on Wall Street." The Japanese
economy remains in the doldrums and companies are starved for capital
because the public has been burned and would rather keep its funds
under mattresses than in the market. Had the U.S. government already
been invested in stocks, the market could well have risen far
higher--and the current crash would be even more severe.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, it is not clear that Social Security is really going
under. Although its surplus has subsized debt reduction and tax cuts,
the fund still has one.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the Bush administration moves to derail Social Security,
the system is working exactly as intended. But if the collapse in
stocks can't dent the optimism of privatization champions, nothing
will.</TE>

In 1958, GOP infighting helped state Atty. Gen. Edmund G. "Pat" Brown
Sr. to become the state's first Democratic governor in almost two
decades. In what one author called "a political suicide pact," Gov.
Goodwin J. Knight was pushed into a U.S. Senate race because Sen.
William F. Knowland wanted the governorship to launch his bid for the
presidency. Both lost.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Brown's luck ran out in 1966. Thinking that political neophyte
Ronald Reagan would be easier to beat, Democrats dabbled in the GOP
primary to help defeat moderate San Francisco Mayor George
Christopher. They were wrong.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1978 governor's race, Pat's son, Jerry, was the unpopular
incumbent. But when his GOP challenger, Atty. Gen. Evelle J. Younger,
took off after the primary for an extended Hawaiian vacation, Brown
seized the political advantage. An opponent of Proposition 13, the
property-tax-reform initiative that had passed overwhelmingly in the
primary, Brown repositioned himself as a "born-again tax cutter."
Younger never gained traction.</TE>
<TE>   Davis stalwarts wistfully contemplate the 1994 governor's race. A
year before the election, polls showed Gov. Pete Wilson some 20
points behind his likely Democratic challenger, state Treasurer
Kathleen Brown. The California Journal anointed Wilson "the most
unpopular governor in the history of the state."</TE>
<TE>   But as the campaign wore on, the Journal marveled that "Wilson
seemed almost effortlessly able to convince voters that, whatever
their doubts about him, the alternative was worse. Brown helped by
running probably the most mistake-prone campaign in recent history."
Wilson, whose job-approval rating was 38% in a late October Los
Angeles Times Poll, won reelection with 55% of the vote, a 14-point
margin over Brown.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson? Never underestimate the importance of the opponent to
a candidate's success or failure.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has tasted defeat in the electoral arena, losing twice to
political powerhouses. In his first foray into elective politics, he
ran for state treasurer in 1974. But former Assembly Speaker Jesse M.
Unruh stepped in and waltzed off with the Democratic nomination. And
Davis blundered badly in 1992, the vaunted "year of the woman," when
he waged a disparaging campaign against Dianne Feinstein for the
Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' victories, on the other hand, have flattened obligingly
weak opponents. In the 1998 governor's race, Davis lucked out twice.
Two well-heeled opponents in the Democratic primary spent millions
taking each other down with negative ads, allowing Davis to break
through the middle and win. It was lucky, too, that Proposition 226
was on the same ballot. Union members flocked to the polls to defeat
the Wilson-backed initiative, which would have required workers'
written permission for unions to use their dues for political
purposes. Davis, the labor-endorsed Democrat, benefited mightily from
the fallout.</TE>
<TE>   In the general election, the political gods really smiled upon
Davis. His opponent, GOP Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, was the antithesis
of what a successful California candidate should be. His personality
was too "hot" for television, and his ideology too conservative for
the state's electorate. Davis won in a landslide.</TE>
<TE>   After two rosy years in office, the governor's luck seemingly
soured. The reasons are familiar: the energy crisis, the Oracle
software contract debacle, the budget stalemate over a gargantuan
$24-billion shortfall, accusations of "pay-for-play" trade-offs of
campaign money for policy decisions.</TE>
<TE>   But luck wasn't through with Davis. Revelations that Enron and
other generators manipulated energy prices in California gave
credibility to Davis' charges that energy companies were the bad guys
all along. Questions surrounding the egregious, no-bid Oracle
contract have virtually disappeared from the political radar screen;
the administration has succeeded in extricating itself totally from
the controversial contract. Simon's attacks on Davis for his
aggressive--and sometimes questionable--fund-raising practices,
accusing the governor of fostering a "pay-to-play governing culture,"
may have lost potency when Simon got grief for a fine levied against
his family's firm as part of a New Jersey pay-to-play scandal.</TE>
<TE>   The budget crisis still hangs over the governor, but Simon's
ham-handed attempts to deflect demands that he release his tax
returns knocked Davis' failings off center stage. Last week, the GOP
challenger, after months of resistance, released his federal and
California tax returns. But Simon's conditions--a limited time for
viewing, no copies and no experts allowed--were reminiscent of the
strictures President Richard M. Nixon placed on his papers to make
access difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Simon has relaxed the strictures, but his handling of
the tax return issue has only served to raise more unfriendly
questions. For example, is something really bad buried in Simon's
returns? It's safe to say that Simon's klutziness has provided Davis'
campaign with a godsend of material for anti-Simon commercials.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' deluge of attack ads aimed at former Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan, the moderate front-runner in the GOP gubernatorial
primary, helped the governor secure an opponent he thought he could
demonize, as he did Lungren four years ago. Lungren, chewing the
scenery in televised debates, might have struck some as demonic, but
Simon looks more like a mild-mannered Clark Kent than a right-wing
Freddy Krueger.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the campaign, Simon wisely tried to keep the focus off
his conservative stances on social issues and on what he called
Davis' "gross mismanagement" of California. Simon sold himself as
"one of the leading businessmen in the state"--in contrast with the
career politician--with the "in-the-trenches business experience"
needed to right the ship of state.</TE>
<TE>   Oops. Voters' trust in corporate America has fallen with each new
post-Enron scandal, and the Simon people apparently have no Plan B.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the ice-king governor, who once haughtily pronounced it
was the Legislature's job to implement his vision, is reinventing
himself as "just a poor working stiff" who doesn't "have any tax
shelters."</TE>
<TE>   The governor's race is far from over, but Davis is getting the
breaks.</TE>
<TE>   Like Pat Brown, Davis could benefit from continuing GOP
internecine warfare.</TE>
<TE>   Like Wilson, Davis faces an underfunded, mistake-prone opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Like Jerry Brown, he has been able to manipulate the campaign
focus.</TE>
<TE>   And to do it, he's amassed more campaign cash than any
gubernatorial candidate in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, one political wag says, "Gray Davis could become
California's first '30-30' governor--winning reelection by 30 points
and with a 30% approval rating."</TE>
<TE>   The electoral math may be off, but anxious Californians,
dissatisfied with their candidate choices, may hold their noses and
vote for the devil they know.</TE>
<TE>   O, lucky man!</TE>

<AU>EHUD SPRINZAK and ROBERT J. LIEBER</AU>
<BD>Ehud Sprinzak is dean of the Lauder School of
Government, Diplomacy and Strategy at Interdisciplinary Center in
Herzilya, Israel. Robert J. Lieber is professor of government and
foreign service at Georgetown University.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Many critics of U.S. Mideast policy scold the Bush administration for
wanting to go after Saddam Hussein before progress toward an
Israeli-Palestinian peace is achieved. Yet there are compelling
reasons why these critics are 180-degrees wrong. Successfully moving
against the Iraqi president first, rather than later, would create
conditions for a new and more realistic peace process.</LD>
<LD>   There is little doubt that Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat is the major obstacle to Israeli-Palestinian peace. He is
simply incapable of making peace with the Israelis under almost any
conditions.</LD>
<LD>   But focusing on Arafat distracts attention from the powerful
forces that stand behind him and that sustain his intransigence--a
powerful post-Oslo Arab and Muslim rejectionist front that has never
been more influential.</LD>
<TE>   This front is made up of four camps: the traditional rejectionist
governments of Iraq, Syria and Libya; the Muslim government of Iran;
the jihadist movement and followers of Osama bin Laden; and the "Arab
street," which includes young Palestinian activists who hope that
suicidal violence will force Israel to withdraw from the West Bank,
as it did from Lebanon. Without the political and ideological support
of these forces and their unremitting anti-peace propaganda
throughout the Muslim world, Arafat could not resist the
international pressure to stop the suicide bombings and return to the
peace table. The rejectionist front, moreover, is the main reason why
relatively pragmatic rulers such as Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, Saudi
Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah and Jordan's King Abdullah II, who
mistrust Arafat at least as much as the Israelis, still pay homage to
his shaky leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein is the front's central figure. With the collapse of the
Taliban and Bin Laden's disappearance, the Iraqi leader remains the
great symbol of virulent anti-American, anti-Israeli and anti-peace
defiance. Unlike the hesitant Syrians and Libyans, he is unequivocal
about the need to destroy Israel, tomorrow if the Arabs would only
allow his troops to get to Israel's borders. Hussein, furthermore, is
the great financier of Palestinian suicide terrorism. Every family of
Palestinian shahid (martyr) receives between $10,000 and $25,000 from
him, an amount almost 10 times the average annual income of
Palestinians. True, Tehran's ayatollahs are as virulently anti-peace
and anti-Israel, and they are directly involved in arming Hezbollah
and the Palestinian Authority. But the Iranian regime faces
increasing domestic discontent, is less anti-American and is hardly
ready to back its anti-Zionist rhetoric with real action.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's removal from power and the fall of his regime would thus
be a devastating blow to the rejectionist front. It would immediately
change the balance of political and propaganda power in the Middle
East and the entire Muslim world. It would send an unequivocal
message to Syria, its Hezbollah ally in southern Lebanon and the
ayatollahs in Iran that the regional rejectionist party is over. It
would force jihadists and Bin Laden's remaining followers to
recognize that the destruction of the Taliban in Afghanistan was not
an isolated Western victory and that they are next in line. Finally,
it would signal the marginalization of Arafat and his extremist
supporters, even if this Palestinian arch-terrorist remains president
of the Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   To grasp the significance of a world without Hussein, it is
essential to understand why some Arab leaders opted to make peace
with Israel. President Anwar Sadat of Egypt and King Hussein of
Jordan did not suddenly convert to the ideas of Theodor Herzl, the
father of Zionism. Instead, they concluded that Israel was here to
stay, that it could not be defeated militarily and that perpetuating
the conflict with it was harming their societies. They made peace
with Israel because it was manifestly in their countries' interests
to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Subsequent Egyptian and Jordanian leaders continue to understand
this. Not the rejectionists. Counting on anti-Israeli propaganda, on
the electrifying impact of Palestinian suicide bombers on the Arab
psyche and on the sympathy of a few European governments, they have
convinced themselves that they can either stop the peace process or
fundamentally change its parameters.</TE>
<TE>   Removing Hussein from power would eliminate the most important
bastion of the rejectionist position, and while individual radical
leaders are unlikely to change their rhetoric overnight, their power,
as well as their ability to attract a larger following, would be
seriously diminished.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's ouster, the expected isolation of the Iranian regime and
the collapse of the entire rejectionist front would also dramatically
affect the Israeli government and Israeli public opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1991 Gulf War and the launching of the Iraqi Scud
missiles, Israel's leading strategists have believed that Hussein and
Tehran's ayatollahs, not the Palestinians, constitute the greatest
strategic danger to the Jewish state. The Israelis have taken this
threat so seriously that, in the last decade, they have quietly spent
billions of dollars to acquire second-strike capabilities to deter
Iraq and Iran from ever using nuclear, chemical or biological weapons
against their country. Arafat's association with these anti-Israeli
powers has prompted many Israelis to question the wisdom of trusting
the Palestinian leader and making far-reaching concessions to him.</TE>
<TE>   The collapse of the Iraqi-Iranian threat would be an enormous
relief to Israeli leaders. It follows that most of them would feel
more secure in making the necessary concessions for a viable peace
with the Palestinians. Israeli public opinion would probably support
these gestures with higher numbers than ever before.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to launch a massive war against Iraq involves serious
military, political and geostrategic questions. While the
administration's decision to topple Hussein is not without risk, the
risks of failing to act are almost certainly greater. But a concern
for the war's negative impact on the Israeli-Palestinian peace
problem is not one of these reasons.</TE>

<BD>Wendy Orent writes frequently on infectious disease and
is currently writing a book about plague.</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Those American scientists who know Gen. Pyotr Burgasov don't expect
much candor from him. Alexis Shelokov, a member of a U.S. scientific
team that, in 1992, investigated a mysterious 1979 outbreak of
anthrax in the then-Soviet Union city of Sverdlovsk, says the tall,
silver-haired former deputy minister of health was "easy, pleasant,
smiling, good to eat and drink with, a man who loved people and loved
life. He was very comfortable with lying." Burgasov denied--and still
denies--that the 68 people who died of inhalational anthrax in that
outbreak were victims of a bioweapons accident. He insists they ate
infected meat. But in a November 2001 interview in the Moscow News,
the affable Burgasov offered candid advice to terrorists. Anthrax
isn't worth much, he noted--it doesn't spread. "But smallpox--that's
a real biological weapon," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Burgasov then dropped a bomb of his own, one that is still
reverberating in the American corridors of power. "On Vozrazhdenie
Island in the Aral Sea, the strongest recipes of smallpox were
tested," he said. "Four hundred grams of smallpox formulation was
exploded on the island." At that same time in 1971, he continued, a
research vessel sailing on the Aral Sea passed within 15 kilometers
of the testing site. A young technician was on board taking samples
of plankton. The airborne smallpox "got her," in Burgasov's words,
and she fell ill after returning home to the town of Aralsk, where
she passed the infection on to her brother and other people. "I
called [Yuri] Andropov, who at that time was chief of KGB, and
informed him of the exclusive recipe of smallpox obtained on
Vozrazhdenie Island," Burgasov said.</TE>
<TE>   Burgasov's bomb took a long time to detonate. Dr. Ken Alibek,
former deputy director of Biopreparat, the Soviet biological-weapons
apparatus, reported on Burgasov's interview before the U.S. House
Committee on International Relations in December, but no one paid
attention. In April, however, the Center for Nonproliferation Studies
of the Monterey Institute of International Studies received the
original Soviet-era reports on the outbreak from Dr. Bakyt B.
Atshabar, director of the Kazakh Scientific Center of Almaty,
Kazakhstan. The report was sent to biodefense expert Alan P. Zelicoff
of Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, who also interviewed
two of the original patients in Kazakhstan by telephone and subjected
the data to rigorous statistical analysis. Zelicoff, a medical
doctor, presented his findings June 15 at a National Academy of
Sciences Institute of Medicine forum on smallpox vaccination, and
Burgasov's bomb exploded.</TE>
<TE>   The "exclusive recipe" of smallpox tested on Vozrazhdenie Island
produced no ordinary disease. The young technician who first fell ill
had been vaccinated. So had her brother, whom she infected when she
returned to Aralsk. Both suffered, as Zelicoff determined, severe
illness. And both were contagious. Although they survived, a young
woman who visited them did not. She died of hemorrhagic smallpox, the
most terrible form of the disease, which causes uncontrollable
bleeding and rapid death. Two infants also died of hemorrhagic
smallpox. None of the three had been vaccinated. The vaccinated
patients did not die, but they came down with moderately severe
disease.</TE>
<TE>   Before naturally occurring smallpox disappeared in 1978,
hemorrhagic smallpox was exceedingly rare--not more than 2.5% of all
smallpox cases took this form, which was most common in countries
such as India and Bangladesh, where crowded conditions allowed severe
disease to spread more easily. Yet in Kazakhstan, all three
nonvaccinated cases were hemorrhagic. The numbers are small but the
percentage is unnerving.</TE>
<TE>   Zelicoff's presentation provoked an instant uproar.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Donald A. Henderson, who directed the smallpox-eradication
campaign and who has long advocated destruction of the remaining
legitimate stores of the smallpox virus, immediately protested that,
since smallpox still occurred in nearby Afghanistan, the technician
may have caught the disease naturally at one of the several Central
Asian ports the ship visited. But the woman, though she made many
stops in the region, never visited Afghanistan, and no one who did
fell ill. Furthermore, Burgasov himself states that this was a
bioweapons incident. And former Soviet bioweapons scientist Sergei
Popov, who now works for Advanced Biosystems Inc., a biodefense firm
in Manassas, Va., says he had heard rumors of the Aralsk bioweapons
outbreak for years. Evidence suggests that we should take Burgasov at
his word.</TE>
<TE>   Zelicoff's analysis goes further: He suggests that the particular
so-called Aralsk strain must have been epidemiologically selected to
be as hot as possible, "the strongest recipe of smallpox," in
Burgasov's inimitable phrasing. A commentary on Zelicoff's analysis,
written by smallpox expert Dr. Peter B. Jahrling of the U.S. Medical
Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, puts it this way: "We know
that the Soviet bioweapons development program attempted to select
natural strains of increased virulence and that one of the selection
criteria was hemorrhagic diathesis in mice and embryonated eggs." In
other words, Soviet bioweaponeers deliberately tested strains of
smallpox to select those most likely to "go hemorrhagic."</TE>
<TE>   What does all this mean? Thirty years ago, Soviet scientists had
weaponized a smallpox strain probably far more lethal than most forms
of natural smallpox. We often hear that smallpox has a death rate of
30%, nothing like the 99% fatality rate of, say, untreated pneumonic
plague. But in fact this is only an average. Smallpox strains from
Africa killed about 10% of those infected, while the much hotter
strains of India and Bangladesh killed many more, close to 50%.</TE>
<TE>   Alibek, the former Soviet biological weapons official, has stated
that the Soviets deliberately selected an especially lethal strain
from India, the so-called India 1, as the basis for their smallpox
bioweapon. Was the "exclusive recipe" from Aralsk the same as India
1? Possibly--but if not, then India 1 might be worse. And we do not
know which strains may be in the hands of rogue nations.</TE>
<TE>   A number of American scientists, including Zelicoff, have asked
the Russian scientists at the Vector Laboratories of Novosibirsk,
keepers of the Russian-held World Health Organization smallpox
repository, to locate and turn over the Aralsk strain for joint
collaborative study. Vector scientists deny knowledge of the strain
or even the incident. This strikes some observers as implausible,
though Vector did not exist in 1971, and its director and chief
smallpox expert, Lev Sandakhchiev, was working on acetabularia, a
form of giant algae, at the time. If Vector has the strain, however,
it's unlikely the lab would be able to hand it over on its own. "Such
a decision would have to be made at the highest levels of the Russian
government," Alibek says. Meanwhile, a formal request for India 1 and
other smallpox strains from the Vector repository has yet to be made
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Without
that formal request, says a knowledgeable official, the Russian
scientists cannot issue an export license.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't likely, therefore, that we'll soon understand the precise
properties of the Aralsk strain, or India 1 for that matter. But we
should be better prepared to face the smallpox threat than we are.
The government should permit the American people to choose to be
vaccinated now. A freshly vaccinated population--excluding the very
young, those with major skin disorders and people with seriously
compromised immune systems--could well deter a smallpox strike in the
first place. Why waste effort trying to infect a vaccinated
population?</TE>
<TE>   Even if an attack occurred, widespread vaccination would minimize
death and social disruption. Furthermore, the ongoing research by
Jahrling and his team into less dangerous vaccines and better
antiviral drugs to treat smallpox after infection should become a top
priority of the CDC and the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   Now we know, thanks to Zelicoff's efforts and Burgasov's candor,
what weaponized smallpox strains can do. But if the event at Aralsk
was the devil's fingertip, what would the whole hand be like?</TE>
<TE>   We should take steps to ensure we never find out.</TE>

of our current financial crisis</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN PHILLIPS</AU>
<BD>Kevin Phillips' new book, "Wealth and Democracy: A
Political History of the American Rich," was published in May.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>All last year and well into this one, Americans dismissed the bear
market in stocks as little more than a playful and frisky cub pawing
through the picnic litter. Only in the last 10 weeks have people
begun to see him as an angry 800-pound grizzly, capable of lacerating
national economic hopes and individual portfolios alike.</LD>
<LD>   The trouble, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, is that this
belated-realism stage is not the end. It is not necessarily even the
beginning of the end. Finally taking the bear seriously--along with
pondering the lessons of 1929, the Japanese doldrums and all the
other financial crises that preceded it--may only be the end of the
beginning, with a larger financial crisis still to unfold.</LD>
<LD>   Washington leadership itself calls up unhappy precedents. The Bush
administration, with its second-rate economic advisors and its
cheerleader mentality, is caught in a maelstrom it can't understand.
Under the strain, it has begun to show unnerving resemblances to the
ineffectual Hoover team of 70 years ago. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan, whose place in economic history is also teetering,
has few stimulative weapons left and seems to be worried about the
United States having a decade of doldrums like the one that Japan
experienced after its stock market crash in the early 1990s.</LD>
<TE>   It's also possible that the economic recovery that began in the
fourth quarter of 2001 will wind down this autumn or winter as the
fiscal and monetary stimulus that was pumped into the economy after
Sept. 11 wears off. Beleaguered stock owners and overextended
consumers could snap their wallets and checkbooks shut.</TE>
<TE>   My guess is that we are halfway through a three-stage financial
crisis. Over the course of the '80s and '90s, the finance, insurance
and real estate sector of the economy grew so notably that it moved
ahead of the manufacturing sector in the gross domestic product
numbers. We are now being tossed by the wake of its over-ambition.
Indeed, given the way finance and technology teamed to create the
recent tech stock bubble, one can argue that boom-and-bust was a
product of finance as much as of technology.</TE>
<TE>   Much of our current crisis of confidence in corporations and the
legitimacy of their stock prices also derives from the
financialization of business--dishonest accounting, faked earnings,
derivatives, off-the-books partnerships, run-amok stock
options--rather than the old corporate bugaboos of price-fixing,
polluting, bribery and restraint of trade. The big corporate crimes
and transgressions now have little to do with a company's product:
They are financial, with chief financial officers the frequent
masterminds. The United States has become a financial society.</TE>
<TE>   If the first stage of the financial crisis, in 2000 and 2001, was
bubble-related, the second stage, in 2002, is about the integrity of
financial markets, institutions and valuations in the aftermath of
two decades of mammoth expansions and hubris. The large investment
firms of Wall Street earlier pressured corporations into looking at
quarterly earnings as an end in themselves and, more recently,
fleeced investors with corrupt stock research and ratings. Too many
accounting firms, in turn, played along with corporate financial
gimmickry for high consulting fees. Big banks like Citigroup and J.P.
Morgan Chase, it now appears, helped the Enrons and other hungry
raptors to set up financial flimflams. Enron shareholders are now
suing nine of the big banking and investment conglomerates.</TE>
<TE>   Out of this warped financialization have come competitions between
huge industries like telecommunications and energy over who can stage
the world's biggest bankruptcies--first Enron, now WorldCom--and the
destruction of hundreds of billions in stock and bond market
capitalization as phony profits evaporate and Wall Street "buy"
ratings implode.</TE>
<TE>   Finance, too, is reeling as congressional hearings multiply and
mutual-fund assets shrivel. Between 1980 and 2000, mutual-fund assets
rose from $138 billion to $7.8 trillion as the stock market soared.
Since 2000, however, the total value of U.S. stocks, as measured by
the Wilshire 5000 Index, has fallen from a peak of more than $14
trillion to $7 trillion to $8 trillion.</TE>
<TE>   There is absolutely no precedent for measuring what effect this
crash--the largest assets collapse in history--will have on the U.S.
economy and consumers. Straight dollar comparisons with the 1929
crash are meaningless because of inflation. However, as a percentage
of U.S. gross domestic product, the loss of equity wealth between
2000 and 2002 is somewhat higher than during the same period after
1929. This time, however, more of the loss has hit the middle class.
Thank you again, financialization.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us to a related point. The U.S. has been one of the
world's most speculative economies, and each great new industry
coming of age--railroads and steel in the 19th century, autos,
aviation, radio and electric utilities in the 1920s--has had bubbles
that turned into brutal crashes. In the major crashes of those eras,
finance was only an accomplice, a facilitator lacking the heft of a
major share in the real economy of the GDP.</TE>
<TE>   Not anymore. Which means that stage three of the financial crisis
could well conjoin a negative wealth effect--worried investors and
consumers cocooning for a cold winter--with a further downward lurch
in the stock markets as mutual funds and the U.S. economy contract
later this year or early next. If so, it could bring the financial
industry's own sectorial bloodbath, already beginning to be visible
in bank stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The experts dismissing this have argued that the economy is in a
reasonably strong recovery from the brief recession of 2001. They
discount both the drag on the economy of stock losses and the notion
that the present recovery relied on post-9/11 stimuli that are
lessening. They also reject any parallels to 1929-32 or to Japan
after its 1990 stock market collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Analogies, of course, must be taken with a grain of salt. History
repeats only in outline, not detail. However, the probability is that
the U.S. stock market collapse and economic disruption of 2000-2002
is at least a cousin of the U.S. downturn of 1929-32 and of the
Japanese debacle now in its 12th year. A speedy "normal recovery" is
unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   Politics are likewise uncertain. The Bush administration, with its
economic happy talk, excessive corporate influence and unwillingness
to grapple with a serious new federal regulatory role, bears a
resemblance to the GOP of the '20s. Like the unlucky Herbert Hoover,
George W. prefers business self-regulation and volunteerism, which
will prove inadequate if the crisis deepens.</TE>
<TE>   However, in contrast to Hoover and his vice president, who were
themselves free of any corporate scandal, Bush and Vice President
Dick Cheney, both ex-CEOs of energy companies, have strong corporate
biases and connections, leaving them wide open to charges of
unethical behavior and cronyism. This adds to public disbelief and
loss of confidence in the nation's institutions.</TE>
<TE>   If the stock market crash of 2000-2002 spreads into the real
economy, triggering another downturn, the perception of Bush as
corporate insider would intensify, and he could be crippled by loss
of personal credibility as well as by Democratic control of Congress.
A divided government in Washington during 2003-2004 could stand in
the way of economic solutions, as it did in 1931-1932, when partisan
parity in Congress produced deadlock with the Republican
administration.</TE>
<TE>   The fallibilities of Greenspan and the Federal Reserve also
suggest that we are in the middle of an unusual crisis, not an
everyday business cycle. History's record is that while central banks
have played roles in bringing about stock market bubbles and crashes,
they have enjoyed less success in overcoming the major downturns once
they happen. They have been part of the problem more often than part
of the solution.</TE>
<TE>   In the Mississippi bubble of 1720, the first of the modern line,
the Bank of France was heavily involved. In the British railroad
crash of the 1840s, belief in the omnipotence of the Bank of England
helped swell the great bubble to bursting.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. boom-and-bust of the 1920s was partly linked to faith in
the brand new Federal Reserve Board, which pumped up the bubble in
1925 and 1927 but then refused to help in the depths of 1931 and
1932. The Japanese stock market crash of 1990-92 came after the Bank
of Japan had lubricated the stock bubble for several years and then
popped it with rate hikes. No wonder the Greenspan Fed is reading up
on the Japanese analogy.</TE>
<TE>   Economic history, to be sure, does not have much to tell us about
the next week or month. It's easy to imagine more brief stock market
upsurges in a badly oversold market. But over the next six months or
year, the odds are that the downturn will spread to the consumer--and
to the hubris-driven financial sector itself.</TE>

<AU>WILLIAM SCHNEIDER</AU>
<BD>William Schneider, a contributing editor to Opinion, is
a CNN political analyst.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The prospect of being hanged concentrates the mind wonderfully, Dr.
Samuel Johnson once observed. So does the prospect of being defeated.
Which is why you find a wonderful concentration of minds among
congressional Republicans these days. They're in a panic. Very much
like investors, but for a slightly different reason. Investors are
worried that they won't be able to retire early. Republicans are
worried that they'll be forced to retire early. Shortly after this
year's midterm election, in fact.</LD>
<LD>   So, what are congressional Republicans doing? The same thing a
terrified crew does when it realizes the ship is sinking: They're
throwing ballast overboard to keep the vessel afloat. "The mood of
the [Republican] conference is, 'Let's get on with this thing. Let's
not dillydally,' " Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert (R-N.Y.) said. "We've
got to do everything possible in short order to indicate to the
American people we're on top of these issues and we're doing
everything possible to restore confidence in the markets."</LD>
<TE>   What about the party's long-standing commitment to big business?
Overboard! Kersplash! Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of
the Energy and Commerce Committee, pressured House Republicans to
take a hard line on accounting fraud. "Investor confidence is at a
low, and the stock market is still going through this awful roller
coaster," Tauzin said. "We've got to put a stop to it."</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the spectacle of Rep. William M. Thomas
(R-Bakersfield), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,
advocating stronger enforcement powers for the Internal Revenue
Service against companies that create dubious tax shelters. And
introducing a bill to stop companies from relocating to Bermuda to
avoid U.S. taxes. This, from one of business' best friends in
Congress, a man who received the "Spirit of Enterprise" award from
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 40 House Republicans signed a letter urging their
colleagues to accept the Senate bill sponsored by Sen. Paul S.
Sarbanes (D-Md.), which contains far-reaching corporate regulations.
A new independent board to oversee corporate audits. New categories
of corporate crimes. New grounds for lawsuits against companies that
deceive investors. The sorts of things House Republicans would have
rejected out of hand a few weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   The WorldCom bankruptcy and the stock market slide changed all
that. Last week, House negotiators signed off on the Sarbanes bill
with a few changes. The House quickly voted 423 to 3 to pass it, then
the Senate voted 99 to 0 to send it to the president's desk. Let's
get this straight: Republicans agree to pass tough new regulations on
business, and the stock market soars. There's an irony in there
somewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to look out for ourselves first and foremost," a top
House Republican strategist told the Washington Post. "We have to go
home in a week and say we've done something. People have to wake up
and realize the political nature of this fight."</TE>
<TE>   In a report distributed on Capitol Hill, a prominent Republican
polling firm found that "the bottom has fallen out on the mood of the
country." In the pollsters' view, "WorldCom's [bankruptcy]
announcement may have been the straw that broke the camel's back." It
certainly broke the stock market's back. "Voters' attitudes toward
corporate offenders are hostile," the report warned. "Legislation
punishing wrongdoers can't be too tough."</TE>
<TE>   It is politically impossible to defend big business right now. Not
even George W. Bush can do it. The president went to Wall Street to
denounce "corporate abusers" and to call for an end to corporate
wrongdoing--including practices he once engaged in. "I challenge
compensation committees to put an end to all company loans to
corporate officers," the president said. Presumably like the ones he
once got at Harken Energy.</TE>
<TE>   The culture has shifted from business heroes in the 1990s (Bill
Gates) to what Theodore Roosevelt called "malefactors of great
wealth." That puts Bush in an awkward position. How many business
executives have been elected president? Answer: two. Both of them
were named Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The corporate crime wave also put conservatives in an awkward
position. Isn't support for business a core element of the
conservative faith?</TE>
<TE>   Actually, no. The core element of the conservative faith is
opposition to government. Business usually shares that sentiment, so
conservatives and business have been long-standing allies. But it's
an alliance of convenience. And money.</TE>
<TE>   For business, politics isn't about causes. It's about interests.
That's why conservatives distrust big business. The two work together
when they have the same interests--say, to pass a tax cut or to
defeat environmentalists on oil drilling. But conservatives suspect
that business is always ready to sell them out. And they're right.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Republicans still get most of their money from big business.
But so do Democrats. Under President Clinton, Democrats repudiated
their anti-business image. In fact, you could say that business made
out like bandits during the Clinton era. Literally. And business
played it safe by giving money to both parties. Remember the White
House coffees? The Lincoln Bedroom overnight stays?</TE>
<TE>   The legacy of the Clinton era is that economic differences between
the parties have shrunk, while values differences have grown.</TE>
<TE>   The "red state-blue state" division of the country on election
night 2000 was over values: conservative America versus liberal
America. Economic issues were less important. The economy made Al
Gore the winner of the popular vote. Values made Bush the winner of
the election. The economic issue has drawn Democrats closer to
business. At the same time, the values issue has pulled Republicans
away from business. Conservatives feel betrayed by the corrupt
behavior of business executives. The GOP has taken on a powerful
strain of moralism since 1980. Conservatives used to see business as
amoral. Now they see business as immoral.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans are facing real problems in the midterm election this
November.</TE>
<TE>   The problems are not immediately apparent in the polls, which
still show a close split between Democrats and Republicans across the
country. The problem is one of motivation.</TE>
<TE>   "If the negative mood of the country is sustained over the next
few months, look for GOP turnout problems," the Republican pollsters
warn in their report.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats are angry over the corporate scandals. And angry voters
dominate midterm elections, which most people don't bother with.
Angry white men brought the Republicans to power in 1994. Angry
Democrats came out to protect President Clinton in 1998, when he was
threatened with impeachment. After eight years of steadily losing
ground, the Republican House majority could be swept away by a wave
of Democratic anger in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans know they can't rely on Bush to save them, even though
he has sky-high job-approval ratings. Bush's standing is above
politics. When people say they support the president, it's an
expression of national solidarity at a time of threat. It doesn't
mean much for his party. It is certainly odd for a president to be
coasting along with a 70% approval rating, as he is in this month's
New York Times-CBS News poll, while only about half that
number--36%--say they intend to vote Republican for Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has enormous credibility on issues like terrorism and
national security. He has less credibility on the issues that are
likely to drive the midterm election--corporate responsibility,
investor confidence and the economy. Most Americans do not think Bush
is corrupt. They worry that he's clueless--that he has no idea what
to do about the stock market or the economy. It's the same way people
felt about his father in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats have the advantage on the issue of corporate
responsibility. The New York Times-CBS News poll asked people whether
they thought the Democratic Party was more committed to protecting
the interests of ordinary Americans or of large corporations. By 52%
to 31%, people said Democrats favored ordinary Americans. By 58% to
29%, they said Republicans favored large corporations. Whose side is
Bush on? The public is split: 42% say he favors ordinary Americans,
42% say he favors large corporations.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Republicans figured out that the smartest thing they
could do was simply to say, "OK, we'll go along with the Democrats on
corporate responsibility. Support the Senate bill. Make it even
tougher. Stop defending big business." There are times in politics
when the wisest thing to do is to say, "Me too." Democrats did it in
the war on terrorism, and it didn't hurt them one bit.</TE>

<AU>JAY TAYLOR</AU>
<BD>Jay Taylor, a former Marine, was a deputy secretary of
State for intelligence and research in the Reagan administration. He
is currently writing a biography of Chiang Kai-shek.</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Va.</DL>
<LD>The first phase of our military involvement in Afghanistan had a
clear-cut purpose: toppling the Taliban. But with that mission
accomplished, American-led military operations in Afghanistan are now
doing more harm than good.</LD>
<LD>   First, there's the issue of civilian casualties. Speaking to
reporters at a base north of Kabul on July 15, Deputy Defense
Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz voiced his regrets about the killing of
48 civilians--including a number of children--in a July 1 U.S. air
attack on a village in the Deh Rawod district of Uruzgan province.
But, he said, "bad things happen in combat zones," and we should have
"no regrets about going after bad guys." Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld issued a similar nonapology at the Pentagon on July 22. "If
a mistake was made," he said, "a mistake was made, but it was made
with our people on the ground with eyes on the target."</LD>
<LD>   The way we went after the "bad guys" in the July 1 incident was to
unload the massive and indiscriminate firepower of an AC-130 gunship
on a village from which a bombing crew saw, or believed it saw, fire
directed at the plane. Rumsfeld said he saw a video of the attack and
"clearly there was ground fire," but he could not say what type of
weapons were in use on the ground.</LD>
<TE>   In the end, no antiaircraft shells or equipment was found by
American troops searching the remains of the village, which would be
consistent with the villagers' assertion that they were firing rifles
to celebrate a wedding. But even assuming that people on the ground
were deliberately firing on the AC-130, responding by bombarding a
village with what must have been close to half a ton of bullets,
shells and shrapnel is indefensible. It's as if police here shot
indiscriminately into a crowd at a mall because someone in the crowd
had fired a gun. The use of such lethal weapons is morally acceptable
against organized military units in a full-scale war, but it is
indefensible against villages in an anti-guerrilla campaign. This
incident calls to mind the futile destruction of Vietnamese hamlets
by U.S. forces "in order to save them."</TE>
<TE>   In Indochina, we lost our sense of proportion in weighing the
effects of destructive firepower against the likely military gains.
The same seems to be happening in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   By mid-December of last year, the Taliban and Al Qaeda military
organizations had been smashed, and we had recovered for intelligence
purposes whatever useful material had been left behind. Judging by
media reports, in the operations since then American forces have
accidentally killed more than 200 Afghan civilians, a number Rumsfeld
dismisses as being small by historical standards. If these civilian
casualties had occurred during the real war, lasting from October to
December, he might have a valid case. Certainly by Vietnam standards,
the numbers are small. But judging from media interviews with U.S.
soldiers and pro-government Afghan commanders in the field, the
Americans have killed only a small number of terrorists and other
enemy allies this year--perhaps even fewer than the 200 civilians
killed.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the problem with civilian casualties, the Pentagon gives
virtually no hard data to support its claims that its ongoing
operations are accomplishing much beyond finding arms caches. As was
reported last week, there has not been a major engagement with
Taliban or Al Qaeda forces since March. The previous commander of
coalition forces in the country, Maj. Gen. Franklin L. Hagenbeck,
said the bulk of Al Qaeda and its leadership was no longer in
Afghanistan. Canadian, British and Australian troops involved in the
continuing American-led search-and-destroy operations this year
report frankly that they have not killed or captured one terrorist.
The Canadians, having lost four soldiers to a mistaken attack by a
U.S. F-16 jet, recently went home. The British are also packing up.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban army and its Al Qaeda allies were crushed without the
involvement of any significant American ground forces. Yet for some
reason American rather than Afghan forces now carry out most of the
ongoing ground combat operations in what is clearly a mopping-up
phase of the conflict. Wolfowitz praised the U.S. military campaign
in Afghanistan as "amazing" and "remarkable." This assessment is
certainly valid if applied only to last year's air war, but it
doesn't describe operations since. As happened in South Vietnam, the
government in Kabul--critically dependent on American aid--has
refrained from criticizing U.S. tactics. President Hamid Karzai has
"temporarily" replaced his bodyguards with American troops. After the
July 1 attack, six provincial leaders demanded that U.S. troops get
permission from them before conducting operations in their areas. But
in a July 17 meeting, three of the leaders changed their minds,
apparently at the urging of Ahmed Wali Karzai, the president's
brother and special envoy. Last week the plan's author, Gov. Gul Agha
Sherzai, denounced his original demand as a "mistranslation" and
claimed he had asked only for U.S. consultation on military actions.
The American and the Afghan people deserve a detailed explanation of
what has been achieved by U.S. military operations over the last six
months and how many civilian casualties those achievements have
caused. Stung by the Vietnam experience, the Pentagon no longer
issues a "body count" estimating the number of enemy killed in
action. But surely there are such estimates from field commanders.
Aside from the eight Americans killed in a skirmish during Operation
Anaconda, only two other Americans have been killed by enemy fire
this year. Is an Afghan civilian death rate of 20 times that number
at the hands of our military really acceptable?</TE>

<AU>DAVID WISE</AU>
<BD>David Wise is the author of "The Spy Who Got Away" and
of "Spy: The Inside Story of How the FBI's Robert Hanssen Betrayed
America," to be published in October.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In the gathering dusk of a cold, wet September day, we were sitting
on the rear covered balcony of Edward Lee Howard's dacha near Moscow
when he finally told me the truth, or some of it.</LD>
<LD>   I thought of that afternoon with a spy a decade ago when reports
out of Moscow last week said that Howard had died of a broken neck in
a fall in that dacha on July 12. I immediately thought of the steep
staircase that led up to a small loft overlooking the spacious living
room, the loft where the former CIA officer had a desk, a pale-yellow
telephone, a fax machine and a Toshiba laptop. If he did fall, I
thought, it must have been on that stairway.</LD>
<TE>   Howard was 50 when he died. In 1985, accused of being a spy for
the KGB, he said goodbye to his 2-year-old son, Lee, and escaped from
the FBI in Santa Fe, N.M., using the skills he had learned in the
CIA. His wife, Mary, was at the wheel of their car that night as he
propped up a dummy he had fashioned from a broomstick, a wig and a
Calvin Klein field jacket and jumped out as she slowed down rounding
a curve. The ruse was designed to lull a tail into thinking Howard
was still in the car. In fact, because a young FBI agent on
surveillance duty had missed seeing the couple leave their house,
bureau agents were not following Howard. Still, the spy trick was
useful, because when Mary Howard drove back into their garage, in the
dark it looked to the FBI agent on duty as though Howard was in the
passenger seat. But he was on his way to Moscow, using, he told me
later, his TWA Getaway card. Although Mary Howard had helped him
escape, she cooperated with the FBI. She and Howard were later
divorced.</TE>
<TE>   Howard was the only known CIA officer to defect to the Russians.
He was all set to go to Moscow for the CIA in 1983 when he failed a
polygraph test and was fired. Angry, he contacted the KGB and sold
information that severely damaged the agency's operations in the
Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   The path that led me to the dacha in Zhukovka, an hour outside
Moscow, had begun in Budapest in 1987, when I met Howard on an island
in the Danube and interviewed him over several days for a book I
wrote about the case, "The Spy Who Got Away."</TE>
<TE>   In Moscow four years later, I called the ex-CIA man. Over lunch at
his favorite Georgian restaurant, he said: "I'm a recovering
alcoholic. It's very hard to deal with here. This is a country where
people encourage you to drink."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, we walked along a peaceful lake to the Novodevichy
monastery, where former Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev is buried.
Howard invited me to come for lunch at the dacha the next weekend. On
Sunday, he called for me at my hotel in a KGB car, driven by a thin,
blond man named Kolya, one of his bodyguards. "I have 24-hour
security," Howard said.</TE>
<TE>   En route to the dacha we passed a large apartment building.
"That's Tolkachev's house," Howard said, pointing. Adolf G. Tolkachev
was a Russian defense researcher who had spied for the CIA. Howard
told that to the KGB, and Tolkachev was executed. As we passed the
building, I may have remarked that Tolkachev did not live there
anymore. There was silence for a moment. Then Howard said: "I didn't
bust him, David. I know I didn't bust him." But Howard also betrayed
at least two other CIA assets, Vladimir Vasilyev, a GRU colonel, who
was executed, and Boris Yuzhin, a KGB officer, who went to prison.
All three were also betrayed by Aldrich Ames, the CIA officer who had
begun spying for the KGB five months before Howard escaped.</TE>
<TE>   As we were waved past the guardhouse at Zhukovka, Howard said,
"It's a KGB town. The whole place is a KGB town." And, in fact, many
of the residents, although not all, did work for the Soviet spy
agency.</TE>
<TE>   Soon we drove through a high, green wooden gate and were at the
dacha, a modern, five-room, red-brick building with a garden in the
front and a small cottage where the couple who served as Howard's
caretaker and cook lived. The balcony at the back of the dacha
overlooked a garden thick with birch trees and roses. In the rear was
a guardhouse where two bodyguards slept. The property was surrounded
by a 10-foot-high wooden fence that Howard said was topped by a laser
security system.</TE>
<TE>   Ostensibly, all this was to protect Howard from the CIA's long
arm, but it was apparent that he was a spy in a gilded cage. It
seemed clear to me that the KGB security was there as much to watch
him as to keep anyone else out.</TE>
<TE>   Lunch was fairly elaborate, the zakuski already on the table,
crabmeat salad--the crab was flown in from Vladivostok, he
said--fresh tomatoes, pickles, salami, other cold meats and coleslaw.
Then a sort of mystery meat, a Salisbury steak with potatoes, and
tea. Howard, who had clearly been drinking even before he arrived at
the hotel to pick me up, did not make it through the lunch. He lay
down on the couch in the living room and fell asleep. Anna Ivanova,
the cook, gently unlaced and removed his running shoes.</TE>
<TE>   I read a book. After two hours, he got up and we went out on the
balcony and sat in the cold, damp air, waiting for the KGB car that
was supposed to return for me at 6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Howard was speaking very softly. "I'm a lost man," he said,
staring at the birch trees. He turned to me. "So you've got to be
nice to me."</TE>
<TE>   I asked him why he had done it. He started to answer, but never
did. Still, he went further than he ever had before.</TE>
<TE>   "They called me," he said. "It was an international call. They
found me. They had gone through a lot of phone books. I was so
scared." And what did "they" say? I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Come to us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   I heard the car. Under the floodlights out front, in the light
rain, Sasha and Volodya, his bodyguards, were lined up in formal
fashion in the driveway. Howard had put on a black leather jacket to
see me off. I said goodbye and got in the car. As I looked back at
him, standing there in the rain, it struck me that with his dark
hair, in his black leather jacket, Edward Lee Howard looked for all
the world like a Russian.</TE>

<HD>State Law Prohibits Targeting Sex Offenders</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: We live in a common interest development in Southern
California. We have three children younger than 5.</LD>
<LD>   We have just learned that the ill-tempered man living next door to
us for the last six years is a convicted pedophile. He also sits on
our homeowner association board.</LD>
<LD>   We want to put a sign out that states: "Pedophiles need not
purchase here!" We also want to plaster his picture and name all over
our complex and have him removed as a board member. Can we do this
without being sued?</LD>
<TE>   Answer: The Davis-Stirling Act says nothing of having the right to
remove a person from the board because he is a sex offender. In fact,
it makes no mention of requirements or special skills as a
prerequisite of sitting on a homeowner association board of
directors.</TE>
<TE>   The California courts have ruled that you cannot plaster his name
and picture all over your complex without being sued.</TE>
<TE>   Penal Code Section 290.4, added in 1994 and amended in 1996 and
1997, is California's version of Megan's Law. That section provides
for the collection and disclosure of information on persons required
to register as sex offenders.</TE>
<TE>   Section 290.4 allows limited public access to sex offender
registration information through a 900 telephone number and a CD-ROM
database available for viewing at your local police or sheriff's
station.</TE>
<TE>   When the law was passed, the state Legislature also said that in
making information available about sex offenders to the public, it
did not intend that the information be used to inflict retribution or
additional punishment on any such person convicted of a sexual
offense.</TE>
<TE>   Use of the information is limited to protecting a person at risk,
such as your children, and to letting people in the area know that a
registered sex offender was also living in the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The statute provides an array of penalties for misuse of the
information obtained.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, persons who use the information to commit a crime are
subject to additional criminal penalties.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the only disclosure of the information is in accordance
with limits set out by the law enforcement agency with which the
offender is registered.</TE>
<TE>   Ownership in a common interest development does not allow you to
exclude any other owner based on their background, religion, race,
sex or profession, just as you could not prevent someone from buying
because he is a convicted pedophile.</TE>
<TE>   As for getting the pedophile neighbor off the board, you would
have to follow the procedures in your governing documents, which
likely say something to the effect that you cannot summarily dismiss
an individual from your board.</TE>
<TE>   If he was elected, he serves until he is removed, resigns, dies or
a replacement is elected at an election called for that purpose.</TE>
<TE>   Putting out signs that discourage pedophiles does nothing to make
your complex secure. Your complex is only as secure as your
association makes it, either by hiring security or creating your own
association security.</TE>
<TE>   You and your board are cautioned against taking any of the steps
you mention because you may be sued for such actions.</TE>

<DH>A name architect? A famous resident? History has become a
marketing tool as sellers find value in a place with a past.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLEE KOMAIKO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"In most of California, brand new is very important," said Doug
Drummond, an agent with Coldwell Banker La Canada Flintridge. "But
there is a clientele that really enjoys the history of a home."</LD>
<LD>   In some instances, buyers may even be willing to pay a premium for
a home with historic significance. At the least, Drummond said, a
compelling history "enhances a buyer's good feeling about the house."</LD>
<LD>   Realtors are responding by making history a part of their
marketing, and not just with grand estates but with more modest
properties as well.</LD>
<TE>   The practice isn't altogether new. For years, savvy Realtors have
included the names of such well-known architects as Paul Williams in
their listings. Williams designed dozens of mostly traditional homes
throughout Los Angeles as well as co-designing the Theme Building at
LAX.</TE>
<TE>   But the practice is becoming more common as the number of buyers,
sellers and agents interested in such things grows.</TE>
<TE>   "History works for the buyer and the seller," said Boyd Smith of
Coldwell Banker Pasadena. "It provides a past and a present. For the
seller, it helps position the product."</TE>
<TE>   Knowing a property's history also helps Smith do his job better.</TE>
<TE>   "In our business, what we're really selling is information. It's
pretty obvious to say, 'Here's the living room.' " But being able to
tell people that a famous diva sang regularly in that living room or
an important city leader commissioned the home is something else.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost as if you're a docent or a tour guide," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   How much a good history is worth is hard to quantify. Let's just
say some histories are richer than others.</TE>
<TE>   According to Steve Haussler of Coldwell Banker Pasadena, "A house
by a name architect who is nationally famous can get up to 25% or
more [over what it would otherwise]."</TE>
<TE>   "People seek out Wallace Neff and Paul Williams houses," said Jan
Eric Horn, executive director of the Architectural Division of
Coldwell Banker. The same goes for homes by Greene and Greene and
Richard Neutra.</TE>
<TE>   "I have five agents a day calling to say, 'Do you have something
by this architect or in this style?' " Horn said. "In Pasadena, if
you have a house designed by Wallace Neff, Myron Hunt, Reginald
Johnson, Bertram Goodhue or Carlton Winslow, people will clamor to
see those."</TE>
<TE>   Palm Springs mid-century homes by Albert Frey are especially hot
right now, Horn said. "If they come on the market, they go in two
seconds."</TE>
<TE>   A former celebrity owner can also add appeal to a home, but rarely
does this factor increase sales price. For one thing, Horn said, "in
this town people are used to celebrities."</TE>
<TE>   "Often high-end buyers have no interest in purchasing a home owned
by a celebrity because they know they'll have looky-loos," Horn said.</TE>
<TE>   Take Madonna's former homes. "They have not brought a premium,"
Horn said, "because the tour buses are always around."</TE>
<TE>   There are exceptions. Horn recalled a property listed several
years ago by a colleague. "It was owned by David Geffen, and the
woman who ended up buying it was a famous music writer. She paid a
huge amount over market because of that [industry] connection."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Catie Snider of Prudential John Aaroe Pasadena and her
partner, Michael Darling, brokered a deal on an 1895 Federal
Colonial-style three-story home in the San Pasqual neighborhood of
Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   "It was originally commissioned by a physician who was also a
gentleman citrus farmer," she said. That information, included in the
marketing materials, "became part of the cachet of the home."</TE>
<TE>   A surgeon ended up buying the house. The history, Snider said,
played into his and his wife's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "They liked the fact that its original inhabitant had been a local
physician," Snider said. "They were kind of carrying on that
tradition."</TE>
<TE>   Another "warm fuzzy," to borrow a usage from Haussler, is when a
house has been written about. When Haussler listed an unusual
Altadena property--actually two cottages and a studio surrounded by a
lush garden--he created a flier featuring passages from a 1978 New
Yorker article written about the house by poet Hilegarde Flanner,
whose mother purchased it in the 1920s.</TE>
<TE>   "An old-fashioned and romantic air of seclusion," Flanner wrote,
"almost of secrecy."</TE>
<TE>   "It really sucked people into the moment," Haussler said. "I don't
think it increased the sales price. What it increased was the love
affair."</TE>
<TE>   Tory Howe can relate. When she and her husband walked into a 1927
home by the Pasadena-based architectural team of Marston &amp; Maybury,
listed by Smith, they were immediately seduced by the architectural
elements.</TE>
<TE>   The two spreads on the house from popular home magazines of the
1930s that were sitting on the dining room table made the package
that much more enticing, as did the first bills for the house, also
on display.</TE>
<TE>   "That appealed to me," Howe said. "It's like being a collector.
I've always loved history anyway. Ironically, this home was built by
a very good friend of my grandfather."</TE>
<TE>   The Howes ended up purchasing the home. "My grandfather probably
had dinner here many times," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Sellers are often a rich source of home histories, but some agents
do research themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Haussler has gotten information from Pasadena Heritage and
Altadena Heritage. Horn has a library of hundreds of books on
architecture, period homes and movie stars' homes, and named the
Screen Actors Guild, UCLA and UC Santa Barbara as good sources of
archival material.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena-based historian Tim Gregory, a.k.a. the Building
Biographer, has done work for more than a hundred Los Angeles-area
real estate agents, many based in and around Pasadena. He also works
directly with homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   In the current market climate, in which anything with a roof and a
front door is selling at a premium, one might think Gregory's
services would be less in demand. But he's busier than ever,
researching what he calls "social histories" of area homes.</TE>
<TE>   The histories, which cost from $250 to $500, can include
architectural and building information for the life of the property,
biographies of the original and subsequent owners, stories about the
neighborhood and all sorts of intriguing miscellanea.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line," Gregory said, "is it gives the house an
identity and a personality."</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of agents won't spend the money to have someone do that,"
Smith said. "I think that's shortsighted. I think you owe it to the
seller. Even when something sells in one day, it needs to be well
packaged on that day."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Snider added, "if you get enough history, you can
probably change the price point by engendering more interest."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Gregory doesn't always turn up welcome information in
his research.</TE>
<TE>   There are murders, suicides and ghost tales, which, needless to
say, do not end up in the marketing material.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times what I have to do is burst bubbles," Gregory said.
"People harbor myths about who lived in a house or who designed it."</TE>
<TE>   Other times, Gregory finds the equivalent of a pot of gold.</TE>
<TE>   "Just last week I discovered a house was designed by Paul
Williams," he said. "The owners had no idea. I shouted, 'Eureka!'
when I found the building permit."</TE>
<TE>   And the owners? "They decided they would sell," Gregory said,
cashing in on the added value of their suddenly historic Paul
Williams home.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Young Hollywood abounds in the Sunset Strip area where this house is
located. Leonardo DiCaprio lives down the street in one direction;
Tobey Maguire lives nearby in the other. The neighborhood has been
described as "the quintessential, high-end Sunset Strip celebrity
row."</LD>
<LD>   About this house: The owners, who are developers, rebuilt this
1956 house during the past two years with quiet in mind. They wanted
to evoke the atmosphere of Bali outdoors combined with a Zen
simplicity inside.</LD>
<LD>   The pool area is completely sheltered but retains mountain views.
The landscaping is lush and tropical.</LD>
<TE>   The developers didn't add square footage to the house, but largely
rebuilt it from the ground up. The house had been purchased from
producer Stacey Sher, Danny DeVito's partner at Jersey Films.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $3,799,000</TE>
<TE>   Size: Four bedrooms and six bathrooms in about 4,300 square feet</TE>
<TE>   Features: Besides the pool and gardens, there are several outdoor
fireplaces and fountains. The main house has a master suite and two
guest suites. There is also a separate guest house/studio.</TE>
<TE>   Where: Hollywood Hills in the Sunset Strip area</TE>

<LD>Renee Zellweger, who stars as the singing and dancing Roxie Hart in
the upcoming film version of the Broadway musical "Chicago," has
purchased a Bel-Air home for about $6.8 million.</LD>
<LD>   Zellweger, who was nominated for a best actress Oscar this year
for her role in "Bridget Jones's Diary" (2001), has been living in a
smaller Hollywood Hills home. She had bought that home two years ago
for about $1.8 million.</LD>
<LD>   The Bel-Air home has seven bedrooms, including a master suite with
an office and a workout room, and eight bathrooms in about 6,400
square feet.</LD>
<TE>   Designed by the late Southern California architect Paul Williams,
the traditional-style gated home that was recently updated was built
in the '30s. The home has a kitchen/family room, library, guest
house, maid's quarters, pool house, pool, loggia and gardens.</TE>
<TE>   The house, which sits on two-thirds of an acre, had been on and
off the market since March 2001 when it was originally listed at $8.9
million.</TE>
<TE>   Zellweger, 33, starred opposite Tom Cruise in the romantic comedy
"Jerry Maguire" (1996) and co-starred with Jim Carrey in "Me, Myself
and Irene" (2000).</TE>
<TE>   She co-stars with Ewan McGregor in the movie "Down With Love,"
which is scheduled to end shooting this week and be released next
year. The musical movie "Chicago" is due out Dec. 25.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Simon Cowell, a British record producer and one of three talent
judges on the Fox-TV show "American Idol: The Search for a
Superstar," has rented a Westside home for about $25,000 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Cowell reportedly rented the home for what has been described as
"the duration" of "American Idol." The gated house has five bedrooms
and seven bathrooms in about 7,500 square feet. The contemporary
villa, built in 1991, also has guest quarters, an office, pool and
waterfall.</TE>
<TE>   Cowell's primary residence is a four-bedroom home in London.</TE>
<TE>   "American Idol" is the American version of the British unscripted
series "Pop Idol," on which Cowell, 42, also was a judge. The other
judges on "American Idol" are singer-dancer Paula Abdul and record
executive Randy Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   The show's winner, selected from thousands of amateur singers,
will receive a recording contract with 19 Records, a Bertelsmann
Music Group label owned by Cowell and Simon Fuller, the show's
executive producer and former manager of the Spice Girls. Cowell also
will become manager of the winning act.</TE>
<TE>   David Kramer of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills North, represented
Cowell in renting the house. Jeff Hyland of Hilton &amp; Hyland, Beverly
Hills, had the listing, sources said.</TE>

<TE>   Pickfair Lodge--a home built for silent-screen matinee idol and
bandleader Buddy Rogers after his longtime wife, actress Mary
Pickford, died in 1979--has been listed at just under $4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Pickfair Lodge was built in 1980 on nearly an acre of land at
Pickfair, the Beverly Hills estate created in the '30s for Pickford
and her then-husband, actor Douglas Fairbanks. Pickford subdivided
the property over the years, reducing the size from 15 acres to 3.1
acres by the time the estate was sold in a 1980 probate hearing to
L.A. Laker owner Jerry Buss. Buss later sold Pickfair to businessman
Meshulam Riklis and his then-wife, actress Pia Zadora.</TE>
<TE>   The Pickfair estate, itself originally a hunting lodge, was turned
into a home for Pickford and Fairbanks in 1932 by architect Wallace
Neff. The couple divorced in 1936 and a year later, Pickford, dubbed
"America's Sweetheart," married Rogers, co-star of "Wings" (1927),
the first movie to win an Academy Award for best picture.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers and Pickford continued to live at Pickfair for more than 40
years. She agreed that the mansion could be sold upon her death and
encouraged Rogers to build a smaller house resembling Pickfair for
himself on part of the property, which he did in building Pickfair
Lodge.</TE>
<TE>   After Pickford died, Rogers married Palm Springs real estate agent
Beverly Ricono in 1981. The two split their time between Pickfair
Lodge and their desert home in Rancho Mirage. Rogers died in 1999 at
age 94.</TE>
<TE>   His widow is selling Pickfair Lodge, which has five bedrooms and
7.5 bathrooms in 7,000 square feet. The house also has high ceilings,
an Oriental-style room and a western bar. A large balcony overlooks
the grounds, which has a pool and a paddle tennis court.</TE>
<TE>   Nandu Hinds of Prudential California Realty in Beverly Hills, has
the listing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jim McDonnell, drummer "Slim Jim Phantom" with the former
rockabilly band the Stray Cats, has put the Sunset Strip-area condo
he has called home for a decade on the market at $509,000.</TE>
<TE>   McDonnell, 41, also owns the Cat Club next to the Whisky on Sunset
Strip. He says he needs a larger place to live because he is getting
married. His divorce from actress Britt Ekland, 59, was finalized in
spring though the couple have been apart for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   The condo, which has two bedrooms and two bathrooms in 1,400
square feet, also has hardwood floors, crown moldings, 11-foot
ceilings, a fireplace and courtyard views. It is in an eight-unit,
French-style complex built in 1938.</TE>
<TE>   The condo complex has housed many celebrities over the years.
McDonnell's unit was formerly owned by Gene Simmons of the rock band
KISS and his wife, actress Shannon Tweed.</TE>
<TE>   Actress Joan Crawford also lived in the unit at one time,
McDonnell said.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Ehrlich of Westside Estate Agency, Beverly Hills, has the
listing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   G. Dennis Lortz, producer of the TV series "Ripley's Believe It or
Not," has become a first-time home buyer with the purchase of a
two-bedroom, Country English-style home in West Hollywood for
$525,000.</TE>
<TE>   The single-story home also has two bathrooms, a fireplace,
hardwood floors, a breakfast bar and an intercom system.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Wenig of Gold Star Realty, Encino, represented Lortz in
buying.</TE>

<HD>Vacationing Owners Should Have Designated a Contact</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding: "Vacationing Owners Lose Their Condo" by Stephen Glassman
and Donie Vanitzian (Common Interest Living, June 23): When first
reading this, I was appalled at the actions of the association.
However, on the second read-through, a few questions came to mind.</LD>
<LD>   Obviously, these are responsible, fairly affluent owners (bought
condominium in full, paid major upgrades, decided to take a two-year
sailing trip, paying all dues, utilities, taxes, etc., in advance).
They made a point of questioning the board about any possible future
special assessments (i.e., garage doors and monthly increases) and
let the board know about their travel dates.</LD>
<LD>   When the owners returned after two years, of course they were
stunned to find that their unit had been sold after lien/foreclosure
for nonpayment of "contrived" violations and a garage door
assessment. And what a cruel blow that their personal belongings were
sold at a "garage sale."</LD>
<TE>   But I don't understand why such responsible people felt secure
leaving their home for two years without assigning a contact person
for emergencies. Anything can happen in a month, let alone two years.
What about roof leaks, gas or water breaks?</TE>
<TE>   The board should have been given a qualified contact person, maybe
even with power of attorney, for any such communication.</TE>
<TE>   I appreciated the suggestions about "actual notice" being required
on such a critical issue, and getting two or even three legal
opinions.</TE>

<HD>Don't Make a Move Without Research</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I recently purchased a new home and now face the daunting
task of moving. What's the best way to find a reliable moving company
at a fair price?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Since the moving industry was deregulated in 1995, many
companies have cropped up, promising the best rates. But the lowest
bid--particularly from those who advertise exclusively on the
Internet--isn't always the best, according to the American Moving and
Storage Assn., an industry trade group based in Alexandria, Va.</LD>
<LD>   "If you get some estimates, and one guy is half of everyone else,
that's a warning sign right there," spokesman David Sparkman said.
"The consumer thinks, 'I found the best deal,' but then they get to
the destination and are told it actually costs more."</LD>
<TE>   He suggests consumers first work from a list of reputable
companies to obtain price estimates. The trade group's Web site at
www.moving.org lists certified companies that agree to an arbitration
process in case of disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Referrals from friends and relatives are always helpful, while the
Better Business Bureau can report whether complaints have been filed
against the companies you are considering.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers should then gather written estimates from at least three
moving companies. Binding estimates are preferred because they lock
the company into a fixed price, even though they may run slightly
higher than nonbinding ones.</TE>
<TE>   Moving companies charge rates based on distance and weight, often
with additional charges for packing materials, driving in the city,
stairs or extra steps from the front door and the truck. That's why
estimates given solely over the phone or Internet are suspect,
Sparkman said. "No professional would ever give you an estimate over
the phone," he said. "They have to come into your home and see what's
there."</TE>
<TE>   Many people prefer to have their possessions packed by movers,
which may make a move more expensive. To save money, consumers should
consider packing items such as books and clothing themselves, because
boxes and tape tend to be charged at a markup over retail prices.
More fragile items, however, are best left to movers because
insurance doesn't always cover self-packed items.</TE>
<TE>   Also consider taking out additional insurance because many
consumer complaints about movers focus on damaged goods, according to
Consumer Reports.</TE>
<TE>   The standard coverage, which comes at no cost, is 60 cents per
pound per item. That means if a 10-pound crystal bowl costing $500 is
shattered, a consumer would only get $6. Homeowners insurance also
might provide some coverage, while movers offer supplemental coverage
at extra cost.</TE>
<TE>   When receiving estimates, ask the company to include the cost of
an inventory or a list of your goods with notes about any damage
before and after the move. Upon delivery, don't sign the inventory
until you have inspected your furniture and the exterior of the
cartons for damage.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, moving experts advise flexibility. Consumers can likely
get discounts and better service by avoiding the peak moving times of
May to September, or by waiting to move in the middle of the month
rather than the beginning or end.</TE>
<TE>   Other information about moving can be found at the American Moving
and Storage Assn.'s Web site, as well as www.moving.com  and
www.getamover.com.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>* Stack cartons in the truck by weight, from heaviest to lightest,
floor to ceiling.</LD>
<LD>   * Keep refrigerators, freezers, dishwashers and other major
appliances upright to avoid damage.</LD>
<LD>   * Place extra-long items such as mattresses, box springs, sofas
and large mirrors along the walls of the truck. Use mattress bags
sold at most truck rental locations to help prevent soiling.</LD>
<TE>   * Roll up and tie rugs and carpets. Disassemble bed frames and tie
the rails and crosspieces together with rope or tape. Load these
items lengthwise on the floor in the center of the truck.</TE>
<TE>   * Using wardrobe cartons, clothing can be packed on hangers. This
also cuts down on packing and unpacking time, and helps to avoid
wrinkling during transport.</TE>
<TE>   * Always bend your knees and lift with your legs, never with your
back. Get help moving large or heavy items. Use hand trucks with
load-locking straps; both are available at most rental facilities.</TE>
<TE>   * Place the heaviest items, such as major appliances and
furniture, on the truck first. Use rope or cord to secure doors on
appliances and dressers. Protect these items with blanket-style
furniture pads available with most rental trucks. Place cartons
around and on top of the heavy items.</TE>

<LD>You're getting ready to paint your house and you aren't certain what
type of paint to buy. If the old paint is latex, another coat of the
same is in order. If the old paint is oil base, however, an oil
primer is an absolute necessity, followed by a finish coat in oil or
latex.</LD>
<LD>   The important question is which type of paint currently covers
your home. Here's an easy way to find out.</LD>
<LD>   First, scrub a small sample area with a strong solution of common
household detergent.</LD>
<TE>   Rinse the area with plenty of fresh water and then towel-dry it.</TE>
<TE>   Then rub a cotton ball soaked in alcohol over the cleaned area. If
the paint comes off, it's latex, and if it doesn't, it's oil base.</TE>

<DH>IN SEARCH OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, By Tim Severin, Basic Books,
$25 SELKIRK'S ISLAND: The True and Strange Adventures of the Real
Robinson Crusoe, By Diana Souhami, Harcourt Trade Publishers, $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A common idea lies behind the ritziest Hawaiian coastal resort, the
most marginal Mexican beach shack, the script for "Cast Away" and the
last island "Survivor" episode: What if this beach were mine alone?</LD>
<LD>   The name we usually attach to that daydream is Robinson Crusoe,
hero of the 18th century story by Daniel Defoe that some people
consider the first English novel. But most historians agree that the
true and harrowing story behind that novel is the travail of one
Alexander Selkirk, a Scottish seaman cast ashore on an island off the
coast of Valparaiso, Chile, between 1704 and 1709. Defoe, already a
vastly prolific English journalist and author, tore Selkirk's story
from the headlines, merged it with other seafarers' castaway tales,
moved the island to tropical latitudes and concocted a moralistic and
vastly popular tale about ingenuity and the pleasures of the simple
life.</LD>
<LD>   Now come two authors looking to give us the grittier true story,
and in both versions it stinks of goat pelts (which Selkirk wore) and
often involves human beings behaving badly. Both books paint
Selkirk's island (current population: about 500) as a place for
subsistence, not seaside idylls.</LD>
<TE>   Drawing on old legal records and journals kept by sailors and
other contemporaries, the authors agree on much: Unlike Defoe's
Crusoe, who landed on his island because of a shipwreck and spent 28
years there, Selkirk was left behind, about 400 miles off Chile's
coast, after butting heads with a commanding officer on a faltering
mission of piracy. Selkirk's tenure alone lasted four years and four
months, after which he was rescued and his career as a seaman
resumed. Selkirk died in his 40s, leaving a widow in Scotland and
another in England. For years they fought over the inheritance.</TE>
<TE>   But beyond the skeleton of the story, the differences multiply
between Diana Souhami's slender, pungent book and Tim Severin's more
rambling, first-person literary detective account.</TE>
<TE>   I like Souhami's better: Resolutely narrow of focus, it implies
much by saying little. She clearly admires the island and writes with
authority about its plants, animals and seasons. (Part of the Juan
Fernandez archipelago, the isle's Spanish name was changed to
Robinson Crusoe Island in 1966 by the Chilean government.) She
sometimes seems eager to draw broad conclusions from scant data but
gets your attention when she makes the circumstantial case that
Selkirk not only ate goat meat and wore goat pelts but used the
animals for sexual release.</TE>
<TE>   Severin, author of more than a dozen previous books tracing
historical or fictional routes of such travelers as Ulysses, Sinbad
and Marco Polo, sees Selkirk's as just one of several true castaway
tales that fed Defoe's imagination, and his narrative turns to the
likely model for Man Friday, a Miskito Indian known as Will (who
spent three years alone on Selkirk's island in the early 1680s, 20
years before the Scotsman), and later to another likely model for
Crusoe, Henry Pitman, whose marooning took place on Salt Tortuga
Island in the Caribbean and was described in an English book
predating Defoe's.</TE>
<TE>   This gives Severin a chance to become a character in his own book,
as we follow him to Miskito territory in Nicaragua, Honduras, Panama
and several Caribbean islands, and to argue intriguingly against
conventional wisdom.</TE>

<TE>   THOMAS JEFFERSON'S MONTICELLO, Preface by Wendell Garrett, essays
by Lucia Stanton, William L. Beiswanger, Susan R. Stein and Peter
Hatch, Thomas Jefferson Foundation, $45</TE>
<TE>   This is a rare coffee-table book, not only handsome but full of
worthwhile text and insights into the life and thinking of Jefferson
as president, architect and Renaissance man. Along with excellent
photographs of Monticello's interiors and gardens, the book explains
the contemporaneous influences that shaped Jefferson's design and use
of the house. It also faces head-on the uncomfortable facts about
Jefferson as slave master.</TE>

<TE>   Keep an eye out for the blue-hued covers of the Moon Metro
guidebooks, a new series that is map-based, stylish and minimalist.
Moon Handbooks are known for cannily combining logistical information
with cultural background of a country or state. This urban
variation--the first cities covered are San Francisco, New York,
Paris and Washington, D.C. --is all about location, selectivity and
service information. For instance, among the scores of hotels in San
Francisco, the Moon editors include 43, mostly disdaining the chains.</TE>
<TE>   Each about 100 pages, they're built around fold-out neighborhood
maps and designed to slip into a pocket. They require some thumbing
through to connect addresses with information: For the full scoop on
La Chope restaurant on the Left Bank in Paris, for instance, you need
to dash between page 37 (where the address and phone are listed) and
Map 1 (which shows the neighborhood), with a stop at the front of the
book to remind yourself that the $ designation means entrees under
$10. On the whole, however, they're handsome and sensible books.</TE>

<LD>Thanks to the slump that usually affects our tropical neighbors
(Mexico, the Caribbean and Central America) in September and October,
tour operators and all-inclusive resort hotels will again offer a
large array of cheap seven-night vacations in sunny, exotic
locations.</LD>
<LD>   * Costa Rica: If you book from a company called Your Travel
Service, (888) 877-9131, www.yourtravelservice.com, you'll spend
seven nights in a country more and more Americans are visiting.
You'll start with five nights (including all meals and drinks) at the
well-located five-story Best Western Jaco Beach Resort, near Manuel
Antonio National Park. Your stay there will be preceded and followed
by one night in the capital, San Jose, at the Best Western Irazu
Hotel and Casino (10 minutes from town, with breakfast only).</LD>
<LD>   This combination of stays, which includes transportation between
the two cities, is ideal for people who want to obtain a broader
picture of life in Central America than the view from a beach chair.
Including midweek flights, from Sept. 1 through October, this package
costs $890 from Los Angeles; single supplement is $450.</LD>
<TE>   For eight days of loafing amid the greenery of the Allegro
Papagayo, stacked above Manzanillo Beach on the Pacific coast of
Costa Rica, you can use Capricorn Leisure, (800) 426-6544,
www.capricorn.net. From September through October it will take you
there from California for $933 per person, double occupancy. Singles
pay about $380 more, and everyone gets the usual inclusions:
round-trip air fare, a room for a week, three meals daily, drinks,
sports and entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   * Dominican Republic: Seven-night air-and-land packages to the
Amhsa Estrella del Mar in Cabarete, Dominican Republic, include
meals, drinks, hotel taxes, tips and lodging.</TE>
<TE>   Nonmotorized water sports are included, so you can try your hand
at windsurfing; Cabarete is considered one of the world's best
beaches for the sport.</TE>
<TE>   The 164-room resort is about 2- years old and has
air-conditioning, cable TV, phones and balconies. Based on midweek
round-trip air fare September through October, the price is $1,194
from Los Angeles, per person, double occupancy. Call TourScan at

<DH>Canada: Enjoying a barren kind of beauty on a driving trip

<AU>CARL DUNCAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DAWSON, Canada</DL>
<LD>Anne Saunders has lived here for 15 years. She likes the town, but
that's not what keeps her tethered.</LD>
<LD>   "Much as I love Dawson," she said, "the Dempster is why I live
here."</LD>
<LD>   Reaching north for 457 miles, the Dempster Highway runs from
Dawson in the Yukon to Inuvik in the Northwest Territories, two
degrees north of the Arctic Circle. Sitting atop the permafrost and
weathering temperatures that can vary as much as 142 degrees, the
Dempster is entirely gravel, 20 feet thick in places.</LD>
<TE>   Mile Post 0 of the Dempster stands just outside this colorful
turn-of-the-century Gold Rush town in the middle of the Yukon.
Century-old wood buildings here sit askew, and miners still pawn
their pokes of dust at the General Store on Front Street for a
season's worth of grub.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer Dawson welcomes thousands of visitors who come here
to stroll, shop for antiques, explore historic mines and old log
cabins, and catch the Gaslight Follies at the Palace Grand Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   The Dempster, by contrast, is legendary for the isolated landscape
it traverses and the flora and fauna it showcases along the way.
Saunders, whose hobby is photographing wildflowers, drove the
Dempster 25 times last summer, she told me.</TE>
<TE>   For most of its length, the land the Dempster crosses bears no
sign of human passage or presence: no side roads, no houses, no
telephone or power poles, no scars upon the land. There is but a
single hotel/service station complex midway. On the road, travelers
routinely spot grizzlies, black bears, moose, caribou, Dall sheep and
many species of birds.</TE>
<TE>   Having heard glowing accounts of Dawson and the Dempster, I
decided to see for myself and timed my drive to be in Inuvik on the
summer solstice, the first day of summer when the sun won't set again
for nearly two months.</TE>
<TE>   I flew to Whitehorse, the Yukon's capital, and rented an SUV at
the airport, then headed north for 330 miles on the quiet Klondike
Highway to Dawson. As I drove, the trees got smaller, and the sky got
bigger. By the time I reached Dawson, I was beginning to understand
why it's said that the Yukon is the place Alaskans go to get away
from it all. The entire territory--at 205,345 square miles, about the
size of California and Tennessee combined--has just 31,000 people,
and I had left 23,000 of those behind in Whitehorse.</TE>
<TE>   Dawson, with 1,800 people, is the Yukon's second-largest community
and sits at the juncture of the Klondike and Yukon rivers. In August
1896, Skookum Jim and some mining buddies found gold just outside
Dawson at Bonanza Creek, kicking off the Klondike Stampede. Dawson
shot up overnight, adding boardwalks, barrooms, bordellos and
boardinghouses. It's a fun town to visit, and like many Dempster
drivers, I tarried for a couple of days before setting out and felt
transported to another era.</TE>
<TE>   And then it was time to go.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Dempster, the only way into Canada's Western Arctic was
by bush plane or dog sled. The Dempster Highway project was begun in
1958, following a route laid out by native trapper Joe Henry, who
lived in Dawson. In 1964 the entirely gravel highway (asphalt cannot
be used because of the shifting permafrost) had reached only to the
120-mile mark at Chapman Lake. It wasn't until 1979 that the Dempster
was officially completed all the way to Inuvik.</TE>
<TE>   It was 80 degrees at the service station in Dawson when I topped
the tank. The next gas station was not for about 250 miles. Soon
after I entered the Dempster the scenery changed dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   Rounded hills turned into jagged peaks with snow highlighting the
crannies. The landscape was carpeted with dwarf birch, stunted spruce
and Arctic willows that in southern climes would be thick forest.</TE>
<TE>   Although only about 60 miles from Dawson, I stopped the first
night at the Tombstone Park Campground alongside the North Fork of
the Yukon. The Tombstone region has the most easily accessible hiking
of any place along the Dempster. The park warden here in the summer
leads evening interpretive hikes into the surrounding hills.</TE>
<TE>   I joined half a dozen fellow campers on a scenic traipse over
springy moss and crispy lichens. The view was spectacular, and the
air deliciously fresh.</TE>
<TE>   Back at camp, I sat near the tent by the river reading a book of
poetry by Robert Service. The so-called "Canadian Kipling" lived in
the Yukon for eight years and wrote his most famous works in a little
log cabin in Dawson. Though I read well into the night, there was no
need for a flashlight. At midnight, the sky was blue, and white
clouds cast shadows.</TE>
<TE>   Weather can change rapidly here. By 6 a.m., rain clouds had blown
in, and by midmorning it was chilly and much darker than the previous
night's "dusk." At Mile 64, just beyond the aptly named Two Moose
Lake, I saw my first Alaska Yukon (or Tundra) moose, the largest in
North America. The big bull, about 7 feet at the shoulder, was
standing in the middle of the road. I never realized how big they
really are. As I fumbled for my camera, he loped out of sight.</TE>
<TE>   The Dempster weaves in and out of the tree line, and the tundra
begins where the trees end. "Have you walked on the tundra?" reads an
interpretive placard on the roadside. "Try it. It's not as easy at
looks!" I stopped near one of a thousand nameless thaw lakes and got
out.</TE>
<TE>   Walking on the spongy sedges, mosses and lichens of the tundra was
slow but not difficult. Where the tundra turned into muskeg, however,
as it did along the shoreline and in the low-lying areas, difficult
became impossible. Each footstep sank deep into the boggy vegetation,
and cold water seeped over the tops of my hiking boots and soaked my
socks. I understood then why people here wait for freeze-up before
trying any cross-country travel.</TE>
<TE>   As I slogged through the muskeg, the Arctic terns attacked. They
divebombed me, zooming down with their feet outstretched and
squawking fiercely. The Dempster is a birder's paradise, and I had
blundered onto a nesting ground. These guys have a long annual
migration--24,000 miles from here in the Arctic down to the Antarctic
and back again.</TE>
<TE>   The temperature continued to drop rapidly, and by the time I
reached Eagle Plains Hotel at Mile 229, just 22 miles south of the
Arctic Circle, snow was blowing across the road. The pass ahead had
been closed, and a gate with red flashing lights blocked the roadway.
No one would be driving any farther today.</TE>
<TE>   Rooms at the hotel, the only one along the entire Dempster, were
snug and warm if nondescript. The constant sunshine soon melted the
freak late snow, and by noon the next day, the roadway had already
dried.</TE>
<TE>   The Dempster crosses the Arctic Circle at a scenic overlook amid
the Richardson Mountains (Mile 252). An interpretive display there
claims that the Arctic gets as much solar energy in one 24-hour
period in the summer as the equator gets in a similar period. No
wonder summer growth is so rapid.</TE>
<TE>   Blue lupines, fireweed, foxtails, wild roses and even sunflowers
colored the roadside.</TE>
<TE>   About 60 miles after crossing the circle, the Dempster leaves the
Yukon and enters the Northwest Territories. On the NWT side are two
river crossings, at the Peel and the Mackenzie. Both have free
ferries. I slipped onto both behind only two other vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Inuvik is less than two hours' drive beyond the Mackenzie ferry. A
no-nonsense far-north working town, Inuvik is the life support for
the entire Western Arctic with airport, banks, hotels, mechanics and
more. I checked into a small cabin at the Arctic Chalet, chowed down
on a flavorful but coarse-textured musk ox burger at To Go's for
lunch and visited the new community greenhouse, curious to see an
Arctic garden.</TE>
<TE>   No one was there when I arrived, but soon Anne Dahlseide, one of
the gardeners, dropped by and showed me around. There were 70
thriving raised beds (everything is raised here--above the
permafrost) each lovingly tended by a different gardener. "It's only
our third year, and already we have a waiting list of 37," she said.
"We're still experimenting. We really don't know what seeds will grow
up here, but we do grow good zucchinis."</TE>
<TE>   From late fall to late spring, the frozen Mackenzie River becomes
an ice road that continues the Dempster route on to Tuktoyuktuk on
the Arctic shore, about 80 miles north of Inuvik. In summer, however,
you must fly to Tuk. Cultural excursions are offered by an Inuvik
tour company that include the round-trip flight. They fill rapidly
because many people who drive the Dempster want to go all the way and
see the Arctic Ocean. I booked a full day cultural tour that included
a traditional meal in a resident's house.</TE>
<TE>   The plane departed at 9:30 a.m. for the scenic 40-minute flight
along the edge of the immense Mackenzie River Delta. We soon left
behind the last traces of the boreal forest. In its place spread blue
lakes with patches of bright white ice and green-brown tundra
puckered like alligator skin. Ninety percent of Tuk's population of
about 1,000 is Inuvialuit (meaning "original people") of the Western
Arctic, formerly known to outsiders as Eskimos.</TE>
<TE>   After a tour of the town and the beach, where all but one of the
tourists bowed to tradition and dipped their feet in the Arctic Ocean
(I don't like cold water), we went to the home of James and Maureen
Pokiak. Like most Inuvialuits in Tuk, they hunt, trap, fish and whale
for their yearly food supply.</TE>
<TE>   Maureen laid out a traditional Inuvialuit lunch: caribou soup,
bannock, dry fish, smoked beluga whale meat, whale oil and boiled
maktaaq, or muktuk, the narrow layer of blubber between the whale
skin and the fat. "I boil it about an hour in the smokehouse," she
said. It tastes something like tofu boiled in rank fish sauce with a
touch of bacon drippings.</TE>
<TE>   To the Inuvialuits, muktuk (boiled or raw) is the most coveted of
all delicacies. Many dip it in whale oil, which is used here much
like some people use butter or mayonnaise. A small tub of
strong-smelling whale oil sat in the middle of the table.</TE>
<TE>   Although whalers used it for lantern oil, they never ate it, and
they often suffered from scurvy, a nutritional disease caused by lack
of vitamin C.</TE>
<TE>   The Inuvialuits knew nothing about the disease, even though their
diet was almost completely without vitamin-rich vegetables. Whale oil
is a good source of vitamin C.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Inuvik, the Mackenzie Delta Drum Dancers put on a great
show with traditional Inuvialuit dances and music at Jim Koe Park.
This dance was a celebration of the summer solstice (although dances
go on all summer). Today was officially summer, and the sun wouldn't
set again in this part of the Arctic for 59 days.</TE>
<TE>   At 1 a.m. I woke with sunlight streaming in my eyes. I looked out
and saw the full moon beckoning in the south. It was too much.</TE>
<TE>   When would I get another chance to drive across the tundra under
the midnight sun?</TE>
<TE>   I grabbed my gear, slipped on a pair of sunglasses, and headed
south for Dawson.</TE>

<HD>New Hotels in Italy, California Target the Luxury Traveler</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two intimate Italian villas, one in Venice, Italy, and one thousands
of miles away in (surprise) Paso Robles, Calif., have opened with the
same goal: to attract the luxury traveler.</LD>
<LD>   In Venice, the 14-room Palazzo Sant' Angelo Sul Canal Grande is
one of the city's few hotels with its main entrance on the Grand
Canal and a private boat dock for guests. Built as a three-story,
private palazzo in the 1940s, it was converted into a hotel by
Italy's Sina Hotels company, a spokeswoman said.</LD>
<LD>   Rooms, decorated in 18th century style with red and gold silk wall
coverings, have modern technology: dataports, fax machines and
satellite TV. Marble bathrooms include spa tubs.</LD>
<TE>   The hotel is at San Marco 3488-3489. Room rates begin at about
$210 (or $180 if booked on the Internet). (800) 448-8355,
www.palazzosantangelo.com.</TE>
<TE>   In Paso Robles, the eight-room Villa Toscana, which owners say is
modeled after an Italian estate, opened this weekend at Martin &amp;
Weyrich Winery Estate Vineyards. Rooms include spa tubs, sitting
rooms and balconies with views of the vineyards and countryside, plus
beds outfitted with 700-thread count Italian linens. The largest is
3,500 square feet, with two bedrooms.</TE>
<TE>   As one would expect in wine country, food is a major focus. There
is a private restaurant on site, exclusive to guests. Room rates,
from $320 to $1,600, include full breakfast, afternoon wine and hors
d'oeuvres and a bottle of wine upon arrival. (805) 238-5600,

<HD>Vegas Cab Riders Get the Runaround, Agency Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LAS VEGAS--Tourists taking taxis from the airport to Las Vegas hotels
are often driven on roundabout trips that inflate fares, according to
the Nevada Taxicab Authority.</LD>
<LD>   Months of undercover investigation found long hauling--the
practice of taking passengers on a longer and more costly route
without their permission--is rampant.</LD>
<LD>   "It permeates the industry," authority administrator John Plunkett
told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. "If we do 10 undercover rides,
there's a good chance between six and eight will be long hauls."</LD>
<TE>   The investigation, which led to about 200 citations, focused on
trips originating at McCarran International Airport. Long-hauling
cabdrivers most often take unsuspecting airport passengers south
through the airport connector tunnel to the beltway and then on to
Interstate 15 to reach the Strip. The most direct route to Strip
hotels is north on Swenson Street to Tropicana Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Some drivers defend the practice, saying their trips through the
tunnel save time. But Bill Shranko, director of operations at
Yellow-Checker-Star Cab, said company drivers who receive two
complaints or citations for long hauling are fired.</TE>

<HD>A Guide to Beach Closures Around the U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wondering whether it's safe to swim at the beach you plan to visit on
your next trip? Check the Internet before going.</LD>
<LD>   Two environmental groups this month began posting beach closures
around the U.S. on their Web sites, www.earth911.org and
www.oceana.org.</LD>
<LD>   The information is filed by the patchwork of county, municipal and
state departments that monitor beaches in various locales, said
Jackie Savitz, director of the pollution campaign for Oceana, a
year-old private, nonprofit group based in Washington, D.C., that
promotes ocean conservation. "The plan is ultimately to cover the
whole [U.S.] marine coast," she added.</LD>
<TE>   Several hundred beaches were included in the program as of last
week, said Alexia Emmermann, spokeswoman for Earth 911, a
Phoenix-based clearinghouse for environmental data. In California,
only beaches in San Diego and San Francisco counties were listed;
data from other counties is planned, organizers said.</TE>

<LD>The State Department has canceled its warning against travel to
India, which was issued June 26, saying border tensions between India
and Pakistan have subsided. It noted, however, that "the risk of
renewed increased tensions ... cannot be ruled out." The department
still warns against travel to Pakistan, especially in light of the
recent conviction of suspects in the kidnap-murder of American
reporter Daniel Pearl. It also lifted a warning on Madagascar that
was issued in April, noting the "improving security and logistical
situation."</LD>

parade of sails Aug. 8; an art and food fair; and music on five
stages. Most events are free, except for tours of the ships Aug. 9 to
11. Tour tickets are about $6.50 (plus taxes and service charges) in

<LD>The Silversea's Silver Cloud is structuring its itineraries next year
so guests can take an entire cruise--or only the segments that
interest them.</LD>
<LD>   The service begins with the Jan. 3 sailing from Fort Lauderdale,
Fla. For example, under the new program, called Personalized Voyages,
passengers can choose an entire nine-night trip to Colon, Panama, or
they may sign on for as few as five consecutive nights, embarking in
Key West, Fla.; Cozumel, Mexico; Belize; or Costa Rica.</LD>
<LD>   Passengers who take a partial cruise on the 286-passenger Silver
Cloud will pay a daily rate (determined by season and cabin class).
Prices for 2003 sailings range from $345 to $795 a day, per person,
double occupancy, with a minimum of five consecutive nights.
Passengers on the program will arrange their air transportation to
the embarkation point.</LD>

<DL>MARINA DEL REY</DL>
<LD>When I moved to L.A. from New York, living near a beach was a
profound novelty, and I used to spend my Sunday afternoons at
Temescal Canyon beach in a sand chair, reading. Twelve years later,
seven of them in Pasadena and Eagle Rock, my family of four makes it
to the beach twice a year, tops.</LD>
<LD>   Not that we don't try: I often look for deals in Santa Barbara (as
if!), San Diego or Santa Monica, but they can be hard to come by,
especially this time of year. Tipped off about summer promotions
offered by the Marriott chain, I found a hotel it identified as a
"resort" in Marina del Rey and booked it for the Fourth of July
holiday.</LD>
<LD>   The hotel, between fairly busy Washington Boulevard and Admiralty
Way, is across the street from Mothers Beach and row after row of
fancy boats, and a reasonable walk to the ocean. My husband, Sean,
and I didn't have extravagant plans: unlimited pool time, biking,
beaching--just being away.</LD>
<TE>   Standard rooms come with a king bed and a rollaway or with two
doubles. With Devin, 8, and Susannah, 5, we needed a second full bed
and, if possible, separate sleeping areas for kids and parents. I
asked the reservations clerk about possibly upgrading to a suite, and
she said she would make a notation on my reservation.</TE>
<TE>   Our trip date rolled around, and when we arrived at 4 p.m. for
check-in, no upgrade was available. But still swept up in the
excitement of a hotel stay near the beach, we headed to our room on
the ninth (top) floor. This began the weekend's running argument
between the kids: who got to push the elevator buttons.</TE>
<TE>   Though Sean and I were underwhelmed by the size and stuffy air of
Room 925, Susannah, for whom any night away from home is an event,
pronounced it "small but good." And the view north, encompassing the
coast, would be great for that night's fireworks. (Our rate, $129 per
night, was part of a "Come Out and Play" promotion that has since
ended, but other promotions--including weekend "leisure rates" and
specials for AAA members and American Express cardholders--were still
available as of the Travel section's press time Tuesday.)</TE>
<TE>   We went down to the pool and saw at once that the photo on the
hotel's Web site had been shot with a wide-angle lens. The pool is
barely 20 feet long, but it is comfortably heated, never gets deeper
than 5 feet (perfect for kids) and is in a lovely landscaped pocket
off the lobby. There's a spacious Jacuzzi and towel service as well.</TE>
<TE>   While Sean went for a run on the beach, I played "monkey in the
middle" with the kids. We were reminded how late afternoons near the
ocean can be chilly and after about an hour and a half started
thinking about dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Our plan for the weekend was to park the car once, walk everywhere
and perhaps in the process reaquaint our kids with a mode of
transportation they don't often experience. About a block and a half
from the hotel is Edie's, an independently owned '50s-style diner
recommended by Westside friends.</TE>
<TE>   The lovely waterside deck at Edie's was already crowded with
people in a good position to watch the fireworks. We were seated near
the deck door in a booth that brought to mind the old bench-style car
seats.</TE>
<TE>   It soon became apparent that Edie's had holiday staffing problems.
Half an hour after we had been seated, we still had no food, and the
family of five across the aisle hadn't been able to order. When our
food finally arrived, it was fine--an omelet, Reuben sandwich, burger
and chicken fingers--and our beleaguered waitress comped the kids'
ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the Marriott, the hotel's rooftop terrace was open for
watching the fireworks, and Sean and Devin headed up there. Susannah
and I turned out the lights in our room, opened the curtains over the
sliding-glass door and got a panoramic view of about four fireworks
displays from Venice on north, as well as some elaborate backyard
celebrations.</TE>
<TE>   Because our room was stuffy and my husband craves the smell of the
ocean, we left the sliding glass door cracked open to sleep. Big
mistake. Washington Boulevard was surprisingly busy on the Friday
after the holiday. A bus stop was within earshot, and we woke to the
sound of bus idling and accelerating at 6 a.m. The kids and I were
wide-awake, and after a fruitless try-to-go-back-to-sleep period, we
let Dad sleep and headed down to Stones, the hotel's restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   I was concerned that the white tablecloths and napkin-stuffed
water goblets spelled a fancy-schmancy breakfast, but the hostess
quickly brought out crayons and an activity sheet/menu for the kids.
They ordered pancakes, which were served with a Froot Loop garni. For
the rest of us, there were a variety of buffets--fruit and cereal,
one that was pastry-centric, and another of chafing dishes of eggs
and meats.</TE>
<TE>   Later the four of us set out on the short walk to the beach and
arrived just as Venice One-Stop was opening. We rented two
"tag-a-longs," tandem bikes in which the rear portion is child-sized.</TE>
<TE>   As we steered north, our skittish passengers quickly warmed to the
sensation of cruising the bike path under a crisp morning cloud
cover, and Sean and I rediscovered the fun of biking between the
ocean and the one-and-only Venice boardwalk. It had been a few years,
and we were pleased to find the pulsing street carnival scene there
unchanged. Our kids were more taken with the array of new playground
structures planted in the sand along the way, so on the way back we
stopped to sample them.</TE>
<TE>   It's not for the fainthearted, that bike path. Author Sara
Davidson wrote in the '70s, "There are too many people on wheels. The
skaters will fall, the bikers will crash, they will fly out of
control and there is nothing to hold onto." It's still true, and I
appreciated it in a different, more prosaic sense as a parent with a
small child perched on the back of my bicycle.</TE>
<TE>   We turned in our bikes and lounged on the beach, then headed back
toward the hotel along funky lower Washington, which has the feel of
an old beach town, though not without a few trendy spots. We stopped
for lunch at one of these, Mercede's Cuban Grille, and let's just say
they were a lot nicer about serving hot and tired kids than our two
deserved. Sean and I had delicious omelets, and the helpful waitress
suggested a half-order of the coconut-fried rice for my daughter. My
son had a thick, spicy pork sandwich. The food was terrific, our
seaters and servers kind and indulgent.</TE>
<TE>   Susannah and I took a siesta while the boys swam again, then we
all walked over to Mothers Beach, the quiet sand spit on the bay side
of the marina. With its alphabet-block lifeguard stand and plethora
of children, it's a cozy, quiet beach, popular with parents of
younger kids. When a teenager tried to take a boogie board into the
water, he was rebuked by a megaphoning lifeguard.</TE>
<TE>   Devin chose this moment to decide he didn't like the feel of sand
on his skin, but Susannah and I lingered in the golden late afternoon
sun, building an entire sand city and a retaining wall to guard
against the incoming tide.</TE>
<TE>   Our kids had seen the Marina del Rey outpost of the family burger
chain Islands as we drove in, and during our long wait at Edie's the
night before they had moaned that this would never have happened at
Islands. So that was our dinner destination, about two blocks away.
As we were seated, somewhere an infant shrieked, and we knew we were
home.</TE>
<TE>   After dinner we walked down to the pier at the foot of Washington,
watched the fishers and admired a rather show-offy pelican. There
were protests and foot-dragging from our kids and various sibling
squabbles, and at one point I longed to escape our weekend escape.
Sean took the high road; despite it all, he loved being back by the
ocean, and I grudgingly agreed.</TE>
<TE>   That night we cranked up the A/C, drew the drapes and slept much
better. The next morning, after another elevator-button altercation,
we left the hotel via the alley in the back and went around the
corner to Joni's Coffee Roaster ("Born to Be Wired") on Washington,
where we had fabulous coffee, cereal, granola and bagels.</TE>
<TE>   Susannah and I took another morning bike ride around the marina,
picking our favorite boat names while the men checked out of the
hotel. We had wanted to play tennis (which the Web site says is
"nearby"), but when we asked one of the young, attractive but
somewhat uninformed desk clerks, we learned the courts are at the
Ritz-Carlton down the road, available to Marriott guests for $25 an
hour.</TE>
<TE>   Our $129 room rate, as with most quoted lodging prices, was
somewhat deceptive: with taxes and $14-a-day parking, it was about
$160. Yes, we got away for less than $200 a night, got a whiff of the
ocean air, but with two kids in a standard hotel room, you don't
actually escape; you just move the chaos to a different venue, which,
depending on your point of view, may not be so bad.</TE>

<LD>Most weary travelers unlock the hotel door, drop their suitcases and
collapse. David Britton's entry style is a little different.</LD>
<LD>   He moves a hand over doorsills and the tops of mirrors. He runs a
thumbnail over the inside end of the tub, where soap residue tends to
collect. He looks everywhere--behind the shower curtain, on the
bedspreads--for stray hairs.</LD>
<LD>   And if you want to know whether the carpet's clean? "Wear white
socks and walk across it," says Britton, vice president of marketing
for Vagabond Franchise System Inc. in Los Angeles, which operates
Vagabond hotel properties.</LD>
<TE>   His checklist goes to the heart of an issue that should concern
travelers: How do you know if a hotel room has been cleaned
thoroughly? And what do you do if it isn't? How do you know which
dirt or other residue in a hotel room is hazardous to your health and
which is a cosmetic, albeit disgusting, one? Is the hotel pool a
risk? And should you take antibacterial sprays and soaps just in
case?</TE>
<TE>   Hotel rooms can be less than spotless and still not be hazardous
to your health, experts agree. But hotel rooms that would pass the
health department's guidelines can still be cosmetically
unacceptable, Britton says.</TE>
<TE>   "Every member of the traveling public applies a stiffer standard
to a hotel room than their own home," says Britton, a past president
of the California Hotel &amp; Lodging Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Stray hair, for instance, generally elicits disgust, but probably
"you're not going to catch anything from a stray hair," says Dr.
Aaron Glatt, a fellow of the Infectious Disease Society of America
and chief of infectious diseases at the St. Vincent Catholic Medical
Centers of New York. "Theoretically a stray hair could have nits
[from head lice]," he says, but it's not likely.</TE>
<TE>   Cold viruses can live hours or even longer, Glatt says, although
how long varies. If a departing guest with a cold sneezed on the door
handle and it wasn't thoroughly cleaned, in theory an arriving guest
could touch the door handle, touch his face or nose and catch the
cold, he says. But Glatt says that some things left in a hotel room
should give you pause and trigger a request for a new room--or a move
to another hotel. Those include a blood-stained bandage or towel and
used condoms or syringes.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond those red-flag items, "things can look clean and not be
clean," says Dr. John M. Leedom, professor of medicine and chief of
the division of infectious diseases at the USC's Keck School of
Medicine. For instance, you can catch scabies, which causes intense
itching, from bedding or clothing as well as skin-to-skin contact
with an infected person.</TE>
<TE>   Guarding against scabies isn't always easy, as Dr. Brian Terry, a
Pasadena physician who often counsels travelers, can attest after
treating many patients with the condition. "You get it from people
and linens," he says. "Make sure your linens are clean as well as
your bed partners."</TE>
<TE>   It can be difficult for hotel guests to determine how sterile a
hot tub is. Leedom simply avoids them. But if you can't resist taking
the plunge, be aware that one risk is so-called hot tub folliculitis,
in which hair follicles become infected and inflamed as a result of
bacterial contamination of the water. Again, it's impossible to know
by looking whether the organisms are lurking.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel pool is generally not a major risk for health problems,
Glatt says, but it is not risk-free. One hazard is fecal
contamination. When this contamination occurs, it dramatically
reduces the ability of the chlorine to kill the parasite
Cryptosporidium, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. That parasite can cause diarrhea if swimmers ingest
contaminated water in swimming pools and water parks, the CDC says.
There's no foolproof way to avoid this, but Leedom suggests avoiding
pools where young children in diapers are wading.So should you arm
yourself with antibacterial products before leaving home?</TE>
<TE>   Glatt calls the antibacterial sprays and soaps "a waste of time
for non-hospital use." And Leedom says, "I don't think it's been
proven that these products are helpful to anyone but the people who
sell them."</TE>
<TE>   But Terry suggests that waterless hand cleaners, available over
the counter, can be helpful because they allow you to clean your
hands before meals if water isn't readily available, reduce germs and
possibly illness.</TE>
<TE>   All agree that the best defense is common sense.</TE>
<TE>   If you do find potential health hazards in a room that's clearly
substandard, you have a right to leave without paying, says Jim
Abrams, executive vice president of the California Hotel &amp; Lodging
Assn. "When you make a reservation it's a basic contract," he says.
If the room is substandard "the innkeeper has breached his contract."</TE>
<TE>   He suggests alerting the innkeeper that you are departing and not
paying, giving the reasons and requesting your credit card not be
charged. If the room is substandard and no other acceptable room is
available, there should be no repercussions, Abrams says.</TE>

<HD>Unique Hotels Give Guests a Place in History</HD>
<DH>Preservation group markets U.S. lodgings with character,
whether your taste is Art Deco or Victorian or older.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For many of us, hitting the road means traveling down memory lane,
visiting places significant in America's history. This summer, 48% of
U.S. adults said they expected to visit a historic site, 6% more than
last year, according to an annual survey by the Travel Industry Assn.
of America.</LD>
<LD>   Interest in historic and cultural trips has been increasing for
several years, the TIA found. One index of that interest is the
exponential growth in National Trust Historic Hotels of America, a
program of the private, nonprofit National Trust for Historic
Preservation that markets lodgings with a past.</LD>
<LD>   The hotel group, founded in 1989 with 32 members, grew to more
than 100 hotels in just four years. This spring it added 12 members,
the largest addition ever, boosting the total to 184 in 44 U.S.
states plus one in Canada.</LD>
<TE>   Members include such nationally known names as the Hotel del
Coronado in Coronado, the Waldorf-Astoria in New York and the
Williamsburg Inn in Williamsburg, Va., plus many that are obscure.
California, with 20, has the most, including two at Yosemite National
Park that were added in April.</TE>
<TE>   "We're on the receiving end of a trend," says Thierry Roch,
executive director of National Trust Historic Hotels. Travelers,
especially baby boomers, are looking for lodgings with "character and
personality," he says, often with links to personal and family
histories.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, in partnership with Traveling America, Historic
Hotels began offering "Driving Journeys" packages with themes such as
architecture, African American heritage and the founding fathers.
They combine stays at historic lodgings with admission to museums and
other attractions.</TE>
<TE>   Many are three or four days and cost less than $400 per person.
Others are longer. The "Blue Ridge Parkway From Top to Bottom" lasts
12 days, includes six hotels and is "priced upon request," the
group's Web site says. From 60 itineraries, the "Driving Journeys"
list has grown to about 400 in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   To belong to the National Trust Historic Hotels of America,
lodgings must meet several criteria, Roch says: They must be
full-service, with food and beverages; be at least 50 years old; be
listed on the National Register of Historic Places, be eligible to be
on that register or have received a local accolade for historic
preservation; and "faithfully maintain their architectural integrity,
both inside and out."</TE>
<TE>   A major qualification: Each hotel must pay annual dues of $30 per
room, with a $3,990 minimum and $8,990 maximum. New members generally
pay an initiation fee of $5,000. Thus, not every historic hotel
belongs to the group. The hotels that do belong represent an
astonishing range, from small, independent inns to big chain resorts,
with nightly room rates from $59 (Inn at Newport Beach in Newport,
R.I.) to $15,000 (for a suite at the Plaza in New York).</TE>
<TE>   Although many member hotels earn high ratings from organizations
such as AAA, membership is no assurance of quality. Historic Hotels
of America, based in Washington, D.C., with seven employees and an
annual $1.2-million budget, doesn't conduct regular inspections, Roch
says. Only one hotel has been ejected because of guest complaints
during his three years on the job, although "there are several we're
taking a close look at now," he said. Roch declined to identify the
hotels.</TE>
<TE>   To reserve at a member hotel, call (800) 678-8946 or visit
www.historichotels.org. A part of the room cost booked through the
group goes to the National Trust. Hotels are listed on the Web site
and in a directory that can be ordered for $3.50 (check or money
order) from National Trust Historic Hotels of America, P.O. Box 320,
Washington, DC 20055-0320.</TE>

<LD>I loved "Finding Swiss Bliss in Zermatt" (July 21). Two years ago my
two sons, ages 41 and 40, took a bicycle trip to Switzerland. One of
the highlights was the ride to Zermatt from Lauterbrunnen.</LD>
<LD>   I had been to Zermatt twice and remembered, as you stated, that
there was no car traffic from Tasch to Zermatt. But there were vans,
taxis and all manner of supply trucks up and down that narrow last
stretch. It was really dangerous, but we were thrilled to have ridden
the distance.</LD>
<LD>   At the end of three days we were ready to get back on the saddles
for the downhill ride.</LD>

<LD>Your article "In an Era of Turbulence, Airline Satisfaction Rising"
(Travel Insider, July 21) does not touch on all the reasons for the
discontent with airlines. If the CEOs or high-ranking airline
officials took a five-hour trip in coach class, they would understand
the root of the dissatisfaction.</LD>
<LD>   The aircraft is mostly coach, where the thundering herd sits
scrunched up, knees touching the seat in front, for hours on end.</LD>
<LD>   When I first started traveling by airline, the coach section was
not as cramped as it is now.</LD>

<LD>Regarding "Lakeside in the High Sierra" (July 7): I have been lucky
enough to call Huntington Lake my second home since I began
vacationing there as an infant. Thomas Curwen not only accurately
depicted this beautiful place, but he also captured its essence.</LD>
<LD>   Regarding Curwen's comment about children having a nostalgic
reverie in 30 years: I am only 20 and already I feel a certain
longing for the simple pleasures that characterized my childhood.</LD>

<TE>   I love Huntington Lake because I can still find solitude there,
unlike the lakes of the Eastern Sierras, which often are crowded.</TE>
<TE>   I've stayed at all the places mentioned in the article. I found
Cedar Crest to be the most family-friendly place to stay. It has
tetherball and horseshoe games for children.</TE>
<TE>   During the summer, rangers hold evening story hours there. On
weekends, Cedar Crest has a bonfire, and an old reel-to-reel movie is
shown on a screen outdoors while everyone munches on popcorn. What I
love about Cedar Crest is the special attention it gives their
visitors. Unexpected things happen when people travel with children,
and Cedar Crest is always willing to go the extra mile without being
asked.</TE>
<TE>   In my experience, Crestview works beautifully if you don't have
children because of its isolation. This is the place to stay if you
don't want crowds.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Lake Lodge is good because of its accessibility to the
restaurant and the bar.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Luggage That Fits Into the Post-Sept. 11 World" (Travel
Insider, June 16): It's time for luggage companies to smarten up.
They're missing a big money-maker: two compatible roll-aboards. One
you check in; the other would hold my medicine, books, newspapers and
other things I might need in case the checked luggage is lost.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes I carry two roll-aboard bags, but they are difficult to
maneuver together. Surely someone could design a pair that would fit
together.</LD>

<LD>ALONG THE RICHARDSON HIGHWAY, Alaska--At least a dozen people died in
the winter of 1913 along the old Valdez-Fairbanks Trail, lost in
churning blizzards as they struggled to find Yost's Roadhouse. The
two-story log lodge in the central Alaska Range was often so buried
in snow that only its stovepipe poked above the drifts. Yost's was
200 yards back from the trail, making it even harder to find in a
storm.</LD>
<LD>   The summer after that deadly season, a Lt. Dougherty of the U.S.
Army Signal Corps installed a wire fence across the winter trail to
steer blizzard-blind trekkers toward the front door, and a 150-pound
bell mounted near the roadhouse would clang whenever the wind blew.
Those innovations are said to have saved many lives.</LD>
<LD>   I had heard of these Alaskan roadhouses long before I arrived in
Fairbanks early last spring, but I had never seen one. Now bad
weather in the mountains gave me the opportunity. I was in this part
of Alaska to observe research at nearby Black Rapids Glacier for a
book I'm writing. But storms over the glacier had put me on hold for
a few days, so I was free to roam the 366-mile Richardson Highway to
reconnoiter some of Alaska's better-known roadhouses.</LD>
<TE>   At one time, the state had more than 3,000 of these inns, which
ranged from dugouts to tents to more elaborate log lodges. In the
days when Alaska's trails were negotiated only by dog sled, horse
sled or on foot, the roadhouses were a traveler's haven as well as a
peculiar social institution. Typically, a traveler got a hot meal for
$2; another $2 got him and his dog team a snug place to sleep.
Enterprising pioneers built roadhouses every 10, 15 or 20 miles,
usually a day's dog-sled journey in winter. (The harsh weather was
actually easier to travel in because the snow cover made pulling
heavy sleds practical. In warmer months, the sodden muskeg and open
rivers were much harder to traverse with heavy mining machinery and
furniture.)</TE>
<TE>   The roadhouses weren't fancy: bunk beds with spruce boughs for
mattresses or a bare corner to throw your bedroll in. According to
one early chronicle, guests at a dirt-floor log roadhouse were served
an alleged rabbit stew from a large kerosene can that was permanently
settled on an old stove. As the contents thinned with each new diner,
more water, rabbit, caribou, lynx or bear--whatever was around--was
tossed into the pot.</TE>
<TE>   Other roadhouses were more refined. And some persevered through
the early automobile years to become fishing and hunting camps.</TE>
<TE>   Today, only a few of the originals survive, but their relics are
easily spotted if you look for them, particularly on the Richardson
Highway, which runs from Valdez to Fairbanks. Several are listed on
the National Park Service's Register of Historic Places. Some have
become museums, and at least two I found still take overnight guests.</TE>
<TE>   Fairbanks is a good jumping-off point for any search for Alaska's
historic roadhouses. I had already decided to stay at the modern
equivalent of these old hostelries: a bed-and-breakfast. Using the
Internet, I had selected what turned out to be an uninspired choice,
so I soon was grilling the locals at the Miner's Restaurant &amp; Saloon.
One big, affable guy recommended a bed-and-breakfast he knew. He and
his female companion were headed that direction on their motorcycle
and would show me the way. As they waved me into the driveway of the
7 Gables Inn and said goodbye from their Harley, I noticed the Hells
Angels logo on his jacket.</TE>
<TE>   It was a great recommendation. Immaculate, private, inexpensive,
with a big greenhouse as an entryway and walls of books, the 7 Gables
Inn is a favorite of visiting academics, European tourists and
sophisticated Alaskans coming in from the bush to pick up supplies.
Gourmet breakfasts are a big draw. One morning the menu was Chinese:
egg foo yong, Eight Treasures rice pudding, sausage star won tons,
Chinese almond cookies, banana fritters. The second day's breakfast
included almond raisin charoset with an apple slice, blintz souffle
with mixed berries, bagel, hash browns and apricot kugel.</TE>
<TE>   Heading south on the Richardson Highway from Fairbanks, the wide,
two-lane road runs through stands of white birch and black spruce,
often photogenically close to the Tanana River. I glimpsed remnants
of original roadhouses at the old yellow Salcha roadhouse, where the
Salcha River crosses the highway, as well as a wall or two of the
Richardson Roadhouse, now a modest motel.</TE>
<TE>   It takes a couple of hours to drive from Fairbanks to Big Delta,
where the trans-Alaska pipeline crosses the river. Big Delta is the
home of one of the more elaborate old inns, Rika's Roadhouse &amp;
Landing, once a stopover for trekkers headed to the gold fields of
Fairbanks. Today, Rika's, surrounded by a 10-acre park, is one of the
most beautifully restored original roadhouses in the state. The main,
two-story lodge has become a museum and gift shop. There's a modest
zoo--ducks, geese and the like--and a restaurant, known in these
parts for its buffet, in a newer building.</TE>
<TE>   About nine miles south, at Delta Junction, is another original,
the Sullivan Roadhouse, built around 1908 on the Donnelly-Washburn
winter sled trail and abandoned in 1922. In 1966, the U.S. Army
Legacy Fund, which preserves historic sites, moved the roadhouse
across the Tanana River and into the center of Delta Junction, and
it's now a nice little museum filled with hundreds of period
photographs. This roadhouse also is a good example of the original
exterior construction of many of these early lodges: unpeeled white
spruce logs, the spaces between chinked with moss. Sod roofs were
later replaced with metal ones.</TE>
<TE>   Iturned south, keeping to the Richardson Highway, and soaked up
the raw beauty of the drive into the central Alaska Range. One moment
you drive alongside the Delta River. The next, the trans-Alaska
pipeline peeps into view. Not quite 40 miles later, I paused at the
ruins of the Black Rapids Roadhouse, now aflutter with yellow
construction ribbons and other signs of new life.</TE>
<TE>   This inn, which was nearly overrun in 1937 by the glacier I would
be visiting, was recently listed on the Park Service register and is
being restored as a museum and Alaskan art shop.</TE>
<TE>   "We're one of the last remaining of the 33 original roadhouses
along the Valdez-Fairbanks Trail," Annie Hopper said over a plate of
delectable halibut one evening. "That's why it's so important to
preserve it." We were in the kitchen of her handsome home in the
woods around Fairbanks, talking about the plans that she, her
husband, Michael, and Rich Landon, a co-owner from Colorado, were
making to restore this 1902 roadhouse, 38 miles south of Delta
Junction. The work began this summer, using volunteer labor and a
$50,000 grant from Alaska's Office of History and Archeology.</TE>
<TE>   The Black Rapids Roadhouse, Hopper told me, was accommodating
travelers into the 1990s, long after many of these earliest lodges
had closed or burned down--dangerous old stoves and faulty wiring
took a toll--or were replaced by newer structures.</TE>
<TE>   The Black Rapids occupies a unique place in Alaskan history: It
was nearly destroyed by what many still call the Galloping Glacier.
In the stormy winter of 1936-37, a family living in the lodge was
surprised to discover that the snout of Black Rapids Glacier, more
than a mile wide and up to 300 feet tall, was suddenly bearing down
on them. A few glaciers sometimes speed up, advancing as much as 100
times their normal rate for a brief period. Black Rapids pushed
forward an estimated 220 feet (two-thirds of a football field) daily
during the 1937 surge. It stopped about a mile from the roadhouse, on
the other side of the Delta River. Glaciologists later learned that
in ages past it had gone much farther, grinding over the river and
the current roadhouse site.</TE>
<TE>   I pressed on down the trail, planning to spend the evening at the
Paxson Inn &amp; Lodge, which I had been told was a "beautiful old
roadhouse."</TE>
<TE>   Beauty is relative, and what is undoubtedly attractive to a
fishing aficionado or hunter was a tad bedraggled to me. It turned
out that the original roadhouse burned in 1966. This big,
camper-casual place, with its overheated rooms, was built in 1958.
The owners are slowly upgrading the place, but they have their work
cut out.</TE>
<TE>   I should have stayed up the road in the L.L. Bean-neat new cabins
of Paxson Alpine Tours and Cabins, which have an impressive view of
Mt. Paxson and are quiet except for the sound of the nearby Gulkana
River. Audie Bakewell--formally, Audubon L. Bakewell IV, a geologist
by training and originally from New Hampshire--handed me a cup of
fresh coffee and showed me around. A respected guide and writer on
birds and other local wildlife, Bakewell conducts floating tours into
the Paxson Reserve to see the big guys--moose and grizzlies--as well
as bird-watching hikes; dog-sled, bicycle and canoe expeditions. He
cheerfully pointed out--"See, right up there on that dark branch!"--a
bald eagle preening across the river.</TE>
<TE>   With some reluctance, I got back in the car and again headed
south. The road gets a bit rougher here, with the occasional pothole
and unexpected dip, although nothing an ordinary car can't handle.
And the scenery is extraordinary.</TE>
<TE>   Reminders of the old roadhouses kept popping up. About 20 miles
down the road, the fairly new "rustic" cabins of the Meier's Lake
Roadhouse appear. It includes a convenience store and homey
restaurant and bar catering to hikers, salmon fishers and
cross-country skiers. Twenty-five more miles south is the Sourdough
Roadhouse, which still has two old cabins from the original 1903
complex. The new building is now a country restaurant claiming a
sourdough starter dating from 1896.</TE>
<TE>   I found my first early roadhouse that still takes guests less than
20 miles farther south, a couple of miles off the Richardson Highway
on the Glenn Highway, heading to Tok. (Just across the Gakona River
is Gakona Lodge and Trading Post, a seven-acre historic district with
11 original buildings, including the impressive two-story log main
lodge that dates from the late 1920s. The first roadhouse, ice house
and storage shed from the 1904 inn still exist as well. The old
carriage house has been converted to a restaurant of the same name,
serving locally admired American food. The Trapper's Den bar, built
in the 1940s by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as an equipment
shed, is now a comfortable place for a nightcap.</TE>
<TE>   I passed through before the lodge's Memorial Day opening, but
Barbara Strang, co-owner with her husband, Jerry, gave me a look at
the lobby, small store and guest rooms. They have removed much of the
later remodeling, exposing original log walls in many places. The
rooms are small, built to frontier standards but prettily attired in
bold-colored curtains and linens.</TE>
<TE>   The other nicely restored roadhouse I ran across that's still
taking overnight guests is at Copper Center, back on the Richardson
Highway and south of the junction with the Glenn Highway. The current
Copper Center Lodge was built in 1932 on the site of the older Blix
Roadhouse, a popular stop in the late 1890s. It's a beautiful,
two-story log building with a restaurant on the ground floor. Copper
Center was a base for the effort at the turn of the last century to
bring communications to Alaskans. The Washington-Alaska Military
Cable and Telegraph System, whose intrepid labor crews were known as
the WAMCATS, set up a telegraph system between Valdez and Fairbanks
and upgraded the vital link to the interior that would later be
renamed the Richardson Highway. The WAMCATS, as had so many before
them, found a warm bunk and refreshment at night at the motley
collection of early roadhouses along the trail.</TE>

<HD>For Relaxation and Reverie, Sometimes a Train Trip Is the
Only Way to Fly</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>SUSAN SPANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like many travelers, I have been following the debate about the
future of our national passenger railway system. I listened to
pundits say that the rail system, which loses millions every year,
should die off, like the dinosaurs, and to others with expensive
plans to get it back on its wheels.</LD>
<LD>   Mostly, though, I thought of train trips I have taken here and
abroad, all experiences I feel lucky to have had.</LD>
<LD>   I once ditched a dreary, poorly run camping tour in Alaska and
caught the railway from Denali to Anchorage. I drank white wine and
ate a salmon steak in the dining car as the train passed a moose.</LD>
<TE>   I have ridden from Auckland to Wellington on the cozy railways of
New Zealand, privately owned at the time but federalized last year,
and I have taken an overnight train from Beijing to Xian, bunking
above a Chinese policeman. Just last month I sampled Switzerland's
efficient railroad system, which is part private, part federal.</TE>
<TE>   Most memorable was a three-day train trip I took in 1996 on
Amtrak's Pioneer from Denver to Portland, Ore. I boarded in Denver's
handsome Union Station, went coach to save money, sleeping in my seat
amid fretful babies and rambunctious Boy Scouts, ate microwave meals
and had to catch trains in the wee hours of the morning.</TE>
<TE>   The train roughly followed the Oregon Trail, across southern Idaho
and eastern Oregon, before joining the Columbia River in its wild
rush to the sea. An appreciation for the beauty of the country,
especially its tiny whistle-stops, and the extraordinary
accomplishments of the pioneers welled up in me whenever I looked out
the window. But the train was hours, not minutes, late at most stops
and slowed to a crawl outside Portland. On the last leg of the trip,
I read in a newspaper that Amtrak had discontinued the Pioneer
because of low ridership and passenger revenue.</TE>
<TE>   This train experience compels me most when I think about Amtrak
and the highly politicized debate that surrounds its fate. Since the
system's inception in 1971, the only parts of it that have shown
growth are the coast corridors in the Northeast and West. (Ridership
on the Surfliner between San Luis Obispo and San Diego increased 9%
last year.)</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak's long-haul intercity lines--with names that send tingles
down a traveler's spine, like the Silver Meteor (from Boston to
Jacksonville, Fla.), the California Zephyr (from Chicago to San
Francisco) and the Sunset Limited (from Orlando, Fla., to L.A.)--lost
$304 million last year, according to an inspector general's report.
When Amtrak made a bold leap--adding high-speed Acela trains to the
Northeast corridor--their debut was delayed and their speeds proved
rarely as fast as those of their European counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   France presented the model for high-speed, long-distance railways
with the 1981 institution of the Train a Grand Vitesse. High-speed
trains run regularly in France, from Paris to Brittany, Tours,
Marseille and the Channel Tunnel. The efficient, environmentally
sound, scenic rail system cost the French state about $15 billion
compared with the $1.2 billion requested by Amtrak to run American
passenger railroads in 2003, with money-saving improvements but no
fundamental changes.</TE>
<TE>   Switzerland excels in the integration of its railway lines with
buses, ferry boats and even ski lifts. There are train stations at
airports to make transfers easy. As a result, I was able to fly
overnight to Zurich from Washington, D.C., and catch a train at the
airport to my ultimate destination, the Alpine village of Zermatt, a
six-hour ride.</TE>
<TE>   As it stands now, you can't take a train directly from LAX to
downtown Los Angeles or from JFK in New York directly to Manhattan.
Having traveled much in Europe, I am convinced that Europe has a
better public transportation system than the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   My hope that American passenger rail service--especially the
long-haul segments like the erstwhile Pioneer--won't go the way of
the dinosaurs isn't really about keeping up with Europe. It comes
from my love of travel and my sense that trains provide a way to see
the landscape unlike any other, partly because the tracks were laid
in particularly scenic corridors. In "Trains of Discovery," author
and railway historian Alfred Runte says that trains were instrumental
in the formation and promotion of our national parks. There's a
deeply therapeutic train state of mind, I think, that sets in after
you have stared out the window for a time, drinking in the scenery.</TE>
<TE>   Max Biegert, who owns the tourist railway that runs from Williams,
Ariz., to the Grand Canyon, says that passenger railroads are always
losing propositions that must be state subsidized. They can't compete
with the airlines, which turn a plane seat half a dozen times in the
24 hours it takes a train to go the same distance.</TE>
<TE>   He's no train buff. In fact, he ended up with the Grand Canyon
Railway by accident, when a loan went bad. He was ready to pull up
the tracks and sell off the ties, but the people of Williams begged
him to save the historic line. Almost 15 years later, the Grand
Canyon Railway, which receives no federal or state funding, still
doesn't run in the black but is considered profitable because it
brings business to the Fray Marcos Hotel in Williams, also owned by
Biegert's company.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Biegert and others would mourn the loss of long-distance
passenger trains. But is this enough reason to spend the billions of
taxpayer dollars required to maintain long-haul passenger railways? I
don't know. All I can say is that when it comes right down to it,
I've never had a bad train ride.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Take a voyage into history with a fall cruise along the Columbia
River Gorge that will follow the path taken by early 19th century
explorers Lewis and Clark.</LD>
<LD>   The seven-day expedition begins and ends in Portland, Ore., where
travelers board a 70-passenger ship that wends its way through some
of the regions explored by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark and
their Corps of Discovery nearly 200 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   At the request of President Jefferson, the explorers traveled
thousands of miles, searching for a northwest passage--a river or
series of connected rivers that would cross the Western mountains and
reach the Pacific Ocean.</LD>
<TE>   The Lindblad Expeditions cruise will reverse the Lewis and Clark
journey, traveling from the mouth of the Columbia River to Idaho,
more than 450 miles upstream. Along the route, the ship will traverse
the locks of the Columbia, visit Astoria, Ore., and sail up the Snake
River. The group will visit Hells Canyon, Idaho, by jet boat.</TE>
<TE>   Inflatable Zodiac boats and kayaks are often used to explore
remote shorelines and regions such as the Palouse River, a tributary
of the Snake River.</TE>
<TE>   Historians and naturalists will act as guides.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: Rates begin at $1,793 per person, double occupancy, for
sailings Oct. 30 and 31 or Nov. 5 and 6. Other departures are planned
between Sept. 30 and Oct. 25, beginning at $2,390 per person. Air
fare to Portland is not included.</TE>

<HD>Unearthing a Hidden Jewel in Tuscany</HD>
<DH>A converted villa makes a good base for exploring Pistoia,
long overshadowed by Florence</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RAY MOSELEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PISTOIA, Italy</DL>
<LD>The guidebook had let us down badly in the choice of a hotel at Lake
Garda, and now we were heading south to Pistoia in Tuscany and
certain doom. The next hotel on our itinerary had come from the same
wretched book.</LD>
<LD>   "This place we're going to is so bad," I joked to my wife,
Jennifer, "that the Italian government has tried to house refugees in
it and they refuse to go."</LD>
<LD>   The decision to visit this less traveled part of Tuscany had been
a gamble in more ways than one. On our mid-May trip, we could have
gone to Chianti country, with its incomparable hills, imposing villas
and cedars standing like sentinels over endless stretches of
vineyard. We could have gone to the more popular cities of Florence,
Siena, San Gimignano, Lucca or Pisa. But we decided to forgo known
pleasures for a Tuscany untouched by hordes of tourists. Another
guidebook--a cultural guide--had suggested that Pistoia, 21 miles
northwest of Florence, was not without its charms. So we were headed
into the unknown and, to make matters more unnerving, we had
persuaded two friends, Paul and Mimi Horne, to join us at the Villa
Vannini, the country house hotel recommended in the first guidebook.</LD>
<TE>   Fortunately, even bad guidebooks can sometimes redeem their worst
mistakes, and the best ones prove their worth. In Pistoia and Villa
Vannini, our luck turned.</TE>
<TE>   The Villa Vannini is perched on an Apennine hilltop, 1,000 feet up
and four miles north of Pistoia, and our first sight of it was
reassuring. Built in 1780 and used as a summer residence of nobility
from Florence and Pistoia during the 18th and 19th centuries, it is a
three-story hostelry with only eight bedrooms, all tastefully
furnished with antiques. A large terrace on one side of the building
is surrounded by linden trees and oaks, and just beyond, dominating
the landscape, stands a magnificent deodar, a Himalayan cedar.</TE>
<TE>   The bedrooms are simple and lack the features that many travelers
take for granted. There are no telephones in the rooms, no TV sets,
no radios. Each room has its own bath, but only two are attached; the
rest are across a corridor. There is no elevator to the upper floors
and no air-conditioning. The villa is clean and comfortable, but not
a place that spoils with little luxuries in the bedrooms.</TE>
<TE>   What makes the Villa Vannini exceptional is its restaurant, the
Deodora, named for the cedar. Luigi and Marta Bordonaro, a friendly
couple from Pisa, manage the villa for its elderly owner, Maria Rosa
Vannini. Luigi is not simply an excellent self-taught chef; he is a
culinary maestro, a magician who gives traditional Tuscan dishes a
modern and innovative touch that is consistently outstanding. Marta
makes the dough for the pastas, bread and desserts, and they match
the quality of Luigi's cooking. All four in our party have had years
of experience in Italy, and we unanimously agreed we had never dined
as well.</TE>
<TE>   Each dinner consists of four courses, so well balanced that you
never get up from the table feeling you have eaten too much. A
typical menu: chicken terrine with a small salad of marinated onions;
pappardelle (extra-wide noodles) with zucchini flowers; Cinta Senese,
a small, richly flavored pig native to the Siena region, braised in
Chianti with sage-flavored mashed potatoes; and Marta's crema
caramellata with a prune on top, which was a cross between a creme
caramel and a creme brulee--and superior to both.</TE>
<TE>   On the night after this meal, the second course was unusual:
ravioli of Cinta Senese placed in the fold of a cloth napkin. Luigi
believes that sauces served with ravioli detract from the flavor of
their meat, so he serves them in a napkin to preserve moistness and
heat. Delicious. Another of my favorites was pappardelle with rabbit,
duck and cockerel.</TE>
<TE>   The Bordonaros stock only Tuscan wines, most in the $20 range but
some double that or more. The modestly priced wines were uniformly
good so we stayed with them, mainly Rosso di Montalcino Brunelli 2000
and Nobile di Montepulciano Salcheto 1998 or 2000. For our one fish
dinner (six different fish or shellfish in four courses), Marta chose
for us one of the few good Tuscan whites, I Sistri Chardonnay Felsina
1999.</TE>
<TE>   We approached the Deodora with a measure of skepticism, committed
to having only one meal there. Within reasonable driving distance,
there are at least four Michelin one-star restaurants. But after our
first night at the Deodora, there was never any question of where we
would eat the rest of our dinners. With one exception.</TE>
<TE>   Before coming to Villa Vannini, the Bordonaros ran a restaurant
called La Volpe e l'Uva (the Fox and the Grape) in the mountain
village of Buti, between Pistoia and Pisa. It's now in the hands of
their daughters, Francesca and Chiara, and it has won rave reviews in
several Italian publications, and even one in Japan. Luigi taught
Francesca and claims she is now a better cook than he. So at his
insistence, we dined at La Volpe one night. We agreed Francesca is a
superb cook, but her menu lacked the delicate balance found at the
Deodora. Still, La Volpe is worth a detour.</TE>
<TE>   Pistoia is an excellent base for visiting Lucca, 30 miles to the
west, Pisa, 15 more miles beyond, and Florence. Also within striking
distance are two villas built by Florence's ruling Renaissance
family, the Medicis. At the village of Poggio a Caiano, halfway along
the road to Florence, is a villa that was built for Lorenzo the
Magnificent by Giuliano da Sangallo in the 15th century and decorated
under the guidance of Lorenzo's son, Pope Leo X. Near Carmignano,
south of Pistoia, is the Medici Villa di Artimino, built by Bernardo
Buontalenti in 1594 for Ferdinand I, Grand Duke of Tuscany at the
time. Although the villas are open to tours, we didn't visit them,
instead heading for Pistoia.</TE>
<TE>   The approach to Pistoia is anything but inviting. Pistoia and
nearby Prato are the heart of Europe's largest plant nursery
development, and buyers from all over the world come to this town of
90,000, which, at first glance, appears to consist only of drab
modern buildings. But once you penetrate the medieval town center,
that perception changes. A local guidebook proclaims defensively but
appositely that Pistoia is an "unknown jewel."</TE>
<TE>   Living in the shadow of Florence, Pistoia never had any
possibility of rivaling that great center of art, Renaissance culture
and power politics. But in the Middle Ages, when the town was caught
up in the struggle between the Guelphs (the party of the pope) and
the Ghibellines (the aristocrats who supported the German emperors),
Pistoia was a prosperous little town. Its wealth was swelled by
pilgrims who came to pay homage to a relic of St. Jacopo, brought
from Spanish Galicia in 1144.</TE>
<TE>   Originally a 3rd century BC Roman settlement, Pistoia was
conquered by the Lombards in the late 6th century, then became part
of the Carolingian Empire in the 9th century. In 1351 it lost its
independence to Florence.</TE>
<TE>   Today, you can easily imagine what a lively place it was in the
Middle Ages--with artists and architects pouring into it from Pisa,
Florence and Siena to adorn it with those unknown jewels that
distinguish it today, wealthy families busily weaving Machiavellian
plots, ordinary citizens manning the ramparts against neighboring
enemies. Few of the artists who came here achieved lasting fame, but
what they left behind is remarkable.</TE>
<TE>   The most striking of the Pistoian jewels are the 12th century
cathedral of St. Zeno, built in a Pisan Romanesque style that was
handsomely restored in 1999; its 220-foot bell tower; and its
stunning octagonal Gothic baptistery. These form the principal
components of one of the finest piazzas in Italy, complemented at
opposite ends by the 14th century law courts, once the governor's
palace, and the 13th century town hall, which houses a civic museum
featuring outstanding Florentine and Sienese works of art from the
14th to 16th centuries.</TE>
<TE>   The 14th century Baptistery of St. John, like parts of the
cathedral and bell tower, consists of alternating layers of white and
green marble, reminiscent of the cathedral in Siena. It was designed
by Andrea Pisano, a member of a Pisan artistic family that left its
imprint on monuments throughout Pistoia.</TE>
<TE>   A lunette in the portico of the cathedral holds a terra cotta of
the "Madonna and Child," by Andrea Della Robbia, and the coffered
tunnel vault of the church is also decorated with his work. But the
pride of the cathedral is a silver altar, mentioned in Dante's
"Divine Comedy," which features 628 small figures designed by various
artists over several centuries.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the cathedral square is the Piazza della Sala, whose
outdoor food market bustles with vendors and shoppers gathered around
bountiful displays of fresh fruits and vegetables. (But a word of
caution: Stay out of Pistoia on Saturdays, when the cathedral square
and many nearby streets are taken over by a tacky outdoor clothing
market.)</TE>
<TE>   Go out the opposite end of the cathedral square from Piazza della
Sala and you will descend along medieval streets to one of Pistoia's
unexpected pleasures: the 15th century Ospedale del Ceppo (Hospital
of the Tree Stump), named for the stump in which alms were once
collected. The Florentine-style portico is decorated with a series of
colorful glazed terra cottas from the Della Robbia school, portraying
familiar scenes of medieval life and death. Scattered throughout the
town, all within walking distance, are splendid old palazzi, once the
homes of powerful Pistoia families, and churches dating from the
Middle Ages to the Renaissance. After the cathedral, most prominent
is the small Church of Sant'Andrea (St. Andrew), which also has a
green and white marble Pisan facade. The elaborately carved marble
pulpit, supported by six red porphyry columns resting on the backs of
lions, is one of the masterpieces of Giovanni Pisano. The artist's
two original lecterns of the pulpit are now scattered--one at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the other at the Museum
Dahlem in Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   My favorite among the churches is St. John Fuorcivitas, another
Romanesque building in white and green marble. Although the church is
in the heart of Pistoia, the word fuorcivitas indicates it was built
outside the now-vanished medieval walls. Its exterior design is
perhaps the most handsome in town. Inside, its main adornment is a
"Visitation" by Luca Della Robbia, depicting a meeting between the
Virgin Mary and St. Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist.</TE>
<TE>   Also worth visiting is the 15th century Basilica of the Madonna
dell'Umilta, Pistoia's principal church in Renaissance style. Its
massive dome, designed by Giorgio Vasari and clearly inspired by
Filippo Brunelleschi's dome for the Cathedral of Santa Maria del
Fiore in Florence, is the third largest in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Pistoia will, of course, never compete with the great towns and
cities of Tuscany. But that is one of its virtues. When we were
there, there were no tour buses, no guides leading battalion-size
groups through the streets. Just a few tourists, quietly relishing
the pleasures of a town out of the Middle Ages that never managed to
achieve the greatness of its neighbors, yet in its time of glory
created a legacy of enduring beauty.</TE>

<LD>Brazil, the land of samba and soccer, rain forests and magnificent
beaches, can be a challenge for independent budget travelers.</LD>
<LD>   "If travelers don't speak Portuguese or have Brazilian friends,"
says Brazilian Joao Pedro Borges Badue, "it can be hard to get around
Brazil with just a guidebook." Add to that a fear of crime in popular
tourist sites and shantytowns. (During my visit, I saw a T-shirt
making fun of Rio's crime rate: "I left my heart in Rio--and my ring,
and my watch, and my camera.")</LD>
<LD>   But Badue found a way to make independent travelers more
comfortable in his native country. In 2001 Badue launched the South
America Experience, the newest expansion of the popular backpacker
bus service Kiwi Experience and Oz Experience (based in New Zealand
and Australia, respectively). Down Under, the two companies carry
80,000 passengers each year. The budget-priced transportation
services enable travelers to maintain flexible schedules but provide
assistance with information and accommodations, and are a good way to
meet other like-minded adventurers.</LD>
<TE>   The South America Experience is operating four modern,
air-conditioned buses in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Bahia. Nine
different passes are available for routes from one to 12 days long.
You can hop on and off as you choose, stretching your trip for as
long as six months. Each bus has an English-speaking guide accredited
by Brazil Tourism who will explain the culture and history along the
route, help arrange activities from hang-gliding to rock climbing,
and book accommodation. Passengers are dropped off each evening at
local pousadas and hostels. The pousadas average $12 to $15 per
person per night for a double or twin private room. Hostels average
$8 for a bed in a dormitory room. If you decide to stay more than one
night at any stop, you can catch the next bus. Stops are served three
times a week.</TE>
<TE>   The most popular pass is the Route Copacabana, which you can
purchase before you leave the United States, for $109 at STA Travel;
(800) 781-404, www.statravel.com.</TE>
<TE>   The route takes a minimum of four days to travel, but to enjoy it
the company recommends you plan on at least eight days. It starts in
Rio's popular beach area, Copacabana. The first stop is a walking
tour of Rocinha, the largest favela (shantytown) in South America,
then the bus travels a coastal route past rain forests. After a lunch
at Angra dos Reis, travelers can break away for a few days and catch
a ferry ($1) to Ilha Grande to hike, relax and enjoy the beaches. The
bus continues to Parati, where there's time to explore its beautiful
historic center and spend the night. Then there is a visit to a
coffee farm, and the opportunities to climb, hike or rappel and enjoy
the spectacular mountainous scenery inland. The next stops are the
historic city of Petropolis and Buzios, which has cobblestone
streets, 17 beaches and restaurants and nightlife. Buzios is a
favorite weekend getaway for Rio residents. The final leg is another
coastal run, with stops at swim and surf spots on the way back to
Rio.</TE>
<TE>   If you're not sure if South America Experience is right for you,
try the company's one-day Rio city tour. Rio can be intimidating to
explore solo, and the $26 tour provides a good introduction. Its
first stop is in Tijuca National Park, where passengers can take an
easy 40-minute hike to a lookout to watch or try hang-gliding (for an
extra charge). Then, it's back to town for lunch in one of the city's
historic districts, Santa Teresa; the last stop is at the Christ the
Redeemer statue high above the city.</TE>
<TE>   South America Experience has offices in Sao Paulo, Salvador and at
36 Rua Raimundo Correa in Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana district;

also has 10 computers for travelers to use. Special promotions give
pass holders some free Internet time.</TE>

<HD>The Road to Perdition</HD>
<DH>THE OUTFIT: The Role of Chicago's Underworld in the Shaping
of Modern America, By Gus Russo, Bloomsbury: 552 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURENCE BERGREEN</AU>
<BD>Laurence Bergreen is the author of "Capone: The Man and
the Era."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For students of the gangster life, the chief satisfaction of Gus
Russo's enormous chronicle, "The Outfit: The Role of Chicago's
Underworld in the Shaping of Modern America," will be the lavish
attention paid to the Chicago mobsters who came after the heyday of
Al Capone. Russo demonstrates that Capone's successors, though less
storied than that 1920s icon, were equally colorful and eccentric and
that their dealings in a post-Prohibition world were vastly more
labyrinthine and sophisticated.</LD>
<LD>   Chicago civic boosterism has long held that the city's lawless
days, when the machine gun ruled and politicians belonged to
racketeers, was strictly a Jazz Age aberration, but as Russo makes
abundantly and embarrassingly clear, organized crime persisted in
Chicago for decades. Once Capone and his mentor, Johnny Torrio, the
father of American corporate crime, laid the groundwork, succeeding
generations of gangsters built and maintained the Outfit, as the
remarkably durable, one-size-fits-all racketeering organization came
to be called. The Outfit insinuated itself into Chicago's
infrastructure and achieved a legitimacy that Capone and his
associates could only imagine; its influence reached Las Vegas and
Hollywood, but it remained a quintessentially Chicago institution.
Russo convincingly demonstrates that the road to perdition lasted at
least until the 1960s.</LD>
<TE>   This idea, which Russo drives home with grim zeal, is one that
today's civic leaders would rather forget, as I learned when I was at
work on my biography of Capone. In the course of my research, I went
to see one of the city fathers, a man whose trophy-filled office was
a monument to himself. "What's a nice boy like you doing writing
about gangsters?" he challenged. "Why don't you write about Chicago's
museums, symphonies and parks?" Nevertheless, in spite of his, and
others', protestations, Chicago's reputation for inspiring an amazing
variety of gangster activity stubbornly clings to the city.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to recent books about crime, which emphasize the
warped sensibilities of the criminals themselves, "The Outfit" is a
throwback to an earlier era of crime writing, the hairy-chested,
comprehensive, now-it-can-be-told indictments compiled by writers
like Hank Messick, Virgil Peterson and Ovid Demaris. Russo had access
to "eighty-seven cubic feet of documents" generated by the U.S.
Senate's 1950-51 committee inquiry into organized crime led by Sen.
Estes Kefauver of Tennessee. (One of the ironies of organized crime
is how much material concerning its supposedly secret machinations is
in the public record, thanks to FBI wiretaps and the Freedom of
Information Act. Would that we knew as much about the inner workings
of the White House as we do about various sit-downs among Chicago
hoodlums.)</TE>
<TE>   With his attention to detail, Russo is at his best when he
patiently deconstructs the careers of such Outfit figures as the
demonic hoodlum Willie Bioff ("an evolutionary malfunction"), who
terrorized the motion picture industry; Sam Giancana, perhaps the
most reckless figure in a book filled with sociopaths; and especially
Murray "The Camel" Humphreys, the Outfit's mastermind, who was in
many ways a more influential and certainly shrewder criminal than his
mentor, Capone. I have never read a better, or more exhaustive,
account of how these men built their empires and how they lost them.
(Most gangster stories end in tragedy, as "The Outfit" demonstrates
over and over.)</TE>
<TE>   But Russo gets into trouble when his assumptions run too far ahead
of the facts. This book is by no means the first to link Joseph P.
Kennedy, the patriarch of the Kennedy clan, to bootlegging and to
various schemes to manipulate the 1960 presidential campaign in his
son's favor. Russo cites every bit of evidence that he can muster to
support his contention that Kennedy and the Outfit conspired to
influence the voting, but the case, while thought-provoking, remains
largely circumstantial. Nevertheless, the moral passion behind the
author's account of that controversial election is impressive.</TE>
<TE>   I wish I could admire Russo's style as much as I do his substance.
Reaching for tough-guy eloquence, he trips all over himself: "Torrio
guessed that Capone was a train wreck just waiting to happen and
decided to bail out and hitch his wagon to an idea that dwarfed even
the Torrio-Capone Syndicate: an affiliation with New York gangsters
Meyer Lansky, Ben Siegel, and Lucky Luciano." Anecdotes are related
with a singular lack of flair. I was surprised to learn, for example,
of Humphreys' curious fascination with producing home movies; The
Camel even made a home movie at Alcatraz, of all places,
"sarcastically dubbing the track with the popular song 'Hail. Hail,
the Gang's All Here.' " I wanted to know more; but the author seemed
so preoccupied with getting out his data that he neglected to suggest
what it all means.</TE>
<TE>   The book's methodology would have benefited from more careful
consideration. In this account, Russo seems to give all sources equal
weight, whether they are FBI wiretap transcripts, newspaper
clippings, court transcripts, interviews conducted by the author or
hearsay. With so much data at hand, some of it carefully considered
and accurate but much of it spurious, Russo often resorts to taking
hearsay as fact. At one point, Russo appears to accept Luciano's
explanation for Franklin D. Roosevelt's decision to call off an
investigation into organized crime, although Luciano is no one's idea
of a reliable source.</TE>
<TE>   To make matters a little worse, "The Outfit," for all its
research, does not include endnotes or footnotes; reading the book, I
wondered time and again, "Where is he getting this stuff?" The list
of sources at the end provides a rough guide, but the author often
fails to link quotations and incidents throughout the book to
specific sources. I do not believe Russo wanted to obscure his
sources, which are impressive, but he missed an important step in
documenting them.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these caveats, "The Outfit's" exhaustive reporting and
comprehensive analysis of Chicago's criminal culture make the book
one of the essential works on the subject of organized crime.
Virtually every tale told about the Outfit can be found here.
Criminologists will consult it for decades, and general readers who
follow Russo to the end will think twice the next time they buy a
movie ticket or cast a ballot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `The Outfit'</TE>
<TE>   For those Americans not in denial of their history, the term
organized crime has always meant something other than Al Capone,
Mooney Giancana or Meyer Lansky. Without doubt , the best organized
crime in the United States is a coalition of upperworld businessmen,
pliant politicians and corrupted law enforcement officers.
"Corruption is as American as cherry pie," wrote author and former
Senate staff member Nathan Miller. "Graft and corruption played a
vital role in the development of modern American society and the
creation of the complex, interlocking machinery of government and
business that determines the course of our affairs."</TE>
<TE>   The crimes of this shadowy partnership surpass in spades the
criminal escapades of underworld cliques like Chicago's Outfit.
However, this very upperworld paradigm gives both rationale and
inspiration to the underworld gangsters we choose to vilify in their
stead. As a society we no longer have to purchase our vices from
gangsters: We can merely sit at home and, thanks to the General
Motors-owned DirecTV, have pornography delivered straight to our
television sets (or to our Hilton Hotel room in Vegas); through
state-sponsored commercials, we are enticed to play the G's lottery,
a game so tilted in the state's favor as to make the hoods' numbers
racket seem like charity.</TE>

<HD>'Real Exact': Freeze-Frame L.A.</HD>
<DH>Remembering James Doolin and the luminous quality of his
life and work</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER CAREY</AU>
<BD>Peter Carey is the author of several novels, including
"True History of the Kelly Gang," "Jack Maggs" and "Oscar and
Lucinda."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the painter James Doolin died last week, suddenly at 70, I lost
not only a friend but also an important teacher. By this I do not
simply mean that he taught me, an inward-looking writer, to peer
outward at, say, a window frame or a Corot, or that he persuaded me
that the freeways of Los Angeles were the most important sculptures
of our time or that he could introduce me (in a painting like
"Interchange") to a wild sort of ecstasy, a soaring of the spirit
that might seem at first at variance with his often-stated desire to
makes things "real exact."</LD>
<LD>   It may be difficult to see how a painter might teach a writer. He
did have some tough things to say about my earliest, blessedly
unpublished, work, and his points were good ones, but his most
important teaching was the intensely moral example of his life. This
was a man who would continue in the face of misunderstanding and dull
provincial criticism, who would never do anything expedient, who
would continue a path that took him well beyond the boulevards of
fashion, and if no one noticed what he was doing in the alleyway,
well, that was what his life would be.</LD>
<TE>   Artists of course are meant to be like this, but in fact such
individuals are rare, and sometimes, watching Jim, it was hard not to
wish he might become more "reasonable." I had known him for two years
in Melbourne, Australia, but in 1967 he returned to the States, to
Los Angeles. From here he wrote me a series of letters, each one more
pessimistic than the last. Of L.A., he wrote in an almost apocalyptic
tone: If the world was going to end, at least he had a ringside seat.</TE>
<TE>   The work he had produced in Australia had been entirely abstract,
and he is still known and celebrated there for the influence he had
on an entire generation of painters.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, he suddenly threw abstraction away. He spent three
(some say four) years working on a huge conceptualized painting of a
Santa Monica shopping center. In describing this painting to me, he
never made it sound anything other than "real exact." A shopping
center? It seemed like self-destructive madness to me. So it was with
some surprise that I discovered, years later, a work of breathtaking
beauty. Why had I not been ready for this, how could I have been so
slow to understand that my friend was making hymns to life?</TE>
<TE>   Naturally I have my excuses. Jim's refusal to compromise could
make him stern and judgmental. Sometimes, when he had criticized my
life in a letter, I thought he was like Savonarola, sternly
consigning the vanities to the flames. Certainly when he painted
those ecstatic freeways, he was also recording structures that he saw
most clearly as ruins, as what remained after the Fire Next Time.
Visiting the Mohave Desert with him, I saw that a great deal of its
appeal was the evidence, everywhere, of its triumph over human dreams
and vanities.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even at his most iconoclastic, one could never doubt his
kindness, his enormous generosity, his complexity. It is not
surprising that he had been a passionate admirer of Ad Reinhardt's
black paintings, but as a teenager, he ran for election in high
school with a drawing of Donald Duck and the slogan "If Jim Doolin
Can Do This For Me, Just Think What He Could Do For You." These
influences are still alive in many of his masterworks: In his
paintings of L.A.'s Skid Row and in the bulbous pant-suited figures
of his nightmare Las Vegas, you can see both Walt Disney and
Savonarola struggling on the mat.</TE>
<TE>   Jim made a small and rather private portrait of his mother and
father. I don't really know the history of his conflicts with his
dad, only that Jim had run away from home to pursue his life in art.
Typically, this portrait is distinguished by the artist's refusal to
lie about a single thing, neither the aging father's grim New England
profile, nor the mother's worn and worried, beaten eyes, and yet the
whole glows with a quality that I can only call love, not love earned
easily or sentimentally, but love that glows all the more strongly
because it has been fought for. There is something in this luminous
quality that reminds me of the freeways, a radiant, rapturous
life-force which we have a right to expect from someone who was
always concerned to be "real exact."</TE>

<HD>Who Loves Ya, Baby?</HD>
<DH>THE BIRTH OF PLEASURE, By Carol Gilligan, Alfred A. Knopf.
256 pp. $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRY CASTLE</AU>
<BD>Terry Castle is the author of the forthcoming "Boss
Ladies, Watch Out! Essays on Women, Sex and Writing."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reading about other people's therapy sessions is even more boring
than having to listen to your friends' long and moronic dreams. In a
dream narrative there's usually a bit of comic phantasmagoria to mull
over for a second or two. ("And then I saw my cat wearing underpants!
Then he turned into Calista Flockhart--with polka-dot fur! Then there
was an avalanche and my father--no, it was really George Bush!--made
me do a nude hip-hop dance in the snow!") You muster the requisite
po-face and nod politely, even as the dreamer blathers on, agog over
the Deep Symbolic Meaning of It All.</LD>
<LD>   The therapy narrative, however, would seem to be inherently
stupefying. Here's feminist psychologist Carol Gilligan, former
professor of gender studies at Harvard and author of the influential
"In a Different Voice" (1982), describing (in "The Birth of
Pleasure") a session with "Dan," a hopelessly dreary computer
scientist who comes with his wife "Jude" for couples counseling at
the Cambridge Family Institute:</LD>
<TE>   "Looking at the sullen man sitting across from me, I think of a
child who feels unseen and unappreciated. He's holding out, I
suspect, and I wonder why. Dan loved his mother as a young boy. He
saw the human face behind the mask she wore and also her wish not to
be seen. I find myself wondering whether out of love for her, he
moved away from her so as not to see her. Did he sacrifice his
relationship with his mother out of his love for her? And was he
waiting for someone to see his sacrifice and appreciate his love?"</TE>
<TE>   Gee, professor Gilligan, you may be right! But let's hear more:</TE>
<TE>   "In moving away from his mother, he was protecting himself from
her abandonment of him (putting on her mask, hiding her face) and
also from her anger and her sadness. But in closing himself off from
her, he was also protecting her by not seeing what she did not want
people to see (her anger, her sadness, her imperfection), distancing
himself from her so as not to blow her cover. In this, he had been a
loving son. I say this to Dan, and Jude's face changes, softens; she
moves closer to him and starts to cry. Dan feels present for the
first time."</TE>
<TE>   Dan may be present, but the intelligent reader is half asleep. Who
cares about this stone-faced nincompoop? "Sons and Lovers" this
ain't.</TE>
<TE>   There are many such vignettes in "The Birth of Pleasure,"
Gilligan's new study of "love and the forces that stand in the way of
pleasure." The vignettes all seem to involve uptight
upper-middle-class "couples in crisis" and their offspring. The kids
have fashionable Baby Gap names such as Zoe, Gabe, Emma and Jake. (No
one is ever called Myrtle, Ty-Ree, Devonne or Spud in these kinds of
books.) The adults are all deeply mopey, having fallen prey--husbands
and wives alike--to what Gilligan calls the "trauma of patriarchy."
The trauma of patriarchy--a term she never explains--is what makes
little boys of 5 or 6 reject their mothers, hanker after AK-47s and
"conceal those parts of themselves that are not considered to be
manly or heroic." In girls, says Gilligan, the trauma hits later, at
adolescence, when they realize--ka-boing!--that the world is ruled by
"the law of the Father." The law of the Father, in a nutshell, says
that girls are not allowed to do fun things, like have wild sex or
eat a lot. So girls learn to hide their desires for pleasure and
intimacy--for the "full openness and vulnerability of
relationship"--and then get hitched up to dopey emotionally stunted
men. Everyone ends up "dissociated" and boy, is that bad.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Gilligan sees a way out of the "parched desert" of human
relationships under patriarchy. The key to psychic health is
internalizing a new "myth of love"--one that undoes the hoary old
structures of "male domination" and repairs "longstanding ruptures
between people and between nations." Gilligan's already got the
perfect one picked out for us: the fable of Cupid and Psyche from
"The Golden Ass," a 2nd century work by the Latin writer Apuleius.</TE>
<TE>   The myth, for those whose Apuleius may have temporarily deserted
them, has to do with Psyche, a beautiful young Greek babe who arouses
the jealousy of the goddess Venus. To punish her, Venus orders her
son Cupid to make Psyche fall in love with some ugly guy. But Cupid
falls for her himself and whisks her off to a secret palace, where he
makes love to her every night, though without ever letting her see
his face. Eager to know the identity of her new boyfriend, with whom
she's, like, totally in love, Psyche (whose name means "soul") peeks
at him while he's sleeping and discovers he's a good-looking god. He
wakes up, however, and is upset about being seen. He flies back up to
Olympus, leaving her to the persecutions of Venus. When Psyche says
he'll never stop loving Cupid, Venus, in a rage, sets her a bunch of
loathsome tasks that make her go catatonic. All seems lost, but
Cupid, feeling remorseful, flies back down, snaps Psyche out of her
stupor and gets Jupiter, the boss god, to shut Venus up. With
Jupiter's blessing, Cupid and Psyche get married and Psyche gives
birth to a baby named Pleasure.</TE>
<TE>   Now this is a nice myth. Nobody murders his father by mistake or
beds his old mom; nobody has his eyes put out. (Gilligan dislikes
Freud's favorite story--the gory tale of Oedipus--because it
replicates the tragic "wounds of patriarchy.") The thing that's so
great about the Cupid-and-Psyche story is that Psyche is a really
righteous gal, kind of like Kate Winslett in "Titanic." She's feisty
and curious and she loves Cupe, even after he dumps her and Venus
gets on her case. She'd be happy to stand up on the prow of a ship
and dangle out over the waves. In fact she's a lot like the
adolescent girls whom Gilligan sees in her therapy work before, that
is, they get brainwashed by patriarchy. Before they squelch their
"real feelings" and turn into zombie-wives and zombie-mothers, they
are regular emotional geniuses. They are always "speaking truth to
power." They see everything that's going down--far more than boys
do--and they know that love conquers all. If we would only "listen to
their voices," we would all be a lot happier.</TE>
<TE>   Am I being harsh? Sarcastic? Possibly. But I can't be getting on
with the cartoonish psycho-twaddle that passes for argument in this
deeply confused book. Gilligan has been much praised--and rightly
so--for her clinical research on female adolescents. "The Birth of
Pleasure," however, is mere hodgepodge: a tedious concatenation of
feminist temporizing, cliched anecdotes from the consulting room,
maudlin personal reminiscences (we hear a lot about Gilligan's
darling Grandpa Poppy), random myth-weaving and lit-crit (there are
disjointed rambles on Shakespeare, Euripides and "Anne Frank: The
Diary of a Young Girl") and numerous pawky-sibylline utterances.
"Maybe love is like rain," intones Gilligan. "Sometimes gentle,
sometimes torrential, flooding, eroding, quiet, steady, filling the
earth, collecting in hidden springs. When it rains, when we love, new
life grows." Maybe it is .... Or maybe not!</TE>
<TE>   I have the highest regard for psychotherapy. I'd be dead without
it. I also like Greek and Roman myths, in part because they point up,
with a startling lack of sentiment, just how complex--both hideous
and joyful, malign and cherishable--human experience really is. Now
Freud, it's true, was a fairly bleak fellow; it's not so strange that
he would make the terrible legend of Oedipus into the foundational
story of psychoanalysis. Freud had a tragic view of life. (With good
reason: Though he didn't live to see it, four of his five elderly
sisters died, like Anne Frank did, in Nazi concentration camps.)
Undoubtedly he underemphasized the comic side of things and the fact
that in spite of grief, misfortune, sickness and death, some lucky
people figure out a way of whistling in the dark. But Gilligan thinks
she can do better than Freud simply by giving us a cheery new
"emotional script." If we can just let go of whatever "tragic" myth
is holding us in its sway (Oedipus, Patriarchy, Original Sin, Global
Warming, the Curse of the Bambino) and start grooving with Cupid and
Psyche, the darkness will start to lift.</TE>
<TE>   Yet if classic myths teach us anything, it is that you can't just
pick out one you like and ignore the rest. It's a package deal: You
take one Greek god or goddess, you've got to take them all: lustful
Zeus, wise Athena, drunken Dionysus, frigid Diana, fruitful Ceres,
angry Mars, even ghastly Kronos devouring his children. Each one of
these disparate symbolic figments represents a different aspect of
the extraordinarily fluid human psyche and, depending on moral luck
and circumstance, any one of us can turn into any one of them at any
time. (In Rwanda and Bosnia, seemingly inoffensive neighbors suddenly
metamorphosed into monstrous assassins.) Oedipus and Psyche live on
in each of us simultaneously, along with all the rest of the crazy
pantheon. It's worth trying to remember this (possibly depressing)
fact, just as it's worth trying to remember that the world we live in
contains both Kauai and Mogadishu, Manila and the Cotswolds, Winnipeg
and Hanoi, Copenhagen and Kabul. Gilligan's pleasant nostrums
notwithstanding, the map of life is not simple, and it's best to plan
accordingly.</TE>

<HD>Slicing Tomatoes and Other Close Encounters</HD>
<DH>LITTLE CASINO , A Novel, By Gilbert Sorrentino, Coffee
House Press: 214 pp., $14.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARMELA CIURARU</AU>
<BD>Carmela Ciuraru is the editor of "Beat Poets" and the
forthcoming "Poems for America."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gilbert Sorrentino's latest novel, "Little Casino," is a series of
imaginative encounters, dialogues and meditations whose concerns
range from sandwich toppings to mortality. In more than 40 brief,
evocatively titled chapters ("The very picture of loneliness," "Lest
it be forgotten," "Mechanics of the dream world"), Sorrentino muses
on the absurd and the profound with dark humor.</LD>
<LD>   The novel's loosely connected episodes (which occur mostly in
early- to mid-20th century Brooklyn) are followed by author
commentaries, in which Sorrentino critiques what he has just written
("reprehensible"); attempts to "work with" the reader to fill in the
blanks ("dear reader, you may add your own remarks or amorous aquatic
memories in, perhaps, the margins"); or simply offers an odd non
sequitur: "George's father filled the huge jar with, let's say, Greek
olives."</LD>
<LD>   Sorrentino has a brilliant imagination and hilarious philosophical
musings. Although steeped in irony, the novel conveys well the inept
romantic encounters of adolescence, as Sorrentino's various
characters fumble through lust and love. One unnamed boy watches two
teenage girls sitting nearby on the beach: "They have small breasts,"
Sorrentino writes, "which he looks at surreptitiously as often as he
can, the little degenerate."</LD>
<TE>   Sorrentino is both clever and delightful. In one section, the
author contemplates the word "chum," which he writes is "no longer in
general use, save for ironic or parodic effect. It functions, that
is, much like the well-made short story." He adds: "Of which we've
read, ah, plenty."</TE>
<TE>   The author concedes that he has "apparently dumped the contents of
some notebook scribblings onto the page and is hoping to pass it off
as 'innovative' literature." Elsewhere he introduces a section by
announcing that "the scene is so banal as to make one weep in
desperation, and yet, what an overwhelming sense of life!"</TE>
<TE>   Through recipes, proofs, theories, jokes and epistolary exchanges,
Sorrentino meditates on, among other things, family, religion, sex
and childhood. If his language is absurd, his ideas are certainly
not. The author states his contention that people are, "for the most
part, utterly absurd," and he reveals human folly throughout. (One
section concerns, in its entirety, a married couple's petty, heated
argument over slicing tomatoes.)</TE>
<TE>   In the hands of a lesser writer, this experimental novel might
have been a pretentious mess. But in "Little Casino," Sorrentino--an
unsung hero in contemporary literature--displays his intelligence,
exuberance and wisdom, making his novel both entertaining and
incisive.</TE>

<LD>THE COMPLETE POETRY OF CATULLUS</LD>
<LD>   Translated from the Latin by David Mulroy</LD>
<LD>   University of Wisconsin Press: 170 pp., $15.95 paper</LD>
<TE>   The voice of the ancient Roman poet, Catullus, like Sappho's,
sounds contemporary. This new translation by David Mulroy is almost
too contemporary. A back-jacket quote sets Catullus up as "a wild
young poet in Julius Caesar's Rome." His life, we are told, "was akin
to pulp fiction." Beyond this hyperbolic swagger (like Catullus on
steroids), there's certainly truth to the claims of anarchical
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Catullus was a cocky, brilliant wiseguy who had affairs with
married women (including wives of government officials) and wrote
freely about his dalliances. He was not above insulting pompous
political types (what a fresh breeze!), making sport of Caesar
himself. He mocked the back-alley buggery and sexual conquests of his
friends. But he also had a complex, powerful lyric sense, a sadness
and a grandeur. The woman he loved (and whom he addresses in a
deferential, sometimes disturbing manner) was his "Lesbia" (probably
a woman named Clodia Mettelli, a forceful and extremely notorious
individual).</TE>
<TE>   Mulroy's "notes" and contextualization of the work are persuasive,
tonic and conscientious, but his translations suffer. A famous poem
of Catullus to Lesbia about the death of her pet sparrow is a
literal, clunky translation, making light of the bird's death when,
in fact, the poem's subject is grief itself and the provocative
relationship between Catullus and his lover. Other translators (like
Peter Whigham, for example) have rendered the poem in staccato
flashes, beginning with "Who loves beauty / veil her statues... "
Compare this to "Commence lamentation, Venuses, Cupids... " in
Mulroy's opening. Granted, this particular translation-cum-notes
seems directed to students of Latin--but scholar-initiates, like
young poets, can only benefit from understanding the complexities of
the attitudes and language of a poet read and deeply admired a
thousand years after his death.</TE>

<TE>   V:WAVESON.NETS / LOSING L'UNA</TE>
<TE>   By Stephanie Strickland</TE>
<TE>   Penguin: 128 pp., $18 paper</TE>
<TE>   The hypertext poet Stephanie Strickland has a new book of poems
that is "invertible," thus providing two "beginnings" (and two
completely different covers) to the collection. Here is the
publisher's description: "At the book's opened center, where 'Losing
L'Una' turns over into 'WaveSon.nets' and vice-versa, there will be a
pointer (www.Vniverse.com) to the book's third section, which will go
up on the Web when the book comes out."</TE>
<TE>   For the unexceptional poet, the term "hypertext" can be a synonym
for self-indulgent composition, no editing and (in a certain type of
discourse) a naif's appropriation of the "languages" of science and
math--as if the acquisition of technical vocabularies and concepts
were a simple matter of Bachelardian poetic "reverie." Not so in
Strickland's case. This book reminds me a little of Susan Wheeler's
"Source Codes," a book whose "experiments" also include a pastiche of
"high" and "low" diction, text disruption and the play of external
analogs. Strickland, like Wheeler, has a sassy, funny mimic's
sense--but also a steely sense of grammar and structure--traditional
forms are included, inverted, abstracted, sent up--but attended to.</TE>
<TE>   In "V:WaveSon.nets/Losing L'Una" (either book), there are sonnet,
haiku and aphoristic echoes. Strickland's "muse," Simone Weil, is
invoked throughout and the elegiac feel of these poems is haunting
and passionate, inspiring the reader to listen to the "waveforms" of
the human voice. They read like the one long episodic dream of a
being who exists between atmospheres, like a mermaid: From
"WaveSon.nets 2": "If you understand red, you understand ruby, / you
understand light bubbling up struck seam / first morning cliff; you
do not / mock the real / as you watch it subside and divide and then
run / like morning into the virtual."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SELECTED POEMS</TE>
<TE>   By Mona Van Duyn</TE>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf: 224 pp., $27.50</TE>
<TE>   Mona Van Duyn's four decades of poems unfold here in impressive
array--managing to be both accessible and profound. Her first book,
"Valentines to the Wide World," was published in 1959, announcing the
arrival of a poet-virtuoso, whose preferred style leaned to the
modest but mildly coercive: "Beauty is merciless and intemperate. /
Who, turning this way and that, by day, by night, / still stands in
the heart-felt storm of its benefit ... / ... And never will temper
it, / but against that rage slowly may learn to pit / love and art,
which are compassionate."</TE>
<TE>   From this to the minimalist sonnets of "Firefall," her latest
book--"Line fourteen / Closes / to serene / supposes." --is a
continent of metaphysical, formal eloquence. The reader entering this
body of distinguished work will not be disappointed. The oeuvre of
this former U.S. poet laureate generates, even in its ironic moments,
joy.</TE>

<HD>Daddy Dearest</HD>
<DH>MR. POTTER, A Novel, By Jamaica Kincaid, Farrar, Straus &amp;
Giroux: 196 pp., $20</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jamaica Kincaid takes on a difficult task in her new novel, "Mr.
Potter." The narrator tries to describe a man she hardly knows--her
father. Roderick Potter is a taxi driver on Kincaid's native island
of Antigua in the Caribbean. His outer life is uneventful, and his
inner life ... well, because he can't read or write and because the
cruelties of history (the island's and his own) have brutalized and
numbed him, he has almost no inner life.</LD>
<LD>   The narrator, who left Antigua then returned years later to visit
her father's grave, uses her literacy--the words and perspective
Potter lacked--to exhume him, to vent her frustrated love and pent-up
rage. In Kincaid's trademark repetitive style, she hammers at Potter
as if, like a coconut, his shell might split open to reveal sweet
meaning or as if meaning might be conjured up by the simple act of
drumming.</LD>
<LD>   "Can a human being exist in a wilderness," she asks, "a world so
empty of human feeling: love and justice; a world in which love and
even that, justice, only exist from time to time and in small
quantities, or unexpectedly, like a wild seedling of some necessary
or common food...? The answer is yes and yes again and the answer is
no, not really, not so at all."</LD>
<TE>   The narrator is speaking of Potter but also of herself and of
Potter's father, Nathaniel, a descendant of the African slaves
brought to work the sugar cane fields when Antigua was a British
colony. The fields are "stilled now but with their history of horror
unspeakable imprisoned in each stray blade, each stray stalk."
Nathaniel, likewise illiterate, was a fisherman. He had children by
numerous women and refused to support or acknowledge any of them.</TE>
<TE>   Potter has "a line drawn through him, for his father's name did
not appear on his certificate of birth." His impoverished mother
wearies of him and of life. She commits suicide by walking into the
sea. The boy, nicknamed Drickie, is sickly and barely survives on a
diet of scraps and abuse at the home of a schoolmaster. He takes in
"cruelty and ugliness ... silence and indifference ... as if it were
breath itself," and he grows "dull and ugly, in the way of the
forgotten."</TE>
<TE>   A result, the narrator says, balancing pity with condemnation, is
that "the absence in him of fatherly feelings toward his own
children, all of them, became a skin for Mr. Potter, not like a skin,
but a skin itself, a protective covering, something that could not be
lived without."</TE>
<TE>   Potter, lacking the literate person's ability to conceive of his
life as a human story amid many others, isn't aware of how much he
lives by mindless imitation. He becomes a taxi driver because the
schoolmaster taught him to drive. He eventually owns three cars
because that's the number owned by his first boss, Mr. Shoub, a
Lebanese refugee. He dresses as the schoolmaster did and, like his
father, he has many unacknowledged children.</TE>
<TE>   Potter's aim is to glide through each day's expected humiliations
with a clean shirt, a shiny taxi and a few stock phrases and songs.
He doesn't identify with Shoub or with Dr. Weizinger, a Czech
psychiatrist who escaped the Holocaust and makes a living on Antigua
as a general practitioner. They could comfort one another, but Potter
sees only their strangeness; they see only his ignorance.</TE>
<TE>   The narrator, too, has a line drawn through the space where her
father's name should be. Her mother becomes one of the bitter former
lovers who badger Potter in vain for money to buy school supplies for
their children. This is territory Kincaid has explored before, in
novels that include "My Brother" and "The Autobiography of My
Mother": lovelessness between people bound by blood.</TE>
<TE>   Though her writing is full of feeling, Kincaid isn't a
sentimentalist. Try as the narrator will, Potter's life yields little
in the way of a story. The only drama lies in what she, the first
literate member of the family, is able to make of it. And in that
story, anger--"Should I have gone beyond mere wishing and walked over
to him and grabbed him by the throat and squeezed him by the neck
until his body lay limp at my feet?"--is at least as important as
love.</TE>

<DH>THE AUTHOR OF HIMSELF: The Life of Marcel Reich-Ranicki, By
Marcel Reich-Ranicki, Translated from the German by Ewald Osers,
Princeton University Press: 404 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Jacob Heilbrunn is an editorial writer for The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Marcel Reich-Ranicki's "The Author of Himself" appeared in
Germany in 1999, it was an overnight sensation. In a country where
literature still occupies canonic status, Reich-Ranicki had already
earned fame for his encyclopedic grasp of European literature and
fiercely intelligent essays. No one, from Heinrich Boll to Gunter
Grass, completely escaped his wrath. Perhaps Reich-Ranicki's most
notorious act was appearing on the cover of the influential weekly
Der Spiegel in 1995 literally tearing in half the latest Grass novel.</LD>
<LD>   Reich-Ranicki's "The Author of Himself" reveals a different side.
Written in a deceptively simple and beautifully wrought German and
ably translated, it is one of the most poignant and important memoirs
of the last century. Reich-Ranicki recounts his improbable odyssey
from Polish Holocaust survivor to Germany's preeminent literary
critic. Throughout, he shows how literature served as his passport
from tyranny.</LD>
<TE>   Reich-Ranicki was born in Poland in 1920. His mother, who revered
German culture, sent him to live with prosperous relatives in Berlin,
where, at age 9, he attended a Prussian Gymnasium. By his teens, he
had become an avid theater-goer and a devourer of libraries, to
borrow Henry James' phrase, working through Heinrich Heine, Schiller,
Thomas Mann and Georg Buchner, among others. Reich-Ranicki vividly
evokes the Nazis' progressive strangling of cultural life in Berlin.
In October 1938, he was deported to Poland but carried along his
"invisible luggage": German literature.</TE>
<TE>   Reich-Ranicki's account of life in the Warsaw ghetto makes for
almost unbearable reading. One lifeline was music: "You had better
believe it: in the Warsaw ghetto Mozart was never more beautiful."
But the horror was inescapable. Reich-Ranicki, who saw his parents
being deported to Auschwitz, worked as a translator and clerk in the
Judenrat, or Jewish Council, that administered the ghetto.
Reich-Ranicki's reconstruction of the scene of a meeting with
Sturmbannfuhrer Hermann Hofle on July 22, 1942, that announced the
deportation of the ghetto is unforgettable; while Reich-Ranicki's
typewriter clacked away taking down the order, SS troops lounged
outside playing Strauss waltzes on a portable gramophone.</TE>
<TE>   With his wife, Tosia, Reich-Ranicki managed a daring escape.
Outside the ghetto, they found refuge in the cellar of a typesetter
named Bolek. Reich-Ranicki and his wife rolled black-market
cigarettes, and Reich-Ranicki told his hosts stories that he recalled
from his reading. Once the Red Army occupied Poland, Reich-Ranicki
became a Communist Party member and intelligence officer. But as
anti-Semitic purges swept across Eastern Europe, Reich-Ranicki was
kicked out of the party and imprisoned. It was another kind of
liberation for him: In jail he began reading literature again. Upon
release, he began working as a translator and met numerous writers
from both East and West Germany. In 1958, he and Tosia fled from
Poland to Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Reich-Ranicki did not earn fame overnight. He intimates that
lingering anti-Semitism may have impeded his rise. But Reich-Ranicki
could not be stopped. He made it his business to read everything and
meet everyone. His accounts of his meetings with everyone from Elias
Canetti to the Mann family form an essential document of postwar
European literature. Perhaps it is because with his stupendous
knowledge of novels, poetry and plays, Reich-Ranicki represents the
last bit of continuity with the great prewar German humanistic
traditions that were destroyed in World War II. The master of
masterworks has now produced his own.</TE>
<TE>   It is no accident that Reich-Ranicki, who discusses the gradual
erosion of taboos about Nazism in his memoir, is himself the target
of a viciously anti-Semitic work by the distinguished novelist Martin
Walser, called "Death of a Critic." Walser, who has been issuing
broadsides for the restoration of German pride, portrays
Reich-Ranicki as an eternal Jew who cannot be killed. In short order,
Reich-Ranicki has become a lightning rod for disputes about the
meaning of the past, disputes that are linked to the wider debate in
Germany, and throughout Europe, about the return of the far right. It
is not a situation that can please him very much. But Reich-Ranicki
is the quintessential outsider, and few lives reveal as much about
the past century and where the new one may be headed.</TE>

<HD>The Critic's Credo</HD>
<DH>REVIEWERY, By Christopher Ricks, Handsel Books: 386 pp.,
$30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY LESSER</AU>
<BD>Wendy Lesser is the author, most recently, of "Nothing
Remains the Same: Rereading and Remembering." She edits the
Threepenny Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Disinterestedness is certainly an ideal in book reviewing, if by
disinterest we mean not the absence of interest, not even the lack of
a personal stake, but the scrupulous avoidance of ax-grinding,
hobby-horse-riding, character assassination, self-aggrandizement and
all the other things we have come to associate with a badly done
review. The poet Louise Gluck has defined disinterestedness as
"reading as though one had no personality," which I can't imagine
ever being able to do--but in the same place she also remarks, "The
essay that means to defend disinterestedness by claiming it exists
will be both very short and very weak; even the essay on perfect
goodness would be longer."</LD>
<TE>   In pursuit of this unattainable ideal of disinterestedness, a
reviewer might begin by declaring her interests so that other readers
would be able to calculate around them. Let me say, then, that out of
the 37 years represented in Christopher Ricks' "Reviewery," I have
known him for 30. But that's the least of it. No other teacher, no
other model--and he has been both, for me--has had more influence on
my idea of what a critic's role is, or should be. This is not to say
that we think exactly alike. Ricks' tastes in literature are deeper
and narrower and stronger and more original than mine. Regarding
movies, I agree with him about the virtues of Frederick Wiseman but
disagree with him about much else. And as for Bob Dylan, who recurs
in these pages whenever you least expect him, I share the passion
though not the degree of it. (Does anyone share the degree of it?)
Still, the sensibility that gave rise to these reviews is the one
that shaped me as a reviewer. All of which goes to say that you are
better off reading "Reviewery" than reading my review of it, and
that's as it should be, with any worthy book.</TE>
<TE>   The collection is arranged in nonchronological order, but by
careful reading of the footnotes, I discovered that the earliest
piece, on Sartre's "Saint Genet," appeared in January 1964. Time,
however, is surprisingly unimportant here. The reviews have not, to
my ear, dated; no doubt the author has winnowed out the unfit, but
few of us would be able to come up with this many survivors. They
have been sorted into five groups: "Lives," "Arguments," "Critics,"
"Novelists and Poets" and "Other Arts" (a category that ranges from
Stanley Kubrick to Saul Steinberg, from Robert Capa to the Beatles).
And there are gems in every category. It's a pleasure to see what
Ricks had to say about Ian McEwan's "The Comfort of Strangers" and
Norman Mailer's "The Executioner's Song" when they first came out (he
admired both enormously); it's equally enjoyable watching him soundly
thwack Leslie Fiedler, Norman Podhoretz and Stanley Fish. There are
no lukewarm opinions here, no shilly-shallyings between possible
perspectives: Ricks knows how he feels, and he makes his allegiances
evident. They come through clearly, for example, in the loving review
of William Empson's posthumous "Using Biography." "Empson's own
magnanimity is his element; the magnanimity of others is often his
subject," the review points out, and because the preceding 160 pages
have exposed the all-too-frequently self-serving strategies of other
biographers and critics, we know exactly how much Ricks values that
particular quality of Empson's.</TE>
<TE>   What, I asked myself, is Ricks' "element"? The first word that
came to mind was "fairness," but I soon found it being augmented by
other words such as "loyalty" and "passion," with the result that it
ended up some distance from our garden-variety sense of
evenhandedness. Ricks' fairness is admittedly partisan: He has
well-chosen favorites, such as Brian Moore, Erving Goffman and Samuel
Beckett, whose work always earns his praise. But what he is really
working against, when he applauds or practices fairness, is not
partisanship but cheating. And what he means by cheating is not
exactly lying (good novelists and poets sometimes do that) and not
exactly withholding information (great novelists and poets always do
that), but the withholding of potentially damaging information so as
to better one's own position, one's own career, one's own stock in
the literary or artistic or intellectual world.</TE>
<TE>   He is duly critical, for instance, of Stanley Milgram's famous
investigations into how easily people submit to
authority--experiments in which the subjects, thinking they were
acting upon others, were themselves being tricked by their tester. Of
Milgram's resulting book, Ricks comments: " 'Obedience to Authority'
refuses to acknowledge the dilemma inherent in its own obedience to
authority, in this case the authority of experimental psychology as a
discipline .... To anyone who is not an experimental psychologist,
there is something morally equivocal--and often unequivocally
immoral--about a discipline built on systematic deception."</TE>
<TE>   And about a biography of Capa he says: "Photography, or at least
such war-photography as Capa's, has a contract with its contemplators
... the war-photograph says, not that this is how it looked, but this
is how it was. It happened. Which is why I, for one, find it
appalling that Richard Whelan can in the end brush aside the question
of whether Capa's most famous photograph, the falling soldier in
Spain, was faked or not."</TE>
<TE>   This acute moral sense is what enables Ricks to observe--alone
among the contemporary reviewers of "A Clockwork Orange"--that "the
real accusation against the film is certainly not that it is too
violent, but that it is not violent enough; more specifically, that
with a cunning selectivity it sets itself to minimize both Alex's
violence and his delight in it."</TE>
<TE>   In focusing on Ricks' never-too-zealous war against cheating, I
may have given short shrift to the qualities that make him delightful
as a reviewer. There is, first of all, his piercing wit, which he
brings to bear even in describing others' lack of wit ("Beckett is
inconceivable without a sense of humor, and Wordsworth inconceivable
with one"); and then, joined to the wit like a Siamese twin, his
ever-alert sense of language. About a book of Cyril Connolly's
private writings, he notes that "the publication of Connolly's
Journals (1928-1937) does not serve him, except right." And reviewing
Peter Ackroyd's life of T.S. Eliot, he comments on the detailed
treatment of the problematic first marriage and then reports: "The
happiness of Eliot's second marriage necessarily looms less large.
Partly this is because loom isn't what happiness does."</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally--very occasionally--this tremendous verbal ability,
this overflowing playfulness with language, threatens to get in the
way of what Ricks is otherwise saying. Perhaps it will seem
ungrateful of me to complain about a characteristic that has brought
me so much joy. But as Ricks himself says in expressing his gratitude
toward Richard Ellman's "James Joyce," "A reviewer will feel some
slight obligation to the higher ingratitude, to remind men that even
the best of books is not perfect." It is in this spirit, then, that I
conclude by looking closely at a marvelous paragraph from the review
of "The Executioner's Song":</TE>
<TE>   "You could call the book a feat of self-abnegation if the word
'feat' didn't suggest a bravura. Gilmore, who had no self-control
once he had decided to throw a switch inside his head and to vent the
pent, but who had gigantic self-control once the imminent death was
not that of another but of himself, is here complemented by an artist
who most unexpectedly shows in this sane and magnanimous book a high
form of self-control: a control over the extent to which, and the
ways in which, self is present at all even to be controlled exactly.
The author of 'Advertisements for Myself' is here advertising
nothing, least of all himself."</TE>
<TE>   Which is all true, and desperately worth saying. My problem is
with that little phrase "to vent the pent," that signature bit of
Ricksian language-love. It's a terrific piece of wordplay, but that
kind of attention-getting gesture is precisely what is not needed in
a paragraph about the virtues of self-effacement. This is a minor
grumble, though, and only goes to show that, like perfect goodness or
perfect disinterestedness, the perfect review is an impossible ideal.
Of all the people I know, Christopher Ricks has come the closest to
achieving it.</TE>

<LD>To the editor:</LD>
<LD>   After reading Richard Schickel's review of my joint biography of
Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune, "The Emperor and the Wolf" (Book
Review, July 14), I have to ask the question: Did he even bother to
read it? The review suggests very strongly that no, he did not.</LD>
<LD>   He criticizes it for not being a more speculative, interpretive
biography, but I point out quite clearly my approach in the book's
introduction. He accuses me of being a "mad fact collector." (I find
this statement singularly peculiar; most readers of biographies, one
would hope, prefer facts to rumor and innuendo.) Schickel, clearly,
isn't much for mad fact collecting himself, for his review
perpetuates myths (and creates a new one) rather than dispels them.</LD>
<TE>   For example, Mifune was not an "aerial cameraman," nor was
Kurosawa, as Schickel absurdly suggests, "something of an
anti-Communist." The former is dispelled by the compelling comments
of Mifune's oldest and closest friend, with whom he served during the
war. If Schickel had even bothered to read the photo captions, he
might have learned that. For the latter, Kurosawa was, as they say, a
card-carrying member of the Communist Party in his youth, and was
later employed by the Soviet government to direct the Oscar-winning
"Dersu Uzala" (1975).</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, there are factual errors throughout the review: "The
samurai Mifune played for [Kurosawa] were all ronin" (not in "Throne
of Blood" and "The Hidden Fortress"); "Mifune worked in middle-class
garb ... [in] 'High and Low' and 'The Bad Sleep Well' " (no, those
were set in a world of ostentatious wealth).</TE>
<TE>   Had my book been an umpteenth monograph of Hitchcock or Ford, one
might excuse Schickel's pettiness. But this is the first
English-language biography of either man (not counting Kurosawa's
autobiography, which discusses only his early years and first films).
I'd estimate 70% of its content is information never before published
in English, including dozens of interviews with collaborators done
specifically for this book. Schickel makes broad, sweeping claims
about my book, such as "[Galbraith] shovels useless information in
lieu of thoughtful insight." Yet, how insightful is criticism when
it's unsupported by evidence and examples, buttressed by a lazy essay
rife with errors?</TE>
<TE>   I don't pretend the work to be perfect and would indeed welcome
useful criticism. However, surely a more professional review is
called for--one that, hopefully, acknowledges its attributes (and I'm
quite confident that it has many) as well as its shortcomings. This
surely, would have been preferable to misinformed petulance.</TE>
<TE>   Stuart Galbraith IV</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Richard Schickel replies:</TE>
<TE>   Stuart Galbraith identifies Mifune as "an aerial photographer
during World War II" on page 5 of his book (as well as in a photo
caption). It is true he did not see combat action in that role, but
that was certainly his military job classification. Furthermore, I
employ the words "cameraman" and "photographer" interchangeably and
have no intention of splitting hairs with Galbraith on this point.</TE>
<TE>   I agree with Galbraith about Mifune's roles in "Throne of Blood"
and "The Hidden Fortress." I should have made a finer distinction in
that passage of my review. But he is, I think, grasping at straws
when it comes to "High and Low" and "The Bad Sleep Well." In the
former case Mifune is a man who has risen to some prosperity, but it
is established that if he pays the ransom for the kidnapped boy, it
will ruin him. In other words, his wealth is new and does not run
very deep. In the latter movie, he plays the secretary to an
industrialist; he is the servant of wealth, but not, so far as I can
see, particularly well-to-do himself.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not Kurosawa carried a Communist Party card in his
youth is irrelevant to the fact that his films far transcend the
conventional left-right political continuum and were, of course,
frequently criticized by the left. That he made a movie under Soviet
auspices is really not germane to this point. "Dersu Uzala" is a
historical epic, set in pre-communist Russia, and has nothing to say,
even metaphorically, about modern political issues. Galbraith himself
says that after a five-year hiatus from production Kurosawa was
"desperate" to make a film and obviously did not much care who
financed it. In other words, the director probably remained a leftist
of some sort, but in my interpretation of his work, he either ignores
or implicitly criticizes conventional ideological solutions to life's
problems.</TE>
<TE>   I respect the amount of research that went into "The Emperor and
the Wolf." But the fact remains that Galbraith has done nothing with
it that significantly adds to our understanding of his subjects. It
is, in essence, an endlessly annotated filmography. I admit that my
eyes frequently glazed over as I read it. But read it I did--in
frustration and with growing impatience at its lack of ideas or
insight.</TE>

<HD>The Prophet of an Empire's End</HD>
<DH>THE LONG RECESSIONAL: The Imperial Life of  Rudyard
Kipling, By David Gilmour, Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux:  352 pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT F. MOSS</AU>
<BD>Robert F. Moss is the author of "Rudyard Kipling and
the Fiction of Adolescence."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Mark Twain and Rudyard Kipling both received honorary degrees
from Oxford in 1907, the aptness of the pairing went far beyond their
internationally famous mustaches. Both pioneered the use of the
vernacular, created adolescent adventure stories that have fascinated
the adult world ever since and combined popular success with critical
adulation. Each produced writing of genius and compassion, yet one
figure is blessed by his consistency with contemporary left-liberal
political values and the other damned by the absence of it. Ignored
or derided by critics, banished from university syllabuses, Kipling
suffers from what critic Edward Rothstein calls a "permanently
sullied" reputation.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Bombay in 1865, Kipling had an early life of radical
departures: five years of bliss with his parents, followed by five
years of misery in an English boardinghouse and a similar span at a
public school in Devon, then back to India for a newspaper job in
Lahore. The bombardment of influences, complemented by his artistic
gifts, was bound to produce one of the world's most idiosyncratic
literary personalities.</LD>
<TE>   At 16, Kipling was squinting through his plate-glass spectacles at
soldiers and civil servants of the Empire, mingling freely with
Indians and recording all the voices in his head; at 22, he had
published "Departmental Ditties" and "Plain Tales From the Hills" and
essentially invented what came to be known as Anglo-Indian
literature, a subgenre that includes works by E.M. Forster, W.
Somerset Maugham, Paul Scott, J.R. Ackerley and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala.</TE>
<TE>   Moving on to London and later to Brattleboro, Vt., he triumphed
again with "Barrack-Room Ballads," melodious Cockney poems with
Sousa-like rhythms that made him the "soldier's poet," and both
volumes of "The Jungle Book," a rich fable re-imagining his own
culturally divided boyhood. Critics enthused; James, Hardy and
Tennyson were all impressed and Conrad was jealous. When at age 41
Kipling won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1907, he was--and still
is--the youngest recipient ever as well as the first English winner.
As if this weren't enough, he had a flawless ear and is the most
prolific English phrasemaker since Pope, possibly even since
Shakespeare.</TE>
<TE>   None of this, however, could prevent the erosion of his critical
stature that started after 1902, the result in large measure to his
rabidly Tory politics but also of his increasing remoteness from
modernist aesthetics, both as a poet and as a fiction writer. And
yet, in some quarters, scholarly interest in the "bard of Empire"
persists. Of the 50-plus books written about him since 1900, at least
nine appeared in the last dozen years, and already we have another,
"The Long Recessional" by David Gilmour, a versatile Scottish
historian whose previous subjects include Giuseppe di Lampedusa and
Lord Curzon.</TE>
<TE>   Gilmour describes his book as "the first volume to chronicle
Kipling's political life," aligning it with the rise and decline of
the Empire which Kipling had come to epitomize. Of his many
predecessors, Gilmour asserts, "Most of their work has concentrated
on the prose ... a little on the poetry, and virtually none" on
Kipling's "public role."</TE>
<TE>   This overstates the case. Recent works by Harry Ricketts ("The
Unforgiving Minute: A Life of Rudyard Kipling") and Andrew Lycett
("Rudyard Kipling") quite adequately acquaint the reader with
Kipling's numerous polemical poems, topical parables, editorials
disguised as short stories and pro-imperialist or war-related public
activities. Nor does either biographer slight Kipling's nonpolitical
ballads and resonant hymns.</TE>
<TE>   As promised, Gilmour examines Kipling's work methodically,
promoting his master theme that imperialism and conservatism were the
seedbed of the poet's imagination, that "his politics could not be
disentangled from his work." Unfortunately, Gilmour's readings,
although sensible, are fairly pedestrian. His conclusions about "The
Man Who Would Be King" ("a parable of Empire"), "The Ballad of East
and West" ("two men of similar courage and ability ... can be equals"
despite racial differences) and "The Jungle Book" ("the wolf pack is
strong ... so long as it retains ... obedience to the Law") add
little to received wisdom on these works.</TE>
<TE>   But if Gilmour does not excel as a textual analyst, he is superb
as a historian and biographer. His research encompasses 55 manuscript
collections, dozens of books and articles on Kipling, histories of
the Raj, memoirs of all the key players in Kipling's life and,
seemingly, every word his subject ever wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Although Kipling is whisked rather perfunctorily through his first
16 years, once Gilmour gets him back to India and his position on the
Civil and Military Gazette, the narrative glistens with color. For
the teenage journalist, mornings began with his fox terrier "waking
him to share ... breakfast and the inside of the day's post," quickly
gave way to sweltering 10-hour days as "50 percent of the editorial
staff" of the Gazette and were often succeeded by nights in "opium
dens and gambling haunts" or "strolling with Indians or listening to
the 'long yarns' they spun in ... their homes." No wonder Kipling
declared in his poem "The Two-Sided Man" that "Allah ... gave me two
/ Separate sides of my head."</TE>
<TE>   The scenes in London, where Kipling achieves literary glory while
residing in "a centre of music-halls, prostitution and crime" and
where the editor W.E. Henley is so elated by the poem "Danny Deever"
that he dances on his wooden leg, are uniformly vivid. Once Kipling
is married and living in Vermont, which had been little more than a
stop in the United States during his honeymoon, Gilmour's interest
seems to flag, but after the bard is comfortably resettled in Sussex
for the rest of his life, a literary man doubling as a country
squire, the writing regains its vigor. We encounter him "crouched at
his desk or pacing up and down the room"; later, clad in "Trilby or
shabby cap," he "slashed at nettles and other weeds" and "fished for
trout in his unpredictable river."</TE>
<TE>   The great "apologist" for British colonialism, Kipling is too
often championed by people who become apologists for him. Not so
Gilmour, who meticulously exposes his subject's anti-Semitism and
belief in Anglo-Saxon superiority, along with his conviction that
England's subject peoples were all "like children" and incapable of
self-government. A man of limitless antipathies, he volleyed and
thundered against the Indian National Congress, Irish Home Rule, Free
Trade, free verse, Lloyd George, Woodrow Wilson, Winston Churchill
and every Liberal (or liberal) on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Gilmour is so scrupulously impartial, he has earned our full
confidence when he turns to Kipling's defense. Some of his arguments,
while valid, have become the boilerplate of Kipling reappraisals:
that Kipling is redeemed by the love of India (a "rich frieze of
varied and happy life") he reveals in "Kim" and his other best work;
that, for him, imperialism was only justified by a spirit of duty and
self-sacrifice, that he deplored the behavior of "white men"
governing "races whose cherished customs they outrage."</TE>
<TE>   Kipling's imperial ideals, however politically unfashionable, were
not hypocritical or fanciful. Gilmour documents the historical
reality of an Indian Civil Service that provided Hindus and Muslims
alike with "peace and justice, quinine and canals, railways and
vaccinations." But these passages would be more compelling if Kipling
(or Gilmour, for that matter) ever acknowledged the economic
apparatus of colonialism--all those cotton, tea and rubber
plantations that enriched the crown.</TE>
<TE>   Like other biographers, Gilmour evokes sympathy for Kipling by
simply reporting his personal tragedies, the loss of his young
daughter Josephine to illness and his son John to the slaughter of
World War I. As memorials, he created literary masterpieces for each,
the tender ghost story "They" and the mystical, post-apocalyptic "The
Gardener." Gilmour also introduces a Kipling previously unknown to
most of us: the outspoken proponent of women's rights. Although he
opposed feminism in England, as a young Anglo-Indian journalist,
Kipling made war on child matrimony, the odious Hindu custom of
marrying off girls of 10 or 11 to old men. He also defended the right
of Indian women to modern medical aid and denounced the prototypical
Brahmin for not being "educated ... up to the level of recognizing
his wife as his equal."</TE>
<TE>   "Prophet of Empire" is another of Kipling's nicknames, and Gilmour
rightly places him in the highest rank of soothsayers. He didn't need
tea leaves or chicken entrails, only his own grim intuitions, to
handicap four wars (the Boer conflict, World Wars I and II and the
Indian-Pakistani bloodbath of 1947), the maelstrom of Nazism and
apartheid.</TE>
<TE>   Gilmour's book was written before the tragedy of Sept. 11. Should
we then ignore relevant parallels in Kipling's work, using his
deplorable prejudices as our excuse? Among his frequent themes are
Islam's warrior traditions, the religious intolerance and despotism
of the East and an appetite for mutilation and other Taliban-like
brutalities. When an Afghan character in "Kim" mutters "God's curse
on all unbelievers," only the language is archaic.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of this short but formidable study, Gilmour leaves
Kipling the prophet on stage rather than Kipling the artist, as we
might have preferred. In his approving citation of another scholar's
epitaph on Kipling--a "dead Classic"--he makes himself sound as
pessimistic as his subject, who, at his death in 1936, despaired of
his country and his civilization. But if, as Gilmour proudly notes,
England has survived, so has Kipling. With more than a hundred books
in print and popular culture continuing to recycle his work, "dead"
isn't the word for Kipling. "Deathless" is more apt.</TE>

<LD>IT'S A FREE COUNTRY: Personal Freedom in America After September 11</LD>
<LD>   Edited by Danny Goldberg, Victor Goldberg and Robert Greenwald</LD>
<LD>   RDV Books/N.Y.: 372 pp., $19.95</LD>
<TE>   "The fundamental fear expressed in this book," writes Cornel West
in the foreword to "It's a Free Country," "is that the present
American obsession with safety may undermine freedom, that security
could trump liberty, that democracy might be lost in the name of
declaring war on terrorism." In the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11,
there was enormous resistance, born of fear, to hearing the concerns
expressed in this volume. The first casualty of war is reason, writes
Ramona Ripston in her essay. A year has passed, and perhaps now these
voices can be heard.</TE>
<TE>   The book's first section on the history of the democracy-security
debate illuminates how fundamental this issue is to the definition of
democracy. Ira Glasser takes us back to Alexander Hamilton, who
worried in 1787 when the Constitution was being framed that to be
"more safe" would involve being "less free." Glasser walks us through
the many points in American history when war has been used as an
opportunity for the expansion of government power: the 1787 Alien and
Sedition Acts, the 1917 Espionage Act, the 1941 internment of
Japanese Americans, McCarthyism in the 1950s, the Patriot Act of
2000; each more embarrassing than the last, each a black spot in
American history, recognized in retrospect (except, of course, for
the most recent one) as an infringement on democracy.</TE>
<TE>   The book is most useful when it is most specific; many of the
essays are repetitive grandstanding. Some write that the threats to
our civil liberties are exaggerated, others that the threat to our
security has been exaggerated. Relief from the feeling of immediate
danger comes in the form of rare satire, like Michael Moore's letters
to President Bush, or in the cartoons of Matt Groening and the poetry
of Ani DiFranco.</TE>

<TE>   TOTAL FEARS</TE>
<TE>   By Bohumil Hrabal</TE>
<TE>   Translated from the Czech</TE>
<TE>   by James Naughton</TE>
<TE>   Twisted Spoon Press/Prague:</TE>
<TE>   206 pp., $13.50</TE>
<TE>   These essays, in the form of letters to an American student, April
Gifford, nicknamed Dubenka, are Bohumil Hrabal at his most ecstatic,
in the sense of almost religious fervor, full of the "mystic vision"
of Eastern European writers. They are his dark night of the soul, his
"Wasteland." Written from 1989 to 1992 (when Hrabal was 75), they are
the sum of his fear and his shame. Fear born in utero when his
grandfather pretended to shoot Hrabal's pregnant mother just to teach
her a lesson; fear that lasted through his life of many revolutions,
uprisings and his own persecution by Nazis and the secret police
during Alexander Dubcek's government. Shame at being a writer; shame
for being afraid and playing along with the secret police; shame at
being enthralled with the "Delighted States" when his country was in
upheaval in 1968 and again in the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by a Danish journalist why he never emigrated, Hrabal, who
died in 1997, replies, "I emigrated inwardly ... to the pub." These
are terribly intimate letters, in which he described the many
"invisible threads" drawing him toward death and binding him to the
already dead: his wife, Kafka, T.S. Eliot, even Shakespeare. He
writes from his house in Kersko, where he lives with his cats. He
sees the demonstrations in Prague on TV: "I'm sniffling--I see it,
this beauty of Prague, these lovely girls, these young men, students,
stepping out all proud and solemn about how fate is not passing them
by, but moving with them and through them."</TE>

<TE>   TOOTHPICKS &amp; LOGOS</TE>
<TE>   Design in Everyday Life</TE>
<TE>   By John Heskett</TE>
<TE>   Oxford University Press:</TE>
<TE>   214 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   Books on design are often difficult to read, the general rule
being that the simpler the concepts, the greater the jargon. John
Heskett avoids this, mercifully, for he is covering a wide territory:
changes in the modernist dictum, "form follows function," the effects
of mass manufacturing on design, global design as the embodiment of
cultural values, the effects of technology on design and the role of
designers.</TE>
<TE>   Heskett's examples are particularly delightful. Take, for
instance, the mass-produced Japanese toothpick, beveled at one end so
that it can be broken easily; the used end sits on top of the broken
piece so that it does not touch the table, embodying Japanese values
of cleanliness and aesthetics of the table.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Heskett saves one of the greatest design gaffes of all
time for last, an effective argument for designers that act as more
than technocrats: the 2000 U.S. presidential ballot.</TE>

<DH>DIG INFINITY!: The Life and Art of  Lord Buckley, By Oliver
Trager, Welcome Rain: 406 pp., $30 (including CD)</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GROVER SALES</AU>
<BD>Grover Sales is the author of "Jazz: America's
Classical Music" and teaches jazz studies at Stanford University. In
the early 1960s he handled publicity for Lord Buckley in the San
Francisco Bay area.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The welcome full-scale biography of Lord Buckley may signal the
long-overdue revival of this avant-garde stand-up, nonstop
jazz-talking ecstatic visionary preacher with a three-octave range
and febrile surrealist imagination who loomed decades ahead of his
time. His death in 1960 was largely overlooked by the standard obits,
except as an opportunity to dismiss him as a "cult comic."</LD>
<LD>   Those obits neglected to add that the ever-growing "cult" quoted
at length in Oliver Trager's exhaustive tribute, "Dig Infinity!,"
included Steve Allen, Ed Sullivan, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie,
Robin Williams, Ken Kesey, Henry Miller, the Grateful Dead, the
Beatles, Studs Terkel, Jonathan Winters, Frank Sinatra, Laurence
Olivier, Frank Zappa, Dick Gregory and the Nicholas Brothers. Not to
forget an early employer, Al Capone, reputed to have called Buckley
"the only man that ever made me laugh."</LD>
<TE>   Those familiar with Lord Richard Buckley only on recordings tended
to assume he was black and were aghast to discover that, in the
flesh, he embodied the Hollywood stereotype of a crusty British Lord,
what Eric Hobsbawm, who writes as a jazz critic under the name of
Francis Newton, described as "a Colonel cashiered from the Indian
army in 1930." His Lordship, a title self-conferred and lived to the
hilt, offstage as much as on, was noted for recasting Shakespeare,
the Bible and the lives of Jesus and Gandhi into the jazz argot of a
black hipster. At 6 feet, 3 inches tall and weighing 185 pounds, his
barrel-chested gymnastic physique reflected an early stint as
lumberjack in the environs of Tuolumne, Calif., in the High Sierra,
where he was born in 1906.</TE>
<TE>   Teaming up with Red Skelton as emcee in the walkathons, those
grueling marathons of the Great Depression, Buckley reinvented his
persona even more radically than Jay Gatsby did. A charismatic con
man and bunco artist, he lived the flamboyant epicurean lifestyle of
an oil-rich potentate, conferring honorific titles on his "royal
court" of idolaters ("Lady Doris, Prince Valentine") eager to lavish
him with free rent, motorcars and unlimited credit. Tubby Boots, who
joined the Buckley Royal Court at the age of 12, said, "Buckley
should have been born with money because he thought he had money.
He'd go out and tell the butcher, 'My God, I'm having a party in your
honor. Every Hollywood star is going to be there. I know you're going
to want to put the meat in the party.' And before you knew it,
Buckley had all the trimmings for a party. He was always in debt, but
people loved him because he only took advantage of his friends. If he
liked you, he'd con you. If he didn't like you, he avoided you."</TE>
<TE>   His road manager, Charles Tacot, recalled: "Buckley led sixteen
nude people through the lobby of the Royal Hawaiian where [Frank]
Sinatra was performing. Sinatra had got him the job. When he learned
of this caper he phoned Buckley. 'It's the funniest thing I ever
heard. Just don't ask me for any more favors.' "</TE>
<TE>   Trager also quotes the late comic Adam Keefe: "Buckley was working
in a Chicago club, the Suzy Q. He hired an open-backed hearse and was
lying in an open coffin in the back of the hearse. There was a big
sign that said, 'The Body Comes Alive at the Suzy Q' and he's lying
there in the coffin smoking a joint riding around Chicago."</TE>
<TE>   Buckley carefully tailored his act to fit the audience. His
frequent gigs on "The Ed Sullivan Show" stuck to safer material,
including his audience participation Amos 'n Andy ventriloquist
routine and the phantasmagoric sounds of a Fourth of July picnic
replete with brass band and double-talk political speechifying.
Working a hipper crowd, like the one at the Coffee Gallery in San
Francisco's North Beach during the heyday of the beatnik invasion of
the 1950s, Buckley openly smoked pot on stage while he regaled the
societal dropouts with "The Nazz," shorthand for "The Nazarene": "So
The Nazz and his buddies was goofin' off down the boulevard one day
and they run into a little cat with a bent frame. So The Nazz say,
'What's de mattawid you baby?' And the little cat say, 'My frame is
bent, Nazz--it's been bent from in front.'</TE>
<TE>   "So The Nazz put the golden eyes of love on this little kitty and
he looked right down into the window of the little cat's soul! And he
say, STRAIGHT-EN!!! Ka-zoom! Up went the cat like an arrow and
ever-body jumpin' up and down say, 'Would you look what The Nazz put
on that boy! You dug Him before--re-dig Him now!' "</TE>
<TE>   Half a century ago, you might have had only a hazy notion of what
he was talking about, unless you were a new wave comic, actor, writer
or a jazz musician like his protege, Anita O' Day, who considered him
"the forefather of Professor Irwin Corey, Lenny Bruce, Mike Nichols
and Elaine May."</TE>
<TE>   Actor-comic Larry Storch "never saw him write anything down. He
was able to pick four people out of an audience and do a routine with
them, but it would take him fifteen minutes--it was absolutely
hypnotic: 'You! Up on stage immediately! You don't want to make me
angry!' And by God, they would go right up on stage. I saw old people
with canes hobble up on stage. And he'd sit them on stools in front
of him, and tap each one on the back and tell them to move their lips
and suddenly here 'vas un olt Chewish man' and Buckley would tap
someone else and they'd move their lips and out would come Louis
Armstrong's voice, and it was absolutely hysterical."</TE>
<TE>   The public notoriety that evaded Buckley in life surfaced
immediately after his death in 1960 at 54, when the Manhattan media
led by the Village Voice discovered that he was another victim of the
New York Police's notorious "cabaret card" law, which prevented
anyone convicted of a felony, no matter how remote or trivial, from
being employed in a venue that served alcohol. (Buckley had been
charged with a minor misdemeanor 15 years earlier.) His death set
loose a firestorm of organized protest among theatrical unions, show
people and journalists, including Nat Hentoff, that resulted in the
abolition of the "cabaret card" insanity.</TE>
<TE>   Comic and political activist Dick Gregory provides a clue to the
possible reasons behind a revival of interest today in Buckley's
recordings and appearances on "The Ed Sullivan Show" and Groucho
Marx's "You Bet Your Life": "His use of the African American idiom
was brilliant. It wouldn't take nothing to do that now, but imagine
the guts and integrity it took for him to do that in his time.
Political Correctness notwithstanding, I think his material would go
over big now because America, despite its many problems, is more
mature than it was then."</TE>
<TE>   Trager's obvious labor of obsessive passion covers Buckley's
obscure origins, with expansive interviews with nearly everyone who
had contact with His Lordship, including his beauteous, supportive
and infinitely patient wife, "Lady" Elizabeth Buckley. The CD
included with Trager's book contains some of his most memorable live
routines to suggest why Buckley was embraced with messianic fervor by
leading writers, comics, actors and opinion makers of our time, many
of whom can still recite "The Nazz," "The Bad-Rapping of the Marquis
De Sade" and "Willie the Shake" from memory. Perhaps His Lordship's
time has finally come.</TE>

<DH>THE RUSSIAN DEBUTANTE'S HANDBOOK , A Novel, By Gary
Shteyngart, Riverhead Books: 454 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN SCHIFRIN</AU>
<BD>Daniel Schifrin is a columnist for New York Jewish
Week.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two prominent themes in 20th century American literature are the
immigrant experience and the all-consuming need to make--or keep--a
buck. Gary Shteyngart, in his energetic, sparkling, often hysterical
first novel, "The Russian Debutante's Handbook," turns those themes
on their head as he tells the story of a 25-year-old Russian Jewish
immigrant, Vladimir Girshkin, who is neither properly assimilated nor
able to leverage the advantages of the American Dream as his parents
have done. Vladimir dreams of becoming an "alpha immigrant" like his
mother, a successful hedge-fund manager. Instead, he works for an
hourly wage at Manhattan's Emma Lazarus Immigrant Absorption Society,
remaining "the immigrant's immigrant, the expatriate's expatriate,
enduring victim of every practical joke the late twentieth century
had to offer."</LD>
<LD>   Expensively educated and extensively pampered by his family,
Vladimir falls in love with a scion of New York's Italian American
community, Francesca Ruocco, and quickly blows several thousand
dollars trying to impress her. The resonant details of his entrance
into her party circuit--"Eyebrow waxing fees, aged balsamic vinegar
for the Ruoccos, bottles of Calvados brought to parties:
$275.00"--recall the inspired stupor of "Bright Lights, Big City" and
the absurd rituals and social jealousies of "The Bonfire of the
Vanities."</LD>
<TE>   Vladimir's attempts to recoup his losses lead him, in a dazzling
comic set piece, into the clutches of the Catalan mobsters. He tries
to escape, only to find himself back in Eastern Europe, where a
former immigration client introduces him to his son, a Ukrainian thug
nicknamed the Groundhog. Realizing that he has to pull his weight or
be pursued by two crime networks, Vladimir rolls up his sleeves and
creates a (temporarily) successful pyramid scheme in the Prague-like
city of Prava.</TE>
<TE>   The fantastical transformation of a soft-chested, Oberlin-educated
young man into a Mafioso furthers Shteyngart's idea of how fantasies
of America create their own reality. Apparently it's enough for
Vladimir to dress his gun-toting colleagues in Perry Ellis
windbreakers in order to be proclaimed a business genius.
Unfortunately, this insight isn't sufficient to sustain the narrative
thrust of the book's second act, as the churning drama of New York
devolves into the petty anxieties of rich Yankee expats.</TE>
<TE>   Vladimir's attempt to outwit his Mafia handlers, despite the
homage to a tradition of Russian literary absurdism, begins to
resemble a Hollywood movie, complete with explosions, car wrecks and
improbable coincidences. While Shteyngart's descriptive and ironic
language, comic sense and eye for detail are still very much in
evidence in the European section, the story seems to lose its
moorings once pulled out of American soil.</TE>
<TE>   It is perhaps one lesson of the impressive but imperfect "The
Russian Debutante's Handbook" that the American Dream--as well as the
telling of it--can't quite make it in the Old Country.</TE>

<HD>The Iceman Cometh</HD>
<DH>ICELAND: A Novel, By Jim Krusoe, Dalkey Archive: 182 pp.,
$14.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF TURRENTINE</AU>
<BD>Jeff Turrentine is a senior editor at Hemispheres
magazine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reading "Iceland," Jim Krusoe's slim and surreal first novel, is
rather like watching a gifted, self-assured magician perform a
routine in which the audience's willing-suspension-of-disbelief
threshold is constantly being reset higher and higher. It shouldn't
work. It can't work: Too many ironclad laws of fiction writing are
being casually violated on every page. Then, miraculously, the author
pulls it off, and you're left feeling dazzled, even breathless.</LD>
<LD>   This is literature at its most audacious and imaginative but also
at its most coolly controlled. Krusoe is stylistically daring without
being self-consciously avant-garde; he's laugh-out-loud funny but
never lapses into contrived jokiness. Moreover, "Iceland" manages to
be that rarest of things: a novel of ideas that's unpretentious and
great fun to read. Somewhere up in heaven, Donald Barthelme, Joseph
Heller and John Gardner are looking down and smiling proudly. Here on
Earth, Martin Amis regards "Iceland" as "a work of great originality,
humor, cunning, and charm."</LD>
<TE>   Any attempt to synopsize the almost cartoonishly absurd story line
of "Iceland" is doomed. Here's the old college try, all the same.
Paul, an underemployed and critically ill (or so he believes)
typewriter repairman, is instructed by his doctor to select a new,
unspecified organ from the local organ pool, not a figurative term
for the supply of available organs in a given area at a given time
but an actual swimming pool filled with spleens, kidneys, livers and
other human viscera. Tending the pool is Emily, a beautiful stranger
with whom Paul immediately has a passionate sexual encounter (the
description of which reads like a letter to Penthouse "Forum" drafted
by Andre Breton). Later he misdials her phone number and accidentally
reaches a carpet-cleaning service. A technician pays Paul a couple of
visits, cleans his mysteriously stained carpet and then invites him
on a spur-of-the-moment all-expenses-paid trip to Iceland.</TE>
<TE>   And so the brand-new friends head off together for Reykjavik,
which will become Paul's home for a few years (once he's undergone a
terrifying ordeal in the bowels of an active volcano and yet another
bout of spontaneous vigorous coupling with a sexy stranger). Love,
marriage, birth, disillusionment and death make significant
appearances. Then, in just one of many nods that "Iceland" makes to
the Nietzschean concept of eternal recurrence, Paul finds himself
back in his American hometown of St. Nils, living once again in his
old apartment, free to resume the life he had placed on hold and
determined to reconnect with Emily, whose memory has haunted him ever
since their magic moment at the organ pool.</TE>
<TE>   Krusoe teaches writing at Santa Monica College and Antioch
University and is former editor of the Santa Monica Review. His 1997
book of short stories, "Blood Lake," spent six weeks on the Los
Angeles Times bestseller list. He writes with bravura is rooted in
his supreme confidence. He has little use for the hoary conventions
of traditional narrative exposition, and he's not afraid to compress
or elide the major events in Paul's life if it will get him where he
wants to go that much sooner. (The book is filled with the kinds of
expository humdingers that would get any other writer in big trouble;
my favorite is the paragraph that unapologetically begins: "Then a
few years passed.") Where Krusoe wants to go is inside Paul's head,
to the space where perception, memory and invention, chained
together, are hard at work constructing his reality. It's true that
the outlandish plot of "Iceland," combined with the author's
shaggy-dog-story delivery, makes the novel seem at times like a
complicated, protracted joke, but it's like a joke being told during
the keynote speech of an epistemologists' convention. It's funny, but
if you pay really close attention, it'll mess with your mind.</TE>
<TE>   Every few pages Paul is "suddenly reminded" of the conversation he
had with Emily during the languorous pauses between their poolside
sexual acrobatics. Never mind that, as narrated, their encounter
lasted for only a few minutes and was marked by almost no dialogue:
Paul is nevertheless able to remember Emily intelligently discussing
Zen metaphysics, spinning weird folk tales a la Arthur Schnitzler and
recalling her childhood on a Midwestern farm as the daughter of
germ-obsessed antibiotics addicts. Is he fantasizing? Embellishing?
Krusoe offers no clues. What he does offer is a definition of love as
something much more than sexual chemistry, mutual tenderness or even
shared history. For Paul, love is discourse, and its rose never
blooms more magnificently than in those moments early in a
relationship when you're learning everything there is to know about
your beloved. He recalls Emily's gnomic soliloquies the way a
lovesick soldier might recall the blue eyes, ruby lips and soft hair
of the girl waiting for him back home.</TE>
<TE>   The question of whether Paul's memories are trustworthy or not is
almost beside the point. What matters is the way in which these
memories, real or imagined, animate him and propel him toward his
destiny. Meanwhile, however, there's plenty of evidence to suggest
that the line between the objective world and Paul's subjective
experience of it is breaking down. Magazine articles, carpet stains
and paintings become cryptic signals, pieces of a puzzle that seem to
have something to do with Paul's role in the universe. A mysterious
pair of men keep showing up over and over, always with different
names and different reasons for being there; at one point they bug
his apartment. Anyone familiar with the literature of schizophrenia
might recognize in Paul the seeds of that particular disorder: the
disjointed narrative (complete with temporal collapses, suggesting
fugues), the belief that secret messages are being sent to him via
mass-produced images, the regular appearance of suspicious men
engaging in spy-like activity. Is Paul schizophrenic? Krusoe
certainly invites us to speculate. But ultimately he seems less
interested in answering that question than in studying the ways that
perception and reality are constantly folding into each other in the
Mobius strip of Paul's existence.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down / And they all led
me straight back home to you," goes a line from a Gram Parsons song.
This idea--that the circuitous paths we take in our lives have been
deterministically mapped to place us, finally, at the front door of
the person with whom we're meant to be--has been the bread and butter
of poets, troubadours and other romantics throughout the ages. Paul's
crazy route in life leads him through "Iceland," inside boiling
volcanoes, into the beds of other women, even to a life of crime and
a stint in jail. And when he's done, he thinks he knows--and we think
we know--how his story is supposed to end.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone is surprised. Krusoe may be a magician, but it turns out
he's one of those subversive magicians who delights in exposing the
artifice behind our cherished illusions. In this case, the illusion
he punctures is that each of us is destined to be with someone else,
the mystical "soul mate" of Plato and poetry. In the last pages of
this amazing novel, he paints an almost Sartre-like picture of a man
alone in the universe, connected to no one but himself, belonging
nowhere but inside his own head. Comic surrealism gives way to a
poignant depiction of a hard truth too often lost on troubadours: The
thousands of roads down which we travel lead us, ultimately, to no
one's home but our own.</TE>

<HD>Writing for the Sake of 'The Guys'</HD>
<DH>In the aftermath of 9/11, journalist Anne Nelson found a
way to do her part for New York's firefighters</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the days after the World Trade Center fell, Anne Nelson, a
combat-correspondent-turned-journalism-professor, sat in her ivory
tower at New York's Columbia University having what she calls "a
crisis of marginality."</LD>
<LD>   The story of a lifetime had rained down on her city, and all she
could do was sit eight miles uptown and fret about the safety of
students she had sent to gather the news. There was no point in
volunteering for the rescue and recovery operation at ground zero--it
needed people skilled in building trades, not literary types.</LD>
<LD>   Then came Sunday, Sept. 23, the day Nelson learned that they also
serve who sit and write. Nelson, her husband and their two kids were
spending the day at her sister's brownstone in Brooklyn. The phone
rang; the woman on the line said she knew of a New York Fire
Department captain who needed help. Several of his men were dead. In
a few days there would be memorial services, and he couldn't find the
words. Without a text, he feared, he would freeze, failing the
mourners and the dead. He needed a writer.</LD>
<TE>   Within half an hour, the captain was sitting with Nelson. She
didn't know it, but she was on the way to becoming a playwright--and
to moving from the margins to the center as the creator of "The
Guys," one of the first high-profile artistic conduits for a city's
grief.</TE>
<TE>   Now it may become a conduit for a nation's grief as well. The
Actors' Gang in Hollywood is staging the first production of "The
Guys" outside Manhattan, where it has been running since Dec. 4 at
the 86-seat Flea Theater. Tim Robbins, the Actors' Gang artistic
director, plays Nick, the captain, a role he also performed in New
York. Helen Hunt ends her run today as Nelson's alter ego, Joan.
Robbins' significant other, Susan Sarandon, will join him for three
performances this week, then Philip Baker Hall and Jeanne Tripplehorn
take over. "The Guys" will keep playing, with the cast rotating every
three weeks, as long as demand holds.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, says the play's original director, Jim Simpson, there
is a hush and sniffling--much sniffling--in the audience, but
frequent laughter as well. "The Guys" is not about the horror of the
firefighters' deaths, but a remembrance of their lives--and a certain
kind of humor belongs to a firehouse as surely as a Dalmatian or a
pole to slide down.</TE>
<TE>   The hush, the sniffling, the laughter--that's how it was at the
Actors' Gang as well on the night "The Guys" first played for Los
Angeles theatergoers. Nelson sat among them.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the moment when it became a play for me," she said the
next morning. For New Yorkers, she says, "The Guys" is as much a
dimension of their ongoing, firsthand experience of Sept. 11--a
public manifestation of the grieving within--as it is a play, a
reflection of reality seen at a remove. One passage talks about
circles of grief, the intensity changing by degrees depending on
one's proximity to the towers and one's intimacy with the dead. Los
Angeles is not the innermost circle.</TE>
<TE>   If "The Guys" can connect with audiences far from New York, Nelson
says, "maybe it has a quality that goes beyond reflecting an
immediate experience."</TE>
<TE>   The two actors are not so removed. Robbins grew up in Manhattan
and lives in Chelsea. When he saw "The Guys" in December, with its
original cast of Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver, he knew that
playing the captain could help him deal with his own crisis of
marginality. "It was something tangible that I could do." The biggest
challenge, he says, is to hold it together, to keep his own grief
from intruding on the captain's.</TE>
<TE>   For Hunt, this role has been a way of confronting memories she had
pushed down. On Sept. 11 she was having breakfast in a restaurant a
few blocks north of the World Trade Center; she dashed outside and
saw the aftermath with her own eyes. "I heard a plane flying way too
low and heard the most sickening sound I ever heard and walked
outside and watched the rest of it unfold."</TE>
<TE>   She had shunned news footage. But when she took the part of Joan,
her instincts as an actress preparing for a role told her to watch a
TV documentary on the disaster.</TE>
<TE>   "Moving toward the experience must be the right thing for me to do
now," she says. "I want to be in a room where this painful event is
brought up and we are together. I want to be in a room with people,
to connect with each other about that day."</TE>
<TE>   "The Guys" is an apt point of reentry, says Hunt, because it is
modest and personal. The actors read from scripts, a signal that this
is a document as well as a performance. "It feels to me like it's way
too early for playwrights to be writing about this, and yet this
seemed like the perfect first piece to come out of the experience--a
simple story about two human beings coming together, one who felt too
far away, and one who was clearly too close," Hunt says.</TE>
<TE>   There were more eulogies to write after that long Sunday afternoon
in Brooklyn. Nelson and her captain--who was off-duty on the morning
the towers fell--continued to meet during the next month to find
words for the men he had lost. The story of their collaboration would
make a good magazine article, she thought. But she could never write
it because it would violate privacies she refuses to
breach--including the identity of the captain and his ladder company.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 18, Nelson attended a charity dinner in a complex of
buildings that a month before had served as a makeshift morgue.
Sitting next to her was Simpson. His nonprofit theater company was
facing bankruptcy because of forced closures and dwindling attendance
following the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson and Nelson began to e-mail each other. The professor told
the veteran director about the captain and sent him one of the
eulogies. "That is a play," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson went to the firehouse to ask the captain if it was OK to
dramatize what they had experienced together. "I said, 'I want people
to know about these guys.' He said, 'Yeah, so do I.' " It took Nelson
about a week, working late at night in a room where her books share
space with her kids' Legos. By day, during her subway commute, she
would read from the copy of Aristotle's "Poetics" she used in
freshman English at Yale. It's the 2,400-year-old Ur-text for
playwrights, laying out the principles of effective drama.</TE>
<TE>   One night, she started to laugh as she typed. It suddenly hit her
that she was sinning against her own journalistic code.</TE>
<TE>   "I just made up a quote!" she thought, triumphantly. "And I'm
supposed to make up quotes!"</TE>
<TE>   She wanted to fill a gap in the public telling of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "New Yorkers were experiencing profound grief and loss, and yet
the media culture, especially television, moved almost instantly into
combative posture: 'America at War.' It wasn't capturing what I and
the people around me were actually feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Nelson was not exactly a theatrical novice. Performing in musicals
was a big part of her life in high school in Stillwater, Okla., and
at Yale. But after earning her bachelor's degree in American studies
in 1976, she became a reporter. Central America was her beat. Until
she became a mother 13 years ago, she often went where bullets flew
and the sight of headless corpses marred the roadsides.</TE>
<TE>   She e-mailed the script to Simpson, and he read it through tears.
His wife, actress Sigourney Weaver, took the part of Joan and
recruited her friend Bill Murray to be Nick.</TE>
<TE>   The air still smelled of smoke on opening night at the Flea, which
is a few blocks north of ground zero. The big test, for Nelson, was
how firefighters would react. They approved. Families of the dead
approved. The play continues to draw well, and a $500,000 film
version, directed by Simpson and starring Weaver and Anthony
LaPaglia, is being rushed toward completion in hopes it can be
released by Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Random House will publish "The Guys" next month; the book will
include a long afterword by Nelson about the New York Fire Department
and how it has gone on since the day it lost 343 men. Her captain
gave the last of the eulogies she wrote with him about two months
ago--"The Guys" says eight men from his ladder company died; that,
according to Nelson, is a slight deviation from fact to protect
identities. Firehouses have become her frequent haunts. "I am
becoming known as somebody who comes in and cadges a cup of coffee."</TE>
<TE>   Robbins and Sarandon plan to take "The Guys" to Ireland and
Scotland in August for a handful of performances. Nelson says the BBC
and the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. will air radio versions of the
play on Sept. 11. The Ensemble Theatre of Cincinnati will open a
production in September.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Nelson says, she has not made much money from "The Guys,"
but she is "struggling really hard" over what to do if she does.</TE>
<TE>   She marvels that a new door could have opened at this point in her
life as a writer. "Being 47, you think, 'Oh, I know what's available,
I know what the possibilities are.' And you wake up and there's this
whole range you never dreamed of." She tells herself not to get a big
head, not to be changed in ways that are not right for her.</TE>
<TE>   And maybe, when she drops in for those occasional cups of
coffee--dismal stuff, according to one of the laugh lines in "The
Guys"--somebody invokes a saying she says she often hears at
firehouses. It comes from Father Mychal Judge, the department
chaplain who was administering last rites to a downed firefighter
when he was killed by a falling chunk of the World Trade Center. She
finds it a useful reminder.</TE>
<TE>   " 'If you want to make God laugh, tell him what you're planning to
do tomorrow.' That's just written all over this."</TE>

<HD>Now on Stage: Un-Theater</HD>
<DH>Two regional playhouses are moving beyond traditional works
to present mime and circus acts</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAN BRESLAUER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Playhouses aren't just for plays anymore. At least not if mime shows
at two key Southland venues this summer are an indication.</LD>
<LD>   Geoff Hoyle's "Feast of Fools" closed recently at the La Jolla
Playhouse, and Marcel Marceau opens at the Geffen Playhouse on
Wednesday. In both cases, more such acts are likely to follow.</LD>
<LD>   La Jolla Playhouse and the Geffen Playhouse are unusual among the
nation's regional theaters in their ongoing commitment to mime and
the circus arts. Featuring clowns, jugglers, acrobats, puppeteers and
others more often associated with cabaret or variety, the genre is
characterized by a heavy reliance on physical skills. It's sometimes
referred to as "new vaudeville."</LD>
<TE>   Since the mid-1980s, La Jolla Playhouse has programmed an array of
new vaudeville artists--Hoyle, Bill Irwin, Avner the Eccentric, the
Flying Karamazov Brothers, Mump and Smoot, the Invisible Circus and
others--both in their own works and, in some cases, as actors in
plays. Before Marceau, the Geffen in Westwood presented "Do Jump!"
"Ennio" and Mabou Mines' "Peter and Wendy," which will be seen at La
Jolla in October.</TE>
<TE>   "I know Marcel Marceau is probably more cabaret and vaudeville
than he is theater, and I know that was stretching the definition to
a degree," says Gilbert Cates, Geffen Playhouse producing director.
"As a condiment, it's a wonderful thing for the theatrical meal. I
love the fact that the theater can be a place of surprise, where the
audience is never quite sure what they're going to be seeing."</TE>
<TE>   The tone is light, but the appeal is profound. "We give the clown
license to burrow into subjects we wouldn't let the philosopher
touch," says La Jolla Playhouse artistic director Des McAnuff. "It's
a key to digging deep, getting at sensitive subjects. If you make
someone laugh, you disarm them and take them places they may not
otherwise be willing to go.</TE>
<TE>   "I love that there's Geoff doing a show where not a single word is
said. It's so profoundly different than some of the other stuff we
do," continues McAnuff, whose season includes the recent production
of Moliere's "Tartuffe" and the upcoming "When Grace Comes In" by
Heather McDonald, and "Wintertime" written by Charles Mee.</TE>
<TE>   Marceau's Geffen run is billed as "the most intimate setting of
his illustrious career," and while that claim is difficult to verify,
it's certainly true that the acclaimed mime usually performs in
venues larger than the 498-seat Playhouse. His most recent appearance
in L.A., for example, was in 1999 at the Hollywood Bowl. "I did two
or three pantomimes," he recalls by phone from his Paris home. "But
it's not the same as a one-man show."</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning of his career, Marceau, 79, has been drawn both
to things American and to the legitimate stage. "I started mime as a
child, imitating Charlie Chaplin," he says. "I wanted to do theater."</TE>
<TE>   He began studies in 1944 under the tutelage of the famed mime
Etienne Decroux at Charles Dullin's School of Dramatic Art in Paris'
Sarah Bernhardt Theatre. Even in those days, the idea of mime in a
theater was unusual. "After the war, at that time there was no
theater mime in France, in the whole world," Marceau says. "There was
slapstick, comedy, musicals--all sorts of drama in the theater. Mime
was not theatrical at the time."</TE>
<TE>   He first played the U.S. in 1955. "When I arrived in America for
the first time, it was like something completely new," he says.
"Never have people seen a man on a stage making the invisible
visible, creating characters, this art form. It was wonderfully
accepted in the States."</TE>
<TE>   Marceau has come to the U.S. on tour almost every two years since
the mid-'50s and made numerous appearances on U.S. television.
"America is very important to me," he says. "It became my second
country almost. I touched today three generations. Very often young
people come to the show and say, 'That can't be Marcel Marceau, it
must be his son.' "</TE>
<TE>   Yet he continues to create new material. His performances at the
Geffen will mix standards from his repertoire with more recent
creations. "I keep the classical numbers because there are always
young people who have never seen me," he explains. But, he adds,
"there are at least five creations in the show that have never been
seen in L.A."</TE>
<TE>   The Geffen run came about when Marceau's management approached the
theater about a year ago. Cates felt that presenting the mime would
be in keeping with the Geffen's artistic mission that, as he writes
in the brochure for the upcoming seventh season, includes "presenting
diverse plays, musicals, circus, classic theater and new plays."</TE>
<TE>   The one unusual element in that mission statement is, of course,
"circus." "Circus and circus artists in America have had a bad rap
because we associate them with popcorn and elephants and that kind of
thing," Cates says. "We don't realize that there's artistry in the
circus that, if it doesn't predate it, is certainly close to the
beginnings of theater. You take Marcel Marceau and mime--is that
theater or is that circus? I think it's all theater."</TE>
<TE>   Cates, whose extensive producing and directing credits include
decades of television and film in addition to theater, has a
professional association with the circus arts dating to the 1960s.
"In my early days, I did a circus series on NBC called 'International
Showtime,' " he says. "I fell in love with European one-ring circus,
and the people who performed in it are extraordinary. I made a film
on it called 'Rings Around the World.' "</TE>
<TE>   So it seemed only natural, when Cates took over the Geffen--then
known as the Westwood Playhouse--in 1993, that circus artists would
be part of the picture. "How do you make the theater vital and
reflective of the time we're living in?" asks Cates, who founded and
served as dean of UCLA's School of Theater, Film and Television from
1990 to 1998 and instigated the university's purchase of the theater
in '93. "I don't know that any one form does it--comedy, straight
plays, musicals.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, I think people do things for reasons they
can't even understand and then they develop good reasons for having
done them," Cates continues. "I just happen to like these things."</TE>
<TE>   La Jolla Playhouse, founded in 1947, was revived in 1983 under
McAnuff's direction. About that time, the American theater at large
was just beginning to take an interest in artists such as Hoyle and
Irwin, both veterans of San Francisco's Pickle Family Circus.</TE>
<TE>   This interest would blossom into the new vaudeville movement of
the mid-to late '80s, which featured a number of performers,
including Irwin, who had trained at Ringling Clown College, the boot
camp for the three-ring circus bearing the same name. Irwin, Hoyle,
Avner the Eccentric, the Flying Karamazov Brothers and others began
creating their own extended shows, more akin to European than
American clowning. Some of these artists also worked with smaller
circuses, such as the Big Apple Circus, and at interdisciplinary
performance venues such as New York's Dance Theatre Workshop.</TE>
<TE>   These new vaudevillians caught McAnuff's attention. "I remember
becoming conscious of it around the time I came to La Jolla," says
McAnuff, who served as artistic director of the San Diego venue from
1983 to 1994 and returned in late 2000. "It seemed to fit into the
whole postmodern thing that was going on at the time."</TE>
<TE>   New York also came calling. Irwin appeared in a 1985 Broadway
staging of Dario Fo's "Accidental Death of an Anarchist" and
subsequently with his own shows, "The Regard of Flight" and "The
Courtroom." By 1987, when the San Francisco New Vaudeville Festival
was held on the campus of San Francisco State University, there
seemed little denying that there was indeed a trend.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, now that the new vaudeville is no longer as fashionable as it
once was, it seems less likely that other regional theaters will add
these artists to their rosters. "There's a creeping conservatism in
producing in not-for-profit and commercial theater," McAnuff says.
"People are less inclined to take chances than they were in the late
'80s. These are harder times to do that now, with the soft economy.
People are perhaps a little more cautious, and any work outside the
genres people are comfortable with probably suffers."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, artistic programming isn't only a matter of taste.
It's also about dollars and cents. New vaudeville can be cheap, but
it isn't always.</TE>
<TE>   In terms of the Geffen's three regular season shows and the
upcoming postseason Marceau engagement, it's been a financially mixed
bag. " 'Peter and Wendy' was expensive, 'Do Jump!' was expensive, and
Marcel Marceau is expensive only because he's Marcel Marceau," Cates
says. "With the exception of 'Ennio,' these attractions are not the
ones that cost us less. If you took an average cost of five plays in
any given season, they were above average. 'Peter and Wendy' and
'Ennio' did well. 'Do Jump!' did not do well."</TE>
<TE>   The large cast of the aerial variety act "Do Jump!" and the
puppets and puppeteers of "Peter and Wendy" are what made these
attractions comparatively costly. But the solo clown-caricaturist
Ennio Marchetto was much easier on the Geffen's pocketbook.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't take a genius to figure out that if you've got a solo,
it's going to be less expensive than 'Tommy,' " says McAnuff,
referring to one of the musicals he launched at La Jolla that went on
to Broadway and great commercial success. "That definitely would be
part of the thinking."</TE>
<TE>   Artistic directors are always on the lookout for shows that can be
presented cheaply, balancing more costly entries in the season. "It
becomes an instinct," McAnuff says. "If something is exciting and
smaller, immediately the antennae go up for anybody who produces
theater. But I don't set off to find smaller projects."</TE>
<TE>   Often with mime, new vaudeville or circus acts, theaters serve
more as presenters than producers, which means a smaller investment
of institutional resources. "I like to think of the playhouse as
having the freedom to do both presenting and producing," McAnuff
says. "With most of these artists, one hopes you do a bit of both.
But if you get to the point where you're mainly presenting, you've
got to look yourself in the eye."</TE>
<TE>   Most often, as with the recent Hoyle show, it's somewhere between
presenting and producing. "With Geoff in this show, some of the bits
come from his classic bits, but it's a new show in that it's a new
assemblage," McAnuff says. "All of the effort that you put into a new
show is required here."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, though, it's not about the bottom line. The continued
presence of circus arts at the Geffen Playhouse and La Jolla
Playhouse boils down to the fact that Cates and McAnuff feel it
belongs there. "It's a substantial chunk of what we do, as well
represented as any area of theater," McAnuff says. "I can guarantee
that we'll continue to work in this area."</TE>
<TE>   "I've always had a personal interest in the circus," adds Cates.
"So I guess in that sense I'm guilty of this very special interest
that I have. Theater is a celebration of life, and what is to be
excluded from a celebration?"</TE>
<TE>   Indeed. And what better welcome for an artist such as Marceau,
with his lifelong belief in the rightful place of mime in theater?
"I'm sure that mime today has become a very strong art form in
America," he says. "I'm happy to come back to L.A. I hope that being
in L.A. again we open doors for the future."</TE>

<HD>Las Vegas Loves Who?</HD>
<DH>Whatever it is he does, Danny Gans does it well enough to
sell out a theater named after him. Only here.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Five nights a week, just after 8 p.m., Danny Gans begins the same
sprint. He takes the stage in the Danny Gans Theatre at the Mirage
hotel and casino and transforms himself from a nobody, the guy you
haven't heard of, into the $10-million-a-year Vegas headliner that he
knows himself to be.</LD>
<LD>   He becomes an unambiguously loved, new-millennium Frank Sinatra or
Sammy Davis Jr.--the "Entertainer of the Year," as Gans is billed on
the Strip.</LD>
<LD>   He is "Entertainer of the Year" as immutable fact, as if it
doesn't matter what year we're in.</LD>
<TE>   Much about Gans' daily life feeds into this mantra, this constant
psyche job. In addition to the workouts and the dieting, Gans has
certain rituals for the protection of his voice. He carries bottled
water like an extra appendage and consults the best throat men in the
desert. He even considered having his family learn sign language so
that he could remain a husband and father without having to use his
vocal cords.</TE>
<TE>   What is he? Gans is an impressionist with a seven-piece band, but
if he was only that, he wouldn't be selling out his 1,265-seat
theater, at times weeks in advance, at $80 to $100 a ticket. People
come because of the tremendous word-of-mouth Gans has generated, and
because his advertising on the Strip is inescapable--the face and the
name on every passing cab roof like a CNN news crawl.</TE>
<TE>   But they also come because Gans has a peculiar talent: He is good
at sounding like other people, or at least appearing to sound like
other people. Lots and lots of them.</TE>
<TE>   On the Strip, tribute shows abound. What is different about Gans
is his packaging: He is not just Frank and Sammy and Dean, but Frank
and Sammy and Dean and, say, Hootie &amp; the Blowfish. And Macy Gray.
And Johnny Mathis. And Creed (if it's a Creed kind of night). And
Forrest Gump. He is whomever you need him to be, giving and giving,
and usually no longer than 30 seconds or a minute.</TE>
<TE>   In the course of his show, Gans does 50 or 60 voices, mostly of
singers. It is impersonation not as satire but as a breathtaking
achievement--entertainers of the last 50 years put in a blender and
presented as a mass-culture smoothie.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, Sinatra was Sinatra. But Gans is Sinatra doing "Hakuna
Matata" from "The Lion King."</TE>
<TE>   Gans just doesn't see himself as an impressionist. It fails to
evoke what he does, he feels. He will tell you that he is taking the
audience on an emotional journey. When he does a dramatic reading of
Al Pacino's climactic speech in "Scent of a Woman," the audience,
properly stirred, cheers. When he does Clinton, post-Monica, singing
the Gloria Gaynor hit "I Will Survive," they laugh. When he does
Henry Fonda from "On Golden Pond," they cry.</TE>
<TE>   Some people think the show is pure schmaltz--fascinating,
in a kind of horrifying way. But Gans will tell you that his show isn't
all that different in spirit from "The Producers."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever it is, Gans has been doing it in Vegas permanently since
1996, when he opened as the resident headliner at the Stratosphere.
In the years since, he has upgraded--first to the Rio and then to the
Mirage--and has become a so-called "destination act," a key cog in
the billions generated by the estimated 35 million people who visit
the Strip each year.</TE>
<TE>   At the Mirage, drawing customers from other properties used to be
Siegfried &amp; Roy's domain, but since Gans showed up more than two
years ago, the coiffed tiger tamers-illusionists have been forced
into the somewhat galling position of sharing the marquee.</TE>
<TE>   Gans performs between 75 and 90 minutes (he is off Mondays and
Fridays). His band is a finely tuned machine, churning out the same
bright notes in the same precise increments night after night after
night. Shows start at 8 and Gans rarely takes the stage later than,
say, 8:04. A digital clock at the foot of the stage, ticking off the
seconds and visible only to Gans, tells him when he's pushing 90. As
much as luring them in, Vegas entertainment is also about getting
people back out there--to dine or shop or gamble.</TE>
<TE>   Gans is part of this continuum, part of Vegas' growth as a
mega-entertainment theme park. As the city tries to lose its kitsch
entertainment image, shows have gotten classier and more elaborate.
But they have also grown more commercial. In today's Vegas, in the
biggest showrooms, you aren't shown to a table by a maitre d', and
you don't have dinner and drinks. You buy your tickets online, and
when you see Blue Man Group at Luxor, or Cirque du Soleil's "O" at
Bellagio, you sit in a theater that could be anywhere and afterward
you are supposed to buy a T-shirt or cap or video, which highlights
what you've just seen.</TE>
<TE>   The rampant commercialism makes sense and is only lamentable if
you have a frame of reference--the "old" Vegas of Louis Prima and
Shecky Greene. Today, when authenticity is replaced by a hyperactive,
pseudo-authenticity, Gans is ideal. He is more than just Vegas-ideal,
he is America ideal--as painless and convenient as a debit card
swipe.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, despite his Vegas acclaim, or perhaps because of it, Gans
remains outside the context of most media. He is big business,
incorporated as DG Entertainment. But he has never made it onto "The
Tonight Show" or David Letterman, and is probably less well-known
than a winner on "Survivor."</TE>
<TE>   As if to make up for this, Gans surrounds himself with totems of
his fame-by-proxy. Autographed sports memorabilia (a basketball from
Dick Vitale, a framed photo of Atlanta Braves pitcher John Smoltz) is
displayed in his dressing room, which has the look and feel of a
Marina del Rey pied-a-terre. The photo gallery outside the dressing
room stretches down hallways: Gans with Mel Brooks and wife Anne
Bancroft. Gans with Sylvester Stallone. Gans with Kevin Costner. In
each photo, Gans' smiling image symbolizes both his status and, once
again, that nagging question: Who is this guy and how did he get
here?</TE>
<TE>   He is, it turns out, several different things, all of which are
very American. He is the boy who fantasizes about becoming a
professional baseball player but never makes it, and who then
marshals his will and reinvents himself--as a devout Christian and,
later, as an entertainer in the grand sense of Sammy or Frank or
Dean.</TE>
<TE>   Such is the Vegas epoch in which Gans exists: The legends are
dead, but the imitators are alive, soothing us with their instant
nostalgia.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the Warhol argument," said Penn Jillette, who is one-half
of the gleefully perverse magic act Penn &amp; Teller. The duo recently
began a long-term run at the Rio.</TE>
<TE>   "It's as though Andy Warhol did not bring you the famous
Campbell's soup painting," Jillette said of Gans, "but instead took
an ordinary Campbell's soup can, redid the label to look like
Campbell's soup, and sold it right back to the same people as the
same soup."</TE>
<TE>   When Gans signed with the Mirage, he became royalty at Shadow
Creek Golf Course, his clubhouse locker in the same neighborhood as
those of comedian Billy Crystal and the Australian billionaire Kerry
Packer.</TE>
<TE>   Shadow Creek was built in 1990 by casino mogul Steve Wynn as a
golf haven for his high-roller customers. Today, green fees are still
$500 and you are still shuttled by limousine 15 minutes off the
Strip, into the beige nowhere. There, behind gates, exists a non
sequitur in the desert--an imported world of pine trees, bucolic
creeks, whispering willows and geese.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Monday morning at about 10, Gans teed off at the
par-four first hole, and drove his ball straight and true and more
than 250 yards. He was with two playing buddies--Andrew Abshier, a
concierge at the Venetian, and David Graham, pastor at the Christian
City Church. They kibitzed while Gans locked himself in battle with
the course. He had left himself about 140 yards to the green on the
first hole and was going to use his pitching wedge, but his
caddie--young, earnest--gently suggested a nine-iron. Gans took the
advice and promptly sailed his second shot over the green, bogeying
the hole.</TE>
<TE>   This, then, is Danny Gans at 45: good-looking and rich, someone
who plays a lot of golf and can count on at least five standing
ovations in his life each week. Gans prefers other archetypes: Little
League dad, hard-working entertainer, Christian family man. Gans, who
grew up in Torrance, lives with his wife, Julie, and their three
children (Amy, 14; Andrew, 12; and Emily, 7) in Henderson, Nev., 12
miles from the Strip, in a pricey, mountainside development called
Roma Hills.</TE>
<TE>   His three-story home is done like a French countryside manor, with
a faux log cabin on top of the house. The cabin is called the Lodge
Room and is one of several places in Gans' life that he goes to be
alone. Down from the main home is a carriage house for a huge private
gym and classic car collection--the Viper, the '55 Chevy Bel Air,
etc.</TE>
<TE>   Gans had arrived at Shadow Creek in a custom-rebuilt black Ford
pickup, with a "golf coffin" in the cab for his clubs and a trunk
door whose underside featured Gans' logo, "The Man of Many Voices,"
over a drawing of red socks and spats.</TE>
<TE>   The nickname is a show-biz trick, for what entertainer wants to be
known as "The Man of Five Voices"? The speed with which Gans moves
from one voice to another tends to obfuscate their accuracy. He opens
with a taste of Smokey Robinson's "Tears of a Clown," and from there
he's off and running, a human jukebox: Joe Cocker into Blood, Sweat &amp;
Tears into the Temptations into James Brown into Ray Charles into Tom
Jones into Garth Brooks into Michael McDonald into Janet Jackson into
Al Jarreau into Anita Baker into Aaron Neville into Macy Gray into
Prince into Hootie into Michael Bolton into Stevie Wonder. Then comes
a comedy interlude, impressions of George Burns and Jimmy Stewart. "I
try to start the show with total opposites," Gans said. "Left and
right, left and right."</TE>
<TE>   Pleasing the audience is what it's all about, and pleased they
are. At the Mirage, you can't get to the pool or to Siegfried &amp; Roy's
Secret Garden without passing the Danny Gans Theatre, where a
television monitor runs clips of his show in a constant loop. To
watch people as they walk past is to get a clue to his success: All
day, small crowds gather by the TV, mesmerized by Gans' magical
powers. From there it's only a short walk to the box office, and the
sad but titillating news that tickets for tonight's show are sold
out.</TE>
<TE>   You could reduce the audience to cultural stereotype--middle
America, with walking-around money--but you would be wrong, says
Steve Wynn: "Those are stereotypes that always fail on closer
inspection."</TE>
<TE>   As the former chairman of Mirage Resorts Inc., Wynn's casino
empire once included Bellagio, the Mirage, the Golden Nugget
and others; in May 2000, the company was bought by MGM Grand Inc., and
Wynn is now trying to get back in the game with La Reve, a resort that
would be built on the former Desert Inn site.</TE>
<TE>   In Wynn's expansive view of Vegas entertainment, there are no
demographics or taste classes. There are only people of all shades,
showing up on a "carnival midway" to be dazzled. It was Wynn who
turned his world-class art collection into a tourist attraction at
Bellagio, and it was Wynn who signed Gans to an eight-year contract
at the Mirage, converting ballroom space to accommodate a new theater
and lobby.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Gans had gone from the Stratosphere to the off-Strip
property the Rio, where he'd proven his might as a destination act.</TE>
<TE>   In the deal between Gans and the Mirage, Gans gets 90% of the
ticket revenue from his shows. (Estimates of his income range between
$10 million and $15 million.) The deal is a not-uncommon arrangement
known as "four-walling," wherein the entertainer incurs all
production and marketing costs and the hotel gets the foot
traffic--the 1,265 Danny Gans fans who will, the hotel hopes, stay
afterward to dine or shop or gamble.</TE>
<TE>   Wynn says that it cost $12 million to build Gans the space he
needed. More delicately, there was the matter of how to accommodate
the ego needs of both Gans and Siegfried &amp; Roy, who have been at the
Mirage for more than 10 years. In the end, the hotel's marquee grew
by 50 feet, and Siegfried &amp; Roy retained top billing. Gans, who
appears underneath them on "the big board," has billboards on
less-prominent parts of the property.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing I wanted to do was let Ziggy or Roy feel like they
were being" mistreated, Wynn said. "I kept saying to Ziggy, 'How
wonderful would it be to have entertainment [on the nights] you're
off?' Danny's a big star that's completely different from you.
Wouldn't that be nice to have him in the same building?' "</TE>
<TE>   Although Gans performs a grueling 46 weeks a year, his critics say
the entertainer helps ensure that demand stays high by performing
only five shows a week, half the amount of some top acts on the
Strip. ("If this kid tried to do more, he'd punk out," Wynn said of
Gans.)</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, part of the Danny Gans Experience is coming to Las
Vegas and not being able to get a ticket to see Danny Gans.
Comps--the free tickets given to high rollers--are another impediment
to the average consumer. One night, I sat next to a guy who
identified himself as a bookie from Puerto Rico. This was the sixth
time he'd seen Gans, he said, and while he seemed a bit weary of the
casino's largess, he also applauded every time Gans hit the first few
notes of an entertainer he loved.</TE>
<TE>   "The attention span of our audience is in general shorter, because
they're so excited to be here," said Pat Caddick, who was Gans'
keyboardist and collaborator from 1993 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Caddick, a respected arranger who now works with other Strip
entertainers, including Clint Holmes at Harrah's, remains in awe of
Gans' ability to hear voices at perfect pitch and spit them back.</TE>
<TE>   They had met, Caddick says, when Gans was opening for Lola Falana
and forged a bond during seven years--through work and religion and
family. Shortly before opening at the Mirage, Gans and his manager,
Chip Lightman, asked each band member to sign new contracts that
included detailed provisions regarding confidentiality agreements and
the forfeiture of any creative rights to the show's content.</TE>
<TE>   Caddick took the contract to a lawyer and eventually sued when the
show went on without him. Oddly, given that Gans' show depends on the
use of other people's material, the legal battle hinged in part on
Caddick's claims of copyright infringement--that he had, for
instance, written segues between songs--but more generally Caddick's
dispute with Gans sounds like the result of a bad divorce, with
Caddick claiming Gans had promised financial security in exchange for
his loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about Caddick one evening, Gans, who was in his dressing
room before a show, stiffened. "He was a musician in the show," he
said. "I didn't fire him. He didn't accept my [contract] offer." Soon
Lightman appeared, and Gans said he had been asked to comment on the
lawsuit. "It's so insignificant," Lightman said. "Literally, it's
just a ridiculous lawsuit."</TE>
<TE>   A week later, an arbitrator, acting according to an existing
contract between Gans and Caddick, ruled against Caddick's claims of
copyright infringement. But the judge did award Caddick $25,000 in
back pay, for services rendered. (The status of the federal lawsuit
is unresolved.) Gans and Lightman, meanwhile, immediately sent out a
press release to the Vegas media declaring total victory.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Gans' father, Sid Gans, tries to come to his son's show
every Wednesday and Saturday. Sometimes, Sid Gans turns 85 and is
introduced. Other times, he has recently turned 85 and is introduced.
Often, Sid Gans gets up and does an "impromptu" version of "Singin'
in the Rain." He gets a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   On the phone, Sid Gans said: "I could blow my nose and get a
standing ovation."</TE>
<TE>   He lives in Las Vegas, in a home bought by his son. His wife,
Alta, Gans' mother, is in a nursing home. Sid Gans goes to see her
every day, and his wife talks to him "with her eyes." They met, Sid
Gans said, when he was performing and spotted a gorgeous woman
sitting near the stage. He told the audience: "I'm going to marry
that woman."</TE>
<TE>   Sid Gans said he got his start in show business in the Catskills,
in the 1940s, performing first as a drummer and then as a comedian.
"I had a wonderful sister who stole material for me," he said. He was
in show business from age 18 to 35, at which point he took a job
selling televisions. It took him to Southern California, and the
family settled in Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   From an early age, Sid Gans said, Danny wanted to play third base
for the Dodgers. Today, he seems to bleed for his son's lost baseball
career, which took him from Torrance High School to Mount San Antonio
Junior College to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and then, briefly, to the
minor leagues in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Sid Gans can tell you the name of the player who stepped on his
son's Achille's heel, ending his baseball career.</TE>
<TE>   It was in the hospital after that incident that Danny Gans says he
met a man in the next bed who had cancer in his legs. According to
the story, Gans told the man about his career-ending injury, and the
man told Gans that God had put him in the hospital with cancerous
legs for a reason, to tell Gans that "God has another plan for you."</TE>
<TE>   "But you've gotta put him first in your life, which you didn't
do in baseball," the man told Gans. "Baseball was your god. If you put
him first, he will make you successful and happy and fulfilled,
outside of baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Gans has rededicated himself to the Lord. He calls
himself a devout Christian, and forms a prayer circle with his band
before each performance.</TE>
<TE>   Sid Gans is Jewish. He says he's happy that his son found
spiritual guidance, but he isn't interested. "They're pushin' me with
the church business," Sid Gans said of his family. "Every two months
I'd go to the church with them and I'd sit there aggravated."</TE>
<TE>   But he loves his son. He named him Danny, "because you can't be
mad with a person when you say 'Danny.' "</TE>
<TE>   There is an anecdote that Danny Gans likes to repeat: When he was
starting out in show business, Sid Gans took him to Vegas to see
Sammy Davis Jr.</TE>
<TE>   "He says, 'Do you get it?' " Gans said his father asked him
afterward. "I said, 'Yeah. You think I should be a variety
entertainer.' He says, 'Bingo.' I says, 'Why?' He says, 'Because he's
going to be dead soon, Frank's no longer doing it, Dean's no longer
doing it, who's left? You name me one person that has a live show
that makes you laugh and cry, there's music in it, it appeals to all
ages.' "</TE>
<TE>   It was a Friday afternoon, an off day, and Gans was eating one of
his protein-rich "garbage" salads in California Pizza Kitchen at the
Mirage. He was sporting a bloodshot eye--the result, he said, of
pushing too hard on stage the night before and bursting a blood
vessel.</TE>
<TE>   Without his makeup and the stage lights, Gans looked less
burnished, less pumped up (on stage, he wears a form-fitting,
sweat-resistant dark shirt to accentuate his biceps and pectorals).
His voice sounded thrashed, like someone who'd been rooting too
loudly for the Lakers the night before.</TE>
<TE>   If Sinatra and Elvis treated the Strip as a playground, Gans makes
a point of noting that he does not. "I finish my show, I write my
notes, I take my shower, eat my egg whites, I go out the back door to
my car, and I go home," he said.At home, Gans said, he will sometimes
leave out a note for his kids saying, "Daddy's not talking today,"
just so they know. Both Gans and his wife said the sign language
project ultimately proved unfeasible with three children. But it
seemed clear, as Julie Gans discussed her entertainer husband, that
she had grown accustomed to living with someone who regards small
talk as a threat to his livelihood.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Gans is a fit, attractive woman who offers a visitor some of
her homemade granola. She is the daughter of former Republican
California state Sen. Newton Russell. She grew up in La Canada
Flintridge and Sacramento, and met Gans at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.
"I get so defensive when people refer to it as Sin City," she said of
life in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Over lunch, Gans outlined his anti-Vegas Vegas day: Wake up, have
a protein bar, a cup of coffee, read the paper. Go to his gym for an
hour and a half. Have a protein shake. Hang out at home until 4 p.m.
Eat a protein-rich, low-fat salad for dinner. Head to the Mirage. Do
a brief rehearsal. Put on his makeup at 7. "If I'm hungry, I have
another protein bar." Do the show. After the show, if he's dieting,
he'll eat egg whites. If not, he'll have a chicken breast, broiled,
no salt, a little white rice and nonfat milk. If he feels like
cheating, he'll grind up a filet or have a glass of red wine.</TE>
<TE>   For the last five years, Gans has been named best all-around
performer in a lightly regarded, advertiser-driven annual readers'
poll by the daily Las Vegas Review-Journal. He has also been hailed
by such publications as Casino Journal and Gaming Today, which is
evidently where the term "Entertainer of the Year," comes from.</TE>
<TE>   No one really questions the efficacy of the title. On the Strip,
everyone plays the same hype game (a recent column by the
Review-Journal's Mike Weatherford noted that there are several
marquees on the Strip touting "Magicians of the Year," while
Siegfried &amp; Roy are "Magicians of the Century").</TE>
<TE>   Amid such hyperbole, there is little context for criticism. When
Gans moved from the Rio to the Mirage, Weatherford, the paper's
entertainment critic, did an updated review of his show. Weatherford
gave Gans a good write-up and graded him with an A-minus. Gans, more
than a year later, still hasn't gotten over the grade, which he
attributes to the fact that Weatherford came on a night when he did
Elvis and Michael Jackson, impressions he thought the critic had
already seen.</TE>
<TE>   "The No. 1 show in town should be an A plus-plus-plus, you should
like everything about it," Gans said. "If he was going to give me a
lesser grade like that, knowing the success I've had, he should have
come to me privately and said, 'You know what? If I review your show,
I saw it at the Stratosphere. The only thing I don't like is when you
do Michael and Elvis.' Don't do it the night I come.' "</TE>
<TE>   Giving the audience 110%, in Gans' view, is chiefly his job, but
not only his. He has talked, for instance, to his ushers.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a couple of pep talks with even them, saying we can't
take this for granted any time," Gans said. "Yes, I just won
'Entertainer of the Year' again and 'Comedian of the Year' and all
this kind of stuff, but you can't take it for granted. You have to
make sure that everybody that walks into that showroom--and now I'm
like directly talking to the usherettes and ushers--they're in for
the greatest moment of their life."</TE>
<TE>   In his show, after Hannibal Lecter and Barry Manilow, after
Inspector Clouseau and Kermit the Frog, Gans, finally, does Gans
himself. He relates the Danny Gans Story: A boy grows up dreaming of
playing professional baseball, reaches the cusp of that dream and
then suffers a career-ending injury. He finds God and goes into show
business. He gets to Broadway. Sometimes, this leads him into "The
Music of the Night" from "Phantom of the Opera." Other times he'll
sing a song from "A Brand New Dream," his CD.</TE>
<TE>   "I was 36 hours away from the major leagues," Gans said,
discussing his baseball career in his dressing room one evening.</TE>
<TE>   He was referring to his brief time with the Victoria Mussels, an
independent British Columbia team that played in the Class A
Northwest League and is no longer in existence.</TE>
<TE>   Later, pressed a bit for specifics, Gans said that the 36 hours
referred to something his coach had told him--that he was about to be
signed by the San Diego Padres Class A team in Walla Walla, Wash.,
and would likely be called up to the majors right away. A Padres
official was skeptical, noting that it took San Diego batting
champion Tony Gwynn nearly two years to make the same jump.</TE>
<TE>   Gans had gone to Canada after two seasons at Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo where, playing right field and first base, he hit .321 with
seven home runs one year and .262 with no home runs the next.</TE>
<TE>   "In those days, he was a great Elvis impersonator," said Tom
Hinkle, a retired pro scout who recruited Gans for Cal Poly from
Mount San Antonio College. "Him becoming a successful performer does
not surprise people who saw him as a young man," Hinkle said. "He had
the work ethic in baseball to be a major leaguer, he just didn't have
the complete talent."</TE>
<TE>   Gans applied that work ethic when his baseball dream went sour and
he became an entertainer. He tried comedy clubs but says he never
liked hanging out late at night. More relevantly, Gans came along in
an era--the 1980s--that shaped monologuists like Jerry Seinfeld and
Garry Shandling.</TE>
<TE>   So Gans went a different route. He got a job as an emcee-comedian
in a tribute show in Palm Desert called "Salute to the Superstars,"
and work of this ilk gave Gans his entree into corporate
entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   It remains a lucrative, if largely unknown, pocket of show
business--a way for the biggest names in entertainment to earn
$100,000 for an evening's work at a corporate chicken dinner and for
show business' middle class to pay the bills.</TE>
<TE>   Gans was good-looking but he wasn't a celebrity, and he knew he
had to sell himself. It involved learning the names and interests of
corporate middle managers at Heinz or Allstate Insurance, and being
available throughout the year with a show grounded in impressions
that would offer something for everyone. It involved putting together
a great press kit, not to mention a video that reassured potential
clients that you were funny and clean and unlikely to offend a
client.</TE>
<TE>   It involved becoming, finally, a kind of vaudeville schlepper
in an era of Marriotts and Hyatts, and it proved to be the perfect
warmup for the customer-is-always-right approach in Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Chip Lightman says he first saw Gans in 1990, at a corporate event
in Universal City. Theirs was a marriage of mutual
interest--Lightman, an experienced booker of corporate dates, with
clients including Mary Wilson of the Supremes and Tina Turner, and
Gans, performing earnestly in a tuxedo and looking to expand. Soon,
the corporate dates increased, with Gans traveling from his home in
La Canada Flintridge. Decent money blossomed into a
multimillion-dollar business--with Gans, at $25,000 a show, doing
more than 100 corporate events a year.</TE>
<TE>   But if Gans could play an atrium or open for Bill Cosby, his act
hadn't been tested as an attraction in itself. So Gans made a foray
into legit theater--taking his show first to the Coast Playhouse in
West Hollywood and then, in 1995, to Broadway, where he was sponsored
by the Broadway-producing Nederlander Organization, in association
with American Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   The show went into previews at the Neil Simon Theatre on Oct. 27,
opened Nov. 8 and closed Nov. 12, after just six performances. "Mr.
Gans tries to make up in tirelessness what he lacks in talent,
spontaneity and decisive point of view," the New York Times' Vincent
Canby wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Lightman and Gans prefer to fashion this episode as a limited
Broadway run that drew mostly raves--with blurbs from such
publications as the Wall Street Transcript, a financial news service.
"If we would've stayed there, he would've been a sensation on
Broadway," Lightman said.</TE>
<TE>   Gans goes further: Around the time he was contemplating a longer
stay on the Great White Way, one of his daughters drew a picture of
the family. In it, Dad was seen waving from an airplane. Should he
take a chance on Broadway stardom or put family first? Gans and his
wife prayed on it, and there was really only one choice to make.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks sent the Strip into economic shock.
A city that relies not just on tourism, but on the ceaseless influx
of people via the airport and the roadways was suddenly confronted by
no flow, and stranded visitors who were only interested in leaving.
More than 10,000 people were laid off within two weeks of the
attacks, many of them in the hotel industry. Empty cabs went back and
forth on Las Vegas Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Nine months later, you can still see the blood leave people's
faces when you bring up 9/11 on the Strip. This includes the four men
who were sitting in the clubhouse at the exclusive Shadow Creek Golf
Course on a Monday in June, having lunch after shooting nine holes of
golf.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Abshier, the concierge at the Venetian, said the
desperation to get out of town was so rampant that he had calls from
people wanting directions to the nearest Lexus dealership. Lightman
insisted the terrorist attacks only derailed Vegas' economy for a few
months, although many will tell you otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   "He's honored the Lord, and when everyone else wasn't going to the
shows, his was packed," Pastor Graham declared of Gans. "That's an
answer to your prayers."</TE>
<TE>   Some entertainers on the Strip performed the night of Sept. 11,
and the casinos, of course, stayed open.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Gans began performing the Saturday after the
attacks--emboldened, he said, by the return of Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   He closed his first night back with "God Bless the U.S.A."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh my gosh," said the "Entertainer of the Year," "there wasn't a
dry eye."</TE>

<DH>Electroclash musicians build on '80s synth tunes of their
youth. But the sound has yet to spawn a scene.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Synthcore, retro-electro, tech-pop, nouveau-disco, the new new wave,
electroclash. Call it what you will, there's a fresh sound
percolating in the dance underground, one that builds on the Luddite
beat that is techno, draws from the synthetic sounds popularized by
such groups as Human League in the '80s and wraps it all together
with a flamboyant touch of performance art.</LD>
<LD>   Most pop fans have never heard of artists such as Peaches, the
foul-mouthed and campy Canadian whose Casio beats could whip even the
most die-hard couch potato into a dance frenzy, or Fischerspooner,
the two-man band from New York whose live shows involve elaborate
costumes, pyrotechnics, wind machines and gargantuan videos.</LD>
<LD>   But to a growing community of dissatisfied indie rock and dance
fans, such artists provide a welcome reprieve from what has become an
increasingly static musical universe.</LD>
<TE>   "People are getting tired of seeing a DJ play records," says Felix
Da Housecat, the Chicago mix master and electroclash pioneer who was
tabbed by Rolling Stone magazine as one of 10 artists to watch this
year.</TE>
<TE>   After 15 years as a DJ specializing in house music, the
30-year-old "got bored with it" a few years ago and began adding '80s
electronics and vocals to the mix. "I just wanted to make normal
songs."</TE>
<TE>   Songs, as in verse-chorus-verse. Songs, as in people actually
singing. But songs that can still pack a dance floor till the disco
ball stops spinning and the lights are turned up.</TE>
<TE>   "It's some of the best music I've heard in 20 years," says Larry
Tee, a 42-year-old DJ and club promoter from New York who is
preaching the gospel of electroclash with the fervor of a fresh
convert.</TE>
<TE>   "House, trance, international club pop, trip-hop--they were boring
me to tears. I just couldn't play what was out there anymore," says
Tee, who used to spin dance music in clubs but now plays only
electroclash.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall in New York, he coordinated the Electroclash Festival, a
showcase that featured 30 bands, including Peaches, Fischerspooner
and lesser-known acts such as WIT, a sexy girl duo whose rendition of
the Cars' "Just What I Needed" drove the crowd wild.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Tee is planning a second festival as well as a tour
that will travel to seven cities, including Los Angeles, this fall.
Peaches, Chicks on Speed, Soviet, WIT, Tracy and the Plastics, and
two L.A. bands--Mount Sims and Dirty Sanchez--are booked to perform
when the Electroclash 2002 tour stops here.</TE>
<TE>   L.A.-based Emperor Norton Records is one of the strongholds for
electroclash. The label is best known for its cinematic
easy-listening acts like Fantastic Plastic Machine. But, sensing that
scene was burning out, Emperor President Steve Pross started signing
electro acts in 1999, beginning with Ladytron--a Liverpool band that
was described in England's New Musical Express as "art terrorist chic
meets Commes des Garcons catwalk show."</TE>
<TE>   The label's roster includes Miss Kittin, a French siren who
performs in a rubber nurse's uniform and whose ooh-la-la sing-speak
appears on records by three other recently signed Emperor Norton
acts: Felix Da Housecat, Golden Boy and the Hacker.</TE>
<TE>   "What attracted me to this kind of music is that it's artist- and
song-based," Pross says. "It's a style of music that can be played in
clubs, but you don't have to like dance music to enjoy it."</TE>
<TE>   Electroclash has its roots in techno, but is influenced by
synth-heavy '80s acts like Depeche Mode, Soft Cell, New Order and
Human League. Like the many DJs in the '90s who sampled records from
the '70s, the younger retro electro artists are pulling from the
music they grew up with.</TE>
<TE>   "All the artists that are involved in electroclash are all nearly
30, and we are just trying to mix techno music and '80s stuff--the
first music we ever heard," says the Hacker, a.k.a. Michel Amato, a
29-year-old Frenchman who records and performs with Miss Kittin.</TE>
<TE>   Amato began fusing the two types of music five years ago, but it
wasn't until 1999 that this emerging genre started getting
underground attention, and only last year that it was slapped with
the electroclash label. Although giving the genre a name might make
the records easier to find in record stores, which currently place
them in the existing indie rock, techno, house and electronic bins,
most artists reject the name "electroclash."</TE>
<TE>   Adult, a highly regarded minimalist electro band from Detroit, has
"had a subconscious resistance [to the term] since the beginning,"
says Adam Miller, the husband half of this husband-and-wife duo.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, 31, and Nicola Kuperus, 27, have been creating "the
forgotten sounds of tomorrow" since 1997. They object to the term
electroclash because they don't want to be lumped in with a genre
they see as gimmicky and faddish.</TE>
<TE>   When they performed at last year's Electroclash festival, they
were disappointed to follow a woman who did a "Flashdance" routine,
stripping off her top and pouring water on herself.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be like somebody putting on a punk rock festival, but in
between each band you have a clown--the Clash goes on, then it cuts
to a bunch of midgets getting out of a beat-up car, and then the Dead
Kennedys. We have a sense of humor, but we're very serious about our
music," says Miller, who declined an invitation to participate in
this year's festival.</TE>
<TE>   Kuperus adds, "When you're just a band who wants to play music to
give people a different choice in the horrible music scene that's out
there, it's just really frustrating."</TE>
<TE>   But to bands like Fischerspooner, whose two members--Casey Spooner
and Warren Fischer--met at the Art Institute of Chicago in the '90s,
performance is precisely the point.</TE>
<TE>   "Because we're not traditional starry-eyed musicians who are
desperate for a pop carer, we sort of manhandle the pop show. We
build it up and break it down and let things fall apart," Fischer
says. " 'Over the top is never enough' is sort of the mentality."</TE>
<TE>   None of the music in Fischerspooner's live performances is live.
The vocals are lip-synced and the music is canned to free up the duo
for ever more grandiose stage shows that include backup dancers,
smoke machines, special effects and improv.</TE>
<TE>   Spooner is known to grab cameras from people in the audience and
snap their pictures. He once stopped a song midway through to
question a woman in the front row about why she was yawning.</TE>
<TE>   With such spectacles to write about, it's no wonder that there is
growing media attention to the sound--from New York and London to
Paris and Munich.</TE>
<TE>   British magazines like the Face and New Musical Express have
devoted lots of ink to the burgeoning scene, and Rolling Stone, Spin
and other U.S. publications are beginning to review some records and
profile artists in the genre.</TE>
<TE>   But even with a growing number of electro artists and an
ever-broadening fan base, electroclash is mostly a media phenom at
present.</TE>
<TE>   "Movement is too strong a word," says Emperor Norton Records'
Pross. "It's a set of people with similar influences that are
connecting all around the world."</TE>
<TE>   As with everything that's hyped to the hills, whether this "set of
people" will appeal to a mainstream audience remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   The performance art element might prevent the genre from ever
attracting the type of following that translates into platinum record
sales or even major-label contracts.</TE>
<TE>   The only bands that have drawn that kind of attention are the
Faint, a Nebraska band that was the subject of a major label bidding
war but decided to stay with the indie label Saddle Creek; Peaches,
whose single "Set it Off" was licensed to Sony Europe; and
Fischerspooner, which just signed a $2-million deal with Ministry of
Sound, a label with a large presence in the United Kingdom.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I don't see electro music crossing over to the
mainstream," Pross says. "In America, most genres of music don't do
that. What happens is some artist will transcend the genre, but I
don't think the genre itself will become mainstream in this country."</TE>
<TE>   But Tee, who has a lot of money invested in making electroclash
the Next Big Thing, sees things differently. "One of my jobs is to
make sure it goes mainstream," he says, "so that we have another
option in the next 10 years other than lame and miserable and worse."</TE>

<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   By Mixing and Matching Styles, They've Got the Retro Beat</TE>
<TE>   Here are four entry points to electroclash:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Faint's "Danse Macabre," Saddle Creek (2001). The bridge
between rock and electronica, this Nebraska four-piece outfit uses
subtle guitar and drum parts to fill out its synth-driven sound.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fischerspooner's "#1," FS Studios/Ministry of Sound (2002). The
soft, simple and compelling melodies this New York duo layers over
robotic but dance-y beats are equally enjoyable in a club or in a
living room, but be sure to catch the band live. Wind machines,
videos, elaborate costumes and backup dancers make for a memorable
show.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Felix Da Housecat's "Kittenz and Thee Glitz," Emperor Norton
(2002). You can take the DJ out of the house, but you can't take the
house out of this DJ. His Chicago house music roots are still very
much in evidence in funky, complex and club-friendly mixes overdubbed
with the heavily accented sing-speak of French chanteuse Miss Kittin.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Peaches' "The Teaches of Peaches," Kitty-Yo (2000). This Canadian
smart aleck has a dirty mind and an even fouler mouth, but her
too-naughty-for-radio lyrics, rapped over songs that are equal parts
punk, rap and disco, are so catchy that listeners won't want to miss
a beat.</TE>

<HD>The Story of a City and a Life</HD>
<DH>In a rare solo gallery show, Frank Romero records personal
and L.A. history in his vivid images</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCARLET CHENG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An elevated freeway cuts through the middle of a vivid downtown
scene, a Los Angeles of a dozen skyscrapers and old buildings
throwing bright red shadows across canary yellow city blocks. There
are the old and the new, the present and the past all jumbled
together, in Frank Romero's fanciful signature style.</LD>
<LD>   It's not exactly accurate, but it's all recognizable and it's the
story of Romero's--and L.A.'s--life. In the upper left of his
painting "Downtown," there are Dodger Stadium and City Hall, and in
the upper right, the three spiraling cones of Watts Towers.</LD>
<LD>   "I single-handedly saved the towers in '59," Romero smilingly
boasts, half-serious, half-exaggerating, as he stands in the creative
sprawl of his 5,000-square-foot studio just north of downtown. He
likes to tell stories.</LD>
<TE>   "I was the teenage kid hired to collect money from people coming
by," he begins, "because they were trying to tear them down--and I
helped collect the money to run the tests." The tests determined that
the towers were structurally sound.</TE>
<TE>   These days Romero commutes from his home in Westwood, through
downtown, to reach his studio off the 5 Freeway, so the painting is a
kind of narrative of his commute. He points to the cartoonish pickup
truck barreling down a remarkably empty freeway. "This is my
off-white Chevy truck."</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the less-familiar places. "I grew up in Boyle
Heights," Romero says of an area in the painting's background. "This
is the Breed Street Shul. It's just a little teeny building in the
back. It wouldn't mean anything to anyone but me."</TE>
<TE>   Then he jumps back 50 years, pointing to a trolley about to run
beneath that jam-less freeway. "That's the P car going down 1st
Street," he says. "I took the P car to go to the movies, and the R
car down Whittier Boulevard to go to the Otis Art Institute when I
was 16."</TE>
<TE>   Romero's "Downtown," plus a few dozen other recent works, is on
view in a rare solo gallery show for Romero, at the DoubleVision
Gallery--rare because Romero has avoided commercial galleries, or
perhaps they have avoided him.</TE>
<TE>   However, his works have recently been seen in group museum shows.
He received a 2002 City of Los Angeles Individual Artist Fellowship
($10,000 to create new work), and his large-scale diptych "Fullerton"
was in the C.O.L.A. show that just closed at the Japanese American
National Museum. One of his best-known paintings, "The Death of Ruben
Salazar" (1986), depicting the journalist's accidental death when a
tear-gas canister hit him in a 1970 incident, is in the Smithsonian
American Art Museum's touring "Arte Latino" exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he hasn't really exhibited in a commercial gallery in many
years," says Mingfei Gao, director of DoubleVision. They met because
of proximity (her gallery is next door to the Craft and Folk Art
Museum, where he is a board member) and hit it off. The show was her
suggestion. "I wanted people to see his more recent works," she says.
"As he's gotten older, there's an ease in his paintings; they're
rather playful."</TE>
<TE>   When asked why he isn't shown regularly in local galleries, the
artist says he's just been too busy--he teaches; he has been working
on several murals; he does his artwork. Also, he observes, "it's so
hard to get a good dealer--they don't really look after the artists,
artists are at the bottom of the food chain."</TE>
<TE>   "I've been painting since I was 5," Romero says. "I'm 61 today." A
robust man with a full white beard and a ringing laugh, Romero
launches into one anecdote after another about friends, family or
bits of social and cultural lore, and how his work relates to it all.
He also admits to riding the roller coaster of fame. "I've been
around so long, I've been famous five or six times," he quips.</TE>
<TE>   As a teenager in the 1950s, he got a PTA scholarship to attend
Otis Art Institute, and he went in the evenings, on weekends and
during the summer. That was when Millard Sheets was the director and
attracted a slew of exciting artists as teachers. "I was privileged
to be there," Romero says. "That was the art school to be at in those
days."</TE>
<TE>   Later, he attended Cal State L.A., worked as a graphics designer
in the office of Charles Eames and, eventually, at the encouragement
of his friend painter Carlos Almaraz, spent a year in New York. But
it was a financial struggle and, he says, "I missed my car!"</TE>
<TE>   Returning to Los Angeles in 1969, Romero met the Chicano movement
head on. "The truth is, I'm fluent in English, I'm not fluent in
Spanish," he says. "But I still went home and ate menudo--but I grew
up in Boyle Heights, so I also ate sushi." That was because there was
a sizable Japanese American community in his neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   So Romero had to learn more about his heritage--he had political
discussions with his friends, he visited Mexico, and he eventually
joined with fellow artists Almaraz, Gilbert Lujan and Roberto de la
Rocha as "Los Four," creating work about Chicano life, including
about 20 murals around the city. When LACMA featured them in a major
exhibition in 1974--individual works as well as a large mural and an
altar they made collectively--Chicano art had finally arrived in a
major museum.</TE>
<TE>   In the catalog for the 2000-01 exhibition "Made in California,"
Howard N. Fox, curator of Modern and contemporary art at LACMA,
called Los Four "unified in their energetic gestural painting, their
bold palette, and most of all in their focus on the sights, rhythms
and pace of Chicano Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   However, Romero says, commercial success didn't arrive until 10
years later, in 1984, when he had a one-man show at the Arco Center
for the Visual Arts in the former Arco building downtown. "I really
began selling works after that," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The DoubleVision show, "Drawings in the Shower, Paintings in the
Car," focuses on upbeat images, with many variations on palm trees
and cars, especially old Chevys, showing up in the paintings, in
free-standing cutout sculptures, as well as on a new series of
ceramic platters that Romero has been experimenting with.</TE>
<TE>   "In a way, he's trying to make fun of the stereotypical images of
the city," Gao says.</TE>
<TE>   But the artist insists he is always concerned with politics. He
bristles when he recalls being criticized in print for not being as
political as the other members of Los Four. Perhaps it takes him
longer to process experience onto the canvas. Three of his large
paintings about seminal political events in the Chicano community are
among his best known--the depiction of Salazar's death, a work called
"The Arrest of the Paleteros," about the police crackdown on street
vendors in the early 1990s, and "The Closing of Whittier Boulevard,"
depicting a police response to an antiwar protest in the late 1960s.
The works were created as many as 10 years after the incidents.</TE>
<TE>   He pulls a print version of "The Closing of Whittier Boulevard"
out of a drawer. In it, L.A. police stand in a confrontational row
behind wooden barricades to stop a group of lowrider cars from
entering. An officer on horseback holds a spear, a reference to
conquistadors.</TE>
<TE>   "That's part of life in L.A.," says Romero, who witnessed the
event, "this threat of police brutality."</TE>
<TE>   The original painting was completed in 1984, and when asked about
the time lag, Romero explains, "It takes me about 10 years to do a
large painting like this. That stuff is hard for me to do, it hurts,
it's frightening."</TE>
<TE>   He finished his last large political piece, "The History of the
Chicano Movimiento," three years ago, he says; it's now at the
Carnegie Art Museum in Oxnard. And he says he continues to do
sketches and other preparatory work for similar pieces.</TE>
<TE>   His most famous mural, done for the 1984 Olympics, depicts a line
of cars, each sprouting a heart overhead, along the 101 Freeway
downtown.</TE>
<TE>   This month, he had nearly finished restoring the mural when
taggers almost obliterated it. "I'm going to go right back in and
redo it," he vows. Less vulnerable is the 1994 mural he did for the
Metro Rail's Normandie station, which consists of a lively parade of
multicultural citizenry.</TE>
<TE>   He shows off one of the new platters, with drawings incised into
the glazed surfaces. One he's especially pleased with features a '51
Chevy with its bulbous edges, against a turquoise sky.</TE>
<TE>   The same car appears again as a large cutout on the wall (a
version is in the storefront window at DoubleVision) and elsewhere as
a small painting on board, this time at night under starry skies.</TE>
<TE>   This car has a special significance for Romero, because it is his
father's car. "He used to get up at 7 in the morning to go to work,"
Romero says. The rest of the household would be asleep, but he would
drive off in his Chevy. "It kind of reminds me of my dad."</TE>
<TE>   Such personal details are his way of describing life in L.A. "I'm
a historian," Romero says, "in that funny kind of way."</TE>

<LD>Filmmaker Sam Jones and a soundman were hunkered down last year in a
Chicago recording studio shooting footage of the band Wilco. At the
time, the band was mixing the album that would be released nearly a
year later under the title "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot." The footage is for
"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart," a documentary chronicling the
making of the band's most recent record.</LD>
<LD>   In the scene, members of the band are engaged in an awkward
disagreement over the sound mix. The subtlety of their strained jabs
could be the exchanges of a couple that has stayed together too long.
Under the watchful eye of Jones' camera, the musicians attempt a
retreat to a shadowy recess, but remote microphones captured every
word.</LD>
<LD>   "I think if that argument had taken place earlier in the movie,
earlier in the shooting, they would've taken it outside, taken it
somewhere else," Jones says. Instead, it occurred well into the
shoot, when Jones had sufficiently bonded with the band and his money
had nearly dried up so that the filmmaker was down to a skeleton
crew. Many times in the course of making the movie, adversity has
worked in its favor. The scene, which has the nuance of fine drama,
would provide ample foreshadowing for a longtime member's rancorous
departure from the band.</LD>
<TE>   Personnel turnover was not the only dramatic flair presented to
Jones' cameras during the making of the film, which opens Friday in
Los Angeles. The experimental nature of the album led to a
much-publicized rift between Wilco and its record label, Reprise, the
band's switch to another arm of the Warner Music Group, Nonesuch, and
a 10-month delay in the album's release.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of drama was far from Jones' mind in October 2000 when
he wrote a letter to Wilco's manager, Tony Margherita, explaining his
idea to make a film about the band. Jones, a successful magazine
photographer whose work appears regularly in publications such as
Vanity Fair, Rolling Stone, Esquire, GQ and Premiere, wanted to make
a movie.</TE>
<TE>   "I specifically wanted to do an artist, a musician at the height
of [his] creative power. I always imagined what it was like to be in
France during the making of [the Rolling Stones'] 'Exile on Main
Street' and really see what was going on at the time, not in
hindsight," Jones says. "Kind of like 'Let It Be,' which is one of my
favorite movies, even though it's really hard to watch in some parts.
It was an attempt to see people do what they do at work without
faking it."</TE>
<TE>   Jones believed Wilco would be prime material for a film. "What I
really wanted to do was be around a band, and when I saw Wilco in
'99, I thought, 'This is it.' Their visual profile isn't too large,
no one really knows it. They're fairly naive about the camera, yet
they're making the best work of their career, right now. I thought if
the timing worked out, that would be the cool thing to watch, the
making of the record."</TE>
<TE>   Jones won over Margherita and the band's leader, Jeff Tweedy, over
dinner in an Italian restaurant in north Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "My first reaction was, probably, I didn't take it very
seriously," Tweedy recalls. "From time to time, people suggest some
things and it seems they don't have quite all their mental faculties
working. We get propositioned all the time by lunatics, and it seemed
like it might be one of those things except Sam sent his book, which
was probably a pretty smart thing since looking at his portfolio of
photographs showed that he was at least a successful and accomplished
photographer. He was interested in working with us, and I got a good
feeling that he was the kind of guy who does what he says he's going
to do."</TE>
<TE>   Tweedy took Jones for a drive around Chicago that November night,
playing for him the demos of the album, including what would wind up
being the opening track, "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart." "One of
us said, 'This would be a great title for the movie,' and guess
what?" Jones wrote in his online filmmaker's diary.</TE>
<TE>   The pair struck a deal granting Jones complete creative control
over the movie.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I asked for," Jones says, "was that I get to do
it, you guys don't come in the editing room, you don't tell me I
can't shoot something. I think you've got to give a lot of credit to
Jeff for thinking, 'This is the kind of film I would like to see.' "</TE>
<TE>   The band never regretted placing its trust in Jones, and his
experience behind the camera made for a mutually beneficial
experience. "We were pretty comfortable when we were doing what we
were supposed to be doing, like making music or playing shows, then
the cameras really disappeared," Tweedy says. "There were moments
throughout the process where I thought, 'This movie has gotten a lot
more interesting in spite of ourselves.' "</TE>
<TE>   Tweedy, along with Jay Farrar, headed up the vanguard alt-country
band Uncle Tupelo from 1989 until its 1993 major-label debut,
"Anodyne"; he formed Wilco in 1994. The new band began moving in more
adventurous directions with its subsequent albums, "Being There" and
"Summerteeth." For a collaboration with Billy Bragg that resulted in
two albums, Wilco composed new music to go with Woody Guthrie lyrics
and earned a pair of Grammy nominations.</TE>
<TE>   The idiosyncratic "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot," finally released in
April, not only broke new ground musically, but landed Wilco a
surprising debut at No. 13 on the pop album charts. A negligible
accomplishment in the world of teeny-boppers and MTV, but it garnered
a good deal of press, and critical raves followed Wilco, setting the
stage for the release of "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart."</TE>
<TE>   When Wilco entered the studio to record in 2000, the lineup
included Tweedy, guitarist Jay Bennett, plus Uncle Tupelo holdovers
bass player John Stirratt and drummer Ken Coomer. But on the eve of
the beginning of the shoot, dissatisfaction with the band's recording
led to the exit of Coomer and the arrival of two new members,
multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach and innovative drummer Glenn Kotche.</TE>
<TE>   Jones had made some television commercials, but had never shot a
feature-length film and admits he was naive about the process. "I was
like, 'I'll just get a camera and a crew and I'll go make a movie.' "
He was yearning for something that would allow him to "control the
creative and yet not control the subjects, where I didn't have to
dress them or find a location and I could just be more pure
photographer and tell a story." He turned to Peter Abraham of
fusionfilms, for whom Jones had shot some commercials. Abraham
brought with him the experience of producing more than 200 TV spots
and a successful series of extreme sports films.</TE>
<TE>   "Sam came to me with the project and he said, 'I really want to do
this. Do you want to, maybe, help me with it?' and I sort of naively
looked at it and thought, 'Six months? Yeah, great, we'll do it,' "
Abraham recalled. "Of course, it's turned into almost two years. It
started out as me helping Sam, and then my interest and involvement
grew, and over time as the scope of the project grew, I started
investing in it financially and really producing it."</TE>
<TE>   Jones was born and raised in Fullerton and attended Cal State
Fullerton, where he wrote and shot photos for the student paper, the
Daily Titan. Straight out of college, he became a regular freelancer
for the Associated Press, shooting everything from Dodgers' and
Lakers' games to the Academy Awards and space shuttle landings. That
led to a job shooting stills for Tim Robbins' 1992 film "Bob
Roberts."</TE>
<TE>   After a few less-than-satisfying experiences as a movie-set
photographer, he began shooting celebrities for magazines. During the
last decade, he's become one of the most in-demand photographers in
his field and turned down quite a few lucrative jobs during the
making of the film. This was especially painful as he was initially
the primary investor in what would eventually become a $500,000 film.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' background as a photographer helped him tremendously in the
making of the film, but he was also forced to develop skills as an
interviewer, particularly as the unplanned dramas unfolded. "One
thing I had to do more in this movie than I thought I would have to
is use more quotes, more talking heads. That served to tell the
story, which kept you wanting to observe the people going through the
changes."</TE>
<TE>   The film's visual style is the result of conscious choices and
pragmatism. "Usually, the coolest stuff for me comes out of limits,"
Jones says. "If someone had said, 'Here's $10 million and you have
the band exclusively for two years, go make a movie,' I wouldn't have
liked it as much."</TE>
<TE>   Jones went with a faster film stock that worked well in lower
light situations and produced a higher contrast. "I chose to shoot it
on film and shoot it on black-and-white. I thought that they are
definitely that type of band."</TE>
<TE>   The film was done just in time for its premiere in June at the
IFP/ West-Los Angeles Film Festival. The band, out on the road by
that time, saw "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart" for the first time
on the tour bus. It was a little disconcerting for Tweedy, who said,
"When you're in a movie, and it's a documentary, there's a lot of
stuff you don't remember the camera capturing. It's kind of like,
you're not watching a movie, you're watching your hair grow. You're
distracted by the shock of seeing an image of you projected."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever hear of choreophobia? From the Greek, it means "a fear of
dance."</LD>
<LD>   I've been thinking about choreophobia since reading about the case
of Iranian American Mohamad Khordadian, a 46-year-old pop dancer who
lives in Los Angeles and was visiting his homeland when he was
arrested for the crime of dancing. Iranian officials put it another
way when they tried and convicted him of "promoting corruption among
young people." His sentence was reported July 8: a lifetime ban on
performing or teaching dance and a suspended 10-year jail term. He
was also prevented from leaving Iran for 10 years, during which time
he could be imprisoned for infractions--if he was caught, say,
dancing in a room where there were women who were not his close
relatives.</LD>
<LD>   Imprisoned? For dancing?</LD>
<TE>   You only have to see the videos of Khordadian's cabaret-style
belly dance-salsa fusion (they're available in Southland stores that
cater to Iranian emigres) to know that his performances are as likely
to cause corruption as Kevin Bacon's in the 1980s
small-town-hates-dancin' movie "Footloose." That is, Khordadian's
performances could be deemed evil only by those who already fear the
dancing body--the choreophobics.</TE>
<TE>   Hard-line Islamic clerics in Iran are not the first of that breed,
although the hot spot for dance censorship these days seems to be the
Middle East. Remember the Taliban's draconian ban on dance and music?
People risked their lives to celebrate a wedding or just dance
cheek-to-cheek at home. Those caught dancing in Iran and Afghanistan
have been flogged. A man caught watching a music video was reportedly
sentenced to death by the Taliban. We're talking choreophobia with a
vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   In a milder form, fear of dancing surfaces among Southern
California Iranians, says Anthony Shay, founder of Avaz International
Dance Company. He and the company's current artistic director, Jamal,
an Iranian artist-turned-choreographer, specialize in dances from
what Shay calls the Iranian cultural sphere: parts of the Middle
East, central Asia and China touched by Persian literary and
aesthetic traditions. But Avaz hasn't succeeded in attracting many
Iranian American dancers. Iranian emigres support the company's
classically oriented Persian style, with its flowing movements and
modest but sumptuous court costumes. But parents worry about the
image of dancers. Would a daughter who appeared on the wicked stage,
for instance, attract an upright husband?</TE>
<TE>   The term "choreophobia" was coined by Shay when he was earning his
doctorate in dance history and theory in the mid-1990s. He wrote a
book of the same name and defines the term as "ambivalent and
negative feelings about dance."</TE>
<TE>   Dance historians like Shay are familiar with a long, sad,
worldwide saga in which the dancing body has been controlled,
tortured or wiped out. Colonial rulers, government officials and
missionaries, for instance, have a lot to answer for. They tried to
convince Hawaiians that God hated hula; they told Africans that Jesus
wouldn't like a prayer accompanied by moving hips. The British raj,
along with Indian social reformers, banned dancing by devadasis
(temple dancers) in 1945. In 1904, the U.S. government banned
religious dancing by native Americans. And long before that, African
slaves were not allowed their own dances and drumming.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling representatives of Western civilization didn't practice
choreophobia only on "other" bodies, the ones that danced to
different cultural drummers. Baptists of my grandparents' generation
thought that if you danced, you smoked, and if you smoked, you drank,
and if you drank ... well, you did other things. They grew up amid
powerful turn-of-the-19th century evangelism that could give the
anti-dance rhetoric of radical Islam a run for its money. Dancing, a
1914 Texas sermon advised, was "one of Satan's most fetching appeals
to the lust of the flesh." In Iran, at least, the dancing body isn't
always considered a horrible affront; if there are same-sex
gatherings where a whole lot of shakin' goes on, so be it.</TE>
<TE>   What's clear is that neither draconian political regimes nor
hyperbolic religionists can wipe out dancing. Slaves tapped their
feet (and developed tap). Anti-Nazi youth jitterbugged as embodied
resistance to Hitler's suppression of "degenerate art." Cambodians
practiced their classical dance in secret, escaping to the West when
the Khmer Rouge was systematically killing off artists at home. Even
in revolutionary Russia, Lenin couldn't eliminate the czar's Imperial
Ballet, because one crony was a fan and twisted the semiotics so that
aristocratic art form became "ballet of the people."</TE>
<TE>   "High" art forms tend to have more success being deemed
acceptable. Staged folk dance as well as Persian classical dance, a
relatively uncodified form influenced by ballet, are taught and
performed in Tehran, which suggests less than blanket intolerance of
dance by the regime and shores up the notion that the higher the art
form, the better it is protected. Still, concerts are likely to be
called "an evening of harmonious movement," so charged with danger is
the term "dance."</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Mohamad Khordadian. Who will stand up for him?
Having talked to a number of Iranian Americans, I think it's safe to
say they are less than thrilled about rallying behind a pop dancer as
an icon of freedom from oppression.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, he calls attention to the issue of human rights as
it relates to dance. It's a little-known fact that dance is a human
right. Naomi Jackson, associate professor of dance at Arizona State
University, is editing an anthology of essays on the topic. When she
spoke with Human Rights Watch, a representative told her that dancing
wasn't protected. But there it is, No. 27 in the 1948 United Nations'
Declaration of Universal Human Rights: "Everyone has the right freely
to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the
arts...."</TE>
<TE>   That statement just about covers it. The truth is that dance can
be about communication, rumination and celebration. It embodies ideas
about religion, politics, culture, individuality, survival and more.
Is dance dangerous? The governments and religions that try to control
and ban it think so. The Khordadian case is not just about one
dancer. Before him, people have died for the right to dance or,
sometimes, they have just died inside without it.</TE>
<TE>   That's enough reason to choreograph a response. March, chant,
write--make a movement in support of Mohamad Khordadian's human
rights.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

the subject for The Times and other publications.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm the last one to stick up for American Movie Classics and its
perfidious descent into advertiser-supported unwatchability ("No
Looking at You, Kid," by Susan King, July 21). Last year, I sent the
network several blistering e-mails regarding the changed policy; so
much for AMC President Kate McEnroe's claim that audiences haven't
noticed. But I must point out that that service's economics are
somewhat different from those at Turner Classic Movies.</LD>
<LD>   Turner is a division of a vastly larger company and has far
greater resources. As King pointed out, TCM owns its immense film
library (though she neglected to mention that in addition to Warner
Bros. and pre-1986 MGM films, the classic RKO titles are also part of
the Turner/AOL Time Warner holdings), while AMC must obtain the films
it shows from outside distributors (which are not bought but leased
for a limited period of time; moreover, the leases, for the most
part, merely grant AMC nonexclusive rights to air the movies). During
the past year or so, TCM has also leased titles from Universal and
Paramount that had previously been aired by AMC.</LD>
<TE>   While I certainly hope my cable system will soon carry AMC's new
Hollywood Classics channel, I can remember clearly the long wait we
subscribers suffered while waiting for it to carry TCM and, later,
the Fox Movie Channel. The unfortunate reality of the cable business
is that operators, squeezed for channel space, are generally
resistant to customer entreaties for new services.</TE>
<TE>   More important, AMC's actions are an ominous symptom of a
retrenchment in the way corporate America does business and treats
its customers.</TE>
<TE>   A.L. HERN</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The article on the creeping commercialization of AMC by parent
Rainbow Media struck a nerve. As an AMC devotee from Day One of its
existence, I was disturbed by the increased interruptions and by
plot-revealing "Back Stories" that should have been aired after the
movies.</TE>
<TE>   Rainbow Media's Bravo channel was another favorite. Then, with an
ironic insensitivity to its "art house" programming, it now
commercials these marvelous films to death. After one or two tries, I
gave up watching movies on the company's third channel, not willing
to endure a giant, heavy-handed "WE" in the corner of the screen. I
propose a special Golden Sledgehammer award to Rainbow in this year's
Emmys.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Turner, wherever you are, my eternal thanks for TCM.</TE>
<TE>   RONALD J. LEVIN</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Palisades</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Susan King is dead-on. For the past couple of years, AMC has
bounced from one terrible idea to another in its effort to "broaden"
its viewership.</TE>
<TE>   With an ugly lime-green logo and anti-charismatic host offering
edited, pan-and-scan versions of newer films with commercials, AMC
seems to be operating from a manual on how to actively drive away an
audience.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps President Kate McEnroe will succeed in transforming AMC
into a basic cable network interchangeable with a dozen others--about
all she is missing now is the wrestling.</TE>
<TE>   RANDY HENDERSON</TE>
<TE>   West Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   American Movie Classics has become unwatchable. The commercial
breaks, the edits for content and running time, and the skew toward
contemporary movies make a mockery of the network's claim to "film
preservation." But Susan King didn't mention an additional insult:
the network's broadcasting of "pan-and-scan" prints of classic films.
I've sent the network e-mails about this, but it hasn't responded.
Clearly, it doesn't care.</TE>
<TE>   Thank goodness for Turner Classic Movies; TCM is the cable network
truly dedicated to the history of film. It shows films from the 1920s
to the present, uncut and in their proper wide-screen format when
appropriate. TCM also produces great original programming.</TE>
<TE>   JOSEPH PUTERBAUGH</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I like to think I'm worth retaining as a viewer, so why can't AMC
spend the extra 10 cents to attach closed captions to the films it
shows? I refer to more recent films that I know have captioning
available, but AMC doesn't attach them.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the 12-year-olds it's trying to attract don't care, but I
need the captions. My hearing isn't as good as it was, and the
captions give me the ability to enjoy the films as much as I did
earlier. I can live with the commercials, but if AMC doesn't attach
the captions, I won't watch its movies. Plenty of broadcasts do have
captions, and AMC used to, until recently.</TE>
<TE>   If AMC thinks it can disregard its older audience and still
prosper, I'd say it's mistaken. Only time will tell, of course, but
it's not showing films that attract only younger demographic
audiences, so if it loses me and my aging friends, I'd guess it's the
next to follow in the business bust-out derby.</TE>
<TE>   HARVEY FEDER</TE>
<TE>   Tarzana</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thank you so much for your column on the dumbing down of AMC. You
expressed my own dismay at what has happened to what used to be my
favorite cable channel. Like you, I rarely watch it anymore, and when
I do, it's usually for one of its original programs.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, I sent an e-mail to AMC complaining about the
addition of commercials but never received a response. This was when
it was running commercials only between programs and before the
infestation of movies from the '70s, '80s and '90s. I wonder what Bob
Dorian thinks of the changes that have been made.</TE>
<TE>   About a year ago, I switched to digital cable and have been
enjoying immensely the Turner Classic Movies channel. Its weekend
pairing of "Sleepless in Seattle" with the 1939 "Love Affair" was
truly inspired programming. This is the kind of thing AMC used to do.
I only hope that my cable provider will offer the Hollywood Classics
spinoff of AMC when it starts up--I want my old AMC back.</TE>

<LD>Each Rude Guerrilla Theater performance takes you on a journey. I am
often shocked but never disappointed ("Honesty That Isn't for the
Squeamish," by Mike Boehm, July 21). Even with so-so material, the
experience stays with you for several days. This can only happen if
the theater has courage and intelligence. A fancy palace or ornate
scenery is not needed. Big bucks is often the kiss of death to
creativity, yet how can we not wish this gem of a group some greater
financial reward without altering its soul?</LD>

<LD>Regarding Kyle Mize's comments (Letters, July 21) about how the Boss
is gouging fans by charging $75 for the upcoming tour, I say this:
Obviously, you don't go to many rock shows and pay no attention to
the music industry. While McCartney, the Stones, the Who and many
others charge well above $100 for top-tier tickets, Springsteen's
seats are the same price in the entire venue and he only raised it
$7.50 since the 1999-2000 reunion tour. If you knew what it cost to
mount a major rock tour in 2002, you wouldn't be whining about the
"working people" so much.</LD>

<HD>How America Sounds Today</HD>
<DH>SummerFest director Cho-Liang Lin has designed a program
with a contemporary, home-grown flavor</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a distinct contemporary American accent to the annual summer
music festival in La Jolla this year. SummerFest music director
Cho-Liang (Jimmy) Lin has programmed two world premieres--John
Harbison's Quartet No. 4 and Esa-Pekka Salonen's "Lachen Verlernt"
(Laughing Unlearned).</LD>
<LD>   He's also invited those two composers plus composer John Adams to
participate in SummerFest, which runs Wednesday through Aug. 18.</LD>
<LD>   "Audiences will be captivated by what great stuff is being written
today," Lin said. "There's a broad spectrum of American music, if you
can count Salonen as some sort of American. There's nothing boring
about it."</LD>
<TE>   In addition to healthy doses of Bach, Beethoven and Brahms, Lin
wants audiences to hear American music and also get a chance to hear
the composers discuss their works. So he's scheduled a lot of
pre-concert lectures, workshops and open rehearsals,</TE>
<TE>   "I personally would have loved to have had the opportunity to talk
with Beethoven and Brahms, to glean insights into interpretations of
their music," he said. "The open rehearsals will be guided tours
through the music, so audiences worried about understanding something
in one hearing will have a chance to hear a person explain it
beforehand." Lin was speaking from Santa Fe, N.M., where the
violinist was playing in that city's annual summer chamber music
festival.</TE>
<TE>   John Harbison isn't reluctant to talk about his music. But he is
cautious. "I get a little more accurate idea of it after it's been
around for a while," he said recently from his summer home in
Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a program note I wrote for one of my pieces, but it
doesn't seem to have much to do with the piece a few years after. I
find it's easier to revise the program note than to revise the
piece."</TE>
<TE>   It's not that he doesn't know what he's doing. It's the process.
"In writing a piece, there's the distraction of how you go about it,"
he said. "Sometimes an idea is difficult to execute, how you want it
to sound. When you're writing it, you're interested in how you do it;
now I've gotten smart enough to keep my mouth shut about. But you
don't always have a clear sense of why you wanted to do it."</TE>
<TE>   His Quartet No. 4, to be played Saturday in Sherwood Auditorium at
the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, has three commissioners:
SummerFest, which asked the composer to write a piece for the Orion
String Quartet, which will be featured at La Jolla; the Santa Fe
Chamber Music Festival, in honor of its 30th anniversary; and the
Caramoor (N.Y.) Center for Music and Arts Inc. SummerFest gets the
premiere.</TE>
<TE>   It's in four movements and lasts about 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking of a dialogue or a dramatic action that carries
through the piece," the composer said. "With quartet writing, what I
want to do these days is bring some of the way operatic characters
relate into the world of chamber music--to get some of the dialogue
or dueting capabilities that Mozart exploits."</TE>
<TE>   It helps that he knows the playing of the Orion String Quartet
both as a group--he was on the composition faculty at the summer
Aspen (Colo.) Music Festival, where the quarter has appeared
regularly--and as individuals over the years. "It opens up some
possibilities and it closes off others, both of which are helpful.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a clear sense of what goes on when they play. There's this
very individual style. It's the way they communicate with each other.
Just even the physical aspect of the way they organize their
ensemble. Just the signals that they give to each other. All of that
is something you can't get from a tape."</TE>
<TE>   This is his fourth, but not last, quartet. "I leave time between
them so that the approach will change in a natural way. Any place
where you work in the same medium a lot, you have the benefit of
knowing things you don't want to do and some that you haven't done
before.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm certainly not finished with the medium. But I would have more
to say about this work in 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   Lin has collaborated with Salonen numerous times. When they were
planning the Aug. 10 concert--Salonen will conduct Stravinsky's
"Histoire du Soldat" and his own "Five Images After Sappho"--Lin
learned that Salonen had always wanted to write a solo violin piece
for him.</TE>
<TE>   "He had these sketches around for quite a long time," Lin said.
"This would be an opportunity to put them together." So they will
open the program with the world premiere of Salonen's "Lachen
Verlernt," commissioned by SummerFest.</TE>
<TE>   The program, with choreography for Stravinsky's "Histoire" by San
Diegan John Malashock, will be repeated by the same forces at the
John Anson Ford Amphitheatre on Aug. 12.</TE>
<TE>   Salonen was on vacation and could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The score was delivered to Lin in New York last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see the coherence in the piece right away," Lin said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see the density of the music gradually increasing; he
builds very strongly. The pace also builds, like variations tend to
do. It becomes more dramatic and chordal. So far, though, I don't
seen anything that's finger-twisting.</TE>
<TE>   "Now what I'm going to do is look at all the technical aspects
because my first and primary job is to make the piece sound good. As
soon as I identify the technical hurdles, the next thing to look at
is the structure, then the finer details of expression.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the great thing about working with a living composer. If
you have questions, you can ask him. Why does he call it 'Lachen
Verlernt'?" the music director continues. "What's the implied
emotional concept? That will be the most fascinating part about
interpreting the piece.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I have to figure out how to pronounce the name of the work.
That's the only difficulty."</TE>
<TE>   Lin will also be able to talk to composer John Adams, who will be
conducting his music on the concerts Friday and Aug. 9 concerts. Of
the other living American composers--Richard Danielpour, Michael
Daugherty, Scott Wheeler--only Robert Kapilow will be at SummerFest.
(Samuel Barber is also on the festival program.)</TE>
<TE>   "Every year," Lin said, "I look for new compositions to play and
program. If I can showcase California musicians, it's quite
appropriate for La Jolla. They're all very different; it's important
to hear what a fantastically huge range of colors and styles American
composers are using today."</TE>
<TE>   This year, he said, "I was pretty lucky to persuade three such
eminent composers to come by."</TE>

<LD>   BETH ORTON</LD>
<LD>   "Daybreaker"</LD>
<TE>   Heavenly/Astralwerks</TE>
<TE>   After an immensely promising 1997 debut album, "Trailer Park," in
which Orton experimented effectively with traditional pop-folk songs
and subtle dance/world textures, this English singer-songwriter
seemed stuck in neutral in her 1999 follow-up disc ("Central
Reservation").</TE>
<TE>   Orton seemed so uncertain about her next step after the acclaim of
the debut that she ended up doing a song twice--once in an acoustic
version and once with techno-dance strains.</TE>
<TE>   All the tentativeness is blown away this time out. In
"Daybreaker," Orton has regained her confidence, mixing the folk and
electronica touches so boldly that this collection makes "Trailer
Park" now seem hesitant.</TE>
<TE>   Not only are the sonic elements in this album (due in stores
Tuesday) more aggressive (production credits on the album range from
Victor Van Vught and Orton to the Chemical Brothers and William
Orbit), but Orton's vocal phrasing too shows far greater character
and force.</TE>
<TE>   None of that aggression and force, however, keeps the music from
having vulnerable elements. Indeed, the album's themes deal chiefly
with the tender edges of relationships. Although her imagery is
sometimes vague, the best songs speak about the mysteries of romance
and desire in a winsome, philosophical, convincing tone.</TE>
<TE>   In such tunes as "God Song" and "Anywhere," Orton, who is joined
on the album by such guest artists as Emmylou Harris and Ryan Adams,
doesn't present herself as either a victim or a survivor, but someone
trying to make sense of life's emotional swings. In the melancholy
"Thinking About Tomorrow," she sings, "These habits are so hard to
break/And they're so easy to make."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the music on "Daybreaker" is so eloquently designed that
it's easy to digest, but the emotional truths are so hard-hitting
that the music is difficult to shake.</TE>
<TE>   --Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   LINKIN PARK</TE>
<TE>   "Reanimation"</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros.</TE>
<TE>   It's one thing for J-Lo to put out a remix release, but when the
biggest-selling rap-rock band of 2001 decides to revamp the
multi-platinum debut that put it on the map, it's an irrefutable
event. Linkin Park's "Hybrid Theory" was accessible to so many
because its appeal had less to do with the novelty of its blended
genres than with the band's ability to craft passionate and extremely
catchy tunes.</TE>
<TE>   Although the inevitable rap-rock backlash seems to be on the
horizon, "Theory" is not only still on the national album charts
(approaching 7.5 million in sales), it still holds up musically. A
reinterpretation could have ended up feeling unnecessary, but
although there are some dead spots in the album, they are countered
by some enjoyable moments.</TE>
<TE>   An impressive lineup of quality hip-hoppers (including members of
Jurassic 5, the Roots and Dilated Peoples) adds fresh 'n' funky word
flows and wiggy-wiggy wax tricks to the local quintet's dark
grinds--and the result feels rejuvenated.</TE>
<TE>   Too bad the rock collaborations lack the same rhythmic and
innovative spark. Korn's Jonathan Davis lends his mournful croons to
the blockbuster single "One Step Closer," while Staind's Aaron Lewis
adds some harmonies on "Crawling," but neither cut does more than
magnify the atmospherics of the original.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the band's revisiting of both their funky and ferocious
material, should offer fans of the disc a fresh perspective while
they wait for something really new. Meanwhile, this album (due
Tuesday) offers those less familiar with the band another chance to
see why its heavy yet melodious hybrid worked in the first place.</TE>

<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   LAMYA</TE>
<TE>   "Learning From Falling"</TE>
<TE>   J Records</TE>
<TE>   Think Sade meets Joni Mitchell, and you'll have a rough
approximation of the latest pop discovery from Clive Davis' J
Records.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Kenya of Omani parents and schooled in England, this
28-year-old singer-songwriter worked her way through the ranks as a
backup singer for David Bowie, James Brown and Duran Duran, and was
featured on a couple of Soul II Soul albums.</TE>
<TE>   On this solo debut (due Tuesday), she cuts a wide swath through
the fabric of international pop. That's the Sade connection: sensual,
loping beats that meld hip-hop sensibility with Middle Eastern
percussion tradition beneath snaking melodies rooted strongly in
Western pop and rock.</TE>
<TE>   The Mitchell thread is her expansively literate lyrics that often
open up into free verse instead of compact pop verse-chorus form,
though at times tighter editing would bring her points home more
forcefully.</TE>
<TE>   Her other contemporary touchstone would be Alanis Morissette, with
whom Lamya shares an affinity for confession that can be
self-affirming ("Black Mona Lisa"), disarmingly vulnerable ("Never
Enough") or powerfully assertive ("Empires"). Vocally, she can sound
coquettish, purring and sexy, or roundly assertive, sassy and even
effectively cocky in the Tina Turner tradition.</TE>
<TE>   -- Randy Lewis</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 Public Enemy, "Revolverlution," Slamjamz/KOCH
Entertainment. The first release in three years by the politically
geared rap group finds Chuck D and Flavor Flav sticking to the
socially assaulting and musically battering guns they've been firing
for the past decade and a half. With eight new tracks, live
performances and remixes of classic PE numbers, "Revolverlution"
tackles topics old and new without missing a beat.</TE>
<TE>   --Kris Ex</TE>
<TE>   *** Knoc-Turn'Al, "Knoc's Landing," Elektra. This Long Beach
rapper cut his teeth on Dr. Dre's "2001" and "The Wash" soundtrack.
Knoc-Turn'Al's debut collection is a six-song "mini album," and each
cut contains enough bump for two songs. His flows are strong on the
Cali anthem "Str8 West Coast" and the gangster-fied "Let's All Roll,"
while his humor shines through on the off-kilter "Cash Sniffin'
Noses." The only thing lacking from this collection is, well, more

Vagrant. Like plenty of guys with guitars and problems, this
Portland, Ore., trio caroms between rage and reflection. Of course,
its debut would get pretty tiresome if it dwelt in either emotional
climate. In a craggy guitar setting that recalls Pavement, lyricist
Christopher Brady survives off-putting moments of indulgence and
petulance to pen gems such as "Winter," a vignette on growing old.

<DH>Family man Dana Carvey returns to movies with a healthier
view of ambition</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEAN MITCHELL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dana Carvey is back. That might not qualify as the show business
headline of the week except that for many Americans familiar with
Carvey's personal comic cavalcade--the Church Lady, Garth Algar and
spot-on impersonations of a squeaky-voiced Ross Perot and a goofball
George Bush Sr.-- the last thing they may remember about Carvey is
that four years ago, he nearly went away for good as a result of
botched open-heart surgery at the post-"Saturday Night Live" age of
43.</LD>
<LD>   A Bay Area surgeon mistakenly bypassed the wrong artery during an
operation on Carvey in March 1998, leaving him vulnerable to a heart
attack until another operation (with a different surgeon) corrected
the mistake. When the original doctor wouldn't admit his error,
Carvey sued for malpractice in the full glare of media sympathy. He
settled out of court and donated the proceeds to charity.</LD>
<LD>   "If he had called me and apologized," Carvey says, "I wouldn't
have had the moral authority to sue him because I didn't need the
money and didn't need the publicity. But he was literally denying
that he made the error, so I had to go through with it, knowing it
would lead to a lot of misinformation about me and my health."</LD>
<TE>   Today people frequently ask him how he feels, which he understands
but still must endure with private irony, especially when the
question comes, he says, from "giant guys smoking cigarettes." He
demonstrates: " 'You awright, Mr. Cahvey?' "</TE>
<TE>   He wants to tell them, "I never had a heart attack or heart
damage, so I'm completely whole and functional and very lucky. I
don't feel any effects, I feel great." And has for some time.
Nevertheless, while his "Wayne's World" pal and partner in mock
suburban slackerhood, Mike Myers, was busy inventing Austin Powers
and building another blockbuster Hollywood comedy franchise, Carvey
retreated to his Marin County home and became a stay-at-home dad to
his two young sons, Tom and Dex.</TE>
<TE>   He says the furious ambition that propelled him through his years
on "Saturday Night Live" (1986-93) deserted him after he and his
wife, Paula, had kids. "My career just didn't mean as much to me. I
thought I would just kind of fade away."</TE>
<TE>   "Dude!" Mike Myers surely would interject at this point. "No way!"</TE>
<TE>   "Way," Carvey might respond in a somewhat more earnest version of
Garth's geeky timidity.</TE>
<TE>   Yet today he's in Beverly Hills beating the drum (or at least
strumming the guitar) for his first project since the angioplasties.
It's a PG film called "Master of Disguise," in which he stars as a
nerdy Italian waiter named Pistachio who must discover his hidden
powers of impersonation to rescue his parents from an evildoer who
has kidnapped them.</TE>
<TE>   Co-starring James Brolin as his father and Jennifer Esposito as
his farcical spy-world "assistant," the Columbia film opening Friday
was written by Carvey and Harris Goldberg and directed by first-timer
Perry Andelin Blake. It's a tame comedy, and Carvey is nothing if not
humble about it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a movie that I made for my kids," he says, sipping bottled
water in his room at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where he is dressed for
an afternoon at the mall in baggy shorts, a polo shirt and off-road
running shoes. A former high school runner (his dad was track coach),
Carvey looks to be in wiry good shape without flaunting it. When
pressed, he admits, "I ran 45 minutes on the treadmill today and did
a half-hour of StairMaster. I may go lift weights and do a half-hour
bike after this. I work out a lot, but basically no one could be the
lead in a movie that has you in makeup 17 hours a day if they had any
kind of health issue.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some real eccentric things in it," he continues,
speaking of "Master of Disguise." "I'm always trying to get the
audience to laugh at stuff that can become indelible because it makes
no sense, that is so abstract and silly. But sometimes the audience
goes, 'What?' "Indeed, Carvey's "SNL" signature came from the small
details of his characters and impersonations, in contrast to the
larger-than-life spoofers like John Belushi, Adam Sandler and Chris
Farley, whose comic personas leaped off that stage and into the
movies.</TE>
<TE>   Tailored to Carvey's talent for mimicry, "Master of Disguise"
lifts off from the premise that Carvey's character is a descendant of
famous Italian impostors named the Disguiseys, who have a mythical
status in the Mediterranean, equivalent to Zorro. Relocated to
America, the Disguiseys have tried to go legit, but are forced to don
masks and prosthetic disguises when a villain (Brent Spiner) schemes
to borrow their powers to steal precious American artifacts for sale
on the black market.</TE>
<TE>   Meek and clueless, Pistachio Disguisey must save his parents by
suddenly learning the impersonation trade, which he does, clumsily,
under the tutelage of his grandfather (Harold Gould), who shows him
how to harness the magical force of "energico."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to dressing in drag as a 70-year-old woman and
applying a carpet of body hair to become a somersaulting Latin mambo
dancer, Carvey works in brief impersonations of David Niven, Robert
Shaw from "Jaws," Al Pacino from "Scarface" and, in the last scene,
George W. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   He interrupts the interview now to do Bush, dressing down the
titans of Wall Street for their accounting deceptions and hoodwinking
of shareholders. Here comes the voice: "I'm mad at ya but not too
mad."</TE>
<TE>   Although his "Saturday Night Live" fame grew from his
impersonations of Perot and Bush Sr., Carvey does not see himself as
a true mimic. "I don't consider myself a great impressionist. I just
tend to exaggerate. Darrell Hammond is more of a great impressionist.
I just get bored real quick and want to take it further. I was lucky
to get Perot and Bush in the same presidential season."</TE>
<TE>   In "Master of Disguise," he says, he wanted his Pacino imitation
to go on for six minutes until cooler heads prevailed. Fellow "SNL"
alum Adam Sandler, whose production company backed the movie, helped
rein him in. "Sandler has a much better sense of the rhythm of the
audience and what's acceptable for this style of movie, a cineplex PG
movie."</TE>
<TE>   So, Sandler was a hands-on executive producer? "He would come and
go, but in the end, it's really up to Adam and Jack [Giarraputo], his
partner. It's their company. They have really good instincts, whereas
I'll try to put stuff in that just plays to crickets."</TE>
<TE>   Sandler, who carries the clout a $25-million-a-picture star does
these days, offered Carvey the chance to come out of early retirement
and make "Master of Disguise." Carvey had written the first draft
before his heart problems but was wary after appearing in a number of
clunkers following "Wayne's World" ("You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll
hurl") and "Wayne's World 2."</TE>
<TE>   "I came off of 'Saturday Night Live' and did four really bad
movies," he says, referring to "Clean Slate," "The Road to
Wellville," "Trapped in Paradise" and "The Shot." "I was a puppet--I
didn't know. I wasn't a very good puppet. There was a point where I
had a movie green-lit at Columbia called 'Tucson,' but I'd already
done those four in a row and I just wanted to go home."</TE>
<TE>   He did a special for HBO and then a variety show ("The Dana Carvey
Show") for the Disney Channel that flopped. Living in Connecticut at
the time and commuting to Manhattan to do the show was a grind, he
says, and didn't fit in with his new life as a father. "At the end of
the day, it was way too much work. 'Saturday Night Live' is good for
cast members without children. You're writing all the time, you're up
all night. But I was glad that the variety show thing went away
because I couldn't do it physically and raise the family.</TE>
<TE>   "After that, we had to land somewhere. I came back to L.A., did
stand-up, then moved up to San Francisco, where Dex started
kindergarten. Then I blocked an artery."</TE>
<TE>   When Carvey took up Sandler on his offer to make "Master of
Disguise" with his company, Carvey did so with the understanding that
he would be given a director who would not try to micromanage his
performance. Blake, who was the production designer for Sandler's
films "The Waterboy," "Billy Madison," "Mr. Deeds" and "Deuce
Bigalow," was looking to get into directing and Sandler put him up
for the job.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, fine," Carvey says, "because I really just wanted someone
who wanted to have fun and wasn't going to try to control me on the
set. On 'Saturday Night Live,' I never really took direction in the
traditional sense. No one came up to me and said, 'Now remember, the
Church Lady is very condescending.' I would just try to get into a
trance, into a rhythm and let it go. In those [lousy] movies I made,
I had much more like a director director.</TE>
<TE>   "I was there on the sinking ship, thinking 'This really sucks,'
while everybody was high-fiving. So when those movies came out and
they did really suck, it made me believe in my instincts."</TE>
<TE>   Carvey speaks about his new film and career with the beatitude of
someone who has been to the mountaintop and decided it's less windy
down in the valley. He plans to spend August traveling the outback of
his home state of Montana with his family, blissfully disconnected
from box office grosses, TV and newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Like many of his fellow "SNL" alumni, he says, he doesn't have to
worry about money. "We're all comfortable financially at this point
and just trying to have fun. I'm not as rich as those guys," he says,
meaning Sandler, for starters, "but I have such middle-class tastes.
I have a $10 watch I'd never give up. I got a Suburban because I'm
terrified to drive anything else. I feel bad about the [emissions],
but I rationalized it because I hate to fly, so I'm on the I-5 a lot
and it's just me and the trucks."</TE>
<TE>   He points to an acoustic Taylor guitar leaning against a nearby
couch. "That's as good a guitar as there is in the world and that's
about $2,500. It's nice to be able to have that, but after that I
don't need anything else. I don't want any more things."</TE>
<TE>   With or without the factor of his show business wealth, Carvey
considers himself "a kind of normal baby boomer dad who's trying to
balance it all. You've gotta earn a living and how do you do that and
be a responsible parent and keep the marriage going? It's a big
challenge. It defeats a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone wants to know if he and Myers are still friends or if
they even speak to one another after sharing the huge pop-culture
moment of "Wayne's World." "I haven't talked to him in awhile,"
Carvey says, "but I hope we're friends. I feel like he's a friend. I
mean he's in rarefied air right now, you know? I guess Spielberg's
his friend or something, I don't know. Once you have kids, you tend
to hang out with other people who have kids, and Mike doesn't have
kids. He's in his 30s and going 1,000 rpm."</TE>
<TE>   Relieved, he says, that "Master of Disguise," made for the modest
Hollywood sum of less than $20 million, does not bring with it the
box-office expectations of "Spider-Man," he muses on the difficulty
of staying at the top of the heap.</TE>
<TE>   "I got way more famous than I ever imagined. I was just a player
on 'Saturday Night Live' and within a 30-month stretch, suddenly
'Wayne's World' came out and I was doing the president and went to
the White House and was on the cover of Rolling Stone. Boom! It
wasn't my master plan. I don't have to be a celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   "I can live comfortably without it and just do stand-up. It's an
unhappy road if you give it too much power. In Hollywood, even
well-meaning people are always asking you, 'You gotta show? You gotta
movie? Whaddya doin?' You can go a little crazy you know?"</TE>
<TE>   He reaches for the guitar he keeps handy for therapy and pleasant
distraction. Behind him, the French doors are open to a terrace, and
behind that the neatly manicured gardens of the hotel. "We are so
spoiled, we have so much," he says. "So many perks. Look where they
put me up."</TE>
<TE>   He says this as someone who has tried not to let money rule his
life. Not that it's easy. "When you're really hot, you're being
offered movies all the time and you're turning down millions of
dollars every day, then, finally, you think, maybe I can learn from
this one.</TE>
<TE>   "Money buys you time, but the stuff I like to do is either free or
near free: a matinee and dinner with my wife--and I don't have to go
to the fanciest restaurant; a hike in the hills; a hot shower;
playing with the kids. All the rest of it's kind of a waste."</TE>
<TE>   And the same for fame. "Fame is really just good for having sex
with different women, that's what it's good for. So if you're
married, it's kind of like a drag. But that's what it's good for,
period. George Clooney, he's living the life that all men want to
live."</TE>
<TE>   Coming from the mouth of Dana Carvey in the voice of Ross Perot,
this would surely be a laugh line. Coming as it does in Carvey's own
voice, it's that thing most surprising when delivered by a comedian:
an unadorned statement of fact.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The genres that are generally grouped under the smooth jazz label
actually consist of a collection of far-ranging musical styles--in
some cases only distantly related to each other. New age artists, for
example, now sometimes find themselves, to their surprise, listed on
the smooth jazz charts. In the always difficult to define vocal
arena, singers similarly cross over unpredictably from smooth jazz to
urban pop to R&amp;B.</LD>
<LD>   The net result of these random definitions is that some fine
playing, regardless of the label, can sometimes be overlooked.</LD>
<LD>   The Yellowjackets, "Mint Jam" (***, Yellowjackets Enterprises).
It's never really been quite clear why a group more accurately
described as a mainstream-fusion hybrid should occasionally be
spotted in the smooth jazz crowd. More than two decades after the
band was founded, the Yellowjackets--original members Russell
Ferrante on keyboards and bassist Jimmy Haslip, with newer players
Bob Mintzer on saxophone and electronic wind instrument, and drummer
Marcus Baylor--are still hard to define.</LD>
<TE>   This latest effort, a two-CD set recorded live at the Mint in Los
Angeles, is the product of the group's decision to produce and market
their own albums through their Web site, www.yellowjackets.com.
Longtime fans will be pleased at the inclusion of a few tunes from
the group's past, including "Tortoise and the Hare" and "Evening
News." More recent discoverers of the band will be impressed by the
work of Mintzer, whose inventive imagination is energized by a
high-voltage rhythmic drive.</TE>
<TE>   More problematic is the tendency of drummer Baylor to underscore
virtually every tune with a perpetual, sometimes maddeningly
repetitive backbeat. (It is a tendency, in fact, that diminishes
otherwise compelling work, not just with the Yellowjackets, but with
many smooth jazz ensembles.) On the exceptions, when the grooves are
more subtle and less predictable--especially on Mintzer numbers such
as "Mofongo" and "Runferyerlife"--the Yellowjackets present
convincing credentials as a first-rate, beyond-category jazz
ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   Fourplay, "Heartfelt" (***, BMG/RCA Victor). Like the
Yellowjackets, Fourplay is an all-star collective that has been
producing top charting, musically intriguing albums, in this case for
more than a decade. Three of the original group members
remain--pianist Bob James, bassist Nathan East and drummer Harvey
Mason--with guitarist Larry Carlton joining the group when Lee
Ritenour left in 1998. Also like the Yellowjackets, they have made a
label change, moving from Warner Bros. to RCA.</TE>
<TE>   Fourplay's primary asset is its extraordinary versatility,
combined with the capacity to slip easily in and out of pop-jazz
groove rhythms. Mason's stylistic dexterity adds lift and vigor, even
in the most rudimentary backbeat patterns, while James--despite all
his pop instrumental outings--has never lost his capacity to
improvise at a world-class level. All those qualities are amply
present in "Heartfelt," Fourplay's best album of the past few years,
with the diverse high points ranging from East's soulful vocal on
"Let's Make Love" and James' arching, spontaneous melodizing in the
title track to Carlton's simmering blues lines in his own "Goin' Back
Home."</TE>
<TE>   Russ Freeman, "Drive" (** 1/2, Peak Records). Guitarist Freeman
has led the pop-jazz group the Rippingtons since the late '80s. Often
urged to step out on his own, he has done so rarely. It's unfortunate
that this solo endeavor doesn't do more to portray his skills beyond
those displayed in his leadership role. But most of the tracks here
could easily have been produced by the Rippingtons.</TE>
<TE>   The exceptions are a pair of numbers--"Villa by the Sea" and
"Bellagio"--in which Freeman dips into the nuevo flamenco style with
considerable success (something he also has done occasionally on
Rippingtons albums). On a few other tracks, the misty presence of
Chris Botti's Miles Davis-like muted trumpet adds some much needed
color to the proceedings. But, more often, the repetitious backbeat
rhythms (there they are again) tend to dull the music to the point of
distraction.</TE>
<TE>   Keiko Matsui, "Deep Blue" (**, Narada Jazz). Keyboardist Matsui
has never had particularly strong jazz credentials, but there were
passages in her early recordings and live performances in which she
played with admirable lift and enthusiasm. Lately, although her
albums are frequently charted in the smooth jazz category, she has
drifted into atmospheric piano stylings similar to the efforts of
John Tesh (who also, amazingly, charts as a smooth jazz artist).</TE>
<TE>   To her credit, she has succeeded in what she has chosen to
do--create an album filled with floating melodies and warm,
enveloping sounds. For some, that will be a formula for musical
wallpaper; for others, Matsui's music will serve nicely as an
accompaniment for relaxation or meditation.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Duboc, "Duboc" (***, Gold Note Music). Talented
singer-songwriter Duboc has followed up her first album, "With All
That I Am," with an even more splendid effort. This time out, she has
included a healthy sampling of her own well-crafted, pop-jazz-styled
originals, written with composers such as John Mitchell, pianist Jeff
Lorber and bassist Tony Dumas. She is also surrounded with a powerful
collection of players, including Lorber, Dumas, keyboardist Patrice
Rushen, flutist Hubert Laws, saxophonist Gerald Albright and
trumpeter Oscar Brashear.</TE>
<TE>   All this adds up to a performance that refuses to be limited by
smooth jazz references. Beyond her fine writing, Duboc's singing has
the strength and originality to quickly move her into the top level
of jazz vocalists--regardless of genre. The evidence is particularly
apparent in the few tunes written by others: a pair of
Bacharach-David tunes, "Walk on By" and "Anyone Who Had a Heart," and
a spirited romp through Wayne Shorter's "El Gaucho." Still developing
as an interpretive performer, still seeking some darker qualities in
her vocal timbres, Duboc nonetheless is an artist with enormous
possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Marilyn Scott, "Walking With Strangers" (** 1/2, Prana
Entertainment). Veteran singer Scott, who has six previous releases,
has been doing quality work for years without ever quite breaking out
of the pack. Part of the problem may be her comfortable fit in the
smooth jazz/urban category, which has kept her from getting the
attention of a wider audience.</TE>
<TE>   Scott is right on target when she describes her style as
"sophisticated soul." But on this album, the undercurrent of rhythm
and the repeated backbeat tend to distract from the full expression
of that quality. A few tracks provide an opportunity to hear how good
she can be in the right setting: Joe Vanelli's turbulently rhythmic
"Beginning With You" and her own touching anthem to peace, love and
tolerance, "No Room for Hate." Beyond those tracks, however, despite
the presence of the Yellowjackets' Ferrante and Haslip, the album as
a whole fails to frame Scott in a fashion that fully displays her
sophisticated musical abilities.</TE>

<LD>The label: Memphis International Records.</LD>
<LD>   The artists: R&amp;B-soul singer Carla Thomas, guitarist Alvin
Youngblood Hart, and old-timey folk and blues musician Harmonica
Frank Lloyd.</LD>
<LD>   The location: 2200 Union Ave., down the street in Memphis from Sun
Records, which launched Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis.</LD>
<TE>   The principals: Bob Merlis, one of the deans of record company
publicists, and David Less, former executive director of the
Memphis-based Blues Foundation</TE>
<TE>   The mission: "MWL," short for "music we like," says Merlis, who
took an early retirement offer from Warner Bros. Records last year
after 29 years. Memphis International was born out of a call he got
last year from old friend Less.</TE>
<TE>   "He asked me if I'd lost any money in the stock market," Merlis
says, "and of course I said yes. Then he asked if I'd had any fun
doing it, and of course I said no. So he said, 'I've got an idea:
Let's go into partnership on a record label. We could have a lot more
fun and maybe not lose any money.' "</TE>
<TE>   Merlis and Less are both lifelong roots-music lovers who now
constitute the committee of two that makes all decisions for Memphis
International Records. "It's just me and him and our piggy bank."</TE>
<TE>   The plan: They expect to issue a half-dozen albums a year. The
initial budget is extremely modest by conventional music-business
standards. "It's only five digits to begin with," Merlis says. At
Warner Bros., "we spent far more on press kit folders for one
Fleetwood Mac album than we anticipate spending to release six albums
a year."</TE>
<TE>   The inside joke: "We talk to each other four or five times a week
and it's always, 'Hello, Jerry? This is Ahmet' [referring to famed
Atlantic Records execs Jerry Wexler and Ahmet Ertegun], or 'Hi,
Leonard. It's Phil' [Chess Records founders Leonard and Phil Chess].
I saw Jerry at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominating committee
meeting recently and told him we call ourselves Ahmet and Jerry, but
we still don't know which of us is which."</TE>
<TE>   The future: The label's next release will be an album of holiday
music played by the jazz group Gypsy Hombres in the style of
guitarist Django Reinhart. The title? "Django Bells."</TE>

<HD>Wild Animals in S. Africa Reserve Are Going Once,
Twice--and Gone</HD>

<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HLUHLUWE UMFOLOZI PARK, South Africa</DL>
<LD>HLUHLUWE UMFOLOZI PARK, South Africa -- The startled giraffes darted
nervously around the open-air pen, trying to avoid the gaze of the
curious humans outside. In a nearby corral, hippos huddled under the
shade of a wooden canopy. Only the white rhinos refused to be cowed,
striking a menacing pose in a direct challenge to any overly
inquisitive passersby.</LD>
<LD>   The fate of these animals, on display with a variety of other
beasts at a recent game auction in this picturesque sanctuary in the
eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, would soon be decided under the
auctioneer's hammer.</LD>
<LD>   Billed as the largest and most exotic pet shop in the world, the
annual auction allows the province's wildlife authority to shed some
of its surplus game from protected areas while offering game farm
owners and collectors of so-called trophy animals a chance to stock
up.</LD>
<TE>   Collecting wildlife is a growing--and sometimes
controversial--trend in South Africa as ranchers sell off their
cattle and buy exotic herds.</TE>
<TE>   Some purchase the animals to boost the potential of aesthetic and
photographic tourism on their private game ranches. Others buy the
animals to be hunted, capitalizing on an ever-expanding sector of the
tourism industry here.</TE>
<TE>   Rhinos, buffaloes and large antelopes such as nyalas and kudus are
among the choice trophy animals snapped up for hunting on game
ranches.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the flavor of the month," said Jeff Gaisford, a
spokesman for the eco-tourism and marketing department of the
KwaZulu-Natal wildlife authority. "A hell of a lot of private game
reserves are being established. A lot of farmers are selling off
their cattle and stocking [their farms] with game. It's driven by
money and eco-tourism."</TE>
<TE>   Edmond Rouillard, chairman of the Natal Game Ranchers Assn., said
a dramatic decline in cattle prices in recent years spurred many
farmers to move into stocking game. In addition, keeping wildlife is
less labor intensive than nurturing cattle, which need to be
regularly dipped for pests, immunized, fed and fenced off.</TE>
<TE>   Wild animals roam freely within the vast acres of the game farms
and feed off their natural habitat.</TE>
<TE>   According to Theuns Eloff, head of the Center for Wildlife
Economics at Potchefstroom University in the country's North-West
province, the number of private game farms in South Africa has
increased significantly.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, there were 3,357 such ranches in the nation, occupying
about 17 million acres of land. By 2001, the number had jumped to
5,344 farms, occupying more than 27 million acres. The percentage of
the country's agricultural land housing game farms, which are not
part of government-owned nature reserves and national parks, rose
from 8.4% in 1993 to 13.3% in 2001, Eloff said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice driving around your ranch and seeing giraffe and zebra
and whatever else you have there," said Rouillard, who owns a hunting
ranch. "And it's an earner of foreign exchange, in the long run, if
you have trophy animals."</TE>
<TE>   A special license is required to stock game on a farm, and a
so-called exemption permit is needed if wildlife is to be hunted on
such ranches. A game farm must meet certain standards, including
having ample acreage to allow the animals to run free.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of hunting a beast ranges from $350 for an impala to $700
for a zebra, $1,000 and up for a kudu and $10,000 for a buffalo. The
price tag for bagging a trophy is paid in addition to a daily fee of
between $350 and $450.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife and hunting officials estimate that the industry
generates about $150 million in profits each year and attracts about
5,000 foreign hunting safari tourists.</TE>
<TE>   An average 10-day safari costs about $10,000, depending on the
type and number of animals killed, according to representatives of
the hunting industry.</TE>
<TE>   The generally prohibitive price means that more tourists go on
photo safaris, but hunting safaris are by far an easier way for game
farm owners to make a quick profit.</TE>
<TE>   Gaisford said that although the wildlife authority is often
criticized for selling animals it knows will eventually be hunted,
the killing of some wildlife is necessary to help manage the game
population.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't sell them, we'll shoot them anyway," he said. "We
have to control the number of animals in the park. So it's a double
benefit [to the buyer and to us]."</TE>
<TE>   At this year's auction, 389 animals were sold from the live
displays. Buyers were able to scrutinize the animals in outdoor pens
before viewing them on a bank of television screens set above the
auctioneer's head. An additional 1,629 beasts were bought unseen from
a catalog, pending the capture of the animals.</TE>
<TE>   The game, which included white rhinos, hippos, giraffes,
ostriches, blue wildebeests, wart hogs, zebras, nyalas and kudus,
netted about $1.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   The price of a white rhino averaged $22,700. One nyala went for a
record $2,600, while five hippos sold for about $4,100 apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Sandra Hassard spent about $41,000 for a male and a female rhino.
Her father was among the first cattle-ranch converts, transforming
the family farm into a game sanctuary nearly 10 years ago. Although
they still herd cattle, the Hassards have concentrated over the last
five years on renovating the ranch, called Falaza Game Park, into one
of the most upscale game farms in KwaZulu-Natal.</TE>
<TE>   Falaza boasts white rhinos, giraffes, nyalas, impalas, zebras,
wildebeests and small duiker antelopes. Leopards, which are natural
inhabitants of the region, also have been spotted here. Hippos and
crocodiles live in a nearby river.</TE>
<TE>   "Tourism has boomed," said Hassard, who specializes in photo tours
but also allows game hunting on her property. "People have jumped on
the bandwagon in order to make money. It's a great income earner."</TE>
<TE>   Hassard, whose Falaza ranch covers 22,000 acres, said the average
hunting safari tourist at her farm spends more than $5,000 per visit,
compared with a photo safari traveler, who spends upward of $500.</TE>
<TE>   At least 75% of her clients come from overseas, she said, with a
large proportion from the United States. Of the 4,530 tourists who
visited Falaza last year, 30 came specifically to hunt, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Fleur Wales-Baillie took over a cattle ranch in northern
KwaZulu-Natal two years ago, as one of three landholders in the
Khumbula Thina Trust, which covers about 15,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   She started stocking her ranch with game, but despite the easy
profits, she has vowed never to allow hunting there.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't allow the animals to be disturbed," Wales-Baillie said.
"When the animals increase, I'll just expand." And then she'll bring
in predators, such as lions, to naturally control the numbers of
other species, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her aim is to create a preserve where animals can roam freely and
tourists can come to view them. She has already stocked the ranch
with kudus, rhinos and bushbuck antelopes. Ten elephants and 34
buffaloes she bought recently are due to be delivered next month.</TE>
<TE>   Wales-Baillie said she supports ranchers' drive to get into the
game reserve industry, but only if the focus is on nature
conservation.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's wonderful," she said. "The whole idea should be to
have one giant biosphere. It should be about conservation."</TE>
<TE>   Area game farm owners, however, believe that Wales-Baillie will
eventually be forced to cull her wildlife stock as the number of
animals grow. Allowing hunting of the surplus animals would be the
most reasonable and cost-effective course of action, hunting
professionals insist, arguing that those against the practice are
simply "misinformed" about the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Those who choose to prey on game say it's all about wildlife
management, and they maintain that there are several benefits to
killing animals.</TE>
<TE>   A lack of habitat and vegetation to support all the animals as
they breed is the prime reason for reducing their numbers through
hunting, the hunting proponents argue. Too much game on too little
land causes erosion and other environmental degradation. Hunting
industry officials also insist that most of the animals targeted for
the kill usually are older bulls, in their final stage of life, that
are unable to properly feed or fend for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just a matter of going out every day and blasting
everything to death," said Mark Dewet, a licensed professional hunter
with 20 years' experience.</TE>
<TE>   A professional hunter is required to guide each hunting tourist on
safari, with the help of experienced trackers to seek out the game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's much more humane for an animal to die from a hunter's bullet
than from disease or starvation. An old bull is eventually going to
die anyway," said Jonathan Arn, 28, of Alabama. He visited South
Africa on a 16-day hunting safari last month and bagged 17 animals,
including nyalas, kudus, waterbucks, wildebeests and a zebra.</TE>
<TE>   But it has not been easy for South Africa's hunting industry to
escape controversy. The recent revelation that the northern province
of Limpopo reportedly was considering allowing the controversial
method of hunting lions kept in captivity, known locally as "canned
hunting," sparked heated debate.</TE>
<TE>   Animals used in canned hunting are kept in confined areas. Unlike
on most regular game farms, the hunting guides often know exactly
where to find the prey. In the most extreme cases, the animals are
killed while trapped in their cages.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents argue that the element of fair chase in hunting doesn't
apply to canned hunts because animals have no chance of escape.</TE>
<TE>   "This type of hunting shows an extreme lack of respect for life
and compassion for the dignity of these animals," Chris Mercer, who
represents a coalition of wildlife organizations, told Johannesburg's
Saturday Star newspaper last month.</TE>
<TE>   But hunters who stalk their prey on sprawling game farms and
nature reserves argue that unlike canned hunting, theirs is a clean
sport, not slaughter. They insist that they take time to soak up the
beauty of the scenery around them and appreciate the greatness of the
quarry.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just about shooting stuff," said Arn, who added that he
had 50 animal trophies on his wall at home before his visit to South
Africa. "We're also enjoying the outdoors, enjoying the animals."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SOLDHA, India</DL>
<LD>Like most of Kashmir's victims, Halima Doie lost her life in a fight
she didn't want and was powerless to stop.</LD>
<LD>   An illiterate Muslim woman born into the once nomadic Gujjar
tribe, she and her family lived, or died, at the mercy of the men
with guns.</LD>
<LD>   It didn't matter what side the men were on: Separatist Muslim
rebels who roam the rugged canyon in this disputed land were as much
a danger to the Doies as their Hindu neighbors.</LD>
<TE>   The Hindus who live nearby, farmers mostly, didn't always have
guns. Then police armed them with bolt-action rifles to give them a
fighting chance against the rebels' Kalashnikovs, and they formed
civilian militias.</TE>
<TE>   All Halima Doie had to defend her honor, and her children, was a
small ax.</TE>
<TE>   When the Hindu militia members turned their sights on her, she
tried to hide behind a rough-hewn wooden door, but it wasn't strong
enough to stop drunken men bent on rape. Resisting only made them
more angry, and their punishment was ruthless.</TE>
<TE>   They opened fire with the rifles issued for self-defense, pausing
to pull back the bolt and reload each new round into the chamber,
until they had killed Doie, her sister-in-law and three of their
children.</TE>
<TE>   Fears that a war between India and Pakistan could go nuclear have
brought a new sense of urgency to diplomatic efforts to resolve
competing claims over divided Kashmir. But after 13 years of
insurgency by the guerrillas in Kashmir, who are battling for an
independent state or union with mostly Muslim Pakistan, the fight
over the Himalayan territory has become one of the world's most
entrenched disputes.</TE>
<TE>   By arming thousands of Hindu civilians in village militias, Indian
authorities have only deepened the religious divide in a territory
once known as a paradise of tolerance.</TE>
<TE>   There is mounting evidence that some of the militias are using
their power to intimidate unarmed Muslim civilians, drive them from
their homes and, in at least three reported cases, kill those who
resist, said Tapan Bose, secretary-general of the South Asia Forum
for Human Rights.</TE>
<TE>   In some villages, the militias, known as village defense
committees, are commanded by outsiders who belong to the Hindu
extremist movement Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or RSS, Bose said. He
suspects that they are using the defense committees to push a radical
political agenda, just as Muslim extremists are using the Kashmir
issue to advance their jihad, or holy war.</TE>
<TE>   Police have been giving guns to the civilian militias, usually
.303 rifles that are throwbacks to British colonial rule, since 1996.
Almost all of the weapons have gone to Hindus. Muslims very rarely
join the civilian militias, primarily because they don't want to be
seen supporting state authority, Bose said.</TE>
<TE>   "What do we need guns for?" asked Hajra Paswal Doie, the matriarch
of the ruined family. "If we take their weapons, we are not secure.
The village defense committee members can kill us and then say we
were killed 'by our own people.' "</TE>
<TE>   By that, she meant the Muslim guerrillas, who were the first to
harm her family, in May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   At least four rebels armed with assault rifles came to the Doies'
village of Teeno, a scattering of mud-brick homes built on a steep
canyon wall, in search of a suspected informant.</TE>
<TE>   Only they knew what, if any, evidence there was against Ibrahim
Doie, Hajra's son.</TE>
<TE>   He was working in the fields, tiny plots with just enough soil
amid the mountain rocks and boulders for a few rows of corn, she
said. The flash of a memory brought tears streaming down her
weathered cheeks.</TE>
<TE>   She paused to dry them with the edge of her head scarf.</TE>
<TE>   "They locked all the women and children in the house and then tied
his hands behind his back," she said, and then the words were too
hard to say. That was the last she saw of her eldest son, the only
defender the family had.</TE>
<TE>   After the rebels targeted Ibrahim Doie, the local Hindu village
defense committee went after his widow, Beeran. A group of about 10
armed men, led by two commanders, visited the house almost daily,
Hajra Doie said.</TE>
<TE>   "These people used to come to our village, take food and
milk--anything we had and then leave," she said. "It was all by
force."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the militia members tried to justify the visits as a
search for the enemy, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "They asked us where the militants are," Hajra Doie said. "We told
them: 'How do we know? For us, you are the militants.' "</TE>
<TE>   After constant harassment, her daughter-in-law Beeran consented to
an affair with one of the men. On the night of May 8, about a year
after the rebels led Beeran Doie's husband away, the Hindu men turned
their sights on her sister-in-law, Halima.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The only surviving witnesses to what happened that night are Hajra
Doie's grandchildren, who are too young and traumatized to recall
many details. But one thing is clear, Hajra Doie said: When the men
demanded sex, Halima kept refusing and tried to fend them off by
bolting the door.</TE>
<TE>   Hajra Doie was away from the small house that night and didn't
return until hours after the militia commanders had gone berserk, and
then gone home.</TE>
<TE>   "I went into the house and saw the bodies in a pool of blood," she
said. "Everybody was lying on a single bed, including the wounded
children.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw Arshan, she started crying and said: 'My mother was
killed by the security forces. My brother was killed by the security
forces. Everybody was killed by the security forces.' "</TE>
<TE>   The five victims were Halima Doie and her sons Salim, 5, and
Shabir, 3, as well as Beeran, and her son Jaffar Hussain, 12. The
women left three orphans: Jameela, 8 months, Gulsham, 2, and Arshan,
5, who has a thick scar where a bullet grazed her left forehead.</TE>
<TE>   Police in Doda, the district's administrative center, confirmed
that two men, Rajinder Singh, 20, and Subash Chander, 22, have been
charged with the murders and said they are in jail awaiting trial.
Both men are commanders.</TE>
<TE>   The men confessed to the murders but said they only started
shooting after Halima Doie refused to the open the door and then
swung an ax at them when they broke through, said a senior police
officer in Doda.</TE>
<TE>   He spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not get approval
from superiors to talk to a reporter. He also insisted that the
killings were an isolated incident, not evidence that civilian
militias might be out of control.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not a police atrocity because it was not an organized
crime," he said. "The only organized crimes here are carried out by
the militants."</TE>
<TE>   In the six years since Indian authorities have been arming
civilians in the village defense committees, most have been set up in
Jammu province, where slightly more than half the population is
Hindu, according to India's government.</TE>
<TE>   The main concentration of defense committees is in the region
around Doda, one of Jammu's six districts and a key battleground
between the Indian security forces and at least eight separatist
armies.</TE>
<TE>   India's government has deployed several hundred thousand troops
and paramilitary police to fight an estimated 3,500 guerrillas
throughout Jammu and Kashmir state. New Delhi claims that they are
still being reinforced by infiltrators from the roughly one-third of
the Himalayan territory under Pakistan's control.</TE>
<TE>   About 10,000 civilian defense committee members have been armed in
Doda district alone, the overwhelming majority of whom are Hindus,
the police official said. He said that Hindus have received most of
the guns distributed to civilian militias because Muslims were too
slow to volunteer.</TE>
<TE>   "The only reason is that when we constituted the VDCs, they didn't
come forward," he said of Muslims. "Now that we have exhausted the
weapons, they are coming to us, and we simply don't have any more to
give them."</TE>
<TE>   Each village defense committee has up to a dozen members,
including as many as three commanders, low-ranking deputies who
receive little training or pay. Each commander receives an honorarium
of just $31 a month, which he is supposed to share with the civilian
volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   To discourage any trigger-happy villagers, police ration their
bullets, giving out 50 each. The militias are supposed to file a
report any time they fire, and requisitions for new ammunition must
be approved by the district police commander. In Doda, village
defense committees ask for more bullets almost every day, the police
official said.</TE>
<TE>   Kahn Chand Sharma, a retired Hindu government worker, belongs to
the defense committee in the village of Barshalla. Sharma, 65, lost a
brother, a grandson and three nephews in a massacre by guerrillas in
1996, and said he will fight with whatever he has if terrorists
strike again.</TE>
<TE>   Sharma complained that his ration of bullets is running low.</TE>
<TE>   "Even the [militia] members who have exhausted their ammunition
aren't getting more from the police," he complained.</TE>
<TE>   "The government is not helping the village defense committees at
all. If we fire a single bullet, we're interrogated."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After the slayings of the Doies, the eight surviving members of
the family moved up the mountainside, to the village of Soldha, where
they live in a cowshed with two rooms that are always dark.</TE>
<TE>   The family's survival now depends on Hajra Doie, a weak, barefoot
woman who doesn't know her own age. Her necklace provides a hint. One
of the medallions is a silver coin, an inheritance from her father:
"George V King Emperor," it says on the front. "One rupee India
1916," read the words on the back.</TE>
<TE>   Guessing at her age again, Hajra Doie said she remembered her
father bringing her to this once peaceful place as a little girl,
just before what she called "the Big War."</TE>
<TE>   That was in 1947, when the British agreed to Muslim demands for a
separate state and carved Pakistan out of India, granted both
independence and left them to sort out the status of the princely
Himalayan kingdom of Jammu and Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   The two countries immediately went to war over the territory, and
the conflict continues, with families like the Doies caught in the
cross-fire.</TE>

<HD>Corporate Misdeeds a Benefit for Labor?</HD>

<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years of railing against corporate greed, union leaders are
suddenly finding an audience--and with it, perhaps, their best chance
in decades to remake labor's image and build membership.</LD>
<LD>   But some activists say top union officials aren't moving
aggressively enough to capitalize on the public flogging of corporate
America. They want to see strategies that create drama and call
attention to larger issues, such as the diminished clout of workers
in a freewheeling global economy.</LD>
<LD>   "I think they're caught off-guard," Washington political
consultant Jim Grossfeld said of the union establishment. "Some of
these guys have been knocking themselves out for 20 years, trying to
get a message across. Now all of a sudden it's on the front page ....
People want labor to take the gloves off. But it's hard to change
gears so quickly."</LD>
<TE>   Several prominent union presidents agreed that they must do more
to broaden the public debate beyond accounting reform, and predicted
that would happen over the next six months.</TE>
<TE>   Two said they plan to launch major initiatives soon, one
addressing the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs, another taking on
large employers who fail to provide health benefits for low-wage
workers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a question of whether or not we can make this about
something more fundamental," said Andy Stern, president of the
1.5-million-member Service Employees International Union. "We need to
pick out a poster child for irresponsible corporate behavior and
really expose the effect that has on the people who work for them."</TE>
<TE>   AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, a low-key consensus builder by
nature, has recently punched up his rhetoric as well. Two days before
WorldCom Ltd. filed for bankruptcy protection, Sweeney chastised
Chief Executive John Sidgmore in a three-page letter, and challenged
him to follow 10 worker-friendly principles in planning the company's
restructuring.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Sweeney will blast away at corporate tax dodgers during
an appearance at the Bridgeport, Conn., offices of Stanley Works,
which has announced plans to move its headquarters to Bermuda.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, he is set to deliver labor's biggest response yet to
the string of alleged corporate misdeeds, speaking on Wall Street and
flanked by more than 1,000 workers who lost their jobs in the
aftermath of accounting scandals.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a short-term situation," Sweeney said in an
interview. "We're going to carry this into the congressional
elections in the fall. We're going to make this a major part of our
Labor Day activities. We're not letting go."</TE>
<TE>   Drawing comparisons to the early 1930s, some analysts said the
growing disillusionment with all things corporate could offer a
psychological breakthrough for labor, which has struggled with
declining membership and a sense of fading relevance for at least 20
years.</TE>
<TE>   "Historically, the union movement and social reformers succeed
when their opponents self-destruct," said Nelson Lichtenstein, a
history professor at UC Santa Barbara and author of several books on
labor. "It's a question of when the old elites lose credibility, when
they are perceived as hypocritical or self-interested. That's when
people start looking for other institutions to fill the vacuum."</TE>
<TE>   But he said it's not clear the American public has reached that
stage. And he cautioned that unions, which represent only about 13%
of the U.S. work force, still face many obstacles, including laws
that make it difficult to organize new members, a White House that
has been openly hostile to some pet projects, and internal
bureaucracies that stifle innovation.</TE>
<TE>   Even when unions take on substantial causes in creative ways, they
might be ignored.</TE>
<TE>   "Labor in so many ways has become invisible. Even the magnitude of
this challenge doesn't change that," said Harley Shaiken, a professor
at UC Berkeley who specializes in labor and the global economy. "It's
hard for them to get their message out."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether labor has done enough amid the corporate scandals,
Karen Nussbaum, a union veteran tapped by Sweeney to head the
AFL-CIO's public response, said testily that the federation has been
deeply involved since the Enron case began, but has gotten little
credit for it.</TE>
<TE>   For example, AFL-CIO attorneys went to court for Enron workers and
won them enhanced severance packages, even though not one belonged to
a union. Then, while the loss of jobs and retirement funds was still
raw, the federation took several ex-employees on a 15-stop, pro-union
tour, hoping to build a cross-country consciousness of worker
vulnerability. It now plans a similar tour with fired WorldCom
workers.</TE>
<TE>   "I've done lots of national campaigns," said Nussbaum, who was
previously the federation's point person for women's issues.</TE>
<TE>   "After a while, you know when something is connecting. And it is
now."</TE>
<TE>   The federation also campaigned to force Enron directors off other
corporate boards, with some success. And it has stepped up the
sponsorship of shareholder resolutions that would make boards more
accountable and independent--an initiative started five years ago by
the AFL-CIO department of investor relations.</TE>
<TE>   "The immediate situation has to be addressed in terms of trying to
help these workers survive and to get some action [on corporate
governance] in Congress," Sweeney said, describing the federation's
game plan. "The longer-term plan is to continue what we're doing with
the town hall meetings, to build up some greater visibility among
unorganized workers."</TE>
<TE>   That's not enough for some longtime critics of the union
establishment, who say a historic opportunity may be squandered
unless labor gets more ambitious. "From a PR angle, maybe it's good
that everybody puts in their two cents about corporate greed," said
Richard Bensinger, a former AFL-CIO organizing director who is now an
independent union consultant.</TE>
<TE>   "On the other hand," he said, "I don't think workers need much
reminding of this. The substantive response has to be to take all
this anger toward corporations and mobilize it into something
constructive. And to do that, you have to create drama in the field
on a massive level, through organizing campaigns. Scoring points
against corporations in public relations does not make us relevant."</TE>
<TE>   Bensinger said the Enron debacle comes up frequently in house
calls to prospective union members, not only as a symbol for how
corporations have failed workers but also as a sign of how those
once-untouchable companies now appear vulnerable. That, he said, is
an important psychological leap for workers who may be inclined to
join a union but fear retribution from their bosses.</TE>
<TE>   Polling in the last decade shows that a growing majority of U.S.
workers have a favorable impression of unions, and unions have long
contended that their numbers would grow significantly if not for
hardball tactics by employers to keep them out.</TE>
<TE>   The plummeting value of many retirement funds, socked away in
company-sponsored 401(k) plans, also is giving new weight to
union-favored pension plans, which had been viewed by many younger
workers as outdated.</TE>
<TE>   "There was this sense in the '90s that we were in a new economy,
and among younger workers in particular there was a general disdain
for anything old economy," said Guy Molineux, an analyst with Peter
Hart Research Associates, which has conducted extensive polling and
focus groups for labor. "Certainly unions were grouped with an old
way of doing business. One very good outcome of this shakeout may be
a respect for things that have been around for a while."</TE>
<TE>   Several recent polls show that public opinion about corporations
has dropped since the Enron and WorldCom scandals broke. For
instance, a Gallup survey in mid-July found that 38% of respondents
considered "big business" to be a major threat to the nation's
future, compared with just 22% two years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   However, Molineux said, disillusionment with business does not
automatically confer points to labor. In fact, in the same Gallup
poll, 10% of respondents saw "big labor" as a major threat, up from
7% two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The rash of scandals creates "a very good environment for labor's
general message, and for a lot of its legislative agenda," he said.
"What's less certain is that it will help them in the realm of
organizing."</TE>
<TE>   Labor also may be hamstrung by a boardroom scandal of its own. A
federal grand jury and the Department of Labor are investigating
allegations that several union presidents improperly used their
positions on the board of Union Labor Life Insurance Corp., a
union-sponsored insurance and pension investment company, to profit
on inside information. At least three union presidents have admitted
reaping profits of up to $200,000 but say they did no wrong. Sweeney
is a member of the board but did not profit from the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "If it turns out that one of these investigations finds union
presidents profited at the expense of their own members, you may have
the largest labor scandal in years," said Ken Boehm, chairman of the
National Legal and Policy Center, a conservative group in Falls
Church, Va., that tracks union corruption. "The Sweeney quote you
keep seeing about greed in the boardroom--that could just as easily
apply to" Union Labor Life Insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the hope among labor leaders is that as the idea of market
infallibility fades, more employees will feel the need to have a
powerful institution looking out for them.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question this is a historic moment," said Bruce
Raynor, president of UNITE, the national garment workers union, which
is staging a comeback after years of hits from global trade. "Just a
very short time ago, the most admired people in our country were
CEOs. Now they are seen as people who cheated the system. The entire
perception of business has changed."</TE>
<TE>   Now, he said, labor has an opening to prove its value. "It is the
only force in society with the independence and the resources to
tackle corporate America's power," Raynor said. "We need to rise to
the occasion, and I believe we will."</TE>

<HD>War on Terrorism Highlights FBI's Computer Woes</HD>
<DH>Security: Arrogance, misplaced priorities and a culture
that 'real men don't type' kept the bureau in the slow lane. Recovery
won't come quickly.</DH>
<SE>First of two parts.</SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU and CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In the frantic days after the terrorists struck, FBI agents scrambled
to box up investigative files at their New York office a few blocks
from the World Trade Center and haul them to safety. In the FBI's
paper-driven culture, many of the documents had never even been
downloaded into the bureau's aging computer system.</LD>
<LD>   In Tampa, Fla., meanwhile, agents were scurrying to send photos of
the 19 hijackers by overnight mail to 56 FBI offices around the
country so agents could chase down possible conspirators. Frustrated
agents had been unable to e-mail the photos because the FBI's
computer system wasn't designed to handle such a basic task.</LD>
<LD>   The Sept. 11 attacks and their aftermath have exposed the FBI's
computers as a national laughingstock, a system so antiquated and
inefficient that U.S. senators quip that their kids get more bang for
their byte than the nation's vaunted G-men.</LD>
<TE>   FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III has laid out an ambitious
three-year plan for overhauling the bureau's beleaguered system. But
the severity of the problem, and its threat to national security,
have long been known to top FBI officials.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, newly disclosed records and interviews show that years of
warnings at the highest levels of the FBI often have gone unheeded
and that the bureau allegedly diverted tens of millions of dollars
from computer upgrades to manpower needs that it deemed more
important.</TE>
<TE>   Former Atty. Gen. Janet Reno became so frustrated by the FBI's
inertia that she wrote then-Director Louis J. Freeh a highly unusual
and strongly worded series of internal memos about the problem. In a
May 2000 memo obtained by The Times, titled "Threats to U.S. National
Security Interests," Reno told Freeh that it was "imperative that the
FBI immediately develop the capacity" to search its files, analyze
security threats and be able to share information with other
intelligence agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our national security requires that we get started
immediately on this effort," Reno told Freeh in a memo foreshadowing
the intelligence failures that would be revealed 16 months later by
the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Yet not much has changed, and the threat to national security
looms even greater. How the FBI reached such a state of technological
lethargy is a story of institutional arrogance, misguided priorities,
missed warning signs, overmatched technical advisors and a soured
relationship with increasingly distrustful benefactors in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Dating back nearly a decade, officials warned in private
communication and in public reports that the bureau was severely
hampered by agents' inability to do such basic tasks as thoroughly
searching case records and receiving e-mail. The shortcomings have
played a part in virtually every high-profile misstep by the FBI in
recent years, including missing Oklahoma City bombing documents, the
Robert Philip Hanssen spy scandal and the Wen Ho Lee espionage
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Investigations are still largely paper-driven, and many agents use
dinosaur-era computers or even write reports longhand in this era of
high-speed Pentium processors. The FBI has 42 databases that often
run on incompatible software and hardware. Simple searches--allowing
an agent in Minneapolis, for instance, to see whether the words
"flight training school" show up in case files--are unwieldy, if not
impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Experts inside and outside of the FBI say myriad financial,
political, technological and cultural factors explain the logjam,
among them:</TE>
<TE>   * The FBI, unable to pay the top salaries the private sector doled
out through the 1990s, lacked the in-house technical expertise to
manage complex upgrades. Until the last few years, officials often
believed, mistakenly, that their people could do the job themselves
without the help of outside experts.</TE>
<TE>   * A distrustful Congress, grown weary of huge cost overruns after
doling out $1.7 billion on FBI computer projects since 1993, has kept
the bureau on a tighter financial leash, refusing to fund new
projects until higher standards were met.</TE>
<TE>   * And, perhaps most critical, the bureau experienced cultural
resistance to letting machines take the place of solid, old-fashioned
police work, an attitude shared by many top officials and street
agents alike.</TE>
<TE>   As one veteran agent said, the FBI has been dominated by an
old-school attitude that "real men don't type. The only thing a real
agent needs is a notebook, a pen and gun, and with those three things
you can conquer the world. That was the mind-set for a long time, and
the computer revolution just passed us by because of it."</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11 Attacks Provided a 'Sense of Urgency'</TE>
<TE>   The FBI itself realized as early as 1996 that a newly installed
case-file system had glaring holes. It sent in a special "red team"
of experts and agents to analyze the problems, according to law
enforcement sources familiar with the review. Six years later, the
case system, with many of the same holes, has not yet been replaced.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials acknowledge that the Sept. 11 attacks forced them to
rethink their priorities in rebuilding their information system.
"There was always the recognition that we needed to do this. The
sense of urgency is what's different now," said Mark Tanner, the
FBI's deputy chief information officer.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller's overhaul plans--built around "paperless" files and
artificial intelligence to "predict" terrorist activity--call for a
full-speed sprint. But first, "we've got to get walking," Robert J.
Chiaradio, one of the FBI's top systems gurus, admitted in a recent
interview before leaving for the private sector. "You cannot [use
technology to fight terrorism] unless you've got the foundation. So
we're building this foundation."</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are enormous. Many believe the FBI's success or
failure, after more than a decade of fits and starts, will be a
pivotal factor in deciding the outcome of the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not think the FBI can manage its responsibilities in the
intelligence arena and the law enforcement arena, where national
security's involved, without being sure that its technology is
successfully upgraded to perform its mission," said William H.
Webster, a former director of the FBI and CIA who is widely respected
in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   CIA officials have indicated in recent closed-door testimony that
they are reluctant to share some sensitive information with the FBI
because of concerns about safeguarding the data, according to a
congressional source.</TE>
<TE>   And FBI agents in the New York field office have simply refused to
put some national security information into the system for fear it
could be compromised, according to a review in March by the Webster
Commission, appointed by the Justice Department to look into security
issues. The concerns were driven home several years ago when an FBI
college intern, given ordinary access to the system to test its
vulnerabilities, penetrated restricted files in a single afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, scrutiny of the FBI's dilapidated system has set
off a gut-wrenching exercise in "what if" scenarios: What if the FBI
had a nimble, secure, well-integrated system in place before Sept.
11?</TE>
<TE>   Could agents in Minneapolis, Phoenix and Oklahoma City, each
harboring suspicions about Middle Eastern flight students, have
pooled their resources to detect a pattern? Would the FBI, working
more quickly with the CIA, have found two of the 19
hijackers-in-training who were living quietly in San Diego after
showing up on a watch list? Would FBI analysts have been able to
decipher a spike in terrorism intelligence "chatter" to predict an
attack?</TE>
<TE>   "It just makes my jaw drop to think that on 9/11 ... the kind of
technology that is available to most schoolkids, and certainly every
small business in this country, wasn't available to the FBI," Sen.
Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who has pressed the FBI for years on the
issue, told Mueller at a recent hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the FBI overhauls its system--and does it even more quickly
than Mueller's three-year timetable--the nation risks "another
horrible attack," Schumer warned.</TE>
<TE>   Computers Were Not a Priority for Ex-Director</TE>
<TE>   Mueller admitted he was shocked to find the bureau's system in
such disarray when he took over last year, a week before Sept. 11.
"We are way behind the curve," Mueller told lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   With millions of pieces of information collected by FBI
investigators but no good way to sort it all out, officials admit
that "we don't know what we know."</TE>
<TE>   Many blame former Director Freeh for fostering an anti-computer
attitude during his tenure from 1993 through last year.</TE>
<TE>   Freeh, a dogged investigator who rose from the ranks of FBI agents
and took an active role in top-priority probes as director, eschewed
the use of computers himself. "I never saw him use one," said Robert
"Bear" Bryant, his top deputy.</TE>
<TE>   To Freeh's credit, the FBI's ranks grew significantly under his
leadership, as he gave the bureau a much-expanded international
presence. But his perceived lack of interest in the FBI's computer
woes became a growing source of frustration for Reno, according to
officials familiar with their discussions.</TE>
<TE>   "She was always pushing them to do more in that area and, sadly,
she was right," said a former high-ranking official at the Justice
Department under Reno, who asked not to be identified. "The results
just weren't there."</TE>
<TE>   Jamie Gorelick, the No. 2 official at the Justice Department in
the mid-1990s, said in an interview: "Director Freeh's priorities
were putting agents on the ground and building the [FBI's overseas]
operations. He was simply less interested in, frankly, what was the
more boring work, of infrastructure development."</TE>
<TE>   Reno became particularly incensed in 1997 when the FBI began
investigating allegations that the Chinese government had tried to
illegally buy influence in U.S. elections, several former aides said.
Congress wanted relevant documents on the issue from the Justice
Department for its own investigation, but the FBI repeatedly missed
records from its own files, aides said. At one point, CIA Director
George J. Tenet told an embarrassed Reno that his agency had found a
relevant FBI document in its own files and was turning it over to
Congress. The FBI apparently didn't even know of the document's
existence, aides to Reno said.</TE>
<TE>   Freeh declined requests for an interview. Bryant and several other
former aides said that Freeh, contrary to his critics' perceptions,
did understand the importance of upgrading the FBI's computer
capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   But, according to a former aide who supports Freeh, "it would
never be a top priority. He didn't care about it enough to devote his
own time to it" because he was so often immersed in major
investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Money Intended for Technology Was Diverted</TE>
<TE>   Publicly, Freeh spoke of the need to ramp up FBI technology. But
privately, law enforcement sources disclosed, he allowed the FBI to
raid its computer budget repeatedly, taking money intended by
Congress for systems and infrastructure upgrades and using it instead
to fund shortfalls in staffing and international offices.</TE>
<TE>   The diverted money, much of it designated for vital computer
upgrades, totaled $60 million in 2000, with millions more in other
years, according to a former senior official at the Justice
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Congress referred to the practice as "hollow" budgeting
because it allowed the FBI to artificially inflate its manpower
budget. Tensions became so great that the Bush administration, under
pressure from Congress, last fiscal year quietly cut the maximum
number of authorized agent positions by more than 400 to prevent the
bureau from diverting more computer money, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Louis Freeh wanted more cops on the beat, and he was robbing from
the equipment side to pay for people," said Rob Nabors, an FBI budget
specialist with the Republican staff of the House Appropriations
Committee. "We saw it as an end run around the appropriations
process. Legally, he didn't do anything wrong, but he was clearly
violating the will of the appropriations committees."</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials denied that they improperly diverted any money, but
they declined to discuss the issue in detail or provide a breakdown
of how computer money has been spent.</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1990s, members of Congress were fed up with the money
pit that the FBI's computer overhaul had become. The agency had
suffered two black eyes in the development of its fingerprinting and
criminal background check systems, which came in years behind
schedule and $300 million over budget, according to Justice
Department figures.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just unconscionable," according to the former senior
official.</TE>
<TE>   With in-house people running the programs, the official said, "the
bureau suffered from the mentality that an FBI agent can do anything
.... This was the great myth. The FBI has always presented itself as
the RoboCop of law enforcement, but when it came to technology, it
was always last or next to last." Even in a federal law enforcement
bureaucracy notorious for being slow to implement changes, "it was in
a race for the bottom with the INS [Immigration and Naturalization
Service]," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem, officials said, is that systems jobs were,
until recently, not seen as plum assignments. The bureau often relied
on agents with limited technical backgrounds who were at or near the
bottom of the career ladder.</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI agents want to do cases. [Top officials] have not
traditionally paid much attention to getting the best people in these
jobs," said Harvard University management professor Steven Kelman,
who oversaw federal procurement in the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated, Congress placed tight restrictions on FBI computer
funds in the late 1990s and demanded unprecedented scrutiny of how
the money would be spent. With Congress reluctant to give the green
light, the FBI shelved two plans for replacing its problem-riddled
case system, which was only a few years old.</TE>
<TE>   After the string of failures, "there was some skepticism [in
Congress] as to whether we could actually deliver a major project,"
the FBI's Tanner acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   Retired IBM Executive Changed the Culture</TE>
<TE>   A sea change came in 2000, when Freeh brought on retired IBM
executive Bob Dies to oversee technical operations. Dies is credited
with restoring the FBI's battered credibility in Congress and freeing
up tens of millions of dollars for new automation systems before
leaving the bureau this spring.</TE>
<TE>   "Bob Dies was really the beginning of an evolution in terms of
bringing substantial numbers of people in from the private sector,"
said Assistant FBI Director John Collingwood.</TE>
<TE>   But the scars from years of neglect remain, much to the
frustration of agents who believe their warnings have fallen largely
on deaf ears.</TE>
<TE>   One FBI agent complained that he didn't have access to office
e-mail to communicate with the parents of a kidnapping victim, so he
resorted to using his personal e-mail account.</TE>
<TE>   Another agent said he recently couldn't get access to PowerPoint
software to give an important presentation on weapons of mass
destruction, so he had to bootleg the software.</TE>
<TE>   And still another agent said that after the FBI finally gave him a
new laptop, he couldn't get requisition authority for a battery to
operate it.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Savage, president of the FBI Agents Assn., said agents often
waste hours trying to resolve technical glitches.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a problem we've been screaming about for years," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not getting your bang for your buck when you're paying
agents to deal with faulty automation instead of putting people in
jail."</TE>
<TE>   Savage's predecessor, Agent John Sennett, also hammered that theme
repeatedly in internal communications, warning in a 1999 bulletin
that the FBI "is stuck in the slow lane."</TE>
<TE>   But the response was minimal, and the results were often
disastrous.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, for instance, when Angel Maturino Resendiz was caught
sneaking across the New Mexico border, U.S. Border Patrol agents sent
him back to Mexico--even though the FBI had a warrant out for his
arrest in connection with three slayings in Texas and Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called railway killer went on to kill four more people in
the United States in a cross-country railroad trek of murder and rape
before his surrender.</TE>
<TE>   Although the INS bore the brunt of the criticism for allowing
Maturino Resendiz to get away, a March 2000 report by the Justice
Department inspector general concluded that the failure of the FBI
and the INS to integrate their fingerprinting systems was a critical
problem in the deadly chain of events. The two systems are still not
fully integrated.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a year later, computer troubles haunted the FBI again
with the arrest of longtime agent Hanssen, who had given the Russians
reams of secrets on his way to becoming one of the most damaging
spies in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out that Hanssen, an adept computer user, had routinely
plugged his own name and spy terms such as "dead drop" into the FBI's
computer system to determine whether the FBI was onto him.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI lacked basic computer-auditing safeguards that might have
caught such suspicious activity, helping Hanssen's espionage go
undetected for 22 years.</TE>
<TE>   And in the Oklahoma City bombing, the FBI's inability to find more
than 4,000 pages of documents and properly turn them over to Timothy
J. McVeigh's attorneys forced a delay in McVeigh's execution last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Many victims' families, who had been hoping for a sense of
finality, waited in anguish for nearly a month before the execution
was allowed to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   Again, the FBI promised reforms. But for all the major lapses the
FBI has suffered in its computer systems, critics say it shouldn't
have taken a crisis of the magnitude of Sept. 11 to light a fire
under the bureau.</TE>
<TE>   "It defies logic to think that an agency with the world at its
feet has let things deteriorate to this point," said Nabors of the
House Appropriations Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a train wreck coming, and they should have seen it
coming from a mile away."</TE>

<TE>   Computer Problems an Issue for Years</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's computer systems have been dogged by problems in recent
years. Some key events:</TE>
<TE>   1989</TE>
<TE>   The FBI experiments with developing "artificial intelligence" to
predict criminal activity, but after devoting significant resources
with minimal results, abandons the research.</TE>
<TE>   1991-1995</TE>
<TE>   The development of two major FBI systems, aimed at upgrading the
checks done on fingerprints and criminal backgrounds, suffers delays
and cost overruns.</TE>
<TE>   1995</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's automated case system, designed to replace the bureau's
paper-laden system, goes online. An internal study the next year
finds the system fraught with problems, many of which remain
unresolved today.</TE>
<TE>   1998</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's national instant check system, mandated by Congress to
verify the backgrounds of gun purchasers, goes online. The system is
criticized by both the gun lobby and gun-control activists.</TE>
<TE>   1998</TE>
<TE>   The National Infrastructure Protection Center, run by the FBI, is
created to combat cyber-crime. It improves the federal government's
computer forensic abilities but struggles to earn the respect and
cooperation of the private sector.</TE>
<TE>   1999-2000</TE>
<TE>   Congress and the FBI commit more than $86 million to overhauling
the troubled automated case system, but the money is never released
because of concerns over the FBI's history of problems with new
systems.</TE>
<TE>   1999</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's troubled fingerprinting and criminal background check
systems go online in the same month--on schedule and at a cost of
$823 million--but parts of the fingerprinting system are incompatible
with other U.S. and European systems.</TE>
<TE>   2000</TE>
<TE>   Retired IBM executive Bob Dies joins the FBI to oversee
technological upgrades and is widely credited with shoring up the
bureau's credibility with members of Congress. Dies left the agency
this spring.</TE>
<TE>   2001</TE>
<TE>   The FBI begins its third attempt to replace the automated case
system. In the wake of Sept. 11, Director Robert S. Mueller III vows
to speed up the bureau's systems overhaul with new efforts into at
data-mining and gathering artificial intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   Spring/Summer 2002</TE>
<TE>   Congressional investigators examine the role that the FBI's
systems problems may have played in the intelligence failures
surrounding Sept. 11.</TE>

<HD>House OKs Trade Authority Measure</HD>
<DH>Congress: The narrowly approved bill would give Bush
'fast-track' negotiating power with foreign nations. He says 'a
stronger hand' would benefit the economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Legislation that would significantly shift power to negotiate new
trade agreements from Congress to President Bush narrowly cleared the
House early Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Reacting to the 215-212 vote, Bush called upon the Senate to take
final action on the bill before it adjourns Friday for the month of
August.</LD>
<LD>   Bush, in his weekly radio address, said that the legislation would
give him "a stronger hand in negotiating foreign trade agreements."
The president, confronted suddenly with economic challenges that
include soaring budget deficits and a sharply declining stock market,
added: "Trade agreements create good jobs and economic growth,
because they open new markets to America's farmers and ranchers and
manufacturers. I urge the Senate to get a final bill to my desk so I
can immediately take action that will create jobs and strengthen the
economy."</LD>
<TE>   The measure would give Bush the authority through 2005 to
negotiate new international trade agreements, subject to a single yes
or no vote by Congress but without amendments.</TE>
<TE>   This expanded trade authority, held by every U.S. president from
Gerald R. Ford to Bill Clinton, expired in 1994 in the face of
congressional stalemate.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to reduce barriers to the free flow of foreign products
into the United States inevitably prove vexing for politicians of
both parties. On one hand, goods produced by lower-cost labor offer
better prices to U.S. consumers. Depending on the industry affected,
however, cheaper imports can threaten American jobs.</TE>
<TE>   This dynamic has played out anew with the trade bill. The
legislation has broad support from large agricultural interests. But
Bush has courted, with only mixed success, some members of Congress
who feared that small farmers in their districts would be hurt, as
were certain growers by the North American Free Trade Agreement of
1993.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has indicated that he would like to parlay broader
negotiating power to expand the provisions of NAFTA beyond the United
States, Canada and Mexico to every nation in the Western hemisphere,
except for Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say that without presidential "fast-track" authority
other countries would not negotiate seriously with the United States
because Congress could change any deal. The president's lack of
negotiating power has been an obstacle for Chile in particular, which
is eager to reach a trade pact with the world's largest economy. Last
spring, Chile broke off trade talks pending "fast-track" approval.</TE>
<TE>   But the test will be whether the Bush administration can overcome
the wariness that recent U.S. protectionist measures has created
among South American trading partners and whether his administration
will reduce the barriers established against Latin American producers
of orange juice, steel and other commodities. Still, the trade bill
would not appear to offer Bush much immediate relief for what besets
the national economy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important, but not in the short run," said David A. Wyss,
chief economist for Standard &amp; Poors in New York. "It gives the
president authority to negotiate treaties. Anything that comes out of
this is two or three years off."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's vote on the bill came as House members raced to adjourn
for their summer recess. One notable casualty, at least temporarily,
was a bill to make it more difficult for Americans to erase their
credit card and other debts by filing for bankruptcy. The bill,
sought for years by credit card companies but opposed by consumer
groups, may have fallen victim to the unyielding wedge of abortion
politics.</TE>
<TE>   A dispute over a provision aimed at blocking antiabortion
activists from declaring bankruptcy to avoid fines assessed for
protests at abortion clinics had stalled the legislation for months.
An apparent compromise was reached last week among House and Senate
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   But late Friday, a small contingent of antiabortion lawmakers, led
by Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R-N.J.), succeeded in delaying a floor
vote. Considering the time, the GOP leadership decided against
seeking passage before the recess, congressional aides said.</TE>
<TE>   The trade bill has been a priority for Bush, who visited Capitol
Hill on Friday to bolster GOP support in the House. To help the
measure's prospects, he had agreed to provisions aimed at assuaging
concerns of some lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation would extend from 52 to 78 weeks the period when
U.S. workers who lose their jobs as a result of trade agreements
could receive income support and retraining.</TE>
<TE>   Benefits also would be offered when a company moves a
manufacturing plant to a country that has a preferential trade
agreement with the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Some assistance with health insurance would be extended to
dislocated workers. And farmers and ranchers would be made eligible
for benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Calculations about the bill's effect were on display among
prominent Republicans:</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Lindsay O. Graham (R-S.C.), who is running for the Senate in
a state that is home to import-sensitive textile manufacturing, voted
against it. But House Ways and Means Committee Chairman William M.
Thomas (R-Bakersfield), whose district encompasses pro-export
agricultural interests, led the effort for passage.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas said that, without authority to negotiate trade accords,
"the president does not have the tool to begin negotiations with
other countries. That's like beginning a boxing match with one hand
tied behind your back."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate passed the central elements of the trade legislation in
May by a vote of 66 to 30. Despite that lopsided majority, opponents
will get another opportunity to stymie the legislation this week.</TE>
<TE>   "A multitude of delaying tactics could be employed by opponents of
the bill to slow it down or even kill the legislation," said Sen.
Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who is a proponent. "We need to get the
trade bill passed before the August recess. International trade is
key to our economic recovery."</TE>
<TE>   But another farm state senator, Democrat Byron L. Dorgan of North
Dakota, has said repeatedly that he will fight for "fair trade" that
does not victimize U.S. workers.</TE>
<TE>   Voting for the bill in the House were 190 Republicans and 25
Democrats. Voting against it were 183 Democrats, 27 Republicans and
two independents.</TE>
<TE>   Within California's 52-member House delegation, 18 Republicans
voted for the bill and 28 Democrats voted against it. Four California
Democrats were among those voting for it: Susan A. Davis of San
Diego, Calvin M. Dooley of Hanford, Jane Harman of Venice and Ellen
O. Tauscher of Alamo. Two Republicans were opposed: Duncan Hunter of
Alpine and Dana Rohrabacher of Huntington Beach.</TE>

<HD>Beyond the Glamour</HD>
<DH>The maker of a new documentary about Joan Crawford says he
set out to present a many-sided view of the mercurial star.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During a career that spanned 45 years, Joan Crawford played the role
of the glamorous movie star to perfection. Her adopted daughter
Christina Crawford, who penned the memoir "Mommie Dearest," says her
mother focused all of her attentions on being a movie star. "She
wasn't educated, but she was smart," says Crawford. "Whatever you put
your focus on is what you do well."</LD>
<LD>   The new Turner Classic Movies documentary "Joan Crawford: The
Ultimate Movie Star," premiering Thursday on the cable outlet, offers
a frank, no-holds-barred portrait of the actress. It explores a film
career that included 100 movies, as well as a personal life that
involved numerous lovers, four marriages, alcoholism and four adopted
children, of whom the two eldest--Christina and Christopher--were
abused physically and verbally by Crawford.</LD>
<LD>   Narrated by Anjelica Huston, the documentary features clips from
Crawford's movies, including her Oscar-winning turn in "Mildred
Pierce" as well as "The Women" and "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"
There are also interviews with Christina Crawford, Crawford
biographer Bob Thomas, actors Cliff Robertson and Anita Page, and
director Vincent Sherman. The documentary will be accompanied by a
41-film tribute airing Thursdays during August.</LD>
<TE>   Peter Fitzgerald, who wrote, directed and produced the 90-minute
documentary, says he set out to offer a balanced and fair portrait of
the actress, who was born into an impoverished, abusive family in
1906 and died of cancer in 1977. "I wanted to bring the whole story
to the screen, including her obsessive-compulsiveness about
cleanliness, the alcohol.... It's really important with an artist of
this caliber to include all the levels of the chessboard. I just
followed the chronological arc of her life with a little backtracking
to fill in the early childhood. During that arc, we switch between
the spiritual, emotional and physical throughout."</TE>
<TE>   Because of her beauty, says Fitzgerald, Crawford is often
underrated as an actress.</TE>
<TE>   "I think one of her great gifts as an actress was to change
herself not just for her roles, but also for the eras she was in as a
movie star," he says. "She was unique and different in so many of her
parts. We saw that she came from nowhere. Look, the camera doesn't
lie. We knew she was from the backwoods and pretended to be a movie
star, and we still loved her. It was part of her charm."</TE>
<TE>   Christina Crawford says that she can divorce her mother from the
movie star but still finds it difficult to view some of her later
films like "Harriet Craig" and "Queen Bee," in which she played
haranguing control freaks. "She was like that in the house," says
Crawford. "Her later films were fairly dark and very violent. A lot
of that was almost a direct translation of how she was in the house.
When I was growing up, those films were almost impossible to watch.
Now, with the advantage of so much time, it's almost like looking at
somebody I knew but wasn't that close to."</TE>
<TE>   Sherman, one of the top filmmakers at Warner Bros. in the 1940s
and '50s, directed both Bette Davis and Crawford. He made three films
with Crawford, including "The Damned Don't Cry," and the two also had
a turbulent three-year love affair.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved working with her," says Sherman, a dapper 96. "She knew
exactly what I was trying to get in a scene. She knew how to capture
what was the essential thing in the scene."</TE>
<TE>   Though married during his affair with Crawford, Sherman says
Crawford wanted him to marry her. "I knew that it was not for me," he
says. "I realized that big stars like Davis and Crawford had a
constant need that they were not even aware of, I'm sure, for
admiration, for congratulations, for love, for attention, for
pleasure. You need a real sophistication to survive and rise above
wanting that every day in your life."</TE>
<TE>   Both actresses, Sherman notes, were abandoned by their fathers at
a very early age. "My feeling is that a girl's first love should be
their father. When that doesn't happen, something else sets in--a
distrust of men. That was both true of Davis and Crawford. They
basically distrusted men."</TE>
<TE>   "Joan Crawford: The Ultimate Movie Star" can be seen Thursday at 5
and 8 p.m. on TCM. The network has rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable
for younger children). Also airing Thursday are the early Crawford
films "Across to Singapore" at 6:30 p.m., "The Unknown" at 9:30 p.m.
and "West Point" at 10:30 p.m.</TE>

<HD>All 9 Rescued From Mine</HD>
<DH>Success: One suffers chest pain and four others are
treated for hypothermia. After 72 hours of anxiety, a small town
rejoices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN and ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>QUECREEK, Pa.</DL>
<LD>All nine coal miners found alive Saturday were safely pulled one by
one out of a dark and flooded chamber early this morning, ending
three agonizing days of a heroic rescue effort.</LD>
<LD>   The men were lifted from a collapsed mine 240 feet underground
after rescuers carefully drilled through the ceiling of the cramped
4-foot-high chamber where they had been trapped since Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "They're all down there," yelled one mud-covered rescuer seconds
after hearing from the miners. "Every one of them."</LD>
<TE>   Just before 1 a.m. EDT today, the first miner, Randy Fogle, was
lifted in a bright yellow metal capsule, prompting exuberant whistles
and claps from workers and well-wishers. His face was covered in coal
dust, and he was drenched. Fogle, who was complaining of chest pain,
was carried out on a stretcher and airlifted to a nearby hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the miners were pulled out in 15-minute intervals and
quickly assessed by doctors. At least four were sent to hospitals,
where they were expected to be treated for hypothermia and minor
injuries. Gov. Mark Schweiker said all the men were in "pretty good
shape."</TE>
<TE>   The rescue followed a long and frustrating effort that slammed to
a halt several times. While workers bored through the earth with
massive drills, workers tried to protect the men from lethal
hypothermia by pumping heated air into the subterranean cavern.</TE>
<TE>   The miners' first words were, "There's nine men ready to get the
hell out of here. We need some chew," according to Ron Svonavec, one
of the workers.</TE>
<TE>   As engineers and rescuers wearing hard hats embraced and patted
each other on the back, the governor rushed away from the rescue site
to share the good news with the miners' families at a nearby
firehouse.</TE>
<TE>   "They are eager to come up, I'm happy and delighted to report,"
Schweiker told reporters, smiling broadly. "We're there, we just got
to bring them up."</TE>
<TE>   When the giant drill broke through the ceiling of the chamber
about 10:15 p.m. EDT Saturday, the drill operator heard five taps.
Workers shut everything down and listened for more. But all was
silent, so they lowered a microphone and headphones through the air
pipe and had a brief conversation with the miners.</TE>
<TE>   Workers then began the final stage of the rescue effort,
withdrawing the giant drill bit and then sending down the metal
capsule to lift the miners out. Awaiting the men were 10 ambulances
and 18 helicopters ready to rush them to hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   The last steps to pull the men through the 30-inch-wide unlined
shaft were still risky, but the rescuers were confident to the end.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to get them up," said John Weir, owner of Black Wolf
Coal Co. "We're going to get them in the arms of their loved ones and
we're going to win."</TE>
<TE>   The miners were trapped about 8:30 p.m. Wednesday after they
accidentally breached the wall of a flooded and abandoned mine. They
were able to warn a second crew, which escaped before the remaining
miners were hit with 50 million gallons of contaminated 55-degree
water.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Custer, one of the last miners who escaped, cracked a huge
smile when he received official word that his colleagues were alive.
"You can't imagine what I'm feeling," he said. "They're a great bunch
of guys in there."</TE>
<TE>   He sighed and said, "Ah, man, what a relief, huh? It don't get
better than this."Late Saturday night, drilling rigs towered over
what just days before was a bucolic setting where cows grazed. A
graveyard and a small church sat just up the hill from the rescue
site. Dozens of engineers, mining company workers and volunteers
worked doggedly to save the miners.</TE>
<TE>   Right up until they found the miners alive, all attention was
focused on the rig called "Rescue One," a four-story, beige drill
with an oversized bit that was on the verge of reaching the miners.
As night fell Saturday, bright lights, like those used to illuminate
a football field, shined on the drill and the workers. An American
flag waved from the top of another drill, which stood silent.</TE>
<TE>   The suspense over the fate of the trapped miners had shaken
everyone in this close-knit community, where coal mining has been a
way of life for several generations. Rescuers and volunteers
celebrated Saturday night after hearing word of their safety. In the
Sipesville firehouse, where family members held vigil for three days,
there were hugs and tears.</TE>
<TE>   "The building about fell down when they started screaming," said
Mike Brant, president of the Sipesville volunteer fire department,
who spoke to his wife at the fire hall.</TE>
<TE>   Brant, who had been working at the rescue site since Wednesday
night, said "This feels absolutely great. It's been kind of
depressing not hearing them for two days."</TE>
<TE>   No sounds had been heard from the miners since midday Thursday.
That was when there was a succession of nine taps on a metal pipe
signaling that there were nine survivors underground.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday and Saturday, the vibration and churning of the massive
drills boring through granite and limestone drowned out any other
noises.</TE>
<TE>   In the final stages of the drilling, rescuers were forced to stop
frequently, trying to avoid puncturing a potentially lifesaving
bubble of air in the chamber. Drilling halted for an hour because a
seal designed to keep air from escaping broke Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   "There is inherent danger in this rescue attempt," Schweiker said
before finding the men alive at the scene, about 55 miles southeast
of Pittsburgh. "It argues for caution."</TE>
<TE>   Rescuers used the rigs to prepare a safe passageway for any
survivors. Great care was taken to ensure that the miners would not
decompress too quickly on their way out of the chamber, which could
cause bubbles to develop in their bloodstream.</TE>
<TE>   Nine decompression chambers were brought in by the Navy to help
the miners adjust to the change in air pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said pressure inside the chamber could rise to levels
experienced by divers 40 feet underwater. The rescue effort stretched
a day and a half longer than officials had estimated.</TE>
<TE>   A broken drill bit early Friday delayed progress for 18 hours.
That bit was repaired, but then replaced again Saturday because of
more snags.</TE>
<TE>   Rescuers also began building a second escape shaft Friday in their
attempt to reach the miners. But that shaft also ran into problems
and could not reach the miners.</TE>
<TE>   During the effort, workers pumped heated air into the ground to
warm the men and drained water out to protect them.</TE>
<TE>   Engineers on the scene devised a sophisticated system to maintain
pressure in the shaft and prevent water from rushing in once the
drill pierced the chamber where the miners were trapped.</TE>
<TE>   An airlock was constructed and installed atop the rescue shaft
before the drill entered the chamber.</TE>
<TE>   The cylindrical structure had two guillotine-like doors that
opened and closed to let the drill bit out and then allow the rescue
capsule to descend.</TE>
<TE>   The nine miners rescued were Fogle, Thomas Foy, Harry Mayhugh,
John Phillippi, Ronald Hileman, John Unger, Robert Pugh, Mark
Popernack and Dennis Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Custer said they are the heroes.</TE>
<TE>   "If it hadn't been for them," he said, "there would be a bunch of
dead bodies in that mine--ours."</TE>

<HD>Rodriguez Produces Texas' Grand Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Texas Rangers are way behind in the American League West. Still,
Alex Rodriguez keeps playing as if he's in a pennant race.</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez hit a grand slam to right-center field in the 10th
inning, his second homer of the game on his 27th birthday, and the
Rangers rallied for a 10-6 victory over the Oakland Athletics on
Saturday night at Arlington, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez homered in the first inning and leads the majors with
34. Texas rallied from a four-run deficit.</LD>
<TE>   "It's my first walk-off grand slam and it feels great," Rodriguez
said. "What really feels great, it was a total team effort. A couple
of weeks ago we would have folded up the tents."</TE>
<TE>   Gabe Kapler led off the 10th with an infield single against Billy
Koch (6-2) and went to second on Michael Young's bunt. Kapler moved
to third on Frank Catalanotto's infield single and Koch hit Herbert
Perry with a pitch to load the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez said he was looking to hit a sacrifice fly, but won it
in spectacular fashion with his ninth career grand slam. He has five
multihomer games this season and 24 in his career.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't trying to do too much, just get it in the air," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Everett homered for Texas, his third in four at-bats,
including two in the seventh inning of Texas' 12-4 victory over
Oakland on Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Jermaine Dye hit a three-run homer for the A's, who lost their
fourth in a row to match a season high and fall four games behind
first-place Seattle in the AL West.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 7, New York 4--Jared Sandberg hit a two-run homer at St.
Petersburg, Fla., and the Devil Rays beat the Yankees for only the
second time in 11 tries this season.</TE>
<TE>   Travis Harper (4-6) gave up four runs and six hits in 6 2/3
innings. Toby Hall and Carl Crawford each had run-scoring triples.</TE>
<TE>   Yankee starter Jeff Weaver (7-9) struggled for the fourth
consecutive outing since being acquired from Detroit in a three-team
trade July 5. He gave up six runs and nine hits in seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   New York's AL East lead over Boston dropped to four games.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 5, Toronto 4--Corey Koskie's one-out double in the
bottom of the 10th inning lifted the Twins to their ninth victory in
10 games.</TE>
<TE>   Pinch-hitter Bobby Kielty started the rally with a single against
Kelvim Escobar (5-5) and moved to second on a bunt by Jacque Jones.
After an intentional walk to Cristian Guzman, Koskie singled to
right-center field to score Kielty.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 5, Cleveland 1--Steve Sparks won for only the second time
since May 29 and Damion Easley hit a three-run homer at Cleveland to
help the Tigers win their fifth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Sparks (5-10) gave up one run and seven hits in eight innings,
improving to 5-0 in seven starts the last two seasons against
Cleveland. It was his longest outing in 13 starts.</TE>
<TE>   Easley hit a three-run homer in the third inning against C.C.
Sabathia (6-9) and Hiram Bocachica hit a solo homer--his first in the
AL--in the fifth for the Tigers.</TE>
<TE>   Sabathia gave up four runs and nine hits in five-plus innings and
fell to 1-5 in his last nine starts. The Indians have lost nine of
11.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 9, Kansas City 1--Magglio Ordonez homered twice and Aaron
Rowand hit a two-run homer at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Graffanino also homered for the White Sox, who have outscored
the Royals, 19-3, in the first two games of the series.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Glover (4-5) gave up one run and five hits in seven innings
to win for the first time since June 27.</TE>

<HD>Boston's Burkett Finds His Groove</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Right-hander beats Baltimore, 4-0, on a
four-hitter and Red Sox trail New York by four games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>John Burkett found his rhythm. Now, his teammates hope to find
theirs, too.</LD>
<LD>   Burkett pitched a four-hitter for his first complete game this
season, lifting the Boston Red Sox to a 4-0 victory over the
Baltimore Orioles on Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Boston trails first-place New York by four games in the American
League East. The Yankees lost to Tampa Bay, 7-4.</LD>
<TE>   "It was really big," Boston Manager Grady Little said. "It meant a
lot to this ballclub and a lot to him. It came at the right time.
This is what we needed, and hopefully it'll get us going."</TE>
<TE>   Burkett (10-3), who is 10-0 against AL teams this year, matched
his season high with seven strikeouts and didn't walk a batter in his
sixth career shutout.</TE>
<TE>   He escaped a first-and-third, no-out jam in the sixth when he
induced Melvin Mora to pop up and Howie Clark to ground into a double
play. The right-hander retired the last 11 batters.</TE>
<TE>   "Control is everything for me. I always say that," Burkett said.
"If I had to draw up a game plan for the rest of the year, I would
pitch like today. I had control."</TE>
<TE>   Four of Boston's major league-leading 13 shutouts have come
against Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Lou Merloni hit a solo homer and Trot Nixon went two for three
with a triple and a double.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox broke through with two runs against Sidney Ponson

<HD>Angels Are Given Lesson of the Fall</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Anaheim is outplayed, out-thought in 3-1 loss to
Mariners, who show how to handle pennant-race pressure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>As October baseball becomes an increasingly realistic goal for the
Angels, the challenge of winning October games becomes increasingly
evident. The Angels lost a game Saturday that they could have won,
against the kind of championship-caliber team that advances into
October by winning games it could have lost.</LD>
<LD>   Jarrod Washburn pitched a complete game, and the Angels outhit
Seattle, but they nonetheless lost, 3-1. On the bases, the Angels
committed a critical blunder. At bat, they failed repeatedly to get a
clutch hit. On the bench, they were outmaneuvered by Mariner Manager
Lou Piniella.</LD>
<LD>   And so, after sharing first place with the Mariners for a day, the
Angels retreated into second place in the American League West. The
Mariners ended a five-game losing streak against the Angels but
remain plenty impressed with the upstarts from Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   "They're for real," Seattle second baseman Bret Boone said. "I
think they're exceptionally hot right now, but that said, they're a
very good team. They're not going anywhere. We'll be in a fight with
them, and that's not to discount Oakland, either. But they've got our
respect, without a doubt."</TE>
<TE>   While the Mariners might have been relieved to win, the Angels
ought to have been distressed to lose. Washburn's 12-game winning
streak, the longest in the majors this year, ended in an entirely
unpredictable fashion: He pitched his first complete game of the
season, gave up four hits and lost, for the first time since April
13. One week ago, in Anaheim, he gave up five runs and eight hits to
the Mariners, and won.</TE>
<TE>   "It's funny," he said. "It lets you know just how hard a streak
is."</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners scored on a sacrifice fly by Dan Wilson and a two-run
homer by Edgar Martinez, but the Angels got more runners on base in
the first six innings against Seattle starter Joel Pineiro than the
Mariners got in nine against Washburn. Pineiro (11-4) gave up nine
hits in 6 1/3 innings and won, because the Angels went one for eight
with men in scoring position.</TE>
<TE>   They also ran themselves out of a scoring threat in the sixth.
Brad Fullmer singled to start the inning, and Orlando Palmeiro hit a
ground ball that caromed off the glove of shortstop Carlos Guillen
for an error. Fullmer, assuming the ball had carried into center
field, rounded second base and never stopped running. But the ball
had not gone very far at all, and Guillen easily threw out Fullmer at
third.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to be able to make sure you'll be able to get to the
base," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said. "He just misread it."</TE>
<TE>   With closer Kazuhiro Sasaki warmed up, Piniella sent left-hander
Arthur Rhodes to the mound to start the ninth, with the left-handed
Palmeiro due up. As soon as pinch-hitter Benji Gil was announced,
Piniella replaced Rhodes with Sasaki, so Scioscia replaced Gil with
Jorge Fabregas.</TE>
<TE>   The result, to Piniella's glee: The Angels led off the ninth
inning with a left-handed hitter batting .195 instead of a
left-handed hitter batting .301. And Gil, batting .291, was out of
the game without taking a swing.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a good move, to force our hand," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   With the Angels trailing, 3-1, they needed a runner to reach base
before they could have a chance to tie the score. Palmeiro is a
terrific leadoff hitter--and a .400 hitter in 25 at-bats against
left-handers--so why didn't Scioscia let him face Rhodes?</TE>
<TE>   "Rhodes is a special lefty," Scioscia said. "We felt better trying
to match up Sasaki against our lefties."</TE>
<TE>   Sasaki retired Fabregas, Adam Kennedy and Scott Spiezio in order
in the ninth. The Mariners were back on top in the AL West, though
not easily, and they're well aware that they end the regular season
against the Angels, with three games at Edison Field Sept. 27-29.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be nice if we had a four- or five-game lead at that
point," Boone said, "but it could very well come down to that."</TE>

<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>When Tim Salmon stumbled at the start of the season, Manager Mike
Scioscia moved him down in the batting order, since the Angels could
not afford the luxury of letting Salmon recover his swing at a time
the offense was faltering so badly. Troy Glaus has stumbled at a time
the Angels are hitting well, so they can afford to let him swing away
at the No. 5 spot.</LD>
<LD>   Glaus stranded four runners in Saturday's 3-1 loss to the Seattle
Mariners. He is hitting .222 this month, with one home run and 23
strikeouts in 72 at-bats. As long as Glaus continues to draw his
walks and Garret Anderson does not--an indication teams respect
Glaus' power enough so that they do not repeatedly pitch around
Anderson--Scioscia does not plan to drop Glaus in the lineup for now.</LD>
<LD>   But as each game becomes more critical, Scioscia said he would
consider dropping Glaus against certain pitchers.</LD>
<TE>   "As we get into September, we might have to move some things
around to get some matchups in our favor. You don't want to stall at
that time," Scioscia said. "But Troy is a presence in the lineup.
He's still doing a lot of things, working counts and getting on base,
and it's important to have a presence behind Garret."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In 87 major league starts, Jarrod Washburn has pitched two
complete games. He has lost both, a four-hitter Saturday and a
three-hitter in a 2-0 loss in Chicago last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like I have 10 of them," he said. "Hopefully, I'll be on
the winning side of a complete game pretty soon."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lou Pote is out of options, so the Angels can't send the
disgruntled reliever to the minor leagues next season without first
allowing another team the chance to claim him on waivers. Pote asked
the Angels to do that now, after they sent him to triple-A Salt Lake
Friday, but they refused. While Pote said he did not believe he had a
future with the Angels, General Manager Bill Stoneman disagreed,
pointing to the contributions made by Brendan Donnelly, John Lackey
and Scot Shields since being promoted from Salt Lake.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, I'm concerned about winning the American League West,"
Stoneman said. "Lou Pote is an important guy to us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trade talk: The Angels do not plan to trade Scott Schoeneweis,
their only left-handed reliever, unless they can get another
left-handed reliever as part of a package. That's unlikely, with
left-handed relievers at a premium.... The Tigers scouted the
Angel-Mariner series, and Detroit has made available at least three
players who might help the Angels: closer Juan Acevedo and outfielder
Robert Fick, who carry high price tags, and outfielder Wendell Magee,
who does not.... If the Angels don't make a trade by Wednesday's
deadline, they could by the Aug. 31 deadline. Players traded in
August must first clear waivers; those traded in July need not do so.</TE>

<HD>Avengers Humbled by Storm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Avengers told themselves all last week how the playoffs are
different from the regular season. But Tampa Bay drove home the point
along with several others Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The Storm, which crawled into the Arena Football League postseason
as the 12th and last-seeded team, knocked out the fifth-seeded
Avengers with a convincing 66-41 first-round victory before 9,203 at
Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Tampa Bay (7-8), which lost, 38-24, to the Avengers during the
regular season, advanced to next week's quarterfinal game against
top-seeded San Jose, becoming the lowest-seeded team ever to advance
in the Arena playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   Quarterback Shane Stafford completed 22 of 28 passes for 298
yards, and threw seven touchdowns and one interception. When his
receivers--led by Calvin Schexnayder, who had seven catches for 64
yards and two touchdowns--weren't wide open, they were breaking
tackles. In total yardage, Tampa Bay outgained the Avengers, 329-239.</TE>
<TE>   The Storm defense gave up 245 passing yards and six touchdown
passes to Avenger quarterback Tony Graziani. But Graziani was
intercepted three times--twice in the end zone--sacked twice, and
hounded by the Storm pass rush.</TE>
<TE>   The victory also kept alive a remarkable streak. Tampa Bay is 34-0
when scoring 60 or more points.</TE>
<TE>   A season of giant strides, including the franchise's first winning
season in its three years, ended in an afternoon of missteps for the
Avengers (8-7). Along with the interceptions and sacks suffered by
the offense, the Avengers never were able to pressure the Storm
defensively. Stafford was sacked twice and lost a fumble, but mostly
he was well protected by his offensive line and had plenty of time to
throw.</TE>
<TE>   Avenger Coach Ed Hodgkiss was disappointed with the loss but did
not want his team to go into the off-season feeling like a failure.</TE>
<TE>   "This program has turned a corner," he said. "We are now a winning
franchise and we have playoff experience now."</TE>
<TE>   Offensive specialist Chris Jackson, who caught eight passes for 96
yards and three touchdowns, said the Avengers learned a painful
lesson.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a game of momentum, unlike the NFL, which is a game of
position," Jackson said. "One play can turn the entire game around.
And for us, it was an uphill battle."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In another playoff game, Andy Kelly threw seven touchdown passes
as the Dallas Desperados defeated the visiting Indiana Firebirds,
47-46.</TE>

<HD>The Hall Greets a Wizard</HD>
<DH>Ozzie Smith used a glove to throw open the door to
Cooperstown</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is uncertain whether Ozzie Smith will somersault across the
Cooperstown stage today and directly into the Hall of Fame.</LD>
<LD>   The Wizard of Oz, at 47, may not be able to generate the
acrobatics that characterized his highlight-reel performances as one
of the greatest fielding shortstops of all time and enabled him, said
Jack Clark, the Dodger hitting coach and a Smith teammate with the
St. Louis Cardinals, to "demoralize" the opposition with his glove
alone.</LD>
<LD>   "It was magical," Clark said. "You'd be in awe of something he'd
do every day. He would literally shut down rallies by himself, and
that affected other teams and the way they swung the bats. You could
see them try to hit the ball away from him, [but] there was no
offense for his defense. He was that far above everyone else."</LD>
<TE>   So, maybe there won't be a trademark back flip when the graying
Smith steps to the podium today.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe we'll have to freeze that memory in the camera of the mind.</TE>
<TE>   It is enough that Smith's induction--like Bill Mazeroski's last
year and Brooks Robinson's in 1983--serves as a Gold Glove reminder
of the importance of defense, and much more.</TE>
<TE>   It is the ultimate reminder of how far Smith traveled after
leaving Locke High in 1973, when few were doing back flips over his
athletic future, his comparatively small stature questioned by the
professional clubs that did not draft him and by the college
recruiters who did not pursue him--even though they all saw him.</TE>
<TE>   They poured into Southern California that spring. They came to see
another shortstop, a promising kid named Robin Yount, who played at
Woodland Hills Taft High and would become a first-round pick of the
Milwaukee Brewers. And they stopped at Locke to watch a first baseman
named Eddie Murray, who would be drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in
the third round, and a left-handed pitcher named Darrell Jackson, who
would play at Arizona State and later spend five years with the
Minnesota Twins.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Hinkle, then an assistant coach at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo,
made three trips to Locke to scout Jackson and try to recruit him and
each time--nudged by Phil Pote, a longtime scout who was then
teaching at Locke--came away more impressed with Smith.</TE>
<TE>   "Every scout in Southern California had to have seen Ozzie that
year, but he was the kind of player who had to grow on you," said
Hinkle, now retired and living in Atascadero after 15 years in
coaching and more than 20 as a professional scout who signed Randy
Johnson, among others. "You had to get past how small he was at the
time, but here was this little guy playing shortstop and I would say
to myself, 'Geez, this guy can play.'</TE>
<TE>   "He had great hands, great quickness with his feet, and from Day
One I knew he was definitely something special defensively. I didn't
know how much he would hit because of his size, but I knew he was
special with the glove.</TE>
<TE>   "We were a Division II school at the time and when I went back to
tell [Berdy Harr, the late Cal Poly coach whose widow, Jeanne, will
be in Cooperstown today], I said, 'Berdy, this is an acrobatic
Division I shortstop who has great body control, but don't be
surprised when you see him because he looks like a Pony Leaguer.'
Berdy said, 'What do you mean by that?' and I said, 'Well, he's only
about 5 feet 7 and 118 pounds, but he plays beyond his size.' He was
just immature physically. You hoped he'd get stronger physically, and
he did."</TE>
<TE>   Hinkle has since been credited with seeing what others didn't,
with giving Smith an opportunity others wouldn't, but he's not sure
about that, insisting Pote would have made sure Smith got a chance to
continue playing somewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "The irony is that Ozzie had already applied at Cal Poly [on an
academic scholarship], and neither Berdy nor I knew it," Hinkle said.
"He planned to walk on in the fall. I'm sure we'd have seen flashes
of how good he was, but sometimes you can get lost among 60 or so
walk-ons. As it was, he was so good as a freshman that we moved our
all-league shortstop to first base to make room for him."</TE>
<TE>   Even then, Hinkle said, Smith brought his trademark back flip, his
defensive flair, to Cal Poly, but the attribute that separated him
"is that he was the hardest worker I ever saw in more than 35 years
as a coach and scout. A lot of guys may have Hall of Fame ability,
but not Hall of Fame drive and determination. Ozzie was the benchmark
for me when it came to work ethic, focus and goals on the field. You
would literally have to chase him out of the batting cage every
night."</TE>
<TE>   It was no different after Smith was drafted by the San Diego
Padres in the fourth round in 1977, no different during a 19-year
career of 13 Gold Gloves, 2,460 hits and 580 stolen bases. Infield
practice, Smith often said, was his favorite part of the day. He
would make blind throws to first, field grounders on his knees from
the cut of the grass, have someone hit pop flies into shallow left
field so that he would have to turn his back to the plate and make
over-the-shoulder catches.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent conference call with reporters, Smith said, "Some of
it may have been instinct, but I never wanted to be surprised on the
field. I always wanted to know where I was at all times. I worked
hard. I realized ability is like beauty. It can be very, very
fleeting.</TE>
<TE>   "I also never wanted to walk away from the field feeling I had
cheated myself. I was blessed with the ability to do certain things
and never took it for granted. I gave everything I had every day and
never really stopped to admire my work. People would come up and ask
me, 'Didn't this play or that play amaze you?' and I'd say, 'No, it
was just a matter of instincts and hard work.' Of course, I've seen
some of those plays on tape since then and I have to say, 'Damn, I
was pretty good.' "</TE>
<TE>   Indeed.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question he was the best defensive shortstop in my
time," said Yount, who served as an honorary captain at the All-Star
game. "You see a lot of defensive plays now where guys slide into
balls and get up and throw where years ago you wouldn't leave your
feet to make a particular play. Ozzie redefined the position in that
way. I never saw a guy get back up and throw a baseball as quick as
he did."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the shortstops who are doing it now are also hitting 40
home runs a year and winning batting titles, and the $2.3 million
Smith received as baseball's highest salaried player in 1988 is now
less than the average salary.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope that my going into the Hall of Fame, primarily as a
defensive player, will open the door for other guys who have the
ability to win a championship," Smith said. "There will always be
room for the prototypical shortstop, although the position has
definitely changed. It's crazy and unbelievable the numbers they're
putting up now, and I love watching a guy like Derek Jeter, who has
got to have a distorted view about what baseball is all about because
he's been in the World Series just about every year he's played.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, it's fun watching what these guys can do, the numbers
they're putting up while still helping their teams defensively. It's
phenomenal."</TE>
<TE>   Smith turned himself into a respectable hitter who beat the
Dodgers with a ninth-inning home run in Game 5 of the 1985 National
League championship series with the Cardinals and finished his career
with a .262 average, up 31 points from his first four years with the
Padres.</TE>
<TE>   His Cooperstown plaque will display him in a Cardinal cap, but
there is bitterness to it.</TE>
<TE>   Although Smith retired after the 1996 season with a six-year,
$1.2-million personal services contract, he has attended only a few
Cardinal functions and never helped in spring training because of a
feud with Manager Tony La Russa, whom he has never forgiven for
making newly acquired Royce Clayton the primary shortstop in '96,
when Smith was coming off an injury-marred year in which he hit .199
and played in only 44 games.</TE>
<TE>   "I never wanted to do anything that would damage Ozzie's legend
and legacy," La Russa said on a recent visit to Los Angeles, "but I
had to do what I felt was best for the club. Ozzie had physical
questions, and I simply felt Clayton was the better player at the
time."</TE>
<TE>   Smith appeared in 82 games that final season, batting .282 and
helping the Cardinals win a division title, but it didn't ease his
discomfort, his belief La Russa deceived him regarding his status and
created the perception that he was a problem in the clubhouse. He
simply won't rejoin the organization "until you-know-who leaves, and
they understand that. I'm doing things I enjoy doing in life, and
when that regime is gone I'll be very happy to go back."</TE>
<TE>   La Russa won't be gone for a while. In the meantime, the Wizard
takes a bigger and more rewarding leap today.</TE>

<HD>Camden Provides an Answer for Iverson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shav Glick</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Allen Iverson is awaiting trial on counts of four felonies and 10
misdemeanors, but the Philadelphia 76er star is losing no support
from his fans. During a Celebrity Summer Classic softball game in
Camden, N.J., Camden Mayor Gwendolyn Faison said, "Philadelphia, if
you don't give [Iverson] enough love, come home to Camden."</LD>
<LD>   Celebrity Classic spokeswoman Novella Williams said: "I stand
committed with my other young women to free him from the powers of
evil. He is a wholesome, decent, God-fearing young man. We cannot
allow another young African-American millionaire to be taken down by
a system that can't bear to see young African-American men who are
taking care of their families. Allen, you can't lose, because God has
more power than the devil."</LD>
<LD>   Trivia time: What pitcher walked more batters, threw more wild
pitches and lost more games than anyone in the 20th century?</LD>
<TE>   The way it is: From Blackie Sherrod in the Dallas Morning News:
"The way we understand it, there's no Mrs. Shaq, but there are four
little Shaqs. Sez Mr. O'Neal: 'I'm going to be the best dad I can be
to my four kids and take care of their mothers. I'm not perfect, but
I'm responsible.' "</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Daly: John Daly can't do anything, it seems, without being
different.</TE>
<TE>   During the British Open he dislodged a piece of glass that he said
had been stuck in his hand for years. This week, playing in the Dutch
Open, he aggravated the injury after playing 11 holes in a pro-am and
couldn't stop the bleeding.</TE>
<TE>   So did he go to a doctor? No, he put Super Glue on it. His
rationale: "I don't care that it's unwise medically. I'm not going to
watch it bleed."</TE>
<TE>   Summer job: It was hot in Carlisle, Pa., where the Washington
Redskins were practicing, so some neighborhood children set up a
stand outside Dickinson College's Biddle Field to sell water, soda
and homemade cookies to spectators.</TE>
<TE>   After a couple of days, they were told to leave by security
guards.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what the big deal was, we were just sitting there,
not bothering anybody," said 9-year-old Henry Kohler. Nick Stamos,
college vice president, said it was because of liability, that the
school could be held responsible if people got sick from the food the
children were selling.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, Dickinson College announced it will help the youths sell
cookies at a site next to the college's concession stand. The cookies
will be made in the college's state-licensed kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Nolan Ryan, 2,795 walks, 277 wild pitches, 292
losses.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Tyrone Willingham, the new Notre Dame coach, told
university historian Terence Moore of the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution about his version of the definitive Notre Dame
player:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking for a tough player, but not the kind you see in the
world's toughest man competition, where they go into a barroom and
fight and those types of things. I'm looking for the young man that,
when he's between those stripes, that will take great pleasure in
knocking your head off. I mean, literally, knocking your head off.
Then, when the game's over, I'd like for him to have the toughness
and the confidence to walk off the field and say, 'Please. Thank you.
No, sir. Yes, ma'am.' "</TE>

<BD>From staff reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana of Long Beach was defeated by In-Bee Park
of Eustis, Fla., 4 and 3, Saturday in the final match of the U.S.
Girls' Junior golf championships at Echo Lake Country Club in
Westfield, N.J.</LD>
<LD>   Park, who turned 14 two weeks ago and became the second-youngest
winner, went ahead, 3-up, after nine holes. Tangtiphaiboontana had a
chance to cut the deficit to 2 up on No. 10, but she missed a
seven-foot putt. She missed a 10-footer at No. 11 and a six-footer at
No. 12, putts that could have won either hole.</LD>
<LD>   "I misread [greens] a lot," said Tangtiphaiboontana, 17, who will
be a senior at Wilson High. "Just making it to the finals ... more
than exceeded my expectations."</LD>
<TE>   Tangtiphaiboontana took some time off earlier this summer after
her parents were killed in an accident when driving her and teammate
Diane Sirisut home from the Southern Section team championships.
Tangtiphaiboontana and Sirisut suffered minor injuries.</TE>

<HD>Affluent Finds Relief on Turf</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: After three losses in a row on dirt to Azeri,
she holds on to win by a neck at Del Mar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>Looking for a way to wash that filly Azeri right out of his hair,
trainer Ron McAnally moved his filly Affluent from dirt to grass and
she came from slightly off the pace to win the $400,000 John Mabee
Ramona Handicap by a neck at Del Mar on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Azeri, the best distaffer in the country on dirt, had beaten
Affluent three times from April to June, but McAnally's filly got a
reprieve with the switch to turf for the Ramona. Azeri's next race
will be in the $300,000 Clement Hirsch Handicap on the main track on
Aug. 11 here.</LD>
<LD>   Del Mar added Mabee's name to the Ramona this year, in honor of
the late track chairman, who died in April. Saturday's card, the
fourth of the season, drew a crowd of 23,485, an increase of about
6,000 over the attendance for the first Saturday of last year's meet.
Del Mar broke its record for an opening day with an attendance of
37,439 last Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   For the 70-year-old McAnally, the Ramona was his 391st victory at
Del Mar. He heads that list, and Affluent, giving McAnally his 65th
stakes win here, moved him to within nine of the late Charlie
Whittingham on another list.</TE>
<TE>   Affluent, a 4-year-old daughter of Affirmed, had won six of 16
starts and earned $1 million going into Saturday, but the Ramona was
only her fourth grass race and the first since October of last year.
Earning $240,000 for her owner and breeder, Janis Whitham, Affluent
paid $7.80 as the third choice and she now has three wins and a
second on turf.</TE>
<TE>   Janet, who won the race last year, set slow fractions and led in
deep stretch until Affluent and Golden Apples unleashed their runs.
Golden Apples, making her first start since a throat abscess sent her
to the sidelines in April, finished second, a half-length in front of
Janet, with the favored Surya running fourth. The time for 1 1/8
miles was 1:48 1/5.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Delahoussaye, riding Affluent, registered his 90th stakes
win at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   "Grass or dirt, it doesn't matter to her," Delahoussaye said. "She
just turns it on."</TE>
<TE>   Darrell Vienna, who trains Janet, had hoped for his second stakes
win on the card. Vienna saddled Disturbingthepeace for a
three-quarter-length win over Freespool in the $169,000 Bing Crosby
Handicap, a race made easier when Irwin Molasky, co-owner of Kona
Gold, scratched the 7-5 morning-line favorite. Kona Gold, winner of
the two previous Crosbys, would have carried high weight of 124
pounds. Trainer Bruce Headley said that he would consider the Pat
O'Brien Handicap, to be run here Aug. 18, for the 8-year-old gelding.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Bobby Frankel might have been fourth with Surya in the
Ramona, but earlier Saturday he went over the $8-million mark in
purses with two wins at Saratoga and a second-place finish at
Arlington Park. Inches separated Frankel from first and second in
both of the Saratoga races.</TE>
<TE>   Crowded along the fence by Carson Hollow and jockey John Velazquez
in the $250,000 Test, Jerry Bailey shoehorned You to the wire as they
won by a nose in a victory undetectable by the naked eye. You,
handing Carson Hollow her first loss in five starts, paid $3.80 as
the favorite, running seven furlongs in 1:22 4/5.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Frankel's Tates Creek beat Voodoo Dancer by a nose in the
$500,000 Diana Handicap. Bailey also rode Tates Creek, who paid
$9.30.</TE>
<TE>   At Arlington, Falcon Flight, at 5-1, overtook Frankel's Kappa King
to win by a neck in the $225,000 Arlington Handicap. Rene Douglas
rode Falcon Flight. Kappa King, the favorite, was ridden by Pat
Valenzuela, who earlier on the card won the $100,000 Round Table with
Cowboy Stuff for trainer Donnie Von Hemel.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a change of plans, War Emblem will run in next Sunday's
$1-million Haskell Handicap after all.</TE>
<TE>   Monmouth Park announced that War Emblem, winner of the Kentucky
Derby and Preakness, would be heading for the New Jersey shore after
track officials talked Saturday with trainer Bob Baffert.</TE>
<TE>   "I got the final go-ahead from the royal family," Baffert was
quoted as saying. War Emblem, scheduled for a workout at Del Mar on
Tuesday, will be flown to New Jersey on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Prince Ahmed bin Salman, who raced War Emblem in the Thoroughbred
Corp. stable name, died last Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned about the high weight of 124 pounds that War Emblem
would have to carry in the Haskell, Baffert had said last week that
the Haskell was out and the colt would be running in the Pacific
Classic at Del Mar. The Classic, also a $1-million race, will be run
Aug. 25.</TE>
<TE>   The Thoroughbred Corp. won the Haskell last year with Point Given.</TE>
<TE>   With War Emblem running at Monmouth, a small field is likely. The
only definite ones are Magic Weisner, Puck and Like A Hero, another
California shipper.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Golan, whose owner, Lord Weinstock, died last week, scored an
emotional win at Ascot in England when he beat Nayef by a head in the
King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes. Sakhee, winless
this year and unraced since his third-place finish in the Dubai World
Cup in March, was scratched because of the hard ground at Ascot.
Kieran Fallon rode Golan, who hadn't run since a sixth-place finish
in the Japan Cup last year.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Widen the Gap</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They are two games up on injury-laden Giants in
wild-card race after 5-1 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>When calls aren't going your way, hits aren't dropping and mediocre
defensive players are robbing you with spectacular catches, players
will often rationalize such bad luck by saying, "These things usually
even out."</LD>
<LD>   Consider the Dodgers even.</LD>
<LD>   A pair of San Francisco errors, a mental gaffe by an outfielder
and a questionable call at first base contributed to the Dodgers'
first three runs Saturday, and Omar Daal breezed through an
injury-ravaged Giant lineup during a 5-1 Dodger victory before 41,314
in Pac Bell Park.</LD>
<TE>   Facing a lineup that included only three regulars--Rich Aurilia,
Jeff Kent and David Bell--and was missing slugger Barry Bonds and No.
5 hitter Reggie Sanders, Daal (8-5) gave up one run and two hits in
six innings to lead the Dodgers to their first back-to-back wins
since July 5-6 against St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Adrian Beltre followed Friday night's four-hit,
four-RBI performance with three hits, including a two-out, RBI triple
to right-center field in the eighth inning, and catcher Paul Lo Duca
had three hits, two runs and a run batted in as the Dodgers remained
four games behind first-place Arizona in the National League West and
moved two games ahead of the Giants in the wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   "We had some breaks go our way," Lo Duca said. "And we made them
pay."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were the masters of misfortune since the All-Star
break, with two blown calls contributing to losses against the
Diamondbacks on July 11 and 13, and San Diego left fielder Ron Gant
robbing Dave Roberts of a two-run triple and maybe more with an
amazing catch in a Padre victory Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   But their luck changed in San Francisco, beginning with a dizzying
array of injuries that sidelined the Giants' starting outfield, along
with hard-hitting catcher Benito Santiago, for the first two games of
the series. In addition, first baseman J.T. Snow, suffering from
flulike symptoms, did not start either game.</TE>
<TE>   Those five players have accounted for 65 of the Giants' 127 home
runs and 234 of their 476 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Daal, who got ahead of hitters with his fastball and put them away
with his curve and changeup, took advantage, pitching aggressively to
everyone except Aurilia and Kent and holding the Giants hitless until
Yorvit Torrealba's leadoff double in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot different without Bonds and Sanders in the lineup,"
Daal said. "I know everybody can hurt you, but I was just trying to
be careful with Aurilia and Kent. I didn't want anyone on base when
they were up. I didn't want to get beat by them."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants beat themselves up pretty good. After Shawn Green and
Lo Duca opened the fourth with singles, Tyler Houston hit a routine
fly ball to center. Green tagged from second, and Giant center
fielder Tom Goodwin, who has one of baseball's worst throwing arms,
threw wide of third.</TE>
<TE>   Not only was it a bad throw, it was to the wrong base. Goodwin's
decision allowed Lo Duca to tag and go to second, and that proved
costly. Green scored when third baseman Pedro Feliz bobbled Marquis
Grissom's slow chopper for an error, as Lo Duca took third.</TE>
<TE>   Cesar Izturis followed with a shot that caromed off pitcher Livan
Hernandez's foot to Feliz, who threw to first. Umpire John Hirschbeck
ruled Izturis safe on a very close play, as Lo Duca scored for a 2-0
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Torrealba doubled and scored on Goodwin's double-play grounder in
the sixth to pull San Francisco within 2-1, but Hernandez walked Daal
and Roberts with two out in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Bell made a diving stop of Mark Grudzielanek's grounder to the
second-base hole, but his throw pulled Kent off the bag at first for
an error. When Kent fell to the ground lunging for the ball, Daal
raced home for a 3-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Daal suffered a nasty cut on his right shin while sliding into
Torrealba. The left-hander had to leave the game, but the injury was
not considered serious.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre's RBI triple in the eighth made it 4-1, and Lo Duca tacked
on an insurance run with a two-out RBI single in the ninth, as the
Giants lost their third in a row to fall six games behind Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "You try to do your best out there, you try to stay positive, but
it does get hard when you keep losing games in the standings to two
teams instead of one," Aurilia said. "It's more of an uphill battle.
We don't want to dig a deeper hole for ourselves."</TE>

<HD>Karros Unhappy His Name Isn't in Lineup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>After his wife, Trish, delivered a baby boy Friday night, first
baseman Eric Karros caught a flight from Los Angeles to San Francisco
Saturday morning and made it to Pac Bell Park about two hours before
the game, only to find he wasn't in the starting lineup.</LD>
<LD>   Karros was not happy about it, and he voiced his displeasure
during a closed-door meeting with Manager Jim Tracy, who chose to
keep Tyler Houston at first and Adrian Beltre at third after both had
four hits and four runs batted in during Friday night's 11-6 win over
the Giants. Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek also had four hits.</LD>
<LD>   "It's very difficult to take the game away from a guy who had four
hits the night before," Tracy said. "Plus, I don't know how much rest
[Karros] got, and I don't want him to get hurt. He did not agree with
the decision, and that tickles me to death. I don't expect them to be
totally content with my decisions."</LD>
<TE>   Karros started last Sunday night, a day after getting hit in the
face with a Felix Rodriguez 97-mph fastball, so he couldn't
understand why Tracy would be so protective Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Four hits from three different players apparently is a little
more potent than a Felix Rodriguez fastball," Karros said. "I would
like to play. It's a San Francisco game, and I hate to miss a San
Francisco game."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy's decision probably didn't sit well with Mrs. Karros,
either. "I told the wife I gotta go play," Karros said. "When she
sees I'm not in the lineup ... "</TE>
<TE>   She'll react the same way Karros will when his name isn't in
future lineups. Tracy said Saturday that Houston will spell Karros at
first as well as Beltre at third.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he had three players--Karros, Beltre and Houston--to play
two positions, Tracy said, "Yes, we do. Tyler is not going to play
seven days week, though. There will not be a controversy over playing
time between Karros, Beltre and Houston."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left fielder Brian Jordan said the Dodgers received "a good
slashing" during a team meeting before Friday night's win, when Tracy
implored his hitters to concentrate on having better at-bats and to
work the counts more.</TE>
<TE>   The thrust of Tracy's message: Don't swing at so many first
pitches. The Dodgers had been getting themselves out too often in the
two weeks after the All-Star break, swinging at too many marginal
first offerings.</TE>
<TE>   "When was the last time you saw us get into a team's long man or
middle relief," Tracy said. "When the starter has 65 pitches in the
sixth inning, you won't see the middle relievers because you've taken
so many early swings.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not against first-pitch swinging. What I'm advocating is that
if you're going to hit that first pitch, the ball should be
blistered, unless it's a situational at-bat. To go up there with no
one on base and hit a roller to the shortstop or a tapper to the
mound, what kind of an at-bat is that?"</TE>
<TE>   One that usually comes under duress, Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>   "When guys start to press, when they're trying to be the hero,
that happens," he said.</TE>

<HD>Lewis Ready to Tackle Redskins' Rebuilding</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PRESTON</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL>CARLISLE, Pa.</DL>
<LD>The old, familiar walk is still there, the one where his head rocks
from side to side like a bobblehead doll.</LD>
<LD>   He has on a baseball cap, and the vintage plastic jacket even
though the on-field temperature is 116 degrees.</LD>
<LD>   Right before every snap, he strikes the familiar poses, either
watching with his arms folded, or bending over with his hands on his
knees. His son, Marcus, is always near.</LD>
<TE>   It must be training camp, and this must be Marvin Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Only this year, after six seasons with the Ravens, Lewis is at
Dickinson College as the defensive coordinator of the Washington
Redskins.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to see the Ravens coaches Monday before heading up here. I
wished them good luck," said Lewis, who had the league's best defense
the last two seasons. "You go to your locker, and it's certainly
different. But once you get dressed, it's the same."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis will eventually succeed with the Redskins, too. It may take
a year or two because his gap-control, pressure-oriented-style
defense requires a lot of discipline.</TE>
<TE>   But Lewis, 43, is an excellent teacher, and he continues to
improve as a coach.</TE>
<TE>   It's interesting to watch how Lewis has already begun to handle
the situation in Washington. When he first came to Baltimore from
Pittsburgh as the former Steeler linebackers coach in 1996, his
biggest problem was dealing with players.</TE>
<TE>   He trashed the system the Ravens used when they were in Cleveland,
and reminded his new team how the Steelers did things in Pittsburgh.
That's fine, if you coach in the NFC, but downright stupid when
you're coaching a former conference rival.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis hasn't rocked the boat in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "Marvin brings us a steady, well-calculated, well-proven defensive
scheme," said linebacker LaVar Arrington. "What's surprising is the
easy way he presents it. Marvin communicates well and has already
sold the veterans."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis seems to have overcome another major weakness.</TE>
<TE>   He seems at ease with the media. In Baltimore, he easily became
annoyed with reporters, and was more elusive than Marshall Faulk
during the tough times in his first two seasons. But Lewis apparently
has picked up some tips from his former boss, Mr. Camera Ready Brian
Billick (will he suffer withdrawal from not having the HBO Hard
Knocks crew around this training camp?).</TE>
<TE>   When the cameras roll, Lewis flashes that great smile. Interview
requests are never turned down. He fits right in with the other
politicians in Washington. On the field, players want to play for
Lewis because of his reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "If you date back to when he coached at Pittsburgh, just look at
what the linebacking corps did when he was there," Arrington said.
"As a whole, you see what he did when he went to Baltimore. I don't
know about the rest of these guys, but I'm not going to become the
one they say, 'Marvin Lewis is a great defensive coordinator, but
what about that defensive team he had in Washington?' "</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking to be part of that long list," Arrington said. "Look
at the Steelers when he was there, look at the Ravens, now look at
the Redskins. I don't want to be that trivia question: What defense
was not good that Marvin Lewis coached?"</TE>
<TE>   There are no questions about who is running the show in
Washington. Coach Steve Spurrier has the title, but Lewis is in basic
control. He deals with salary cap issues, draft picks and even which
field to practice on. Most of Spurrier's time is used tinkering with
his toy, the offense.</TE>
<TE>   There are striking similarities between Billick's arrival in
Baltimore and Spurrier's joining the Redskins at the end of last
season. Both had the reputation of being quarterback and offensive
gurus. Both teams already had promising defenses, but neither had
established quarterbacks. But Billick's attention to detail is so
great that it's amusing at times. Spurrier is more of a wing-it guy.
Billick scripts plays; Spurrier makes them up on the go.</TE>
<TE>   "Our relationship has been good," said Lewis of Spurrier, even
though Lewis is just as meticulous as Billick. "He has his way about
him, with the offense, the communication with quarterbacks and what
he is trying to do. Steve will come out for a practice and get a feel
for things, much like he would in a game. That's just his style."</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's Baltimore or Washington, Lewis' defense will have to
carry the team. The Redskins added Pro Bowl linebackers Jeremiah
Trotter and Jessie Armstead during the off-season to team with
Arrington, and also added defensive end Renaldo Wynn.</TE>
<TE>   Washington will try to put a lot of pressure on the quarterback
because they have great one-on-one cornerbacks in Champ Bailey and
Fred Smoot.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis likes the veteran leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's been part of the fun coming over here, is what you
don't know about the guys," Lewis said. "We have some veterans who
have worked with a number of great defensive coordinators, but they
have been open to a change. They still have that zest to win."</TE>
<TE>   The real challenges won't come until the regular season. Lewis
welcomes adversity, and knows his defense won't become great until it
faces challenges.</TE>
<TE>   That's how the Ravens became great: overcoming adversity, pursuing
like hell but also playing with discipline.</TE>
<TE>   "We got some guys who'll be on SportsCenter," Lewis said. "But we
might be on there for winning six games, or we could be on there a
lot because we're a very, very good football team. They have to make
that decision.</TE>
<TE>   "The success we had in Baltimore came from the fact that we had a
great leader in Ray (middle linebacker Ray Lewis) who kept us
together when times were tough. There wasn't anything we hadn't seen
before."</TE>
<TE>   They'll get it together.</TE>
<TE>   And within a year or two, the Redskins will have one of the better
defenses in the league. And then maybe, just maybe, league owners
will hire Lewis as a head coach.</TE>
<TE>   There won't be anything else left for him to prove.</TE>

<HD>This Summer Is Marking Another Great Sports Era</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE WILSTEIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lance Armstrong. Tiger Woods. Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.
Serena and Venus Williams.</LD>
<LD>   Their biggest rivals are in the record books, in other summers of
blockbuster performances, other golden ages of sport.</LD>
<LD>   Armstrong will roll down the Champs Elysees with a yellow jersey
today, his fourth consecutive Tour de France triumph a virtual
certainty. Who's left to catch in this 99-year-old race? Only Spain's
Miguel Indurain, winner of five in a row from 1991-95.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not my last Tour de France," Armstrong says.</TE>
<TE>   One wild rain-soaked round in the British Open wrecked Woods'
single-season Grand Slam quest but didn't dent his overall dominance
of golf. He's won seven out of the last 12 majors, eight overall. His
eyes aren't on Ernie Els or Phil Mickelson. They're on Jack Nicklaus'
18 majors.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal and Bryant led the Lakers to a sweep of the New Jersey Nets
and a third consecutive NBA title in June. If that didn't quite put
these Lakers on a par with Michael Jordan's Bulls or the "Showtime"
Lakers of the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson era, a fourth
title surely would.</TE>
<TE>   The Williams sisters may be just starting a long run at the top of
women's tennis. The most dominant siblings in sports history, they've
played each other in three of the last four Grand Slam finals. Venus
won the U.S. Open last fall, Serena took the French and Wimbledon
titles this summer to grab the No. 1 spot. The challenge now is keep
it up against each other and find their place among or ahead of the
all-time greats in the game.</TE>
<TE>   A golden age in sport is a shifting concept rather than a fixed
time. Maybe it's the time of everyone's childhood. Back in the 1920s,
the giants were Babe Ruth, Jack Dempsey, Red Grange, Bobby Jones and
Bill Tilden. Today's athletes are no less remarkable, no less
fascinating.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, a decade ago, even amid the soaring profits and popularity
that sports enjoyed then, there were warnings of doom.</TE>
<TE>   "I think spectator sports are going away," John Naisbitt, the
futurist and author of two "Megatrends" best sellers, predicted.
"Sports are being replaced by the fine arts as the dominant leisure
activity of the society."</TE>
<TE>   Hardly.</TE>
<TE>   But Naisbitt wasn't alone in his pessimism. There were worries
among agents, TV advertising executives, team auditors, sports
marketers and corporate sponsors that spectator sports would face
serious challenges over the next decade. Among the chief concerns:</TE>
<TE>   *  Apathy caused by cultural or economic changes would lead to a
big turnoff of sports.</TE>
<TE>   *  Pay-per-view would destroy the fan base.</TE>
<TE>   *  Soaring salaries and lower TV ratings, tugging sports in
opposite directions, would leave the pro leagues stretched thin and
reduce the values of franchises.</TE>
<TE>   *  Golf, tennis and other individual sports would suffer as
sponsors backed out.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, even after the 1994 baseball strike and with the prospect
of another looming, the opposite is true. Sports are bigger than ever
and there are more good athletes than ever. Woods energized golf, the
Williams sisters tennis, O'Neal and Bryant the NBA. Barry Bonds' 73
homers last year broke the seemingly untouchable record of 70 set by
Mark McGwire only three years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   And most amazing of all has been Lance Armstrong.</TE>
<TE>   The 30-year-old Armstrong has captured the public's admiration and
affection as few athletes ever have. He is the personification of
hope, a cancer survivor who overcame operations and chemotherapy,
wrote about them frankly and pushed himself relentlessly to dominate
one of the world's most grueling events.</TE>
<TE>   The Tour de France is a perilous, three-week struggle over more
than 2,000 miles.</TE>
<TE>   It's filled with hairpin turns, lung-searing climbs in the Alps
and Pyrenees, rain and wind, and slick roads with a couple hundred
riders jostling for position.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong took nothing for granted, but let nothing get in his
way. The U.S. Postal Service, which sponsors him, couldn't have had a
better representative. No matter the weather or the circumstances, he
delivered.</TE>

<HD>Webb Became Tangled in Run to Greatness</HD>
<DH>Track: High school miler dropped out of Michigan and will
turn pro after a freshman season of turmoil.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF PASSAN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Alan Webb, the Mount San Antonio College Relays last April had
the potential to be a noteworthy day. Webb had returned from the
nagging Achilles' tendinitis that kept him out of indoor competition
at the University of Michigan and even talked about running a blazing
3 minute 38 seconds in the 1,500-meter race.</LD>
<LD>   Instead Webb, who became a national celebrity after running a
schoolboy-record 3:53.43 mile as a senior at South Lakes High School
in Reston, Va., finished ninth in 3:44.74. His teammates and coaches
at Michigan called the meet the peak of Webb's frustration in a year
marked by injury and disappointment.</LD>
<LD>   Two months later, Webb left Michigan and turned professional.</LD>
<TE>   Webb, 19, has declined to comment about his year at Michigan or
his decision to turn professional. But teammates and coaches say that
as Webb's year at Michigan wore on, the freshman withdrew from
teammates, found solace in the words of his high school coach and
left Ann Arbor with a combination of frustration, homesickness and
burnout.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked at his 3:53 and said, 'I'm already the fastest guy in
the NCAA,' " said author Chris Lear, who shadowed the Michigan track
team from January to June for a book. "He was looking for that
coronation so he could say, 'I'm ready for the next level.' I don't
think anyone expected him to struggle like he did."</TE>
<TE>   Webb started his college career facing high expectations, and they
stayed high throughout the fall. Shortly after arriving in Ann Arbor,
Webb and the team were whisked to camp in Glen Arbor, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   There, five hours from campus, the Wolverine runners got their
first look at Webb: his upper body, strong and toned; his face,
frozen in determination; and his legs kicking at an otherworldly
pace.</TE>
<TE>   "He was leading the workouts," said Ron Warhurst, Michigan's coach
for 28 years. "Every one of them. ... He was more advanced than any
other freshman I'd had in my career. He was even more advanced than
anyone on the team," including all-American seniors Mike Wisniewski
and Mark Pilja.</TE>
<TE>   "Your gut reaction is to be in awe of the fact that you're running
with someone who's famous," Pilja said. "It's like a basketball
player finding out Michael Jordan is coming to your team. He just
became one of the guys right away. You wouldn't know he was Alan
Webb, the high school star."</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 14, Michigan charged $4 to watch its lone home meet--the
first time the school charged for a cross-country meet. Webb won. He
then blew away the field at the Big Ten championships, placed second
in the Great Lakes regional meet and 11th at the NCAA meet, good
enough to earn all-American honors.</TE>
<TE>   Webb wasn't the best in the nation, but he was close, and being a
bridesmaid in his second sport, cross-country, sat well with him,
teammate Tom Greenless said.</TE>
<TE>   But Webb's successful fall turned into a frustrating winter
because of an injury he suffered while training for indoor track
season on Dec. 15.</TE>
<TE>   As he ran hills in Ann Arbor, his right foot landed strangely. He
had injured his Achilles' tendon. Give it a couple weeks, Warhurst
told him, and you'll be fine.</TE>
<TE>   But the tendinitis lingered. Webb's desire to run grew. A month
went by, then six weeks. Eventually, Webb decided to redshirt the
indoor season.</TE>
<TE>   "There was some separation from the team" after the injury, Stanko
said. "He totally worried about himself. Didn't worry about the team.
He would go off and do his own thing. During the fall, he loved being
around the guys. He was really having a great time. That was
reinforced because he was running well."</TE>
<TE>   After the season, Webb said he fought homesickness all year.
Others say more was bothering him.</TE>
<TE>   Warhurst also said another struggle developed in the spring--one
between him and Scott Raczko, Webb's high school coach. Raczko would
call Webb's dorm room two to three times a week, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Warhurst said he felt his authority being undermined.</TE>
<TE>   The two coaches said they agreed that they would wean Webb off
Raczko.</TE>
<TE>   But by April, Warhurst, 58, felt the plan wasn't working. Raczko
was still the coach who led Webb to the 3:53, and because of that and
perhaps his age (30), he was a more natural confidant. By late April,
Warhurst felt he had to issue an ultimatum.</TE>
<TE>   "I said to him, 'If you think your high school coach can coach you
better than I can, we're wasting our time,' " Warhurst said.</TE>
<TE>   Webb's performances were improving--on May 10, he ran the 1,500 in
3:41.46 to qualify for the NCAA meet. He won the Big Ten 1,500 on May
19. He would win all-American honors after the season.</TE>
<TE>   But two days before the NCAA 1,500 final, USA Today published a
story that talked about Webb turning professional. "I'm not thinking
about it that much," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His teammates and coaches were furious to learn that Webb was
thinking about it, even a little bit. Warhurst said he believes some
of the conversations between Raczko and Webb involved turning
professional.</TE>
<TE>   "It's totally untrue," Raczko said. "The reality is, Alan wanted
to explore the professional thing."</TE>
<TE>   Warhurst remains skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "I would've felt bad if I lost the kid because I couldn't coach
him or we couldn't get along," he said. "But knowing there was the
outside influence, I was in a no-win situation."</TE>
<TE>   Webb drove home from Ann Arbor in early June. Ray Flynn, an agent
who represents several professional track and field athletes, met
with Webb and his family in Reston on June 13. Three days later, Webb
signed with Flynn. Raczko detailed the plan: turn professional, leave
Michigan, pick up classes at George Mason University and work toward
becoming the best miler in the world.</TE>
<TE>   The question lingers whether Webb is ready to race professionally.
Tentative plans have him training this fall and winter and then
competing on the professional circuit in Europe, Raczko said.</TE>
<TE>   "These aren't high school or college kids," Warhurst said. "These
are men earning a living. They're not going to be intimidated by a
19-year-old who ran 3:53."</TE>

<HD>Ruiz Watch Rises to 16 in Galaxy Win</HD>
<DH>Soccer: His two goals in 2-1 victory over Crew earn him a
Rolex from Lalas and goal-scoring lead in MLS.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID CARRILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alexi Lalas, get ready to hand Carlos Ruiz the watch you owe him.
Make that two.</LD>
<LD>   And get him a better undershirt.</LD>
<LD>   Ruiz, 22, scored two goals for the Galaxy and possibly earned two
watches in a 2-1 victory over the Columbus Crew in front of 14,177 at
the Rose Bowl on Saturday night.</LD>
<TE>   Lalas promised Ruiz a watch before the season if the rookie scored
15 goals.</TE>
<TE>   He scored Nos. 15 and 16 against the Crew. The last one made sure
that Lalas will deliver a Rolex-style watch to Ruiz at the end of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz scored the game-winner off a volley in the 75th minute to
extend the Galaxy's unbeaten streak to four (3-0-1).</TE>
<TE>   After Ruiz scored his second goal, which gave him the MLS lead
ahead of New England's Taylor Twellman, he slipped out of his Galaxy
jersey and showcased a sleeveless T-shirt.</TE>
<TE>   The front read in Spanish "Te amo Guate" (I love you Guatemala)
and the back "Gracias Guatemala por tu apoyo" (Thank you Guatemala
for your support).</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's deserving of a Rolex now," Lalas said after Ruiz
recorded his fifth multi-goal game. "But I also think he needs a
nicer shirt to wear underneath.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to have style when you score world-class shots like
that. The last goal deserves a possible second watch."</TE>
<TE>   Forward Alejandro Moreno, making his third start, set up the
game-winner for the Galaxy (9-7-3) on a crisp pass just outside the
penalty box. He found a wide-open Ruiz deep inside the box and the
striker didn't let the ball hit the grass.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz's right foot sent the ball into the upper left corner of the
net, leaving Columbus goalkeeper Jon Busch no chance for a save. The
victory kept the Galaxy in third place in the Western Conference with
30 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't understand how wide open I was there," Ruiz said. "I
don't think they knew what I could do on the field because there were
only a few times that someone was near me."</TE>
<TE>   And when they were nearby, they couldn't stop Ruiz. Midfielder
Cobi Jones found two Crew (7-9-4) defenders gambling early in the
first half. Jones delivered a through ball from the left to a
streaking Ruiz as he split Mike Clark and Brian Dunseth inside the
penalty box.</TE>
<TE>   It appeared the Crew was trying for an offside trap because the
defenders moved forward when Ruiz touched the ball.</TE>
<TE>   The plan didn't work.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz gained control as soon as the defenders hesitated. He
dribbled once and tapped a right-footed shot from 12 yards away past
Busch to give the Galaxy a 1-0 lead in the ninth minute.</TE>
<TE>   "He should be considered for MVP," Columbus Coach Greg Andrulis
said of Ruiz, who will be an All-Star game starter Saturday at RFK
Stadium in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "He's unbelievable and he plays with much passion. He deserves
whatever he gets."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Gamez, winless since taking two events in 1990 in his first
two months on the PGA Tour, shot a five-under-par 66 Saturday for a
share of the third-round lead in the John Deere Classic at Silvis,
Ill.</LD>
<LD>   J.P. Hayes, the second-round co-leader after a course-record 61,
had a 67 to match Gamez at 18-under 195 on the TPC at Deere Run.</LD>
<LD>   The start of the round was delayed nearly five hours because of a
morning thunderstorm. Because of the wet conditions, players were
allowed to lift, clean and place in the fairways.</LD>
<TE>   Mike Heinen, who opened with a 63 to top the field after the first
round, was three strokes back at 15 under after a 66.</TE>
<TE>   Gamez, who won the 1990 Tucson Open in his first official tour
start, birdied the par-five 10th to grab a share of the lead with
Hayes and Heinen, then took the lead with a birdie at the 11th. Gamez
added birdies on Nos. 14, 17 and 18 to reach 18 under.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gloria Park matched the tournament record with an eight-under-par
63, but all that did was tie her for the lead with Annika Sorenstam,
who had a 64, after three rounds of the LPGA Big Apple Classic at New
Rochelle, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Park, in her third season on tour, matched Betsy King's 63 from
1990, but that was when the 6,161-yard Wykagyl Country Club course
played to par 72. Since it was changed to par 71 the next year,
Park's round was the lowest.</TE>
<TE>   Park had five of her eight birdies on the back nine, including
three over the final four holes. Park has one career victory, five
fewer than Sorenstam has in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   The world's No. 1 woman player started the round one stroke in
front of Park and three behind second-round leader Kelli Kuehne, who
had a 73 and is six shots back.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bob Gilder extended his streak to 47 holes without a bogey and
kept his one-stroke lead after two rounds of the FleetBoston Classic
at Concord, Mass., despite a late surge by Jim Thorpe.</TE>
<TE>   Gilder shot five-under 67 and was at 11-under 133 in his bid to
become the first golfer to win consecutive senior tournaments since
Thorpe did it last year. Thorpe birdied four of the last five holes
and was at 10 under. Ted Goin and Dave Eichelberger were another
stroke behind.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Palmer had the only eagle Friday and produced the first
eagle Saturday, holing a 95-yard wedge on the 526-yard fifth hole.
His rounds of 75 and 74 are his lowest this year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tom Watson shot a five-over-par 76 in windy conditions and slipped
to fourth place after three rounds of the Senior British Open at
Newcastle, Northern Ireland. The five-time British Open champion was
eight strokes behind leader Noboru Sugai of Japan, who overcame
40-mph wind gusts and two double bogeys to shoot a two-over 73.
Sugai, at six-under 207, was the only player under par.... Germany's
Tobias Dier eagled the final hole for a three-under 67 and a
three-stroke lead after three rounds of the $1.8-million Dutch Open
at Hilversum, Netherlands.</TE>

<LD>There is a possibility late this afternoon that the same horse or
jockey will have won the $400,000 Eddie Read Handicap for a second
year in a row.</LD>
<LD>   What is certain is that the two won't be winning the Grade I
together.</LD>
<LD>   Redattore, the defending champion, will try to take the Read,
which is run at 1 1/8 miles on the turf, from the rail as the 5-1
third choice in the field. The Read will be the eighth race on a card
that will feature a pick-six carryover of $211,777.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Alex Solis, who was Redattore's rider when he won the
race at 5-2 in 2001, will be aboard 3-5 favorite Beat Hollow.</TE>
<TE>   The reigning turf king in the United States, Beat Hollow, who is
owned by Juddmonte Farms and trained by Bobby Frankel, has won two
Grade I's in a row in different states.</TE>
<TE>   Not long before War Emblem's shocker in the Kentucky Derby, the
5-year-old Sadler's Wells horse won the Woodford Reserve at Churchill
Downs on May 4, then, on the day War Emblem's Triple Crown dreams
were shattered, he went wire-to-wire in the Manhattan Handicap at
Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   A winner of six of eight, Beat Hollow will get most of the
attention in the Read, but lurking among his opponents is the only
horse to have beaten him in this country.</TE>
<TE>   Sarafan, who defeated Beat Hollow by a neck in the Explosive Bid
Handicap at the Fair Grounds in Louisiana on March 24, will try to
remain unbeaten on the Del Mar turf. He won the restricted Harry F.
Brubaker at 1 1/16 miles last Aug. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Atelier will try to give trainer Shug McGaughey
his seventh win in the last 15 years in the $250,000 Go For Wand
Stakes at Saratoga. Her opponents in the Grade I include Miss Linda,
Forest Secrets, Dancethrudawn, Too Scarlet, With Ability and
Transcendental.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: A certain pick six player or players. There was one
correct ticket Friday worth $380,775. Whoever had it, deserved it, as
the winners included Humorous Lady ($82.20).</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: The field in today's eighth at Santa Rosa. The 13
original entrants in the $8,000 maiden claimer are a combined 0 for
104.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A trifecta in the fourth keying Magnificent
Max on top with Grand Visions, Burning Bay and Pikester in the two
hole and all in the third spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 0/5. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $0/$37.40. Total money bet: $70.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Trainer Danny Cardoza will be looking for repeat wins from a pair of
his horses tonight.</LD>
<LD>   In the seventh, Cardoza, who is winning with about one of every
three horses he has started at the meet, will send out One Cool
Alibi, who broke her maiden in her second start on July 13.</LD>
<LD>   Then, a race later, the Brazilian-bred Dinastia Toll will try for
her second win in three starts when she takes on five others in a
$12,550 allowance at 350 yards.</LD>
<TE>   A 2-year-old daughter of Sir Alibi, One Cool Alibi is one of three
fillies in the seventh, which will go at 300 yards, coming off a win.
Sawachan beat maidens by a length on July 5 for trainer Kelly Lewis.
Runaway Royal edged Whats Your Game by a nose on July 6 for trainer
Felix Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Dinastia Toll, who is a 4-year-old Tolltac mare, has WCR Rubys
Diamond to fear most in the eighth. An Idaho-bred mare trained by
Donna McArthur, WCR Rubys Diamond was a sharp second to the streaking
Running Bac in last weekend's Deelish Handicap in her first start of
the year.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Seldom Lies. 2. Truly Tia. 3. Silky Goose. 4.
Movnit. 5. Reality Check. 6. Run Five Dashes. 7. Sawachan. 8. WCR
Rubys Diamond. 9. Heza Buggin Wonder.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Seldom Lies and Halloween Moon in the first, Truly Tia,
Tierra Firme and Sunday Blush in the second, Silky Goose and Fahana
in the third and Landseaire and Movnit in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Fahana could benefit from a rapid pace in the
third. First Steps Special could improve against softer company in
the seventh after chasing Red Lipstick in a trial for the Ed Burke
Memorial Futurity.</TE>
<TE>   Post time: 5:30 p.m.</TE>

<LD>Morning Snow is two-thirds of the way to a $1-million bonus after
scoring an easy win in the $436,000 Ed Burke Memorial Futurity on
Saturday night at Los Alamitos.</LD>
<LD>   More than two months after her victory in the Kindergarten, the
2-year-old This Snow Is Royal filly and 5-1 second choice came out
strongly from the inside post under jockey Sam Thompson and went on
to win by about two lengths in a rapid 17.35 seconds for the 350
yards.</LD>
<LD>   In winning for the fifth time in six starts for owners Charles and
Dixie Patterson and trainer Donna McArthur, Morning Snow had her task
made easier when heavily-favored Straw Flying Dash was eliminated at
the break.</LD>
<TE>   The fastest qualifier for the Burke and perfect in his first three
races for owners Micah Leslie and Link Newcomb, Straw Flying Dash
hopped in the air at the start under jockey Joe Badilla, Jr.,
effectively ending his chances.</TE>
<TE>   With her victory, Morning Snow became the first horse to sweep the
first two legs of the Los Alamitos Bonanza. If she wins the Los
Alamitos Million on Dec. 13, she will earn a $1 million bonus.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty easy," Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   "She just pulled me the last part of the race. I knew we were
going fast, but not that fast."</TE>
<TE>   Special Queen SA paid $17 to place and another longshot,
Dashnlitia, was third.</TE>

<HD>Sanchez Brightens His Future With Red Sox</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rising through the ranks as a shortstop in the Boston Red Sox
organization can be a tricky proposition.</LD>
<LD>   Just ask David Eckstein, who was put on waivers by the club in
June 2000 despite hitting over .300 in each of his first three minor
league seasons. Eckstein has since proven his ample worth with the
Angels.</LD>
<LD>   Now comes Freddy Sanchez, a Hollywood native who recently put
together a 27-game hitting streak and a stretch of 45 consecutive
games in which he reached base safely. The 24-year-old prospect hit
.328 at double-A Trenton--eight points higher than his career average
before the season--before earning a promotion to triple-A Pawtucket a
few weeks ago.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike Eckstein, though, Sanchez appears to be part of Boston's
future plans. With perpetual All-Star Nomar Garciaparra entrenched at
shortstop, Sanchez has started splitting time between shortstop and
second base. Red Sox second baseman Rey Sanchez will be a free agent
after the season, though club officials stress they are in no hurry
to promote Freddy Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   "From an athletic standpoint, [Freddy Sanchez] has everything he
needs to play second base," said Ben Cherington, assistant director
of player development with the Red Sox. "Because of that, it's going
to be easier for him to make that adjustment down the road if he has
to."</TE>
<TE>   Said Sanchez: "It doesn't matter where I play. The main goal is to
get to the big-league level."</TE>
<TE>   If the 5-foot-11, 185-pounder keeps putting up the kind of numbers
he did during his 45-game on-base streak, it might not take him long
to get there. He hit .352 over that stretch with 62 hits, 29 walks
and 38 runs.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez said it was no coincidence that his 27-game hitting streak
started the same day he had a lengthy conversation with Doug Gardner,
a sports psychologist with the Red Sox. Sanchez, who describes
himself as an intense player, said the meeting calmed him down, made
him more patient and helped him realize that there was no reason to
stew over situations such as hitting a line-drive out.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd ground out and I'd get upset," Sanchez said of his previous
mentality. "[Gardner] made me realize I didn't want to do that
anymore. This is a game I play for fun."</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez already has many admirers in baseball circles, Eckstein
among them.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen the numbers he's put up year in and year out, which are
fantastic," Eckstein said. "If he keeps doing that, they'll give him
the opportunity [to play at the major league level]."</TE>
<TE>   * Edmonton right-hander Scott Randall was attempting to tie the
Pacific Coast League record of 10 consecutive victories Saturday
night when the Trappers played at Tacoma. Randall, a graduate of
Goleta Dos Pueblos High, won his ninth consecutive decision for
Edmonton--and 11th overall--Monday when he registered a complete-game
victory against New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   The 26-year-old started the season with New Britain of the
double-A Eastern League, where he went 2-0 with a 3.48 earned-run
average in five starts. He is 9-0 with a 3.60 ERA in 14 appearances
at Edmonton.</TE>
<TE>   Originally selected by Colorado in the 11th round of the 1995
draft, Randall was 59-54 with a 3.96 ERA in seven minor league
seasons heading into this year.</TE>
<TE>   Angels' System</TE>
<TE>   It has been a rough couple of weeks for the Angels' recent top
draft picks. Right-hander Joe Torres, the club's top pick in 2000,
has given up 17 runs--14 earned--over 17 innings in his last four
starts for Class-A Cedar Rapids, giving him a 7.41 ERA over that
span.</TE>
<TE>   Teammate Casey Kotchman, the Angels' top prospect and their first
pick in 2001, is out for the season after injuring his left wrist
July 3 while sliding. The first baseman had the wrist put in a cast
July 19 after being examined by a specialist in Los Angeles. He was
hitting .292 with four home runs and 42 RBIs at the time of the
injury.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Saunders, the club's top pick in this year's draft, has
compiled a 5.12 ERA in 19 1/3 innings with rookie-league Provo.</TE>
<TE>   * Bobby Jenks pitched his finest outing as a Rancho Cucamonga
Quake on July 18 when he struck out 13 during a 2-0 shutout against
the High Desert Mavericks. Jenks (2-3, 3.83 ERA), who had a no-hitter
for 5 1/3 innings and threw one pitch in the ninth inning clocked at
100 mph, gave up two hits and three walks.</TE>
<TE>   * Salt Lake right-hander Chris Bootcheck was hammered in his first
two starts after being promoted from double-A Arkansas, giving up 10
runs--all earned--in 11 innings for an 8.18 ERA. Bootcheck was 8-7
with a 4.81 ERA for Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   * Salt Lake, clinging to first place in the Central Division of
the Pacific Coast League, could drop out of the lead this week if it
continues its woes on the road against Iowa. The Stingers have lost
11 consecutive games in Des Moines, where they open a four-game
series Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   * Someone on the Cedar Rapids media relations staff has a little
too much time on his hands. A Kernel official has determined that the
team is 25-6 when Dana St. Germain, the club's director of
entertainment, spray paints home plate before games.</TE>
<TE>   Dodgers' System</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas catcher Dave Ross became the third player in the minors
this season to log consecutive two-home run games, July 16-17 against
Fresno. After hitting two home runs with three RBIs in the 51s' 7-5
victory July 16, Ross belted a two-run homer and a three-run homer in
a 7-2 win the following day, ending a stretch in which he hit six
home runs in five games. Ross is hitting .278 with 12 home runs and
42 RBIs this season.</TE>
<TE>   * Pitchers Ruddy Lugo and Heath Totten were promoted to double-A
Jacksonville on Sunday after excelling for Class-A Vero Beach. Lugo
ranked second in the Florida State League with a 2.38 ERA, and his
8-2 record was the best on the team. Totten ranked third in the
league with nine wins.</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Brian Pilkington, the Dodgers' top pick in the 2001 draft,
moved up from South Georgia to fill one of the spots. Pilkington,
nephew of former major league pitcher Bert Blyleven, was 8-4 with a
3.45 ERA and 73 strikeouts in 112 innings for South Georgia. The
Garden Grove Santiago High graduate walked only 13 batters.</TE>
<TE>   * Dodger pitcher Odalis Perez hasn't been the only pleasant
surprise of the trade that sent Gary Sheffield to the Atlanta Braves
and brought Perez and Brian Jordan to Los Angeles. Andrew Brown, a
21-year-old right-hander for Vero Beach, pitched a one-hitter in a
3-0 victory over Brevard County in his last outing to improve to 7-9
with a respectable 3.67 ERA. Brown gave up only a third-inning double
and three walks, hit a batter and struck out a career-high 10.</TE>
<TE>   California League</TE>
<TE>   Josh Hamilton had hoped this would be the season he put all his
injuries behind him and showed the Tampa Bay Devil Rays that they had
made a wise decision by selecting him first overall in the 1999
draft.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Hamilton is back in a familiar place--on the disabled
list.</TE>
<TE>   The highly touted Bakersfield outfielder tore the rotator cuff in
his left shoulder earlier this month and is out for the season.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton, who had already endured three stints on the disabled
list this season, has battled injuries since his first full
professional season.</TE>
<TE>   The left-handed hitter was batting .303 with nine home runs and 44
RBIs in 56 games this season, primarily as a designated hitter,
before his latest injury.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton's saga started in 2000 when, as a member of Class-A
Charleston, a right knee injury required arthroscopic surgery 96
games into the season. A car accident, coupled with back and leg
injuries, limited Hamilton to 100 at-bats in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   This season, a sore shoulder, a lower back strain and rib cage
injuries had kept him sidelined before the torn rotator cuff.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Hamilton was named to the league's All-Star team and
had remained hopeful of a promotion before his latest setback.</TE>
<TE>   Now he can only look forward to spring training 2003.</TE>
<TE>   * League attendance is 9% ahead of last year's pace, as all 10
clubs reported increases through June 30. San Bernardino, the South
Division's first-half champion, reported a league-high 38% increase
and is averaging 2,886 fans a game. Rancho Cucamonga continues to
lead the league, averaging 4,020.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Austin Cameron of El Cajon held off Eric Norris of Dana Point to win
the NASCAR Winston West series feature, the Jani-King 200, Saturday
night at Irwindale Speedway. The crowd of 6,500 was the second
sellout of the season.</LD>
<LD>   The race came down to the final 12 laps of the race, when Norris,
who had fallen as far back as 10th, took four tires during a caution
flag. Norris then moved up to the top five, and closed to within a
tenth of a second of Cameron, but he could not catch him.</LD>
<LD>   "The crew told me that he [Norris] had fresh tires, and they told
me to just drive it off," Cameron said.</LD>
<TE>   Cameron first grabbed the lead from Kevin Richards on lap 91 and
held on until he pitted on lap 134.</TE>
<TE>   In the 50-lap Southern California Auto Club Late Model series
feature, Scott Youngren proved his win last week was no fluke by
leading for the final 40 laps of the race, holding off Mike Price and
Todd Burns. Burns also increased his lead in points to 32 over Tim
Huddleston, who finished sixth.</TE>
<TE>   In the 35-lap Grand American Modified series feature, Roger
Carufel Jr. needed only seven laps to take the lead and held off
Travis Thirkettle for his fifth win of the season. In that race,
Lloyd Mack III, brother of Indy Racing League rookie George Mack,
made his season debut in the series, finishing fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Solorzano</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hank Parker Jr. used fuel economy to win the NetZero 250, easily
holding off Busch Series leader Greg Biffle at Pikes Peak
International Raceway at Fountain, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Parker, who started 23rd in his Dodge, beat Biffle by 11.452
seconds after making only two pit stops in the 200-mile race. Parker
also gambled on fuel to win last year at California Speedway, his
only other Busch Series victory.</TE>
<TE>   Biffle, who started 20th, and third-place finisher Jason Keller
each made three stops in their Fords, with Biffle falling from first
to eighth on his last stop on lap 189. Biffle, 77 points ahead of
Keller in the season standings, fought overheating problems.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After struggling with fuel pressure problems that left him near
the back of the grid in the opening round of qualifying, Christiano
da Matta, the CART series leader stormed back to win the pole for the
Vancouver Molson-Indy at Vancouver, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   He turned his quick lap of 1 minute 0.339 seconds and 106.260 mph
on his fifth lap around the twisting 1.781-mile temporary street
circuit, just nine minutes into the session.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Tracy, who won the provisional pole Friday with a lap of
1:01.888, 103.600, knew going into Saturday he would start on the
front row, regardless of his second-round performance. Tracy fell
just short at 1:00.502, 105.973. That lap came with just 1:25 to go.</TE>

<LD>World Boxing Assn. heavyweight champion John Ruiz, floored in three
earlier rounds by low blows, was declared the winner in his title
defense against Kirk Johnson on Saturday night in the Mandalay Bay
Events Center at Las Vegas when the challenger threw yet another
punch below the belt in the 10th round.</LD>
<LD>   Referee Joe Cortez, who had penalized Johnson one point on two
occasions, halted it by disqualifying Johnson at 2:17 of the 10th.</LD>
<LD>   Ruiz was winning the fight on all the judges' cards despite having
to take time out the three earlier times he was hit low.</LD>
<TE>   A round earlier, Ruiz had to wait five minutes to resume after
Johnson hit him low.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what he was thinking," Ruiz said. "I came out
fighting clean, and he hit me low and I had to catch my breath. It
took me out of my game plan."</TE>
<TE>   Said Johnson: "I was starting to feel good, but then I don't know
what happened. It was terrible, man. It was my fault."</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, from Chelsea, Mass., improved to 38-4-1, with 27 knockouts.
Johnson, from North Preston, Canada, dropped to 32-1-1. Ruiz earned
$1.5 million and Johnson got $1 million.</TE>

<HD>Saints' Brooks Fails to Report</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New Orleans Saint quarterback Aaron Brooks did not report to training
camp and has not contacted the team.</LD>
<LD>   "Yes, I am surprised," General Manager Mickey Loomis said
Saturday. "We haven't heard from him, and we don't know why he isn't
here. No one's talked to him."</LD>
<LD>   Loomis said he assumes Brooks' failure to report Friday night was
a contract holdout.</LD>
<TE>   Brooks is in the final year of his contract, making the league
minimum of $400,000. The Saints made an offer to Brooks and received
a counter offer from Brooks' agent, Andre Colona.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Brooks tied a team record with 26 touchdown passes
and set team records for yards rushing by a quarterback (358 yards)
and total offense (4,190).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Running back William Green ended his five-day holdout by agreeing
to terms on a five-year, $7.85-million contract with the Cleveland
Browns.</TE>
<TE>   Green skipped his senior season at Boston College to turn pro
after gaining 1,559 yards and scoring 15 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo signed first-round pick Mike Williams, a 6-foot-6,
370-pound offensive lineman from Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the contract is expected
to make Williams the highest-paid rookie in club history and the
team's third-highest paid player behind quarterback Drew Bledsoe and
receiver Eric Moulds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia put running back Correll Buckhalter on the active
list of players physically unable to perform. Buckhalter tore a knee
ligament during minicamp in April.</TE>

<HD>Schilling Gets to 18th Win in a Hurry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Starting in spring training, Curt Schilling wanted to bring maximum
focus into every start.</LD>
<LD>   He has done that, and more.</LD>
<LD>   Schilling became the fastest pitcher to reach 18 victories in 26
years when he defeated the San Diego Padres, 4-3, Saturday at
Phoenix, leading the Arizona Diamondbacks to their sixth consecutive
victory.</LD>
<TE>   Randy Jones was the last pitcher to win 18 games before Aug. 1,
doing it for San Diego in 1976 en route to winning the Cy Young
Award.</TE>
<TE>   "I've said it all year and I'm going to keep saying it: We're
playing fantastic baseball on the days that I pitch," Schilling said.
"Today we played some unbelievable defense."</TE>
<TE>   Erubiel Durazo, activated from the disabled list hours earlier,
homered in his first game this month and was in on several strong
fielding plays.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Gonzalez drove in his 77th run with a groundout before Durazo
hit his ninth homer in 94 at-bats this year, a three-run drive during
a four-run fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling (18-3) gave up one run and eight hits in eight innings,
earning his 12th consecutive victory over a division opponent and
improving to 16-1 against NL teams.</TE>
<TE>   He has won six consecutive starts, giving him 150 career
victories.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander struck out seven and has 212, best in the majors.
He did not walk a batter, leaving him with only 18 walks in 169 2/3
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling has a 2.86 earned-run average and four more victories
than any other pitcher in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just phenomenal," Arizona Manager Bob Brenly said. "He
doesn't beat himself, he doesn't walk anybody, he's extremely quick
to the plate--you can't run on him. Depending on what he's got
working on a given day, he can go at you in a variety of ways."</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 5, Philadelphia 3--Chipper Jones hit a home run at
Atlanta, and Greg Maddux bounced back from his first loss in nearly
three months.</TE>
<TE>   Maddux (10-3) gave up one earned run in 5 2/3 innings to end
Philadelphia's four-game winning streak and hand Joe Roa (0-1) his
first defeat this season at any level. Roa had a 14-0 record at
triple-A.</TE>
<TE>   It was Maddux's 267th victory, giving him sole possession of 31st
place on the all-time list.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 7, St. Louis 3--Kerry Wood gave up one unearned run in six
innings at St. Louis and Moises Alou had three runs batted in to help
the Cubs end a four-game skid.</TE>
<TE>   Wood (9-5) gave up four hits, walked one and struck out three
before leaving after 87 pitches in the 95-degree heat.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs scored four runs against Jason Simontacchi (7-2) in the
third inning, with the help of a hit batter, two walks and Todd
Hundley's 10th homer.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 2, New York 1--Pinch-hitter Todd Walker hit a one-out
run-scoring single in the top of the 11th inning to lift the Reds.</TE>
<TE>   Walker lined a 2-and-2 pitch from rookie Jaime Cerda to center to
score Austin Kearns, who had doubled against Mark Corey (0-3) to
start the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 7, Montreal 2--Charles Johnson's three-run homer capped a
five-run first inning at Montreal, and A.J. Burnett struck out a
career-high 12 batters.</TE>
<TE>   Burnett (10-7) gave up two runs and five hits in eight innings.</TE>
<TE>   A crowd of 19,373, the fourth-largest Olympic Stadium crowd this
season, showed up for discount tickets and a hot dog promotion.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 3, Pittsburgh 0--Roy Oswalt pitched eight scoreless
innings at Houston and the Astros shut out the Pirates for the second
time in three games.</TE>
<TE>   Oswalt (11-6) gave up four hits, struck out nine and walked one.
Billy Wagner struck out the side in order in the ninth for his 20th
save in 25 opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 6, Colorado 5--Alex Ochoa's run-scoring bloop single in
the 10th inning at Milwaukee sent the Rockies to their fifth
consecutive defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Izzy Alcantara hit a one-out single against Jose Jimenez (2-7) in
the 10th, and pinch-runner Eric Young moved to third on Jose
Hernandez's single to right. Ochoa followed with a hit to right
field.</TE>

<HD>Trade Winds Are Warming</HD>

<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the clock ticking toward Wednesday night's nonwaiver deadline,
trade rumors are escalating faster than baseball's legal problems.</LD>
<LD>   Will Scott Rolen be traded? Jim Thome? Ellis Burks? Kenny Rogers?</LD>
<LD>   Do the Angels, still in the relief and outfield markets
themselves, have to worry that Rogers, who rejected Cincinnati, could
end up in Seattle? Or that Oakland, having already strengthened its
offense with the acquisition of Ray Durham, as General Manager Billy
Beane continues to demonstrate that good management can overcome
meager revenue, could next acquire Thome or Burks or even Cliff Floyd
or Randy Winn?</LD>
<TE>   Do the Dodgers, also seeking relief help, have to be concerned
that Rogers could go to Arizona or that San Francisco could end up
with Rolen or Winn?</TE>
<TE>   The only certainty is that one significant repository of available
players now seems to have been closed.</TE>
<TE>   Powered by the resurgent Mo Vaughn, who had slugged 11 home runs
in his last 26 games through Friday, the New York Mets have given up
their first-half claim to baseball's most underachieving team.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Atlanta Braves have pretty much clinched the National
League East, the rebounding Mets are back in the wild-card picture,
and no longer is Edgardo Alfonzo or Roberto Alomar or any other key
Met thought to be on the trade block.</TE>
<TE>   The two-year, $18-million signing of Al Leiter ended rumors about
his departure before the deadline and was an indication that the Mets
are still trying to salvage 2002, even if it's with the diminished
goal of a wild card.</TE>
<TE>   "We still believe we're a playoff contender," General Manager
Steve Phillips said at the Leiter news conference. "I hope a residual
effect of this deal is to show everyone that we still believe that."</TE>
<TE>   Inmates in Charge</TE>
<TE>   Rogers, the Texas left-hander who is 11-5 overall and has won six
of his last eight decisions, could be asked to waive his no-trade
clause more often than Fred McGriff was last year before the first
baseman agreed to leave Tampa Bay for the Chicago Cubs. Rogers said
he rejected Cincinnati for family reasons, but it's believed he
simply doesn't think the Reds can win this year and wasn't anxious to
experience Bob Boone's heavier-handed style of managing. However, he
probably would jump at the chance to join Seattle, having yielded
only two earned runs in 17 innings of two starts at Safeco Field this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Snubbed by Rogers ("If he doesn't want to be here, to hell with
him," said Sean Casey), the Reds were ready with a backup deal for
Detroit pitcher Brian Moehler.  General Manager Jim Bowden, having
already participated in a three-way deal that landed Ryan Dempster
(an 0-3 disappointment so far), must be given credit for trying to
keep his modest-revenue Reds in the playoff hunt.</TE>
<TE>   Bowden now has an offer of pitcher Scott Williamson and
infielder/outfielder Brandon Larson on the table for Rolen, according
to sources, but Philadelphia would have to pick up the remainder of
the third baseman's $8.6-million contract this year, an
insurmountable hurdle. Rolen is eligible for free agency at the end
of the season, wants to remain in the NL and hopes to relocate to the
Midwest (which would mean Cincinnati, St. Louis or Chicago), but he
may have to go as far as San Francisco if traded before Wednesday.
The Dodgers inquired before dealing for Tyler Houston but balked at
the idea of exchanging Adrian Beltre, 23, for Rolen's future
uncertainty--and price tag.</TE>
<TE>   If the Reds can find the money to make a Rolen deal happen, they
would move Aaron Boone to shortstop and Barry Larkin into a
second-base platoon with Todd Walker, providing Larkin agreed.
Meanwhile, the Moehler deal brought another Boone to Cincinnati (or,
at least, the Reds' organization) in the form of infielder Matt
Boone, the youngest of Bob's three sons.</TE>
<TE>   Boone has often claimed that Matt, 23, is more talented than
either Aaron or Bret, but he has spent five seasons at the Class-A
level, which didn't deter his dad from saying of the trade, "This
isn't nepotism. Matt has a real shot at playing in the big leagues.
He may end up being the key to this deal."</TE>
<TE>   Data Base</TE>
<TE>   Although the Minnesota Twins have been removed from the
contraction block and guaranteed of remaining in the Twin Cities
through 2003, Minnesota media outlets have continued a legal battle
with baseball and the Twins, trying to obtain release of a disc
containing 9,000 financial documents pertaining to the Twins,
contraction and, possibly, the relationship between owner Carl Pohlad
and Commissioner Bud Selig.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball's reluctance to release the documents is believed to be
one reason it settled the suit that will keep the Twins where they
are next season.</TE>
<TE>   However, the fight over similar internal documents can be expected
to flare on another front as the 14 former minority owners of the
Montreal Expos pursue that information to help prove their
allegations of mail and wire fraud against Selig and former Montreal
owner Jeffrey Loria. Said Jim Quinn, an attorney representing the 14
partners: "We think we have a significant amount of evidence already
but we will be pursuing more in discovery."</TE>

<HD>Armstrong Bids Adieu to Rivals</HD>
<DH>Tour de France: He wins time trial in 19th stage to prove
he has no peers on the eve of a fourth consecutive title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEITH B. RICHBURG</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>There were moments of surprise and suspense. There was even hopeful
talk from erstwhile rivals of a new era in cycling. But with
Saturday's penultimate stage--an individual test against the
clock--Lance Armstrong proved once again that he still dominates the
Tour de France, outpacing all opponents in power, speed and sheer
determination.</LD>
<LD>   Barring some unforeseen event, Armstrong will ride today onto the
Champs-Elysee as the winner of his fourth consecutive Tour de France,
becoming only the fifth rider--and the first American--to win
cycling's most grueling contest four times.</LD>
<LD>   His path to victory was largely set in the mountain stages of the
Pyrenees and the Alps, when he simply overpowered his rivals and took
a commanding lead that he never relinquished. He made his push to the
front of the pack in the 11th stage of the 20-stage tour--a 98-mile
slog in the Pyrenees from Pau to La Mongie that he finished with a
late sprint seven seconds ahead of Spaniard Joseba Beloki.</LD>
<TE>   Armstrong cemented his victory in Macon, racing through a 31-mile
time trial through the Beaujolais vineyards at an average speed of 29
mph. He finished in 1 hour 3 minutes 50 seconds, a full 52 seconds
ahead of the second-place finisher, Lithuanian Raimondas Rumsas.
Rumsas had been leading for much of the stage until he had problems
with loose screws on his handlebars during his final descent.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong extended his overall lead to 7 minutes 17 seconds, his
second-largest winning margin since he won the 1999 Tour by 7 minutes
37 seconds. And that Tour four years ago was remarkable enough, since
it marked Armstrong's comeback to the sport after a battle with
testicular cancer that ravaged his body and forced him to undergo
brain surgery and months of painful chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   The time trial was also a sort of vindication for the 30-year-old
Texan, coming 12 days after the 34-mile time trial on July 15 across
wind-swept Brittany. Armstrong had been expected to win that stage
but instead found himself in the rare position of pulling in second,
behind upstart Colombian Santiago Botero, with the Kelme team.</TE>
<TE>   It was after that time trial that Armstrong's rivals sensed blood,
and began predicting that the American who had so dominated the sport
was finally losing his form.</TE>
<TE>   "The Tour has changed," boasted Spanish rider Igor Gonzalez de
Galdeano, who at that stage held the overall yellow leader's jersey.
"Armstrong isn't as strong in the time trials as he was a year ago."</TE>
<TE>   Even Armstrong at the time seemed to go along, perhaps coaxing his
opponents into overconfidence. "The Tour isn't monotone after all,"
he said after that disappointment. "There are other riders out
there."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, it was Armstrong in yellow and on the podium taking the
bouquet of flowers and kissing the cheeks of the girls in yellow.
Gonzalez de Galdeano finished fifth, 1 minute 42 seconds back, and
Beloki was ninth over the line, 2:11 after Armstrong. His time was
enough to keep him in second place overall.</TE>
<TE>   Beloki, for a time seen as the strongest competitor to Armstrong,
seems content now to arrive in second place at the Champs-Elysee.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless something strange happens, I think I should finish second
in Paris," Beloki said.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong gave credit to his fellow riders on the U.S. Postal
Service team during a Saturday news conference. Without comparing his
team and performance with those of the greats of the past, he said,
"Every year is different and every era is different. But I don't know
how a team could be any stronger."</TE>
<TE>   Others were even more effusive in placing Armstrong among the
pantheon of great cyclists.</TE>
<TE>   "Comparisons are always odious, but there is no doubt that
Armstrong is one of the great riders," said 1988 Spanish champion
Pedro Delgado, in an interview with the Spanish sports daily Marca.
"There are two reasons why--first, his physical power, and second,
for his meticulous approach to everything, including his preparation,
his bikes, and his team."</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Marie Leblanc, director of the 2002 Tour, said, "At the
start, we all knew that Lance Armstrong would not have rivals of his
worth.</TE>
<TE>   "Armstrong was far too superior, far too much of a master of this
sport."</TE>

<TE>   Tour at a Glance</TE>
<TE>   A look at Saturday's 19th stage of the 89th Tour de France:</TE>
<TE>   Stage: An individual time trial of 31 miles from Regnie-Durette to
Macon in central France.</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Three-time defending Tour champion Lance Armstrong, in 1
hour 3 minutes 50 seconds. Raimondas Rumsas of Lithuania finished
second, 53 seconds behind. It was the 15th Tour stage victory of
Armstrong's career and stretched his lead in the overall standings by
more than 2 minutes to 7:17 with one stage left.</TE>
<TE>   How others fared: Joseba Beloki of Spain, who's second in the
overall standings, finished ninth Saturday, 2:11 behind.</TE>
<TE>   Quote of the day: "After the first time trial, everyone said,
'Armstrong isn't good at time trials.' Today, I was very motivated to
come back with a win."--Armstrong, who finished second in a time
trial July 15.</TE>
<TE>   Next stage: Today's 20th and final stage is 89 miles from Melun to
the Champs Elysees in Paris. It's traditionally a leisurely,
ceremonial ride.</TE>

<HD>They Are Not Tiger Woods</HD>
<DH>African American pros seeking support get no help from
golf's No.1 player</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Pomp Braswell II is Tiger Woods.</LD>
<LD>   That's what he believed. That's what he was sold.</LD>
<LD>   Braswell is African American, grew up in South-Central Los
Angeles, didn't hit a golf ball until he was 18, then stumbled into
Rancho Park and fell in love with a game that had long excluded
people like him.</LD>
<TE>   He practiced until his left shoulder broke and his savings were
busted. He cleaned toilets at country clubs during the day so he
could play a free round at dusk.</TE>
<TE>   Braswell became good enough to win. But, snubbed by sponsors and
stared down by patrons, he never felt good enough to belong.</TE>
<TE>   Then, five years ago at the Masters, Woods became the first golfer
of African American descent to win a major golf championship.</TE>
<TE>   And, like many other African American golfers, Braswell leaped and
cheered and truly believed the game had changed.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't that what the commercials later said? The ones with the
diverse group of children staring into the camera and smiling?</TE>
<TE>   "I am Tiger Woods."</TE>
<TE>   Didn't he appear on another commercial painting him as the next
Jackie Robinson?</TE>
<TE>   "It was all going to be different," Braswell said. "We had been
waiting a long time for something like this. It was finally
happening."</TE>
<TE>   Yet a few months after Woods hugged his father in Augusta,
Braswell was sleeping in his car in Montana.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to win a tournament with an empty wallet, he bathed in the
locker room, putted for Big Macs and crumbled under the pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Later that year, he wrote to 100 companies in search of
sponsorships, phoned 100 CEOs, received 100 rejections.</TE>
<TE>   Today, despite seven victories and 17 top-five finishes in
satellite events in the last five years, Pomp Braswell is again broke
and again searching, for the last time, for someone to support his
dream.</TE>
<TE>   Some nights he awakens in his tiny apartment, pulls out a milk
crate and an eight-iron and climbs onto the crate to practice his
balance.</TE>
<TE>   Once, at 4 a.m., his wife padded out of bed to discover him in the
middle of the living room, swinging a wedge hard enough to leave
scars on the cottage cheese ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year in Arkansas, fearful of pulling out of a
tournament that would help him pay the rent, he played through a bout
of diarrhea, shooting two under par despite soiling himself on the
fifth hole.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone says Tiger Woods opened doors for African Americans,"
Braswell said. "I'm trying to find those doors. I'm really trying."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods is Tiger Woods.</TE>
<TE>   He is not Jackie Robinson. He is not Arthur Ashe. He is not
Muhammad Ali.</TE>
<TE>   Five years after Woods made the televised promise to redecorate
golf's country clubs, the furniture has barely been moved.</TE>
<TE>   Woods is still the only African American golfer on the PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   There are no African Americans on the LPGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   There is only one African American on the Buy.com Tour, considered
one step below the PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   Only four African Americans compete on the Hooters Tour, two steps
below the PGA.</TE>
<TE>   In a world where 80% of even minor-league golfers have monetary
help, allowing them to concentrate only on golf while working toward
the tour, the African American golfers are generally a distracted
group, scrounging desperately for help among a small group of other
African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "You see guys barely breaking 80, getting all kinds of money
thrown at them, $100,000 a year to play golf," said Tim O'Neal, who
missed qualifying for his PGA Tour card last year by one stroke. "You
never see that kind of money thrown at a black guy."</TE>
<TE>   The problem is so real that actor Will Smith formed a company,
Treyball Sports Management, solely to address it.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of African American golfers out there, but nobody
is hearing from them, because nine out of 10 don't have accessibility
to the money," said Craig Crossley, Treyball manager whose company
sponsors O'Neal and female golfer Dara Broadus. "Our sole intention
to find these kids and give them a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Woods was supposed to change all of this.</TE>
<TE>   But insiders say he has little contact with the PGA Tour hopefuls,
nor does he allow them into his network.</TE>
<TE>   Where Jackie Robinson once embraced and mentored Roy Campanella,
Woods keeps his distance.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say Woods, in becoming the best player in the world, has
joined the insulated country club culture he once purported to
change.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish Tiger would reach back and help these guys, it would be a
really nice gesture," said Nathaniel Goldston, chairman of Gourmet
Services Inc., the food service giant that sponsors Andy Walker on
the Buy.com Tour.</TE>
<TE>   While some players would like to see Woods use some of his
enormous fortune for sponsorships--many expect he will be the first
billion-dollar athlete--Goldston said it's all about influence.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still a little bit of a good ol' boy network out there, and
it's hard for us to crack," said Goldston. "If Tiger tried, he would
wield a lot of weight."</TE>
<TE>   Goldston has tried for two years to enter Walker into Atlanta's
BellSouth Classic on a sponsor's exemption. He has called everyone
from Hank Aaron to Andrew Young, to no avail.</TE>
<TE>   "They have spots, but they never have a spot for us," he said.
"Can you imagine if Tiger ever made just one call, told organizers
that he had a couple of guys that needed a chance?</TE>
<TE>   "They would be like, 'Whatever you need, Tiger.' "</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a couple of years ago, Woods made one comment about
inequities on the PGA Tour, and officials rushed to placate him.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of us out here talk about it," O'Neal said. "I'm not saying
Tiger is right or wrong. I'm just saying I'd do it different."</TE>
<TE>   Woods' handlers said that he was taking time off after the British
Open and would not be available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   But his remarks at Muirfield before the British Open supported the
theory that he has become something less than a people's champion.</TE>
<TE>   When asked whether Augusta National should allow women members, he
said, "It's their prerogative."</TE>
<TE>   When asked if he felt the same way about clubs that denied access
to minorities such as African Americans and Asians, he said, "Yes, I
do."</TE>
<TE>   While the comments caused a stir in the media, they barely raised
an eyebrow among those who have followed him closest.</TE>
<TE>   The other African American golfers have long since understood the
paradox of playing in the shadow of this reluctant pioneer.</TE>
<TE>   They say potential sponsors continually compare them to Woods, as
if all African Americans are supposed to be that good.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like, if you're black, then you've got to be as good as
Tiger, or you're not worth it," said Braswell.</TE>
<TE>   This, combined with Woods' refusal to offer help, has made their
mandate clear.</TE>
<TE>   Some of them feel they will succeed on the PGA Tour not because of
Tiger Woods, but in spite of him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Andy Walker is Tiger Woods.</TE>
<TE>   You'd think.</TE>
<TE>   He is the second-ranked African American golfer in the world, a
member of Pepperdine's national championship team in 1997, and is
poised to join Woods on the PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   Yet when Walker offered to wear Woods' clothing line on tour this
year, he was refused.</TE>
<TE>   "There are two African Americans at this level in the world, and
for us not to have any contact or meaningful relationship?" said
Walker. "That's kind of sad."</TE>
<TE>   Walker said the division between Woods and himself is clear.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not the kind of cat he hangs around," Walker said. "I'm
Jay-Z, he's Hootie and the Blowfish."</TE>
<TE>   Although Woods' mother is Asian American, and although Woods has
called himself "Cablanasian," his first comments after his first
Masters win clearly defined his African American sensibilities.</TE>
<TE>   He said that walking up the 18th fairway, he felt gratitude to
Charlie Sifford and Lee Elder and other African American golfers who
had paved the way.</TE>
<TE>   "I said a little prayer of thanks to those guys," Woods said at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   Today's African American pros don't give thanks to Woods, or
really have time to reflect on much of anything.</TE>
<TE>   They still work in a stressful world where they are viewed as
different, a world where there are no major championship platforms
that can erase such differences.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always been difficult, it's always been a challenge," said
Walker. "Maybe Tiger has opened doors somewhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Odom, a Carlsbad resident who plays the Hooters Tour, was
recently hassled by kids shouting "white power!" during his backswing
at a tournament practice session in Chattanooga, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   While crossing a street to reach the next hole, Odom grabbed a
four-iron and prepared to defend himself before the kids backed away.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I think it's not fair that we have to step off a tee
box and have those thoughts in our heads," Odom said. "Nobody else
has to do that."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was recently ordered out of a locker room in Eugene, Ore.,
before he explained that he was actually in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the guy, 'What makes you think I'm not a player?' " O'Neal
said. "Those little things happen to us all the time."</TE>
<TE>   According to the National Golf Foundation, in the last nine years,
there has been more than a 100% increase in the number of African
Americans playing golf.</TE>
<TE>   That number is now approximately 882,000 out a total golf
population of 26.7 million, or 3.3%.</TE>
<TE>   "I see more black faces out there," Odom said. "But I don't see
more black faces playing competitively."</TE>
<TE>   Braswell said it is little wonder that somebody is always asking
him to carry their clubs.</TE>
<TE>   While Woods becomes a worldwide fixture, other African American
golfers remain a novelty.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys still look at you, guys still talk," said Braswell, who
stands out at 6 feet 4, 245 pounds. "Their body language is still,
what the hell are you doing out here?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Why do you think you're Tiger Woods?</TE>
<TE>   And why should Tiger Woods care?</TE>
<TE>   So wonders Joe Louis Barrow Jr., executive director of The First
Tee, this country's largest golf program for young minorities.</TE>
<TE>   "For everyone to say we have to have a plethora of African
Americans on the tour, that's not a realistic view," said Barrow, son
of the late boxer Joe Louis. "And to place that burden on Tiger is
unrealistic and unfair."</TE>
<TE>   Barrow, like those involved in the Tiger Woods Foundation,
believes golf is best diversified at a young age.</TE>
<TE>   The First Tee has built 89 golf centers in inner cities.</TE>
<TE>   The Tiger Woods Foundation has held 25 clinics in 25 cities while
donating to junior golf in those areas.</TE>
<TE>   "But what happens when all those kids get into college and try to
go out and make a living?" said Crossley of Treyball Sports. "What
happens to them then?"</TE>
<TE>   Countered Barrow, "What is to say that you must define successful
golf as being a success on the tour? What if they pursue a career on
the business side?"</TE>
<TE>   Woods' supporters say his influence is about more than just golf.</TE>
<TE>   "Our foundation is not a golf foundation," said Greg McLaughlin,
executive director of the Los Alamitos-based Woods foundation. "There
is a bigger picture involved."</TE>
<TE>   Woods' foundation donates money to numerous causes, including
Target House, a home for children being treated at St. Jude
Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing our part for kids," McLaughlin said. "The point goes
beyond golf."</TE>
<TE>   Barrow agreed, saying, "If you're saying Tiger should just give
money to younger golfers, why place that burden on him? You're not
asking the same thing of Davis Love or Phil Mickelson or Notah
Begay."</TE>
<TE>   Barrow said Woods' social impact, changing the perception of golf
in this country, is enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Tiger is an entrepreneur," Barrow said. "He is going out and
making some money. That's his job. Don't place these extra burdens on
him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pomp Braswell II is Tiger Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Still is. Still believes.</TE>
<TE>   He's 34. He plays with donated clubs. He once played a tournament
that cost $150 to enter and paid $248 when he won.</TE>
<TE>   The Culver City High graduate and former San Jose State player
watches his two young children in their tiny Phoenix apartment while
wife Amparo works during the day. Then he rushes out to hit balls
before dark.</TE>
<TE>   "All I need is one more chance," he said. "Just give me a chance
to play two years without worrying about where my next meal is coming
from. See how I play then."</TE>
<TE>   He played the Hooters Tour with a sponsor for much of the last
year, but then they parted ways this spring.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's feeling a lot of pressure," said Sam May, a Detroit
real estate broker who backed Braswell. "I think it's very hard for
him."</TE>
<TE>   Hard?</TE>
<TE>   For Braswell, hard is working all day at a golf range in Laguna
Hills, then turning on the lights and hitting balls at 1 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Or raking the bunkers at a golf school in exchange for a lesson.</TE>
<TE>   Or playing 36 holes on a granola bar.</TE>
<TE>   Or trying to make a living at a sport he didn't discover until he
was an adult.</TE>
<TE>   Braswell has considered quitting, but Amparo refuses to allow it.</TE>
<TE>   "A man works this hard, something good will happen to him, I know
it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   And so he keeps playing, if only on weekends, or in his living
room, or in his mind.</TE>
<TE>   Braswell wears a rubber band on his left wrist. He snaps it when
things are going bad, reminding him to concentrate on the good.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's to say it's too late?" he said, snap-snap-snapping. "Who's
to say?"</TE>

<HD>Gambill Finds Some Motivation</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jan-Michael Gambill channeled his fury over a two-sentence mention in
a column written about Andy Roddick into some positive tennis energy
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Gambill had just upset the fourth-seeded Roddick, 7-5, 6-3, in the
semifinals of the Mercedes-Benz Cup at UCLA. But this performance,
one of controlled intelligence, careful serving from the sunny side
of the court, unerring passing shots and tranquil acceptance of some
uneven officiating, seemed secondary to Gambill afterward.</LD>
<LD>   He had been dissed.</LD>
<TE>   A witch, Jan-Michael Gambill called me. Twice. And something else
too, with a meaning unable to be conveyed in any straightforward way
in a paper read by many over breakfast eggs.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe your career is over too, woman," Gambill said, his face
turning red, his hands twitching.</TE>
<TE>   Gambill was an angry young man. He was furious that someone would
write that since he's ranked No. 53 on the pro tennis computer,
that's the place his talent has taken him.</TE>
<TE>   Not that there's anything to be ashamed of, being ranked the
53rd-best anything in the world.</TE>
<TE>   But Gambill has higher aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   "My talent took me to No. 3 in the world," Gambill said. Which was
true for a moment in March 2001 in the Champions Race, the points
system used to determine entry into the end-of-the-year finale.
Gambill missed that finale. Not enough points. And on the computer
that seeds players into tournaments, the ATP entry system, Gambill
has never been ranked higher than No. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Whether he's 53rd best, as the computer says now, or 14th, as the
computer once said, or an illusory third, Gambill might want to
consider thanking me for shaking up his world so thoroughly.</TE>
<TE>   Egos are fragile in this tennis world, where the players are
coddled by entourages of coaches, trainers, parents, public relations
handlers. They are chauffeured from hotel, to court, to practice, to
airport by limos provided by the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   When golfers walk off the practice tee, they will submit to
interviews. When tennis players leave the practice court they hustle
off in the middle of a pod of frowning protectors making sure no
unmannerly journalist stops them to ask a question.</TE>
<TE>   Major League Baseball players, NFL players, NBA players, even most
college athletes answer questions after every game and most workouts.
They might choose to ignore the interlopers in their locker rooms and
clubhouses, but they have to do the ignoring face to face. They must
at least say no.</TE>
<TE>   But a tennis player, male or female, is mostly made known to the
fans who buy the tickets that pay them their prize money via the
postmatch news conference. The player sits in an easy chair
surrounded by plants and answers questions asked by anonymous
inquisitors. A few moments of private time with a player usually
entails some begging.</TE>
<TE>   These athletes aren't often criticized. They also aren't often
made to be real people. We are allowed only small glimpses into the
minds and hearts of these performers. Always describing the forehands
and backhands and nothing else is not the way to capture the public
interest.</TE>
<TE>   So in a way this outburst of Gambill's was worthwhile.</TE>
<TE>   We learned that he reads.</TE>
<TE>   Gambill came stomping into the interview room waving a copy of a
Times story, demanding to know who wrote those offensive words. He
offered an ultimatum that he would answer no questions from the
writer. He fumed that there had been the intimation that his career
was over. He excused his ranking by saying that injuries, which kept
him off the tour earlier this season, were the reason for his
ranking. Not his skills.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the promise of being ranked No. 14 last year, Gambill's
career has not been particularly distinguished. In 35 Grand Slam
tournament matches, Gambill is 15-20 and he's gotten past the third
round only once.</TE>
<TE>   In the tournament semifinals preview notes, written by ATP
staffers, it says, "Gambill has had somewhat inconsistent results
this year," that he "struggled on Europe's clay courts," and that he
is "looking to redeem himself heading into the summer hard court
swing."</TE>
<TE>   If Gambill finds it too harsh to read about himself that he is
ranked No. 53 because that is where his talent takes him, Gambill
should be thankful that he is not Dodger third baseman Adrian Beltre,
for example.</TE>
<TE>   And if Gambill can be brought to an angry boil so quickly, maybe
he is a young man worth keeping an eye on. Gambill is 25. At his age,
most tennis pros have produced their highest rankings--and their best
tennis.</TE>
<TE>   Gambill's anger over the two sentences, he told an ATP tour
representative, propelled him to Saturday's win. Maybe a kick in the
backside is a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   According to Gambill's official biography, he enjoys spending time
at the beach--he was selected in 2000 as one of People Magazine's "50
Most Beautiful People in the World"--and he is "a self-proclaimed
Trekkie."</TE>
<TE>   He has also won two singles titles in six years. Maybe it's all
about the injuries. Gambill did, after all, withdraw during the final
against Michael Chang here two years ago because of a bad ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe it's all about the talent. Maybe Gambill isn't quite good
enough to win tournaments. And if that makes Gambill mad enough to
beat Andre Agassi in today's final, then your friendly neighborhood
motivational columnist will accept Jan-Michael's hearty postmatch
thank you.</TE>

<HD>Wins Over These Giants Were Only Minor Feats</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers win, the Dodgers win, and the Dodgers don't have a chance
of winning the pennant.</LD>
<LD>   Ordinarily two consecutive wins over the Giants on enemy ground
would be uplifting, but these were the best the Dodgers had to offer
going against the Fresno Grizzlies the last two days, and while it
came at a season-saving time after a colossal collapse after the
All-Star break, it's fool's gold.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers need to do something meaningful before Wednesday's
trading deadline, or the only reason to spend time in Dodger Stadium
the next two months will be to watch the scoreboard and see how the
Angels are doing.</LD>
<TE>   "Are the Angels for real?" Shawn Green wanted to know after the
Dodgers' 5-1 victory Saturday, and I have no idea about that, but
watching the Dodgers try to recapture the magic--and magic can be the
only explanation for such a good start to the season--is going to be
a waste of time.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't buy that," said Manager Jim Tracy. "I'm going to be
defiant with you on this one. I like the way my team has played the
last two games, which is in the same manner we played when we were
doing so well the first half of the season."</TE>
<TE>   So what we have here is a basic difference of opinion, with Tracy
already demonstrating earlier in the day he has no idea what he's
talking about when looking down the road: "I think the Washington
Redskins are going to finish first or second in their division this
season."</TE>
<TE>   A few days ago he didn't know who was in the Redskins' division,
but no matter, he said, Coach Steve Spurrier has the secret to
success.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier, however, has three stiffs at quarterback in Danny
Wuerrfel, Shane Matthews and Sage Rosenfels, which isn't much
different these days than asking Terry Mulholland, Guillermo Mota and
Giovanni Carrara to save the day. I can see how Tracy relates.</TE>
<TE>   We'll see if the Redskins can score; we already know the Dodgers
won't score much as long as Cesar Izturis bats left-handed, Brian
Jordan hits cleanup and Green remains out of rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   So far they've only proven they can score more than the Grizzlies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE LAST time the Dodgers won two in a row was July 5-6, which
explains why Tracy, the dreamer, was so giddy after beating the
Grizzlies.</TE>
<TE>   "You get a wave and you ride it," said Tracy, who grew up in Ohio
and probably saw his first wave on "Baywatch."</TE>
<TE>   You're supposed to beat the Giants when they're helpless, and the
Dodgers have done that, but is this really a turnaround?</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've turned the corner," said Green, who has not hit a
home run in 15 games. "We've put a bunch of hits on the board and
made things happen, which is different than the past few weeks when
there was no sign of life."</TE>
<TE>   It took Tyler Houston in his first game as a Dodger to ignite this
so-called resurrection, and a series of very helpful rulings from
first base umpire John Hirschbeck and the Little League arm of Tom
Goodwin to propel the Dodgers to another victory.</TE>
<TE>   We might be checking for a pulse again in a few days.</TE>
<TE>   The next series could be even more important than this one--a
three-game series in Cincinnati against the wild card-minded Reds
coinciding with the trading deadline. Where are you, Dan Evans?</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers fell out of first on Aug. 11 a year ago, and lost the
wild-card lead on Sept. 8. They're ahead of schedule this year,
falling from first on July 16.</TE>
<TE>   They have a two-game lead in the wild-card hunt now, and if
nothing happens by Wednesday to bolster a team light on offense and
shaky in middle relief, the guess here is the Dodgers and Redskins
will have the same kind of season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHY NOT play Adrian Beltre at shortstop and Houston at third on
occasion to add some pop to the lineup? Izturis is now hitting less
than .200 left-handed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ERIC KARROS found himself on the bench because Tracy elected to
stay with Houston, who went four for four in his Dodger debut. Before
anyone could start referring to Karros as Wally Pipp, however,
Houston demonstrated he is no Lou Gehrig, going 0 for 5.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KARROS AND his wife, Trish, had a baby to be named later Friday.
Eric suggested Kyle for the boy's name, Trish likes Garrett, so I'm
guessing the child will be named Garrett.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE CRITICS who suggest Ryan Leaf was one of the biggest busts in
NFL history are not giving him his due. I can't think of a bigger
bust, and I even took Cade McNown into consideration.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN I first heard the allegations that a company led by former
Hollywood Park chairman R.D. Hubbard flew prostitutes from Los
Angeles to Indiana to mix with high rollers at a casino-sponsored
golf tournament, I called Hubbard to express my surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know Los Angeles had hookers."</TE>
<TE>   Hubbard said he couldn't talk then, but said I'd learn more later.
The Times reported that Indiana officials determined the hookers were
from Nevada. I didn't think they could be from L.A.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MICHAEL IRVIN says his problems in life have stemmed from his
addiction to sex, but he's reformed now. I just have one question:
Did he express an interest in working on "The Best Damn Sports Show
Period" before or after Lisa Guerrero had posted her open-blouse
picture on foxsports.com?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Jason Hand:</TE>
<TE>   "You make fun of Doug Flutie, calling him a shrimp. I don't think
that's right. Do you know what it's like to be really short? I'm
probably no taller than Doug ... "</TE>
<TE>   It's a small, small world.</TE>

<KH>SOCCER GRAHAME L. JONES</KH>
<HD>Going After Gascoigne Is Risky Business</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major League Soccer is about to give more than one-quarter of a
million dollars to a man who doesn't want to see his name in the
newspapers or hear it on the evening news.</LD>
<LD>   D.C. United is about to acquire a player whose most fabled
exploits in the last decade or so have involved the public
consumption of vast amounts of alcohol and the not-so-public abuse of
his wife, plus other assorted unseemly escapades.</LD>
<LD>   Ray Hudson, coach of the three-time MLS champions, acknowledges
that it's all a huge gamble, one that could backfire badly on him,
his team and the league.</LD>
<TE>   So why on earth are MLS and D.C. United even talking to Paul
Gascoigne?</TE>
<TE>   Because they're desperate.</TE>
<TE>   The league virtually vanished in the shadow of the World Cup and
has not found a way to emerge. D.C. United, once the flagship team of
MLS, is perilously close to not making the playoffs for the third
season in a row.</TE>
<TE>   So it was time to go fishing, time to reel in Gascoigne.</TE>
<TE>   No one calls him that, of course. For 18 years he has been simply
"Gazza," one of the lads, the once bright and shining star of English
soccer, now reduced to seeking a place to play in what are,
essentially, soccer's backwaters.</TE>
<TE>   Because that's the way MLS is viewed from where Gazza comes. The
league might have taken several promising steps in its seven years,
but every time it opens its fields to horses too old and too unsteady
to race any longer, it takes a step back.</TE>
<TE>   Gascoigne is 35. That's long in the tooth for a soccer player.
Whether he can still keep up remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   Burnley didn't think so. The English first division team did not
renew his contract at the end of last season. It seemed the end of
the road for Gascoigne, but he found that being a free agent can be
almost as useful as being a free spirit.</TE>
<TE>   America beckoned and Gascoigne listened.</TE>
<TE>   He had started out with Newcastle United (Hudson's former club) as
a 17-year-old in 1984 and had gone on to play for Tottenham Hotspur,
Lazio, Rangers, Middlesbrough, Everton and Burnley. Now, new worlds
called.</TE>
<TE>   "He has always wanted to play in the States, and it's a standard
of football he will be comfortable with," said his agent, Ian
Elliott.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott might be twice wrong in that assessment.</TE>
<TE>   First, there are a growing number of good players in the league,
players Gascoigne might struggle to keep up with on the field.</TE>
<TE>   Second, D.C. United is not much of a team. Gascoigne is unlikely
to be impressed by a club that has won only six of 18 games this
season and which, in Hudson's view, was "embarrassing, pathetic and
woeful," in one recent loss.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to get the whip out now and just flog them," he told the
Washington Post last week.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Gascoigne could fit right in, if a recent description of
his play is anything to go by.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two seasons, in which he has played only 21 games,
Gazza "became something of a caricature of himself, his aging and
injury-ravaged body unable to produce the sort of wondrous moments
that propelled him to stardom in the first place," a Reuters report
stated.</TE>
<TE>   Supposedly, however, he is in reasonable shape. When he arrived in
Washington on Wednesday, he was said to be tanned and fit after two
weeks of conditioning work in Cyprus.</TE>
<TE>   He trained with D.C. United on Friday, was scheduled to watch the
team's game today, train again Monday and possibly Tuesday and then
make a decision Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   That is, assuming MLS and D.C. United don't make a decision first.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing Gascoigne to MLS in 1996, the league's inaugural season
when such playmakers as Carlos Valderrama, Marco Etcheverry and
Mauricio Cienfuegos arrived, might have made sense. Now, it is
questionable at best.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Don Garber realizes that and knows that Gazza brings
a lot of baggage with him, but is willing to let that slide.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to think we shouldn't be haunted by our past," he told
the Washington Post.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is entitled to have the right to prove that they're a
different person, a new person, and [that they] have learned from
their mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Hudson believes Gazza has learned.</TE>
<TE>   "The impression I get is that he wants to move on with his life in
several areas, and he really wants to enjoy the game again," he said.
"He'll be pretty much totally anonymous in the D.C. area, and he'll
be able to blend in as a complete unknown."</TE>
<TE>   That seems to be Gazza's desire. When asked Friday why he wanted
to come to MLS, he replied: "To get away from the press."</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to be myself, have a life," he said. "I'm not here to
cause any trouble, I don't want to cause any bother."</TE>
<TE>   Hudson liked hearing that.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want any embarrassments," he said. "This is the biggest
gamble of my career. But that's the seduction of a player like Gazza.
It's the promise of magic."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the best opinion was voiced by Gascoigne's former
Tottenham teammate, Gary Mabbutt.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope Gazza goes there to take it seriously and not as a
holiday," Mabbutt told the British Press Assn. "It'll be far from
that. He'll have to establish himself.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like when the first American league started, with Pele,
Franz Beckenbauer and Johan Cruyff there to entertain people. Now,
it's more serious and competitive--and from watching the World Cup
you can see the American players are very fit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be tough for Gazza, but I feel he has the ability
to enjoy a couple of seasons there.</TE>
<TE>   "Gazza will be welcomed [because] he has quality and can do the
unexpected. His type of football will be very much appreciated by
American fans. He's going into the twilight of his career, but ...
he's one of the best players I ever played with and one of the few
players I would still pay to watch."</TE>
<TE>   The league and D.C. United are counting on just that.</TE>

Wednesday over Portland. Mwadi Mabika has moved into the league's top
10 in scoring; she is eighth at 16.1 points a game. Lisa Leslie
(16.2) is seventh. Indiana has won its last two, and is tied for
fifth in the Eastern Conference. Those who have not seen Fever
forward Tamika Catchings play should take a look at the WNBA's
leading candidate for rookie of the year. Not only is Catchings
leading the league in scoring (18.0) and collecting 8.2 rebounds, she
also works hard on the defensive end. In Indiana's 73-63 victory over
Minnesota on Friday, Catchings tied the league record with nine

<HD>Williams' Daughter Skeptical of Note</HD>
<DH>Jurisprudence: Lawyer for Williams Ferrell says she
questions whether hall of famer was able to sign document stating he
wanted remains frozen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INVERNESS, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A lawyer for Ted Williams' daughter says a note the late hall of
famer signed signaling his wishes to be cryonically preserved is
suspect.</LD>
<LD>   Bobby-Jo Williams Ferrell is questioning whether her father was
capable of making a decision on how his body should be treated after
death. Williams had been suffering from congestive heart failure.</LD>
<LD>   He died July 5 at age 83.</LD>
<TE>   John Heer, an attorney for Ferrell, said that Williams was in the
hospital undergoing treatment for congestive heart failure in
November 2000--when the document purportedly was signed.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't believe Mr. Williams would have been physically capable
of signing it at [that] time," Heer told the Associated Press on
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many things that jump out at me, not even being an
expert.... The date appears to have been changed. We cannot tell when
the signatures were placed on there."</TE>
<TE>   Heer's questioning of the document was reported Saturday by the
St. Petersburg Times.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrell is fighting Williams' two other children's wishes to keep
his body frozen. His body was sent to Alcor Life Extension
Foundation, an Arizona laboratory that does cryonic preservation.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' son, John Henry, and daughter, Claudia, have produced a
handwritten note in which the aging Williams asks that his body be
frozen. It was filed Thursday in Citrus County Probate Court.</TE>
<TE>   The signatures of Williams, John Henry and Claudia are on the note
dated Nov. 2, 2000, four years after Williams signed a will calling
for his cremation.</TE>
<TE>   "JHW, Claudia and Dad all agree to be put into bio-stasis after we
die," reads the pact, which family attorney Bob Goldman said was
written in a Gainesville hospital room before the baseball great
underwent surgery. Williams had a pacemaker inserted in his chest
Nov. 6, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Heer said he plans to hire handwriting experts to examine the
pact, and questioned whether Williams knew what he was signing, if he
signed it.</TE>
<TE>   "He always signed his legal documents 'Theodore S. Williams,' and
when he was signing memorabilia, he signed 'Ted Williams,' " Heer
said. "He signed this document 'Ted Williams.' "</TE>

<HD>Gambill Rides on Roddick's Wild Side</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Veteran benefits from 19-year-old foe's spectacular
mishits and wins, 7-5, 6-3. He'll face Agassi in final at UCLA.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To say that Andy Roddick's straight-set loss to Jan-Michael Gambill
came down to one or two shots would be a version of sports shorthand.
After all, the match lasted 1 hour 11 minutes under the hot sun at
UCLA on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   But one or two shots showed it just wasn't going to fall right for
the fourth-seeded Roddick. He framed a second serve, down set point,
and the ball went flying away, along with the first set. In the
second, two points from losing, Roddick took a big backswing, looking
for a decent crack at Gambill's second serve, and sent the return way
long.</LD>
<LD>   These aren't the shots the 19-year-old Roddick is known for. But
sports shorthand would exclude the guy on the other side of the net.
Gambill skillfully mixed up his serve, hitting 12 aces and changing
speeds, and made an important mid-match correction, saving two set
points.</LD>
<TE>   It all added up to a 7-5, 6-3 victory against Roddick in a
Mercedes-Benz Cup semifinal. In today's final, he will play Andre
Agassi, the defending champion. Agassi, seeded second, had few
worries in the night semifinal, defeating eighth-seeded Max Mirnyi of
Belarus, 6-4, 6-2, in 61 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Mirnyi is known for his powerful serve, but his strength played
right into Agassi's best weapon, his vaunted return game. Agassi
converted four of nine on break-point opportunities and lost his
serve only once.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi's dominance only expanded in the second set. He lost one
point in the first four games, and dropped one point on his own serve
in the entire set.</TE>
<TE>   He ended the semifinal in emphatic fashion, hitting a 114-mph ace.</TE>
<TE>   "He showed why he's one of the best players to ever play the
game," said Mirnyi, who had never faced Agassi before Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Said Agassi, appearing touched: "It's a pretty humbling
compliment. It's a bit of an overwhelming statement and I appreciate
the respect. You have to come out and prove you're the best every
day."</TE>
<TE>   He will be attempting to win his third title here, and add a
fourth championship to his collection in 2002. Agassi, who has won at
Scottsdale, Ariz., Miami and Rome this year, has lost one set in
three rounds here, to Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil in Friday's
quarterfinal.</TE>
<TE>   This was Agassi's first event since losing in the second round at
Wimbledon, and his performance here has answered some questions in
his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "It's less about winning and being in the final and more about how
I've done it," he said. "I've [faced] a nice variety that's tested
many aspects of my game and a lot has come together this week."</TE>
<TE>   Gambill will be a familiar opponent. Agassi leads their series,
7-2, and has not lost to him since 1999, winning their last four
meetings in straight sets.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be a good one," Agassi said. "The important thing for
me is to control the match, control the points. There won't be a lot
of mystery. We've played each other enough."</TE>
<TE>   Gambill, who has reached three semifinals in 2002, will be trying
to win his third career title and first since 2001, hoping this event
will serve as a springboard for the summer hard-court season.</TE>
<TE>   Beating Roddick was a major step forward. Gambill helped himself
take control of the match in the first set by moving back behind the
baseline to return serve. It wasn't the easiest decision.</TE>
<TE>   "He was playing very good tennis in that first set," Gambill said.
"If he continued to serve that out, that's just too good. I backed
up. You try not to get a little bit bullheaded and just stand on the
baseline and try and duke it out. Against Andy Roddick you can't do
that. He's just too good."</TE>
<TE>   As for Roddick, he was going to keep firing away with his
forehand, despite the near-misses. There was no second option.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always there in my mind," Roddick said. "It's just a day.
I've been hitting forehand winners for the past four days, and
everyone is talking about the greatest forehand in the world. And I
miss a couple today, and it's all of a sudden, 'Do you think you
should not pull the trigger?' No, I'm gonna pull the trigger. If I
pull back, it's not going to win tournaments."</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Roddick was visibly upset about an overrule on his
serve late in the first set.</TE>
<TE>   "Just a disagreement," he said. "If [the chair umpire] thinks he
can see a 130[-mph] serve 100%, that's his deal. I just questioned
that. I still think in my last game, the bigger part, besides that,
was the fact I missed two forehands."</TE>
<TE>   Gambill's on-court composure evaporated when he entered the
interview room. Angry over a passing mention in Saturday's paper, he
unleashed a verbal attack on a Times columnist, twice using the word
"witch." An ATP communications director helped defuse the situation,
calming Gambill down.</TE>

<LD>Lauren Jackson scored 25 points and Sue Bird added 21 for the Seattle
Storm, which overcame a career-high 32 points by Chamique Holdsclaw
to beat the Eastern Conference-leading Washington Mystics, 80-71, on
Saturday before 18,311 at Washington.</LD>
<LD>   The Storm beat the Mystics for the first time in four meetings.</LD>
<LD>   Holdsclaw, who had 11 rebounds, rejoined Washington after sitting
out nine games because of a left ankle sprain she suffered June 28.
Washington, which has lost three consecutive and four of five, was
5-4 in her absence.</LD>
<TE>   Seattle trailed, 66-59, when Bird made a three-pointer with 4:45
left in the game, starting a 12-0 run.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson tied the score with 4:04 remaining, converting an
offensive rebound, and Bird gave the Storm the lead for good on a
three-pointer with 3:18 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Portland 71, Miami 61--Tamicha Jackson scored 14 points and Sylvia
Crawley added 11 for the Fire, which ended a two-game losing streak
before 9,786 at Portland.</TE>
<TE>   DeMya Walker scored nine points and Alisa Burras added eight for
the Fire, which played a home game between a pair of three-game
trips.</TE>
<TE>   Sheri Sam led the Sol with 15 points, Betty Lennox added 12 and
Sandy Brondello had 11. Miami dropped to 0-2 on its five-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 79, Phoenix 64--Yolanda Griffith matched her season
high with 22 points and Ruthie Bolton added 20 for the Monarchs, who
forced the hosts into a season-high 23 turnovers in front of 9,344.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento won its third consecutive game and is 5-2 since
Griffith and point guard Ticha Penicheiro returned from the injured
list July 11. Griffith also had six rebounds. Kayte Christensen led
the Mercury with 10 points.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 74, Charlotte 66--Swin Cash had 20 points and 10 rebounds

<LD>I am extraordinarily touched by the bravery and tenacity of Elouise
Cobell's work on behalf of the Blackfoot people and other Native
Americans ("Truth and Consequences on the Reservation," by J. Michael
Kennedy, July 7). It is unimaginable that our country has been in
such denial over the mistreatment of indigenous people and that we
are guilty of such longstanding neglect of those who have lived in
this land for thousands of years. I cried as I read about Cobell's
being awarded a MacArthur Foundation award and then a Lannan grant
worth millions of dollars in order to pursue a lawsuit against the
Bureau of Indian Affairs. Cobell is a heroic warrior, one whose
efforts should be followed by the press regularly and held close to
our nation's heart. Only by coming clean and leaving denial behind,
and only by making sorely needed reparations to both Native Americans
and African Americans, will our country truly grow up. We must hold
ourselves accountable for our sins.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   love this country but mistrust its government. We took this
country away from the Indian nations, and it is morally wrong that we
do not live up to the "treaties" we signed with them. To mismanage
their affairs and steal from them is the bottom of moral depravity.
The U.S. government should apologize for the wrongs it did, reach an
equitable settlement with the Indian nations, let them manage their
own properties, and abolish the BIA.</TE>

<LD>As a psychologist who has dealt with ministers of many faiths who
have molested children and adolescents, I take grave issue with an
allegation made by A.W. Richard Sipe's wife, Marianne Benkert ("A
Voice Suddenly Heard," by Tony Perry, July 7): "There's a difference
between spirituality and the church as a bureaucracy. That's what we
want people to separate. The church bureaucracy is in trouble, but
spirituality remains strong."</LD>
<LD>   To many of us in the helping professions, this kind of
reasoning--"I am not responsible; it is my hand that did it, my body,
my emotions, my instincts or my past that is responsible" -- is
redolent. It is called rationalization, self-deception or mauvaise
foi (bad faith). Spiritual persons are spiritual exactly to the
degree that they act congruently with that spirituality. There can be
no "ethics" or "spirituality" in the heart of the SS storm trooper
who shoots an innocent and nudges him into the grave, but who does so
neatly and then crosses himself.</LD>

<LD>James Ricci and others had better think again about the issue of
Native American school mascots ("School Nicknames: Let There Be
Color," Metropolis, July 7). The issue is not about the Fighting
Irish, Conquistadors, Vikings or any other group. We're talking about
disrespectful images in non-Indian schools of the first Americans and
how they affect children of Indian heritage. This includes my
children. It was not an honor to have a caricature of a big-nosed
Indian painted inside our school gym. The schools can't go back and
change their sad display of racism. The damage has been done.</LD>

as well as my condolences.</TE>

<DH>It's Never Lonely in George N. Boone's Garden</DH>

<LD>There's always a crowd out back at the Boone house. They're a quiet
bunch, to be sure, but they have plenty to say for themselves
nevertheless. A bronze nymph reclines by the pool, a steel gymnast
balances near a hedge. Across the yard, a ceramic dog waits-perhaps for
art lover George N. Boone, who relishes coming home to the nearly 50
pieces in what he calls his 'Boone Garden of Sculptures.' 'I want
sculptures that make my grandchildren, my children, my wife and I smile
when we walk by,' says Boone.</LD>
<LD>   Boone's affection for sculpture dates to his youth, when his
grandfather would take him to the Huntington Library, Art Collections and
Botanical Gardens in San Marino, and continued during a career in which
he 'sculpted mouths' as an orthodontist. In 1987, he purchased the bronze
likeness of a windswept girl by San Diego artist Mic Mead to adorn his
spacious San Gabriel Valley yard after his children had left home and
their swings and slides were dismantled. Next, 'I visualized putting one
behind the pool to make the garden prettier.'</LD>
<TE>   At some point, the outdoor contingent sort of took the place over.
'Once you get started, you don't know when to stop,' Boone says. 'Our
objective then was two or three or four [sculptures]. When we got two or
three or four, we saw five, six, seven and eight that we just couldn't
turn down. Now it's hard to find a place to put another sculpture.'
Along the way, Boone and his wife MaryLou became art patrons,
establishing the MaryLou and George Boone Gallery at the Huntington
Library; the Boone Children's Gallery, an interactive exhibit at the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art, where Boone is a trustee; and the Boone
Sculpture Garden at Pasadena City College. In Boone's personal at-home
garden museum, the artist 'lineup' ranges from lesser-known sculptors to
more established artists such as Jud Fine and Michael McMillen.</TE>
<TE>   As the garden evolved, Boone began to focus on showcasing emerging
talents when entertaining or hosting community activities at home. He
often finds candidates through word of mouth and small or out-of-the-way
galleries. Occasionally, an artist whose work Boone has commissioned will
recommend a fellow sculptor for consideration-and so his garden grows.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the al fresco setting, there are residence criteria: One
sculpture on display per artist, artists must be based in California, and
work must be tasteful. Boone loves to connect children with art and
allows young visitors to climb on the sturdier pieces. Styles on view
range from modern to abstract to contemporary, in media such as bronze,
corrugated steel, marble, stoneware, copper and aluminum.</TE>
<TE>   The hushed gregariousness out in the backyard seems to be infectious.
'We're noticing more sculptures in other people's gardens,' Boone says.</TE>

<LD>At the L.A. Department of Animal Services, a 'rescue' means any
field assignment-but animal control officer Armando J. Navarrette is the
guy they call for the hairier situations. Home base for Navarrette is the
large new shelter in South-Central, where L.A.'s stray crisis is at its
worst. Colleagues call him a 'humane-iac,' but he's really just an unsung
hero with a heart of gold.</LD>
<LD>   How did you get involved in animal rescue?</LD>
<LD>   We always had pets when I was a kid, and I rescued strays whenever I
saw them. That evolved into serving as an [unpaid] reserve humane officer
for the city of Los Angeles. I worked in a bank at the time.</LD>
<TE>   Were you going the extra mile right from the start?</TE>
<TE>   During my training, I was working with an officer who was huge. We got
a call for a dog that was trapped under a house, but he was too big to
get under there. So I did it because I fit. Ever since then, people knew
that I'd do just about anything to save an animal. I have a passion for
it.</TE>
<TE>   Tell us about your toughest rescue.</TE>
<TE>   A month ago, we [could hear] a kitten under a house, but couldn't
locate her. I spent nearly five hours under the house, and her cries were
getting weaker. My spotter [animal-care technician] suggested that she
was trapped between the walls, so we cut three holes and she crawled out.
[The L.A. nonprofit group] Kitten Rescue is now fostering her. Her name?
Wallie!</TE>
<TE>   This stuff sounds a little dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   My scariest rescue took place at night, without a spotter, and without
proper equipment [helmet, pads, safety glasses].A pit bull had fallen
into an 8-foot hole underneath a house. I crawled down to get him out.
Once he was out, I had trouble getting out myself and almost panicked.
I'm smarter now.</TE>
<TE>   What makes you go that extra mile?</TE>
<TE>   If an animal is in peril, it's the result of a person who either beat
them, neglected them, didn't spay or neuter them, or just stopped caring
about them. I want to be the opposite kind of person. Just about every
day, someone calls me a 'humane-iac' or says I love animals more than I
love people, [but] I wear that as a badge of honor because it means I'm
doing the most important job in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Tell us about your own pets.</TE>
<TE>   To be honest, I only have a couple of goldfish. But there's an
important lesson here. I am not allowed to have them where I live. People
should only take on this responsibility when they are able to. When I buy
a home, then I'll have a lot of pets. In the meantime, I spend time
taking our shelter dogs for walks, helping to give them a little
emotional rehab.</TE>

<LD>A disco inferno raged through the chaparral last month on 'K-BIG
104's Disco Fever' night at the Hollywood Bowl. John Travolta himself
kicked off the 'Saturday Night Fever' 25th anniversary celebration in a
recorded message played on a stage-wide big screen. Performing under a
giant disco ball, Village People, Chic, and Kool &amp; the Gang electrified
the summer night with classics such as 'YMCA' and 'Le Freak.' About
16,000 guests, many dressed in their finest polyester and platforms,
hustled to the hits and watched clips from the '70s dance flick between
musical sets. We asked some of the partygoers why the kaleidoscopic
decade is stayin' alive in their hearts.</LD>

<LD>There aren't any Romulans, Wookies, or diminutive hairless
creatures trying to phone home at the International Space University
summer session, but the turnout from this solar system is pretty
impressive. At Cal Poly Pomona through Aug. 31, about 100 students and
professionals from 30 countries are in orbit for two months of
interstellar brainstorming under the tutelage of distinguished teachers
and guest lecturers from around the world.</LD>
<LD>   A group of MIT grad students put together the first ISU summer session
in 1988 as a forum for space-related disciplines such as biology,
chemistry, engineering, policy, business, information technology, law and
medicine. The conference was a step forward for a still-nascent field in
which exploration and research were largely nationalistic endeavors.
'From the beginning [ISU] has been based on the ideal of the exploration
of space for the betterment of humanity,' says Morla Milne, assistant
director of the ISU summer session.</LD>
<LD>   That first conference spawned a private institution with a permanent
campus in Strasbourg, France, offering a graduate program in space
studies, and a summer session held in a different city each year. At the
2000 summer session in Valparaiso, Chile, for example, participants
helped Chile develop its own space agency.</LD>
<TE>   ISU sponsors include NASA, the European Space Agency and the National
Space Development Agency of Japan, as well as large corporations in North
America, Europe and Japan, Milne says. About 1,800 ISU alums from 80
countries now make up 1% of the global space research and business
communities, she says.</TE>
<TE>   The first portion of this year's session is reserved for core
lectures, while the schedule for later weeks splits students into teams
for projects in astrobiology (the search for life forms beyond Earth) and

<LD>When Bob and Lucy Severson of La Verne decided to add a little
excitement to their manicured suburban world, the happy result was Kactus
Kountry ('Est. 1991'), the authentic three-quarter-scale frontier town
they built in their backyard.</LD>
<LD>   The couple had considered installing a swing set for their
granddaughter. But when Bob fashioned a toolshed with an
outhouse-inspired crescent moon on the door, Lucy was inspired. 'I said,
'We can make a town out of the Old West," she recalls. Bob sketched the
plans and used surplus material to build a hamlet complete with a church,
a bank, a saloon, a barn, a blacksmith shop, a jail and 'Lucy's General
Store.'</LD>
<LD>    Kactus Kountry might give the designers at Disney a run for their
money. St. Gregory Church (named for the Seversons' son) features a
steeple, a belfry and a bell. The stained-glass windows and altar within
are complemented by a spectacular chandelier, which Bob bought for 5
cents at a yard sale. At the saloon, the dance hall girl behind the
swinging doors is a life-sized doll of former British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher. High above the rusty barbed wire and the dusty wooden
boardwalk, a string of Christmas tree lights and lanterns give Kactus
Kountry an eerie glow at night.</LD>
<TE>   The town sign lists an ever-growing 'Kritter Population' of faux
animals arrayed near a real tortoise living in a doghouse on the
premises. 'This is what a silly old man can do with time on his hands,'
says Bob, 68. Kactus Kountry has hosted one school field trip, but
generally the Seversons use the town only to entertain. 'It's a party
house,' Bob says, pointing to 'Bob's Whiskey Wagon,' a miniature
Conestoga wagon with a giant tub for ice and drinks.</TE>
<TE>   Kactus Kountry may be the last refuge for the Seversons, who say they
were banned from the local Christmas decorating contest after their house
took first place three years in a row in the '70s. But Kactus Kountry
won't succumb to excess, they promise. 'We're already too cluttered,'
says Bob. 'Kmart just loved us for years,' Lucy says. 'But we're real
selective now.'</TE>

<HD>Craftsman With a Capital C</HD>
<DH>Brian McNally's Glasswork Celebrates the William Morris Style</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GINNY CHIEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For glass artist Brian McNally, 'Craftsman' is a proper noun. For
the past 30 years, the Santa Barbara resident has been creating
decorative pieces that faithfully adhere to the Arts and Crafts
movement's fundamental principles of high-quality workmanship and solid
design.</LD>
<LD>   'There's a look to Craftsman-style glass that just calls to you,' says
McNally. He lives in a Tudor bungalow appointed with a central arched
hearth and turn-of-the-century furniture and toils by day in his outdoor
studio. 'The warmth of the color and the light that emanates through a
piece of opalescent glass brings a certain peace to me.' This keen
affinity for the aesthetic of William Morris and Gustav Stickley attracts
discriminating clients from across the country who commission McNally's
lampshades, door panels, skylights and other glass accents for Arts and
Crafts bungalow restorations and decorating schemes.</LD>
<LD>   Each of McNally's one-of-a-kind designs begins with a detailed drawing
that evolves into a pattern, which he transfers onto hand-rolled glass.
The process often involves extensive research, whether it's delving into
the archives of Santa Barbara's Museum of Natural History to perfectly
replicate Chinese magnolia petals or gathering gingko leaves to better
choose between varying shades of green. A single lampshade can take
McNally several weeks to build.</LD>
<TE>   It's a painstaking approach that he relishes. 'I think we all need a
little bit of the Craftsman ideal in our lives as opposed to the plastic
throwaway culture that seems to dominate Southern California,' says
McNally, who also collects antique glass lampshades and art pottery from
the Craftsman period. 'I have no patience for the junky craftsmanship
that's put into a lot of stuff nowadays.'</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with the philosophy of the Arts and Crafts movement, which
blossomed in England during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in
reaction to the dehumanizing effects of the Industrial Revolution, most
of McNally's work features an earthy motif such as trees or flowers. His
style is also reminiscent of Art Nouveau glass master Louis Comfort
Tiffany, whom McNally admires for his use of bold colors and refined
materials. 'Mr. Tiffany is the granddaddy of glass artists,' says
McNally, who earned a master's degree in glass blowing from UCLA in 1972
(the degree is no longer offered).</TE>
<TE>   McNally, 54, developed an eye for Craftsman art while growing up in
the San Joaquin Valley. 'I had the good fortune of being around family
members who had these objects in their homes,' he says. However, it was
the women in his life who proved to be the biggest influences. His
mother, who studied art in college, died at the age of 27, and his
grandmother shared her portfolio with McNally years later when he
expressed an interest in becoming an artist. 'That was a wonderful thing
for my grandmother to do,' he says. 'Seeing those works from my mother
really inspired me to  pursue something creative.' Brian McNally, (805)

<LD>A HOT DAY IN TIJUANA IS COOLING INTO A GOLDEN SUNSET. BUSINESSWOMAN
Guadalupe Gonzalez is helping a customer select the perfect floral teacup
from a china showroom that is a fantasia of fine figurines. Delicate
swallowtail butterflies rest on china daisies. Mermaids hold out conch
shells with tiny freshwater pearls. Porcelain brides and grooms painted
in reassuring pastels gaze at each other with bland expressions of
matrimonial joy.</LD>
<LD>   The elegant breakables in the tall glass cases seem too fragile for
the tale that Gonzalez is telling. It is the story of her daughter
Angelica's first marriage. And it was anything but bland.</LD>
<LD>   Angelica Bustamante is the granddaughter of Alfonso Bustamante,
Tijuana's Rockefeller, the border pioneer who built the twin business
towers that loom over this boomtown. Her path seemed preordained: an
adolescence consumed with long days at the Tijuana Country Club, the
possibility of college in San Diego, and marriage to another young scion
of Tijuana's ruling class.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, when Angelica was 16, she tearfully revealed to her mother
that she was pregnant. Her suitor was a rakish 19-year-old unknown with
bedroom eyes and a crooked smile, a man known as "Kitty" to his friends.
Like Angelica, Kitty partied with a popular crowd of teenagers who
studied at the Instituto Mexico, one of Tijuana's exclusive private
schools. They were hastily married not long before the birth of their
twins in 1988. And that was merely the first chapter in a life never
imagined by Angelica's parents.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2001, Arturo "Kitty" Paez, 34, became the first accused
lieutenant of the Tijuana drug cartel to be extradited to the United
States for cocaine trafficking. U.S. prosecutors say he worked for the
notorious Arellano Felix brothers: Benjamin, described by law enforcement
authorities as the cartel's chief executive, and Ramon, considered the
"enforcer," the man who planned the murders of the cartel's enemies.
Authorities on both sides of the border believe the organization was
responsible for shipping billions of dollars of cocaine into the United
States over the last decade. Benjamin Arellano Felix is currently housed
in a high-security prison near Mexico City, awaiting trial on
drug-trafficking charges. Ramon was shot to death by Mexican police in
February.</TE>
<TE>   Angelica wasn't the only well-to-do Tijuanan to bring a reputed
trafficker into the family. In 1986, Ruth Serrano Corona, the
granddaughter of a top federal official in Tijuana, married Benjamin
Arellano Felix. Ruth was with Benjamin in March when soldiers barged into
their house in Puebla and took him away.</TE>
<TE>   And consider the saga of Lina Literas, one of Angelica's best friends,
a beautiful young woman whose father's chain of border import stores
supplied much of the crystal that graces the tables of Tijuana's elite.
After a childhood of ballet lessons and society weddings, Lina married
the baby-faced son of a courtly Tijuana colonel who had been a
presidential guardsman. Emilio Valdez Mainero seemed an appropriately
upper-tier husband, but he too allegedly found employment in the Arellano
Felix organization, recruiting 'young assassins who belong to Tijuana's
upper class'-some of them his childhood friends.  Emilio ended up in a
U.S prison, convicted of drug trafficking in 1998. Lina disappeared
during the 2000 Thanksgiving weekend and turned up dead.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez shakes her head. "So many kids from society got involved with
them," she sighs. "All the ladies my age, we all say that's the worst
cancer to ever hit Tijuana." That cancer was the cartel.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Ramon was killed in Mazatlan in February, at least 25
young Tijuanans from established families had been killed or jailed in a
15-year period, all because of their connection to the cartel. They were
graduates of the finest private schools, at home on both sides of the
border, the children of families that knew or were related to some of the
most powerful people in Baja California.</TE>
<TE>   Their fate poses an uncomfortable question for this cosmopolitan
border city: How did a bunch of kids from Tijuana's wealthiest
neighborhoods get mixed up with some of the deadliest men in the
hemisphere?</TE>
<TE>   TIJUANA IS THE MEXICAN CITY OF REINVENTION. IN THE LAST 50 YEARS IT
has been transformed from a dusty backwater of 65,000 to an electric
border boomtown whose official population tops 1 million, though many
believe it is twice that size. As in Los Angeles, the past is not taken
quite so literally. Once people move to Tijuana, they are pretty much
whoever they say they are.</TE>
<TE>   Many people who come to this freewheeling experiment in urbanism shed
the reserve and formality of central Mexico. Tijuana citizens have
acquired a reputation for being extroverted, unpretentious and
open-minded. A large middle class feeds a pulsing youth culture of
crowded discos and hip rock bands.</TE>
<TE>   Upper-class circles are as newly minted as the modern Tijuana Country
Club, built in 1948 on the grounds of the old casino, a remnant of the
time that the city was a Prohibition getaway for Hollywood movie stars.
Families with such names as Bustamante, Fimbres and Anchondo coalesced
into tight-knit circles that formed the core of Tijuana society.</TE>
<TE>   But by the mid-1980s, even this reliable terrain began to shift. The
devalued Mexican peso was relegating some upper class Tijuana families to
the middle class. A new, cash-rich generation of drug traffickers was
jostling for control of Tijuana; they took advantage of police and
government corruption, and of the city's strategic location at the
doorstep of the world's largest narcotics market. The Arellano Felix
brothers did that and more-they exploited one of Tijuana's treasures: its
youth.</TE>
<TE>   To Dario Garin, the president of the Tijuana Country Club, the
Arellano Felixes' allure boiled down to two simple things: Money. "And
power," Garin says with a wry, world-weary air. "They have lots of money.
And they go around spreading it everywhere. "I believe it was the
Arellanos' strategy to infiltrate the young so they could establish
themselves in society."</TE>
<TE>   THE ARELLANO FELIXES, A PROSPEROUS FAMILY OF SEVEN BROTHERS AND FOUR
sisters, were from Sinaloa, the Pacific Coast birthplace of many Mexican
drug traffickers. Mexican police say some of the brothers were the
proteges of a well-connected relative, the Sinaloa drug kinpin Miguel
Angel Felix Gallardo, who was jailed in 1989 in connection with the
murder of U.S. DEA agent Enrique Camarena.</TE>
<TE>   At first, no one on either side of the border took much notice when
some of the brothers drifted into Tijuana in the early 1980s. They seemed
small-time. In 1980, Francisco Arellano Felix, owner of a Mazatlan disco,
failed to appear in a San Diego court to answer charges of selling half a
kilo of cocaine. Drug Enforcement Administration officials say Benjamin
Arellano Felix first appeared on the radar for a petty 1982 drug arrest
in Montebello; he was with his former wife and brother Eduardo. The
brothers skipped bond and returned to Mexico. It was around that time
that Benjamin began coming to church with one of the prettiest girls in
town.</TE>
<TE>   Father Gerardo Montano says he was first introduced to Benjamin by
Ruth Serrano Corona, a striking blond in her early 20s who was very
devout and very proper, when he was parish priest at San Francisco Javier
church. He says her  stepfather owned an elegant Tijuana restaurant and
her grandfather had been head of immigration and a political party chief.</TE>
<TE>   Like more than a few well-connected Tijuanans, Ruth was born in San
Diego County. She had volunteered at the church since she was 16, reading
Scripture at services and carrying the wine, chalice and water. Her new
boyfriend was "a very polite young man, and very much in love with Ruth,"
says Montano. Benjamin, the priest adds, said he was a contractor.</TE>
<TE>   But Tijuana's upstart investigative newsweekly, Zeta, identified
Benjamin and Ramon Arellano in 1985 as the mysterious men behind a
marijuana warehouse guarded by municipal police. And by the following
year, Benjamin had enough notoriety in certain circles that he raised
eyebrows when he and Ruth arrived at the "Miss Mexico" pageant in Tijuana
and were shown to a VIP area usually reserved for business sponsors and
their friends.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth gave birth to their first child-also named Ruth-in San Diego a
year later, and Montano baptized her. "I never saw anything strange about
them in the religious meetings," the priest says. "They wore gala attire.
Benjamin was very well-mannered, very cultivated and gracious, always
very gracious."</TE>
<TE>   If Father Montano was in denial, he wasn't alone.</TE>
<TE>   Benjamin opened a nice seafood restaurant in town. He would sit at
nearby Sanborn's cafe on Avenida Revolucion, poring over his ledger
books, wearing a distinctive white linen suit and carrying an executive
attache case. He offered businessmen generous credit to tide them through
the tight economy. Perhaps they were grateful enough to ignore the fact
that Benjamin had begun to move about with an armed security detail, rare
for an ordinary entrepreneur.</TE>
<TE>   CRISTINA PALACIOS DE HODOYAN OPENS THE DOOR TO A FOYER FILLED WITH a
large doll collection and other touches of the decorative juvenilia that
adults somtimes use to reinforce a sense of innocence. She is the mother
of Alfredo Hodoyan, 31, the childhood friend of Emilio who is accused of
taking part, at the behest of the cartel, in the spectacular gangland
slaying of Baja California's federal police commander in September 1996.
Cristina, 62, rolls her eyes dismissively at any suggestion that Alfredo
was the killer, the "Wolf" described by prosecutors. Not Alfredo-tall,
good-looking, bilingual, U.S.-born; a graduate of the prestigious St.
Augustine Academy in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   She shakes her head. Alfredo was openhearted, generous- wasn't he
always issuing invitations to play basketball at the Hodoyans' hoop? And
Emilio-Did you know his father was the cousin of a Mexican
president?-lived right around the corner.</TE>
<TE>   So did skinny little Fabian Martinez, who was so shy that his father,
a respected pediatrician, organized a baseball team so his son would have
children to play with. It's hard to believe Fabian grew into "the Shark,"
alleged by Mexican police to have killed at least a dozen people on
behalf of the cartel.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said terrible things about other neighborhood boys, too.
Boys whose parents Cristina knows from school PTAs. Boys who played with
Cristina's sons at the Tijuana Country Club years ago. Those were simpler
times.</TE>
<TE>   They began to change around 1985, when Cristina picked up her daughter
at a rock concert and was introduced to a flamboyant teenager with flashy
gold chains on his wrists and a big gold medallion around his neck. He
was Ramon Arellano Felix, the blue-jeaned kid brother of a big family new
to Tijuana. "No one knew who they were," Cristina says. But soon all the
teenagers knew Benjamin's kid brother, 12 years his junior. Ramon roared
through the streets on a motorcycle, wearing splashy Versace shirts,
black leather pants and an easy smile. Cristina's older son, Agustin
Hodoyan, would wave when Ramon drove by in a red sports car,
rock-and-roll booming from his stereo. Once, Agustin served as a
translator for Ramon and an attractive young American at a party given by
Lina Literas' boyfriend, Emilio. "How could you not know him?" Agustin
asked after Alfredo's arrest in 1996. "He was a party boy. Every Friday
or Saturday night he would be at a party or a disco. He was fun."</TE>
<TE>   But "I never wanted to ask him for a favor," Agustin said, "because
nothing is free." Not everybody had those reservations.</TE>
<TE>   Ramon's habit of treating everyone to champagne endeared him to the
Instituto set. His manic charisma drew the admiration of kids such as
Emilio Valdez Mainero, the kind of young men who are known in Mexico by a
not entirely flattering term: "juniors." Eventually Ramon's friends would
be tagged by the press as "narcojuniors."</TE>
<TE>   People whispered about what Ramon and his brothers did. But in those
days, explains one self-described "narcojunior" who is now a protected
witness, "the guys with the nicest cars and girls were the drug dealers.
This is happening at an age where that stuff is very important to you."</TE>
<TE>   Judging from U.S. court files, Ramon's Rat Pack also knew he was not
the most predictable party guest.</TE>
<TE>   According to those same documents, Emilio and Ramon were attending a
birthday party at Tijuana's Club Britania in late 1988 when an unwelcome
guest arrived. The young man had just run off for three weeks with
Ramon's sister. Ramon walked out of the crowded party and shot and killed
his sister's boyfriend and two friends parked outside.</TE>
<TE>   "If he got drunk or started using, you didn't even want to be around
him," the protected witness says. But if being an enemy was dangerous,
being a member of his entourage could be a rush. Kids admired his long
hair, his rococo Chinese dragon bedside lamps, and the respect and fear
he inspired.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unbelievable the power you feel," the witness says. "You have no
rules. You're young. You have women all over the place. It's like this
big adult playground. It was a very unique time of my life."</TE>
<TE>   IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER ANGELICA BUSTAMANTE AND LINA LITERAS KNEW exactly
what they were getting into when they started going to the kind of
parties where the bad-boy charms of Emilio Valdez Mainero and Kitty Paez
were drawing sultry glances from teenage girls. Angelica belonged to a
sheltered, well-chaperoned world of weddings and baptisms. But Kitty,
with his jeans, T-shirts and irresistable grin, was considered the
coolest guy in his Instituto clique. He had a nice car, his own place,
money, and a lot more independence than his peers. Friends say that when
he dropped by the Instituto one day to pick up some seniors, Angelica was
thrilled to be noticed.</TE>
<TE>   "He was cute, he was charming, he was very athletic, and he had all
the girls crazy," a former schoolmate of Angelica's says. "Girls always
want to be with the guy who has all the girls crazy."</TE>
<TE>   That did not qualify Paez as a suitable fiance for the daughter of the
president of the Tijuana Convention and Visitors Bureau. Officially,
Kitty owned a liquor store in Rosarito. But how had a penniless
19-year-old come up with the money for a liquor license? "Kitty Paez? I'd
never heard of him," Gonzalez says. "It would have been fine with me if
they hadn't gotten married at all. But it wouldn't have mattered. She
would have kept seeing him. When her father found out she was expecting
twins, he said, 'She's getting married.' " Then-Tijuana Mayor Federico
Valdes said he officiated at the wedding.</TE>
<TE>   Lina was a far savvier player in the social scene. "Lina was
gorgeous," her brother Jaime says. "She has always had many admirers. She
was the perfect girl." Her mother tried to discourage her romance with
the swaggering Emilio. But when Lina became pregnant, her family
reluctantly consented to their marriage, a relative says. "She was very
young. He was very handsome," another mother says. Court documents say
Ramon was named godfather of their son, Emilio Alfredo, in 1991, though
relatives say he didn't show up for the baptism. ("These people have
last-minute commitments and problems," one relative says. "They're like
doctors. Their beeper goes off and they have to go.") An invitation that
found its way into U.S. court files directed the juniors to a splashy
post-baptism disco party hosted by Ramon and the baby's other godfather,
Kitty Paez. "Ramon became the godfather of a number of children in
Tijuana," Cristina de Hodoyan said in 1996. "Let's face it, it was often
for the money. He would pay for a big baptism party."</TE>
<TE>   The Arellano Felixes and their entourage became "the beautiful people,
the 90210 of drug cartels," says Gonzalo Curiel, the assistant U.S.
attorney assigned to the case. "The Arellanos and the narcojuniors were
celebrities."</TE>
<TE>   But the new godfathers and their friends presented a social quandary.
Grandparents rolled their eyes when ostentatious gifts from the
godfathers arrived at children's birthday parties. The Arellano Felix
brothers might be the life of the disco scene, but some established
families did not care to be this intimately associated with them. "They
would tolerate [Benjamin] at times, if it was a party at somebody's ranch
outside of the city. But mostly Benjamin would have his own parties, and
the juniors would show up with their girlfriends," the protected witness
says.</TE>
<TE>   WHATEVER RELATIONSHIP THE ARELLANO FELIXES HAD WITH TIJUANA SOCIety
was irreparably damaged on May 24, 1993, when Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas
Ocampo, the archbishop of Guadalajara, was shot to death at the
Guadalajara airport-a killing that shocked the deeply Catholic nation.
Mexican authorities believed that gunmen led by Ramon Arellano Felix
mistook the archbishop's car for that of a rival druglord, Joaquin "El
Chapo" Guzman. The gothic twists and turns of this feud had already
resulted in the deaths of six people at a Puerto Vallarta disco in 1992
(Ramon escaped through an air-conditioning duct in the bathroom) and
prompted an Arellano Felix associate to have someone seduce and kill the
estranged wife of a rival drug lord, push her children off a bridge and
send her head to her husband, Mexican authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   After the archbishop's killing, Ramon and Benjamin were no longer
enigmas but front-page headlines-Mexico's most wanted fugitives. Father
Montano says he was not the only one who was stunned to discover that the
Arellanos were drug traffickers. "It was a surprise to a lot of people in
Tijuana who had dealings with them without knowing what they did,"
Montano says. Ruth went to work on her husband's behalf. She called,
Montano says, and begged the priest to deliver a letter to the pope
explaining the Arellano Felixes' "innocence." "Father, I'm asking this of
you because I trust you," Ruth implored, and, according to the priest, "I
didn't even think about the fact that she was the wife of a fugitive."</TE>
<TE>   Ramon met the priest at a busy Mexico City cafe in December 1993 and
they drove to the papal nunciate for Ramon's three-hour private audience
with the nuncio. At midnight, Montano says, the nuncio went to speak with
then-president Carlos Salinas: Ramon wanted to meet with him, too. That
meeting was denied. The nuncio blessed Ramon, and they left. The priest
says he repeated the rendezvous with Benjamin in January 1994. He never
considered turning the brothers in "because this was a matter of
conscience. My work as a priest is one thing, but to act as an authority
is another."</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the Arellano Felixes were on the lam. Mexico City sent
authorities to ransack the Hodoyans' house, and houses belonging to
Emilio, Kitty, Benjamin and Ramon were seized. Authorities managed to
swoop in and arrest Francisco Arellano Felix in 1993 in Tijuana's tony
Chapultapec hills. In March 1994, Mexico City federal police flew into
Tijuana again and handcuffed Javier Arellano Felix, a little brother with
a campy nom de narco, "the Little Tiger." Tijuana police were curiously
unhelpful: Javier's state police bodyguards opened fire and spirited
Javier to freedom, leaving a federal police commander and four others
dead.</TE>
<TE>   Ramon and Benjamin retreated to gated beach houses south of Rosarito,
according to the protected witness, where Ramon's appetite for cocaine
and his "huge steriod rages" made him increasingly unpredictable. One day
the witness was surfing at an Arellano Felix beach house while Ramon
relaxed in his bedroom. Looking up, "I see Ramon sitting there with a
scope, like an M-16, pointing at us surfing," the witness says. "Like he
was going to scare us, or [was] joking around. I went 'Hey what's going
on.' He's like, 'I'm just sitting here.' But I could see him with the
tripod pointing with his scope. I thought [forget] that, and got off the
beach. I knew about his rages." By then, he says, "Ramon was just muscle.
He was a killer idiot."</TE>
<TE>   By the time Ramon joined the list of FBI's Most Wanted in 1997, Ruth
was in San Diego, immersed in a life of intense suburban normalcy-except
for the DEA crew trailing her family. Angelica moved to San Diego, too,
but Kitty remained close to his family, and the couple vacationed
together in Cancun with the families of other juniors and some Tijuana
businessmen. Other wives, like Lina Literas, hunkered down and became one
of the boys-but she was not crazy about Ramon. One night, Ramon invited
Emilio out to romance some beautiful women, and Lina snapped: "Shut up
Ramon." "Emilio worried about it," a relative says. "He said, 'Don't talk
to Ramon that way.' Because Ramon did not forgive." Lina told her family:
"I'm afraid of him. He's really crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Ramon's narcojuniors now had a much higher profile in Tijuana, and
they were drawing scrutiny for a spate of gangland murders that would
include eight senior prosecutors from Baja in a single year. A new
federal police commander, Ernesto Ibarra Santes, put down his bags in
Tijuana in August 1996 and promised a "revolution" against the Tijuana
drug cartel. He named Emilio on national television. After 28 days on the
job, Ibarra was shot to death Sept. 14, 1996, outside the Mexico City
airport. Authorities rounded up two suspects Sept. 30 in a luxury
apartment in San Diego's picturesque Coronado Shores. They were Emilio
Valdez Mainero and Alfredo Hodoyan.</TE>
<TE>   After a long period of few consequences, the narcojuniors were about
to discover that U.S. prosecutors couldn't care less about their fathers,
wives, friends or family connections.  And the parents of these rebels
without a cause found themselves the subject of unwelcome scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "I am an honest, decent family woman who has spent my life completely
dedicated to my husband and children. This has been a terrible blow,"
said Amparo de Valdez, Emilio's aging mother, who died last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I know Alfredo is innocent," Cristina Hodoyan said at the time.
"These boys are from good families, known to all of Tijuana. Everyone who
lives here has the money to give their children opportunities, cars,
private schooling, clothes, an allowance. If Alfredo said, 'Mama, I need
a car,' I got him a car. I still pay for his gas. If he is broke, I pay
his credit card bill.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would they be mixed up in this?"</TE>
<TE>   A few months after his son's arrest in 1996, Alejandro Hodoyan pointed
out that Alfredo wasn't the only one in Tijuana rubbing shoulders with
the Arellano Felixes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think 90% of the kids who went to discos knew them by sight,"
Alejandro said. "They saw them involved in an illicit business, yet
roaming around free, getting all the French champagne and good-looking
girls, and they said, 'Hey, why can't I be part of this elite?' "</TE>
<TE>   "I knew [Alfredo] was with them," Alejandro said. "He felt very brave
strutting around with them. I don't think he was involved in killing
people," he said. "But he probably would have been. You have to prove
your loyalty. To do that, you have to kill someone."</TE>
<TE>   REPUTATIONS WEREN'T THE only things damaged.</TE>
<TE>   Alfredo Hodoyan's older brother, Alex, was invited to join the U.S.
Witness Protection Program in exchange for his testimony against the
cartel. His mother says a federal police commander pulled Alex out of her
car in 1997 and the family hasn't seen him since. U.S. officials say the
cartel executed him. Alfredo was extradited from San Diego to Mexico in
1999 to face charges in the Ibarra murder and is awaiting a judgment in
his case.</TE>
<TE>   ~ Emilio was convicted of orchestrating drug shipments from behind
bars in San Diego in 1998. As his legal woes deepened, Emilio complained
to a relative that his wife Lina was receiving "not a cent" from Ramon
Arellano. "That worried Emilio a lot," the relative says. "Emilio said,
'If they're not helping her, they must think I betrayed them.' It made
him think they viewed him as an enemy."</TE>
<TE>   Emilio got 30 years. But the chain of dark destinies did not end
there. Lina had filed for divorce when she brought their children to
visit Emilio at a California prison Nov. 20, 2000, her family says. Lina
returned to Tijuana the next day and disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Her body turned up four days later with the corpse of her married
boyfriend. Police told the family that he appeared to have been tortured
in front of her. Emilio told her family "he won't rest until he finds out
what happened," a relative says.</TE>
<TE>   "She died with the person she loved, like a soap opera," her brother
Jaime says. "That gives us peace.</TE>
<TE>   Lina's father passed away four months later. Her mother is raising her
three grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The protected witness returned to the scene of an all-night drinking
session and found two hungover gunmen playing soccer with a ball that,
upon closer inspection, turned out to be a third gunman's head. Now he's
trying to sell his story to Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth Serrano Corona was with her husband Benjamin when Mexican
soldiers burst into their bedroom in March. Benjamin's personal assistant
turned out to be Manuelito Martinez, Fabian's brother. Fabian is presumed
dead.</TE>
<TE>   Kitty Paez was arrested by U.S. request in downtown Tijuana in 1997.
He and Angelica had been divorced for a year, her family says. Her family
says she has since remarried, but the San Diego Union-Tribune reported
that she showed up with the children at Kitty's sentencing hearing in
January as he choked back tears and apologized to "society in general"
for "everything I did." His freewheeling life was reduced to clinical
legal descriptions of meetings where Ramon plotted "violent acts" by
narcojuniors. Kitty was sentenced to 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   THERE ARE STILL SOCIETY KIDS WHO brag that they know two of the
younger Arellanos, Eduardo and Javier, who, some DEA officials believe,
are living under armed guard in Tijuana, trying to stave off competitors
and paying $1 million a week to police.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they'll fool them again," Tijuana Country Club
president Dario Garin said. "People have had the experience, and it was a
very bitter one. It won't be so easy now."</TE>
<TE>   But in March, another Tijuana "junior," Walter Ruiz Fimbres, 21,
turned up in Chicago newspapers, arrested in Deerfield, Ill., with a
carload of marijuana, and was slapped with a $10-million bond.</TE>
<TE>   And Tijuana discos are still prowled by charming strangers who seem
far too eager to buy drinks for the whole table.</TE>
<TE>   "History keeps repeating itself," Jaime Literas says. "They keep
meeting these people, in a party, at a disco, they buy bottles of
champagne, and they become the new members of the narco-society. It's the
same now: You go to a party, you meet these guys and you don't even know
their names, just pseudonyms. They have new cars and they invite the
girls to a disco and meet their cousins. Little by little, they get to
know a lot of people."</TE>

<DH>Long After Most of the Jazz Greats He Played With Have Faded,
Trumpeter Jack Sheldon Is Still at It-Blowing Sweet Sounds, Taking Horn
Lessons, 'Trying to Get Good'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE LOPEZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 30 years ago, I would come home from school and find my
mother watching the "Merv Griffin Show" on the Motorola while she did the
ironing. I loved it when Merv would call on the trumpet player in Mort
Lindsey's orchestra, a chubby-faced cut-up named Jack Sheldon, and goof
with him the way Johnny Carson later did with Doc Severinsen.</LD>
<LD>   I had no idea the orchestra wise guy was a serious horn player and one
of the creators of the so-called West Coast sound, or that he had swung
with Art Pepper, Benny Goodman, Zoot Sims and dozens of other jazz
greats. Nor did I have any idea, until Merv Griffin told me recently,
that Sheldon's buddy Chet Baker was often in the wings, waiting for the
show to wrap so that he and Sheldon could go high-balling across Southern
California in Baker's hot rod, cruising for cool gigs and hot girls.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the jazz giants Sheldon played with, like Baker, are long
gone, many having drunk or mainlined themselves to early graves. But
Sheldon is still around at 70, living in a funky Hollywood Hills bungalow
and often practicing trumpet while he wades in the backyard swimming
pool. By night, he plays small clubs around L.A, keeping a time and a
sound alive with his crooning, uninhibited comic riffs and a horn that
blows pure, sweet memory. The last of the hepcats.</LD>
<TE>   "Jack is definitely one of a kind," says Clint Eastwood, a Sheldon
buddy who has been known to drop in on his shows, only to be gently
abused by him between songs. "I took my wife to see him at a club in
Toluca Lake, and right away he starts in on me with 'Rawhide' and
'Bridges of Madison County.' 'Rowdy Yates is in the room.' "</TE>
<TE>   'Was it R-rated?' I asked Eastwood. Sheldon, in Rat Pack lounge
tradition, needles guests with exaggerated tales of sexual triumphs and
misadventures-theirs and his own. Sometimes it gets uncomfortably blunt,
if not raunchy.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Eastwood said, "and my wife is sitting there with me. But she
liked Jack right away. Los Angeles has a lot of great players, but I
don't know anyone who can do the comedy, the singing and the playing like
Jack. Playing technically well is one thing, but Jack gets a great sound
that a lot of players just don't get."</TE>
<TE>   I had forgotten all about Sheldon after his "Merv Griffin" days. Then
during the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, I caught him as featured guest with
the Louie Bellson Big Band in a tribute to music in the movies. It was a
hot summer night at L.A.'s Ford Amphitheatre, and Sheldon, resembling a
polar bear plopped onto a stool, kept mopping his brow between numbers.
At one point Sheldon started in on Clinton, building to a typically
deadpan line that destroyed the audience. "Anyone who could get a Jewish
girl from Brentwood to do that oughta be president."</TE>
<TE>   Moments later he was playing the soulful Johnny Mandel ballad "Emily"
with such feeling that it brought sighs. Sheldon had slid with ease from
Jackie Mason to Miles Davis, his rich, transforming tone a romantic
summer night meditation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a haunting trumpet he plays," Griffin says. "Henry Mancini once
told me, 'If I've got a couple making passionate love on screen and I'm
writing the score, it's Jack Sheldon's trumpet I want.' "</TE>
<TE>   At Sheldon's home one afternoon, I find truth in something Griffin had
told me. Jack doesn't let many people get too close. Even the sunlight is
draped out of his dim little bachelor pad, which is dominated by a grand
piano. On the kitchen table is the chlorine-corroded trumpet he plays
while practicing in the lap pool, and in the den are photos of Sheldon
with Burt Reynolds, Dizzy Gillespie and Sarah Vaughan. Taped to the
refrigerator is a fortune cookie promise: Everything will now come your
way.</TE>
<TE>   Sheldon sinks into a mushy sofa, trumpet within arm's reach, and
squirms a bit when I ask about family. His daughter was killed in a plane
crash in 1979. A decade later, his mother was hit and killed while
crossing a street in Hollywood. She and Sheldon had taught swimming at a
pool in Hollywood, with Jack helping give lessons to the children of
celebrities, who included Paul Newman and Nat King Cole. Sheldon also
lost a wife who got tired of his ways and finally walked out on him.</TE>
<TE>   "I was there for my family, but not emotionally," he says
confessionally. "I was always with the music."</TE>
<TE>   Griffin recalls consoling Sheldon after his daughter's death. "I got a
call on the show and had to go and tell Jack the bad news," says Griffin,
who believes Sheldon's losses have influenced both his haunting tone and
his onstage joie de vivre.</TE>
<TE>   During my visit to his home, Sheldon's mood changes instantly when he
grunts off the sofa and settles behind his piano to knock out a tune he's
written about Hollywood. He's performing now, free from everything, as if
it's the best painkiller available. "Me, me, me," he sings, beaming at
his creation as he hammers the keys. "The world revolves around me! I'd
like to be humble and good. I wish I could. But who's kidding whom?
Between me and you, it's gotta be me, me, me."</TE>
<TE>   Sheldon has played, sung, or acted in more than 70 movies and
television shows since 1958, and had his own sitcom, "Run Buddy Run," in
1966. In the '70s, that was Sheldon's crooning on Schoolhouse Rock's
"Conjunction Junction" and "I'm Just a Bill." Then there are his
contributions on roughly 200 albums and CDs. He played with Curtis
Counce, Stan Kenton, Peggy Lee, Herbie Mann, Mel Torme, George Shearing,
Lena Horne, Woody Herman, Diane Schuur, Rosemary Clooney, Frank Sinatra,
Shelly Manne, Nina Simone and Anita O'Day.   And then there was Chet, or
Chettie, as Sheldon calls his late friend Chet Baker, the James Dean of
American jazz. Sheldon, born in Florida, moved to Michigan with his
mother when his dad ran out, got hooked on music through his school band
and then settled in with his mother in California as a teen. He lived
near the original El Cholo and Baker lived in Palos Verdes, and they
hooked up at different clubs and became pals in their late teens.
"Chettie had an old '32 Ford and a big Cadillac, and he drove real fast.
We did crazy things, too, like go climbing the cliffs at Palos Verdes,
where we could have killed ourselves. We'd just go riding all over the
place, from Santa Barbara to San Diego, any nightclub we could find, and
we'd play for no money. We'd just walk in and say, 'Can we play?' "</TE>
<TE>   They were both young, lean, handsome and reckless in a carefree
California way. They would both sing and play, and then, to paraphrase
Sheldon, avail themselves of the prettiest women in every joint. "I was
mostly a drinker and Chet did the drugs, then he moved to New York and
got all screwed up," Sheldon says. "He played opposite Miles [Davis] and
that's where he got started on the heroin."</TE>
<TE>   When they could see straight, Sheldon and Baker developed subtle, cool
tones, in contrast to the sharper angles and wails of the East Coast
scene. It wasn't for the sake of creating a geographic distinction, says
Sheldon. "We just wanted to make the prettiest sound we could, every note
a gem."</TE>
<TE>   "Jack always thought he was second to Chet, but it some ways he was
even better," says deejay Helen Borgers of KLON-FM, a Long Beach jazz
station. "Jack's playing is sweeter and it swings a little more. He
wasn't responsible for changing any musical styles, but he was certainly
one of the great proponents of West Coast jazz. I wouldn't confine him to
that alone, though. He can play great bebop and swing, from Kenton's very
experimental stuff to Benny Goodman's sound."</TE>
<TE>   Early this year, I started dropping in on Sheldon's act at Jax in
Glendale and Miceli's in Hollywood. Jax is the place to see him, by the
way, because if Sheldon is a throwback, so is the Jax audience. The
regulars have as good a time as he does, and are aware that for all the
ham and the hepcat tales between numbers, Sheldon is a musician first. He
doesn't sing as well as he plays, but gets Louis Armstrong mileage out of
a lyric.</TE>
<TE>   "What a night!" Sheldon exclaims after crooning and blowing through "I
Love Paris" with a stepped-up, almost Latin beat laid down by his
drummer, bassist and pianist. The exclamation is ironic and
self-deprecating. Yes, what a night here in beautiful downtown Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   But it's honest, too. Rather than carp and moan about five decades of
toil landing him at a burger and beer joint on Brand Boulevard, so far
beyond cool that he's almost hip again, Sheldon is genuinely thrilled to
be onstage doing the only thing he's ever cared to do. In "I Love Paris,"
his crooning fades into a stream of French gibberish and a purring
come-on to a sultry, Chandleresque blond planted at the end of the bar.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it," says Sheldon, who beat cancer a few years back and starts
his days at AA meetings. He's a survivor, having overcome his own
weaknesses and having endured in a business that reduces so many
musicians into wretched compromise or total surrender. Wherever he plays,
he tells me, he makes it his Carnegie Hall. What-ifs and might-have-beens
are a disease, Sheldon says when I ask if he wonders where his career
might be if he'd devoted himself to just singing, comedy, or horn
playing. "I wouldn't want to give up any one thing."</TE>
<TE>   It's his trumpet, though, that classes up the act. Sheldon practices
for hours every day and still takes lessons, 55 years after first picking
up the horn. "You have to stay in shape or you lose it," says Sheldon.</TE>
<TE>   His teacher is Uan Rasey, who played that unforgettable trumpet in the
"Chinatown" theme song. Rasey is a legendary guru who is visited at his
hillside Studio City home by a number of great horn players, including
Arturo Sandoval. They call on Rasey to work out mechanical kinks or help
them find some spiritual breakthrough in their tone or expression.
Sheldon and Rasey go all the way back to "The Munsters" TV show, when
they stood side by side and recorded live tracks for every episode.</TE>
<TE>   "We talk about a commitment to a philosophical approach, the religion
of the music and the ethics of playing," says Rasey, who, at 80, has lost
the stamina to play but takes pride in helping others maintain it with
note-bending workouts and inspirational prodding. "The tone comes from
who you are, and Jack is a good-hearted person of great intellect. We
talk about how important life is, how important it is that you treat your
fellow man with respect, and how to play with a sense of thoughtfulness,
compassion and reverence for the act of making music."</TE>
<TE>   Onstage, Sheldon often disappears into himself while another band
member solos. He'll sit there squinting into a distant world, listening
to the chord changes, critiquing his own last solo and imagining the
next.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep trying to get good," Sheldon says, "and I get closer and
closer."</TE>

<DH>He Knew About Land Mines, Kalashnikovs and Secret Agents. But
Naseer Ahmed's Hardest Struggle Was to Explain Afghanistan and His People
to the Rest of the World.</DH>
<SE>This is one in an occasional series chronicling untold stories from the
war in Afghanistan.</SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The day I left Afghanistan, Naseer drew me aside. "A promise?" he
said.</LD>
<LD>   We looked at each other in the grimy light of a winter noon. We'd
spent every day together for nearly a month. It was only then that it
occurred to me-and the thought felt funny, somehow-that he was the best
friend I had in this battered place.</LD>
<LD>   Naseer Ahmed is a 28-year-old translator, a dark, soft-bellied man
with fingers like sausages and a quick laugh. He is an engineer who has
been unemployed for months. "No problem," he says. He applies this maxim
to everything-that, along with "this belong to you," which is a nice way
of saying, "Don't ask me; you're the reporter. That's your problem." He
eats too much, argues a lot and grumbles bitterly over the social and
gastronomical constraints of the holy month of Ramadan. He is a guide of
saintly patience but spotty lucidity. Some days he launches on eloquent
philosophical treatises; other times his face goes blank when I ask him
where I can buy a pen.</LD>
<TE>   That Sunday a rented sedan waited to take me from Jalalabad back to
Pakistan. That Sunday there was no gunfire, no mob, no shouting. That
Sunday there was no story, just goodbye. The calm felt unfamiliar, and I
was pretty sure I'd never see him again.</TE>
<TE>   "Promise what?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "You have photographs of the women in my family. Promise they will
never be printed in my country."</TE>
<TE>   "I'll try," I said. "But they already appeared in the newspaper in Los
Angeles."  "That is no problem," he said. "But I told you here it is
shameful for a woman. It is my family's name. Please understand."</TE>
<TE>   He pressed a grubby scrap of paper into my hand. He'd printed his
address in block letters. "You are my sister," he said. "You are always
my sister."</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you, Naseer." I groped for a farewell that fit into the simple
language we traded-but the words weren't there. So I stuck his address
into the pocket of my pants and swung the backpack over my shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "Goodbye, Naseer."</TE>
<TE>   "Will you forget me?" he asked. His face bore honest curiosity. I was
strange to him, and he studied me, even then, in the last seconds of our
acquaintance.</TE>
<TE>   "No."</TE>
<TE>   He grinned and turned away. He had a new client to tend: Another
reporter had come to take my place amid the mountains and mullahs and
moujahedeen of eastern Afghanistan. I'd bequeathed my replacement a
filthy hotel room, one tiny packet of shampoo, a ratty Pakistani sleeping
bag-and Naseer.</TE>
<TE>   Which is to say, I left him a lot.</TE>
<TE>   If I came to know Afghanistan at all, it was because Naseer followed
me around for weeks and explained it. He was my ears, my tongue and my
window, a sort of bumbling Virgil in the vibrant warscape of his country.
He spoke of the regimes that had come before and those that might come
again; told who was lying and who was powerful. He steered me high into
the snowy mountains when the shooting began in Tora Bora, and he led
hikes through the bombed ruins of abandoned Al Qaeda training grounds. He
crouched at the bedsides of children whose arms or eyes or legs were
blasted off when midnight brought bombs from the sky. Those hospital
rooms stank of rotting wool, vomit and sweat, and the wounded Afghans
twisted in bloody sheets and rolled their eyes at the stained ceiling. At
times like those, I think Naseer hated his job.</TE>
<TE>   When I wanted to write about Afghan women, Naseer took me home to his
sisters, mother and wife. When I asked him to show me his favorite place,
we visited his brothers in the slanting light of the old grain market,
where wheat pours like honey into rusting scales and old men tick off the
seasons on prayer beads. I ate lamb and rice on the dirt floor of
Naseer's house the night his baby daughter was born. It was a night of
feast and possibility, rich with buttery light and spice. The aunts and
cousins swept me into a candle-lit bedroom to dance, draped a scarf over
my head and giggled. They named the girl Kathleen, after my mother.</TE>
<TE>   This is how I found Naseer: I was with a photographer named Brian in
Jalalabad, at the family home of a warlord named Haji Zaman. It was a
great stone house that rose from a sea of gated orange groves and grape
arbors and herb gardens, and every time Zaman walked the rows of
vegetables, he'd tell us the same thing: "I can grow a salad here." He'd
been to America. "I know you people like to eat salads."</TE>
<TE>   Kabul had fallen, the Taliban were disappearing from villages all over
the country, and Brian and I were sent to cover the changing times. When
I asked Zaman to help us hire a driver, car and translator, he was
nonchalant. "Yah, there is no problem," he said. The next morning, we
passed the clusters of aimless armed boys who spent their days lolling in
the grasses at the edge of the compound. At the gate, as promised, we
found a blue sedan, complete with driver, guard and translator. But Zaman
was wrong-there was a problem: The translator didn't speak but a few
words of English.</TE>
<TE>   We piled into the back of the car, and I turned to him. "What's your
name?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   He gave a faint smile. He said nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "Um-what is your name?" I tried again.</TE>
<TE>   "Name-?" he repeated.</TE>
<TE>   Brian leaned forward to regard him from beneath a bundle of camera
equipment. "Name," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The translator squirmed a bit. "I no understand."</TE>
<TE>   "When did you learn English?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   Silence.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you understand?"</TE>
<TE>   A leaden quiet filled the car. The guard turned with a smirk and said
something to the translator, who grunted and stared stolidly out the
window. Brian and I blinked at one another.</TE>
<TE>   "Brian-"</TE>
<TE>   "I know," he muttered.</TE>
<TE>   Too late: The car veered to the gates of the governor's palace, and we
clambered down into the throngs of reporters, tribal elders and Pakistani
expatriates. Those were carnival times in Jalalabad-a restless
uncertainty pulsed in the streets. The men were meeting at midnight in
the governor's palace, elders from the ancient hills were making
pilgrimages to the palm groves of wizened statesmen, young boys were
thirsty for gore and begging to fight in exchange for a Kalashnikov and
daily bread. Alliances were being forged and discarded in the shadows of
lush gardens. The story was all around us, but we couldn't touch it,
because we could not speak. Amid the clamor, our would-be translator
touched my shoulder, held up a finger and disappeared into the crowd.
Half an hour later he panted back to us, a second young man in tow. I
looked at the newcomer: He was about my age, I guessed, with a scraggly
goatee, a face of feline corners and a decrepit sweater buttoned over a
paunchy stomach. It was Naseer.</TE>
<TE>   "My friend doesn't speak English," he explained, unnecessarily. "If
you want, I will work for you."</TE>
<TE>   "Fine," I said. The morning was sliding past, and there was no time to
be picky. "If he doesn't work out, we'll think of something tomorrow," I
murmured to Brian.</TE>
<TE>   We approached a tribal elder perched on a dried fountain bed. "Ask him
whether he feels safe under this new government," I suggested. Naseer
consulted with the mullah, who flicked distrustful glances from eyes
ringed with black paint.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Naseer said at last, a ring of triumph in his voice.</TE>
<TE>   "No, what? What did he say?"</TE>
<TE>   Naseer nodded very quickly, as if all had become clear, and held
another short dialogue. "He say he-" he began, straightening.</TE>
<TE>   "No," I interrupted. "When he gives his answer, I want you to repeat
exactly what he says. So you say to me, "I," just as if you were him.
Don't paraphrase. Do you understand?"</TE>
<TE>   "I do not know 'paraphrase,' " Naseer said, haughtily.</TE>
<TE>   "Never mind 'paraphrase.' Forget it." Our novelty was wearing out-the
elder leaned sideways to peer around us into the crowd. "Just repeat
exactly what he says. In his very words. Pretend you are him talking to
me. Now: Does he feel safe with the Taliban gone?"</TE>
<TE>   "He-"</TE>
<TE>   "I." My patience was wilting.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh. Yes. Sorry." Naseer gathered his thoughts. "I do not feel safe.
These moujahedeen are not good people. We are concerned because we have
not had a good government in 25 years."</TE>
<TE>   "Very good," I said and wondered if my enthusiasm sounded contrived to
both of us, or just to me. "You see?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes." It was a tone of precious little conviction. "I do not know
journalism." He pronounced it "generalism."</TE>
<TE>   "I know," I said. "You'll learn. It's not so hard, just strange."</TE>
<TE>   Those early days drained us-lamps in Zaman's house blazed until
morning prayers echoed in the orchards. Strange men stepped over me while
I slept. There was gunfire at night and the rumble of bombs. After a few
nights, I moved out and took up residence in the Spin Ghar hotel, a stone
skeleton of gaping corridors and frigid drafts that was falling slowly
apart amid tangles of overgrown gardens. Equipped with a filthy mattress,
a temperamental shower spigot and a window ledge for my satellite dish, I
settled into a routine. Naseer crossed town in the morning and haunted
the lobby until Brian and I appeared. When dusk settled over the
mountains, his tap-tap-tap sounded at the door of my room. "Anything
more?" he asked. "No." And he drifted off, down the hall and homeward
through the blue exhaust and clattering bicycles of the gloaming hour.</TE>
<TE>   One night, I didn't answer the door. I'm not sure why. That morning
we'd stood over the skinny bodies of dead soldiers. That day we'd
talked-again-to people who'd lost homes and children and limbs in the
bombing. And that night I sat at the window, barely breathing, thinking
in pictures instead of words. Torn pants, brains spilling onto canvas
stretchers, holes blasted pointlessly into dried fields. I watched the
sun set behind a ridge of pines, saw the light melt from groves of thorn
trees and felt weightless, almost bleached out of the world. But Naseer
tapped and tapped, and then he called my name and rapped some more. By
the time I opened the door it was too dark to see his face. "Why you
don't answer?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you are sad," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "A little."</TE>
<TE>   "I too am sad," he said. "These are my people. This is my country."</TE>
<TE>   In all the long days and dreary visions, that was the only time Naseer
spoke to me of his own suffering. He cleared his throat. "I can go?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes."</TE>
<TE>   "Do you want to come eat? One hour. You have time. The girls like to
see you."</TE>
<TE>   "No, I have to write."</TE>
<TE>   He wandered off, home to dinner and bed. The night would pass,
adolescent guards muttering over their hash joints until slumber found
them curled up on the hotel steps.</TE>
<TE>   Morning would bring Naseer as sure as daylight, and we'd start over
again.</TE>
<TE>   IN EVERY TRANSLATION, YOU CAN BE CERTAIN THAT THINGS GET LOST: WORD,
nuance, metaphor. And more: corners of memories, vividness of vision,
scraps of life. With every layer of translation, the truth becomes
cloudier. The story's the thing, and if we are lucky it comes through
intact, just a little smeared. Sometimes we grope at the edges of
stories, unable to fathom their dimensions. Other times, surely, and this
is the worst thought of all, we never realize the story is there to be
told.</TE>
<TE>   But we translate all the time. We cram moments and emotions into
sentences, even as the words overflow and snap and collapse. The language
of language is nothing next to the language of the world, where trees
interrupt the landscape instead of commas and walls stand in for periods;
where silence is a space and a face is an adjective and a touch of the
hand is a lyric "I."</TE>
<TE>   Some translators spoke decent English, some garbled and groped-and a
hapless few couldn't even discuss the weather. There were translators who
knew shortcuts, secrets and passwords. There were translators who smoked
too much hash, and one who tried to convert his television crew to Islam.
Some didn't understand a thing about warfare, but they knew which urchin
in the bazaar could drum up a flask of black market Indian whiskey.</TE>
<TE>   We learned our translator's linguistic idiosyncrasies. Instead of
saying, "He is laughing," or "they are fighting," or "she is fasting,"
Naseer said, "he is in laughing position," "they are in fighting
position" and "she is in fasting position." I assumed that, at some point
in his checkered academic past, somebody explained the phrase "sitting
position," and Naseer applied it to everything. I never corrected him.
Somehow, it never seemed the right time.</TE>
<TE>   A good translator knows who's telling the truth, why a topic is
culturally offensive and who might pull a gun on us for broaching the
subject. The translator is like a doctor who inspects our flesh, an
accountant who opens up our books- he studies our weak spots and has the
grace to step lightly around them. Likewise, his flaws and talents become
indivisibly our own: What Naseer didn't understand, I didn't understand.
If Naseer blundered, I blundered. If Naseer was eloquent, my prose was
graceful. If Naseer hadn't slept well, 1 million readers unwittingly paid
a small price.</TE>
<TE>   But here is the real trick, the final transformation: When the story
appears in ink, the translator is nowhere to be found. He wields his
power-and then he is gone.</TE>
<TE>   NASEER IS POOR, BUT HE'S NOT HUNGRY.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, his brothers, their wives and babies-everybody sleeps in a
cramped string of mud rooms hidden from a shaded Jalalabad street by a
tall wall. Carpets stifle the chill from the dirt floors. Water comes
from a well, milk from a tired old cow and eggs from a handful of
chickens. Radios prattle on, spilling the BBC news into dim rooms. There
is electric light when the government du jour keeps the municipal plant
running. The family counts on a minimal amount of political security
because they are related-albeit distantly-to Jalalabad commander Hazrat
Ali. By local standards, it is an upper-middle-class existence.</TE>
<TE>   Naseer's mother's cheeks are crumpled and as dark as chocolate. She is
a village woman, Naseer says. She knows the mountain, and the river, and
the field. She is perplexed by the city. She doesn't go to the bazaar.
Naseer's father left her long ago for a younger, prettier woman. Naseer
hasn't seen his father in a long time.</TE>
<TE>   When the other women winced and bobbed their heads and cooed-gestures
they employed because we could not speak-she looked at me with the
impassive eyes of an interested child. I never heard her talk, not even
to her sons. It was Ramadan, and none of the adults ate or drank during
daylight hours-but the old woman took lunch with the babies, crouched in
the dust, and broke her bread with spindly fingers. When the sun stood
high overhead, and the women split logs and chased the hens, she muttered
to herself in the shade of an ash tree.</TE>
<TE>   "How old is she?" I asked Naseer.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   "Ask her."</TE>
<TE>   He said something, but she did not blink.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know," Naseer said.</TE>
<TE>   I should not be surprised: Age is liquid here. Most people can only
guess how old they are, and Naseer thought I belabored the questions of
how old, how long, how many. I suspect he sometimes invented ages to
pacify me. I noticed an overwhelming majority of our subjects happened to
be 28 or 34.</TE>
<TE>   "Ask her what time she remembers as the most peaceful time, as the
best years," I told Naseer. "Under which government was she happiest?"</TE>
<TE>   He paused, then spoke dutifully. The younger women tittered. The old
woman stretched her lips over her gums and stared at Naseer.</TE>
<TE>   "She is simple," he told me. "She does not know. She is not educated."</TE>
<TE>   Naseer talked a lot about who was and who was not educated. It is one
of his favorite phrases-"They are not educated people." He used it to
condemn the moujahedeen who ran wild in the streets, smacking the
villagers with bamboo canes. He used it to excuse the roundabout replies
of the Afghans we interviewed. When he spoke of the injustice of the
Taliban regime, he said, "It was not important. They were not educated
people." He trotted out this platitude the day I set off a minor riot in
the bazaar by trying on a burqa. He said it when a little boy grabbed my
breast in the mountains. He said it when I stared at the hungry old men
crouched in the doorways of dirt huts. "Forgive them, they know not what
they do. Better yet, forget them, for what they do is of little
consequence."</TE>
<TE>   Drought and war have turned his country into a dusty madhouse of
malnutrition and land mines; of crutches and graveyards and absent men.
But in Naseer's eyes, nothing is so bitter as the death of education. He
carries this grudge against his government. Because he is an engineer, he
measures peace in bridges, cement and tracts of farmland. The
nongovernmental organization where he once worked fled Afghanistan months
ago. Naseer is certain his colleagues will be back; he carries his
expired identification badge everywhere he goes. He fingered the worn
plastic like a talisman when he wanted to remind us that he wasn't always
unemployed. Sometimes, on long drives, he held the old badge and stared
out the window, droning on about the durability of concrete. "I am not
interested in politics," he said the day we met. "I am interested in
pavement." I HAD NEVER SEEN THESE MEN. THEY DIDN'T LOOK LIKE FARMERS OR
TRANSlators or soldiers. I thought they had the wrong door when they came
to my room at the Jalalabad hotel. They glanced over their shoulders and
crowded into my face, voices soft and urgent.</TE>
<TE>   "Let us come in," the short one said.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you want?"</TE>
<TE>   "Just let us in to talk."</TE>
<TE>   "No," I said. "We can talk in the hall."</TE>
<TE>   Their eyes flashed quick, silent thoughts between them.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm busy," I snapped. "What do you want?"</TE>
<TE>   "How do we know you work for the Los Angeles Times?"</TE>
<TE>   "I suppose you don't. So what?"</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have a card?"</TE>
<TE>   "Who are you?"</TE>
<TE>   "What was your interest in the Al Qaeda houses?"</TE>
<TE>   "Forget it. I will not answer unless you explain who you are."</TE>
<TE>   "Please."</TE>
<TE>   "No!" My voice was rising. "Who the hell do you think-"</TE>
<TE>   Naseer heard me from the terrace and ran down the dim corridor, hammy
hands flopping in panic. The strangers turned to watch him. I leaned
against the door jam, crossed my arms and waited: The three men rattled
in Pashto. It was fast. Arms waved, Naseer made sweeping motions with his
flat hand as if to say, "Absolutely not." Finally the two men slumped off
down the hall, and Naseer turned to me. Pools of worry stood in his eyes.
He swallowed.</TE>
<TE>   "This very bad," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Who are they?"</TE>
<TE>   "Pshht-I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   I found out later. The men worked for a primitive secret service
cobbled together by the new government. They had been asking the
translators about me. Maybe they thought I was a spy. Maybe they thought
I was sympathetic to Al Qaeda. Maybe they thought there was some money to
be made in harassing me. Who knows? Whatever they thought, they made
Naseer awfully nervous about being associated with me. We drifted down
the cold stone stairwell, out the door and into the decrepit gardens.
December was coming.</TE>
<TE>   "What did they say to you?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't answer.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's sit here," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to sit?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes."</TE>
<TE>   He laughed, then shrugged and said, "OK."</TE>
<TE>   "Why? Is that bad?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, not bad." He glanced toward the lawn, though, to see who was
watching.</TE>
<TE>   Scabby grass, cold dirt. The tangles of tattered roses were taller
than our heads. Nobody weeded the flowers anymore. From behind screens of
thorny branches, beggar children fixed us with coffee gazes. Naseer
folded his hands over his gut, mouth pursed.</TE>
<TE>   "What was that, Naseer?"</TE>
<TE>   "You don't know my Afghanistan," he said. "This not America. Here you
go to jail, and nobody comes. This is not a country of courts. This is a
country of beatings." He should know. Naseer once had a job installing
water pumps, bridging rivers and fixing roads in remote villages. He
loved the work, but it came with a quotient of violence. There were
beatings from the Taliban and from roadside thugs. Beatings for refusing
to give the pumps to crooks, beatings for refusing to pay bribes,
beatings for refusing to apologize. He didn't mind so much-those years
were thick with bruises anyway, no matter what. Beatings for women, and
beatings for men. Late on Naseer's wedding night, he slipped a forbidden
cassette into his car stereo. He hummed along, and music spilled into the
inky night. He was happy. He was too loud. The vice and virtue officers
chased him down. Naseer went to his wedding bed bloody, and his wife
bandaged his wounds.</TE>
<TE>   "What will my family do if these men come to my house after you
leave?" he asked. "You'll be in America. What can you do then?"</TE>
<TE>   I looked at Naseer and said nothing, because I had no answer.
Afternoon was giving way to night; warplanes lumbered overhead.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a poor man, and I need work," Naseer said, twisting a strand of
grass. "But not if my family is hurt. Nothing is enough for that."</TE>
<TE>   He stopped and made a hard "Shah!" at the knot of beggar children. The
reeds snapped, and they were gone.</TE>
<TE>   "If I die," he continued, "that belong to Allah. But I think I should
not work for you more."</TE>
<TE>   "Naseer-"</TE>
<TE>   "I have family."</TE>
<TE>   "Naseer-" He's right; what do I know? "You have to decide."</TE>
<TE>   "I will talk to my brothers tonight," he said. "Tomorrow I will tell
you."</TE>
<TE>   "All right."</TE>
<TE>   "Now," he said, "we should go."</TE>
<TE>   "From the garden?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, of course. This not America," he scolded. "This is not a country
for sitting and discussing."</TE>
<TE>   The day was old. Sunset bled in the sky. My room was as cold and dirty
as the day before. I lay on my bed, listened to the dull mutter of voice
and foot, watched a thin gray dusk wash the ceiling. I fell asleep
thinking about Naseer's family. When I awoke it was a few hours to dawn
and black everywhere. I wrapped myself in a sleeping bag and pecked out a
story for the day's paper. Winter crept in the windows and numbed my
fingers. I felt Naseer was gone; I knew in my sleep I had said goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   But when morning broke he was back, scrambling up the steps, his new
shoes a-clatter on the tiles. He was there when I came from morning tea.
I looked at his face and knew. "So?" "My brothers said, 'What are you
afraid of?' " Naseer said. "They said, 'Megan is a woman. If she isn't
afraid, why should you be?' " Then he shrugged and laughed a quavery
laugh. But he didn't look at me. It was the only time he smiled all day.</TE>
<TE>   It was the last I heard from the strangers. I saw them around
sometimes and made a point of meeting their eyes, but they never
approached me again. A few days before I left Afghanistan, I caught sight
of them for the last time. They were hiking up a rocky slope alongside a
television crew. Naseer saw them and nudged me. "Look," he murmured.
"They too are now translators." "Really?"</TE>
<TE>   Naseer spread his hands and grinned. "That is the way," he said.
"Everybody is having to eat."</TE>
<TE>   BECAUSE WE TALKED ENGLISH, WE WERE TRAFFICKING IN WHAT HAD LONG been a
taboo tongue. To speak English was illegal under the Taliban. But as the
regime weakened, scattered and fled, tentatively the ban evaporated.
English survived the years in the shadows, just as women still knew how
to dance and little boys whistled the tunes they'd learned from forbidden
Pakistani cassette tapes. We found a crude English, faltering and spotted
with remnants of British imperialism (an Afghan commander of scant
vocabulary told me his men would get Al Qaeda "by hook or by crook")-but
it was there.</TE>
<TE>   And in those times, it was precious. What had been a whispered tongue
became a rich commodity as journalists swarmed eastern Afghanistan,
hungry for stories and lost in a wilderness of Pashto, Urdu and Dari. Men
who spoke English could feed their families for months. Prospective
translators swarmed the lawn in front of the hotel-little boys with
scrawny necks who'd pored over banned texts; old men who remembered
faulty English from their days in the old schools; former university
students who'd quietly polished their grammar with the help of foreign
aid workers. In an economy that had lurched to a dead stop, English meant
a chance to pocket between $35 and $75 a day. It was the best gig in
town-in fact, one of the only gigs in town. The translators were
unemployed doctors, students and merchants.</TE>
<TE>   I was peering over a ridge in Tora Bora when Brian tapped me on the
shoulder. "Look who I found," he said. At his side stood a moujahedeen
we'd interviewed weeks earlier, an idealistic literature student from
Kabul who'd ventured east to do battle against the Taliban. But as the
war moved into the snowy mountains-and turned from patriotic theory to a
reality of whistling mortars and empty stomachs-he'd abandoned the
guerrilla troops. Why? He spoke decent English.</TE>
<TE>   "I am translator now," he told me and shrugged a little sheepishly.
He'd pulled a polyester tuxedo coat over his robes. "I work with the
Spanish television."</TE>
<TE>   One day Naseer was unusually morose. "What's the matter?" I asked. He
rattled out a deep sigh. "You know your first translator?" I didn't know
who he meant. "Yes. My friend. He did not speak English." Oh, yes. Of
course.</TE>
<TE>   This is what Naseer said: Because he had linked Naseer with steady
clients, our sullen, long-forgotten translator was collecting a daily
finder's fee. He waited after sundown in the gate of Naseer's house,
haunted the hospital entrance when Naseer's wife was in labor, pestered
his brothers at the bazaar. When he found Naseer, he shook him down for a
cut of his salary.</TE>
<TE>   "That's absurd," I told Naseer. "We haven't seen him in weeks. Why
should he get paid?" "I don't know," Naseer said.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell him you won't pay him. Tell him it's extortion."</TE>
<TE>   "I can't. He is my friend. It is bad for my family name."</TE>
<TE>   "Why?"</TE>
<TE>   "That's just-" His voice trailed off, and he shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just the way it is?" suggested Brian.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just the way it is," Naseer agreed.</TE>
<TE>   KNOWING NASEER IS LIKE ENTERING AN AFGHAN HOME-IT IS A SLOW, ELABorate
pass from the public facade through gates and walls and layers of
constructed personality. He opens one door at a time, and only when he is
ready.</TE>
<TE>   One day I learned something about Naseer: He is in love with a woman
who is not his wife. He speaks of his lover over green tea one afternoon,
cross-legged on the floor of his house. His wife's belly is swollen,
their baby is due any day. But Naseer talks in a big voice, as if daring
his family to protest.</TE>
<TE>   His wife is named Sediqa. She is 22, a slight woman with creamy skin,
coarse hair and a thin voice squeezed from the top of her head. Her
family was poor, and she had no schooling. With me she is shy, drops her
eyes and guards her responses. Marriage to Naseer was a coup for the
farmer's daughter. "I love my wife," Naseer sighs. "But I don't like her
family. They are not educated people."</TE>
<TE>   He was studying at the university in Kabul when he fell in love with a
medical student. She was sharp, saucy-she debated religion and philosophy
and, like Naseer, wanted to mend her broken country. They walked on the
river banks, held hands and promised to wed. Then Naseer came home to
Jalalabad and found that his family had brokered a marriage to Sediqa. So
he drove back to Kabul and gave the news to the doctor. To hear Naseer
tell it, his lover was sorry, but everybody knew there was no choice. To
back out of an arranged marriage would bring shame on his family. "If I
can lift off my poverty, I will marry Doctor and have two wives," he
said. "Doctor is waiting."</TE>
<TE>   "Doesn't Sediqa mind?" I asked, wondering at the same time how long
Doctor will wait. "What she can do? If she does not like, she can go back
to her people. I already told her I do not care if we get divorce. She
said, 'No, that is shame for me.' "</TE>
<TE>   I don't say anything. Naseer says: "How is it in your country? Do the
girls and boys choose?" "Most of the time. Most of the people pick their
own partners. I guess it's still complicated. People marry for all sorts
of reasons, not always for love."</TE>
<TE>   "I think marriage is for love," he said. "Will you choose for
yourself?"</TE>
<TE>   "Oh," I said. "Yes. Definitely."</TE>
<TE>   "That is good, that is the way it should be," he nodded. "I am a
democrat. I think everybody should decide for themselves. Boys, girls, it
does not matter. But-" He looks at me. "What about loving?"</TE>
<TE>   "What do you mean?"</TE>
<TE>   Blood seeped into his cheeks, but he pressed on. "You know. Loving.
Touching. I am having a baby now . . . you see . . . "</TE>
<TE>   "Oh. Uh-huh. What about it?"</TE>
<TE>   "Are the boys and girls free there? Can they love before they are
married?"</TE>
<TE>   "Well, yes. I mean, they're free. There's no law if they're 16."</TE>
<TE>   "That is good."</TE>
<TE>   "What about here?" I asked him.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually there is nothing before marriage. But sometimes you can
negotiate."</TE>
<TE>   "With whom?"</TE>
<TE>   "Ah-with the fathers." Naseer wagged a finger. "Father of Sediqa is
very poor. He wants the marriage very much. I talk to him, and we agree
that we can touch before wedding. Not everything. Almost everything. As
long as there can be no baby."</TE>
<TE>   "Really? Is that common?"</TE>
<TE>   "Not so common," Naseer said. "That was special."</TE>
<TE>   "And did you follow his wishes?"</TE>
<TE>   "Of course," Naseer said. "We were in agreement."</TE>
<TE>   IT IS A COOL AFTERNOON, AND I have come to sit with the women of
Naseer's family. Khaista serves us. The first wife of Naseer's brother,
Khaista is sterile. Her husband took a second wife to bear his babies,
but he tells the family he loves Khaista best. A chilly air hangs between
the two women. Now Khaista sets a pot of tea before me, scoops sugar. She
has speckled eyes and a toothy smile.</TE>
<TE>   "Tash-a-cour," I say.</TE>
<TE>   A giggle ripples through the room.</TE>
<TE>   "They say they wish you could speak Pashto," Naseer says.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell them I wish I could, too," I say.</TE>
<TE>   He repeats it, and "ahhh . . . " they beam and nod. Naseer crosses his
arms on his chest and stretches his legs before him.</TE>
<TE>   "OK," he says, "I will not translate. You learn."</TE>
<TE>   "No, Naseer. Come on."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes. It is best way."</TE>
<TE>   His sisters groan and chatter, but Naseer shakes his head. And just
like that, the strings of conversation have snapped. We try to get along:
draw our thoughts with our hands, squabble and pose and flounce, laugh
and yell and pound the dirt floors. Their eyes are big and warm and they
touch my hair and cheeks, but I don't know what they're saying. I am
alone in a riot of sound. From this noisy island, I glance at Naseer. He
smirks as if to say, "See what happens? You do need me," and I incline my
head to tell him I never doubted it. But what I say with my lips is this:
"You think you're so smart."</TE>
<TE>   He laughs, because he gets it.</TE>
<TE>   ONE WINTRY DAY IN TORA BORA, THE winds stung with the breath of snow,
and even the trees trembled. Al Qaeda fighters were brokering a
cease-fire with Afghan commanders on the peak of a mountain, and we drove
and hiked as close as we could. But then the soldiers came stomping down
the dirt trail, pushing the journalists before them. Bloated with
indignation, Naseer turned, put his hands on his hips and yelled at the
soldiers. The men sneered, and before he could duck, the barrel of a gun
came cracking down onto his shoulder. Naseer winced and touched his arm
as if to make sure it was still there. "There is no problem," he said,
and we trudged down the mountain. "What did you say?" I asked him.</TE>
<TE>   "I say, 'These are journalist people. They have right to see. They
must tell the world what happens here. This is their job, and this is
their right.' "</TE>
<TE>   "You did? Naseer, when did you get so passionate about press freedom?"</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," he said, and we walked on. I still don't know whether
he didn't have an answer, or didn't understand my question.</TE>
<TE>   Later that day, he turned to me. "Do you think I could be journalist?"</TE>
<TE>   "Do you want to be?"</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, he said. And then he changed the subject.</TE>
<TE>   I HAVE SAID GOODBYE, AND I AM leaving Afghanistan-the light that falls
like powder on the poppy fields, the mortars stacked like firewood in the
broken-down sheds at the abandoned terror compounds, the throaty green of
the mineral rivers.</TE>
<TE>   It is a few days before Christmas. In the back of the car, I am tired,
staring into a scrubbed sky, dreaming of red wine and a deep bath as the
empty plains slip past. It is Eid al-Fitr; Ramadan is over, and a hungry
land has sat down to eat. Along the road women split pomegranates, and
the red juice stains their fingers. Men roast lamb shanks over open
fires, and children turn from the blaze to watch us pass with eyes like
globes. This old road is cloaked in the amnesia of holidays. We are
drawing close to the Khyber Pass. The mountain route will drop us down
into Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Then everything slips: A tire snags on a roadside rock, and the car
spins out. We are swinging across the pavement in sickening loops. I see
the grill of a cargo truck rear up before us, and I am certain I am about
to die, so I close my eyes. What a pity to perish like this, on the
margins of a war. I remember that drunks survive accidents because they
don't stiffen up, and I tell myself to go limp. The car, this seat, is a
fixed point in a mad, slipping-away landscape. I am the axis now; the
country, the mountains, the war and the wide yards of dirt stretching
back to Jalalabad revolve around me.</TE>
<TE>   That's illusion, of course. I'm the one careening. I'm the one who's
out of control. These old hills, what do they care? This smuggler's path,
the road to Pakistan and India and China-these things stand where they've
always been. I remember what Naseer said. "I am not afraid of killing.
This is a country of killing. Only I am afraid for my family." There was
knowledge in his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is a great, grating crash and everything, everybody slams.
The car stops, shuddering and smoking, wrinkled as a steel leaf. I sit
and breathe. Alive should be impossible. We scramble from the car and
take the air, cold and sweet with gasoline. I am running, pounding over
the empty land. The adolescent guard hired to protect the car is laughing
and laughing. His Kalashnikov clatters on the rocks. I stop. I am
shaking. The men look politely away. It is dark by the time we reach
Islamabad, and the night is gaudy with strings of light. At the
Marriott-impossibly bright, lush, rich-I marvel at whispers of perfume in
a twinkling lobby, a basket of fruit on my bedside table, sweet soaps in
the bathroom. My eyes are numb, as if they haven't seen colors in years.
I let the water pound in the tub, wrap a hotel robe around my dusty body
and stare into the mirror.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know why I am looking for Naseer's address. Maybe I
half-remembered it wasn't there when I dug out some rupees for the truck
driver who had let us hitch a ride to the border. Or maybe I know,
somewhere in the underground of my thoughts, that it's gone. I snatch up
my jeans-and the back pockets are empty. I rifle through worn notebooks,
but it's not there, either. Not folded with the veils. Not tucked into my
journal. My fingers scramble through vacant pockets. Soon there is no
place left to look, and I know I've lost it. I turn my eyes to the
darkened hills outside, and think how easy-and impossible-it is to leave
people behind.</TE>
<TE>   I am home now, in the States. And I think and think but can't recall
whether I gave Naseer my address. It seems as if I should have, but I
can't find a memory of doing so. Still, I open the mailbox thinking that
maybe-maybe-there will be an envelope addressed in his shaky hand. Maybe
Afghanistan will establish a postal system, or a neighbor will make a
trip to Pakistan and mail a letter for him. Maybe he will tell me he's an
engineer again, and his daughter is walking, and his sisters are learning
English in school. Maybe he'll say he has relinquished hope of marrying
the Doctor, and turned his attention to his wife. Maybe he will say his
brother's medical school has opened back up, or that his mother has died
peacefully in her sleep. I haven't heard a word.</TE>

<HD>Bringing Work Home</HD>
<DH>LANDSCAPE DESIGNER MYVA NEWMAN USES THE TOOLS OF THE TRADE IN HER
RANCHO PARK GARDEN</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN HEEGER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AFTER 10 YEARS IN AN APARTMENT, MYVA NEWMAN CONSIDERS A backyard
bath near a lemon tree one of the perks of home ownership. Another is
claiming space for her chair and plant collections. "A garden makes your
house bigger," Newman says. "It gives you privacy outside, places to
bring your friends and more room for all the plants you crave. Gradually
I'm erasing the line between indoors and out."</LD>
<LD>   A planting designer for Tichenor &amp; Thorp Architects, Newman found her
Rancho Park house in 1999 and immediately set to stripping it. Out went
heavy awnings, plantation shutters and even windows, which she replaced
with French doors. She painted walls green to connect the inside rooms
with garden spaces, though the garden still needed work. Behind her
Spanish-style bungalow, a dying ash tree slumped on patchy grass, and the
focal point was a concrete pad for trash containers. Phone lines and
neighbors' roofs pressed in from both sides. The front garden was equally
disappointing, with one skinny birch. Newman found herself being stared
at by passersby.</LD>
<TE>   "This lot is typical," she says. "About 50 by 100 feet is the size
many people deal with, and it's full of all the same problems." To solve
hers, Newman, who works on larger properties as a professional, applied
the same tools (hedges, trees, perennials and stone) and the same rules
she uses daily. "No matter how small or large your lot, your eye should
find something interesting wherever you look. Wherever you feel like
sitting, put a chair."</TE>
<TE>   Taking her own advice, she began by ripping out her front lawn,
replacing the birch with an olive tree and installing a hedge of
Pittosporum crassifolium-a rugged shrub with rounded, gray-green leaves.
Within its crisp embrace, she set a tiny square lawn as a foil for highly
textured plants such as honey bush, Jerusalem sage, lavender, rosemary,
euphorbia. She arranged these in 6-foot-deep borders that make the tight
space seem paradoxically bigger. Pots of succulents carry the plantings
up the steps to the front door and an old-fashioned porch glider nearby.
Similar pots surround the rear French doors, tying her garden rooms
together.</TE>
<TE>   Lawns are another linking tool. Newman uses just enough grass to set
off the foliage tumble at its edges. "As in the front, I began the back
with a rough sketch-a narrow grass carpet framed by broken concrete from
the trash patio I'd demolished and I planted borders on all sides," she
says. "I started arranging plants I liked-more euphorbias, lavender,
sisyrinchium, loquat, bronze flax-but then I'd see something at a nursery
or in a friend's garden, and I'd have to somehow make room for it."</TE>
<TE>   Roses are another garden motif, and her rose list reads like a Who's
Who of noble French and English life: 'Lady Hillingdon,' 'Norwich
Castle,' 'Abbaye de Cluny.' Most bloom in her favorite shades of peach
and apricot, a showy complement to the bronze and purple leaves she
likes, and all are sweetly scented, another must among her plant picks.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these, such as peppermint geranium and culinary sage, hold
their fragrance in their leaves. Others, such as the angels' trumpet near
the tub, emit their perfumes at night, when Newman is home to enjoy them.
"Certain landscape needs you understand right away," she says, "some only
after you live in a place."</TE>
<TE>   The outdoor tub was an early choice, arising from her love of baths
and water and the fact that a contractor friend had two vintage tubs to
spare. (The second now holds Newman's aquatic plants.) As to outdoor
furnishings, she says, "Drag home anything you can carry from a flea
market and then have good cushions made." Comfort and convenience are
key, as is the invitation to linger. "I've bought so many chairs," she
says. "I've had to give some away." The designer continues to remake the
space and has plans to break up the driveway to allow for more planting
space. In the meantime, she says, her future plans are "to keep
collecting plants and eventually move to a bigger place!"</TE>

<HD>An Old Flame</HD>
<DH>Broiled or Torched, Creme Brulee Remains a Classic</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL BARBER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It seemed like a fair trade.</LD>
<LD>   We were visiting my English relatives, and they offered us free run of
their spacious London home as well as occupancy of their 400-year-old
weekend house in a Welsh village, subway maps, expensive cheese and the
entertainment value of a quarrelsome and idiosyncratic family. In return
I offered the services of my wife, who was then indentured to a popular
Napa Valley restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   "She's a pastry chef," I said.</LD>
<TE>   The reply was a rousing plea for creme brulee.</TE>
<TE>   The primary advocate was my cousin George, then 17. As one of the
world's foremost admirers of creme brulee, George could not bear to wait
for his sugar-capped custard to cool. So he kenneled the family
dogs-Barnsbury and Finsbury, with their floppy ears and Vienna
sausage-like legs-and set his ramekin in the cold, damp air of the patio.
Off to receive his obligatory 8 p.m. teenage phone call, George's
instructions were specific: Do not, under any circumstances, let the dogs
out.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, the British can be so gullible. (Remember the Spice Girls?) We
spread a little leftover custard in a ramekin, swapped it for my cousin's
and released the hounds before he returned to the kitchen. His upper lip
losing its stiffness at the sight of the lapping Barney and Finney,
George raged at us all until we burst out laughing.</TE>
<TE>   His obsession with creme brulee might be bred, for the English have
enjoyed this delicacy at least since the beginning of the 18th century,
when they were calling it "burnt cream." The French term existed before
that. Francois Massialot mentioned it in his epic 'Le Cuisinier Roial et
Bourgeois' in 1691.</TE>
<TE>   True, the two nations were said to produce slightly different
versions. The French dessert called for milk, some sugar in the custard
and a paper-thin, crumbly crust. The Brits improved the recipe by using
heavy cream and opted to forgo the sugar in the mix and to bake a
thicker, more impenetrable layer of sugar.</TE>
<TE>   There are those who insist you should never pair an English custard
with a French mantle, or vice-versa. I say suit your own tastes. You can
even gild the concoction slightly with chocolate, raspberries, Grand
Marnier or coffee. Though brimming with foreign accent marks and
hoity-toity connotations, creme brulee is surprisingly easy to execute.
Just don't add the scalded cream too quickly or bake the custard too
long, or you'll cook your egg yolks. Of course, it's the brulee end-the
broiling-that makes people jittery. Professional chefs use a salamander,
which used to mean something akin to a branding iron but now refers to a
high-powered, flame-top broiling oven. A small butane torch gives the
most control. But a standard broiler works, too, if you retrieve the
goods somewhere between caramelization and incineration.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, don't be fooled by creme brulee's biggest turnoff: its
ubiquity. Yes, every restaurant offers it. But they all serve bread and
water, too. Just think of creme brulee as a staple rather than fad.</TE>
<TE>Creme Brulee</TE>
<TE>   Serves 6</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 cups heavy cream</TE>
<TE>   8 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 pinch salt</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   12 teaspoons sugar</TE>
<TE>   Bring cream to simmer on stove top. In a separate bowl, whisk egg
yolks, sugar and salt until blended. Slowly whisk in hot cream, then stir
in vanilla. Divide mixture among 6 ramekins. Place them in baking pan and
carefully pour boiling water into pan until ramekins are half-submerged.
Bake at 300 degrees for 35-40 minutes, until just set. Remove from pan,
cool at room temperature, then chill thoroughly. When ready to serve,
sprinkle 2 teaspoons sugar over each custard. Place ramekins under hot
broiler for several seconds, until sugar melts and caramelizes. Remove
immediately and serve.</TE>

<DH>A Chic Valley Restaurant Turns Up the Volume With Its Cal-Asian
Cuisine</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For a chef who really cares about cooking, a stint behind the
stoves at a trendy, white-hot restaurant may seem like a sojourn in hell.
The maitre d's at these places consistently overbook. It's catch 'em
while you can-before the trend-seekers move on. Most people are more
interested in the scene than the food anyway, and by the time they're
seated, they're too hungry to notice subtleties in the cooking.</LD>
<TE>   After a two-year sentence at just such a place-Linq in Los Angeles-and
20 years of working for others, chef Andre Guerrero is out, and he's not
going into anybody else's kitchen but his own. Guerrero has moved to the
San Fernando Valley and opened his first restaurant on his own, on
Sherman Oaks' restaurant row. Named for his son, Max is a boxy storefront
on the site of the old JoeJoe's. A smart remodel has transformed it into
a glamorous boite, with white damask walls, sleek banquettes and soft
lighting from silk-shaded lamps. An alcove to one side of the main room
is the three-table "star room." "Really? Stars?" I queried the waiter.
"You'd be surprised who comes in," he says. Somehow I believed him. With
a crowd here for the food, Guerrero is reveling in his brand of
California-Asian fusion. He is Filipino American, and has cooked French,
Italian and California cuisine. In fact, he was an early fusion artist at
Duet in Glendale, and some of his fans from that late restaurant have
sought him out here. With tables packed closely together, this
4-month-old newcomer feels like downtown New York.</TE>
<TE>   One night one of my guests, who had once lived in a Filipino
neighborhood in New York, jumped at the lumpia, the traditional shrimp
and pork spring rolls. Rolled as slender as cigars, with a mild shrimp
and pork filling, they come piping hot from the kitchen and not a bit
greasy. A refreshing Asian slaw accompanies them. For my taste, the
lumpia are a tad bland, but easily perked up with the spicy dipping
sauce. Guerrero's subtle touch comes to the fore in his Thai lemon grass
coconut soup. Fragrant with Thai basil and light as silk (read: not too
much coconut milk), it's laced with fresh corn and delicious little
dumplings plump with a pleasing chicken and mushroom stuffing.</TE>
<TE>   Crab ravioli are more Asian in inspiration than Italian: round pillows
of chewy dough filled with fresh crab meat in a lovely nuanced lobster
sauce that upstages the ravioli itself. Hamachi sashimi, drizzled with
yuzu citrus and served with a chilled soba noodle salad, would do a top
sushi restaurant proud.</TE>
<TE>   One of my favorites is his tea-smoked salmon. Curing it in soy sauce,
mirin and fresh ginger gives it an unusual lilt. The presentation is
different, too. The supple sliced salmon comes with a slab of tender
brioche that has a hole in the middle filled with an over-easy egg-sort
of a refined toad in the hole.</TE>
<TE>   Main courses are more uneven. You can't go wrong with Guerrero's
roasted half chicken, a standard dish that's upgraded with a flavorful
bird and the piquant salty-sour taste of preserved lemon and a garnish of
sweet blanched garlic. Crusty and juicy, the chicken sits on a swatch of
sauteed spinach and comes with garlic mashed potatoes, making this a fine
supper all on its own, and a real bargain.</TE>
<TE>   Applewood smoked baby back ribs are terrific one night, less
compelling another. At their best, the ribs are falling-off-the-bone
tender, permeated with a light haze of smoke. The barbecue sauce seems to
taste of tamarind, but it's actually hoisin. Since the ribs come in a
generous double rack, they're fun to share as an appetizer or even a
middle course.  Guerrero makes a mean New York pepper steak, too,
encrusted with black peppercorns. They add interest to a fine, but not
remarkable, cut of beef, and  pack a wallop of heat, so the buttery
spinach and lovely Gorgonzola-potato gratin are a welcome contrast.</TE>
<TE>   He gets a little carried away with mushroom risotto, though. The
texture is right, but loading the risotto with duck confit, arugula and
white truffle oil deflects attention from what's most important: the rice
and the mushrooms. It's also hard to understand where he's going with the
Indian coriander masala-crusted cod. The spice mix is wonderful, and the
fish nicely cooked, but the thick mat of chickpea-battered vegetable
fritter that sits on top is heavy and distracts from the fish.</TE>
<TE>   Each time I eat at Max, I wonder where Guerrero found his staff. They
know what they're doing, remaining remarkably composed in the confines of
the small room and under pressure from a demanding clientele. They also
all feel strongly enough about the food to offer their opinion of what's
best.</TE>
<TE>   Pastry chef Jan Purdy has contributed some interesting dishes to the
dessert menu. Look to Italian plum buckle with Armagnac ice cream. In
this version of the old-fashioned American dessert, you have to dig down
deep for the fruit and the warm cake-like buckle beneath the Armagnac ice
cream. Buttermilk panna cotta is lighter than traditional "cooked cream"
and blessedly not very sweet.</TE>
<TE>   I'm less fond of her date and fig tart with oat streusel, which a
couple of waiters described as close to a Fig Newton. If, by chance,
profiteroles are a special, order them. I'd almost given up on finding a
good profiterole in a restaurant. The choux pastry is fresh and, when I
tried them, filled with a smooth, gelato-like pistachio ice cream and
napped in an inky dark chocolate sauce.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant does have some problems, namely, the noise level. As I
waited outside one night, a couple staggered out, hands over their ears.
"It's like a rock concert in there," one of them said. "What?" shouted
the other in mock deafness.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, it's clear Max has been welcomed to the Valley with open
arms. There are restaurateurs who, in essence, cook down for the Valley.
It's heartening to see diners flock to one with so much integrity and
heart. Somebody soon, I know it, is going to come up with a solution for
the noise level. Because these are people who love to talk as much as
they love to eat.</TE>
