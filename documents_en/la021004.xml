<HD>The Pacific Symphony Embraces a Challenge</HD>
<DH>Opening its season with panache, the orchestra tackles a
program that includes tricky Strauss and handsome Picker songs.</DH>

<LD>Carl St.Clair brought a generous program, with two soloists, to the
opening week of his 13th season at the helm of the Pacific Symphony
Wednesday night in Segerstrom Hall at the Orange County Performing
Arts Center. The orchestra played with a virtuosic panache not always
present at the beginning of its season.</LD>
<LD>   Variety marked the agenda, which began with the premiere of the
orchestral version of a set of songs by the American opera composer
Tobias Picker, "Tres Sonetos de Amor"; offered the local debut of the
Brazilian pianist Arnaldo Cohen in Liszt's E-flat Concerto; and
concluded with the sprawling beauties in Richard Strauss' tone poem,
"A Hero's Life."</LD>
<LD>   This is a demanding program for the 24-year-old orchestra, but the
players met all its exigencies with abundant resourcefulness.
St.Clair elicited luscious lyricism and a wonderful palette of
colorful, quiet playing from the orchestra in Picker's evocative,
neo-Romantic songs. It gave Liszt's familiar concerto its contrasts
and its bravado, perfectly matching Cohen's brilliant overview of the
piece, and found the full kaleidoscope of musical egomania in
Strauss' "Ein Heldenleben."</LD>
<TE>   Strauss' tone poems tend to go on and on--in these purely
instrumental works, unlike his opera scores, the composer did not
have the restraining influence of his astute librettists. St.Clair &amp;
Co. offered this paean to the composer's narcissism all its
self-trumpeting, musical bite and indulgent detailing, and one had to
admire the brightness of the playing. But the work's length still
modified its thrills.</TE>
<TE>   Before the concert, Picker explained that he considered his work a
premiere, but only of sorts. The settings of three poems by Pablo
Neruda had been created for different forces and were re-imagined for
baritone and full orchestra. It was also revealed that Picker's
Pacific Symphony commission came at the behest of Pacific Symphony
donor Michael Kerr, as a 40th birthday surprise for his wife, Kari.</TE>
<TE>   Nathan Gunn, an American baritone of great refinement and
unlimited promise, was the right soloist in Picker's handsome
settings. They are likely to be a serious addition to the repertory:
the music effortlessly amplifies the emotional ambience of the texts,
and the three songs offer handsome contrasts.</TE>
<TE>   For an encore, Gunn sang the Serenade from Mozart's "Don
Giovanni," at a most persuasive tempo, savoring the words, and with a
honeyed tone perfectly suited to the aria.</TE>
<TE>   Here, St.Clair and the Pacific Symphony achieved an accompaniment
that was a high point in the evening.</TE>

<HD>Art Forged in Castoffs and Cold Reality</HD>
<DH>For her installation at the Hammer, Tomoko Takahashi tries
to stay true to her impulses amid practicalities like fire marshal
edicts.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It looks like the aftermath of a cyclone, the loose objects from the
streets and backyards of Los Angeles ripped up, twirled in a blender
and then plunked down into a tiered jumble of lawn furniture, car
tires, a broken swing set, a Jacuzzi tub, desiccated palm fronds,
even the fuselage of an airplane.</LD>
<LD>   We're inside the unfinished shell of the UCLA Hammer Museum's
theater--4,300 square feet of concrete and cinder block, sloping down
toward a raised stage--and every horizontal surface is strewn with
the evidence of breakdown, obsolescence and faded interest. It's a
wonder some of it fits through the doors--that fuselage, for
instance.</LD>
<LD>   Even security guards on break from elsewhere in the building have
come to gawk.</LD>
<TE>   "Look at that," they whisper to one another.</TE>
<TE>   But spend a little time amid the chaos and you realize there's
order here. Most of the objects are upright, spaced far enough apart
so you get a good look at them, and related items are grouped
together--the palm parts, for example, are near the door. The fact
is, these are installation artist Tomoko Takahashi's raw materials;
the detritus of modern life is her palette and she has laid out her
colors.</TE>
<TE>   This afternoon, Ann Philbin, the Hammer's director, and Ellen
Wirth, director of operations, have come by to check on the progress
of the installation.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't this amaaazing?" says Philbin, half delighted, half
wondering what the museum has gotten itself into.</TE>
<TE>   Down on the stage they pause at a large sign, about 10 feet high.
The words "Wednesday Night" are twisted into white neon tubing
against a blue background. Takahashi wants to place it on the wall at
the rear of the viewing area.</TE>
<TE>   "How hot will it get?" Wirth asks.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," Takahashi says. "I'm not sure it works yet."</TE>
<TE>   "My concern is that people will be quite close to it, and it might
get too hot," Wirth says. "We'd have to get the fire marshal to come
in again to look at it."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, we want as few problems with the fire marshal as possible,"
Philbin says. After all, the authorities have already determined it's
too dangerous for visitors to wander amid the display--they could get
cut or bruised or have things fall on them--so viewers will be issued
binoculars and restricted to the back of the auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   Philbin suggests an alternative. "What about putting it here?" She
waves at the stage area where they are standing. "This looks like a
good place for it. Perhaps we could hang it up on the wall. Then we
wouldn't have any problems with the fire marshal."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want it here; I want it over there," Takahashi insists
firmly.</TE>
<TE>   "What about the other side of this wall?" Philbin finally suggests
to a still reluctant artist. The other side is what people will see
as they first enter the space from the courtyard. Takahashi likes the
idea.</TE>
<TE>   "But will it fit?" Philbin asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, yes, it'll fit," Takahashi says. "I've measured this wall
before."</TE>
<TE>   For the last half-dozen years, Takahashi has made a name for
herself in Europe by taking stuff other people don't want--heaps and
heaps of it--and organizing it into sprawling "art walks" at
galleries, museums and commercial sites. Two years ago, she was
nominated for Britain's prestigious Turner Prize. Tokyo-born and
raised, she went to England 12 years ago--with her American
boyfriend, she admits reluctantly-- and eventually studied at the
Slade School of Fine Art and Goldsmiths' College. A penchant for
castoffs came naturally.</TE>
<TE>   "That's really classic," she says, "because we don't have money
but we need materials, we go to skips." Skips are the English
equivalent of dumpsters.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed for work in a spaghetti-strap top, baggy shorts and work
boots, Takahashi, 36, is an intense, wiry woman with long, frizzy
hair and metal-rimmed glasses. She gets plenty of exercise, she says,
from lifting and moving objects small and large and sometimes very
heavy. Take the airplane. It was donated by a friend of a friend.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a huge operation, but when we picked it up, it was just
the two of us, with a dolly," she boasts. Later it took a crew of 10
to cart it into the auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   In L.A. she has been happy to find plenty of places where she
could get things free or nearly free--sign and prop shops, dumpsters,
referrals and listings in the Recycler. Two assistants have been
assigned to her, one to do the research and coordinate pickups,
another to drive her around in a truck to find and retrieve the
stuff.</TE>
<TE>   Two days ago, Takahashi went on a spending spree--she spent $50
for a groaning truckload of old electronics equipment from CalArts.
"For all this stuff," she says, with some satisfaction, "I spent
$100."</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, Takahashi's work has been shown in New York
at Staff Gallery and the Drawing Center and recently as part of a
group exhibition, "Sprawl," at the Contemporary Arts Center in
Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Although she has shown once before in Los Angeles (a sculpture and
photo collages at Grant Selwyn in 1999), this is her first
installation on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   The Hammer expects that the current project will yield "a highly
idiosyncratic 'map' of our city."</TE>
<TE>   Takahashi, however, is noticeably hesitant when she talks about
her work--she's not sure yet what she intends to do with her L.A. raw
material.</TE>
<TE>   "Here you can't really focus, because there's so many focuses,"
she says. "It's so huge, and people are strangely isolated and
scattered."</TE>
<TE>   She admits she's feeling edgy. Right after this interview, she
says, she plans to go incommunicado for two weeks, working at all
hours of the day and night as the spirit moves her. Too bad she can't
camp out here, the way she's done at other installations--orders of
the fire marshal.</TE>
<TE>   She's more willing to discuss previous installations, and it's
clear that themes in her work arise from place and circumstance. At
London's Hales Gallery in 1998, she created an installation overrun
with clocks and their ticking. "I was really preoccupied with the
time because my visa was expiring," she explains.</TE>
<TE>   In "Authorized for Removal," at the Old Bethnal Green Police
Station, in 1997, she painted dotted lines on the floor where objects
had been, as if marking a corpse.</TE>
<TE>   Despite accolades for her work, there are plenty of critics who
are willing to point out the obvious: She's working with trash.</TE>
<TE>   Takahashi is sensitive to the point. When she catches herself
using the word "rubbish" for the things she has found, she clarifies.
"I don't really want to say rubbish because it's such a rubbish
word," she says. "They're ... things on the street. I don't believe
they're rubbish, that's why I brought these things back."</TE>
<TE>   Asked what will happen to it all when the show is over, Claudia
Ise, the Hammer curator in charge of the show, laughs and says,
"There will be a huge dismantling process."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Takahashi has a more creative suggestion. "I had an idea
to do a 99-cents shop after this show," she says. "On the spot,
people would come and choose anything for 99 cents."</TE>
<TE>   Again, the flight of artistic vision meets the thud of practical
reality: "We couldn't do that because people can't walk down here,"
she says. "It's a pity, it was such a nice idea."</TE>
<TE>   "Tomoko Takahashi: Auditorium Piece" opens Sunday, UCLA Hammer
Museum, 10899 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles. (310) 443-7000. Through
Jan. 5.</TE>

<HD>Passions Overflow in 'Children of Century'</HD>
<DH>George Sand and Alfred de Musset's tempestuous romance
makes for a bravura film by Diane Kurys.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century became
a time of turmoil that stirred the spirit of revolution in art and
politics. In "Children of the Century," Diane Kurys' bravura film of
the tempestuous love story of George Sand and Alfred de Musset, two
of the major literary figures of their time, Kurys felicitously
defines Romanticism as an expression of the postwar conflict between
idealism and cynicism. Like such English Romantics as Byron, Keats
and Shelley, Sand and Musset practiced what they preached: They lived
lives as passionate as the poetry, plays and novels inspired by them.
(Sand's subsequent romance with Chopin, however, is more familiar and
the subject of various films.)</LD>
<LD>   In this sumptuous, large-scale period piece, Kurys audaciously
risks wearying an audience with the constantly seesawing romance of a
couple who exhaust each other with the intensity of their emotions to
suggest how long it takes for a red-hot love to cool down, at which
point it becomes clear that the embers will never really stop
glowing. What Juliette Binoche's fiery yet regal Sand discovers by
the end of the film, however, justifies its demanding, nearly two
hours of two people determined to live on the cutting edge of their
emotions--and her discovery is just as true for those who live far
more conventional lives.</LD>
<TE>   It is at a June 1833 Paris salon reading, from her second novel,
"Lelia," that Sand and Musset (Benoit Magimel) meet. By that time the
Baroness Duvedant had forsaken her loveless marriage of nine years
and moved to Paris with her two small children. She adopted the pen
name George Sand and affected men's attire when making professional
appearances; she also smoked cigars, in public as well as in private.
In her Sand mode, she regales that Parisian salon audience with her
declaration that marriage is a form of slavery and that husbands find
it easier to accuse their wives of frigidity than to try to ensure
that they experience sexual pleasure. Much of audience is predictably
scandalized, but Musset, seven years' Sand's junior, is impressed.</TE>
<TE>   They connect instantly, both intellectually and sexually, but
instinctively try to back off, realizing that they could be igniting
emotions that might well overpower them. Naturally, delaying tactics
only fan the flames, making their succumbing to each other all the
more inevitable. They are actually of radically different
temperaments. For all her flair for scandal, Sand actually preferred
a rural life, close to nature, while Musset was an incurable urban
party animal.</TE>
<TE>   Sand may have been a woman of many liaisons, but she is
nonetheless a disciplined professional intent on trying to earn a
living by her pen. By contrast, Musset asks an exasperated Sand,
"Can't you see I need to live boldly to write well?" She does, but
her idea of living boldly is to be an activist in feminist causes and
to practice free love openly, while his is to live hard, spending any
substantial amount of time Sand cannot devote to him by haunting
casinos and brothels and indulging mightily in alcohol and opium. In
essence Sand is a mature woman, aware of the possible consequences of
her defiant behavior and attitudes, and one who embraces life
joyously and full of laughter. Bleak and despairing by nature, Musset
remains, no matter how he at times struggles to grow up, emotionally
immature and epically destructive to others as well as himself.</TE>
<TE>   If all this would seem a certain recipe for disaster for the
lovers, it also fueled their creativity to new heights. They were
honest and open to each other to such an extraordinary degree that it
is actually possible to see their presence in each other's work. As
for how their relationship played out, coming to a head during a
stormy stay in Venice, Kurys turned to their correspondence,
unavailable until the 20th century, to relate fully all its
convolutions and how others involved themselves in it to both
positive and negative effect. She found in it a more reliable
narrative thread than their own accounts of their relationship and
the various contradictory views expressed by those close to them.</TE>
<TE>   By now a well-established international star with an Oscar,
Binoche is the commanding presence of the film throughout and is
possessed of a grave beauty that would make her the perfect subject
for a likeness carved on a Victorian cameo brooch. Magimel, who
resembles Sean Penn beneath a mass of curls, counterpoints the innate
strength Binoche brings to Sand with a Musset who easily careens out
of control. Caught in the middle is the handsome Venetian doctor
Pietro Pagello (Stefano Dionisi), who saves Musset's life when he
nearly dies of his excesses but also falls in love with Sand.</TE>
<TE>   "Children of the Century" is elegant in the utmost, aglow with
Vilko Filac's gorgeous camera work and sustained crucially by Luis
Bacalov's vital, flowing score that echoes the film's ever-shifting
moods. Francois Olivier Rousseau and actor-writer-singer-songwriter
Murray Head, best remembered for "Sunday Bloody Sunday," collaborated
with Kurys on the script. Kurys is well-known for the
autobiographical films that launched her in the '70s and '80s, and
the similarly intimate films that followed. In scope, ambition and
accomplishment, "Children of the Century" therefore takes Kurys'
career to a whole new level.</TE>

<HD>Risks Behind the Camera Make 'Biggie' Riveting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANOHLA DARGIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Nick Broomfield's documentary "Biggie &amp; Tupac" screened at
Sundance last January, it wasn't just one of the best films at the
festival, it was one of the better documentaries I'd seen in years. A
gripping investigation into the murders of rap rivals and former
friends Tupac Shakur and Christopher Wallace, a.k.a. the Notorious
B.I.G., Broomfield's feature bristles with the sort of passion and
bold purpose so often lacking in contemporary nonfiction filmmaking;
it plays like a suspense thriller because that's exactly what it is.</LD>
<LD>   Crammed with talking-head interviews and extensive archival
footage, the documentary interweaves two mysteries--the unsolved
fatal shooting of Shakur on Sept. 7, 1996, and that of Wallace some
six months later--to tell the story of two young men caught in the
cross-hairs of intrigue and greed. Principally shot by Broomfield's
longtime camerawoman (and ex-wife), Joan Churchill, with sound
recording by the director, the film employs the documentarian's
standard operating procedure: Talking his way through the film,
Broomfield bops in front of the camera, wearing earphones while
lugging a tape recorder and boom, bursting and sometimes blundering
into one nerve-shredding situation after another. He elicits outrage
and confession, then seamlessly patches it all together.</LD>
<TE>   Sometimes the approach doesn't work, as in 1998's "Kurt &amp;
Courtney," an unpersuasive attempt to link Courtney Love to the death
of her late husband, Kurt Cobain. But when it does work--as it does
with this new film and earlier features such as "Driving Me
Crazy"--the results are winning, even when the director is somewhat
less so. Broomfield tends to rub people the wrong way, in part
because the face time he puts into his documentaries makes him come
across as an unreconstructed narcissist. His British accent probably
doesn't help, although it's a good guess one reason so many of his
American subjects give it up so readily is that, like many of their
compatriots, they're suckers for that Brahmin whine.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the critical displeasure with Broomfield may also be his
pushiness. On American screens, documentaries generally come in two
variants--the fly-on-the-wall type, and the hodgepodge sort familiar
from television, in which voices of authority silkily narrate over
artfully assembled interviews and archival material. Unless the
camera is in the capable hands of someone like Frederick Wiseman,
most of these films don't assume an aggressive or intellectually
probing attitude, in the manner of classic cinema verite; they're
observational not confrontational.</TE>
<TE>   Broomfield's manner and methodology, on the other hand, range from
the insinuating to the combative, a style that puts him more in the
camp of New Journalism than HBO's "America Undercover." He's gutsy
when it comes to his subjects and when it comes to his own failings,
as when in the new film he admits during one interview,
"Unfortunately, we ran out of sound." The admissions can sound coy,
at times disingenuous, but they go hand in hand with the intently
personal nature of his work, which at its best makes you understand
that something is at stake beyond the filmmaker's reputation.</TE>
<TE>   In "Biggie &amp; Tupac," Broomfield's accent and pushiness (or
naivete), along with his reckless disregard for personal safety--his
and that of everyone else on the crew--united with Churchill's gift
for seizing on images that count, make for galvanizing viewing. You
don't just get to watch the director run numerous red lights in
pursuit of the truth or at least the shot, you watch him ask one of
Shakur's former bodyguards if he's going to turn his Rottweilers on
him. (It's a wonder no one clocks Broomfield.) Surely the most
frightening moment in movies this year isn't the return of Hannibal
Lecter, it's the image of Death Row Records founder Suge Knight
lumbering across a prison field, a walking stick grasped in one hand,
a fat cigar in the other.</TE>
<TE>   The scene comes late in the documentary. By then, Broomfield has
conducted several interviews with people who are visibly nervous,
even afraid, but nothing compares to the palpable fear that pervades
the encounter with Knight. It's no wonder that the interim cameraman
(Churchill refused to go) can't keep the camera from shaking.</TE>
<TE>   Since its premiere at Sundance, "Biggie &amp; Tupac" and its
hypothesis about Shakur and Wallace's deaths being linked to Knight,
gang members and corrupt members of the Los Angeles Police Department
have come under renewed scrutiny because of a story on the Shakur
murder published in the L.A. Times last month. Written by staff
writer Chuck Philips, the two-part inquiry posited that the East
Coast-based Wallace offered to pay Crips gangbangers a million-dollar
bounty to kill his West Coast rival Shakur. Friends and family of
Wallace have condemned Philips' report, and rap impresario Russell
Simmons, chairman of the activist Hip-Hop Summit Action Network, has
called the allegations about Wallace "inaccurate, untrue and
unsubstantiated."</TE>
<TE>   As far as the documentary and its essential truth go, none of this
means all that much, even if Broomfield and Philips do sometimes
point in wildly different directions. One of Broomfield's most
crucial interviewees, former LAPD Det. Russell Poole, lays out the
theory that Knight is directly behind the Shakur murder and that Los
Angeles police were involved in Wallace's death. (Poole is also a
source for "Labyrinth," a recent book about the two killings by
Randall Sullivan.) Philips, in turn, relying on unnamed sources for
his account of Shakur's murder, claims that Crips gang members
orchestrated the rapper's death in revenge for an earlier grievance.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, for all their differences, what Broomfield and Philips agree
on is that unsavory characters are part of this story, including
various law enforcement officers. In the end, at the core of each and
every story concerning the deaths of Shakur and Wallace is the
nightmare of the music industry itself, which tolerated and supported
recording companies run by thugs, peopled by active gang members and
institutionally supported by bad cops. No matter how and why the
murders went down it was ugly business that earns the final blame for
the deaths of these two men.</TE>

<HD>Not a Match Made in 'Heaven'</HD>
<DH>'Run Lola Run's' director is ill-suited to the lyrical
story of a woman killer and the cop who loves her.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANOHLA DARGIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The story of a bombshell bomber and the lovesick policeman who saves
her, "Heaven" was directed by Tom Tykwer, the German wunderkind who a
few years back put his native cinema on the MTV generation's map with
the enjoyable trifle "Run Lola Run." All razzle-dazzle technique,
"Lola" is a gimmick movie--part video game, part steeplechase--about
a young woman who literally races through the story to save her
nitwit boyfriend from certain disaster.</LD>
<LD>   The film was as irresistible (and inconsequential) as a hooky
radio hit, an art-house smash in an age of art-house irrelevance that
turned Tykwer into the Next Big European Thing, at least on this side
of the pond.</LD>
<LD>   Yet if "Run Lola Run" showed Tykwer had a sure grasp of pop
culture, its insistent drive and mutability, you got the sense that
if he stayed in one place for long, he would soon be stranded in the
shallows of his imagination. The subsequent release of two other
features by him, an exercise in style over meaning called
"Wintersleepers" and the lugubrious romance "The Princess and the
Warrior," did little to ease doubts about Tykwer's gifts.</LD>
<TE>   There was enough in both films, hints of visual intelligence and a
willingness to slow to the tempo of real life, to suggest he might be
able to do justice (or at least little harm) to his next project,
"Heaven," based on a screenplay co-written by the late Polish
director Krzysztof Kieslowski. As it happens, however, Tykwer's
surface flash isn't just a poor fit with Kieslowski's lyrical
pessimism; it completely contradicts everything Kieslowski's work
aspired to, including the condition of art.</TE>
<TE>   In "Heaven," Cate Blanchett stars as Philippa, a British
schoolteacher living in Turin, Italy, who tries to avenge her dead
husband by killing his drug dealer. She leaves a bomb in a
wastebasket in the dealer's office, but fate transports the device
into an elevator carrying a father, his two young daughters and the
innocent agent of this tragedy, a cleaning woman. After her arrest,
Philippa learns of her mistake and sheds a couple of tears that are
tenderly if somewhat hastily wiped away by a carabiniere with the
providential name of Filippo (Giovanni Ribisi). Instantly smitten,
Filippo arranges for Philippa's escape from a law enforcement agency
that for its sheer comic ineptitude is matched only by the Keystone
Kops.</TE>
<TE>   Written shortly before Kieslowski's death in 1996, "Heaven" was
the first feature in a proposed trilogy by the late director and his
long-term writing partner, Krzysztof Piesiewicz. (Piesiewicz went on
to finish the screenplays for "Hell" and "Purgatory" with another
writer.) In interviews, Tykwer has charted the course of the project,
explaining how, in the course of developing the script, the original
60-page text was first translated from Polish into French, then
English, then German, then English again. It was at that point that
he and one of the film's 15 assorted producers, British director
Anthony Minghella, joined forces to hone the final version.</TE>
<TE>   Although his focus shifted over the years, Kieslowski maintained a
keen interest in the divide between the secular and the spiritual,
whether in his masterpiece, "The Decalogue," based on the Ten
Commandments, or in "Three Colors," a triptych of features based on
the ideals represented by the French tricolor. In "Blue," the most
wrenching feature in the trilogy, yet another widow engulfed in grief
recovers a sense of self only when she helps to finish her husband's
uncompleted concerto. The act of creation liberates her from her past
but doesn't provide her with an obvious happy ending; as with many of
Kieslowski's characters, she remains shrouded in ambiguity.</TE>
<TE>   There's no such uncertainty in "Heaven," which doesn't have the
courage of its conceit, only an abundance of bad ideas and worse
taste. After she's arrested, Philippa explains that she was not only
trying to avenge her husband's death, she was also going after a
dealer who sold drugs to children. That's dubious logic even for a
sociopath. What makes it worse is that because the filmmakers are
more interested in making Philippa likable than in exploring moral
ambiguity and the distance between chance and choice, they don't just
try to excuse her violence with appeals to vigilante justice, they
try to shape her into a figure of romantic tragedy. It's a
transformation that's as spurious as it is offensive, and one that
becomes more ridiculous with every scene.</TE>
<TE>   Still, given the fuss over the screenplay, the great irony of the
film is that it feels most urgent and plausible in its quieter
opening scenes, when we see Philippa setting the bomb in her
apartment, then marching toward the dealer's skyscraper office. The
resolve etched in her face seems as lethal as the bomb in her satchel
and every bit as mysterious. She isn't doing much talking at this
point, just exchanging words with the dealer's assistant, whom she
saves from death, and the police, whom she calls to declare her
guilt. The scenes have a tough, tingly authenticity: You're watching
a killer at work, and she doesn't look a bit sorry. Then the bomb
explodes, the director's credit materializes, and "Heaven" begins its
agonizing journey straight to cinematic hell.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R for a scene of sexuality. Times guidelines: The sex
scene is filmed from a distance and in silhouette; more graphic and
disturbing is the brutal murder of an unarmed man.</TE>

<HD>The Flecktones Entertain in Eclectic Fashion</HD>
<DH>At UCLA, Bela Fleck's group speeds up, then slows tempos
and varies ensemble pieces and solos.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bela Fleck's music may elude definition, but there's no denying his
capacity to put together an engaging performance.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday night at UCLA's Royce Hall, in one of the high
points, thus far, of the Verizon Music Festival, the world's most
versatile banjo player led his group--the Flecktones--in more than 2
1/2 hours of music (without intermission), touching everything from
bluegrass, rock, funk and jazz to a brief classical exposition.</LD>
<LD>   The Flecktones have been together for more than a decade, with
bassist Victor Wooten and his brother, percussionist Roy "Future Man"
Wooten (who performs on his own unique invention, the Drumitar), in
the quartet from the beginning, and saxophonist Jeff Coffin a more
recent addition. Their longevity traces to an effective combination
of group togetherness, individual instrumental virtuosity and
well-planned programming.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the length of the Royce performance, for example, Fleck
and his players sustained audience interest by offering a
quick-change series of contrasting elements. They began with several
up-tempo numbers seemingly dedicated to the proposition that if fast
is good, then faster is better. Then, rapidly shifting gears, they
moved into a less frenetic, early Flecktone piece, the whimsically
titled "Mars Needs Women."</TE>
<TE>   As the program continued, ensemble pieces were interspersed with
lengthy solo inventions from each of the players: a funk-driven,
string-snapping bass excursion by Victor Wooten; a kaleidoscopic
display of percussion--both electronic and acoustic--by "Future Man";
a genre-leaping set of choruses from Coffin, in which he bounded from
blues to avant-garde, doing a two-saxophones-at-the-same-time segment
reminiscent of Rahsaan Roland Kirk; and Fleck's own climactic spot,
in which he included Bach, bluegrass, casual musical meandering and
an audience sing-along in Lennon &amp; McCartney's "All You Need Is
Love."</TE>
<TE>   It was, by any estimation, an impressive presentation, marred only
occasionally by a tendency to base too much of the soloing, for too
extended periods of time, upon repetitious vamp patterns.</TE>
<TE>   But the Flecktones made up for this occasional transgression by
also playing tunes with shifting, complex meters and colorful
harmonies.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever one chose to call it or define it, their music did an
impressive job of walking the difficult razor's edge between art and
entertainment.</TE>

<HD>A Seductive Remake of 'Forsyte Saga'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>War with Iraq and problems in other potential hot spots loom, the
economy is depressing, the stock market woeful. With 2002 a throbbing
ache, escape to the past is especially seductive.</LD>
<LD>   So right on cue comes John Galsworthy's Victorians in a stunning,
if cast-flawed, remake of the "The Forsyte Saga," drawn from three
volumes he wrote early in the last century.</LD>
<LD>   A BBC adaptation first landed in the late 1960s as a celebrated
26-part marathon in England before transferring to public television
in the U.S. and creating a zest here for costume drama from the
Brits.</LD>
<TE>   Viewers with selective memories swear by the relatively
rudimentary earlier production that was telecast in black and white.
Anglophiles recall it fondly as the impetus for "Masterpiece
Theater," which would get famous on PBS by waving the Union Jack.</TE>
<TE>   Now comes "The Forsyte Saga" anew, this one from Granada
Television, as "Masterpiece Theatre" looks to its own roots in a fall
TV season already tilting toward nostalgia of a more plebeian kind.
Opening with a two-hour splash to be followed by one-hour episodes on
six successive Sundays, "The Forsyte Saga" is TV's version of a
scrumptious novel, in some ways trashy, that you can't put down as it
chronicles three generations of a family. Once sorted out (have
patience), its high-toned Londoners and their thundering crises
provide a welcome distraction from these distressing times. And in
more good news, "The Forsyte Saga" is being extended in a subsequent
Granada production now in the works.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of today's global havoc, better turbulence comes from this
cloister of mostly snooty, pretentious top-hatters whose
relationships are defined by money and class, even though the
Forsytes themselves are hardly an old family with standing, being
just (sniff, sniff) several generations into wealth.</TE>
<TE>   Oxford accents are rarely tonier, upper lips rarely stiffer than
here. What are this crowd's priorities? As one doddering Forsyte aunt
huffs: "The loss of a husband is nothing [compared] to the loss of a
good butler."</TE>
<TE>   You get gentlemen being gentlemen here, in an environment where a
fellow can make his way if he can inherit enough capital. You also
get silken gaiety contrasting with polite society's impoliteness.
Directed beautifully by Christopher Menaul and David Moore, and
adapted by Jan McVerry and Stephen Mallatratt, this is just the
ticket for Sunday nights.</TE>
<TE>   It's scintillating soap opera in bustles, tails, stiff collars and
cravats, a tangle of betrayals turning largely on Soames Forsyte's
(Damian Lewis) destructive infatuation with impoverished Irene (Gina
McKee) in an atmosphere of panoramic lushness. She weds Soames for
his fortune and loathes him. Their childless marriage is calamitous
in this impressively staged story, one whose tragedies, for him, her
and others, multiply and converge.</TE>
<TE>   And no wonder, for even as Soames loves Irene to the point of
obsession, she loves architect Philip Bosinney (Ioan Gruffudd), and
later Soames' cousin, Young Jolyon Forsyte (Rupert Graves). Young
Jolyon's daughter, June (Gillian Kearney), also loves Bosinney, who
loves Irene. Young Jolyon's wife loves him, but he loves his young
daughter's nanny, Helene Hilmer (Amanda Ooms), before falling for
Irene. Young Jolyon's father, Old Jolyon Forsyte (Corin Redgrave),
also adores Irene. Soames' sister, Winifred (Amanda Root), loves her
husband, Montague Dartie (Ben Miles), a worthless bounder who
(bummer) loves only booze, money, gambling and other women.</TE>
<TE>   Then they have tea.</TE>
<TE>   Although most performances here are admirable, the actor to relish
most is Lewis, whose Yankspeak was impeccable as American Maj.
Richard Winters in last season's "Band of Brothers" on HBO.</TE>
<TE>   His repressed Soames is more magnetic and interesting to behold,
walking rigidly at attention in his dark suit of clothes, his manner
funereal, only his eyes hinting at the implosions beneath his leaden
demeanor. In fact, he's Vesuvius ready to blow.</TE>
<TE>   A partner in the family's law firm, Soames is a hypocrite who
projects moral superiority. He is so tightly coiled that at one point
he draws blood while biting his lip in anger. He is diffident,
judgmental, cold and superficially arrogant, treating even some
members of his family as clerks.</TE>
<TE>   "Damn Soames with thousands in the bank and nothing in his soul,"
the adult June says about her cousin, whose glints of humanity
surface only near the end of these eight hours.</TE>
<TE>   His opposite is her father, soulful Young Jolyon, who early in the
story forsakes a life of privilege by running off with Helene and
becoming a bohemian artist. Despite their blemished pasts, in fact,
Young Jolyon and Old Jolyon are ultimately the story's most honorable
characters.</TE>
<TE>   "The Forsyte Saga" is scarred by a pair of casting choices, the
least damaging of which has Kearney playing Young Jolyon's daughter
as an adult even though she and Graves appear about the same age.</TE>
<TE>   More critical is the miscasting of McKee as Irene, the character
who drives much of the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to win over his wife with grand new surroundings, Soames
decides to build her a mansion in the country. His decision to hire
Bosinney to design it backfires, throwing Irene and the young
architect together.</TE>
<TE>   There's a wonderful ballroom scene with Irene and Bosinney gliding
across the floor eye to eye, the intensity of their bond captured in
the shocked expressions of those observing their hothouse behavior.
Having the camera not dwell on the smitten couple is wise directing,
for the chemistry supposedly binding Bosinney and Irene is
nonexistent on the screen.</TE>
<TE>   McKee's pivotal Irene is not just a dent but a gaping pothole in
this saga of Forsytes. Although tall and graceful, can she be the
"Goddess" that Galsworthy describes? The face that launches male
libidos and has Bosinney vowing, "I would grub my fingers in the
soil, sell my soul to spend my life with you?" The erotic force that
has Soames so revved up that he ultimately stalks her like a
nighttime Ripper in the warrens of lower-class London? Has him so
consumed that after she leaves him, he dances alone in a room while
clinging to her red ball gown?</TE>
<TE>   It's a testament to the material's strength, and its handling
here, that "The Forsyte Saga" still manages to succeed. No disrespect
to present host Russell Baker, but it's almost as if Alistair Cooke
had returned and "Masterpiece Theatre" were again offering TV's

<HD>Struggling MSNBC Rethinking Its Lineup</HD>
<DH>Television* The cable channel's summer overhaul, including
Phil Donahue's return, didn't meet expectations. And how to deal with
Iraq?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cable news channel MSNBC this week started discussing changes to its
lineup, after its summer programming overhaul failed to make much of
an impression on viewers.</LD>
<LD>   Most prominently, under one scenario being considered, Ashleigh
Banfield would end up losing her nightly "On Location" (7 p.m. on the
West Coast), which has fared poorly in recent weeks while she has
been on a tour of America.</LD>
<LD>   Likewise, the news channel is talking about moving Jerry Nachman's
hourlong show (4 p.m. on the West Coast), which leads into prime time
on the East Coast, perhaps to a less desirable daytime slot. As the
editor in chief of MSNBC, Nachman is participating in the talks.</LD>
<TE>   As for Phil Donahue, whose widely heralded return to television
hasn't lifted the channel as much as had been hoped, he is expected
to spend much more time in front of a studio audience, as he did in
his long-running daytime talk show, starting later in the month.</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC spokeswoman Cheryl Daly declined to discuss any changes
except to note that, with the conflict in Iraq heating up, MSNBC
programmers "are looking at the schedule and devoting more air time
to that story. We need to expand our coverage."</TE>
<TE>   Daly said that the network was looking at carving out at least an
hour daily for Iraq coverage, but no time slot had been decided on.</TE>
<TE>   As for Banfield, Daly noted any changes will have to wait.
Banfield will cover the upcoming midterm elections and then go to the
Middle East, Daly said, "for that program, for that time slot."</TE>

<HD>An Old Testament Tale Gets a Fresh, Crisp Retelling</HD>
<DH>The kids' video series called VeggieTales has its first
big-screen release in a smart and funny version of the story of
Jonah.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Go ahead, blame it on Mr. Potato Head if you must, but having
vegetables dress up and act like humans has always been hard to
resist. When irreverent edibles tell sly jokes and go by names like
Archibald Asparagus and Bob the Tomato, they can get away with almost
anything. Even teaching kids to do the right thing.</LD>
<LD>   The VeggieTales series of tapes has been doing just that since
1993, selling so many units (more than 30 million) that it has become
this country's top-selling direct-to-video series. Yes, the tales
present lessons about ethical behavior, but they insist on being
smart and funny at the same time. Says Phil Vischer, who writes and
directs along with Mike Nawrocki, "We've always described VeggieTales
as what might happen if Monty Python took over Hebrew or Sunday
school."</LD>
<LD>   Now we have "Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie," and what a pleasant
surprise it is. With Vischer and Nawrocki, both Bible college
dropouts, having a hand in the film's numerous songs and doing many
of the vegetables' voices, this animated retelling of the familiar
Old Testament story is playful, high-spirited and unmistakably
amusing. It's nice to see that a sense of humor and a sense of values
don't inevitably have to cancel each other out.</LD>
<TE>   Using bright computer-generated visuals, "Jonah" surrounds its
biblical tale with a modern framing story. A VW bus is spied on a
lonely country road, taking four eager children and two supervising
adults--if you can call Bob the Tomato and Dad Asparagus adults--to a
sold-out concert by the super-popular rock star Twippo.</TE>
<TE>   But because Dad Asparagus is enthusiastically playing the guitar
and hitting Bob the Tomato with the neck instead of reading the map,
the gang gets lost and ends up at a strange seafood restaurant, where
their bickering and general unhappiness catch the attention of a
mysterious nautical trio who call themselves the Pirates Who Don't Do
Anything.</TE>
<TE>   Pointing to the items "compassion" and "mercy" on the menu (I said
it was a strange restaurant), the Pirates decide to teach the kids
what those words mean by recalling one time, a long time ago, when
"we did one thing with one guy." A guy named Jonah.</TE>
<TE>   Expanding with great glee on the biblical tale, "Jonah" gives its
protagonist a back story as a working prophet who took enormous pride
in the prestige that went with delivering messages from God to his
neighbors in Joppa. Wearing a monocle, speaking with a posh British
accent and riding around on a camel named Reginald, Jonah shows off
in the song "Message From the Lord," where the good word from the
deity is distilled to a syncopated "Do not fight, do not cheat, wash
your hands before your feet."</TE>
<TE>   But when the Lord sends Jonah to Nineveh, the prophet balks. "You
don't know what it's like there," he protests to God about a foreign
city so mean and ornery that the residents slap one another with fish
at the slightest provocation. He hires those pirates, who break a
lifelong dedication to doing nothing to take him as far away from
Nineveh as he can get.</TE>
<TE>   On the pirates' ship, Jonah runs into an affable creature named
Khalil, who says, "My mother was a caterpillar and my father was a
worm, but I'm OK with that now." A traveling salesman who religiously
listens to motivational tapes, Khalil views becoming Jonah's
"traveling buddy" as a great opportunity to sell licensed
merchandise. "You are huge, you are a celebrity," he tells the
prophet. "You give the message, I sell the plush toys."</TE>
<TE>   When that celebrated storm comes up, a game of Go Fish is called
for to determine who to cast into the sea. In goes Jonah, along with
a rubber ducky and Khalil, who he insists on calling Carlisle. Inside
the belly of the beast, they come across a massive gospel choir that
delivers the message of the film: "The Lord is the God of second
chances, he can rescue you from desperate circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   Writer-directors Vischer and Nawrocki enjoy creating characters
with accents (French-flavored peas and a Scottish travel agent among
them), and lace "Jonah" with modern references to snack foods and
adult jokes about balanced stock portfolios.</TE>
<TE>   Bright to the end, "Jonah" closes with a "No vegetable was harmed
in the making of this film" disclaimer and a closing "The Credit
Song," which bemoans the fact that songs under the credits never have
anything to do with the movie just seen. Even atheists can smile at
that one, and, to a surprising extent, at the rest of "Jonah" as
well.</TE>
<TE>   *MPAA rating: G. Times guidelines: suitable for all audiences.</TE>

<HD>Amy Grant Transforms Hymns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Lewis</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Christian music audiences aren't perfect, but they are forgiving.
That may be one reason Amy Grant felt she could take such liberties
with her religious music by making frequently exotic changes in
100-year-old hymns that are featured in her new "Legacy" album.</LD>
<LD>   She devoted a chunk of a 2 1/2-hour performance Tuesday at the
Vineyard church in Anaheim to songs from that album, drawing on
daring arrangements by Grant's husband, singer-guitarist-songwriter
Vince Gill, and other collaborators. Gill is sitting in on this tour
because Grant's longtime guitarist dropped out three weeks before it
opened.</LD>
<LD>   Gill recast the 17th century hymn "Fairest Lord Jesus" with what
Grant called "an acoustic Bo Diddley feel" at the outset, morphing
into a propulsive mountain music treatment that might be labeled "O
Father, Where Art Thou?" Her version of "Softly and Tenderly" was
built on a sinuous beat--part-calypso, part-New Orleans second-line
parade groove.</LD>
<TE>   Later, Gill set the church crowd absolutely atwitter with a new
song, "This Guitar and Me," that reminisces about his hardscrabble
days as a touring musician when "if we got lucky, we took a barmaid
home." The crowd oohed nervously but forgave him when he sheepishly
apologized. If onlookers were disappointed that the scant two numbers
featuring Gill didn't include one of his goose-bump-raising ballads,
they didn't show it.</TE>
<TE>   Grant, in a particularly chatty mood, supplemented the new
material with songs from throughout her two-decade-plus recording
career, her warm, lightly smoked alto more effective at conveying
heavenly bliss than mining earthly travail.</TE>

<HD>'Collinwood,' by Way of 'Madonna Street'</HD>
<DH>The comedy is genial and diverting, but it feeds off its
predecessor and offers little of its own that's tasty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANOHLA DARGIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the genial, low-wattage comedy "Welcome to Collinwood," a handful
of petty thieves and idlers try to break into a neighborhood jewelry
store thinking they've hit the criminal big time. Since that more or
less describes what happens, or at least the film's excuse for a
plot, it's up to the two young writer-directors, brothers Anthony and
Joe Russo, to fill out the balance with silly bits of business,
colorful atmosphere and quick- sketch characterizations, all of which
they do handily.</LD>
<LD>   There isn't much else to the film beyond slapstick antics and
professional gloss, but the results are diverting enough, in great
measure because it's essentially a scene-by-scene remake Mario
Monicelli's 1958 satire, "Big Deal on Madonna Street," a minor
classic about a handful of shifty archetypes scheming their way
through postwar Italy. (A parody of those caper films in which
nothing goes wrong, it's a film in which nothing goes right.)</LD>
<LD>   Against the dehumanizing backdrop of faceless apartment blocks,
the men and their women comically bicker and struggle, looking for
toeholds in the ravaged economy. One of the film's sharpest (and most
political) jokes is that some of these guys would rather sweat
through an elaborate robbery than face the horrors of an honest job.
Even better, says one, would be the life of a retired crime boss,
because you wouldn't have to do much except live off your past.</LD>
<TE>   Living off the past is, of course, the nature of remakes. "Welcome
to Collinwood" is at least the second iteration of "Big Deal on
Madonna Street," following Louis Malle's 1984 film "Crackers,"
although certainly other films have limned the same territory.
There's nothing wrong with living off the past, though it makes life
(and art) more interesting if you bring something new to the party,
the way that the Russos' heavyweight producers, Steven Soderbergh and
George Clooney, did with "Ocean's Eleven." "Welcome to Collinwood"
isn't offensive and it's often amusing, but it's too bad that none of
the smart, talented people involved in its creation didn't work
harder to come up with something that came from lived experience
rather than favorite movies.</TE>
<TE>   "Big Deal on Madonna Street" also sprang from the movies, yet what
makes it more than a parody of the sleek likes of "Rififi" is that
it's less about capers and satire and more about grasshoppers
desperate to avoid becoming ants. Although the Russos make the most
of their grasshoppers--a Sundance All-Star lineup that includes
William H. Macy, Sam Rockwell and Luis Guzman--and usually know where
to put the camera, their film might as well be set on a back lot, so
removed is it from the texture and vibrancy of life. Despite its
gritty Cleveland locations, it has the vacuum-sealed feel of a
student film bankrolled by rich uncles. One of those uncles, Clooney,
has a small role as a safecracker. Even when covered in jailhouse
tattoos, he's something to watch.</TE>
<TE>   *MPAA rating, R for language. Times guidelines: some quasi-Mamet
style profanity, but the film is fine for older teenagers who may
appreciate its Three Stooges silliness.</TE>

<LD>   Ex-Beatles to Team Up for Harrison Tribute</LD>
<LD>   Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr will headline a tribute concert in
memory of their late colleague George Harrison, officials announced
Thursday. The show at London's Royal Albert Hall is set for Nov. 29,
the first anniversary of his death, and will feature Tom Petty,
British pianist Jools Holland and Ravi Shankar, the sitar virtuoso
who greatly influenced Harrison.</LD>
<TE>   The concert, which Eric Clapton is helping to organize, will
feature a mix of Harrison's own music and his favorite songs.
Proceeds will go to the Material World Charitable Foundation, which
Harrison funded. The foundation supports the arts, music, education
and people with special needs. The former Beatle died of cancer last
year at 58.</TE>

<TE>   Hollywood's Palace</TE>
<TE>   Gets New Owners</TE>
<TE>   A Boston nightclub operator has taken over the Palace in
Hollywood. John Lyons, who helped launch the House of Blues chain,
and partner Steven Adelman bought the Palace from owner-president Kay
Neill, in a deal that was sealed Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Lyons declined to say how much they paid for the 75-year-old
facility, but said they plan to continue with "business as usual"
while he and Adelman evaluate the operation to determine what changes
they'll make. But, he said, "We won't be turning it into a Gap," and
said he expects to retain the mix of concerts and late-night dance
club activity hosted at the Palace in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Among the Boston clubs Lyons owns and operates is the Avalon
Ballroom, named the city's best dance club for three years running by
the editorial staff as well as the readers of Boston's City Search
Web site guide to nightlife. The Avalon also combines concerts and
dance club offerings.</TE>
<TE>   Lyons and his brother Patrick have been running nightclubs in the
Boston area since the 1970s. "One of the things that's very important
to us is not to try to foist upon the market some sort of culture
that works or exists elsewhere in the world," he said. "Whatever is
done in this marketplace has to be relevant, or even somewhat
indigenous, to this marketplace."</TE>

<TE>   Studio Plans Move Forward in Wales</TE>
<TE>   The Welsh Assembly has dropped its objections to plans to build a
$450-million movie studio complex in an area of south Wales.</TE>
<TE>   A consortium backed by actor-director Richard Attenborough wants
to build the complex on 350 acres at Llanilid, creating up to 2,000
jobs. The complex, to be called Dragon International Studios, will
have the latest facilities for making feature films, TV productions
and commercials.</TE>
<TE>   The Welsh government had blocked the development because of the
need for a new highway junction, but officials now say that problem
could be overcome. Local councils now must decide whether to approve
the plans. They've said in the past that they support the
development.</TE>

<TE>   'Les Miserables' to End Its Run on Broadway</TE>
<TE>   "Les Miserables," the longest-running show currently on Broadway,
will close in March.</TE>
<TE>   The show, which opened March 12, 1987, has been seen by an
estimated 9 million people and has brought in $390 million in ticket
sales, not counting touring productions. But lately, "Les Miz" has
been playing to half-empty houses, sometimes smaller.</TE>
<TE>   Its run, the second longest in Broadway history after "Cats"
(7,485 shows from 1982 to 2000), will end March 15, 2003, after the
show's 6,612th performance.</TE>

<HD>Writing Credit Changes Proposed</HD>
<DH>Movies* Writers Guild members will vote on rules updating
whose name appears where.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Writers Guild of America has released a set of proposed changes
for determining television and screenwriter credits, some of which
have already raised the ire of rank and file union members.</LD>
<LD>   The four proposed changes, which must be voted on by the Writers
Guild's 12,000 members, were sent out Thursday. Critics say the two
most controversial proposals would erode the importance traditionally
placed on the first writer of a script.</LD>
<LD>   The proposals include:</LD>
<TE>   * During determination of credits, writers would be anonymous to
the people deciding who will get credit. Currently, unless they
request anonymity, writers' names are placed on a script when credits
are being determined--something that could lend itself to favoritism.</TE>
<TE>   * When there is a disagreement over who should get credit for a
screenplay, a group of arbiters will decide and list writers' names
according to who made the most substantial contribution to the
material. If the arbiters cannot decide who made the most significant
contributions, the screenwriters' names will be listed in
chronological order of when they worked on the script.</TE>
<TE>   * The third, and one of the most controversial proposals,
clarifies an existing rule in a way critics feel de-emphasizes the
primacy of the writer who adapts a screenplay from other material.
Under the proposed change, that writer will not automatically get
credit for simply picking up elements from previously published
material.</TE>
<TE>   * Another controversial proposal would make it easier for
directors or producers who also write to receive credit.
Historically, to prevent producers and directors from usurping credit
from writers, the guild had set a heightened requirement for them to
prove they had written 50% or more of a script to receive credit. In
recent years, some of the most successful writers have also become
directors and producers and feel unfairly penalized because of the
guild's rule. The new proposal would allow these writers to be held
to the same standard as other writers with some safeguards.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing that writers can control in this industry is the
credits," said Stephen Schiff ("True Crime"), co-chairman of the
credits review committee. "It is our duty to make them fair and make
them mean something. We are not trying to divide the union or
politicize the union, we are just trying to make the credits as true
and meaningful as they can be."</TE>
<TE>   But critics of the proposed changes say that they will take credit
away from the people who are the first writers of scripts. In
Hollywood, where most scriptwriters work on a freelance basis,
getting a green light for a script can be an arduous process, said
J.F. Lawton ("Pretty Woman"), who resigned from the credits review
committee six months ago in protest.</TE>
<TE>   "Some writers spend years trying to get a project set up," said
Lawton. "When you finally get it set up then a high-profile,
well-connected, famous writer can jump in and, in a month, take
credit from you. That happens all the time."</TE>
<TE>   The rewriters are usually brought in to reorganize a story or put
finishing touches on a script. Some high-profile scriptwriters are
paid between $150,000 to $250,000 a week for their work. Some credits
can also trigger hefty bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   Lawton said rewriting is different from first writing and should
get appropriate credit.</TE>
<TE>   "The hard work of writing is construction and form and dialogue,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Schiff said Lawton is trying to politicize the union.</TE>
<TE>   "It think it is very dangerous for anyone to try to divide the
union into a union of first writers and rewriters," he said. "We are
all writers and we work in a collaborative industry."</TE>
<TE>   The vote on the proposals is scheduled for Nov. 14.</TE>

<HD>Elliott Smith, Daniel Lanois Play It Heartfelt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Singer-songwriters Daniel Lanois and Elliott Smith each struck
emotionally honest chords during a Tuesday benefit concert at the
Echo nightclub in Echo Park. But the Canadian uber-producer evoked
moods with atmospheric music, while the American cult hero squeezed
hearts with plaintive confessions.</LD>
<LD>   Smith was clearly the main attraction, as a line of devotees
snaked around the block hours before his set, hoping to pay just $15
(proceeds went toward paying medical bills for Spaceland and Echo
booker Jennifer Tefft) to see him in an intimate environment.</LD>
<LD>   The Portland, Ore., native became an indie sensation with his
first three albums. Then he released two albums on DreamWorks Records
after his tune "Miss Misery," from the 1997 movie "Good Will
Hunting," was nominated for a best song Oscar. Tuesday's folk-and
blues-flavored solo acoustic set lasted about an hour, with older
works blending into material from a long-awaited follow-up (which
still has no release date) to 2000's "Figure 8."</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, Smith seemed more comfortable in the role of unassuming
troubadour than that of the giddy rocker from his 2000 show at the
Wiltern Theatre. Yet the songs' isolation, longing and bitterness
felt more forceful and resilient, as his thin tenor was more assured,
underscoring the comforting quality of his often mournful-feeling
tunes.</TE>
<TE>   Lanois, who recently signed with Epitaph's rootsy Anti label,
conjured up a similar sense of introverted perseverance with his
backing trio. Despite some technical glitches, new material such as
"Sometimes," along with such signature numbers as "The Maker,"
radiated a reflective spirituality more through haunting pedal-steel,
electric and acoustic guitar notes than Lanois' merely serviceable
voice.</TE>

<HD>Southwest Quickens Search for Partner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leaders of the cash-strapped Southwest Museum in Los Angeles, stalled
in partnership talks with the Pechanga Indians of Temecula and
looking for an ally, have set a mid-December deal-making deadline and
have invited other institutions to submit rival proposals.</LD>
<LD>   Duane King, executive director of the Southwest Museum, said the
idea is to clarify the institution's direction and calm supporters
who have voiced anxiety over the museum's uncertain status. The
Southwest Museum, the oldest in Los Angeles County and renowned for
its extensive collection of Native American artifacts, remains open
in Mount Washington, but has struggled in recent years with tight
finances and dwindling attendance, and has been looking for a
wealthier partner with compatible ambitions.</LD>
<LD>   "This is something we need to decide and get on with," King said.
The delay, he added, "has affected funding support," prompting
questions from foundations and individuals that traditionally donate
to the museum. King noted that to keep the museum's operating budget
steady at about $1.6 million annually, trustees in recent years have
dipped into unrestricted portions of the institution's modest
endowment, now just under $4 million.</LD>
<TE>   In inviting proposals from other prospective partners, the museum
trustees noted they've looked at various alliance ideas over the
years. In 1986, Southwest leaders considered a partnership with the
Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History that would have merged
their collections and created a new facility in the San Fernando
Valley. In 2000, the Southwest flirted with the Autry Museum of
Western Heritage, which proposed creation of a National Center for
Western Heritage that would include both institutions.</TE>
<TE>   For the last year, however, most of the institution's attentions
have been focused on the Pechanga Reservation in Riverside County,
where leaders have been considering a plan to invest casino revenues
in construction of a museum and cultural center.</TE>
<TE>   On May 17, the Southwest trustees agreed to a deal that would give
the museum up to $1.3 million in cash yearly, while giving the
Pechangas the opportunity to display artifacts from the Southwest
collection, 98% of which is out of public view. But on May 19, the
Pechanga general council delayed a scheduled vote on the pact when
tribal members said they wanted more information.</TE>
<TE>   Talks with the Pechangas have continued, King said, but the
invitation is intended to make sure the Southwest Museum isn't
overlooking any other opportunities. At the Pechanga Reservation,
spokesman and Tribal Council member Butch Murphy called the museum's
move an "understandable" step that shows "they must be getting to a
crunch period." Murphy said he does expect the partnership proposal
to come up again for a vote probably before December, but said he
couldn't predict which way the tribe's roughly 850 voting members
would lean.</TE>
<TE>   Other institutions that have talked with the Southwest in the past
were similarly circumspect. "The Autry Museum hopes the very best for
the Southwest Museum's collection," said Autry director John Gray,
adding that he will look at the museum's request for proposals.</TE>
<TE>   John Heyning, deputy director of research and collections at the
Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, said, "We would
certainly explore [a partnership], but there are a lot of factors
that make these strategic partnerships work or not work."</TE>

<HD>A Mystery Unfolds in 'His Secret Life'</HD>
<DH>Director Ferzan Ozpetek explores the ambiguities of sexual
orientation in graceful story about a wife's search for truth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Turkish filmmaker Ferzan Ozpetek, long based in Italy, follows up his
beautiful, seductive debut feature "Steam: The Turkish Bath" with the
equally impressive "His Secret Life," another perceptive probe into
the complexities and ambiguities of sexual identity.</LD>
<LD>   Margherita Buy stars as Antonia, an attractive woman of perhaps
40. For 15 years she has been married to Massimo (Andrea Renzi), an
archetypal virile and dashing Latin lover type. She was stunned to
wind up with such a handsome husband and remains dazzled, content to
live in his shadow, having even given up medical school to marry him.
For his part, Massimo continues to be not only flirtatious and
charming toward her, but prospers as a successful businessman. The
couple live in a large modern home outside Rome.</LD>
<LD>   Antonia, who works in a medical lab, is so happy with Massimo that
she has long accepted that his clearly high-power career demands much
of his time. The absences may be numerous and frequent, but Massimo
knows just how to make Antonia glad to have him back when he returns.
Then one day, in a rush, he steps out into traffic and is instantly
killed by a passing car.</LD>
<TE>   The devastated Antonia withdraws deeply into herself. She cannot
know she is about to embark upon a wholly unexpected journey of
self-discovery. Among the belongings Antonia in time collects from
Massimo's office is a painting with a loving message on its back
signed by an unfamiliar name. She concludes that it must be a gift
from a secret mistress of her late husband and feels a need to track
her down, fearing that maybe she didn't really know the man she loved
as well as she thought she did.</TE>
<TE>   Her detective work takes her to a huge old apartment house in the
picturesque Ostiense district in the heart of Rome. There Antonia is
met coldly by Michele (Stefano Accorsi); she insists on meeting his
sister, certain that she has been Massimo's mistress. Antonia's
beautiful, elegant and far more worldly mother, Veronica (Erica
Blanc), has already told her daughter that she's never been very
observant, and it's true. Despite the fact that Michele's home is a
gathering place for gays and lesbians, it just doesn't sink in with
Antonia that there is no sister, that he has been Massimo's lover for
seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Buy is an accomplished actress, and this is a big, juicy role.
What gives "His Secret Life" such a sharp edge above all is that we
see through Antonia's eyes as she discovers what gay life is
about--the eyes of a woman whose only contact with gay men is when
she tests them for HIV. Ozpetek is too skillful a filmmaker to lapse
into making a bald statement about gay society and instead reveals
what Michele and his life are like as a prelude to what happens with
him and with Antonia as both begin to put their grief behind them.
This graceful and wise film moves to its denouement with subtlety
and, at its end, strikes a note that seems just right for all that
has gone before.</TE>

popcorn or Milk Duds during the screening of the wide-screen film
because you may get a bit queasy.</LD>
<LD>   The wide-screen process makes you feel like you're being pulled
into the picture--whether you're riding on a roller coaster or a
Ferris wheel or riding the rapids in a rubber raft or flying through
the majestic canyons in Utah.</LD>
<LD>   "This Is Cinerama" changed the face of how movies could be
presented when it premiered in 1952. For its 50th anniversary, "This
Is Cinerama" has been completely restored. It marks the first time a
Cinerama film has been shown in its true format on the Cinerama
Dome's curved screen, despite the fact that the theater was
constructed in 1963 for that specific purpose.</LD>
<TE>   What makes Cinerama different from such wide-screen formats as
Imax, says John Sittig, director of Cinerama Inc., is "not what you
see in front of you but what you see on the sides."</TE>
<TE>   "Imax, although it is razor-sharp and is really realistic, is
basically a square picture. It looks like you are just watching a
very big, brilliant, sharp movie. Whereas with Cinerama, you actually
get the feeling of riding the roller coaster or running the rapids."</TE>
<TE>   Cinerama uses a three-strip format that is screened on three 35-
millimeter projectors. The middle projector screens the center frame;
the right projector supplies the image on screen left; and the left
projector screens the image on screen right.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Waller, a special effects technician who worked at Paramount
Studios in Astoria, N.Y., created Cinerama.</TE>
<TE>   "During World War II," says Sittig, "he invented something called
the Waller Gunnery Trainer. They had a Cinerama-type screen, a big
curved screen, and he ran five pieces of 35-millimeter film projected
on the screen. They brought in soldiers to practice shooting down
enemy planes. They actually installed 70 of these around the
country."</TE>
<TE>   After the war, movies began to take a hit at the box office: A
little something called television was keeping people at home.
Something new and innovative had to bring audiences back to the
movies. So Waller adapted his gunnery trainer for features.</TE>
<TE>   "Cinerama was the first modern-day wide-screen process. It opened
a full year ahead of 'The Robe,' which was the first CinemaScope
picture," says Sittig.</TE>
<TE>   "This Is Cinerama," hosted by journalist and Timex spokesman
Lowell Thomas, was an instant hit when it opened at one theater in
New York in September 1952. In Los Angeles, it played 122 weeks at
the Warner Cinerama Theater at Hollywood and Cahuenga boulevards.</TE>
<TE>   As effective as Cinerama is, the one thing you'll notice is the
lines on the screen demarcating the three projectors.</TE>
<TE>   When two narrative features, "How the West Was Won" and "The
Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm" were made in the early 1960s,
directors of cinematography would try to camouflage the lines by
having trees and other objects situated where the lines were.</TE>
<TE>   Besides "This Is Cinerama" and the two narrative features, four
Cinerama travelogue features were made before the process was
abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   13 Miles of Film</TE>
<TE>   "At its height, Cinerama only had 290 theaters worldwide that
could show the picture," says Sittig. The process of taking the
three- strip negative and turning it into a single 35-millimeter for
general release was expensive, and the quality wasn't as sharp as a
regular 35-millimeter film," says Sittig.</TE>
<TE>   "A release print of Cinerama is about 13 miles of film, whereas a
release print on a two-hour 35-millimeter feature is about two miles,
so you can imagine the cost of filming something," says Sittig.</TE>
<TE>   "You could not do close-ups in Cinerama because you didn't want to
have somebody's face in more than one of the three images. And it was
extremely difficult to do any kind of process shots for special
effects."</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Theatres, which owns ArcLight Cinemas, bought Cinerama
Inc. in 1962. Sittig has been trying to get Pacific to restore "This
Is Cinerama" for several years.</TE>
<TE>   When Pacific launched the Arc- Light Cinema company a few years
ago, Sittig approached it again.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the mission statements of ArcLight was to give the public
the transformative powers of movies, and Cinerama certainly is the
definition of the transformative powers of the movies."</TE>
<TE>   Three vintage Cinerama projectors were found in storage backstage
at a Cinerama theater in Hawaii. Sittig sent them off to Dayton,
Ohio, to John Harvey, a former Cinerama projectionist who over the
years has collected Cinerama items and even has built an in-house
Cinerama screen. "He reworked the projectors and brought them back to
standards," Sittig says.</TE>
<TE>   It was a bit more difficult to bring the film up to standards. The
negative was in very bad shape. "Because they had made so few prints,
every print of 'This Is Cin- erama' was made off the original
negative, so there was a lot of wear and tear," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Crest National Labs ran hundreds of color tests on the negative,
adding color and taking it away. Crest also had to correct shrinkage
of the negative.</TE>
<TE>   Chase Productions restored the audio tracks. The original tracks
were unplayable, the restored soundtrack contains 15 of the 20 tracks
from the release prints.</TE>
<TE>   "This Is Cinerama" is scheduled to play one week at the Cinerama
Dome. Sometime in the future, the theater plans to screen the newly
restored "How the West Was Won" and then hold a Cinerama weekend each
month featuring the two films.</TE>
<TE>   Sittig would love to restore the four Cinerama travelogues,
especially the 1955 hit, "Cinerama Holiday."</TE>
<TE>   "We are a business, and that decision probably is not going to be
made until we see what the response is to 'This Is Cinerama.' If we
recoup, then there is no reason we can't do another one."</TE>

<HD>Sorrow and Coincidence in 'Alias Betty's' Paris</HD>
<DH>For a young mother, an unexpected tragedy causes her life
to collide with a collection of people with struggles of their own.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Alias Betty" is a fortuitous teaming of astute, experienced
filmmaker Claude Miller and a renowned mystery writer, Ruth Rendell.
The plot is a classic: A shocking incident has a domino effect,
disrupting, for better or worse, an ever-increasing circle of
intersecting lives.</LD>
<LD>   Events cascade with the speed of a roller coaster, tossed about
with shameless coincidence, as the inner lives of characters are
illuminated with wit and precision. "Alias Betty" ranges between the
tragic and comic, sometimes simultaneously.</LD>
<LD>   A suspense thriller with a sense of pleasurable unease, the film
also serves up a juicy slice of human nature, revealed especially
through three very different mothers, played superlatively by
Sandrine Kiberlain, Nicole Garcia and Mathilde Seigner.</LD>
<TE>   Kiberlain's Brigitte--an author who writes under the alias Betty
Fisher--is a single mother, back in France after three years in New
York that yielded a brief marriage to a struggling American
journalist, a young son (Arthur Setbon) and an autobiographical
bestseller. She has settled into a large residence in an upscale
Paris suburb only to have her long-estranged mother, Margot (Nicole
Garcia), arrive for an unwanted visit.</TE>
<TE>   Margot suffers from porphyria, the mental disease that afflicted
Britain's Mad King George. She swears she has it under control, but
Brigitte has doubts. Margot, in her mental condition, commits a wrong
that could turn out to be right.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, back in a seedy section of Paris, Seigner's earthy
Carole, caught up in men she meets as a bar waitress, is indifferent
toward her son (Alexis Chatrian). The boy is then kidnapped, throwing
suspicion unjustly on her African live-in boyfriend Francois (Luck
Mervil). Francois in turn notices Carole becoming drawn again to Alex
(Edouard Baer), a forger and con man.</TE>
<TE>   These characters and others collide, sometimes with disastrous and
darkly comic misapprehension, while Brigitte flowers as a loving
mother. Margot and Carole, from different generations and social
classes, provide contrasting negative examples of motherhood; the
older woman is self-absorbed in her precarious mental balance, the
younger in a pursuit of pleasure as an escape from poverty.</TE>
<TE>   "Alias Betty" is a confidently adroit thriller that captures a
comprehensive sense of life in an edgy, multicultural and
economically diverse Paris. The large cast couldn't be better, but
the film belongs to Kiberlain.</TE>
<TE>   *Unrated. Times guidelines: some violence, sex and language; too
intense for younger audiences.</TE>

<HD>Carefully, Carefully Playing for Creeps</HD>
<DH>The earnest 'Red Dragon' excels at unnerving viewers but
seems subdued, saving its energy solely for Hannibal the Cannibal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Just like old times," smirks Hannibal Lecter, the most malevolent
Cheshire cat the movies have ever known.</LD>
<LD>   Old times indeed.</LD>
<LD>   In a ritual that is becoming at least as reliable and likely more
profitable than the swallows returning to Capistrano, Hannibal the
Cannibal, the preeminent boogeyman of the modern era, is back on the
screen in "Red Dragon."</LD>
<TE>   This marks Dr. L's fourth appearance in a major motion picture in
16 years, as well as Anthony Hopkins' third crack at the part in a
dozen. "Red Dragon" may also mark some kind of land speed record for
Hollywood's returning to a book it's already successfully filmed:
this particular Thomas Harris novel was previously made by Michael
Mann as the 1986 "Manhunter" (with Brian Cox in the Lecter role).</TE>
<TE>   The nominal reason to revisit the novel that introduced the doctor
to his fan base was that a new film could be (and in fact is) more
faithful to the book's ending, a deficiency that Hollywood has rarely
thought to remedy before.</TE>
<TE>   The reality, clearly, was that a chance to have Hopkins take on a
character the readers of Entertainment Weekly called the most popular
movie villain ever was too lucrative an opportunity for anyone to
pass up.</TE>
<TE>   Not screenwriter Ted Tally, who won an Oscar for "The Silence of
the Lambs." Not commercially adroit young director Brett Ratner, who
has made not one but two "Rush Hour" movies and is on tap to do the
next "Superman." Not the kind of talented cast--Hopkins, Edward
Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Harvey Keitel, Emily Watson, Mary-Louise
Parker, Philip Seymour Hoffman--that a play by Shakespeare would be
flattered to attract.</TE>
<TE>   This rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of
business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness, for an
eagerness to create images you wish you hadn't seen, which, in this
day and age, is of course the point. "Red Dragon" is a better film
than "Hannibal" (that wouldn't be hard), but not in the class of "The
Silence of the Lambs" or the underappreciated "Manhunter" in terms of
sheer filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   What's lacking in "Red Dragon," not that anyone will much care, is
to be expected, given all that history.</TE>
<TE>   There's no freshness here, no sense of newness or discovery. In
its place, there's an earnest desire not to drop the ball, a
determination to risk as little as possible in keeping this golden
egg from cracking wide open.</TE>
<TE>   Because America loves Lecter, the film starts with an extended
prequel, not in the book, that shows us the great man in his more
anonymous days, when he could go to a concert and not have everyone
in the audience wonder which orchestra member he was planning to eat.
(It's the flautist, if you're curious.)</TE>
<TE>   Capturing Lecter in that prequel is FBI investigator Will Graham
(Norton), who is so scarred by the experience in more ways than one
that he leaves the bureau and devotes himself to repairing boat
engines and spending quality time with his wife, Molly (Parker), and
their young son.</TE>
<TE>   But then old boss Jack Crawford (Keitel) shows up with news of a
new maniac on the loose, the kind of twisted ritual slaughterer that
Graham, who has a gift for projecting himself into deviant minds, is
especially good at bringing to justice.</TE>
<TE>   Needing an expert opinion on the new killer, dubbed the Tooth
Fairy by tabloid reporter Freddy Lounds (Hoffman), Graham goes to the
horse's mouth, so to speak, visiting Lecter the caged lion behind the
walls of an institution for the criminally insane.</TE>
<TE>   In the Harris novel as well as in "Manhunter," the evildoer's
identity is not a secret from the audience, and we get to meet dour
Francis Dolarhyde (Fiennes, taking the role Tom Noonan made
memorable) and his attractive blind co-worker, Reba (Watson in place
of "Manhunter's" Joan Allen). Where "Red Dragon" departs from its
predecessor is in giving Dolarhyde a more extensive back story and
spending more time with the William Blake illustration that gives the
book its title.</TE>
<TE>   All of "Red Dragon's" performers are unobjectionable, but the work
seems more subdued and under wraps than you might expect, as if
everyone feared getting in the way of the scare moments and the
Hopkins theatrics that are the main attraction.</TE>
<TE>   The actor, who was an Oscar-winning revelation in "The Silence of
the Lambs," is still very much an eerie presence, but on this, the
third time out, his performance is getting unavoidably mannered and
familiar.</TE>
<TE>   In this context, it's especially tonic to revisit the excellent
performance Brian Cox gave in "Manhunter," to reexperience a Lecter
who could chill the blood years before he became America's dark
sweetheart, the man whose hate we love to experience.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for violence, grisly images, language, some nudity
and sexuality. Times guidelines: an NC-17 in a sane world.</TE>

<HD>CBS Scraps AFI Awards</HD>
<DH>Television* The American Film Institute's first best-of
event suffered from low ratings and celebrity no-shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every year, the American Film Institute hosts two popular televised
specials: the AFI Life Achievement Awards, honoring legends of film,
and another show that highlights various aspects of the 20th
century's greatest movies.</LD>
<LD>   But when the AFI, one of the most respected organizations in
Hollywood, moved aggressively into the pre-Oscar awards derby this
year with its best-of awards show on CBS, the result proved a flop
with viewers.</LD>
<LD>   Now, CBS has decided to scrap plans for a second telecast next
January. If there is a lesson from AFI's experience, it is that
awards shows have proliferated to the point that the public has
difficulty differentiating one from another, and if you plan to
broadcast an awards show, you better hope the winners show up.</LD>
<TE>   The Jan. 5 AFI Awards telecast, which honored the year's top
achievements in film and television with a swank dinner at the
Beverly Hills Hotel, ranked a dismal 72nd in the Nielsen ratings and
garnered a mere 5.5 million viewers. The show ranked behind competing
programming on the three other broadcast networks, ABC, NBC and Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Although a number of film and TV stars turned out for the stately
dinner, including Dustin Hoffman, Michelle Pfeiffer and Samuel L.
Jackson, as well as Halle Berry and Ron Howard, who would go on to
win Oscars for best actress and director, respectively, the AFI show
had an embarrassing number of no-show winners such as Denzel
Washington, Robert Altman, Gene Hackman, Jennifer Connelly and James
Gandolfini.</TE>
<TE>   "The AFI fell on their face because they couldn't deliver the
talent," said Joey Berlin, president of the 186-member Broadcast Film
Critics Assn., which will again hold its own Critics Choice Awards on
Jan. 16 with E! Entertainment televising the banquet the following
night.</TE>
<TE>   "The AFI is a fabulous organization, and they do wonderful work
with their '100 Greatest' specials and their honors for individual
achievement, but it seemed odd for them to go into the awards-winning
business," Berlin said.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to build on a solid foundation and grow from that," he
added, noting that this will be his group's third awards telecast but
eighth awards banquet.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos de Abreu, founder of the Hollywood Film Festival, which has
managed in six short years to attract significant stars and
filmmakers to his untelevised gala awards show at the Beverly Hilton
Hotel, said the AFI should have foregone TV until the awards built a
following.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was sad that what they did was so rushed that it
didn't happen," he said. "They should have matured it a little bit
but they wanted to raise money for the institute."</TE>
<TE>   AFI Chief Notes Hurdles</TE>
<TE>   Jean Picker Firstenberg, the AFI's director and CEO, conceded that
the show required a more solid footing before jumping into
television, but she remains proud of the effort. One of the biggest
hurdles the AFI faced, she said, was mounting the production so near
the Christmas holiday season, when many celebrities and filmmakers
are out of town.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to do this, but the timing was extremely difficult,"
Firstenberg said. "We announced [our nominees] on Dec. 17 and
everybody was leaving Dec. 21 for the holidays."</TE>
<TE>   She said the forum for announcing the 2002 winners will be a
luncheon on Jan. 16. Although it will not be televised, the event
will feature invited actors, directors and producers of the nominated
films and TV shows.</TE>
<TE>   As before, the AFI will select the 10 most outstanding movies and
TV shows of the year--announced in alphabetical order--and up to 10
"significant moments" from the calendar year that affected the world
of the moving image.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we feel very good about the goal" of the AFI Awards,
Firstenberg said Thursday. "We're just going to continue to evolve it
so that it has a really strong foundation and continues to build its
credibility."</TE>
<TE>   Tom O'Neil, author of "Movie Awards" and host of the show business
awards Web site GoldDerby.com, said the AFI's show was a noble effort
but failed because "it looked too much like a poor man's Golden
Globes."</TE>
<TE>   "It was a dull show," he said. "It was not staged with any classic
show-biz pizazz. It may be there is room in the prime-time schedule
[for more awards shows], if they are entertaining like the Grammys or
the MTV Video Music Awards. A lot of these shows know how to put on a
show and be lively. To have one more show full of serious acceptance
speeches is dull."</TE>
<TE>   Crowded Awards Season</TE>
<TE>   O'Neil noted that between November and April each year, there is
at least one awards show a week in prime time. "It's possible the
viewers are saying enough is enough. People finally said about this
new one, 'We don't care.' "</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the AFI Awards telecast may have boosted Denzel
Washington's Oscar chances. He went on to win the best actor Academy
Award for his role as a corrupt cop in "Training Day."</TE>
<TE>   Washington lost to Russell Crowe, the star of "A Beautiful Mind,"
at this year's Golden Globes and at the Screen Actors Guild Awards.
The only time he was honored on national TV, O'Neil noted, was at the
AFI Awards. "Denzel had a lot of other strikes against him,
too--including playing a villainous role, the kind you never win
Oscars for. But he pulled it off. How? Surely, that early push from
the AFI helped--it was the stamp of legitimacy he needed."</TE>
<TE>   CBS spokesman Chris Ender said Thursday that the network is not
looking to find another awards show at this time. "We are very happy
with our current crop, which includes the Grammys, the People's
Choice Awards, the Country Music Assn. Awards and the Academy of
Country Music Awards."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "We've had a great relationship with the AFI and still
plan on doing our summer movie countdown specials with them."</TE>

<HD>Diversity in Programming Is Maintained, FCC Study Finds</HD>
<DH>Playlists for stations in the same genres are compared in
one report, but critics say it looked only at popular-format
stations. Ad costs jump.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Viewing it as the apocalypse for the radio industry, critics have
long said the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and its subsequent
whirlwind of ownership mergers have doomed the airwaves to bland,
repetitive playlists churned out at corporate headquarters. But a
series of studies released this week by the Federal Communications
Commission seems to buck that conventional wisdom, and contend that
little coming out of the speakers has changed since 1996.</LD>
<LD>   The FCC commissioned a dozen reports on media ownership, as part
of a biennial process to overhaul its rules regarding mergers,
consolidation and companies that own combinations of print and
broadcast outlets. Among them was a look at the relationship between
ownership concentration and diversity on the airwaves, by a trio of
researchers from the FCC's Media Bureau. They examined radio-station
playlists as reported by the trade magazine Radio &amp; Records, in what
the authors said "represents the first attempt to measure diversity
in radio markets using actual songs."</LD>
<LD>   They found that diversity on the radio, as measured by the numbers
of times songs were repeated between stations of the same format,
stayed about the same from 1996 to 2001, on average. Overall,
stations nationwide duplicated 7.4% of their songs in 1996, compared
to 6.8% in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   And for stations of the same format within the same listening
area, song diversity increased an average of more than 11% in the six
years.</TE>
<TE>   But the study looked at only the top 10 songs at each station, and
didn't examine how many of the rest of the songs were identical from
station to station. Also, when looking at the formats separately,
song diversity actually dropped in nine of the 12 categories the FCC
examined. For example, adult contemporary outlets duplicated songs
35% of the time in 1996, and did so 45% of the time in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not at all sure their study addresses the real issue--what
variety of music is played over time," said Christopher H. Sterling,
professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University
in Washington, D.C. "Critics say what is played is far more
conservative now, with much less variance over time, and a far higher
incidence of advertising," which, he noted, wasn't addressed.</TE>
<TE>   "The argument about narrower format choice is not resolved by this
study, which looks at only a portion of the popular-format stations,"
he added. "The sample is 300 stations out of more than 12,000 on the
air."</TE>
<TE>   In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress relaxed the rules
regarding ownership, saying that a single owner could have up to
eight stations in a large market, such as Los Angeles, and eliminated
the nationwide cap on station ownership. It used to be a single
company couldn't have more than 20 AM and 20 FM stations; now the
largest, Clear Channel Communications, owns nearly 1,200, including
the maximum eight in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "We speculate that concentration may be partly responsible for
more uniformity for stations within formats and more diversity
between formats," said the authors of the FCC's diversity report,
George Williams, Keith Brown and Peter Alexander. They added that
changes in diversity might also stem from outside factors that affect
all stations simultaneously. "Further, changes in ownership among
stations within a format have led to increases in playlist diversity.
Our results at this time suggest that recent consolidation has played
very little role in playlist diversity."</TE>
<TE>   Consolidation defenders say that having fewer owners can actually
increase programming diversity, because a single owner of several
stations who wants to maximize his or her audience would offer as
many formats as possible, to cover every possible taste. On the other
hand, they say, multiple owners in the same market would each vie for
the biggest share of the audience, and all try to compete for the
same, large slice of the pie, resulting in several Top 40 stations,
for example.</TE>
<TE>   But such reasoning doesn't translate to the real-world
marketplace, said Andrew Schwartzman, president and chief executive
of the Media Access Project, a Washington-based public-interest
telecommunications law firm.</TE>
<TE>   "They seek to maximize revenue by identifying and serving
demographically attractive audiences. They slice and dice existing
formats, and they tend to drop classical, because the audience is too
old," he said, and ethnic and children's programming, because the
audiences don't have enough income.</TE>
<TE>   "They say, 'We have an incentive to go serve people.' They have an
incentive to go serve who their advertisers want to reach,"
Schwartzman said.</TE>
<TE>   Other researchers say that diversity increases with competition,
because different owners who air the same programming would then be
forced to compete on advertising prices, so instead they set
themselves apart by what they play.</TE>
<TE>   Advertisers also are wary of ownership consolidation, saying that
a single owner who dominates a market can raise advertising rates
appreciably.</TE>
<TE>   One FCC report seems to justify their fears, showing that in 1996,
the largest owner in a given market averaged 36% of the advertising
revenue for the entire area, while in 2002 the largest owner takes in
47% of that money.</TE>
<TE>   But another of the 12 FCC studies released this week shows that,
even though advertising rates have jumped 68% from 1996 to 2001, the
agency attributes only 3% to 4% of that rise to consolidation, with
the rest coming from economic factors.</TE>
<TE>   With the publishing of the reports--available on the FCC Web site
(www.fcc.gov)--the agency now will take comments from broadcasters,
the general public and any other interested parties until Dec. 2, and
use those in crafting the final regulations on media ownership.</TE>

<HD>In the Tiniest Gestures, Delicacy on an Epic Scale</HD>
<DH>A richly colorful mural by Sandeep Mukherjee delineates
forms with pinpricks in vellum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stunning centerpiece of Sandeep Mukherjee's second solo
exhibition at Margo Leavin Gallery is a narrow, horizontal mural
that, when all is said and done, wraps around four walls to a length
of more than 110 feet. It's a gently epic narrative of sensual
pleasure and extrasensory wonder.</LD>
<LD>   The mural is drawn on translucent plastic vellum, painted on the
back with rich, flat colors. It reads from left to right. Deep rose
slides into pink, whose temperature slowly rises before slipping into
orange and, finally, yellow.</LD>
<LD>   The saga begins with delicate clusters of bobbing heads, their
linear contours made with pricks of a needle in the vellum. The
heads--self-portraits--stare, smile and make exaggerated gestures
with their mouths, as if attempting to speak. The poetic tension
between the vibrant skin of colored vellum and the empty space of the
pinpricks that delineate bodies makes them preternatural.</LD>
<TE>   When the mural reaches the first corner, it explodes into a
wide-eyed head, drawn in red pencil, which is surrounded by a radiant
aura made by scoring and folding the vellum. Ambient light becomes a
dramatic player, as palpable as graphite and paper. For several feet,
the mural is nothing more than folded colors in starburst patterns,
which are oddly exciting to examine. It's as if you've had a sudden
revelation of the extreme beauty that a sheer surface can contain.</TE>
<TE>   As Mukherjee's mural unfolds, small, faintly drawn, exquisitely
precise naked bodies suddenly tumble into view. Round another corner
and the bodies get larger, wrapped in pinpricked ribbons of colored
light. Eventually they grow to life-size, while the ribbons are
replaced by showers of stylized stars or flowers. Like a dream of
flying, the imagery has erotic overtones, which are enhanced by the
equivalence Mukherjee asserts between subject matter and art as skin.</TE>
<TE>   At the end, the tumbling bodies disappear and the star flowers
peter out. The wide-eyed, grinning portrait heads return, this time
lined up in a playful loop-the-loop. Visually, Mukherjee sets a
viewer gently back down on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   A suite of four slightly larger-than-life drawings in another room
uses the same marvelous techniques to show a standing figure (the
artist) embracing an ephemeral shaft of light or falling leaves.
Finally, an independent drawing is made from hundreds of horizontal
lozenge shapes scored into the minty green vellum to create a surface
as palpable yet permeable as water.</TE>
<TE>   This last work recalls the perceptually mysterious visual
conundrums of Vija Celmins, although by wholly different means.
Mukherjee has found a unique process for tapping into a resonant
tradition of Light and Space art.</TE>

<TE>   A Painstaking Exploration</TE>
<TE>   of Cinematic Space</TE>
<TE>   "Empire," the new film by Paul Sietsema being shown at Regen
Projects, takes its title from Andy Warhol's famous eight-hour movie
of the Empire State Building doing little more than being its big,
phallic, unmoving self. Like its predecessor, it's silent,
black-and-white and shot in 16-millimeter film. Yet its specific
inspiration was a whole different picture, also from 1964.</TE>
<TE>   This one appeared in Vogue. The photograph showed the Manhattan
living room of art critic Clement Greenberg, whose ideas on art were
the antithesis of everything Warholian. Sietsema made a painstakingly
precise, dollhouse-sized model of the room, furnished with vaguely
modern and French provincial furniture and adorned with Color Field
paintings by Kenneth Noland, Barnett Newman and other artists
Greenberg championed. The miniature set is the star of the fourth of
his captivating movie's six scenes.</TE>
<TE>   "Empire," like very different recent films by Steve Prina and
Jennifer Bornstein, luxuriates in the sensuous qualities of film,
which are so different from the sleek, crisp look of video that is
ubiquitous today. Sietsema plays with exposures, ragged film leader,
focus, lighting and duration.</TE>
<TE>   His 24-minute film is partly an exploration of cinematic space,
which is to television what Old Master painting is to video art.</TE>
<TE>   Sietsema's camera examines a grasshopper on a twig; the inner and
outer twists and turns of an organic sculpture, apparently made of
rough plaster (a segment slightly too long in duration); a linear
hanging construction; Greenberg's living room; a spinning crystal
that appears almost digital; and a Rococo room. From the grasshopper
that emerges from darkness at the start to the ornate interior that
provides a grand finale, all the filmed objects were props fabricated
by the artist.</TE>
<TE>   Nature and culture, the organic and dynamic, the actual and
illusionistic, the modern and the ancien regime--oppositions unravel
under the camera's caressing lens. A surrogate for your eye, it's the
dramatic actor performing in these stage sets.</TE>
<TE>   "Empire" employs an almost Minimalist structure in the Greenberg
sequence. A series of static shots pulls back from the stripe on the
Newman painting on the back wall. The series repeats. The third time,
the camera has been turned upside-down. The fourth shot scans the
room in a sequence of stills.</TE>
<TE>   And so it continues, articulating the space through a matrix of
still photographs--which, of course, is how a movie's illusion of
movement is made. The technique resonates bizarrely against
Greenberg's own claim that the best art banishes illusionism by
articulating the unique properties of its medium. "Empire" isn't
likely what he had in mind, which is one reason Sietsema's
labor-intensive film is so captivating.</TE>

<TE>   The Natural World in</TE>
<TE>   a Grain, or Cone, of Sand</TE>
<TE>   It's odd to encounter a solo gallery debut by an artist who has
been exhibiting for 35 years. But such is the case with the 12
digital prints and an installation by Connie Zehr now at Newspace.
This is the first commercial gallery exhibition for an artist who has
shown in museums and university galleries since 1967.</TE>
<TE>   Zehr is known for large, even room-sized installations of shaped
sand, where the environment is like a microscopic moment in time
that's been stopped in its tracks for your contemplation. Childhood
play, desert isolation, the actual fragility of terra firma and other
allusions flood the otherwise seemingly empty space.</TE>
<TE>   "Blue Cut Episodes," the new installation here, follows in that
lineage while also introducing gallery-goers to Zehr's recent
interest in digital technology. A thin, 8-by-16-foot rectangle of
glittery black sand is the pedestal for three cones of sand. One is
small, black and shiny. The other two are off-white and brown, and
each of these in turn is a pedestal on which rests a disk of glass,
one slightly thicker than the other.</TE>
<TE>   On top of each disk is a fan-shaped digital transparency that has
been twisted into a cone, its image showing flames flickering on
sparkly sand. Dappled light filters through the transparency, on
through the glass (which is, of course, made from silica) and onto
the sand. The work is an artistic model of altered states of primal
being.</TE>
<TE>   The demonstration quality of a model is a limitation, though. More
successful are the digital prints, mounted on aluminum, where visual
experience is actualized.</TE>
<TE>   Zehr's prints show cones of sand arising from fields of sand, all
in subtle, rich colors--pale violet, tan, ochre, various greens,
black, gray and more. Like sand through the hourglass, they suggest
the passage of time, while the evocative form also recalls everything
from a volcano to a stupa.</TE>
<TE>   Pulled in close in an effort to determine the relative size of the
mound, you discover something unexpected: The tiny grains of sand
approximate visible digital pixels, with which the images are made.
Suddenly, Zehr's provocative meditations on the natural world expand
to encompass technology in a challenging and unanticipated way.</TE>

<TE>   Tracing a Wild Visual Ride Through Color</TE>
<TE>   The six new acrylic and enamel paintings by Houston artist Aaron
Parazette at Mark Moore Gallery are at once sophisticated and silly,
glamorous and cartoonish, intellectually challenging and just plain
fun. Encompassing such contradictory responses results in lively,
urbane pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Painted in flat, glossy, hard-edged colors, the body-sized
abstractions suggest movement through space far and near. Loops,
S-shapes and ampersands seem to trace a wild visual ride through a
background that emerges from wide, horizontal bands of earth- and
sky-toned color. Think Wile E. Coyote chasing Roadrunner across a
mesa: What you see isn't bodies, but speed in space.</TE>
<TE>   This feeling of spatial dynamism is remarkable, given the flat,
two-dimensional abstraction Parazette employs. Color and scale
combine to perform the visual magic, aided by a precise pinstripe
technique.</TE>
<TE>   The pinstripes don't follow expectations. Instead, a thin line of
shocking yellow or pinkish violet will trace a green, white or black
curve, and when it arrives at a horizontal band, suddenly turn off
and follow that. The result is a competing set of almost subliminal
shapes within the painting, shapes that demolish the eye's attempt to
read the surface as flat and stable. Stylish and deceptively simple
on first glance, Parazette's paintings are impressive.</TE>

<AU>DAVID C. NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With about 32.9 million Americans currently existing at or below the
poverty level, John Steinbeck's 1939 novel "The Grapes of Wrath"
remains enormously pertinent, particularly its theme of the human
spirit's endurance of social injustice.</LD>
<LD>   Such relevance informs Frank Galati's 1990 Tony-winning
Steppenwolf Theatre adaptation, the final production of West Coast
Ensemble's 20th anniversary season. Under Claudia Jaffee's inspired
direction, this account of the Joad family's Depression-era migration
from Oklahoma to California reveals exceptional comprehension from
everyone involved, demonstrating that ingenuity has no price tag.</LD>
<LD>   Maintaining a pace as poetic as Steinbeck's prose is stark, Jaffee
illuminates Galati's compressed narrative with quiet imagination.
Merely the depiction of the actual truck-borne journey is but one
incisive image among many.</LD>
<TE>   Jaffee receives evocative assistance from Evan A. Bartoletti's
minimalist set, Diana Eden's costumes, David Mark Peterson's sound,
Lisa D. Katz's lighting, Scott A. Vandrick's choreography and Don
Cummings' musical supervision.</TE>
<TE>   The crowning achievement, though, is the casting, which prizes
essential quality over specific type. Robert Gantzos' Tom initially
seems too handsome--until he speaks, and Steinbeck's haunted
protagonist appears fully formed. Crystal Jackson's nontraditional Ma
has equal heartbreaking power, a Dust Bowl Mother Courage.</TE>
<TE>   They center the largest ensemble that the tiny venue has ever
accommodated, and only my own space limitations prohibit citing each
performer individually. Despite the odd erratic accent or misfired
beat, their superb contribution is the paramount element elevating
this deeply moving presentation to the status of company watershed.</TE>
<TE>   "The Grapes of Wrath," West Coast Ensemble, 522 N. La Brea Ave.,

Victorian mansion--a striking array of turrets, balconies and gables
that astounded his genteel neighbors when it was completed in 1874.</LD>
<LD>   While the new $15.5-million rectangular center doesn't scream
trophy, it's no less imaginative. It will dwarf Twain's manor in
terms of square footage, yet remain largely concealed in a
surrounding hillside, tucked into the terrain like a drawer into a
bureau.</LD>
<TE>   Part optical illusion, part hidden tunnel, architect Robert A.M.
Stern's creation has been under construction for about two months and
passersby would hardly know it.</TE>
<TE>   "This has worked out even better than I thought," John V. Boyer,
executive director of the Twain House, said one recent day as
bulldozers sculpted the Twain House's Nook Farm grounds just west of
downtown. "The architects cracked the code."</TE>
<TE>   The riddle centered on how to squeeze so much new building--three
times the square footage of the house--into half the space without
overwhelming the neighborhood, the Twain House and Harriet Beecher
Stowe's quiet Victorian cottage across the yard. The solution was to
go down.</TE>
<TE>   From the existing parking lot, a visitor will climb a short
stairway and enter the center by literally walking into the middle of
the hillside. The subterranean access helps reduce the building's
height, while natural light streaming in from above should keep away
any cold, underground feel.</TE>
<TE>   "It took a long time to come up with a solution," said Kevin
Smith, project manager for the architects. "It's an unusual design
problem solved in an elegant way. Because it's so big, it can't
exactly disappear. But it's kept very much in balance."</TE>
<TE>   More than just new space and architectural oddity, the tentatively
named Education and Visitor Center also is expected to revitalize the
experience of the Twain House, to boost its stature and prestige
beyond that of "popular house museum" into the realm of true national
monument.</TE>
<TE>   The effort puts the Twain House at the forefront of a national
trend toward energizing such homes with educational components.
Thomas Jefferson's Monticello plantation in Virginia this year opened
a 16,000-square-foot library. George Washington's Mount Vernon estate
just announced a new $85-million orientation center complex,
scheduled to open in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the new building to function as a machine for learning,"
Boyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Besides scale, the new Twain center presents other challenges to
Stern, one of the country's foremost architects and dean of the
School of Architecture at Yale University. The Twain house's board of
directors wants a center that's modern enough to dazzle but quiet
enough to complement the 19-room, Tiffany-decorated mansion.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, the sunken visitors' center also will feature things
such as "molded" bricks--with irregular, 19th century qualities such
as soft edges and varying sizes--and a slate roof instead of asphalt.</TE>
<TE>   After passing through the underground reception area, visitors
will proceed to the new center's Great Hall and discover Twain
quotations carved into stone walls under a mass of windows and
skylights a story above.</TE>
<TE>   A changing exhibition gallery will present shows on painters,
sculptors and others from America's Gilded Age. Educational exhibits
will explore period issues such as book-burning, race tolerance and
America's growing presence in the world.</TE>
<TE>   There will be a seminar room-library for scholars, teachers and
students; and a small theater showing a documentary that filmmaker
Ken Burns prepared for the Twain House. In addition, two high-tech
classrooms, linked by video to similar venues across the country,
will allow people to participate in long-distance Twain "town
meetings."</TE>
<TE>   All of these amenities are expected to educate while subtly
nudging the visitor upward to the Twain house grounds--serving as a
kind of "architectural promenade," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   "As you're making the ascent, the building allows the museum to
tell a story and really prepare the visitor for the historical
context of the house," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Nook Farm site charmed Twain with its then-open
countryside and bending Park River branch, the soft clay soil that
remains has complicated construction, said Mark Herari, a vice
president of Bovis Lend Lease, the construction manager for the
project. The excavation pit had to be dug at a 45-degree angle,
instead of 90 degrees, to help mitigate the problem and keep costs
down.</TE>
<TE>   The center is being designed and constructed under "green
architecture" guidelines that could make it one of the first museums
nationally to win certification from the U.S. Green Building Council,
an association of architects, builders and others working to foster
"environmentally responsible" buildings. For instance, the Twain
center's climate-control system will cool water by sending it nearly
500 feet into the ground instead of relying on energy-inefficient
cooling towers. "Swiss watchmaking is probably a very good metaphor,"
said Herari, whose company has handled restoration and expansion
projects at the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. "This is a small
and very complicated building."</TE>
<TE>   The Twain House is three years and $19 million into a major
fund-raising campaign with an overall goal of $30 million.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes according to plan, the Twain House by this time next
year should boast a new neighbor worthy of the man himself.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Playwright Oliver Mayer straddles the gap between expressionism and
sentimentality in "Ragged Time," his world-premiere play at the Black
Dahlia Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   The stretch results in a bruising tumble for Mayer, perhaps best
known for "Blade to the Heat," a drama loosely based on a famous and
deadly boxing match. Although "Blade" took a critical drubbing in
certain quarters for its hyperbole and shaky structure, it was lauded
as a directorial tour de force for George C. Wolfe, who helmed the
New York production, and for the late Ron Link, whose 1995 staging at
the Mark Taper Forum was widely acclaimed.</LD>
<LD>   If Matt Shakman, who has shown his directorial mettle in past
Black Dahlia productions, including the long-running "Orson's
Shadow," hopes to pull off a similar feat in "Ragged Time," he
largely succeeds. Shakman's exuberant staging plumbs the shallows of
Mayer's ragged "Time" to consistently entertaining effect. However,
that adage about the silk purse comes inexorably to mind.</LD>
<TE>   The action is set in 1898, in "A Deep South of the Mind" (why
Mayer doesn't cop to the fact that his setting is actually
Charleston, S.C., remains anyone's guess). The story concerns the
battle between Blind Ross and Blind Gary (Jeris Lee Poindexter and L.
Kenneth Richardson, respectively), itinerant black blues musicians
who are vying for the services of a Mexican orphan (Tina Sanchez) to
act as their "lead boy," a sort of seeing-eye human. The fact that
Ignacio is a talented musician who could pass along their musical
legacy makes their rivalry all the more bitter. Meanwhile, Abe (Tony
Abatemarco), a scrappy Jewish paperboy just passing through on his
way to war in Cuba, falls in love with Freda (Chane't Johnson), a
whore of color trying to pass for white. A requisite redneck (George
Gerdes) adds trumped-up menace, while the Yellow Kid (Steven Klein)
and the Buster Brownish Sanctimonious Kid (Jennifer Morrison),
comic-book characters come to life, also prance through the action to
arcane effect.</TE>
<TE>   Led by the authoritative Abatemarco, a top-notch cast shores up
the thematically shaky proceedings, but their praiseworthy efforts
cannot conceal the crumbling surface beneath.</TE>

<TE>   'Death Row' Takes</TE>
<TE>   Hard-to-Follow Path</TE>
<TE>   Like many others during the Depression, they were just trying to
hitch a free train ride. They paid dearly for it.</TE>
<TE>   After an on-board fight between a handful of black and white
youths, nine of the blacks, ages 13 to 19, were rounded up for
arrest. A pair of white women then emerged to claim that the black
youths had raped them. Guilt was swiftly declared and the death
penalty imposed. So began the legal odyssey that would forever lump
the youths together as the Scottsboro Boys.</TE>
<TE>   The Scottsboro case remains instructive on many levels. But
confusion threatens to overwhelm the lessons in "Direct From Death
Row: The Scottsboro Boys," written by Mark Stein, with songs by
Harley White Jr., at the Fountain Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   The show is presented vaudeville-style as it looks back at events
that began on March 25, 1931, near Scottsboro, Ala., and stretched
over the next 17 years. The Scottsboro Boys materialize on a scuffed
but gaily decorated stage (designed by Thomas A. Brown), looking
battered and wary. The longest-jailed--the cocky, resilient Haywood
Patterson (Edwin Morrow)--quickly emerges as the lead storyteller.
His compatriots are played by a mix of male and female actors who
assume multiple roles.</TE>
<TE>   To portray white accusers and defenders, the performers don
commedia dell'arte-style masks. One such figure is the youths' chief
accuser, Victoria Price (Bernadette L. Speakes), who sings a sexy
blues number and slinks around the stage even as she tries to present
herself as a paragon of Southern virtue. Coming to the defendants'
aid, Joe Brodsky (Gilbert Glenn Brown) of the American Communist
Party does a magic act to demonstrate what he can do for them.</TE>
<TE>   These moments lend a wry bit fun to what is otherwise a bleak tale
of racism and opportunism.</TE>
<TE>   Under Ben Bradley's direction, the proceedings are always
interesting to look at, and the characterizations--by a cast that
also includes Erinn Anova, Sheilagh M. Brooks, Yaphet Enge, Andre
Jackson, Don Richardson, Timothy Lopez Rogers and piano player Tim
Davis--are always sharp.</TE>
<TE>   But with so many characters trying to describe what happened,
sometimes out of sequence, the story is difficult to follow.</TE>

<TE>   Changing Mores on View</TE>
<TE>   in a Spanish Classic</TE>
<TE>   Along with his predecessor, Lope de Vega, 17th century Spanish
playwright Pedro Calderon de la Barca is widely considered a lion of
the golden age of Spanish drama. When he was ordained a priest later
in life, Calderon confined his output to sacramental plays, but not
before he had contributed some classic works to the theatrical canon.</TE>
<TE>   A dizzying blend of commedia and tragedy, "The Mayor of Zalamea"
(El Alcalde de Zalamea), is one such classic, now being performed in
Spanish and English on alternate weekends at the Bilingual Foundation
of the Arts. Director Margarita Galban, who also adapted the work
with Lina Montalvo, with English translation by Margarita Lamas,
starts off the production on an antic note, with plenty of live folk
music and comic buffoonery. Initially broad to a fault, the
production deepens and evolves as the plot segues into the serious.</TE>
<TE>   Upon entering the theater, the audience is greeted by street
vendors, who cheerfully ply their wares along the main street of
Estela Scarlata's village set. When a troop of soldiers, led by an
imperious Captain (Daniel Light), march into town, the villagers
scatter--with good reason. Battle-hardened louts, the soldiers are as
apt to pillage their own countrymen as they are the enemy. The
Captain, a Spanish noble who views commoners as less than human,
develops an obsessive yen for the beautiful Isabel (Veronica
Stocker), daughter of wealthy local farmer Pedro Crespo (Ernesto
Miyares), the town's most influential citizen and soon to become its
mayor. Isabel's subsequent rape and its aftermath are portrayed with
brutal veracity in Galban's flawed but passionate staging.</TE>
<TE>   Modern audiences may find it hard to accept Isabel's utter ruin
for her "crime," but her plight still stirs our sympathy and our
outrage, as does her father's valiant attempt to avenge her. A few
over-the-top performances could use some muting, but this is a rare
opportunity to see a venerable play that still has the power to
beguile us--both as drama and as a barometer of changing social
mores.</TE>

<TE>   Sleek 'Ivona' Proves More of a Curiosity</TE>
<TE>   Incongruous elegance clashes with textual excess in Witold
Gombrowicz's 1935 allegory "Ivona, Princess of Burgundia," opening
Cal Rep's 2002-03 season in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Generally revered in Poland, Gombrowicz was a bisexual iconoclast
with blood ties to Rabelais. His outsized anarchistic style has an
egalitarian attitude regarding class distinctions and institutional
hypocrisy.</TE>
<TE>   Gombrowicz's debut play, "Ivona" concerns a perversely bored
prince (Rory Cowan), who chooses a deformed commoner (Tannis Hanson)
as his bride. His parents (Craig Fleming and Lauren Thompson) and
courtiers think it a tasteless joke--the neurasthenic Ivona cannot
even curtsy.</TE>
<TE>   But when the populace hails the betrothal, the monarchs and their
amoral bishop (Marjorie Gaines) frantically regroup. Prince Philip's
cooling interest leads to multiple assassination plots, with Ivona
finally finished off by a fishbone.</TE>
<TE>   Danila Korogodsky's Cubist arena set takes Christopher Kittrell's
rich lighting beautifully. Vicki Lindstrom's Edwardian costumes are
lovely, and Barbara Matthews provides aerodynamic wigs worthy of
"Hairspray."</TE>
<TE>   Somehow this sleek staging makes a vice of restraint. Director
Adrian Giurgea harvests scant kinetic excitement or satiric
invention, repeatedly missing opportunities for direct address and
sexual ambiguity, and the pace is painful.</TE>
<TE>   The ensemble gallantly does what it can. Cowan's resonant voice
and presence are admirable, while Fleming and Thompson suggest
Ruritanian editions of George Coe and Angela Lansbury.</TE>
<TE>   Hanson, resembling a bald albino Cynthia Nixon, is elfin rather
than grotesque, perhaps Giurgea's most serious miscalculation.
Undoubtedly a curiosity, ultimately "Ivona" is less adventurous than
tedious.</TE>

<TE>   It's Difficult to Connect</TE>
<TE>   With This 'Six Degrees'</TE>
<TE>   When it first played Broadway a dozen or so years back, John
Guare's "Six Degrees of Separation" made enough of a splash that is
was subsequently made into a film starring Stockard Channing, from
the Broadway cast, and big-screen newcomer Will Smith. On the cusp of
the 1990s, Guare's arch drama about affluent New Yorkers duped by a
young African American con man struck a psychic chord with audiences,
who embraced the play's intellectual brittleness as somehow
emblematic of the times.</TE>
<TE>   Based on real events, the play will always hold a place in popular
culture, if only for popularizing the now celebrated concept that all
humans can be linked through six or fewer arbitrary pairings of
strangers--the basis for a popular parlor game and spirited
conjecture about just how many "degrees" separate Louise Brooks from,
say, Queen Latifah. But the acid test of time has not been kind to
Guare's cartoonish parable, which now holds our interest primarily as
a marginalized period piece, a fading portrait of '80s greed.</TE>
<TE>   Recent world events have possibly contributed to the play's
reduction from the profound to the trivial. Yet the current
production by the Company Rep at the El Portal's Circle Theatre is as
much the victim of Anthony J. Haney's tin-eared direction as it is of
historical retrospect. When the deceptively preppy Paul (Brandon Ford
Green) bursts into the high-rise luxury digs of Flan (Joe Garcia) and
Ouisa (Chera Holland), he is supposed to wow the white folks with his
deft chatter. But Paul's initial monologue seems more boring than
mesmerizing--a serious flaw. If Paul hopes to insinuate himself into
this alien social orbit, he must be a spellbinder from the
get-go--not the case in Green's tame turn.</TE>
<TE>   Under Haney's hand, the actors roll out wafer-thin portrayals,
precisely rendered but devoid of the subtexts that might have lent
weight to the piece.</TE>
<TE>   The sole exception is Holland, who takes full advantage of her
opportunities as one of the few sympathetic characters in Guare's
stable of stereotypes--a refreshing respite from the prevalent
emotional sterility.</TE>

<HD>Remake Is Heir to the 'Mother of All Miniseries'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Forsyte Saga" has come full circle. In 1969, PBS aired the
26-part BBC series based on a trilogy of novels by Nobel laureate
John Galsworthy. It told of the lives, loves, scandals and financial
acumen of a London family from the 1870s through the 1920s. Think of
it as a Victorian version of "The Sopranos" without the violence.</LD>
<LD>   The series was a huge success by PBS standards, although it lost
the Emmy for best dramatic series to "Marcus Welby, MD." In the next
several years, the black-and-white series was repeated numerous times
on PBS.</LD>
<LD>   "It is the mother of all miniseries," says Rebecca Eaton,
executive producer of PBS' "Masterpiece Theatre," which is presented
by WGBH in Boston.</LD>
<TE>   "It really gave birth to 'Masterpiece Theatre,' " she says. "WGBH
thought there was maybe more shows where that came from, and they
created a relationship with Mobil Corp. Then WGBH started looking
into the BBC archives."</TE>
<TE>   "Masterpiece Theatre" began on PBS in fall 1971 with "The First
Churchills," and now the venerable dramatic showcase kicks off its
32nd season Sunday night with a lavish new version of "The Forsyte
Saga." The eight-hour series begins with a two-hour premiere and then
unfolds in weekly one-hour episodes for the next six weeks. (On
Tuesday, Acorn Media releases the show on DVD and video.)</TE>
<TE>   The original series "was done in a very old-fashioned way," she
says. "It was over 30 years ago and the whole technology of
television and the sensibility of television dramas was so different.
I knew doing this again it would look completely different."</TE>
<TE>   The cast includes Damian Lewis ("Band of Brothers") in the key
role of Soames Forsyte, along with Rupert Graves, Corin Redgrave,
Gina McKee and Amanda Ooms.</TE>
<TE>   The actors, Lewis says, worked hard not to represent Soames and
Irene as the archetypal villain and victim, and to create "a greater
ambiguity in their relationship and their relationship with the
audience as well."</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is a testament to Galsworthy's writing that he is able
to create this character that no one likes but kind of feel sorry for
at the same time," Lewis says. "He's kind of an antihero."</TE>
<TE>   McKee sees Irene as a victim of her time. "She doesn't have a lot
of choices," the actress says. "When we first meet her, she's a
young, almost naive young woman; her naivete comes out of her lack of
life experience. She hasn't been educated in any practical sense.
She's been brought up to be a wife, to be a lady, to be beautiful and
to be non-challenging.</TE>
<TE>   When Soames won't let her leave the marriage, Irene says she feels
trapped, and she shuts down emotionally. "She's a possession, and her
spirit is crushed."</TE>
<TE>   "The Forsyte Saga" was a hit with audiences in England when it
premiered last spring. "The young have been the most avid audiences,"
producer Sita Williams says. "The story appeals to them."</TE>
<TE>   The cast is again in front of the cameras, making the sequel to
"The Forsyte Saga," based on Galsworthy's subsequent books in the
series, which "Masterpiece Theatre" will air.</TE>

<LD>He sees dead people. He also vacuums them up, traps them in jars and
pretty much irritates the heck out of them.</LD>
<LD>   In "The Scream Team," the Disney Channel's silly, scary new
Halloween movie (at 8 tonight), a motley bunch of ghosts meets its
match in young Ian Carlyle (Mark Rendall) and his sister Claire (Kat
Dennings), who attend their grandfather's funeral in haunted Steeple
Falls as the town gears up for its Zachariah Kull Halloween Festival,
named for a long-dead legendary arsonist.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Dad is cranky because Grandpa never showed him love and
attention; Ian's cranky because Dad thinks Grandpa's inventions are
junk; and Claire and Ian can't work together to help Grandpa's spirit
cross over without putting each other down in mundane TV-sibling
fashion.</LD>
<TE>   Claire's squeals of terror scrape nerves like nails on a
chalkboard, but fear is fleeting when the teens discover the cartoony
"soul removal center" in an old ruin of a house where the recently
dead are ushered into the afterlife. Unfortunately, things get
serious, too: Is Dad angry because he's carrying 'round a whole lot
of hurt from childhood? Did Grandpa give Dad the cold shoulder
because he didn't love him--or because he did? Sure, Zachariah is a
soul-eating ghoul now, but was he really a murderer or the victim of
a 200-year-old rush to judgment?</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Najimy as head usher for the dead and Eric Idle as her loony
aide have a few comic moments, but the potential for fun goes mostly
unrealized, diluted by an overdose of the teens' worldly cynicism and
a misguided attempt to add depth with trite armchair psychology.</TE>

<HD>Fund-Raiser Takes Flight With 'West Wing's' Help</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GINA PICCALO and LOUISE ROUG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inside producer Lawrence Bender's spacious living room, beyond the
candles surrounding the guest list and the stash of gift bags, a
crowd of young, energetic liberals mingled with Hollywood types. The
Wednesday night gathering was part fund-raiser, part viewing party
for the second episode of the Emmy-winning "The West Wing," which
aired on NBC at 9 p.m. Bender invited people to pay a minimum of $250
to watch it at his house. The casual affair in Bel-Air raised an
estimated $100,000 for the nonprofit Rock the Vote, which works to
build political awareness among young people and registers them to
vote.</LD>
<LD>   "The last time I was here, it was the [2000] Democratic
convention," noted Los Angeles City Council candidate Rob Vinson. "It
was like 'The West Wing' meets the West Wing. Half the Clinton
administration was here."</LD>
<LD>   On this night, the crowd was peppered with actors, including "The
West Wing's" Janel Moloney and Anna Deavere Smith, "Rock the Vote"
staff, as well as the group's founders and supporters. Before the
show, the crew from "Extra!" interviewed guests from a brightly
lighted spot on the lawn. Most guests crowded onto the back porch
near the bar, where bartenders doled out the POTUS (for President of
the United States), a drink with Dewar's White Label Scotch whiskey
and ginger ale.</LD>
<TE>   The evening also celebrated the nonprofit's inclusion in that
night's episode. In it, members of the cast, most prominently Allison
Janney, were featured at a fictitious Rock the Vote concert at the
House of Blues. The episode, which reached an estimated 20 million
people, was a coup for the organization that operates nationally with
a 10-member staff. "It's a call to arms for the last 34 days of the
election," said Rock the Vote Executive Director Jehmu Greene of the
party and the episode.</TE>
<TE>   But for "West Wing" creator and executive producer Aaron Sorkin,
watching about 150 people react to the show was near torture. During
the hourlong episode, he stood in the back of the room with his head
down, hand to his brow. At every commercial break, he rushed outside
to smoke a cigarette.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about watching people watch the show, he didn't
hesitate. "It's like being naked," he said, lighting another
cigarette. "It's like that dream you have when you find yourself in
front of a bunch of people--totally naked. It's like that every
time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Play It With Flowers</TE>
<TE>   During a rare midweek lull, florist Mark Held, whose Sherman Oaks
company, Mark's Garden, is routinely booked for celebrity weddings
(recently Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale) and high-profile Hollywood
affairs, details his latest job: a cascade of roses and orchids that
spills off the length of the stage for the Los Angeles Philharmonic's
season premiere tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "It has to be a little bigger than life," Held said by phone
Wednesday as he awaited shipments of roses from South America and
orchids from Hawaii. "It adds to the excitement."</TE>
<TE>   Two thousand Virginia and Message roses in butter and ivory, and
hundreds of white dendrobium orchids, attached to foam and heavy
chicken wire, blanket the foot of the stage at the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion in anticipation of this evening's show. But for all the
flowers' drama, there won't be a lofty aroma accompanying them. "It
bothers the performers," says Held. "Fragrance is something they want
to stay away from."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the backdrop should invigorate the sonic experience
of Esa-Pekka Salonen conducting Bartok's "Miraculous Mandarin" and
Orff's "Carmina Burana," as well as performances by vocal soloists
Harolyn Blackwell, Stanford Olsen, Rodney Gilfry, the Los Angeles
Master Chorale and Los Angeles Children's Chorus.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a bit of goodwill that comes with this job, says
Held. The enormous floral arrangement, which cost thousands of
dollars, is an annual gift from New York investment banker Bob White,
who moved from Los Angeles years ago but sustains his generosity.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Show's Marketing</TE>
<TE>   The cable network Showtime has launched a pioneering new
merchandising program that sells a variety of items from its
provocative gay-themed TV show, "Queer as Folk," targeting gay and
lesbian consumers. The show's Web site queer.sho.com offers "Queer as
Folk" Christmas cards, calendars and magnets, as well as irreverently
captioned T-shirts (most of which cannot be printed here) and frosted
tumblers prominently featuring the word "queer."</TE>

<LD>THE DEMON IN THE FREEZER</LD>
<LD>   A True Story</LD>
<LD>   by Richard Preston</LD>
<TE>   Random House</TE>
<TE>   256 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Richard Preston's unsettling "The Demon in the Freezer" is a book
timely in ways most of us would rather not think about.</TE>
<TE>   It is about terrorism with biological weapons. Mostly, it is about
the threat of smallpox as a weapon of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Preston obviously began work on the book before Sept. 11, 2001,
and before the terrorism by anthrax that followed the airplane
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But he added three chapters on the anthrax sent by mail to several
targets, among them Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle and NBC
anchorman Tom Brokaw. The anthrax-tainted letters killed five people
and made about a dozen ill.</TE>
<TE>   The case has not been solved. Preston, like others, believes the
sender was someone who worked in American anthrax laboratories and
used American-grown anthrax spores.</TE>
<TE>   Preston takes us to the laboratory at Ft. Detrick, Md., which is
the center for developing defenses against bioterrorism and assists
in countering bioterrorist attacks. This lab was the center of
Preston's previous nonfiction book, "The Hot Zone," about the Ebola
virus. The lab was a focus, along with the national Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and the FBI, of the effort
to trace the anthrax.</TE>
<TE>   The lab is also the center of an effort focused on the smallpox
vaccine, should it be employed as a weapon. After introducing the
reader to the lab, Preston shifts to his principal theme, smallpox as
a potential weapon.</TE>
<TE>   The disease was finally eradicated from nature in the 1970s after
a program that lasted several years and spanned the globe. Preston
believes all traces of it could have been destroyed in about 1980,
and should have been. But under pressure from some scientists, and
from the British Ministry of Defense and the Pentagon, he writes, the
American government decided to keep some samples for experimental
purposes, as did the then-Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   Under international agreements the virus is supposed to be kept,
frozen and in special containers cooled with liquid nitrogen, in only
two places in the world--at the CDC and at a location in Russia. But
Preston fears others may have it. He is especially afraid that
scientists recklessly working with the virus may produce a super
smallpox strain against which there may be no defense.</TE>
<TE>   He argues that smallpox is the most virulent disease humans ever
have known since it first jumped to the species from an unknown
animal between 3,000 and 10,000 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, the successful effort by a handful of doctors and their
helpers around the world to get rid of it in nature was without
parallel in human experience.</TE>
<TE>   "No greater deed," he writes, "was ever done in medicine, and no
better thing ever came from the human spirit." He says that the
disease was killing 2 million people a year in the years before its
eradication. Getting rid of it has already saved about 60 million
lives.</TE>
<TE>   These statements, which come at the end of "The Demon in the
Freezer," are the most assertive, the most charged with the author's
feelings, of any in the book. For Preston, a writer for the New
Yorker, is consummately a writer in the New Yorker
style--understated, rarely personal.</TE>
<TE>   Without comment, he tells his stories, letting them speak for
themselves through the people involved.</TE>
<TE>   He has an especially effective account of a smallpox outbreak in
Germany in 1970, during which the authorities stopped its spread by
using the "ring" method, isolating patients and vaccinating potential
victims in ever-widening circles until it could spread no more.</TE>
<TE>   His story of a German child dying in terrible pain in isolation
from her family speaks for itself of the horror of the disease. He
has his heroes, chief among them the American epidemiologist D.A.
Henderson, who led the eradication effort and opposed retention of
the virus for experimentation.</TE>
<TE>   Preston, however, too often muddles his story with irrelevant
detail. Yet when the reader chops through the stylistic underbrush
and makes trails connecting the main points that Preston declines to
connect himself, the picture becomes chillingly clear: Although
eradicated in the wild, smallpox is still a threat frozen in the
laboratories, and it is man who put it there and keeps it there.</TE>
<TE>   These are the last fateful words in "The Demon in the Freezer":
"We could eradicate smallpox from nature, but we could not uproot the
virus from the human heart."</TE>

<HD>Research That Advances ... Well, Nothing</HD>
<DH>Ig Nobel Prizes recognize the achievements of studies on
beer foam and bellybutton lint</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROY RIVENBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The real Nobel prizes hog most of the publicity, but their
smart-alecky cousin, the Ig Nobel awards, are way more fun.</LD>
<LD>   This year's honorees include:</LD>
<LD>   * A study of ostrich courtship behavior toward farmers.</LD>
<TE>   * An analysis of bellybutton lint.</TE>
<TE>   * A computerized device that translates dog barks into human
speech.</TE>
<TE>   * A scholarly article on "Scrotal Asymmetry in Man and in Ancient
Sculpture."</TE>
<TE>   The Ig Nobels, now in their 12th year, are sponsored by the Annals
of Improbable Research, a science humor magazine that covers
scientific achievements that "cannot or should not be reproduced."</TE>
<TE>   Winning is a dubious distinction.</TE>
<TE>   When Vicki Silvers heard about her prize, "I didn't know whether
to say thank you or that my feelings were hurt." She eventually
decided it "sounded like a lot of fun" and flew to Boston for
Thursday night's ceremony at Harvard University.</TE>
<TE>   Silvers, along with colleague David Kreiner from Central Missouri
State University, received the Ig Nobel Literature Prize for
discovering that students who buy used college textbooks don't score
as well on tests if the book's previous owner highlighted the wrong
passages. Even if the student tries to ignore the highlighting, it
has a detrimental effect, she says.</TE>
<TE>   Hmm. Sounds like a study financed by the college textbook
publishing industry. "Not at all," Silvers says. "I got the idea when
I was a junior in college, standing in line behind a guy who was
buying a used book. When he saw the highlighting, he said, 'Oh, cool,
dude. I'm just going to read the highlighted parts.' "</TE>
<TE>   Other Ig Nobel winners traveled from Japan, Australia, Britain,
Germany and Illinois for the award gala, which features real Nobel
laureates singing opera and handing out awards while boisterous
audience members throw paper airplanes onto the stage.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers from a Japanese toy company picked up the Ig Nobel
Peace Prize for inventing Bow-Lingual, a dog-to-human language
translation device. The team was recognized for "promoting peace and
harmony between the species." According to news reports, Bow-Lingual
uses voiceprint technology to analyze dog barks and translate them
into preprogrammed sentences representing six emotions--frustration,
happiness, sadness, alarm, desire and self-expression.</TE>
<TE>   The $100 gizmo, which fits on the dog's collar, debuted in Japan
last month and quickly sold out, says Marc Abrahams, the Ig Nobel's
master of ceremonies. An English version is expected by mid-2003.</TE>
<TE>   Four British scientists nabbed the biology prize for their study
of "Courtship Behavior of Ostriches Toward Humans Under Farming
Conditions in Britain." Sadly, England isn't the only nation menaced
by lovesick birds. In 1998, a 150-pound emu fixated on an Alabama
man, aggressively stalking him whenever he left the house. "He had to
carry a gun to take out the trash," said an animal-rescue official.
"He and his family were prisoners in their home."</TE>
<TE>   Abrahams says the ostrich study, which was honored Thursday by a
bumper sticker that read, "North American Man-Bird Love Assn.," is
considered groundbreaking in ostrich industry circles.</TE>
<TE>   The physics prize went to a University of Munich scientist who
showed that the Law of Exponential Decay can be used to predict how
long beer foam will last.</TE>
<TE>   This year's most bizarre entry was in the medical category. Chris
McManus, a psychology professor from University College London, took
top honors for a 1976 journal article analyzing the asymmetrical
positioning and size of gonads on antique nude statues in Italian
museums.</TE>
<TE>   After reviewing 107 sculptures, he concluded that ancient artists
correctly made the right testicle hang higher than the left, but they
incorrectly assumed the lower testicle was larger. In reality,
research shows that a man's right testicle is usually larger, he
says.</TE>
<TE>   What on earth inspired McManus to conduct such a study? It's a
question that could be asked of many Ig Nobelites. In this case, the
answer is a 1764 article on statue crotches that McManus stumbled
across in college. Later, while traveling through Italy, he decided
to test the accuracy of his predecessor's theory. "I got out my
notebook and started scribbling," he recalls. The results were
eventually published in the journal Nature.</TE>
<TE>   He readily acknowledges it's a twisted topic. "My original article
was only about 380 words," he says. "But whenever I try to describe
it to someone, it takes me about three times that long."</TE>
<TE>   Today, he remains fascinated by the differences between the left
and right sides of the human body and brain. But his research focuses
mostly above the belt. His new book, "Right Hand, Left Hand,"
discusses right- and left-handedness.</TE>
<TE>   Other 2002 Ig Nobel winners include a pair of scientists from
India who devised a formula for estimating the total surface area of
elephants, and a Spaniard who invented a washing machine for dogs and
cats.</TE>
<TE>   Not every winner decided to attend the ceremony. The Ig Nobel
Economics Prize went to the corporate executives and auditors of
Enron, Adelphia, Qwest Communications, Tyco and several other
corporations for "adapting the mathematical concept of imaginary
numbers for use in the business world."</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us to Karl Kruszelnicki, an Australian physicist and
radio host who conducted a comprehensive study on human bellybutton
lint. Interviewed by telephone after his arrival in Boston,
Kruszelnicki said his project began after a listener on his show
asked why bellybutton lint is usually blue.</TE>
<TE>   After combing the scientific literature and finding little
information, Kruszelnicki launched his own study, surveying 4,800
people. His conclusion: "You're more likely to have BBL if you're
male, hairy and have an innie bellybutton." As to why the lint is
usually blue, he explains that most clothing is blue or contains blue
dyes.</TE>
<TE>   He also reports that people who switch from a top-loading washing
machine to a front-loading model notice a "dramatic drop in the
production of BBL." He theorizes that the gentler washing mechanism
in front-loaders makes clothing fibers less likely to come loose and
migrate to the bellybutton.</TE>
<TE>   Not content to win one Ig Nobel, Kruszelnicki is already working
on his next potential prize. He's investigating claims that wood hit
by lightning is impossible to cut and won't burn. "We're collecting
wood from trees that have been struck by lightning to solve the
riddle," he says. "Will this benefit the human race? We don't know."</TE>

<LD>Matsuri</LD>
<LD>   Your head spins as costumed dancers whirl about. Bells ring. Gongs
sound. Drums beat.</LD>
<LD>   Welcome to matsuri, Japanese festivals known for their incredible
costumes, extravagant entertainment and sacred chants.</LD>
<TE>   Matsuri are holy day festivals during which children learn about
the Japanese deities, or gods. The bright colors and wild atmosphere
are supposed to surprise and delight the deities. Children learn how
to dance, sing and perform in order to please them.</TE>
<TE>   During matsuri, grown-ups wear holiday kimonos, and children often
wear Ha'pi coats--short jackets that are decorated with words or
symbols that tell the neighborhood in which the child lives.</TE>
<TE>   The child pictured here is called a Chigo boy. He rides a horse as
the mascot of the matsuri parade, and is thought to be so beautiful
and innocent that he represents purity for his community.</TE>
<TE>   You can see all kinds of festival clothes, banners, masks and more
at the UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History, and even make your own
festival chime. The exhibition "Matsuri! Japanese Festival Arts"
opens at noon Oct. 13 with a family festival that includes live
music, dance and theater performances, art workshops and
refreshments. The exhibition continues through Feb. 9. In celebration
of the museum's anniversary, admission is free. For more information,
call (310) 825-4361 or visit www.fmch.ucla.edu.</TE>

<HD>A Serious Shift in Readers' Interests</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of all the unexpected events since Sept. 11, one of the more
unexpected has been the resurgence of America's serious, general
interest magazines. Less than a decade ago, savvy media analysts
routinely questioned not only the relevance, but also the longevity
of the Atlantic Monthly, Harper's and the New Yorker. They were
dinosaurs, quaint artifacts of the unwired universe, of the dead
epoch that began with movable type and involved such plodding
occupations as reading.</LD>
<LD>   Today, circulation at all three publications is up and--more
important--under editors Michael Kelly and Cullen Murphy of the
Atlantic, Lewis Lapham of Harper's and David Remnick of the New
Yorker, the journalism, commentary and cultural criticism in all
three have taken on a renewed confidence, vigor and immediacy.</LD>
<TE>   None of this surprises the San Francisco-born Lapham, whose long
tenure at Harper's makes him the most senior of the group. He and his
colleagues, Lapham said in an interview this week, are responding to
a seismic shift in American culture that began Sept. 11, 2001. "Our
readers' appetites are fundamentally different now," he said. "When
everyone is feeling that the only important thing in life is the next
Lexus and worship CEOs as demigods, there is little appetite for
ideas or good writing, which is what our magazines are about. But the
fact remains that you can get more out of good writing than you can
from a 500-channel television universe that inevitably dissolves into
incoherence. Writing involves thought and creates coherence, which is
an appealing commodity in this atmosphere of concern.</TE>
<TE>   "When the trade towers went down and the economy went south,"
Lapham said, "people realized that their sense of entitlement to
security was an illusion and their presumed prosperity the product of
manipulation. In this atmosphere, intelligent writing becomes a
comfort. I think it is interesting that the new appetite for good
thinking and writing has been accompanied by a rising interest in
history. You can see that on the bestseller lists and, even, in the
History Channel's increased ratings."</TE>
<TE>   History is something that always is on Lapham's mind, and it
informs his other vocation as one of America's foremost essayists.
Since Sept. 11, he has devoted his monthly essay in Harper's to an
ongoing critical appraisal of the Bush administration's response to
events. Those pieces have been collected in a single volume, "Theater
of War" (The New Press; $22.95).</TE>
<TE>   As an essayist, Lapham is a leading practitioner of the style that
might be called American baroque--a school that includes Gore Vidal
and the late Murray Kempton: The syntax is formal, even ornate;
historical and cultural allusions are frequent and erudite; the
politics are both left-wing and populist; the undercurrent is irony
and the sensibility might be termed American high tory.</TE>
<TE>   Something of Lapham's flavor is captured in this passage from the
essay, "Res Publica:"</TE>
<TE>   "As was proved by events on the morning of Sept. 11, the
laissez-faire theories of government do us an injustice. They don't
speak to the best of our character; neither do they express the
cherished ideal embodied in the history of a courageous people. What
joins the Americans one to another is not a common nationality, race
or ancestry but their voluntary pledge to a shared work of both the
moral and political imagination. My love of country follows from my
love of its freedoms, not from pride in its armies or its fleets, and
I admire the institutions of American government as useful and
well-made tools (on the order of a plow, an ax, or a surveyor's plumb
line) meant to support the liberties of the people, not the ambitions
of the state. The Constitution serves as the premise for a narrative
rather than as the design for a monument or a plan for an invasion.</TE>
<TE>   "Any argument about the direction of the American future becomes
an argument between the past and the present tense. Let us hope that
it proves to be both angry and fierce.... "</TE>
<TE>   The impediment to such an argument, in Lapham's view, is
Americans' historic reluctance "to avail themselves of free
expression. De Tocqueville took note of our extreme aversion to
saying anything that will make people squirm. We are a fair-minded
people, but unwilling to give offense. It's not really timidity, but
a kind of politeness."</TE>
<TE>   Lapham feels no such inhibition when it comes to the Bush
administration whose "policy on these defining questions, is
incoherent, filled with contradictions. I think Californians have
been quicker to pick up on that than people in other parts of the
country. When it comes to Iraq, for example, they are inclined to ask
such impermissible questions as, 'What has Saddam Hussein actually
done to us?'</TE>
<TE>   "Harper's largest circulation is in California," Lapham said, "but
from our inception in the 1850s, ours has been a magazine aimed at
the country as a whole. Most of our 11 editors have come from the
West. As a result, the bias implicit in our magazine for 150 years
has been, 'What are those scoundrels up to in Washington and New
York?' There is, in particular, an entirely proper suspicion of the
government in Washington, which I--for one--can only hope will
spread."</TE>
<TE>   L.A.'s Shrinking Alternative Press</TE>
<TE>   Born of the of the 1960s' protest politics, America's alternative
press is increasingly a youth-oriented appendage of the entertainment
media with a lucrative foot in the sex trade's advertising. Across
the country, alternative weeklies essentially have been concentrated
into two chains:</TE>
<TE>   New York-based Village Voice Media surrounds its lifestyle and
entertainment reporting with a thinning veneer of earnestly reported
progressive journalism focused mainly on local politics, civil
rights, feminism and the labor movement.</TE>
<TE>   The larger chain, Phoenix-based New Times, wraps its entertainment
coverage in a kind of mouthy contrarian journalism with an infusion
of populist and libertarian attitudes and occasional investigations.</TE>
<TE>   But, month by month, the news focus of most publications in both
chains takes on a softer and softer hue.</TE>
<TE>   So, now that Village Voice Media's LA Weekly has cornered Southern
California's alternative press niche by paying New Times to close its
Los Angeles paper, what does the chain's management intend?</TE>
<TE>   "First of all," said Voice Chief Executive David Schneiderman,
"we'll be trying to absorb as many of New Times' advertising dollars
as we can get." In fact, by late morning Wednesday--the day New Times
Los Angeles closed down--telephone calls to the shuttered papers'
advertising number were being automatically forwarded to the Weekly.</TE>
<TE>   According to Schneiderman, the decision to buy its rival out of
the Los Angeles market also was driven, in part, by an anxiety over
the long-term intentions of Chicago-based Tribune Co., which
publishes The Times.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Wednesday, Schneiderman pointed to what he said
was Tribune's interest in establishing an entertainment-oriented
Chicago publication designed to appeal to the young readers
habitually drawn to free alternative weeklies. If that strategy were
to be extended to Los Angeles, Schneiderman said, it would threaten
the Weekly's lucrative local franchise, which sources say produces
profit of more than 20%. (As a privately held company, Village Voice
Media does not publish such figures).</TE>
<TE>   "In Southern California," Schneiderman said, "we intend to compete
with the Los Angeles Times because, if we don't, we think Tribune
will come in and compete with us for our young readers. The Times is
a journalistic behemoth with lots of advertising dollars. But we have
a desirable young readership, and we think this deal positions us to
get some of that money."</TE>

<LD>MILAN--Watch it wiggle, see it jiggle. When model Amber Valletta's
backside is shaking like Jello on the runway, women of the real world
don't stand a chance with the tiny skirts that were the biggest news
here this week.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel like I should start my diet now," said Lesley Jane
Seymour, the already-svelte editor-in-chief of Marie Claire magazine.
Even Valletta admitted that a hands-on approach was required to keep
Versace's bubble-gum pink micro-mini from riding up while on the
runway. "But it's fun," she said backstage after the show.</LD>
<LD>   Fun for her maybe, but those watching the week's monotonous stream
of skirts skimpier than some belts saw more moon than Buzz Aldrin.</LD>
<TE>   There are other fashion buzzwords for spring--color, prints,
1960s, gladiator, Asian--likely to be followed by exclamation points
in countless magazine cover lines. But what the Italian designers
really had on their minds was sex, which only occasionally translated
into inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   Sexy is something Versace has never had trouble with, but
sophistication is another matter. This collection lacked the
refinement Donatella seemed to be honing in her splendid fall line.
Jackets and thigh-high skirts in Miami Beach colors and
grommet-trimmed pants with "Donatella" spelled out in Gothic letters
across the backside (as if anyone could miss the collection's focal
point) seemed to pucker and pull even on model-perfect bodies.</TE>
<TE>   For night, chain-mail camisoles were paired with more short
skirts. There also were lots of curve-surfing dresses. One of the
best was in colorblocked chiffon with a single canary-yellow shoulder
strap and a flirty short skirt. But it was a sheer lace cocktail
dress with a plunging neckline and silver sequin insets that made
front-rower Britney Spears' jaw drop. Other pieces lacked the same
wow factor, namely a lipstick-red chiffon confection with a pleated
short skirt and gold sequin trim that would have played better on the
ice rink than the runway.</TE>
<TE>   There was more to like at Versus, Versace's diffusion line. Sure,
the naughty schoolgirl-meets-Patti Smith look isn't new, but Elvis
has the No. 1 hit in the U.K. right now, so what is? It was here, on
a button-down cotton shirt, a jean jacket and a clutch purse that
Donatella's kaleidoscope prints from the fall season landed, this
time with a vibrant mix of flowers and stripes. A pink pleated
"kilt," lime-green bikini and pink-and-red striped miniskirt suit
were all accessorized with studded black leather belts, silver chain
necklaces, enamel flower pins and handbags sprinkled with grommets to
round out the punk rock-princess look.</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Cavalli traveled to Asia via the boudoir with loads of
exquisite chinoiserie print pieces sexed up with waist-cinching
corsetry. There were come hither cheongsam mini dresses in Asian
print silk; fur-trimmed kimonos; and flowing chiffon skirts with
waist-high slits in front and corseting around the hips.</TE>
<TE>   Cavalli took a break from denim, hand-painting matte leather pants
with golden dragons down the sides instead. Also in the casual camp
were Asian-print blouses with back corset lacing and billowy sleeves,
accessorized with red lacquered stilettos with gilt chain ankle
straps and filigree bracelets worn on the upper arm.</TE>
<TE>   Giorgio Armani gets kudos for being one of the few designers to
show clothing for women not interested in playing the seductress, but
the results were mixed. He opened the marathon show with his new take
on a suit: long, double-breasted jackets worn open over sexy,
cleavage-baring knits and lean pants, all in hues of coffee, gray and
robin's-egg blue. Skirts came skinny and tough to walk in; full and
voluminous with origami-like folds; or sheer and beaded to the knee
before fanning out into a mess of unfinished fabric strips.</TE>
<TE>   Beaded evening gowns, studied carefully by guests Sophia Loren,
Kim Cattrall and Tina Turner, had a Moroccan flavor. Not one to let
it go, Armani even sneaked in a few split skirts that echoed his
universally panned harem pants for fall. Better to stick with the
designer's long skirts in gray, blue and pink silk shantung stripes,
worn with easy, tie-front jackets and pointy mules--perfect for an
evening in Marrakesh or Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   At Miu Miu, Miuccia Prada was inspired by vintage Hawaiian tourist
garb to create fresh-looking cheongsam tops, easy-fitting coats, lean
Bermuda shorts and a 1950s bathing suit in cheery, two-toned hibiscus
prints. But halfway through the collection, she seemed to lose her
way in an array of puzzling tent jackets which rested off-kilter on
the shoulders, cutoff sweatshirt tops and white, empire-waist
dresses.</TE>
<TE>   Footwear ranged from open-toed platform pumps in 1970s Andrea
Pfister-like patchwork snakeskin to wedge-heeled trainers with Velcro
closures. Prada also continued to play with plastic, fashioning a
kind of Shrinky Dink flower lei out of crumpled pieces of translucent
plastic. "I don't like fake jewels," she said after the show. "But if
they have to be fake, they should be really exaggerated."</TE>
<TE>   Marni proved why it's the real deal with Reese Witherspoon and
other hot young Hollywood things. Pants were the standout in florals,
ticking stripes or leather, cropped to the shin with a fuller leg and
tabs on the ankles. There were shrunken blazers or soft camisoles to
go with them, or for boho chicks, apron tops and romantic
flower-print chiffon dresses worn over pants. The belts were the only
thing out of step here--chunky brown leather with gold hardware
didn't suit the sweetly sexy style.</TE>
<TE>   After two seasons, Chris Bailey seems to have found his groove at
Burberry Prorsum. Sharing the same youthful energy as Marc Jacobs'
Marc line, the collection offered weightless silk miniskirts in
lavender or lemon-yellow in subtle, tone-on-tone plaid; 1960s-era
striped stovepipe pants; and several must-have jackets including a
silver quilted varsity-style and an anorak in tissue-thin
lemon-yellow silk. The finale, a shrunken blazer in a distressed
cotton, celery-green version of the house's signature check, was
dandy.</TE>
<TE>   The mantra at the runway shows that ended in Milan on Tuesday
could have been sit pretty, breathe deeply and inhale the fashion
haze. High on sex and rock 'n' roll, designers, editors and buyers
alike were toeing the company line, and it was easy to be seduced.</TE>
<TE>   Italian fashion crown jewel Gucci Group's second-quarter profit
was down 55% and Tom Ford is showing $2,000 bum-skimming skirts. No
problem, he said. It's basic black pants that aren't selling. World
leaders are saber-rattling over Iraq, but no matter. "After a fall of
all-black, designers are giving us plenty of reasons to shop and to
buy," Marie Claire editor Seymour said. And sure the economy,
fashion's fair-weather friend, is tanking. But Neiman Marcus fashion
director Joan Kaner has no choice but to buy like there is a
tomorrow. "If it's wonderful," she said, "we'll walk right in."</TE>
<TE>   The thing is, when the music stops and the smoke clears, will
shoppers do the same?</TE>

<HD>The No-Sweat Sportswear</HD>
<DH>Fashion Active Lab's low-upkeep duds use luxury blends for
a stylish, go-anywhere look</DH>

<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All those futuristic visions of the 21st century invariably included
a wardrobe of simple, unisex, high-tech uniforms. Fortunately, that
look has never materialized, but something more attractive has.</LD>
<LD>   A fusion of fashion and active wear, Fashion Active Lab, or FAL
for short, blends luxury fibers such as cashmere with a minimalist
sports vibe to make distinctive men's and women's clothes. The
tailored jackets, cashmere sweaters and simple skirts and pants have
the comfort of sweats, but are elegant enough for a restaurant or
casual workplace. Everything is wrinkle resistant, color coordinated
and washable.</LD>
<LD>   Designer Jeffrey Grubb, 40, launched the women's line three years
ago and the men's this fall. "The collection really incorporates my
whole life experience," the designer said from his Manhattan atelier.
Grubb is a native Minnesotan-turned-New Yorker who is a former
gymnast, fitness trainer, gym owner and veteran of fashion showrooms,
retail stores and designer ateliers, such as Industria and Andrew
Dibben.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel like the world, along with me, is rejecting the conformity
of the shirt and tie," he said. "We all work very hard, and we go a
lot of places on the run. The clothes we require have to work with
us, not against us."</TE>
<TE>   Toward that end, the multi-tasking collection offers
high-performance separates that range from $45 for a Pima cotton
shirt to $180 for a cashmere sweater to $900 for a techno-cashmere
sweater that's stretchy, machine washable and sometimes lined with
moisture-wicking fabrics. The techno-suede skirts, pants and jackets
are softer than previous synthetic versions and also washable. That
means white is now an option for subway riders and fans of messy
food.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing was to inject luxury into it, which gives it a
certain amount of acceptance in different places," said Grubb, whose
synthetics often look natural, while the natural fibers are often
tweaked to improve performance. To make dressing simpler, Grubb
selected the colors and textures of each season's groupings to create
an interchangeable wardrobe of sleek basics. He added conveniences
such as a locker loop, extra-long sleeves, zippers in sleeve cuffs
and elastic in waists, and he eliminated logos. As for the image of
Jimi Hendrix woven into a cashmere sweater? That's just for cool.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really good travel clothes," said Hollywood stylist Phillip
Bloch, who has outfitted client Halle Berry in FAL. "It packs well,
it washes well and it looks great. Everything these days is so boring
or too freaky. This is luxe with simplicity."</TE>
<TE>   The collection hit a chord with customers at Savannah, a Santa
Monica boutique, where most of the first fall shipment sold within a
week, said owner Susan Stone. "I'm going to wear this on the plane to
Milan," said Stone as she showed a Pima cotton T-shirt and a pair of
trousers with a disguised elastic waist. "It's very modern clothing.
A sporty look is so important in fashion, but these don't look like
you're wearing Michael Jordan's clothes."</TE>
<TE>   FAL isn't the first collection to offer high-performance designer
clothing. However, Grubb's efforts evolve ideas set forth by pioneers
Norma Kamali, Francois Girbaud and even Miuccia Prada. Unlike some of
those designer lines, FAL offers a range of lower-priced pieces that
helps remove the feeling of preciousness--and the guilt over wearing
it to the gym or playground.</TE>
<TE>   The collection's emphasis on layering and comfort particularly
meets the needs of the California lifestyle, Stone said. Boutiques,
such as Theodore, Fred Segal Flair and R.K. Shugart, have been
especially receptive to the line. Linda Dresner is installing a
special FAL section in her namesake New York boutique on Park Avenue.
Department stores haven't decided, exactly, where the collection
belongs. Neiman Marcus tends to stock it in the designer sportswear
department, while Saks Fifth Avenue skews its selection toward the
more technical fabrics and sells the collection in the contemporary
sportswear department. The collection allows for a lot of
interpretation, even in the mind of its creator.</TE>
<TE>   "This piece is what Jeff wants people to wear in the future," said
Susan Beischel, spokeswoman for Fashion Active Lab, pulling a
stretchy men's jumpsuit from a rack at the Hatch showroom at L.A.'s
New Mart. "Just one piece to put on," she said of the jumpsuit that
looked, well, like those unisex uniforms designers are always
touting. That's the problem with fashion visionaries. They're ready
for revolution when the rest of us are just trying to keep up with
evolution.</TE>

<HD>OK for Eastern Gal to Dodge the Western Wear</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: We have been invited to attend a wedding in
Southern California for a couple who have horses. It will be a
Western-themed wedding with the bride and groom on horseback. I was
born and raised in New England, and since moving to Southern
California, I have been shocked by the attire at weddings, from beach
wear to Hawaiian shirts, shorts, etc. It's not what I was taught
about being respectful to the event.</LD>
<LD>   What would be appropriate attire for this function? I'd feel as if
I was attending a costume party if I attempted Western attire, but I
also don't want to be way overdressed.</LD>
<LD>   --OLD FASHIONED GAL</LD>
<TE>   Dear Gal: What? You're not keen on dressing up in an Annie Oakley
outfit and firing off your six-shooter? What is wrong with you?</TE>
<TE>   Seriously, we've never been big on theme weddings that require the
guests to dress a certain way, i.e., all white, or medieval garb, or
clown clothes. Even when there is no forced dress code, as in your
case, having a theme still puts subtle pressure on the attendees to
conform to it.</TE>
<TE>   Since you're not a Wild West kind of gal, we suggest opting for a
nice daytime outfit--something you'd wear to lunch at an upscale
restaurant, or a religious service, or an opera or play matinee. If
you feel inclined to give a small nod to Western wear you can opt for
some turquoise and silver jewelry, cowboy boots or a fringed suede
jacket. We're going to guess that since equines are involved that at
least part of the service will be held outdoors, so bring a cover-up
in case it gets chilly. Also, wear low-heeled shoes--no stilettos,
just in case you have to ride off into the sunset.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: I am in my early 40s and work in an office
that has a business-casual dress code. I have a lot of knee-length
wool, silk and gabardine skirts that I mix with sweaters or blazers.
It seems that sheer pantyhose are hopelessly out of style, since
everyone seems to have bare legs. Now that it's getting cooler, that
doesn't seem appropriate. On the other hand, it seems to be too early
in the season for opaque tights. What do you suggest for an updated
look?</TE>
<TE>   --BEYOND BARE</TE>
<TE>   Dear Beyond: To get the latest scoop on looks for legs, we spoke
with Sally Kay, president of the North Carolina-based Hosiery Assn.,
a trade organization representing the leg-wear industry. The good
news is that you have several choices of how to clad your legs in
this post-summer, pre-autumn period. The bad news is ... well, there
is no bad news.</TE>
<TE>   If you want to achieve that bare-legged look but still have
coverage, Kay said, look for pantyhose labeled "ultrasheer" and try
to find the color that best matches your skin tone. We've seen women
wearing these and we were hard pressed to tell at first if they were
even wearing hose.</TE>
<TE>   Your second option is lightly textured hose, a big look for fall.
Looks include herringbone tweeds, basket weave patterns,
fishnets--even lace. Granted, your office may be too conservative for
lacey legs, but a faint herringbone pattern probably won't raise too
many eyebrows.</TE>
<TE>   Not all tights are ultra-heavy; some are between sheer and opaque
and are perfect for transitional months. Think color, too, especially
monochromatic looks in rust, chocolate, charcoal and brandy.</TE>
<TE>   For more information on all kinds of hosiery, visit the
association's Web site at www.hosieryassociation.com.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: I recently purchased a beaded blouse at a
thrift store that I fell in love with. Now that it has a spot in my
wardrobe, I have no idea how or where to wear it. It's linen and long
sleeved and has pearl beads all over the front in a fleur-de-lis
pattern. The tips of the collar are also beaded.</TE>
<TE>   --THRIFTY SHOPPER</TE>
<TE>   Dear Thrifty: Lucky you--embellished blouses and sweaters have
continued through another season, so your thrift store find is in
step with today's looks.</TE>
<TE>   Your blouse can be worn a number of different ways with a number
of different pieces. You can dress it down with a pair of blue or
black jeans. Wear it with a straight skirt for a dinner engagement,
or to the office with a nice pair of pants or skirt, providing you
don't work in an extremely traditional, conservative place. Even
though the blouse is beaded, linen is not a terribly dressy fabric,
so we'd avoid trying to incorporate it into an evening outfit.</TE>
<TE>   Keep the jewelry and accessories to a minimum, since the blouse
itself is eye-catching. Some small pearl earrings or a pearl bracelet
would be enough.</TE>

<LD>Part 5 The story so far: Archie's family has asked both orphans if
they would like to stay with them.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Martin and Cora nodded. Archie smiled at them and then at his
folks.</LD>
<TE>   Pa and the agent signed the papers that turned the children over
to the care of the Wilkins family. The papers also noted that they
could adopt the children in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Martin and Cora waved goodbye and climbed onto the wagon with
Archie.</TE>
<TE>   The sun shone brightly as they rolled along. A gentle breeze blew.
Cora held her carved horse tightly.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes everyone chatted. Sometimes everyone was silent.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Ma said, "I hope we are all hungry for supper."</TE>
<TE>   Martin and Cora whispered to each other.</TE>
<TE>   At last Martin asked, "Will we have to eat boiled onions?"</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, no," Archie, Ma, and Pa exclaimed together.</TE>
<TE>   "They made us eat boiled onions at the orphanage," Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   "We hate them," Cora added.</TE>
<TE>   "We're having roast chicken and corn," Ma said.</TE>
<TE>   "That sounds fine, ma'am," Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   "You bet it is," Archie said as the wagon rolled up to the
farmhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Historical Note: Between 1854 and 1929 thousands of homeless
children rode the rails to find new homes. Overcrowded eastern cities
were filled with ragged and hungry youngsters, mostly immigrants
whose parents had died of illness or were too poor to care for them.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Charles Loring Brace of New York City's Children's Aid
Society was the first to arrange the "placing out" of orphans to
families in the Midwest and West. The trains that carried them became
known as orphan trains. Soon other orphanages established similar
programs. The infants and toddlers sometimes were called trolley or
streetcar babies. Such an "adventure" for a child was often
frightening and confusing. Not everyone ended up in a happy
situation, but many children were welcomed and well cared for.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Smiler Levinson's latest title, "North Pole/South Pole," a
Holiday House easy reader science book, is out this week. This story
will be on The Times' Web site at www.latimes.com/kids. A new,
five-part story begins on Monday.</TE>

<HD>Stewart Quits NYSE Board Amid Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martha Stewart, a former stockbroker who built a media company around
her homemaking prowess, quit the board of the New York Stock Exchange
on Thursday amid an investigation into her sale of ImClone Systems
Inc. shares.</LD>
<LD>   The 61-year-old Stewart's resignation is a sign the
insider-trading probe is hurting her image, some analysts said. In
July, she gave up her appearances on CBS television's "The Early
Show" because she didn't want to answer questions about the probe.</LD>
<LD>   "The NYSE must have members on the board who are above suspicion
and reproach of any kind, and obviously she doesn't fit that category
at this point in time," said Hal Vogel, a media analyst with Vogel
Capital.</LD>
<TE>   A board panel will meet to select a potential replacement over the
next few weeks, NYSE Chairman Richard Grasso said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. have plummeted 67%
since June 6, the day before a congressional panel said it was
investigating Stewart's ImClone sale. Martha Stewart Living shares
dropped 59 cents to $6.21 in NYSE trading Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Regulators Join Forces on Brokerage Reform</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>State and federal securities regulators will draw up a unified set of
demands and present them to major brokerages in the next few weeks in
hopes of resolving the multiple probes of alleged Wall Street
misconduct, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the New York Stock Exchange and the NASD (formerly the
National Assn. of Securities Dealers) on Thursday proposed new rules
governing stock analysts' practices.</LD>
<LD>   Public pressure for broad-based reform of brokerages has mounted
in recent months amid the wave of revelations about potentially
tainted analyst advice and awards of new-stock offerings to certain
clients in the 1990s.</LD>
<TE>   Regulators, including Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Harvey Pitt and New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer, said their joint
effort could speed a universal settlement with brokerages. Regulators
want a resolution to lift the cloud of scandal that has hung over
financial markets; brokerages are eager to end their public relations
woes.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators said they will present their demands to brokerages and
give them a "brief opportunity" to reply. If a settlement can't be
worked out, regulators then would sue the firms.</TE>
<TE>   The unified approach could bring a "more rapid closure," Spitzer
said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   The coordination also could end what has appeared to be a heated
competition among regulators in their various investigations.</TE>
<TE>   At a minimum, demands for reform are expected to include
requirements that brokerages protect their research analysts from
influence by investment bankers.</TE>
<TE>   The NYSE and NASD, in their proposal Thursday, sought to ban
analysts from "pitch" meetings at which brokerages solicit banking
business from companies.</TE>
<TE>   Another proposal would require that a special committee at each
brokerage determine analyst compensation based on stock-picking
performance, with no consideration given to analysts' contributions
to investment banking.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, the NYSE and NASD said 11 people were named to a
committee that will look into reforms of the initial public stock
offering process.</TE>

<HD>Universal Studios Japan Chief Resigns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>The president of Universal Studios Japan resigned Thursday over
operating problems that have slashed attendance, tarnished the park's
image and delivered visitors thrills they hadn't bargained for:
restaurants serving expired food, drinking fountains spewing
unsanitary water and shows using excessive explosives.</LD>
<LD>   Akira Sakata, president of USJ Co., which operates the park,
apologized for the trouble.</LD>
<LD>   He will be replaced by Shin Sasaki, a former official of the Osaka
city government, the park's largest shareholder, owning about 25%.</LD>
<TE>   The L.A.-based senior vice president of Universal Parks and
Resorts, Jim Yeager, said he did not believe the controversy affected
attendance. Other executives said the problems have been resolved.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood-inspired theme park--the first outside the U.S. for
Vivendi Universal's Universal Studios--opened in March 2001 to rave
reviews. It reached its first-year target of 8 million visitors by
November, about four months ahead of schedule.</TE>
<TE>   But the park was plagued by problems that grew even bigger over
the summer.</TE>
<TE>   In July, health officials found high levels of bacteria in the
water at six drinking fountains. The park acknowledged that cooks had
been routinely using outdated salami sausage, rice crackers and other
ingredients to prepare food at the park's 21 restaurants. It also
admitted it had falsely reported the explosives it had used and
stored for four shows.</TE>
<TE>   Attendance plunged to 1.26 million in July and August, down a
quarter from 1.67 million in the same period a year ago.</TE>

<HD>Early Retiree Tax Rules Eased</HD>
<DH>Finances: Government won't penalize those who alter
withdrawal rates for 401(k) or IRA plans hurt by market losses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The federal government said Thursday that it has relaxed tax rules
that penalize thousands of early retirees whose savings have been
slammed by the bear market, but stopped short of providing the same
help to millions of older retirees who complain that they suffer from
much the same problem.</LD>
<LD>   "Taxpayers have worked hard to build their retirement savings.
They shouldn't be penalized when the market is down," Pamela Olson,
assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, said in a statement.</LD>
<LD>   The change, effective immediately, eliminates tax penalties for
early retirees who want to slow their rate of withdrawal from
qualified retirement plans such as 401(k)s and individual retirement
accounts before they are 59 1/2.</LD>
<TE>   "In all the previous rules and regulations, the possibility that a
retirement account balance could decline from year to year was never
even considered," said Ed Slott, a retirement tax expert in New York.
"But in the past couple of years, people's retirement balances have
not just been declining, they're in a free fall. This ruling has been
long awaited."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the effect of the declining market has hit early
retirees--whose numbers are estimated in the tens of
thousands--particularly hard. That's mainly because early retirees
who want to tap into qualified plans were forced to make an
irrevocable decision when they retired that spelled out just how much
they would withdraw each year.</TE>
<TE>   All the formulas retirees could choose from assumed the accounts
would continue to earn investment returns. The declining market
wrecked those plans, and withdrawal rates set in good times are now
threatening to empty the plans prematurely. But early retirees were
prohibited from changing the withdrawal without triggering a 10%
retroactive tax penalty that could run into the thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The new rule allows early retirees to change their withdrawal
amount, without penalty, and calculate the right amount based on the
current value of their account. It also makes clear that the Internal
Revenue Service won't further penalize retirees who stop making
withdrawals for the simple reason that the value of their account has
dropped to zero.</TE>
<TE>   "They're capping your losses at 100%," Slott said. "That may not
sound good, but it's an improvement."</TE>
<TE>   The new rules don't address the concerns of millions of older
retirees who say they're also penalized by tax rules that force them
to take money out of their accounts based on a formula that could
prematurely deplete them.</TE>
<TE>   "I have exactly the same problem," said Gerald Shearer, a retired
engineer who lives in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to take out twice as much from my retirement plan as I
should if I were basing the withdrawal on my current account
balance."</TE>
<TE>   Treasury officials said Thursday that they had no plans to review
mandatory withdrawal regulations for those who are older than 70 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   "We just finalized those regulations," said William F. Sweetnam,
benefits tax counsel for the Treasury.</TE>
<TE>   "In [those rules], there is always going to be a lag. If the value
of your account goes down, you are stuck making [bigger withdrawals].
But if it goes back up the following year, you can make a smaller
withdrawal. It's just a timing difference."</TE>

<HD>Antitrust Chief to Quit; Microsoft Case in Flux</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Justice Department antitrust chief Charles A. James said Thursday
that he would step down after less than a year and a half on the job,
leaving the landmark Microsoft Corp. settlement and several other key
cases in flux.</LD>
<LD>   James, who was confirmed by the Senate as assistant attorney
general in charge of antitrust 14 months ago, will become vice
president and general counsel of ChevronTexaco Corp., the nation's
second-largest oil company, on Dec. 9. He will leave his government
post around Thanksgiving.</LD>
<LD>   Big businesses, especially Microsoft, may lament the departure of
James, 48, whom critics accused of going easy on the software giant
and harboring a lenient attitude toward antitrust enforcement.</LD>
<TE>   Although the Microsoft case may be wrapped up before James leaves,
his replacement probably would play a key role in enforcing any
court-ordered antitrust remedies against the company. A ruling in the
4 1/2-year-old case is expected any day.</TE>
<TE>   Several other major antitrust cases also are pending, including
probes of alleged airline industry price fixing; Hollywood's bid to
sell music and movies online; and a review of the proposed
$15-billion merger of the nation's two main satellite-TV providers,
EchoStar Communications Corp. and DirecTV.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft did not immediately nominate a
replacement for James. And the Senate, which will recess just weeks
after James' departure, could take two to three months to confirm a
new antitrust chief.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation about possible successors focused on William J.
Kolasky, a Washington antitrust lawyer who serves as James' deputy
for international affairs. He is a political supporter of Sen. John
McCain (R-Ariz.).</TE>
<TE>   If nominated and approved, Kolasky would possibly have to recuse
himself from the Microsoft case because he filed a
friend-of-the-court brief two years ago on behalf of a group of
software developers that supports Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   How the business community would be affected by James' departure
is unclear, said Jeffrey A. Eisenach, a director of the
Washington-based Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation think tank who served
as a Federal Trade Commission economist during the Reagan
administration.</TE>
<TE>   "But I don't think Microsoft is likely to find a friendlier
antitrust chief than Charles James," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say James' resignation could prolong the Justice
Department's review of the proposed merger of EchoStar and DirecTV.
Representatives of DirecTV parent Hughes Electronics Corp. in El
Segundo met with Justice Department staffers last week and were
scheduled to confer again today as they try to gain the department's
blessing.</TE>
<TE>   James is opposed to the merger, which would reduce the number of
U.S. satellite TV providers from three to two. Though his successor
could share that view, Hughes would welcome the additional time it
may get to win political support.</TE>
<TE>   James drew both praise and scorn for his efforts to streamline
antitrust enforcement. He leaves a Justice Department whose clout and
stature have grown considerably during the last decade amid an
explosion of corporate mergers and the rise of the global economy.</TE>
<TE>   Among James' achievements are a reorganization of Justice
Department staff and improved coordination of antitrust enforcement
with regulators overseas.</TE>
<TE>   But James was forced to mothball a controversial bid to formally
divide corporate merger reviews between the Justice Department and
the FTC.</TE>
<TE>   James also has been dogged by criticism that he is not an
aggressive antitrust enforcer, even though he pursued several big
antitrust cases that began during the Clinton administration. This
year, he asked a federal judge to reinstate a price-fixing case
against AMR Corp.'s American Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   James has largely weathered his controversial efforts to settle
the landmark Microsoft antitrust case.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed settlement calls for Microsoft to disclose the
technical details of its Windows operating system software that
enable it to work with products from rival software developers.</TE>
<TE>   The plan is endorsed by half of the original group of 18 states
that joined the federal government in pursuing an antitrust case
against Microsoft, whose Windows software controls more than 90% of
all personal computers. But some critics, including California Atty.
Gen. Bill Lockyer, say the settlement is riddled with loopholes and
are pressing for tougher remedies.</TE>

<HD>Investors Get Look at Power Bond Deal</HD>
<DH>Securities: Treasurer issues prospectus on California's
$11.9-billion financing. Analysts are mixed over risk involved. Some
fear another crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Potential investors in the California power bond deal--the biggest
sale of municipal bonds in U.S. history--on Thursday got their first
detailed look at the securities in a 362-page prospectus issued by
state Treasurer Phil Angelides.</LD>
<LD>   Institutional investors gave mixed reviews about the appeal of the
bonds relative to the risks involved. But some financial advisors
said California individual investors hungry for yield may flock to
the securities. Most of the bonds will pay interest that is exempt
from state and federal income tax.</LD>
<LD>   The $11.9-billion financing, more than a year late because of
repeated delays from legal challenges and political wrangling, will
help repay the state's general fund and commercial banks for
financing the purchase of electricity during the state's power crisis
in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Angelides said Thursday that he would be meeting with investors in
seven cities including New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles
beginning Oct. 11 to explain the deal.</TE>
<TE>   The bonds are "supported by substantial protections, statutory
protections and substantial reserves," Angelides said in a pitch to
garner the lowest yields possible for the state.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a structure here that is rational, and it's clear what
some of the risks are," said Dan Solender, portfolio manager of about
$5 billion in California municipal bonds for mutual fund giant
Vanguard Group. Even so, he said, "we haven't decided yet" on bidding
for the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   A key question, according to many institutional investors, is what
happens if the state stays in the power-buying business and there is
another emergency similar to the winter of 2000-01, when California
was short of energy and its major utilities were financially unable
to buy power.</TE>
<TE>   Money to pay interest on the bonds and to ultimately retire the
securities will come from a surcharge that customers of Southern
California Edison, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and San Diego Gas &amp;
Electric will pay each month.</TE>
<TE>   The state also plans to hold $1.8 billion from the offering in
reserve to back the bonds. But some investors fear that those
reserves could be quickly drained if the state must resume buying
power.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest risk I see is that the state is still susceptible to
the power market, which is to a great degree beyond their control,"
said Linda Brisson, a research analyst with mutual fund firm T. Rowe
Price Associates. "There is a lot to handle here, a lot to absorb.
These are complex issues."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the concerns, California individual investors are expected
to be hungry for the securities, given the alternatives--including a
stock market that continues to slide and Treasury bond yields that
are at 40-year lows.</TE>
<TE>   About $5 billion of adjustable-rate power bonds are expected to be
sold the week of Oct. 21 by the state Department of Water Resources,
the agency that bought power during the energy crunch. The balance of
the $11.9-billion offering will be sold afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Large Wall Street investors are expected to purchase most of the
adjustable-rate bonds. Individual investors are expected to be a key
audience for the fixed-rate bonds expected to be sold in November
with maturities ranging from two years to 20 years and in increments
as small as $5,000, said Zane Mann, publisher of the California
Municipal Bond Advisor newsletter in Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite all that's gone on with these bonds, they are a hell of a
deal" if the yields come in as expected, Mann said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, three major credit-rating firms assigned the power
bonds investment-grade ratings, though the grades of A-minus and
BBB-plus are below the highest possible ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Recent average market interest rates on 20-year munis rated
A-minus have been in the 5% to 5.5% range. That contrasts with the
current yield of 3.69% on a 10-year Treasury note and 4.73% on
30-year Treasury bonds.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, because the power bond interest is tax-exempt, the
true yield will be much higher, depending on an investor's tax
bracket.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the power bonds will be competing with a flood of other
California securities expected in the next few weeks, including as
much as $12 billion in short-term notes and $1 billion in general
obligation bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Investors can get more information about the power bonds at the
state treasurer's Web site: www.treasurer.ca.gov.</TE>

<HD>How Courtney Love Lost Her Leverage, Settled Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rock star Courtney Love strode into the Beverly Hills Hotel in late
February for the recording industry's hippest party: the annual
pre-Grammy bash thrown by music mogul Clive Davis. When she walked
into the hotel, she had been at war with her record company, Vivendi
Universal's Universal Music Group, for more than a year.</LD>
<LD>   So it was all the more shocking to the music industry heavyweights
present that night to see Love plop down in a chair next to Universal
Music Group President Zach Horowitz and settle in for a two-hour
heart-to-heart talk. It was the first step in a seven-month-long
negotiation that resulted in a complex settlement this week that
freed Love's rock band, Hole, from its recording contract and cleared
the way for Universal to release new recordings by Nirvana, the
iconic grunge rock band led by Love's late husband, Kurt Cobain.</LD>
<LD>   The two sides did not reach a settlement based on personal contact
alone. Sources close to Love say she felt pressure to settle after
losing a series of legal rulings in Los Angeles County Superior Court
and felt her remaining leverage slipping away. Love also was facing
legal bills in a separate lawsuit with the two surviving members of
Nirvana.</LD>
<TE>   Love sued Universal in February 2001, accusing her record company
of using unlawful business practices to keep her locked into an
unfair contract and cheat her out of royalties. Universal blasted
Love's claims as a publicity stunt and a negotiating ploy. The singer
vowed to take the case to the Supreme Court if necessary to help the
artists' rights cause.</TE>
<TE>   Love then filed another lawsuit to block Universal or her late
husband's former bandmates from releasing any Nirvana recordings. The
two musicians, drummer Dave Grohl and bassist Krist Novoselic,
countersued and accused Love of trying to wrest away control of
Nirvana for use as a weapon in Hole's contract dispute with
Universal.</TE>
<TE>   At Davis' Feb. 26 party, as Love entered the hotel ballroom, her
legal problems were near their peak. She was spotted by Lyor Cohen,
chief of Universal's Island Def Jam label.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen approached Love and brought her over to a table full of
Universal's top executives. He seated her next to Horowitz, whom Love
had never met.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of a practical joke," Cohen said. The moment was so
uncomfortable that several Universal executives left the table. But
then, the rock star and the executive began to chat.</TE>
<TE>   Love told Horowitz that she believed marketing executives at
Universal's Interscope Records had broken their promises in the
marketing of Hole's album "Celebrity Skin," which sold about 1.3
million copies, far below expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the first time there was a Universal executive willing to
listen to what she had to say," said James Barber, Love's manager.
Horowitz declined to comment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Horowitz prodded Love to consider a deal and continue her career,
sources said. The two parted still facing a court showdown. But the
ice had been broken.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Love also was becoming isolated from the artists'
rights campaign her lawsuit had helped spark. The night of the party,
the Recording Artists Coalition was staging a series of concerts with
Elton John, No Doubt and other acts around L.A. to raise money for
its campaign for fairer contracts and more accurate accounting of
royalty payments. RAC sources say Love was invited to play a concert
and declined; Love says she wasn't invited.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Love's most powerful leverage against Universal--her
role in the partnership that controlled Nirvana's music--had begun to
erode. Technically, it was unrelated to Hole's dispute, but Love held
an apparent ace: claims to an unreleased, and potentially lucrative,
Nirvana tune believed to be the last song recorded by Cobain, "You
Know You're Right."</TE>
<TE>   Under Nirvana's record contract, the band was required to deliver
a boxed-set CD package in time for the holidays last year. Love,
however, had pitched the idea of instead releasing a single
greatest-hits CD, including the unreleased song. Universal believed
Love's approach would result in the sale of 5 million units, far more
than a boxed set. But both sides had to agree to amend the Nirvana
contract.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the record company and the Nirvana partners reached
the broad terms of a deal by last fall, sources said, but failed to
sign it in time to release the CD for Christmas. In the meantime, Los
Angeles County Superior Court Judge Fumiko Wasserman threw out Love's
broadest claims against Universal, reducing the lawsuit to a more
conventional contract dispute. Wasserman ordered the two sides into
mediation this summer.</TE>
<TE>   During the mediation, sources said, Love and Horowitz met
again--this time privately. By then Universal had raised the
possibility of putting out a Nirvana CD without "You Know You're
Right." The company "tied the two [cases] together," according to one
lawyer familiar with the situation.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the tactic pinned Love in a corner: No longer did she
have the leverage of withholding the song; Universal was ready to
make do without it. By late summer, Love's camp began fearing the
song would leak to the Net, potentially diminishing its value--and
her leverage--even further.</TE>
<TE>   Already reeling from the judge's rulings and her legal bills, Love
decided to accept a deal. Love was freed from her record contract,
received ownership of Hole's unreleased material and is to receive a
$4-million advance against sales of new Nirvana recordings.</TE>
<TE>   Barber, Love's manager, said his client pressed the matter as far
as she could given the circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry reforms that really matter to Courtney, and other
artists, are almost impossible to do in a single contract case," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Defense Is Reclaiming Its Space</HD>
<DH>Southland: Federal spending is expected to rise 10% this
year, fueling demand for jobs and office space, report says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE and JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More office space is going to aerospace.</LD>
<LD>   Federal spending in Southern California, bolstered by a surge in
defense contracts, is expected to rise by nearly 10% this year,
fueling demand for jobs and office space at levels not seen since the
early 1980s.</LD>
<LD>   According to a report to be unveiled today, the Southland's
defense industry is growing again, reversing a two-decade slide and
representing one of the few bright spots in the region's economy.</LD>
<TE>   In the first comprehensive look at the economic impact of the
nation's war on terrorism, the study by real estate research firm
Delta Associates confirms what so far has been largely anecdotal
evidence of a defense buildup in the region. In the last year, local
defense operations have won a bevy of major contracts, reinforcing
the area's leading position in defense research and development.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a regrettable thing to say, but Los Angeles benefits from a
war," said Gregory H. Leisch, chief executive of Delta Associates,
based in Alexandria, Va.</TE>
<TE>   The study estimates that the ramp-up in defense spending will
generate 5,000 local private-sector jobs annually for the next five
years. The report did not consider secondary support jobs that could
be created, which could add 5,000 to 7,500 to the region's payroll,
economists say.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the employment gains, demand for office space is
expected to increase, bolstering prospects for the sluggish
commercial office market, particularly in the South Bay where defense
cuts in the 1990s left many buildings with high vacancy rates.</TE>
<TE>   The South Bay recovered during the dot-com boom of the late '90s,
only to see that industry wither too.</TE>
<TE>   The defense demand for Los Angeles-area office space could reach
as much as 1.25 million square feet a year for the next five years,
with about half of that in the South Bay, according to the study.
Though the demand probably won't make a huge dent in the vacancy
rate--there are about 34 million square feet of available office
space in the Los Angeles area--it still is considered significant.</TE>
<TE>   "Considering how soft the market has been, anything helps," Leisch
said.</TE>
<TE>   The boost for real estate will be diluted in part because defense
contractors, like many other corporations, have so much excess space
that they can accommodate large numbers of new employees without
leasing new space, brokers say. In fact, half of the projected
increase in demand will be absorbed by underutilized facilities,
according to Delta Associates.</TE>
<TE>   "There is substantial capacity ... within most of these companies
to handle the growth," said real estate broker Jerry Porter at Cresa
Partners.</TE>
<TE>   The report estimates that defense spending this year in the region
would increase by 9% to about $14 billion. The spending level is then
expected to grow by an average of about 7% a year over the next five
years, rising to $16.7 billion by 2006. The report did not consider
the potential impact of a war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The study, commissioned by commercial real estate firm
Transwestern Commercial Services, uncovered a trove of data about the
defense industry in Southern California. Researchers analyzed federal
contract awards for firms in Los Angeles and Orange counties, using
the Freedom of Information Act to gain access to figures not readily
available to the public. Among the findings:</TE>
<TE>   * Last year, the federal government awarded $12.8 billion in
contracts for defense work in Los Angeles and Orange counties,
accounting for 92,000 full-time jobs.</TE>
<TE>   * Last year's total was down 30% from a peak of $18.5 billion in
1983.</TE>
<TE>   * More than three-quarters of the contracts were defense-related,
while spending by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
accounted for about 20%.</TE>
<TE>   * With operations in Seal Beach, Anaheim, Long Beach and
Huntington Beach, Boeing Co. was the largest federal contractor,
accounting for about $5 billion in awards last year. Caltech in
Pasadena was second, with $1.5 billion in awards. Next was TRW in
Redondo Beach, with $622 million.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice), said she welcomed the findings, but
worried about repeating the boom-bust cycles that have marked past
defense buildups. "We've seen this movie before," she said, "so I'm
cautiously optimistic."</TE>

<HD>PayPal Shareholders OK Acquisition by EBay</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EBay Inc., already the master of the online auction universe, now
rules the lucrative fiefdom of online payments as well.</LD>
<LD>   Shareholders of PayPal Inc. voted Thursday to approve a
$1.25-billion acquisition that made them part of the EBay empire. In
addition to earning tens of millions of dollars annually in fees from
hosting online auctions, EBay can expect to pocket millions more by
taking a cut of the payments.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, which had not run into any major opposition since it was
announced in July, was ratified at a sparsely attended Palo Alto
shareholders meeting that lasted less than eight minutes.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a lot to bite off, the largest acquisition EBay has made by
a wide margin," said analyst Derek Brown of WR Hambrecht &amp; Co., who
owns EBay stock. (His firm does not own EBay shares or do business
with the company.) "But it does make a lot of sense for them in the
long term."</TE>
<TE>   The vote came while markets were still open. Shares of San
Jose-based EBay fell $1.40 to $51.90 in Nasdaq trading.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours, EBay announced that PayPal Chief Executive Peter
Thiel had resigned. His duties were assumed by Matt Bannick, head of
EBay's global online payments.</TE>
<TE>   PayPal will continue as an independent brand. The payment
service's online gambling business will be phased out.</TE>
<TE>   PayPal facilitates online credit card transactions between buyers
and sellers. More than 60% of PayPal's business is derived from EBay
transactions.</TE>
<TE>   EBay's payment system, Billpoint, was not as popular as PayPal.</TE>
<TE>   "The buyers went to PayPal because that's where the sellers did
business, and vice versa," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   PayPal, which has more than 20 million member accounts, went
public in February. In its only quarterly filing in July, the company
reported a profit of $529,000, or 1 cent a share. EBay has been
profitable every quarter since it went public in September 1998.</TE>
<TE>   This week EBay put on the block its only remaining
bricks-and-mortar auction house, automobile specialist Kruse
International, which EBay acquired in 1999.</TE>

<HD>Service Sector Still Growing</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Growth in the U.S. service sector accelerated in September but
unemployment lines lengthened, according to reports Thursday that
underscored an uneven and jobless recovery.</LD>
<LD>   The Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing
index showed an eighth straight month of growth, rising to 53.9 in
September from 50.9 in August. The index is above the 50 level that
divides growth from contraction and soothed some concerns that the
economy was headed back into recession.</LD>
<LD>   Yet companies shed workers for the 19th straight month even as the
service sector--which makes up about three-quarters of the
economy--expanded. The ISM employment index fell to 46.6 in
September, from 47.3 in August.</LD>
<TE>   Job losses also caused new claims for unemployment benefits to
rise to 417,000 last week, up from a revised 412,000. That was the
sixth straight week above the 400,000 level, which usually is
associated with a rise in the unemployment rate, currently at 5.7%.</TE>
<TE>   The four-week moving average of jobless claims--seen as a more
accurate measure because it smoothes out week-to-week
fluctuations--rose for the eighth straight week to 423,000 in the
week ended Sept. 28, its highest level since May, the Commerce
Department said.</TE>
<TE>   Another report released Thursday showed caution in America's
boardrooms. The Conference Board said its barometer of chief
executive confidence fell sharply in the third quarter to 54, from 61
in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the government said factory orders were unchanged in
August as strong demand for transportation equipment offset declines
in other sectors. Factory orders were flat at $326.6 billion, the
Commerce Department said.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Filming Days Rise 55% Last Month</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Movie, TV, commercial and music video production on the streets of
Los Angeles continues to show signs of recovering from last year's
labor pains.</LD>
<LD>   The number of days spent shooting in public places in Los Angeles
rose 55% in September from the depressed levels of a year earlier,
according to Entertainment Industry Development Corp. film permit
statistics.</LD>
<LD>   Production days totaled 2,828, compared with 1,826 days a year
earlier. Feature film production days more than doubled to 930 from
428. Television shooting days rose 44% to 1,281, commercial
production days climbed 33% to 517, and music video days fell 17% to
100.</LD>
<TE>   One production day is a single day spent on a project. Although
the entertainment agency issues permits only when projects shoot away
from studio lots, the numbers are an indicator of overall production
activity.</TE>
<TE>   Although activity has yet to equal the levels seen in the mid- to
late 1990s, the latest figures do mark the strongest September in
four years and the third straight monthly increase.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a while since we've seen this level of activity," said
Morrie Goldman, the agency's vice president.</TE>
<TE>   September's numbers contrast with a virtual standstill in
production during the last half of 2001. After shooting at a frenetic
pace early last year to squeeze in projects before potential strikes
by actors and writers that never came, studios slowed production
because they were so well-stocked with finished projects.</TE>
<TE>   Through the first nine months of this year, production days were
still down nearly 5% from a year earlier, reflecting the sluggishness
in shooting that carried over from 2001 into the first half of this
year.</TE>

<LD>Gap Inc., which last week tapped the head of Walt Disney Co.'s theme
parks to become its chief executive, awarded its new boss options to
buy 2 million shares of stock at a below-market price.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Pressler, 46, was awarded options to purchase the shares at
$5.92 each, about half the stock's average price of $11.83 a share on
Sept. 25, the day they were awarded, according to papers filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Although compensation experts say the practice of awarding options
at a discounted price generally is frowned on, they also say Gap may
have offered the shares to Pressler at the lower price to compensate
him for benefits left behind at Disney.</LD>
<TE>   "That was the compensation package the board thought was
appropriate," spokesman Alan Marks said, declining to comment
further.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler also was granted options to purchase 1.5 million shares
at $11.83 each and an additional 1.5 million options at $14.79 to
$20.70 a share.</TE>
<TE>   The options vest over the next seven years.</TE>
<TE>   His compensation package also included an annual salary of $1.5
million, a starting bonus of $885,000 and a guaranteed minimum bonus
of almost $1.9 million in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco-based Gap's stock hit a 52-week low Thursday before
closing at $9.17, down 79 cents, in New York Stock Exchange trading.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's largest specialty retailer, which operates more than
4,200 Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy stores worldwide, also said
Thursday that Steven P. Jobs has resigned from its board of
directors.</TE>
<TE>   The 47-year-old chief executive of Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple
Computer Inc. had served on Gap's board since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that their CEO transition is over, Steve thought it was time
to focus on other priorities," Apple spokeswoman Katie Cotton said.
Both companies declined to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   Gap also announced the appointment of former Coca-Cola Co.
executive Penny Hughes, 43, to its board of directors.</TE>

<HD>Longshoremen's Docktionary: Their Lingo Is Anchored in Past</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Hey, tell the wharfinger the gang is hard-timing us and we've got
nothing to dray."</LD>
<LD>   The trouble at West Coast ports has thrown a spotlight on the
colorful language of the docks, spiced with words that date back to
the Middle Ages. Here's a sampling:</LD>
<LD>   * Drayage: noun. The hauling of goods, usually for short
distances, by truck. From "dray," a strong, low cart without sides,
for carrying heavy loads. "The drayage company hauls the containers
to Ontario instead of putting them on the rail cars at the dock."</LD>
<TE>   * Gang: noun. A work crew of stevedores. "Two gangs were
dispatched to unload that ship." The term had been used to refer to a
set of things. It was extended to people in a nautical setting in
17th century Britain, likely from the earlier word "ging."</TE>
<TE>   * Hard-timing: verb. Carrying out a work slowdown, as in "The
longshoremen are hard-timing the shipping lines."</TE>
<TE>   * Longshoreman: noun. Someone employed along the shore. From the
days when most dockworkers were day laborers and recruited at the
last minute by shore-side criers calling, "Men along the shore!"</TE>
<TE>   * Stevedore: noun, verb. A worker employed as an overseer or
laborer in loading and unloading ship cargo; the act of unloading the
cargo. Used as a verb in the sentence, "The gang is going to
stevedore that ship." From the Spanish estivador, taken from estivar,
"to stow"; earlier, in 13th century Latin document, written as
Stivator. In 1788 Massachusetts, written as "stowadores."</TE>
<TE>   * Wharfinger: noun. An owner, keeper or overseer at a wharf or
dock. From a British term of the 1550s, earlier written as
"wharfager."</TE>

<HD>PacifiCare's New HMO to Limit Choice</HD>
<DH>Benefits: The Value Network will offer fewer options based
on price and quality, a radical change that could hold down
health-care costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a major shift in health-care benefits likely to be followed by
others, PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. today will unveil an HMO that
will limit members' choices to a relatively small network of doctors
and hospitals.</LD>
<LD>   The approach marks a radical change from past years when, at the
behest of employers and consumers, health maintenance organizations
offered ever broader networks of medical groups and hospitals. The
thinking was the bigger the network, the better the HMO.</LD>
<LD>   But now, with health premiums rising unchecked, employers and
managed-care companies are moving, albeit gingerly, in the other
direction. Many employers, led by those in California, already are
offering their employees HMOs and other health plans that charge
members higher co-payments for using more expensive hospitals.</LD>
<TE>   PacifiCare's new HMO goes much further. Starting next year,
members who enroll in the plan, called Value Network, will have
available to them about one-third of the hospitals and one-half of
the doctors of a standard HMO. Altogether, there are 300 hospitals
and 250 medical groups in California. Value Network members who use
providers outside the slimmed-down network generally will have to
foot the bills.</TE>
<TE>   Cypress-based PacifiCare, one of California's largest HMO
companies, with 2.3 million members, said the narrow network would
include those providers that have met PacifiCare's cost threshold and
scored high on several quality measures. The new HMO will be offered
only in California.</TE>
<TE>   Some hospitals and doctors have sharply criticized the health
insurance industry's increasing efforts to rate providers on cost and
quality, saying it is an attempt by the HMO companies to gain
leverage in negotiating rates.</TE>
<TE>   Excluded from PacifiCare's new HMO are a number of well-regarded
institutions such as Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA Medical Center
and Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, some of California's largest employers, including Wells
Fargo Bank and Lockheed Martin, have signed up for PacifiCare's new
HMO, although employees at those firms won't learn specifics of the
change until they receive their open-enrollment forms in the next few
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said this type of HMO, which will be offered to tens of
thousands of Californians in open enrollment this fall, could spread
widely because it is seen as one of the few options to hold down
health costs for employers and consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the models everybody is looking to," said Helen
Darling, president of the Washington Business Group on Health, which
represents 175 major companies in the United States. "There will be
some people who embrace it, some who don't. But I think that's the
direction we're headed in."</TE>
<TE>   The main appeal for employers is the prospect of lower health
benefits costs. Darling said a recent survey of her member
companies--which sponsor health insurance for about 40 million
Americans--showed average health-care costs rising 14% to 18% next
year. Employees will be sharing in those cost increases through
bigger contributions for premiums and higher co-payments.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Sam Ho, PacifiCare's chief medical director, said the new HMO
would reduce an employer's premium increases by 6% to 16%. Some
employers said those savings would be passed on to employees.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been encouraging [PacifiCare] to develop something like
this for some period of time," said Sally Welborn, Wells Fargo's vice
president of corporate benefits. "We really believe there are
differences in the quality of care between hospitals, medical groups
and physicians. Some provide good quality, but are not aggressive on
pricing. We can't afford to pay more for something that can be
equally had at a lower price."</TE>
<TE>   Welborn said PacifiCare's new HMO would be offered as an option,
along with the standard HMO, to the bank's 30,000 employees in
California.</TE>
<TE>   She said there is no way of knowing how many will sign up for the
new option, which will be cheaper. Welborn declined to reveal how
much, saying only that the savings to Wells Fargo will be less than
10%.</TE>
<TE>   Like many big employers, Wells Fargo is taking other steps to
reduce premiums, including boosting co-payments from $15 to $20 for
doctor visits.</TE>
<TE>   But the use of quality and cost measures to differentiate among
providers--and develop various health plans around them--is seen as a
revolutionary step that could transform the health-care marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about a cultural change for employers--from broad
access equals high quality to selective access equals high quality,"
said Kirby Bosley, who heads the health-care practice at Mercer Human
Resource Consulting in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Bosley said it would take time before this change catches on. She
said some employers are waiting to see how consumers react to this
HMO before making the leap.</TE>
<TE>   Other major health plans, including WellPoint Health Networks and
Blue Shield of California, are developing and refining quality and
cost ratings for providers. PacifiCare is preparing for consumers a
separate quality index that rates hospitals by dozens of measures.</TE>
<TE>   "Hospitals have absolutely no problem being held accountable for
quality," said Jan Emerson, spokeswoman for the California Healthcare
Assn., the hospital trade group. "But the issue is, we need to
understand what the quality indicators are and what the methodology
is in determining quality."</TE>
<TE>   Emerson said the concern was that HMOs would "hide behind the
cloak of quality" to steer patients to hospitals strictly on the
basis of contracted costs.</TE>
<TE>   Ho of PacifiCare said his company has had quality ratings for
medical groups for the last four years, based on preventive
screenings, disease management and patient surveys.</TE>
<TE>   He said the hospital quality measures for the Value Network were
taken from the Leapfrog Group, a coalition of major companies
advocating better health care.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Fall on Earnings Worries</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks slumped in a wobbly session Thursday as sour outlooks from
companies such as chip maker Advanced Micro Devices and Bank of New
York overshadowed surprising strength in the service sector of the
U.S. economy.</LD>
<LD>   "The volatility reflects ambiguity and uncertainty," said Hugh
Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany, as the blue-chip
Dow crisscrossed the break-even line much of the day. "You have some
news that is good and some news that is not so good."</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 38.42 points, or
0.5%, at 7,717.19. The Nasdaq composite index fell 21.74 points, or
1.8%, to 1,165.56. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index lost 8.96 points,
or 1.1%, to 818.95.</LD>
<TE>   Losers beat out winners by 4 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange
and Nasdaq in moderate trading.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow rallied almost 160 points in early trading after a report
showed that growth in the services sector picked up in September to
its fastest pace since July. But other data showed a rise in weekly
jobless claims, heightening concern before the September employment
report due out today.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate profit warnings also helped shoo investors out of the
market. Advanced Micro sank 32.4%, losing $1.74 to $3.63 after
warning that quarterly revenue would be below expectations. Rival
chip maker Intel lost 46 cents to $13.84. Chip equipment-making
leader Applied Materials sank $1 to $11.50. The SOX semiconductor
index tumbled 6.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of New York fell $2.81 to $23.95 and helped pressure other
financial stocks. The company warned late Wednesday of lower
third-quarter earnings because of charges for bad loans and losses on
bank stock holdings.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup lost $1.09 to $28.51, Comerica, which also issued a
profit warning Wednesday, fell $2.43 to $37.57 and J.P. Morgan Chase
fell 63 cents to $17.62. A key index of bank stocks dropped 5.3%.</TE>
<TE>   "Earnings in general have been terrible and that has put a lid on
this market," said Burton Schlichter, senior market analyst with
Lind-Waldock. "As long as these warnings come out, we should not
expect a rebound soon."</TE>
<TE>   But investors got an encouraging outlook from chemicals giant
DuPont, which added 43 cents to $37.74, and an upbeat brokerage call
on chip giant Motorola, which gained 31 cents to $10.46.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Crude oil had its biggest drop in three weeks after Hurricane
Lili hit Louisiana with less force than predicted, easing concern
that offshore rigs and coastal refineries would be damaged. In New
York trading, crude fell 73 cents to $29.76.</TE>
<TE>   * Irvine-based chip maker Broadcom fell $1.33, or 11.6%, to $10.18
after Salomon Smith Barney analyst Clark Westmont downgraded the
stock from "in-line" to "under-perform"--the equivalent of a "sell"
recommendation in Salomon's stock-rating system.</TE>
<TE>   * Japan's benchmark Nikkei index fell 1.3%, closing below 9,000
for the first time in 19 years. Bank stocks were especially hard hit
on concerns the government will force banks to write off their bad
loans.</TE>

<HD>Office Rental Market Still Sliding</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles regional office market continued to weaken during the
third quarter as steadily rising vacancies and falling rents
overshadowed a few signs of strength, such as growth in the defense
industry.</LD>
<LD>   Brokers complained about a lack of deal making as economic
uncertainty leaves few tenants willing to expand and many companies
cutting back on space. Other tenants have delayed renewing their
leases because they have found that the longer they wait the more
rates decline and other incentives--such as free rent--increase.</LD>
<LD>   Even on the pricey and prestigious Westside, bargain hunters can
find space at monthly rates far below $3 a square foot in
high-profile neighborhoods such as Century City and Santa Monica,
said Howard Sadowsky, vice chairman of real estate brokerage Julien
J. Studley. "You didn't see that a year ago."</LD>
<TE>   At the end of the July-September quarter, the vacancy rate in Los
Angeles County and a small part of Ventura County stood at 17.23%, up
from 14.83% a year ago, according to real estate services firm
Insignia/ESG. The average monthly asking rent continued to edge
downward to $2.21, about 5% less than the same quarter last year.</TE>
<TE>   The deterioration in leasing and vacancy rates overshadowed a few
promising signs. The completion of an additional 500,000 square feet
of space during the third quarter did not have as big a negative
effect as some had expected. In addition, though the pool of space
available for lease continued to expand, it did so at a slower pace
and could actually start to decline early next year, said Kevin
Morrow, Western region research director for Insignia/ESG.</TE>
<TE>   "That does foretell an improvement in the Los Angeles office
market," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But other real estate brokers said the office market, which has
been on the decline for more than two years, still has a long way to
go before it stages a recovery. That turnaround will come only once
the economy begins to expand at a faster rate and companies add
workers, brokers said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no inherent growth and there is no particularly strong
industry sector," said broker Jerry Porter of Cresa Partners. "We
have no demand right now, and [companies] are still downsizing and
shedding space. I think it's going to get worse."</TE>
<TE>   Landlords have become more desperate in recent months as they
court the few tenants looking for space by offering increasingly
generous leasing and move-in packages, said Bob Healey, a broker with
CB Richard Ellis.</TE>
<TE>   Some landlords have cut rents 15% this year, but tenants, for the
most part, are not biting.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is just hunkered down right now," Healey said.</TE>

<HD>Mediation Begins; Pressure Grows</HD>
<DH>Labor: A union officer expresses optimism about a weekend
reopening, though no progress is reported on a key area of dispute.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The longshore union and shipping lines tried to hammer out their
differences with a federal mediator Thursday as losses from a West
Coast port shutdown continued to cascade through the economy.</LD>
<LD>   With about 150 container vessels stranded outside ports along the
coast, at least 18 others changed course to seek alternatives in
Mexico or elsewhere. Meanwhile, a growing number of Republican and
Democratic legislators weighed in on the standoff, with some calling
for the Bush administration to intervene and others warning that such
a move could be counterproductive.</LD>
<LD>   After five months of negotiations and escalating tensions,
Thursday's talks in San Francisco were described by both sides as
cordial, and one officer of the International Longshore and Warehouse
Union said there was a good chance that progress would allow the
ports to reopen this weekend.</LD>
<TE>   "The natural next step is to get people working again," said Peter
Peyton, a veteran longshore clerk who is in Washington to lobby
against federal intervention. "I think it will be soon."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the optimism, however, there was no apparent movement on
an issue that both sides consider crucial to their long-term
survival: whether several hundred key computer jobs will be brought
under the union's jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   Fed up with what they portray as an arrogant and overreaching
union, several members of the Pacific Maritime Assn., which
represents shipping lines and terminal operators, said they are
adamantly opposed to giving over a single additional job.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to determine the planning of all cargo. They want
programming and maintenance of computers. And there is no way in heck
we're going to agree to it," said one terminal operator executive who
asked not be named because he said he feared retribution from the
union.</TE>
<TE>   The union is equally adamant about representing cargo planners and
having exclusive control over cargo information once it arrives in
the terminal. Those jobs, union officers say, fall under the union's
traditional jurisdiction of "directing the flow of cargo" and are
seen as crucial to the union's future. "Without that," said one
marine clerk in Los Angeles, who spoke only on the condition that he
not be named, "I think our days are numbered."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, a group of House Republicans from California,
joined by at least one Democrat, signed a letter urging Bush to
invoke the Taft-Hartley Act, which would allow him to order the
reopening of the ports for an 80-day cooling-off period.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. President, the American people cannot sustain a long-term
lockout of California ports," wrote Reps. Doug Ose (R-Sacramento),
Darrell Issa (R-Vista), Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) and Cal Dooley
(D-Visalia).</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn. shut down all West Coast cargo ports
Sunday, saying work slowdowns by the union amounted to a "strike with
pay" and that it was cheaper to close the ports than to operate them
under those conditions. The association says it will reopen the ports
if the union agrees to a new contract or to extend the expired one,
which would give the operators assurances against slowdowns.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said the White House is
monitoring the situation. "The longer the strike goes on, the more
harm is done to labor," he said. "The longer the strike goes on, the
more harm is done to management. And the longer the strike goes on,
the more harm is done to the economy,"</TE>
<TE>   Separately, four California House Democrats--George Miller of
Martinez, Barbara Lee of Oakland, Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco and
Sam Farr of Oakland--urged the heads of the Pacific Maritime Assn.
and the ILWU to end the lockout on their own without federal
intervention.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, container ships laden with consumer products,
electronics, auto parts and agricultural supplies vital to the U.S.
economy continued to back up at many of the West Coast's 29
commercial ports. An idled container vessel can cost $25,000 a day or
more in fuel, crew wages, provisions, maintenance, insurance and loan
payments. If the ship is docked at a major port such as Los Angeles,
berthing fees can exceed $10,000 a day.</TE>
<TE>   Some carriers have been diverting vessels to other destinations to
unload cargo and free the ships for other work. The Marine Exchange
for the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach said that as of Thursday
carriers had diverted 18 to 20 vessels to Mexican ports, the Panama
Canal or back to the harbors where they were loaded.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Dick McKenna, deputy director of the exchange, said there
are increasing indications that shipping lines are canceling trips to
the West Coast. At least 150 cargo vessels were stranded at West
Coast ports, including 90 in the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach
and 22 at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   "We are beyond the pale," said Robin Lanier, director of the West
Coast Waterfront Coalition, which represents retailers and
manufacturers. "If we stopped the lockout today and labor worked at
full productivity, it would take weeks and weeks to process all those
ships."</TE>
<TE>   The delay is of critical importance to retailers and manufacturers
throughout the western United States that are dependent on waterborne
trade. Store inventories are shrinking, and some factories have
either suspended production or are planning to do so.</TE>
<TE>   With Asia as a major source of electronic components and gear, the
tech industry also stands to lose from a prolonged dockworker
lockout. Dell Corp., for example, imports computer monitors and other
parts from Asia. Nintendo Co. manufactures its GameCube and Game Boy
Advance consoles in Japan. And Microsoft Corp. makes its Xbox game
console in China.</TE>
<TE>   Electronics retailers are not reporting shortages of key products,
but that easily could change if the lockout extends into November.</TE>

<LD>Owens Corning, which filed for bankruptcy protection two years ago,
wants its biggest shareholders to give back a portion of $62 million
in stock dividends they received from 1996 through 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The company filed lawsuits asking for the payouts to be returned
by mutual fund managers and investors who got more than $100,000 in
stock dividends during the four-year period. The company said the
payments may be fraudulent because it was insolvent when it paid the
money.</LD>

<KH>TROUBLE ON THE WATERFRONT</KH>
<HD>Shutdown Is Intensifying Unions' Rift</HD>
<DH>Labor: Mechanics and dockworkers have been at odds over
which group should be repairing and maintaining equipment at the
ports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The shutdown of West Coast ports is not only wreaking economic
damage, it's also exacerbating a long-simmering dispute between
separate unions for dockworkers and waterfront mechanics that has
ripped apart union solidarity at the ports.</LD>
<LD>   It's a turf battle over which union's members should be fixing and
maintaining the cranes, containers and other gear at the ports. The
mechanics, represented by the International Assn. of Machinists, are
angry because they say the dockworkers union is taking over lucrative
jobs once held by IAM members.</LD>
<LD>   The mechanics see the trend worsening because they say the
International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which represents the
dockworkers, is pressing to win more of the machinists' work as part
of the stalled contract talks that led port operators to shut down 29
West Coast ports.</LD>
<TE>   The IAM says about 300 of its members' jobs already have been lost
to the other union in recent years, and that the machinists'
remaining 900 jobs at West Coast ports are in jeopardy. The unions'
dispute also is complicating negotiations between the dockworkers and
the port operators, represented by the Pacific Maritime Assn., the
IAM said.</TE>
<TE>   In protest, IAM members this week have been crossing picket lines
set up by dockworkers. The mechanics allege that they've been met
with harassment--and in at least one case, violence--from idled
dockworkers at several West Coast waterfronts.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been threatened on virtually every terminal in Oakland,"
said Don Crosatto, area director of IAM District 190 in Oakland. On
Tuesday, one mechanic in Oakland was punched in the jaw by a
dockworker as the mechanic drove away from the terminal, Crosatto
said.</TE>
<TE>   The ILWU defends its stance, saying its contracts have clearly
spelled out for more than two decades which repair and maintenance
jobs come under its purview. "We're not asking for their
[machinists'] jobs," said ILWU spokesman Steve Stallone. "Where they
are working, they have jurisdiction."</TE>
<TE>   As for the reported harassment of IAM workers this week, he said:
"How do I comment on an allegation when there's no proof other than
the allegation?"</TE>
<TE>   The battle is over some of the better-paying blue-collar jobs in
Southern California; annual salaries for experienced port mechanics
can range from $65,000 to more than $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Clay Davis, an IAM mechanic for 37 years who now works on cranes
at the Port of Long Beach, said he has been among those taunted by
dockworkers after being escorted across ILWU picket lines to and from
his job site.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very frustrating; we shouldn't be fighting each other,"
Davis said. But he said the ILWU's effort threatens his seniority and
benefits at a time when he's four years from retirement, and that he
told the dockworkers: " 'You guys are trying to steal my job. So why
should I honor your picket line?' "</TE>
<TE>   Davis works for Stevedoring Services of America, a privately held
port operator based in Seattle that's been a major target of ILWU
criticism. But SSA is sticking with the machinists.</TE>
<TE>   "The ILWU wants those jobs and we're not going to agree to that"
because "we have a contract with the IAM and we're going to respect
our obligations," said Andy McLauchlan, an SSA vice president.</TE>

<HD>CFO of Veritas Misstated Education</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.</DL>
<LD>For one chief financial officer, truth Thursday was not just his
company's name. It was his undoing.</LD>
<LD>   Veritas Software Corp. is headquartered in Silicon Valley and, in
Latin, veritas means truth. That didn't stop Kenneth Lonchar from
lying about having a master's degree in business administration from
nearby Stanford University.</LD>
<LD>   Veritas officials said a member of the board of directors had
received an unsolicited, outside e-mail that said Lonchar had lied
about his education. The company investigated and Lonchar was asked
to resign.</LD>
<TE>   "I regret this misstatement of my educational background," Lonchar
said in a statement released by the firm. He was not available for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear whether Lonchar attended Stanford at all, or whether
he received a degree elsewhere. A Veritas spokeswoman declined to
elaborate on Lonchar's education.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to limit the damage, Veritas Chief Executive Gary Bloom
hastily arranged a conference call.</TE>
<TE>   "This unfortunate situation has no bearing on our financial
situation nor on our internal controls," Bloom said, adding that he
is confident that second-quarter results certified by Lonchar are
accurate. The company had net income of $26 million, or 6 cents a
share, in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   But Bloom's efforts were for nought, as the company's shares
dropped as much as 20% before closing down $2.77 to $11.73 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts agreed that investors are shaken after scandals at
companies such as Enron Corp., where the ex-CFO is charged with
fraud, and Tyco International Ltd., where executives are charged with
looting more than $600 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Here you have a CFO who signed the certifications and was
inaccurate about his personal history; that casts some doubt on the
numbers they reported," said William Rutherford, who manages $25
million for Rutherford Capital Management in Portland, Ore.
"Everybody is skittish."</TE>
<TE>   In a note to clients, Merrill Lynch analyst Scott Phillips said:
"Our first concern is that the CFO's falsification of his educational
credentials could suggest the financials are suspect." The news of
Lonchar's resignation prompted Merrill to cut its rating on Veritas
to "neutral" from "buy."</TE>
<TE>   Veritas said any deceit appeared to be confined to Lonchar's
educational credentials. It stood by its forecasts for third-quarter
revenue of between $350 million and $370 million and earnings,
excluding a range of special accounting items, of 11 cents to 13
cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Lonchar joins a list of corporate personalities who have had
resume trouble. Ex-Salomon Smith Barney analyst Jack Grubman said he
attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology, when he in fact
studied at Boston College. And like Lonchar, Hong Kong dot-com
entrepreneur Richard Li falsely claimed to have earned a Stanford
degree.</TE>
<TE>   Veritas said Lonchar will be replaced on an acting basis by Chief
Administrative Officer Jay Jones. It will name a new CFO by the end
of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Bloom said Lonchar joined Veritas through a merger with OpenVision
in 1997--a time when both companies were small and internal corporate
controls such as background checks were handled informally.</TE>
<TE>   Lonchar won CFO Magazine's Excellence Award for Managing External
Stakeholders in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   During the conference call, Bloom said it was unlikely there would
be additional scrutiny of the company's accounting results, given
that Veritas recently completed a review as part of the Securities
and Exchange Commission requirement that top executives certify
results.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News and Reuters were used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>One World, Linked by Containers</HD>
<DH>Trade: Changes in shipping in the last three decades have
made the Western port shutdown an event of global scale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON and EVELYN IRITANI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When striking dockworkers paralyzed West Coast ports in 1971,
President Nixon waited three months to force them back to work. But
with cargo ships backed up from San Diego to Seattle, few expect
President Bush to take anywhere near that long to step in this time.</LD>
<LD>   What has changed in three decades is America's growing dependence
on the swift movement of goods across international borders, and the
starring role of West Coast ports in that transformation. Now the
nation's gateway for surging trade with the Pacific Rim, the West
Coast's ports handled 253 million revenue tons of cargo last year.
That's more than four times as much as those ports handled in 1970.
Container volume has jumped twentyfold.</LD>
<LD>   Self-sufficient in just about everything but oil in the 1970s, the
United States has since embraced global commerce with a vengeance.
Stop the merchandise at the water's edge now, and repercussions
ripple around the world. California broccoli bound for Japan withers
on the docks. Honduran sewing machine operators sit idle waiting for
material to arrive from a Los Angeles factory. Chinese manufacturers
can't retrieve the ocean shipping containers they need to send shoes
and televisions to the United States.</LD>
<TE>   "Thirty years ago, when we had a dock closure, foreign trade
didn't matter to our economy. It was trivial," said economist Stephen
Cohen, co-director of the Berkeley Roundtable on the International
Economy. "It's quite different now. It's an integrated system, and if
you cut the supply line, you stop the system."</TE>
<TE>   Cost cutting has driven U.S. firms to embrace "just-in-time"
practices in a bid to eliminate every spare minute and wasted dollar
moving products from assembly lines to store shelves. That means
slashing inventories in favor of taking spot deliveries of goods only
as they are needed.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to falling trade barriers, smart communications technology
and cheap ocean shipping, suppliers today are much more likely to be
overseas than they were in the early 1970s. Autos, for example, once
a mainstay of U.S. industrial might, now arrive by the shipload from
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it's consumer goods, toys or more valuable articles,
nearly everything has moved overseas in the past 30 years," said
Robert Kleist, a 55-year-veteran of the shipping industry and advisor
to Taiwan-based Evergreen Shipping Lines. "It's to the point where
every citizen of the United States has become much more dependent on
international business, even though they don't think about it very
much."</TE>
<TE>   Inexpensive imported consumer goods have helped tame inflation,
while American companies have boosted their profits by eliminating
warehouses and outsourcing manufacturing to low-wage countries. No
less a luminary than Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has
credited this supply chain revolution with boosting U.S. productivity
and fueling the 1990s expansion.</TE>
<TE>   But the current labor strife at the West Coast ports illustrates
the inherent vulnerability of this system. A major bottleneck can
cripple some operations within days, as evidenced by Wednesday
night's shutdown of the Fremont, Calif., auto assembly plant owned by
Toyota Motor Corp. and General Motors Corp., which ran out of
imported parts less than a week after the management lockout began.</TE>
<TE>   Pickups and sedans are just the beginning. A lengthy shutdown of
the ports would wallop U.S. retailers, who depend on foreign
suppliers to stock their shelves with everything from apparel to
yo-yos. California, the nation's largest exporter, risks losing
foreign customers for its wine, almonds and high-tech equipment. The
West Coast lockout has made front-page news in Asia, whose economic
fate rests largely on its exports to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   What was an isolated spat between port management and the unions
in 1971 now strikes a vast web of interconnected players. Thus the
urgency to get the ports back up running--and fast.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like dominoes," said Guy Fox, an executive vice president
with the Redondo Beach office of Global Transportation Services Inc.
"Once one thing happens, it all starts to fall apart."</TE>
<TE>   In the chicken-and-egg history of globalization, it's hard to
pinpoint a single factor that has spawned the far-flung trading
networks we take for granted today. But logistics experts say you
couldn't do better than the humble shipping container, those huge
metal crates that allow cargo to be stacked as neatly as shoeboxes on
a shelf.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1970s, "containerization" was still a novelty and
seaborne cargo was still mostly handled in what was called "break
bulk" style. That meant that individual pieces of cargo had to be
carefully arranged in the hold of a ship, much like furniture inside
a moving truck. The process was labor-intensive, slow and costly. A
single ship could take as long as two weeks to load or unload.</TE>
<TE>   "Businesses couldn't afford to ship cheap products because rates
were just too expensive," said Robert Dockendorff, vice president of
research for the Pacific Maritime Assn., the San Francisco-based
employers group involved in the standoff with unionized dockworkers.
"It's one of the reasons why international trade wasn't a big factor
back then. But containerization changed everything."</TE>
<TE>   Containers packed at the factory or farm can be whisked to ports
via rail or truck and loaded directly onto ships by giant, high-tech
cranes. That efficiency helped dramatically lower shipping rates.
Carriers launched a new generation of mega-ships, some the length of
four football fields, to handle burgeoning trade with Asia. Major
West Coast ports responded by investing billions of dollars in deep
harbors, cranes and transportation links to move containers
seamlessly to trucks and trains, outpacing their East Coast
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Those investments have paid off as the value of waterborne trade
through West Coast ports reached $309 billion in 2000, a 400%
increase since 1980. More than three-quarters of all containerized
products on the West Coast are shipped through the ports of Long
Beach, Los Angeles and Oakland alone.</TE>
<TE>   The bad news for logistics specialists now trying to work around
the West Coast port closures is that this specialized infrastructure
is difficult to replicate. In most cases, there is no alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Many modern cargo ships are too big to squeeze through the Panama
Canal, and the western ports of Mexico and Canada are ill-equipped to
handle extra traffic. Shipping by air is costly.</TE>
<TE>   Not yet a week old, the port shutdown is already taking a toll on
the apparel industry, whose far-reaching global supply chains depend
on ocean shipping. It's not unusual for a single garment to hopscotch
across two or three countries on its way to retail shelves. Those
logistics, complicated under any circumstances, just got worse for
Los Angeles apparel maker Vera Campbell.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to ship fabric from her Los Angeles facility to her sewing
plant in Honduras via the ports of Long Beach or Los Angeles,
Campbell is arranging to truck it to New Orleans and load it on a
ship there. The trucking charges and other extras will add nearly a
nickel to the price of each garment, big money in an industry with
razor-thin profit margins. Even worse is the loss of precious time
during the crucial holiday shipping season.</TE>
<TE>   "The apparel business is horrible right now, and retailers are
looking for any excuse to cancel orders," said Campbell, whose
company, Knit Works, makes juniors and children's knitwear. "If you
blow a deadline, that's what will happen. They won't care that it was
because of a dock [shutdown]."</TE>
<TE>   Calculating the collective economic fallout is impossible because
the effects are so broad and unpredictable, hitting different parts
of the economy with varying speed. But many economists agree that the
damage already totals in the billions of dollars and would rise
quickly if the shutdown were to extend beyond a week.</TE>
<TE>   Extensive losses could take a toll on an already weakened U.S.
economy and throw a monkey wrench in a global recovery that's highly
dependent on U.S. spending. That's of particular concern to
trade-dependent Asian economies.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not what you want when you have so many uncertainties
facing business," said Connie Bolland, an economist based in Hong
Kong, where the government is counting on U.S. consumers to pull its
economy out of recession. "There's a war possibly starting up in
Iraq; the business recovery is stalling at the moment. These are
tough times. This just adds to their business costs."</TE>
<TE>   Back in the United States, the clock is ticking for Larry Rinaldi,
president of Aico, a Santa Fe Springs furniture importer. With just
two weeks left before the nation's biggest furniture show opens in
High Point, N.C., his newest collections are bobbing in four
containers somewhere off the Southern California coast. If he can't
get his hands on those dining room and bedroom sets by next week, he
could be left with an empty space on the showroom floor. What's
worse, the goods he will need to fill orders are stuck in hundreds of
containers making their way across the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Three decades ago, domestic furniture makers barely noticed the
lengthy port strike because they produced and sold almost everything
within the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Today, foreign-made products represent almost half of U.S.
furniture sales, and it is tough to find an American furniture firm
that doesn't import at least some components from Asia. Like Aico,
many of those firms have goods caught somewhere in the pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the port lockdown is resolved soon, there still would be
lengthy delays on the waterfront as the backed-up cargo works its way
through a system that has been thrown into disarray.</TE>
<TE>   "We pray for a quick solution," Rinaldi said. " ... I don't think
anybody wins on this."</TE>

<HD>Israeli Troops Conducting Drills Aimed at Forced Exile of
Arafat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli troops are practicing bundling Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat into a helicopter and whisking him into
exile, a drill that underscores Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's
determination to get rid of his longtime nemesis.</LD>
<LD>   Thus far, Sharon has been restrained by opposition from his
security advisors and political pressure from the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
troops who would carry out an order to expel Arafat have been placed
on standby three times in recent months, including after a Passover
suicide attack that killed 29 people in March and triggered a major
Israeli offensive against Palestinian militants.</LD>
<TE>   The daily Maariv said that as part of the preparations, commandos
scouted locations where Arafat could be sent. It did not name the
country, but Israeli television has reported that Libya was chosen
for his exile.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon spokesman Raanan Gissin declined to comment on the report.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer and security officials,
including the heads of the Mossad and Shin Bet spy agencies, have
argued against Arafat's expulsion, saying he is confined and isolated
and would cause greater problems for Israel if he were abroad,
jetting among capitals to promote the Palestinian quest for
statehood.</TE>

<HD>War on Terrorism Stirs Anger of Pakistani Tribe</HD>
<DH>Asia: Those living near the Afghan border resent the U.S.
for helping direct the hunt for Al Qaeda and Taliban holdouts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HASSANI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Hidden from the outside world, an escalating war against terrorism in
the wild badlands of northwestern Pakistan is feeding a seething
anger, and many here are talking of new scores to settle with the
United States.</LD>
<LD>   The hunt for suspected Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters in the
Pushtun tribal areas bordering Afghanistan has turned violent several
times during the last few months. Recently, Pakistani police blew up
five ethnic Pushtun villagers' homes as punishment for refusing to
cooperate with the U.S.-declared war against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Several thousand Pakistani soldiers and paramilitary police, said
to be working with U.S. military advisors, are mounting
search-and-destroy operations in rugged areas where Pushtun tribesmen
bitterly resent outside interference.</LD>
<TE>   Any mistakes made now risk creating a new generation of
anti-American hatred in a region that has long been a breeding ground
for terrorism against the West and India, Pakistan's neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   "We welcomed the Pakistan army, but now, when people suspect
American advisors are with them, feelings are turned against them,"
said Maulana Mir Kalam, 50, a Pushtun religious leader from the
village of Datta Khel, on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that all of Pakistan is our home, and we cannot tolerate
having American troops searching our homes and areas."</TE>
<TE>   The Pakistani government says it has arrested 422 Al Qaeda members
crossing from Afghanistan so far, but scores more are believed to
have eluded capture. Former Taliban government ministers and other
officials have been seen residing, and making speeches, in Pakistan's
refugee camps. A militant underground is still thriving.</TE>
<TE>   A former Taliban diplomat summoned four Pakistani journalists
Sept. 27 to a secret location in Peshawar, the capital of North-West
Frontier Province, and said he had recently met with Taliban leader
Mullah Mohammed Omar in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Naseer Ahmed Roohi, who was first secretary at the Taliban's
embassy in the United Arab Emirates, said he saw Omar in Afghanistan
more than two weeks earlier to receive instructions from him. Roohi
also claimed that 5,000 Taliban members and supporters were waging a
guerrilla war against U.S. forces and their Afghan allies.</TE>
<TE>   The Pushtuns here have resisted central authority, and outside
intervention, for centuries, and many see the U.S. as the latest in a
long line of foreign powers that have tried, and failed, to conquer
them.</TE>
<TE>   They live by a centuries-old code of honor called pushtunwali. It
allows a Pushtun only one way to restore his honor and self-respect
in the face of an insult or injury: He must exact revenge. And if
death comes first, his surviving relatives are bound to seek
vengeance for him.</TE>
<TE>   The first U.S. soldier killed by enemy fire in Afghanistan, Sgt.
1st Class Nathan Ross Chapman, was shot in January by a 14-year-old
boy as payback for the death of his father in a bombing raid, Pushtun
elders in the eastern city of Khowst said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Just across the border in Pakistan's tribal areas, U.S. troops are
providing what is officially called "technical assistance" to
Pakistani forces. Both governments refuse to say how many U.S.
soldiers, or civilian agents, are operating in northwestern Pakistan
or what they are doing here.</TE>
<TE>   A Pakistani intelligence official said several FBI agents work out
of the U.S. Consulate in Peshawar and go into the tribal regions only
on special missions.</TE>
<TE>   But the common belief among Pushtuns is that Americans are
directing Pakistani forces to attack their own countrymen. Right or
wrong, that view is strengthening support for the Taliban and Al
Qaeda in a region the U.S. military sees as a rear base for the
radical Islamic fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Islamic radicals in madrasas, or religious schools, are resisting
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf's reform efforts, and some have
become rallying points for extremists as they regroup. Angry rhetoric
against the war on terrorism is escalating in the madrasas, including
the one where American John Walker Lindh studied the Koran for six
months before joining the Taliban in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a war, this is a cancer--for the entire world," said
Mufti Mohammed Iltamas, 33, a staunch Taliban supporter who taught
Lindh here in this village.</TE>
<TE>   At least three U.S. soldiers in uniform are advising Pakistani
forces from a base in a former vocational school compound in the town
of Miran Shah, in the North Waziristan tribal region, according to
local journalist Al-Haj Mohammed Paxir Gul, correspondent for Dawn,
one of Pakistan's leading English-language dailies.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. soldiers decide where to look for suspected Taliban and
Al Qaeda fighters, and then Pakistani troops carry out the searches,
or deal with any resistance, Gul said.</TE>
<TE>   Gul, who lives in Miran Shah, claimed that three Americans acted
as advisors in a two-hour search operation at Dhanday Darpakhel, near
the Miran Shah bazaar. The operation turned up nothing, and only one
shot was fired, accidentally, by a Pakistani soldier, according to
Gul.</TE>
<TE>   A local official in the tribal agency that administers the area
confirmed that a few Americans are still based at the vocational
school. But they are working in civilian clothes and spend most of
their time in the heavily guarded compound acting as "technical
experts," said the official, who spoke on condition that he not be
named because of the secrecy of the mission.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the U.S. operations in Pakistan, a spokesman for the
U.S. Central Command said: "I do not have a word of anything on that
for you. Nothing at all on that issue."</TE>
<TE>   One of the most recent clashes between Pakistani security forces
and Pushtun tribesmen occurred in the village of Jani Khel early last
month after the troops arrested six suspected Al Qaeda fighters and a
mob of as many as 60 armed villagers grabbed them back.</TE>
<TE>   Some reports said authorities believe that the men arrested Sept.
2 were Chechens or Indonesians. But Kalam, a member of North
Waziristan's tribal jirga, or traditional council, insisted that they
were local men who had no links to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Local elders later returned to a checkpoint with six men, but not
the ones the security forces said they had originally arrested,
according to Kalam. Hundreds of troops laid siege to the village, and
the tribesmen threatened an uprising.</TE>
<TE>   To end the standoff, the tribal region's administration invoked
the draconian Frontier Crimes Regulation, which British colonial
rulers imposed in 1901 when Pakistan was still part of India and
ruled by the British raj. It permits collective punishment and
imprisonment without trial.</TE>
<TE>   When the security forces could finally search the village, the
suspects were gone. Authorities ordered the demolition of five houses
that were home to about 50 people in the impoverished village of
about 300 families.</TE>
<TE>   Kalam said the local jirga reluctantly approved the destruction of
the houses, not because council members agreed that the owners were
guilty of harboring terrorists but simply to make peace with the
government.</TE>
<TE>   The families whose houses were destroyed will eventually rebuild
them, the maulana said, but no Pushtun or Muslim can forget the
cruelty they have suffered, Kalam said.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating the search operations is a suspicion, expressed
privately by some U.S. diplomats and more openly by Afghan officials,
that elements of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency, or
ISI, may be secretly aiding Taliban and Al Qaeda holdouts.</TE>
<TE>   During a visit to Iltamas' madrasa, it was obvious that the ISI is
still on good terms with some well-known Taliban supporters. A
reporter inquired about the mufti's interrogation in May by four FBI
agents interested in Lindh's stay at the school, and Iltamas
immediately got up and made a whispered phone call. Minutes later,
two men walked into the room, sat down on the floor and carefully
monitored the rest of the interview. At all times, the mufti deferred
to the men, who spoke to him like helpful advisors rather than
adversaries. They later identified themselves as ISI agents.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan Interior Ministry, intelligence and military officials
have repeatedly accused the ISI of secretly continuing its support
for the Taliban to wage a guerrilla war in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   .</TE>
<TE>   "They do it through their Afghan mercenaries," charged Afghan army
Brig. Gen. Mohammed Eisa Shahzadah, an ethnic Pushtun who controls
troops in the region east of Kabul, the capital, toward the Pakistan
border. "This is Pakistan foreign policy that only the ISI knows
about. Of course, it is unofficial and hidden."</TE>
<TE>   Zahidur Rehman, who recruits guerrilla fighters for the jihad
against Indian security forces in the disputed territory of Kashmir,
said it is possible that elements of the Pakistani military are
aiding the Taliban against orders.</TE>
<TE>   "In name, the [Pakistani] army commanders are Muslims but not
practicing ones," Rehman said in the village of Mitha Khel, also in
North-West Frontier Province. "The soldiers up to the rank of major
are real Muslims, particularly Pushtuns. They have sympathy for the
Taliban and Al Qaeda."</TE>
<TE>   The majority of Pakistan's Pushtuns share that feeling and oppose
U.S. actions in Afghanistan, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Koran teaches that whenever someone comes and attacks your
house, which can be taken as your nation or all of Islam, it is your
duty to defend yourself, to take up arms against the invaders,"
Rehman said.</TE>
<TE>   "America, which considers itself a peaceful country, works to
establish its hegemony over the entire world," Kalam said. "But being
Muslims, our prophet has taught us that such people--these
infidels--are also human beings.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe in the hereafter, and that these infidels must not go
to hell. So we invite them to convert to Islam so that they might be
spared eternal damnation. We just want all of humanity to embrace
Islam so that they may live happily in the afterlife."</TE>

<LD>U.S. special forces will begin training a new Colombian army commando
unit this month to attack outlawed armed groups, U.S. officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. officials insisted that the training is part of the war
on drugs. Both nations consider all three of Colombia's outlawed
armed groups--two leftist rebel armies and a right-wing paramilitary
outfit--drug-trafficking organizations. Rebels and their paramilitary
foes "tax" drug crops, earning huge profits.</LD>

<LD>Turkey formally commuted Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan's
death sentence to life in prison, two months after parliament
abolished capital punishment in the nation's bid to join the European
Union.</LD>
<LD>   A court in Ankara, the capital, ruled that Ocalan, head of the
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, was covered by the August reforms,
the semiofficial Anatolian news agency reported. Ocalan was sentenced
to death for treason in 1999 for leading the PKK's 15-year war for
autonomy in mostly Kurdish southeastern Turkey.</LD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From the top of his rolling freight car, Enrique sees a figure of
Christ.</LD>
<LD>   In the fields of Veracruz state, among farmers and their donkeys
piled with sugar cane, rises a mountain. It towers over the train he
is riding. At the summit stands a statue of Jesus. It is 60 feet
tall, dressed in white, with a pink tunic.</LD>
<LD>   The statue stretches out both arms. They reach toward Enrique and
his fellow wayfarers on top of their rolling freight cars.</LD>
<TE>   Some stare silently. Others whisper a prayer.</TE>
<TE>   It is early April 2000, and they have made it nearly a third of
the way up the length of Mexico, a handful of immigrants, riding on
boxcars, tank cars and hoppers. Enrique is 17. He is one of an
estimated 48,000 Central American and Mexican children who go to the
United States alone every year. Many are searching for their mothers,
who have left for El Norte to find work and never come back.</TE>
<TE>   Many credit religious faith for their progress. They pray on top
of the train cars. At stops, they kneel along the tracks, asking God
for help and guidance. They ask him to keep them alive until they
reach El Norte. They ask him to protect them against bandits, who rob
and beat them; police, who shake them down; and la migra, the Mexican
immigration authorities, who deport them.</TE>
<TE>   Many carry small Bibles, wrapped in plastic bags to keep them dry.
On the pages, in the margins, they scrawl the names and addresses of
the people who help them. The police often check the bindings for
money to steal, the migrants say, but usually hand the Bibles back.</TE>
<TE>   Some pages are particularly worn. The one that offers the 23rd
Psalm, for instance: "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod
and thy staff they comfort me."</TE>
<TE>   Or the 91st Psalm: "There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall
any plague come nigh thy dwelling. For he shall give his angels
charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways."</TE>
<TE>   Some migrants rely on a special prayer, "La Oracion a las Tres
Divinas Personas"--a prayer to the Holy Trinity. It has seven
sentences--short enough to recite in a moment of danger. If they rush
the words, God will not mind.</TE>
<TE>   That night, Enrique climbs to the top of a boxcar. In the
starlight, he sees a man on his knees, bending over his Bible,
praying.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique climbs back down.</TE>
<TE>   He does not turn to God for help. With all the sins he has
committed, he thinks he has no right to ask God for anything.</TE>
<TE>   SMALL BUNDLES</TE>
<TE>   What he receives are gifts.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique expects the worst. Riding trains through the state of
Chiapas, which immigrants call "the beast," has taught him that any
upraised hand might hurl a stone. But here in the states of Oaxaca
and Veracruz, he discovers that people are friendly. "It's just the
way we are," says Jorge Zarif Zetuna Curioca, a legislator from
Ixtepec.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps not everyone is that way, but there is a widespread
generosity of spirit. Many residents say it is rooted in the Zapotec
and Mixtec indigenous cultures. Besides, some say, giving is a good
way to protest Mexico's policies against illegal immigration.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after seeing the statue of Jesus, Enrique is alone on a
hopper. Night has fallen, and as the train passes through a tiny
town, it blows its soulful horn. He looks over the side. More than a
dozen people, mostly women and children, are rushing out of their
houses along the tracks, clutching small bundles.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the migrants grow afraid. Will these people throw rocks?
They lie low on top of the train. Enrique sees a woman and a boy run
up alongside his hopper</TE>
<TE>   "Orale, chavo! Here, boy!" they shout.</TE>
<TE>   They toss up a roll of crackers. It is the first gift.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique reaches out. He grabs with one hand, but holds tightly to
the hopper with the other. The roll of crackers flies several feet
away, bounces off the car and thumps to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Now women and children on both sides of the tracks are throwing
bundles to the immigrants on the tops of the cars. They run quickly
and aim carefully, mostly in silence, trying hard not to miss.</TE>
<TE>   "Alli va uno! There's one!"</TE>
<TE>   Enrique looks down. There are the same woman and boy. They are
heaving a blue plastic bag. This time the bundle lands squarely in
his arms.</TE>
<TE>   "Gracias! Adios!" he says into the darkness. He isn't sure the
strangers, who pass by in a flash, even heard him.</TE>
<TE>   He opens the bag. Inside are half a dozen rolls of bread.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique is stunned by the generosity. In many places where the
train slows in Veracruz, at a curve or to pass through a village,
people give. Sometimes 20 or 30 people stream out of their homes
along the rails and toward the train. They smile, then shout and
throw food.</TE>
<TE>   The towns of Encinar, Fortin de las Flores, Cuichapa and Presidio
are particularly known for their kindness. These are unlikely places
for people to be giving food to strangers. A World Bank study in 2000
found that 42.5% of Mexico's 100 million people live on $2 or less a
day. Here, in rural areas, 30% of children 5 and younger eat so
little that their growth is stunted, and the people who live in
humble houses along the rails are often the poorest.</TE>
<TE>   Families throw sweaters, tortillas, bread and plastic bottles
filled with lemonade. A baker, his hands coated with flour, throws
his extra loaves. A seamstress throws bags filled with sandwiches. A
teenager throws bananas. A store owner throws animal crackers,
day-old pastries and half-liter bottles of water.</TE>
<TE>   A young man, Leovardo Santiago Flores, throws oranges in November,
when they are plentiful, and watermelons and pineapples in July. A
stooped woman, Maria Luisa Mora Martin, more than 100 years old, who
was reduced to eating the bark of her plantain tree during the
Mexican Revolution, forces her knotted hands to fill bags with
tortillas, beans and salsa so her daughter, Soledad Vasquez, 70, can
run down a rocky slope and heave them onto a train.</TE>
<TE>   "If I have one tortilla, I give half away," one of the food
throwers says. "I know God will bring me more."</TE>
<TE>   Another: "I don't like to feel that I have eaten and they
haven't."</TE>
<TE>   Still others: "When you see these people, it moves you. It moves
you. Can you imagine how far they've come?"</TE>
<TE>   "God says, when I saw you naked, I clothed you. When I saw you
hungry, I gave you food. That is what God teaches."</TE>
<TE>   "It feels good to give something that they need so badly."</TE>
<TE>   "I figure when I die, I can't take anything with me. So why not
give?"</TE>
<TE>   "What if someday something bad happens to us? Maybe someone will
extend a hand to us."</TE>
<TE>   NEW CARGO</TE>
<TE>   Enrique is hungry, but he fears that the half-dozen rolls from the
food throwers might be all there is to his good fortune, so he
stashes them for later.</TE>
<TE>   In little more than an hour, the train nears a town: Cordoba.</TE>
<TE>   The cargo is beginning to change. It is valuable and more easily
damaged--Volkswagens, Fords and Chryslers. Security guards check the
freight cars, catch every rider they can and hand them over to
authorities. More important, says Cuauhtemoc Gonzalez Flores, an
official of the Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana railroad, if a
migrant falls and is injured or killed, it costs $8 a minute to stop
the train, often for hours, until investigators arrive.</TE>
<TE>   A sewage stream appears by the tracks. Cordoba is getting close.
The immigrants finish their water, because it is hard to run fast
holding bottles. They tie sweaters or extra shirts around their
waists. Enrique grabs his bag of bread. About 10 p.m., he smells a
familiar cue: a coffee-roasting factory next to the red brick
station. As the train slows, he leaps and flees.</TE>
<TE>   He sits on a sidewalk one block north of the station. Two police
officers approach.</TE>
<TE>   His odds are better if he does not bolt. He tucks his bread into a
crevice. He swallows his fright and tries to look unconcerned.</TE>
<TE>   The officers, in navy blue uniforms, walk straight up to him.</TE>
<TE>   He does not move, even flinch. Cops can sense fear. They can tell
if someone is illegal. You have to be calm, he says to himself. You
can't look afraid or hide. You have to look right at them.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike food throwers, the police do not bear gifts. They pull out
pistols.</TE>
<TE>   "If you run, I'll shoot you," one says, aiming at Enrique's chest.</TE>
<TE>   They take him and two younger boys, sitting nearby, to a cavernous
railroad shed, where seven other officers are holding 20 migrants.</TE>
<TE>   It is a full-scale sweep.</TE>
<TE>   They line up the immigrants against a wall. "Take everything out
of your pockets."</TE>
<TE>   Only a bribe, Enrique knows, will keep him from being deported
back to Central America. He has 30 pesos, about $3, that he earned
lifting rocks and sweeping near the tracks in Tierra Blanca. He prays
it will be enough.</TE>
<TE>   One officer pats him down and says to empty his pockets.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique drops his belt, a Raiders cap and the 30 pesos. He glances
at his fellow migrants. Each is standing behind a little pile of
belongings.</TE>
<TE>   "Salganse! Vayanse, ya! Get out! Leave!"</TE>
<TE>   He will not be deported. But he pauses. He screws up his courage.
"Can I get my things back, my money?"</TE>
<TE>   "What money?" the officer replies. "Forget about it, unless you
want to have your trip stop here."</TE>
<TE>   Enrique turns his back and walks away.</TE>
<TE>   Even in Veracruz, where strangers can be so kind, the authorities
cannot be trusted. The chief of state police in nearby Fortin de las
Flores will not comment on the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Exhausted, Enrique retrieves his bag of bread, climbs
onto a flatbed truck and sleeps. At dawn, he hears a train. He trots
alongside a freight car and clambers aboard, holding his bread.</TE>
<TE>   THE MOUNTAINS</TE>
<TE>   The tracks, smoother now, begin to climb. It grows cooler. The
train passes 60-foot stalks of bamboo. It rolls through putrid white
smoke from a Kimberly-Clark factory that turns sugar cane pulp into
Kleenex and toilet paper.</TE>
<TE>   In Orizaba, the train changes crews. Enrique asks a man standing
near the tracks, "Can you give me one peso to buy some food?" The man
inquires about his scars. They are from a beating little more than a
week ago on top of a train. He gives Enrique 15 pesos, about $1.50.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique runs to buy soda and cheese to go with his bread. He looks
north and sees snow-covered Pico de Orizaba, the highest summit in
Mexico. Now it will turn icy cold, especially at night, much
different from the steamy lowlands. Enrique begs two sweaters. Before
the train pulls out, he runs from car to car, looking into the
hollows at the ends of the hoppers, where riders occasionally discard
clothing. In one, he finds a blanket.</TE>
<TE>   As the train starts, Enrique shares his cheese, soda and rolls
with two other boys, also headed for the United States. One is 13.
The other is 17. Silently, Enrique thanks the food throwers again for
the bread.</TE>
<TE>   He relishes the camaraderie: how riders take care of one another,
pass along what they know, divide what they have. Camaraderie often
means survival. "I could get to the north faster alone," he figures,
"but I might not make it."</TE>
<TE>   The mountains close in. Enrique invites the two boys to share his
blanket. Together they will be warmer. The three jam themselves
between a grate and an opening on top of a hopper. Enrique stuffs
rags under his head for a pillow. The car sways, and its wheels
click-clack quietly. They sleep.</TE>
<TE>   The train enters a tunnel, the first of 32 in the Cumbres de
Acultzingo, or the Peaks of Acultzingo. Outside is bright sun. Inside
is darkness so black that riders cannot see their hands. They shout,
"Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!" and listen for the echo. Enrique and his
friends sleep on. Back in the daylight, the train hugs a hillside.
Below, a valley is filled with fields of corn, radishes and lettuce,
each a different hue of green.</TE>
<TE>   El Mexicano is the longest tunnel. For eight minutes, the train
vanishes inside. Black diesel smoke hugs the tops of the cars. It
burns the lungs and stings the eyes. Enrique's eyes are closed, but
his face and arms turn gray. His nose runs black soot. Engineers fear
El Mexicano. If a locomotive overheats, they must stop. Riders spring
for the arched exits, gasping for clean air.</TE>
<TE>   Back outside, ice forms on the cars. Riders ache and shiver. Their
lips crack, and their eyes grow dull. They hug themselves. They pull
their shirts over their mouths to warm themselves with their breath.
When the train slows, they jog alongside to ward off the cold. As
night falls, some of the older immigrants drink whiskey. Too much and
they tumble off. Others gather old clothing and trash and build fires
on the ledges over the wheels of the hoppers. Some stand in the warm
plumes of diesel smoke.</TE>
<TE>   At dawn, the tracks straighten and level out. At 1 1/2 miles above
sea level, the train accelerates to 35 mph. Enrique awakens. He sees
cultivated cactus on both sides. Directly in front rise two huge
pyramids, the Aztec metropolis of Teotihuacan.</TE>
<TE>   Then he sees switches and semaphores. Housing developments. A
billboard for Paradise Spa. A sewage ditch. Taxis.</TE>
<TE>   The train slows for the station at Lecheria. Enrique gets ready to
run.</TE>
<TE>   He is in Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   SUSPICION</TE>
<TE>   The Veracruz hospitality has vanished.</TE>
<TE>   One woman wrinkles her nose when she talks about migrants. She is
hesitant to slide the deadbolt on the metal door of her tall stucco
fence. "I'm afraid of them. They talk funny. They are dirty."</TE>
<TE>   Enrique starts knocking on doors. He begs for food. In Mexico
City, where crime is rampant, people are often hostile. "We don't
have anything," they say at house after house, usually through locked
doors.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, at one house, another gift: A woman offers him tortillas,
beans and lemonade.</TE>
<TE>   Now he must hide from the state police, who guard the depot at
Lecheria, a gritty industrial neighborhood on the northwestern
outskirts of Mexico City. He crawls into a 3-foot-wide concrete
culvert.</TE>
<TE>   At 10:30 p.m., a northbound train arrives. From Mexico City
onward, the rail system is more modern, and trains run so fast that
few immigrants ride on top. Enrique and his two friends pick an open
boxcar. If they are caught inside, it will be hard to escape, but
they count on the scarcity of migra checkpoints in northern Mexico.
The boys load cardboard to lie on and stay clean.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique notices a blanket on a nearby hopper. He climbs a ladder
to get it and hears a loud buzz from overhead. Live wires carry
electricity above the trains for 143 miles north. Once used for
locomotives that no longer operate, the wires still carry 25,000
volts to prevent vandalism. Signs warn: "Danger--High Voltage." But
many of the migrants cannot read.</TE>
<TE>   They do not even need to touch the lines to be killed. The
electricity arcs up to 20 inches. Only 36 inches separate the wires
from the tallest freight cars, the auto carriers. In railroad offices
in Mexico City, computers plot train routes with blue and green
lines, and at least once every six months the screens flicker, then
black out. An immigrant has crawled on top of a car, been hit by
electricity and short-circuited the system. When the computers
reboot, the screens flash red where it happened.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique climbs the hopper car. Carefully, he snatches a corner of
the blanket and yanks it down. Then he scrambles back to his boxcar
and settles into a bed that he and his friends have fashioned out of
straw they found inside.</TE>
<TE>   The boys share a bottle of water and one of juice. They plow
through a heavy fog, and Enrique sleeps soundly--too soundly.</TE>
<TE>   He does not sense when police stop their train in the middle of
the central Mexican desert. Officers dressed in black find the boys
curled under their blanket in the straw. They take them to their
jefe, who is cooking a pot of stew over a campfire. He pats them down
to check for drugs. Then, instead of arresting them, he gives all
three tortillas and water--and toothpaste to clean up.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique is astonished. The jefe lets them re-board the boxcar and
tells them to get off the train before San Luis Potosi, where 64
railroad security officers guard the station. At midmorning, Enrique
sees two flashing red antennas. The boys jump off the train half a
mile south of town.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, Enrique has opted to keep moving. But here the
countryside is too desolate to live off the land, and begging is too
chancy. He needs to work if he is going to survive. Besides, he does
not want to reach the border penniless. He has heard that U.S.
ranchers shoot immigrants who come to beg.</TE>
<TE>   He trudges up a hill to the small home of a brick maker. Politely,
Enrique asks for food. The brick maker offers yet another kindness:
If Enrique will work, he will get both food and a place to sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Happily, Enrique accepts.</TE>
<TE>   Some migrants say Mexicans exploit illegals for a fraction of the
going wage, which is 50 pesos, or about $5, a day. But the brick
maker does better than that: 80 pesos. And he gives Enrique shoes and
clothing.</TE>
<TE>   For a day and a half, Enrique works at the brickyard, one of 300
that straddle the tracks on the northern edge of San Luis Potosi.
Workers pour clay, water and dried cow manure into large pits. They
roll up their pants and stomp on the sloppy concoction, as if
pressing grapes to make wine. When the slop becomes a firm brown
paste, they slap it into wooden molds. Then they empty the molds on
flat ground and let the bricks dry.</TE>
<TE>   The bricks are stacked into pyramids inside ovens as big as rooms.
Under the ovens, the fires are stoked with sawdust. Each batch of
bricks bakes for 15 hours, sending clouds of black smoke into the
sky.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique's job is to shovel the clay. At night, he sleeps in a shed
on a dirt floor he shares with one of his friends from the train.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to get to the border," Enrique tells him.</TE>
<TE>   Should he take another train? Freight cars have brought him 990
miles from Tapachula near Guatemala. Is he pushing his luck?</TE>
<TE>   His employer says he should ride a Volkswagen van called a combi
through a checkpoint about 40 minutes north of town. The authorities
won't stop a combi, the brick maker says. Then he should take a bus
to Matehuala, and he might be able to get a ride on a truck all the
way to Nuevo Laredo on the Rio Grande.</TE>
<TE>   THE TRUCKER</TE>
<TE>   Enrique collects his pay, 120 pesos. He spends a few on a
toothbrush.</TE>
<TE>   He hails a combi. It breezes through the checkpoint. He pays 83
pesos to board a bus to Matehuala. Outside the bus station, he sees a
kindly looking man.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you help me?" Enrique asks.</TE>
<TE>   The man gives him a place to sleep. The next morning, Enrique
walks to a truck stop.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any money," he tells every driver he sees. "Can you
give me a ride however far north you are going?"</TE>
<TE>   One after another, they turn him down. If they said yes, police
might accuse them of smuggling. Drivers say it is enough to worry
about officers planting drugs on their trucks and demanding bribes.
Moreover, some of the truckers fear that immigrants might assault
them.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, at 10 a.m., one driver takes the risk.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique pulls himself up into the cab of an 18-wheeler hauling
beer.</TE>
<TE>   "Where are you from?" the driver asks.</TE>
<TE>   Honduras.</TE>
<TE>   "Where are you going?" The driver has seen boys like Enrique
before. "Do you have a mom or dad in the United States?"</TE>
<TE>   Enrique tells him about his mother.</TE>
<TE>   A sign at Los Pocitos says, "Checkpoint in 100 Meters." The truck
idles in line. Then it inches forward. Judicial police officers ask
the driver what he is carrying. They want his papers. They peer at
Enrique.</TE>
<TE>   The driver is ready: My assistant.</TE>
<TE>   But the officers do not ask.</TE>
<TE>   A few feet farther on, soldiers stop each vehicle to search for
drugs and guns. Two fresh-faced recruits wave them through.</TE>
<TE>   Oblivious to chatter on the trucker's two-way radio, Enrique falls
asleep. The driver clears two more checkpoints. As he nears the Rio
Grande, he stops to eat. He buys Enrique a plate of eggs and refried
beans and a soda, another gift.</TE>
<TE>   Riding a truck, Enrique figures, is a dream.</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen miles before the border, he sees a sign: "Reduce Your
Speed. Nuevo Laredo Customs."</TE>
<TE>   Don't worry, the driver says, la migra check only the buses.</TE>
<TE>   A sign says, "Bienvenidos a Nuevo Laredo." Welcome to Nuevo
Laredo.</TE>
<TE>   The driver drops him off. With 30 pesos he has left, he takes a
bus that winds into the city.</TE>
<TE>   He has one more piece of good fortune. At the Plaza Hidalgo, in
the heart of Nuevo Laredo, Enrique sees a man from Honduras whom he
has met on a train. The man takes him to an encampment along the Rio
Grande. Enrique likes it. He decides to stay until he can cross.</TE>
<TE>   That night, as the sun sets, Enrique stares across the Rio Grande
and gazes at the United States. It looms as a mystery.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere over there lives his mother. She has become a
mystery too. He was so young when she left that he can barely remember
what she looks like: curly hair; eyes like chocolate. Her voice is a
distant sound on the phone.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique has spent 47 days bent on nothing but surviving. Now, as
he thinks about her, he is overwhelmed.</TE>

<HD>Colonel Guilty in Murder of Anthropologist</HD>
<DH>Guatemala: Military officer in elite unit is convicted of
ordering the 1990 political killing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>One Guatemalan military officer was convicted and two others were
cleared Thursday of ordering the murder of an anthropologist more
than a decade ago, the first time a high-ranking officer has been
found guilty of a political crime committed during the country's
brutal civil war.</LD>
<LD>   Col. Juan Valencia Osorio, a retired Guatemalan military officer
who was a member of an elite presidential guard unit frequently
accused of human rights violations, was found guilty by a panel of
judges of ordering the assassination of Myrna Mack outside her
Guatemala City office Sept. 11, 1990. He was sentenced to 30 years in
prison.</LD>
<LD>   Gen. Edgar Augusto Godoy, who directed the infamous unit, and Col.
Juan Guillermo Oliva, also a member, were found not guilty in the
murder. Both men are retired.</LD>
<TE>   At the time of her murder, Mack, 39, had just published a study on
the millions of Guatemalans, mostly Maya Indians, who fled military
repression during the nation's civil war, which ended in 1996 after
36 years.</TE>
<TE>   The case was a small step forward for justice in Latin America,
and it was also vindication for Mack's sister, Helen, who spent 12
years pursuing her sibling's killers.</TE>
<TE>   An army sergeant was found guilty in 1993 of stabbing Mack to
death, but Thursday's decision revealed the depth of the military's
involvement in the killing.</TE>
<TE>   The country's history was a dominant theme during the trial, which
riveted a nation still trying to come to grips with its violent past.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe this is a victory for Guatemala," Helen Mack said. "For
the first time, we are talking about our recent past in a court of
law. And while Guatemalans don't talk about our recent history,
Guatemala is not going to move on, we are not going to be able to
enter into a reconciliation process."</TE>
<TE>   But Valencia's lawyer said the focus on the past was precisely the
problem.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer blamed the verdict on intense pressure from human
rights groups, and promised to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a totally unjust decision," lawyer Sergio Castro said.
"The problem is that Guatemalans continue confronting each other.
They don't want to leave behind the problems the war left us."</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups hailed the decision as a small but significant
advance in improving the administration of justice in Guatemala. "The
fact that a verdict was reached in the case does represent a first
step in the pursuit of justice and accountability in Guatemala," said
Adriana Beltran, the Guatemala specialist for the Washington Office
on Latin America, a left-leaning advocacy group. "But we can't forget
that the numerous legal obstacles and the numerous attempts to
threaten those involved in the case illustrate the continuing
weakness of Guatemala's justice system."</TE>
<TE>   Mack's case became a symbol of the impunity surrounding
Guatemala's civil war, in which, a United Nations report says, the
country's military mounted a campaign that left 200,000 people dead
or missing, most of them poor Mayas.</TE>
<TE>   The 1996 peace agreement allowed accused military figures to win
amnesty. The failure of democratic reforms and the country's
continued poverty and corruption also have contributed to an ongoing
legacy of thwarted justice.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Mack's killers would have gone unpunished if not for the
extraordinary efforts of her sister, who formed a human rights group
to investigate the murder. Helen Mack reportedly spent $3 million,
some of it donated, to pursue the case.</TE>
<TE>   Helen Mack faced enormous odds. Investigators and witnesses were
killed. She and her workers were threatened with death. An enormously
complicated legal system produced continuous setbacks and delays.</TE>
<TE>   Most challenging, Helen Mack had to crack the secretive ranks of
the country's military, which repeatedly blocked the release of
documents and information. The elite guard unit to which Myrna Mack's
killers belonged was supposed to be disbanded after the peace
accords, but it still exists.</TE>
<TE>   "This verdict lifts a small corner of the mantle of impunity that
has for far too long characterized this and most other human rights
violations in Guatemala," Michael McClintock, director of the Lawyers
Committee for Human Rights, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Myrna Mack was one of the first academics to document the effects
of the military's scorched-earth policies against the civilian
population. She had just published the first of a two-volume study
when she was killed.</TE>
<TE>   A year after her murder, American immigration officials arrested
former army Sgt. Noel de Jesus Beteta in Long Beach, where he was
working after entering the U.S. illegally shortly after Mack's
murder.</TE>

<DL>BOUAKE, Ivory Coast</DL>
<LD>Ivory Coast rebels agreed to a cease-fire Thursday in an offensive
that has taken half the country in slightly more than two weeks,
clearing the way for peace talks, West African mediators announced.</LD>
<LD>   Foreign ministers from Ghana, Togo, Niger, Nigeria and Mali had
flown into the heart of guerrilla-held territory to press for the
cease-fire.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking in the central city of Bouake, where the talks took
place, negotiator Mohamed ibn Chambas said a cease-fire deal would be
signed in the nation's capital, Yamoussoukro, today.</LD>
<TE>   It was not immediately clear how long the cease-fire would last,
or what, if any, conditions were attached.</TE>
<TE>   Disgruntled soldiers began an uprising Sept. 19 and have since
captured Bouake and the northern opposition stronghold of Korhogo, as
well as most of the northern half of the country.</TE>

parts of state-owned companies.</LD>
<LD>   The demonstrators from all over France were led by electricity and

telecommunications giant France Telecom. Police said the protesters

<HD>Coalition Bombs Iraqi Hub in 'No-Fly' Zone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. and British warplanes bombed an Iraqi air defense operations
center Thursday after President Saddam Hussein's troops fired on
allied aircraft dropping leaflets warning his military not to target
jets patrolling two "no-fly" zones.</LD>
<LD>   The bombing of the command center near Tallil, about 160 miles
southeast of Baghdad, was the latest in an aggressive series of
airstrikes against Iraqi air defenses launched by the U.S. and
Britain as they step up the tempo of patrols and bombing missions.</LD>
<LD>   It was the third time in eight days that coalition warplanes have
launched strikes in the area, aimed at destroying communications
equipment, control radar and a surface-to-air missile launcher.</LD>
<TE>   The no-fly zones, which Baghdad does not recognize, were imposed
by the U.S. and Britain following the 1991 Persian Gulf War to
protect a ethnic Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq and Shiite Muslim
areas in the south.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld recently announced that U.S.
and British warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones had shifted tactics
from bombing small batteries of antiaircraft missiles to targeting
major Iraqi air defense sites.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had ordered the change within the last six months
because he was tired of having U.S. planes fired upon with
"impunity," but military officials acknowledged that the move could
help clear air corridors for an allied attack.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Iraq has fired on coalition aircraft 68 times,
including 15 times in the last week, military officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and Britain have retaliated, bringing to 46 the number of
"strike days" reported this year by the Pentagon. On some days, more
than one area or site is bombed. Repeat missions have become common.
On Tuesday, coalition aircraft struck for the sixth time in a month
near Al Kut, about 100 miles southeast of Baghdad, because Iraqis
keep moving mobile radar equipment to the area, Pentagon officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's strike targeted an Iraqi command post in the south. The
Pentagon said the site was a communications hub for radar
surveillance and antiaircraft missile sites in the southern no-fly
zone.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon said the Iraqi strike intended to down one of dozens
of U.S. planes dropping thousands of leaflets over southern Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The leaflets depict a warplane bombing a missile launcher and a
radar site with the message in Arabic: "Iraqi ADA [air defense
artillery] Beware! Don't track or fire on coalition aircraft!"</TE>
<TE>   "The destruction experienced by your colleagues in other air
defense locations is a response to your continuing aggression toward
planes of the coalition forces," the leaflets say, according to an
English translation provided by defense officials. "No tracking or
firing on these aircraft will be tolerated. You could be next."</TE>

<DH>Mideast: With Israel's curfews keeping Palestinians in the

<AU>MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NABLUS, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Ahmad Amira and his friends in this battered city just want to finish
their senior year of high school, a goal such bright, engaging boys
might once have taken for granted. At the moment, though, he has a
more prosaic view of the future.</LD>
<LD>   "Our first ambition is to survive," said Ahmad, 17, as he and half
a dozen boys his age stood in an alley that snaked between old stone
houses.</LD>
<LD>   Just getting to school has become more of a challenge than any
academic subject since a Palestinian uprising, or intifada, began two
years ago. Israel responded with a military occupation that has
featured round-the-clock curfews.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, Israeli media carried an estimate from UNICEF that
226,000 Palestinian children, about one-quarter of the total, were
unable to get to their schools during the first month of the school
year, which began Sept. 1. At least 580 schools were closed,
primarily because Israeli curfews made it illegal for anyone to leave
their homes in the largest West Bank cities. In Nablus, which has
been particularly hard hit, a 24-hour curfew was in effect for 23
days in September.</TE>
<TE>   "You can imagine the frustration," said Pierre Poupard, UNICEF's
special representative in the occupied territories.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of the school year, parents and teachers in some
West Bank cities banded together and organized small, ad hoc schools
that typically met in homes or businesses where children from the
immediate neighborhood could learn.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, Ahmad attended such a school, which convened daily
in an old bakery a couple of blocks from his house. In a bare,
high-ceilinged room with thick stone walls and a concrete floor, high
school classes were offered to nine boys and nine girls in physics,
chemistry, literature and English, all taught by volunteers who lived
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers could find no teachers for biology, religion or Arabic
grammar, so those classes--ordinarily part of the Palestinian
curriculum--were not offered.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more or less like school, but without the atmosphere of
school," said one boy, Wasim Bolos, 17.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, parents in Nablus decided that their children would
be better off defying the curfew and going to their regular schools,
so most of the underground classrooms were closed. In recent days,
the Israeli military has decided to relax the curfews in some cities
to allow children to attend school legally.</TE>
<TE>   That is a step in the right direction, said the UNICEF's Poupard.
However, he added, the situation is fluid. Generally, curfews are
tightened after attacks against Israel, such as the suicide bombings
that have claimed more than 250 Israeli lives in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to fully assess how the chaos of the last two
years has harmed Palestinian students. Kirsten Zaat, a spokeswoman
for UNICEF, said a study of the 2000-01 school year--the first of the
current intifada--showed that the grades of students in schools
administered by the United Nations Relief and Works Administration
had suffered but that those in schools administered by the
Palestinian Authority had not.</TE>
<TE>   However, she said, U.N. officials believe that the reason is that
teachers in the Palestinian Authority schools had compensated by
grading more leniently.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as we're concerned, anecdotally, there is a decline in
performance," Zaat said.</TE>
<TE>   Nader Atallah Wahbeh, a researcher with the Qattan Center for
Educational Research and Development in the West Bank city of
Ramallah, said he fears that student performance is suffering not
just because schools are often closed but also because children are
too distracted to pay attention even when classes are held.</TE>
<TE>   "Children are having difficulty concentrating and getting back
into regular classroom life," he said. "They are disturbed.... Also,
they feel that the subject matter is sometimes irrelevant. Teachers
have no techniques to make the subject matter relevant to the
conditions they are living under."</TE>
<TE>   His organization, which focuses on teacher training, has been
trying to help teachers deal with the situation, he said. It has
urged teachers to set aside a few minutes every morning to let their
students talk about their fears and concerns, in the hope that they
then will be better able to focus on learning.</TE>
<TE>   During an informal discussion, Ahmad and his friends spoke of
yearning for a life free of fear or violence. They also smiled
broadly at mention of recent suicide bombings, including one in Tel
Aviv that killed seven people, including the bomber.</TE>
<TE>   "When people have no other choice, this is what they end up
doing," Ahmad said.</TE>
<TE>   They were asked: Are they at all optimistic about the future?</TE>
<TE>   Ali Khalili, 17, a tall, thin boy with a black goatee and hooded
brows, answered for the group. "The way we live today," he said, "we
don't have hope for anything. When they lift the curfew for a few
hours every week, that's what we look forward to. We can't look any
farther than that."</TE>

<LD>The girl runs down the narrow aisles of her father's grocery,
snatching crackers, water bottles and pastries off the shelves.</LD>
<LD>   Gladys Gonzalez Hernandez waits for the diesel horn. There it is,
at last! She runs outside. Gladys and her father, Ciro Gonzalez
Ramos, wave up to the immigrants on board the train. She is 6 years
old.</LD>
<LD>   They stand along the tracks at Fortin de las Flores, in
the Mexican state of Veracruz, and throw the crackers and the water and
the pastries into the outstretched hands of the migrants.</LD>
<TE>   Ciro Gonzalez, 35, taught Gladys to do this; he wants her to grow
up right.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do you give them food?" she asked him once. Her father said,
"Because they have traveled far and haven't eaten."</TE>
<TE>   No one recalls when it started, probably in the 1980s, when
Central Americans, fleeing war and poverty, began riding the rails
north in large numbers. Wherever the trains stopped, the immigrants
went, gaunt and dirty, to front doors to beg. Occasionally one would
fall off a train, weak with hunger.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually people along the tracks, particularly in the state of
Veracruz, began to bring food out to the trains, often where they
slowed for curves or bad tracks. Those who had no food brought
plastic bottles of tap water. As the procession of migrants has
grown, so has the determination to help.</TE>
<TE>   At 6 p.m. on a summer day, Jesus Gonzalez Roman, 40, and his
sister Magdalena Gonzalez Roman, 31, sit outside their rail-side home
in the town of Encinar. Neighbors come out to chat after long hours
of work as bricklayers and field hands.</TE>
<TE>   They hear a diesel horn.</TE>
<TE>   Magdalena and her brother have two minutes. They run inside. Their
mother, Esperanza Roman Gonzalez, 78, adjusts her pink apron and
grabs her cane.</TE>
<TE>   Jesus plucks three sweaters from a nylon bag, hand-me-downs from
relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Magdalena puts tortillas into an orange-colored bag, then snatches
bread rolls and stuffs them into a blue bag. She ladles lemonade into
a plastic bottle, spilling some in her haste.</TE>
<TE>   The horn on the locomotive grows louder, more frequent.</TE>
<TE>   At the stove, she scoops a bowl of stew into a plastic
bag. "Ready?" she mutters. "We have bread, tortillas ... " She dashes
to the front room.</TE>
<TE>   The horn blasts nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Jesus and Magdalena race outside, where their mother is already
hobbling past the wooden front gate, her long gray braids swinging.</TE>
<TE>   It is dusk. Headlights glow on the train. It slows for a curve.
The ground rumbles. Wheels pound. The engineer sounds the horn five
times, warning the 20-odd people who have come out with food, drink
and clothing to be very careful.</TE>
<TE>   Jesus and Magdalena edge close to the tracks, dig in
their heels and brace each other, so wind around the train will not
suck them under the wheels.</TE>
<TE>   Jesus spots immigrants on a hopper car. "Some are on top!" he
yells. He waves the sweaters above his head.</TE>
<TE>   A teen-ager in a green and white shirt edges down the ladder on
the hopper. He holds on with his right hand and reaches out with his
left.</TE>
<TE>   Now seconds count.</TE>
<TE>   Magdalena hands Jesus her blue bag of bread. He thrusts it up,
along with the sweaters. A moment later, Magdalena pushes up a bottle
of lemonade.</TE>
<TE>   The youngster grabs everything.</TE>
<TE>   "Gracias!" he yells above the din.</TE>
<TE>   "Que Dios los lleve! May God watch over you!" Jesus shouts back,
eyes smiling.</TE>
<TE>   Esperanza stands silently, her hands stretched upward. She
prays to the Virgin of Guadalupe, asking her to bring all the children
on the train safely to their worried mothers in El Norte.</TE>

<HD>Tuvalu's Sinking Feeling</HD>
<DH>A Pacific island nation fears vanishing beneath the waves.
It is weighing a suit against the U.S. over emissions blamed for
global warming.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VAIAKU, Tuvalu</DL>
<LD>This isolated country is not much more than a few specks in the
middle of the Pacific Ocean. Its population wouldn't fill a fifth of
Dodger Stadium. Its highest point is 16 feet above sea level.</LD>
<LD>   But Tuvalu is at the center of international debate over climate
change. Many of Tuvalu's people worry that rising sea levels caused
by global warming will wash away their country.</LD>
<LD>   They talk of suing the U.S. government or big American
corporations for polluting the atmosphere and causing the planet's
temperature to rise. They condemn President Bush for backing out of
the Kyoto Protocol on global warming.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't have hills or mountains. All we have is coconut trees,"
elder statesman Koloa Talake said. "If the industrial countries don't
consider our crisis, our only alternative is to climb up in the
coconut trees when the tide rises."</TE>
<TE>   By all appearances, Tuvalu is a Polynesian paradise. With seven
coral atolls and two coral islands, the country is spread across 350
miles of the South Pacific north of New Zealand. Palm trees grow
along white sand beaches that fringe the turquoise waters of lagoons.</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen whether science will support Tuvalu's
predictions of impending doom, but no one doubts that the country
faces a precarious existence.</TE>
<TE>   At the ripe age of 65 million years, its atolls are nearing the
end of their geologic life span. Not only do islanders face the
danger of the sea rising, they also face the inevitable problem of
the land sinking.</TE>
<TE>   Each atoll was formed when a volcanic island sank beneath the sea,
leaving a ring of coral islands around a lagoon.</TE>
<TE>   An outer reef protects the land from the pounding of the sea. The
coral can grow upward and keep pace with a gradual increase in sea
level, but if the ocean rises too quickly, the natural barrier could
be lost.</TE>
<TE>   "If the reef is destroyed, it's goodbye, Tuvalu," said Wolfgang
Scherer, director of Australia's National Tidal Facility.</TE>
<TE>   The atolls are especially vulnerable to tropical storms that can
change the landscape overnight. In 1997, a cyclone swept the topsoil
and every tree and bush off the islet of Tepuka Savilivili in
Tuvalu's main atoll, Funafuti.</TE>
<TE>   This former British colony has just 10 square miles of land and a
population of 10,400, making it, next to Vatican City, the world's
least populous country.</TE>
<TE>   The Tuvaluans are Polynesians whose ancestors arrived by canoe
possibly more than 2,000 years ago. Today they fish, raise pigs and
grow taro, cassava, bananas and coconuts on small plots of land.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the jobs are in government. Some men leave Tuvalu to find
work as seamen on cargo ships or as unskilled laborers in New
Zealand.</TE>
<TE>   Men and women commonly wear flowers in their hair. Many houses
have thatched roofs and walls made of woven mats. When the country's
12-member Parliament is not meeting in the open-sided Maneapa meeting
hall, boys play soccer there.</TE>
<TE>   Tuvalu is connected to the outside world only by flights to Fiji
twice a week and by occasional cargo ships that bring supplies.
Visitors are few. The country has one hotel, which has no hot water.</TE>
<TE>   On Funafuti, television is normally broadcast one evening a week
for two hours, although now it is off the air entirely because of an
equipment breakdown. A few people, mostly government officials, have
computers and can connect to the Internet. There are few cars, and
most people get around on foot or by motorbike.</TE>
<TE>   Tuvalu had little contact with the outside world until Spanish
explorers arrived in 1781. In the 1800s, slave traders stole hundreds
of people from the islands to work the guano mines of Peru.
Missionaries converted the rest of the population to Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   Today, many Tuvaluans have a literal faith in the Bible and don't
believe any harm will come from global warming.</TE>
<TE>   Shopkeeper Lutelu Kofe, 46, is typical. He is more concerned about
harm to the community from rising alcohol levels than rising water
levels.</TE>
<TE>   "I read the Bible, and God said to Noah, 'No more floods,' " Kofe
said. "So I'm not worried. When I see the sea, it's the same as
before."</TE>
<TE>   But the Tuvaluan government is marshaling its arguments in the
hope of winning foreign help in finding a new home if the need
arises.</TE>
<TE>   Tuvalu has hired an attorney in Washington and is considering
whether its best strategy is to sue the U.S. government or American
oil companies, coal mining firms and auto makers. But officials
acknowledge that pinning the blame for global warming on individual
companies would be a long shot.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Tuvalu asked Australia to agree to accept its entire
population in the event the islands are flooded, but Australia
refused. New Zealand has agreed to accept 75 Tuvaluans a year, but
many islanders can't afford to make the move.</TE>
<TE>   Nine years ago, scientists from Australia's National Tidal
Facility installed high-tech gauges in Tuvalu and 10 other Pacific
nations to measure changes in sea level.</TE>
<TE>   The Tuvalu gauge has detected an average increase of 1 millimeter
a year--the same rate at which the oceans have been rising for the
last century. "The critical question is whether sea level rise is
going to accelerate," said Scherer, the tidal facility director. "So
far, there is no evidence of that happening in Tuvalu or anywhere
else around the globe."</TE>
<TE>   As the Earth's average temperature has gone up over the last
century, glaciers in the Rocky Mountains, the Swiss Alps, the
Himalayas and the Andes have receded.</TE>
<TE>   The great fear is that the huge ice sheets of Greenland and
Antarctica will melt, drastically increasing the volume of water in
the oceans and inundating low-lying coastal areas.</TE>
<TE>   The 1997 Kyoto Protocol was designed to slow global warming by
reducing air pollution, particularly carbon dioxide, which many
scientists believe creates a greenhouse effect. The Bush
administration pulled out of the agreement last year, citing
potential harm to the U.S. economy if companies were compelled to cut
such emissions.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing for their existence, the low-lying island nations of
Kiribati, the Marshall Islands and Nauru in the Pacific and the
Maldives in the Indian Ocean have joined Tuvalu in urging the United
States to reduce its atmospheric pollution.</TE>
<TE>   "Tuvalu is the first victim of global warming," said Talake, a
former prime minister. "We don't see any way of avoiding that. The
only thing we can do is hope that industrial countries may listen to
our poor voice."</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, U.S. troops landed in Tuvalu to halt the
Japanese advance in the Pacific. Their job was to build a landing
strip on Fongafale, Funafuti's main island, and they needed precious
dirt. The troops collected soil by digging 10 large holes on the
island, some as big as 300 feet long and 50 feet wide.</TE>
<TE>   People here call them "the borrow pits," but no one has ever
returned any dirt. About a third of the island's arable land was lost
to the pits and the runway. Tuvalu has asked Washington for
assistance in filling the holes, but the U.S. has declined to help on
the grounds that the runway is sufficient compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the 10-foot-deep pits hold water that rises and falls with
the tide. Scientists say the flow has accelerated the intrusion of
seawater into Fongafale's aquifer, speeding up the island's
deterioration.</TE>
<TE>   While the islanders criticize industrial countries for emitting
carbon dioxide, Tuvalu has its own pollution problem. For years,
people have dumped garbage into the borrow pits--everything from beer
cans and pig waste to old car bodies and rusting cargo containers.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the time of year when the tides typically are
highest, the water in one borrow pit rose to within an inch of
flooding the home of third-grade teacher Easter Molu.</TE>
<TE>   "We think maybe next year the water will be inside our house,"
said Molu, 27. "Some people don't want to stay in Tuvalu. They are
scared of the sea level. They might drown. They might be eaten by
sharks. They worry about their children's and their grandchildren's
future."</TE>
<TE>   Flooding inundates places that never used to be underwater,
including ancestral graves and the foundations of a building
constructed in 1904. Salt water intrudes into gardens, killing crops
and ruining the soil. Valuable coastal land is lost to erosion. Some
coral in the lagoon is bleached white, possibly because of higher
ocean temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans should look at themselves," Molu said, "because what
they are doing affects other countries, like Tuvalu."</TE>

<HD>Nearing Unity on Inspections</HD>
<DH>United Nations: France, a frequent critic of U.S. strategy
toward Iraq, agrees that clear, new rules are needed in the hunt for
weapons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL and ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>The United States on Thursday appeared to head off any move by the
U.N. Security Council to send weapons inspectors back to Iraq under
current rules that have repeatedly failed in the past.</LD>
<LD>   Displaying uncharacteristic unity on the Iraq issue,
representatives from several countries-- including Britain, France
and the U.S.--said after a 2 1/2-hour meeting that a new Security
Council resolution was needed to clarify "loose ends" before the
inspectors' return.</LD>
<LD>   Diplomats said the issues include gaining unfettered access to
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's presidential compounds -- eight
large plots of land, many of them containing dozens of buildings,
that had been virtually impossible to inspect under existing rules.</LD>
<TE>   "We've said it's prudent to have new practical arrangements before
we go, and we still think this," said chief U.N. weapons inspector
Hans Blix.</TE>
<TE>   The development seemed to end the push last month by several U.N.
member states who wanted inspectors back immediately, after Iraq
consented to their return under existing rules--a prospect strongly
opposed by the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the emerging consensus on the need for new, clear rules
for inspections, major differences still separated Security Council
members about the form they should take, and how stringent and
comprehensive the resolution containing them should be. A major
sticking point that remains is whether a new resolution would allow
for an immediate use of force if Iraq balks at inspections, a
provision strongly favored by the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   In Moscow, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Saltanov
strongly opposed a toughly worded U.S.-backed resolution, saying it
was not the time for statements advocating the use of military force.
In Paris, France stuck doggedly to its insistence that any Security
Council action against Iraq be broken into two parts--one defining
the inspections regime, a second stating the consequences if Baghdad
fails to comply.</TE>
<TE>   Events at the United Nations and in member capitals marked the
latest steps in an Anglo-American effort to rid Iraq of any nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons by conducting rigorous inspections
backed by the potential use of force if Hussein fails to cooperate.
They unfolded as the Bush administration began quietly exploring a
less hard-line strategy for passing a resolution that would win broad
support for strong action within the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   In Congress, meanwhile, debate formally began Thursday on a
domestic resolution that would give President Bush broad authority to
launch military action against Iraq if he determines that further
diplomatic efforts have proved insufficient. In the
Republican-controlled House, the International Relations Committee
approved the measure, 31 to 11. That clears the way for what is
expected to be a strong vote of support by the full House next week.</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, where many senior Democrats want to impose more
restrictions on Bush's war-making powers, the debate promises to be
more contentious. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) has
said he wants the Senate to consider at least two alternatives that
would give a larger role to the U.N. and focus the potential use of
force more narrowly on ensuring the disarmament of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   As debate opened Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott
(R-Miss.) said he hoped it would mark "the beginning of the end of
Saddam Hussein and all that he stands for."</TE>
<TE>   At the U.N., after the Security Council listened Thursday to
Blix's report on his meetings earlier this week in Vienna with Iraqi
negotiators, members seemed to agree not just that new rules were
needed but also that inspectors should return to Iraq as soon as
possible once more stringent rules are established.</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with Baghdad's recent conciliatory posture, Iraqi
Ambassador to the U.N. Mohammed Douri said resolving the problem of
access to the presidential compounds "would not be an issue of
difficulty" between Iraq and the weapons inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Blix reached agreement in his talks with the Iraqis that
inspectors would return to Baghdad on Oct. 19. However, he indicated
Thursday that he would not go until the Security Council had voted on
a new resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "We're ready to go at the earliest practical opportunity," Blix
said. "If there is a delay, it wouldn't be a long one. I think the
council would want us to go early."</TE>
<TE>   Blix was scheduled to meet with senior Bush administration
officials in Washington today. While the chief inspector described
the visit as a routine consultation, the talks are expected to
include a detailed briefing on his meetings with Iraqi negotiators
and his assessment of what he needs to make the inspections work.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Bush stepped up pressure on the United Nations to
quickly pass a resolution authorizing a tough weapons inspection
regime in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes to defending our freedom, the United States of
America will stand united and stand strong," Bush told a meeting of
Latino leaders in Washington. "The choice is up [to] the United
Nations to show its resolve."</TE>
<TE>   But there were also softer elements to his rhetoric Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "The military option is my last choice, not my first. It's my last
choice," Bush said. "But Saddam has got to understand, the United
Nations must know, that the will of this country is strong."</TE>
<TE>   In the last few days, the White House has all but dropped
references to the need for "regime change" in Iraq, stressing instead
that ensuring the Persian Gulf nation has no weapons of mass
destruction is the goal, and use of force the last resort to achieve
it.</TE>
<TE>   Coupled with this rhetoric, the Bush administration is quietly
exploring a backup strategy for winning a U.N. resolution that would
bridge the wide gap between the United States and its French and
Russian partners on the Security Council, according to U.S.
officials.</TE>
<TE>   The compromise would more closely match the French approach that
the Security Council should pass a resolution now governing a tough
new regime of weapons inspections but put off passage of a second
measure that would authorize the use of force.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than wait until there is a so-called material breach to
discuss the terms, Washington is probing the possibility of locking
in agreement now on the specific language of a resolution that spells
out the consequences--and then in effect shelving it unless there is
a showdown over inspections.</TE>
<TE>   The critical difference is timing. France, many in the Arab world
and other U.N. members want to defer the issue of force, a position
that U.S. officials reject on two counts:</TE>
<TE>   * Washington believes that weapons inspectors will have no
leverage over Iraq unless the threat of force looms.</TE>
<TE>   * A measure now that does not approve the use of force could lead
to another, potentially time-consuming diplomatic clash some months
down the road.</TE>
<TE>   "It's critically important not to lose the current momentum," said
a well-placed administration official, who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Baghdad's goal, U.S. officials say, is to try to stall until late
March, when extremely hot weather in the region begins to limit
military options. The working assumption in Washington is that if
Iraq can stall until March, it may have bought eight more months.</TE>
<TE>   The inter-agency group handling Iraq strategy has not yet blessed
the compromise option, U.S. officials say. But American and British
envoys have been working on it as a fallback position.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer on Thursday declined to
repeat previous remarks that the French proposal for two resolutions
was unacceptable. And he was careful to describe regime change as a
policy adopted by Congress. Fleischer also declined to confirm that
the administration has shifted its stance, replying that negotiations
over a possible U.N. resolution are secret.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer suggested that the president's position may have
shifted--in private.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you know the president has not moved?" he asked. "I submit
to you that much of these negotiations are, as you would expect,
diplomatic conversations that take place in private."</TE>
<TE>   In Paris, a French Foreign Ministry spokesman reiterated the words
of President Jacques Chirac, who on Wednesday night spoke forcefully
in favor of his nation's two-step approach. The French leader was
joined at the presidential palace in Paris by German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, whose criticism of potential military action
against Iraq has annoyed the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   "We are indeed hostile to any resolution that grants an automatic
character to a military intervention," Chirac said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The French believe that U.N. inspections have a realistic chance
of working.</TE>
<TE>   "Above all, we want Iraq to be stripped of any arms of mass
destruction and that this be controlled without any ambiguity,"
Chirac said.</TE>
<TE>   In Moscow, Saltanov, the deputy foreign minister, declared that
any move toward military action against Baghdad must wait until
inspectors make their initial report.</TE>
<TE>   "The document presented to us by the Britons and the Americans has
only strengthened our confidence in the correctness of our stance
favoring the earliest relaunch of inspections and monitoring
activities in Iraq, and a general political settlement without the
use of force," Saltanov said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that unilateral military action by the United States
would undermine "international legal fundamentals" which "enable
civilized settlement of modern problems."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Protester of N. Koreans' Plight Opens Fire, Hitting
U.N. Building</HD>

<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>A gunman fired seven shots in front of the U.N. headquarters on
Thursday, then scattered leaflets protesting the plight of North
Koreans before being detained by security officials.</LD>
<LD>   The man, identified as Steve Kim, entered U.N. grounds unnoticed
until he started firing a .357-magnum revolver. At least two shots
hit the building on the 18th and 20th floors, narrowly missing
several U.N. employees, but no one was injured, according to U.N.
security chief Michael McCann.</LD>
<LD>   Kim, 56 or 57, seemed calm after he fired the gun, said Michael
Hovey, who witnessed the incident on his way to a meeting in the
building. "He threw the gun down, like he was disgusted, then walked
to the wall and threw papers up in the air. Then he sat down and
waited."</LD>
<TE>   U.S. Secret Service agents who were part of a security detail for
visiting Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides quickly apprehended Kim.
They were joined moments later by United Nations security and State
Department protective personnel who were on the site.</TE>
<TE>   Security quickly closed the streets around the U.N. and locked
down the building. Inside, the Security Council continued its meeting
on disarmament in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Kim apparently had been handing out leaflets to passersby before
he jumped the hedge-covered wall. The papers were covered in tiny
cramped handwriting in broken English and were addressed to "all
people who love freedom and justice."</TE>
<TE>   "In a shinning and civilized 21st century, most people in the
world enjoying peace and freedom. North Korea however is groaning
under the weight of starvation and dictatorial suppression." It was
signed: "A citizen of UN, Steve Kim, Oct. 2, 2002."</TE>
<TE>   Kim was questioned by New York City police officers and FBI agents
before being transferred to FBI custody and taken out of U.N.
headquarters 90 minutes after the shooting. According to FBI
spokesman Jim Margolin, Kim is a naturalized U.S. citizen from Des
Plaines, Ill., where he is a postal worker. He will be arraigned in
federal court this morning.</TE>
<TE>   Security chief McCann said the incident pointed out the need to
enhance measures at the world body's headquarters. He said that the
6-foot-high fence can be easily scaled and that there are not enough
guards to cover every foot of the U.N.'s sprawling grounds.</TE>
<TE>   The security service had been asking for a reinforced fence for
nearly 20 years, U.N. officials said, but only recently received
funding for 36 additional officers, a backup fence and cameras.</TE>

<HD>Plight of Vietnamese Actor Garners U.S. Attention</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANITA M. BUSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. government has taken an interest in the plight of a
Vietnamese actor accused of being "a national traitor" for
co-starring in two Hollywood films.</LD>
<LD>   Don Duong, the 45-year-old actor who lives in Ho Chi Minh City,
came to the attention of the State Department this week after several
Hollywood figures, including actors Mel Gibson, Patrick Swayze,
Forest Whitaker and Harvey Keitel and filmmaker Randall Wallace began
a letter-writing campaign to the U.S. ambassador in Hanoi and other
officials in Vietnam and Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Gibson appeared with Duong in Wallace's "We Were Soldiers," and
Swayze and Whitaker co-starred with him in "Green Dragon."</LD>
<TE>   State-owned newspapers in Vietnam have quoted numerous government
officials as saying that Duong is a traitor and has "lost his honor"
by appearing in two films that "distort the legitimate war history of
our people and the humanity of the Vietnamese people."</TE>
<TE>   The government has seized his passport and threatened him with
jail and with a five-year ban on acting or leaving the country.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Consulate General in Saigon has contacted Duong's family
in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, and is scheduling a meeting
with Duong to check his physical well-being, officials told members
of the actor's family. Duong has three sisters in the U.S., and a
sister and younger brother in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   In Vietnam on Thursday, Duong's U.S. family was told, the actor
was questioned for eight hours by PA-25, the government division in
Ho Chi Minh City that regulates the country's cultural affairs,
including literature, television, film and theater. At the end of the
daylong meeting, Duong was asked to sign a statement professing guilt
as a traitor, but he refused to do so. Duong, who has starred in more
than 50 films, is expected to be interrogated again by PA-25.</TE>
<TE>   The Vietnamese Consulate in San Francisco did not respond to
requests for comment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Duong starred with Keitel in the 1999 drama "Three Seasons," a
film that was embraced by Vietnam's Ministry of Culture.</TE>
<TE>   One of Duong's nephews, Tony Bui, who with his brother Timothy
Linh Bui made "Green Dragon" and "Three Seasons," said the family in
the U.S. is hoping for "a speedy resolution." According to Tony Bui:
"They have branded him incorrectly. He loves his country, and the
accusations are false. We hope he doesn't get prosecuted and gets his
good name back."</TE>
<TE>   Howard Lavick, acting dean of the school of film and television at
Loyola Marymount University, joined the letter-writing campaign
Thursday on behalf of Duong.</TE>
<TE>   "I met Don in Sundance when he was there for 'Three Seasons.' ...
Don is a very warm person. He's the type of person who should not be
branded a national traitor. He's very proud of his Vietnamese
heritage," Lavick said.</TE>

<HD>Will N.Y. M.O. Work in L.A.?</HD>
<DH>Chief: Crime plummeted on Bratton's watch there, but some
doubt he can repeat that success here.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER and GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that New York City crime fighter William J. Bratton has been
selected to head the Los Angeles Police Department, the question
becomes: Can he do it here?</LD>
<LD>   In his 27-month reign as police commissioner in New York City,
Bratton oversaw double-digit declines in crime; violent felonies fell
by a third and homicides were cut in half. It was that record that
made him one of the country's best-known chiefs and that helped him
secure the top job at the LAPD.</LD>
<LD>   Bratton, who titled his 1998 autobiography "Turnaround: How
America's Top Cop Reversed the Crime Epidemic," is one of many who
credit the NYPD and his leadership with playing a large role in
reducing New York crime.</LD>
<TE>   Still, there is considerable skepticism among academics and
policing experts that Bratton can neatly replicate New York's crime
statistics from those years in this city at this time. Among other
things, the LAPD is far smaller than the NYPD.</TE>
<TE>   But Bratton is widely admired for his creativity and insistence on
accountability. His admirers say that bodes well for crime fighting
in the nation's second-largest city under Bratton's watch.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to be the Bill Bratton method applied to L.A.,"
said Richard Emery, a New York City civil rights lawyer and Bratton's
lawyer as well. "I don't think that's what will occur. It's going to
be the creativity of Bill Bratton for L.A. That is the key factor
here."</TE>
<TE>   In New York, Bratton employed a computer statistical program aimed
at identifying problem areas, directing resources there and holding
supervisors accountable for reducing crime.</TE>
<TE>   As commissioner in New York, Bratton defined those methods as
community policing, and positioned himself as a leading advocate of
that law enforcement style. Indeed, he said Thursday he will expand
the system for tracking crime in the LAPD and that he will encourage
officers "to take back the streets" of Los Angeles--an echo of the
rhetoric he employed in taking over the NYPD in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "What we effectively did in New York was use quality-of-life
control by the police--understandably with a much larger police
force--that literally for 25 years did not have a modicum of
quality-of-life enforcement," Bratton said at a morning news
conference.</TE>
<TE>   But Bratton will have far fewer officers in a far larger
geographical area, making cop-on-the-beat policing difficult. That's
likely to provoke a debate over exactly what is meant by community
policing here in Los Angeles--the assertive style of Bratton's NYPD
or the more community-relations oriented approach the LAPD has
practiced in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "There are probably 150 visions of community policing," said
former Philadelphia Police Commissioner John F. Timoney, who was a
finalist for the LAPD job and who was one of Bratton's most trusted
aides in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is his [program] is problem solving, not just
dealing with the immediate problem but fixing it once and for all."</TE>
<TE>   For New York, community policing meant the broken window approach:
cracking down on small problems in a neighborhood in order to avoid
the bigger, more violent ones.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say his biggest challenge is he will not have the number
of people in proportion to the population that he had in New York
City," said James Q. Wilson, a retired UCLA professor who is
considered the godfather of that theory. "In New York, you have
enough officers to do ordinary and specialized patrols. Here, you
need virtually every officer."</TE>
<TE>   The NYPD has nearly 40,000 police officers, compared to more than
9,000 in Los Angeles. Although New York is the bigger city, that
still amounts to one officer for every 209 residents of that city and
one for every 409 Los Angeles residents.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be the greatest challenge of Commissioner Bratton's
career to take on the complex crime problems in Los Angeles with a
force that's much smaller than what he had," said Jeffrey Fagan, a
Columbia University professor of law and public health.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton's arrival in L.A. reignites an old debate: the question of
how much the police in New York were responsible for that city's drop
in crime in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "Historians like to argue that things are intertwined and one
factor can never explain a phenomenon, but he gets a lot of credit,
and of course the 40,000 men and women [in the New York Police
Department] get a lot of credit, for what happened here in New York,"
said Robert McCrie, chairman of the law, police science and criminal
justice administration department at John Jay College of Criminal
Justice in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   "If we list the forces that can have an effect, good or bad,
policing would be at the top, and Bratton was the police chief," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In his autobiography, Bratton skewered academic experts who at
first explained away New York's double-digit drop in crime during the
mid-1990s: "We lined up their alternate reasons like ducks in a row
and shot them all down," Bratton wrote, dismissing arguments that the
strong economy and changing demographics, among other things, were
the real reasons for the drop in violence.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, McCrie said that the economic boom, with record low
unemployment, as well as a calm political climate in New York, helped
Bratton's crusade appreciably.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have reasons for riots and disorders," McCrie said.
"The city wasn't unhappy with the government."</TE>
<TE>   But there was a downside to the Bratton formula, as activists
accused the NYPD of engaging in racial profiling in their aggressive
pursuit of street crime.</TE>
<TE>   Minority communities within Los Angeles have long felt
disenfranchised by the Police Department, criticizing it for racially
profiling residents, among other things.</TE>
<TE>   The federally negotiated consent decree in Los Angeles, which grew
out of the Rampart corruption scandal, has been blamed in some
quarters for distracting LAPD management from the business of
fighting crime. Mayor James K. Hahn, whose office helped negotiate
the decree, disagrees and has indicated his desire to more fully
implement those reforms in the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, some experts said the decree actually may strengthen
Bratton's hand as he takes aim at crime.</TE>
<TE>   "By adhering to the order of the court, he will help build
legitimacy in the Police Department in the eyes of the minority
community," Fagan said. "Legitimacy is an important ingredient to
building citizen and department partnerships."</TE>
<TE>   Inside the department, Timoney and others say Bratton's forte will
be in fostering an environment where less-senior officers are
encouraged to be innovative in their approach to targeting violent
hot spots.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll see some junior officers get moved up almost overnight,"
Timoney said. "He's a risk taker; he will surround himself with
junior officers and he'll give them the authority to really do their
job."</TE>
<TE>   In New York, for example, Bratton shifted the working hours of
robbery detectives to match the hours of robbers, based on a
suggestion from a detective. He promoted that detective, McCrie said.</TE>
<TE>   "Bratton is a manager, an executive--maybe not a manager to
everyone's taste, but he's not going to come in saying, 'I know the
solutions to your problems,' " McCrie said. "He'll create an
environment where people who have ideas on how to solve L.A.'s
problems will feel comfortable bringing up ideas and having them
tested."</TE>
<TE>   But as Bratton moves to step up the LAPD's technological capacity
for spotting crime trends and beefs up its insistence on
accountability, he still will face deep challenges in learning the
department he will soon lead--in the city he is only just beginning
to know.</TE>
<TE>   "He can get the numbers easily, but can he get the qualitative
nature of Los Angeles?" said Geoff Alpert, a criminologist at the
University of South Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish him the best and hope he does well, but it isn't going to
be easy."</TE>

<HD>Bratton Lays Out Ambitious Set of Goals for LAPD</HD>
<DH>Police: His priorities as chief are quicker hiring,
satisfying the consent decree and wiping away any 'tarnish' on the
department's image.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>William J. Bratton said Thursday that his top priorities as Los
Angeles police chief will be to accelerate the pace of hiring, speed
the LAPD's compliance with a federal consent decree and restore the
"most famous badge in the world" to its former brilliance.</LD>
<LD>   "I will not let you down," Bratton said in his first formal
remarks since being chosen Wednesday by Mayor James K. Hahn to head
the LAPD.</LD>
<LD>   "We will build on the legacy and the tradition and the skills," he
said at a news conference at the North Hollywood police station. "And
we will take that most famous shield, and whatever little tarnish
exists ... it will be wiped clean."</LD>
<TE>   Throughout the day Bratton praised the professionalism of the
department and said television shows of decades past such as
"Dragnet" and "Adam-12" celebrated an organization that "set the
standard for so many years."</TE>
<TE>   But he also criticized the department for failing to modernize,
and said he would immediately begin to redeploy officers. For
example, he said he will make graffiti a top priority for all
officers and reconsider the way the department's specialized units,
such as robbery-homicide, operate.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, who headed the police departments in New York City and
his hometown of Boston, charged through a fast-paced day that began
with a press conference and continued with lunch at the police
academy, media interviews, appearances at station house roll calls
and meetings with community policing volunteers. Throughout the stops
he exhibited the polished speaking style and comfort in front of the
cameras that helped catapult him to fame in New York.</TE>
<TE>   In a meeting room at the North Hollywood station packed with more
than 20 television cameras and dozens of photographers and reporters,
Bratton laid out his goals for the department and a job he called
"the premier law enforcement opportunity in America today."</TE>
<TE>   He also took the opportunity to address critics' charges that he
openly lobbied for the job.</TE>
<TE>   "You better believe I campaigned," he said, his voice sharp. "You
want me to come in here and not know a damn thing about the place? I
did my homework."</TE>
<TE>   Asked to name the two biggest problems facing the LAPD, Bratton
said increasing the ranks from the current 9,000 officers up to the
10,000 authorized and implementing reforms outlined in a federal
consent decree.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles was forced last year to enter into the decree,
overseen by a judge, after the U.S. Department of Justice concluded
that the LAPD had for years been engaging in a "pattern or practice"
of civil rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, who spent a year on the team overseeing the department's
compliance with the decree, said it had shown a pattern of resistance
to implementing the reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "That will not occur when I am police chief. We will begin
immediately," said Bratton, who could start work next week pending
City Council approval.</TE>
<TE>   He also set out an ambitious goal of meeting the conditions of the
consent decree ahead of schedule. Those reforms include establishing
computerized systems to track issues such as problem officers and
illegal racial profiling. A judge had ordered the department to
comply fully by 2006.</TE>
<TE>   "The quicker we get that implemented the better for the officers
and the public," Bratton said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, who informed Bratton Wednesday that he had the job, was at
his side all day.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, the mayor stretched one arm around Bratton's
shoulders in an embrace and said with a wide smile, "See why I like
this guy so much?"</TE>
<TE>   Introducing Bratton at the news conference, the mayor said he
believed the former New York commissioner could make Los Angeles "the
safest big city in America," a challenge Bratton said he was
confident he could meet.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Bratton backed the mayor's attempt to defeat
secession campaigns in the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood. "I
can't even begin to imagine why [anyone] would want to secede from
L.A. Seriously, one of the great cities of the world."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor, whose reserved public persona contrasts with Bratton's
more flamboyant style, said in an interview with The Times that he
was unconcerned about the possibility that Bratton will attract more
attention than the man who hired him. Chatting in Hahn's office on
Thursday afternoon, the two men laughed about their perceived
differences.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm actually taller than he is," Hahn joked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, he's a much bigger presence, I noticed that," Bratton
responded.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said it wouldn't bother him if Bratton turns up on the cover
of Time magazine, as long as he gets the job done.</TE>
<TE>   "What is going to be great about working with Bill Bratton is we
share the same goals," Hahn said. "If things go right there is plenty
of credit to go around for everybody. If you are the chief of police
in Los Angeles, that automatically means you are in the spotlight. It
also means you have to deliver. I know that, because it's what mayors
are judged on too."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, at the news conference, Bratton deflected a question
about how well he will get along with Hahn in light of his clashes
with then-New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani when Bratton headed the
NYPD from 1994-96. He said he'd laid it all out in his autobiography
and given a copy to Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn later apologetically conceded he hadn't finished the book.</TE>
<TE>   In his autobiography, Bratton details the tumultuous and bitter
ending to his relationship with Giuliani, who forced him out of the
NYPD commissioner's job after an extended fight over who deserved
credit for steep declines in New York City's crime rate.</TE>
<TE>   And Bratton hotly disputed criticism raised in New York that
police officers there had become overzealous, resulting in serious
civil rights violations. He said allegations that such instances
increased under the community policing model he embraces--and plans
to bring to Los Angeles--were a creation of the media.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a gross misrepresentation of [the NYPD's] professional
activities," Bratton said.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have to worry about officers out of control" in Los
Angeles, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, who had lunch with the department's deputy chiefs, said
Thursday that he anticipates having to bring in a only few outsiders
to help him overhaul the LAPD. He joked that he would use his
"winning personality" to win over the LAPD rank and file, a corps
known for being inhospitable to outsiders. But he also pointed out he
had spent a good deal of time studying the department while working
as a consultant on consent decree compliance.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the benefits of having been here over the past year is
that I've had a chance to reach out to a lot of people at different
levels of the organization," Bratton said. "There's great talent
here, there's just a lot of them in the wrong position. It's a matter
of shuffling the deck little bit."</TE>
<TE>   One of his first orders of business will be tackling the city's
graffiti problem, which falls under the category of "quality of life"
enforcement that was his trademark as head of New York's transit
authority and as police commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   "I was amazed to find that of 9,000 persons in the Police
Department, not a single one is focused on graffiti," Bratton said.
"As a result you look like the graffiti capital of the world.... I'd
like to see more focus on that issue because it reflects community
pride. It reflects a sense of caring."</TE>
<TE>   He said he also plans to quickly reconfigure the LAPD's
specialized units, such as robbery-homicide, narcotics and gang
divisions.</TE>
<TE>   "My own sense of the Police Department is it is an
overspecialized, compartmentalized department," Bratton said. "You
are policing in the 1950s here....</TE>
<TE>   "Where you have guns, you have drugs. Where you have drugs, you
have youth. Where you have youth, you have gangs. Why treat them like
four different diseases? When you go to a doctor, he treats the
totality of all the things that are affecting your body. L.A. is not
doing that in any way, shape or form."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "You have a narcotics unit that works Monday through
Friday, 9 to 5, and on weekends there is no one fighting drug crime
in Los Angeles. If you're a drug dealer, you are going to sleep
Monday through Friday and say, 'Let's go party' on the weekends."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said he believed updating Los Angeles's computerized crime
reporting system to Compstat, the system he used in New York to break
down crime statistics street by street, will go a long way making
troubled areas safer.</TE>
<TE>   And Bratton's selection was welcomed by some of the rank and file
who listened to his remarks.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is looking forward to the change because he is going to
step up to bat and shake things up," said LAPD Homicide Det. Hollis
Berdin of the North Hollywood Division. She said she believed
Bratton's approach "is going to bring us back as the No. 1 police
department in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton--who walked a beat in Boston before working his way up the
ranks--said it wasn't until after the attack on the World Trade
Center that he realized how much he missed policing.</TE>
<TE>   "I never felt so useless in New York City than on 9/11," Bratton
said. "It's those kinds of things that make public service so
desirable. "The day the shield is pinned to my chest, that's when I
know it's real."</TE>

<HD>A Glimpse at How Bratton Thinks--In His Words</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Excerpts from William J. Bratton's 1998 book, "Turnaround: How
America's Top Cop Reversed the Crime Epidemic"</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   I admit it, I don't mind seeing my name in the papers. But, more
important, I wanted to get my message out that change was here and we
were serious.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An insider's strengths and weaknesses are known throughout an
organization, and often, because of the relationships he has formed
over time, he does not have the wherewithal to make drastic changes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Driving around the streets is very different from walking on them.
In a patrol car, the only time you talk to people is after a crime
has occurred. You're not a fixture in people's lives. You're an
authority, not a friend; an occasional presence, not a personality.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   [From his time as chief of the New York Transit Police] Once I was
satisfied they could handle the responsibility, I decentralized power
down to the 10 district commanders. I told each of them, "Here are
the goals: reduce fare evasion, disorder and crime. I have certain
requirements, mostly a certain number of cops on the trains, but
beyond that you make the decisions. How many cops do you want in
uniform, how many in plain clothes? Your call. You be creative as to
how you're going to use those cops. You supervise them, you make sure
they're not being abusive and you make them productive." All they had
to do was produce and be able to answer our questions when we asked
them. I gave them authority and responsibility but held them
accountable.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In March 1993, Ray Flynn announced that he was giving up the
mayoralty to accept the appointment as United States ambassador to
the Vatican. Mickey Roache [then the Boston police commissioner]
resigned almost immediately as police commissioner and announced he
was running for mayor. Commissioners are like that--we all think we
can be mayors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The police can't take back the streets that were effectively
de-policed for 20 years without being assertive. However, if they are
heavy-handed, if they don't get the consensus of the community, if
they don't get the leadership and supervision of their own command
staff that is so essential, then there is the potential for an
explosion like that in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   [Describing a conflict with New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani
after Giuliani forced out Bratton's top press aide, John Miller]:
Rudy Giuliani, in his haste to sweep up every crumb of credit, had
disregarded reason, personality and honor.... By clearing out the
entire public-information office, the mayor decimated the
department's institutional memory.... This is a mayor who
consistently talks about how much he loves cops, yet in his desire to
get at Miller and me, he crudely damaged the careers and lives of
these hardworking police officers and civilians. How is he ever going
to look anyone in the eye and say with a straight face that he loves
and respects cops when he has treated them so callously?</TE>

<HD>General: Asteroid Blast Could Spur Atomic War</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Asteroids regularly explode over the Earth with the intensity of a
nuclear bomb, and there is a chance the explosions could be mistaken
for a nuclear attack, possibly triggering an atomic war, an Air Force
general said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   At least 30 times a year, a space rock measuring a few yards
across slashes into the atmosphere and explodes, releasing energy
equal to that of an atomic bomb, Brig. Gen. Simon P. Worden told
members of a House science subcommittee.</LD>
<LD>   Worden, deputy director for operations of the U.S. Strategic
Command, said the U.S. has satellite instruments that determine
within a minute whether the blast is a nuclear weapon or a natural
explosion from an asteroid.</LD>
<TE>   But no one else has such technology, he said, and without it, some
countries could conclude the explosions came from a nuclear bomb and
could launch an atomic attack against an enemy.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, he said Pakistan and India, both of which have
nuclear capabilities, were at full alert in August, poised for war.</TE>
<TE>   Not far away, a few weeks before, Worden said, U.S. satellites
detected over the Mediterranean an atmospheric flash that indicated
"an energy release comparable to the Hiroshima burst." Air Force
instruments quickly determined that it was caused by an asteroid 15
feet to 30 feet wide.</TE>
<TE>   The blast received little or no notice, he said, but it possibly
could have caused a major human conflict had it occurred over India
or Pakistan while those countries were on high alert.</TE>
<TE>   "The resulting panic in the nuclear-armed and hair-triggered
opposing forces could have been the spark that ignited a nuclear
horror we have avoided for over half a century," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Worden said the Air Force's early warning satellites in 1996
detected an asteroid burst over Greenland that released energy equal
to about 100,000 tons of explosives. He said similar events are
thought to have occurred in 1908 over Siberia, in the 1940s over
Central Asia and over the Amazon basin in the 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   "Had any of these struck over a populated area, thousands and
perhaps hundreds of thousands might have perished," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Worden said the current generation of early warning satellites
does a good job of detecting asteroid bursts in the atmosphere and
that new equipment will be even better. He said the Air Force is
working on an asteroid alert program that would quickly send
information from the satellites to interested nations.</TE>

<HD>Latino Voters Not of Single Mind, Poll Finds</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A majority of Latino voters identify as Democrats, but they show
significant ambivalence toward the party, suggesting a growing
electorate that may be up for grabs, according to a national survey
of 1,329 registered Latino voters by the Pew Hispanic Center and the
Kaiser Family Foundation.</LD>
<LD>   Latino voters have more confidence in Democrats than Republicans
when it comes to the economy, by a margin of 53% to 27%. But four in
10 say there is no difference between the major political parties.
Those surveyed also demonstrated that Latino voters are unpredictable
when it comes to core beliefs associated with conservatives and
liberals.</LD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The government has created a genetically engineered anthrax vaccine
that promises to cut in half the six shots now needed for protection,
and chosen two biotechnology companies to begin testing it.</LD>
<LD>   The $22.5-million contract award will allow California-based
VaxGen Inc. and Britain's Avecia to test the experimental vaccine on
people to see if it is safe and, if so, to see if it provides
protection against the deadly bacteria.</LD>
<LD>   Federal authorities hope the two companies will pave the way
toward Food and Drug Administration approval for the vaccine.
Eventually, the government wants 25 million doses.</LD>

<LD>Western Shoshone leaders and states' rights advocates plan to picket
a government auction today in Reno of cattle seized from two longtime
tribal activists in a growing dispute concerning treaty rights and
livestock grazing.</LD>
<LD>   It marks the third time in 15 months that the Bureau of Land
Management has confiscated cattle in Nevada for trespassing on
federal land without a grazing permit. Agency officials said the
range is being damaged by overgrazing.</LD>
<LD>   Tribal leaders said they had no immediate plans to ask a court to
block the auction, although they will consider legal action.</LD>

<HD>Judge Hears New Evidence in Buffalo-Area Terrorism Case</HD>
<DH>Court: Audiotapes and papers were seized from the homes of
three of the six suspects linked to Al Qaeda. A ruling on bail is
expected next week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUFFALO, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Sounding deeply ambivalent, a federal judge weighed the significance
of newly discovered audiotapes and documents on Thursday as he neared
a decision on whether to grant bail to six local men charged with
attending an Al Qaeda terrorist training camp last year.</LD>
<LD>   "I do want to get this decision out because, in fairness to all,
we cannot continue to allow it to linger or drag out piecemeal," said
U.S. Magistrate H. Kenneth Schroeder, who plans to rule next week.
The defendants, who have been in custody since Sept. 13, "deserve a
chance" to get the matter expedited, since they are facing potential
jail terms of 15 years, he said.</LD>
<LD>   But in yet another hearing in a federal courtroom here, the judge
seemed caught between prosectors' arguments that the men--all
American citizens of Yemenite descent--pose a genuine threat to the
community, and defense lawyers' contention that their clients are not
flight risks.</LD>
<TE>   Schroeder already had held an extraordinary three-day hearing last
week to hear arguments on a motion to grant bail. But he granted
defense attorneys another hearing Thursday to discuss new evidence
involving the defendants that was presented over the weekend by
federal prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. William Hochul Jr. had filed an affidavit alleging that
papers and audio cassettes taken from the homes of three of the men
contained "highly incendiary" language pertaining to suicide
bombings.</TE>
<TE>   Hochul also said the defendants are flight risks because the
United States does not have an extradition treaty with Yemen, where
many of them have relatives.</TE>
<TE>   The case against the men from Lackawanna, a small steel town south
of Buffalo, is simply "a matter of connecting the dots," Hochul
added. "From day one there was no justification training with Al
Qaeda."</TE>
<TE>   But defense lawyers--and Schroeder--voiced strong doubts about the
government's case. Marianne Mariano, an attorney representing Yahya
Goba, said the religious cassettes taken from his home by government
agents were available to anyone in a store affiliated with the
Lackawanna mosque, and he added that "there is nothing that is
anti-American, that incites or advocates violence against America" in
them.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder, nodding in agreement from the bench, said: "At best, I
can say it [the audiocassette evidence] is now ambiguous."</TE>
<TE>   James Harrington, attorney for Sahim Alwan, said other tapes taken
from his client's home deal with religious issues. For example, "The
Future of the Islamic Nation," a Jordanian tape made around the time
of the Persian Gulf War, was a lecture about the Palestinian drive
for a homeland, and another tape chronicled Palestinian grievances
against Israel, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I wonder what I would do if the government came into my house and
saw books that I have," Harrington said. "They could be twisted by
someone into being radical or anti-American."</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder seemed to shift directions, however, when Rodney
Personius, representing Yasein Taher, defended a document about the
mechanics of suicide bombings that FBI agents seized from his
client's home.</TE>
<TE>   Personius said prosecutors quoted inflammatory language from a
small segment of the document and ignored the fact that it was
written about the Islamic militants' battle against Russian troops in
Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a position paper on this issue, written from a religious
perspective," the attorney said. "Mere possession" of such a document
should not permit the government to deny his client bail, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder interrupted him, saying the document "almost reads like,
here's how you go about striking terror in the hearts of people ...
And this now gets us back to the heart of the matter. We can't put
history out of our minds, we do now know that there was a 9/11 event
where people were seeking self-destruction [through bombings] in the
United States."</TE>
<TE>   The judge noted that similar documents were found in the apartment
of Mohamed Atta, the ringleader of the Sept. 11 attacks. And he said
the Lackawanna men who are accused of attending Osama bin Laden's
terrorist camp were young and impressionable.</TE>
<TE>   "The logic of any reasonable person would be, if one is willing to
self-destruct, that person is not going to be constrained by any
[bail] conditions that I impose," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a final comment that seemed to throw both sides off balance,
Schroeder said he was also considering whether the statutory language
under which the six men have been charged--providing "material
support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization"--may be
unconstitutionally vague.</TE>
<TE>   Although the men may have attended the Al Qaeda camp, he said,
that in itself might not constitute evidence of a conspiracy to
commit violence.</TE>
<TE>   "The constitutional issue is at the forefront immediately,"
Schroeder said, before adjourning the hearing. The decision "is not a
no-brainer. There are some very difficult legal questions."</TE>

<LD>Excerpts from the Senate's debate Thursday on President Bush's
request for a broad resolution authorizing the use of military force
against Iraq. The House is expected to begin debate on the resolution
Tuesday. Both chambers are expected to approve the measure next week.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.)</LD>
<LD>   "Saddam Hussein is a brutal, ruthless dictator who has repressed
his own people, attacked his neighbors and remains an international
outlaw. The world would be a much better place if he were gone....
That's why the United States should unite the world against Saddam
Hussein and not allow him to unite forces against us. A go-it-alone
approach, allowing a ground invasion of Iraq without the support of
other countries, could give Saddam Hussein exactly that chance. A
preemptive, go-it-alone strategy toward Iraq is wrong. Only a broad
coalition of nations, united to disarm Saddam, while preserving our
war on terror, is likely to succeed."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jon Kyl(R-Ariz.)</TE>
<TE>   "There are people today who are hoping against hope that Saddam
Hussein will never use these weapons --weapons that are far greater
than anything Adolf Hitler ever had in terms of their potential for
destruction and death. But the idea is that in a war on terror, you
shouldn't have to wait until you're attacked to respond. That creates
too many deaths, too much misery, and is unthinkable after Sept.
11....</TE>
<TE>   "We can't wait until he's hit us to hit him ...."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.)</TE>
<TE>   "The resolution before us today is not only a product of haste; it
is also a product of presidential hubris.... It would give the
president blanket authority to launch a unilateral, preemptive attack
on a sovereign nation that is perceived to be a threat to the United
States.... Think for a moment of the precedent that this resolution
will set, not just for this president but for future presidents.
Congress has a responsibility to exercise with extreme care the power
to declare war. There is no weightier matter to be considered."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Zell Miller (D-Ga.)</TE>
<TE>   "A few weeks ago, we were doing some work on my back porch back
home, tearing out a section of old stacked rocks, when all of a
sudden I uncovered a nest of copperhead snakes.... When I discovered
these copperheads, I didn't call my wife, Shirley, and ask her
advice.... I didn't yell for help from my neighbors or take it to the
City Council. I just took a hoe and knocked them in the head and
killed them.... I guess you could call it a unilateral action.... I
took their poisonous heads off because they were a threat to me. And
they were a threat to my home and my family.... Isn't that what this
is all about?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.)</TE>
<TE>   " ... If we give [Bush] the go-it-alone, preemptive- strike
authority, which I will not vote for, then I think those who are
considering voting for that ought to ask these questions: How many
U.S. troops would be involved? What are the projected casualties?
Would the U.S. have to foot the entire cost of using force against
Iraq? ... What will the costs be to rebuild Iraq? ... What will the
impact be on our fight against terrorism?</TE>
<TE>   " ... Iraq must be held to their word as expressed in U.N.
resolutions that it will submit to thorough inspections and
dismantlement of weapons of mass destruction. Period. That's what
they agreed to and that is what must happen.</TE>
<TE>   "These weapons are a threat to the world and the world must
respond and if we handle this matter right the world will respond.
But if our allies feel that we have not made the case; if they feel
this is political or a grudge match or if they feel that they are
being manipulated for domestic political reasons, that is going to
hurt our nation and isolate us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trent Lott (R-Miss.)</TE>
<TE>   "No one--not the president, not any member of Congress --desires
to see our men and women engaged in a fight in the Middle East. Our
history shows that Americans don't seek war.... There is no greater
force for good than the United States of America, but when our
security and our people are threatened, we act swiftly and
decisively.</TE>
<TE>   "Let there be no mistake, the elimination of the Iraqi threat is
essential if we are to win the war on terror. We know of Saddam
Hussein's ongoing relationship with the dark forces of international
terrorism.... For 11 years, Saddam Hussein has flaunted the will of
the United Nations, he has amassed stockpiles of weapons of mass
destruction. He has gassed his own people. He has shown blatant
contempt for the rule of law and the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   "As we engage in this momentous debate, let us ensure that by its
conclusion, we will have set in motion the beginning of the end of
Saddam Hussein and all that he stands for."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>A fuel tanker rolled off an exit ramp early Thursday and exploded in
the parking lot of a women's jail, igniting several vehicles and
detonating ammunition left in police cars, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The driver of the tanker, Iray Jesus Diaz, 41, of Hialeah, died in
the crash, said Lt. Julio Pajon, a spokesman for the Florida Highway
Patrol. No other injuries were reported.</LD>
<LD>   Diaz, a driver for MDG Trucking of Fort Lauderdale, lost control
of the vehicle while exiting Interstate 95 to Highway 836 shortly
after 3 a.m., Pajon said. The tanker rolled off the ramp and landed
in the lot of the women's annex of the Miami-Dade County Detention
Center, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The fire destroyed or damaged four buses and more than 20 cars.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses reported hearing gunshots when the fire heated rounds of
ammunition left in police cars.</TE>

<HD>Child 'Cured' by Gene Therapy Develops Cancer</HD>
<DH>Science: Leukemia-like illness is found in French toddler,
who was treated for 'bubble-boy' disease. The FDA halts three trials,
including two in L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A French boy who had been considered one of the few people cured by
gene therapy has developed a leukemia-like disease, prompting the
Food and Drug Administration to halt three gene-therapy trials in the
United States. Two of the trials are run by researchers at Childrens
Hospital Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   It is unclear whether the gene-replacement technique caused the
boy's new illness. Still, the incident threatens to further dampen
hopes for gene therapy, which has been under intense scrutiny since
the 1999 death of a teenager in a University of Pennsylvania
experiment.</LD>
<LD>   In gene therapy, healthy genes are placed in a patient's cells in
an attempt to compensate for the faulty genes that cause disease. The
technique is considered one of the most exciting ideas to emerge from
the explosion of information about human genes, with prospects for
treating cancer, hemophilia, AIDS and other ailments.</LD>
<TE>   The French boy, now 3, had undergone the process as an infant to
control "bubble-boy" disease, a rare immune system disorder that is
fatal if untreated. The boy's immune system rebounded, and he was
able to leave a sterile hospital environment--or "bubble"--and live
at home. He was one of four boys included in a French study,
published this spring, that is considered the only definitive proof
that gene therapy can work.</TE>
<TE>   In August, however, doctors found that the boy had developed
cancer in his blood, similar to leukemia. The boy is now being
treated with chemotherapy. It was the first time the illness appeared
in any of the 32 or so patients treated worldwide by gene therapy for
the immune-system disease, including nine other children in the
French study.</TE>
<TE>   Still, FDA officials revealed Thursday that they had halted three
U.S. gene-therapy trials last month, days after learning that French
authorities had stopped trials run by Dr. Alain Fischer and
colleagues at the Necker Hospital for Children in Paris, where the
boy had been treated.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the incident was not made public until Thursday
to give French researchers time to talk with patients before the news
hit the media.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Phillip Noguchi, director of the FDA's Division of Cellular
and Gene Therapies, said 150 or so gene-therapy trials are underway
in the United States. The three suspended trials and the French trial
all target the same disease: severe combined immunodeficiency, or
SCID. Only one of the trials had begun to treat patients.</TE>
<TE>   Noguchi said the FDA did not halt other gene-therapy trials
because "what we've seen so far would say the potential benefits
still outweigh the potential risks in those other trials."</TE>
<TE>   An FDA advisory panel will discuss the issue at a public meeting
next Thursday. Noguchi said the agency had also asked researchers to
talk with patients in several past gene-therapy trials "so that they
are aware of the latest knowledge."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers said it would take more study to determine whether the
blood disease was truly a side effect of gene therapy, and how common
a problem it might be. Scientists in touch with Fischer, the French
researcher, said some preliminary evidence had begun to emerge
linking the therapy and the new disease.</TE>
<TE>   In SCID, which has several causes and occurs in 1 in 75,000
births, the patient's body contains a faulty gene and fails to make
proteins needed to produce immune cells. Immune cells, in turn, fight
disease.</TE>
<TE>   For many patients, the only treatment is a bone-marrow transplant.
However, 80% of patients cannot find a donor with cells that function
well in the patient's body, said Dr. Donald Kohn of Childrens
Hospital Los Angeles, principal researcher in one of the suspended
studies.</TE>
<TE>   A quarter or more of those patients will die, he said, even after
receiving bone-marrow transplants from parents, unrelated people or
siblings who are not a close match.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers want to restore the gene that goes awry in SCID. The
process involves removing some of the patient's bone-marrow cells,
inserting a healthy gene and returning the cells to the body in hopes
that they will produce healthy disease-fighting cells.</TE>
<TE>   In the French experiment, a mouse virus was used to carry the new
gene into the DNA of the bone-marrow cells. The process worked in
nine out of the 10 boys treated so far, say researchers familiar with
the French study.</TE>
<TE>   Many researchers suspect that the virus may have caused a problem
when it carried the new gene into the bone-marrow cells. It may have
turned on a gene that causes cells to proliferate, or turned off a
gene that prevents cells from growing out of control.</TE>
<TE>   W. French Anderson, who in 1990 performed the first authorized
gene-therapy experiment, said researchers have long feared that
adding a gene would cause problems, because there is no way to
control where in the DNA the new gene will land.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not unexpected. We knew it would happen sooner or later,"
said Anderson, now with the University of Southern California's Keck
School of Medicine. "It's what we've been saying for 30 years now:
Gene therapy should only be used in the treatment of serious
diseases, because there are risks."</TE>
<TE>   Kohn said that preliminary research on the French boy's cells
showed that the new gene landed near another gene involved in
leukemia. "But drawing a causal link requires more study," said Kohn,
who is also president-elect of the American Society of Gene Therapy.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer's team analyzed the gene that had been inserted into the
cells, "and it looks perfect," suggesting that the new gene itself
was not the source of the problem, Kohn said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Mark Kay, a professor of pediatrics and genetics at Stanford
University, said researchers would also have to consider the fact
that bone-marrow cells in the patient had been given the task of
producing a large number of immune cells, "and we know that multiple
cell divisions are one of the factors that could lead to cancer. As
the cells divide, there's always the risk of a random mutation
occurring" that results in cancer.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, he speculated, the very task assigned to the
modified bone-marrow cells may have raised the odds of contracting
leukemia. "But there are so many unknown factors that right now, it's
hard to know," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kay said Fischer's work on SCID patients had been "the first study
where it looked like there was substantial clinical benefit from gene
therapy. It was unequivocal. These kids did better. That's why it was
a highly cited trial."</TE>
<TE>   Kohn said four patients had been treated so far in his study. All
had all been examined in recent weeks, he said, and none showed any
leukemia-like symptoms. That study included patients with a type of
the immune disease called SCID-ADA.</TE>
<TE>   A second Childrens Hospital Los Angeles study, as well as one at
the National Institutes of Health, plans to include only patients
with a second form of the disease, called X-linked SCID. The French
study also focused on X-SCID, which affects only boys.</TE>

<HD>Geoghan Named in 17 New Sexual Abuse Suits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>John Geoghan, the defrocked priest and convicted pedophile who cost
the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston $10 million to settle sexual
abuse claims two weeks ago, was named Thursday in 17 new sexual abuse
lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the suits also charge several bishops, including Boston
Cardinal Bernard Law, with negligence for allowing Geoghan to
continue serving as a priest despite repeated accusations that he was
molesting children.</LD>
<LD>   Geoghan is the cleric at the heart of a child sex scandal that has
engulfed the Catholic Church since January, forcing from office
priests and bishops in the United States, Ireland, Poland, Germany
and other countries.</LD>
<TE>   Mitchell Garabedian, the same lawyer who last month signed a
$10-million settlement between the archdiocese and 86 of his clients
who said they were Geoghan's victims, filed the new lawsuits in
Suffolk Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Garabedian, who collected more than $3 million from last month's
settlement, said he has been investigating some of the claims in the
new lawsuits for as long as 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   "The plaintiffs in these cases think the church doesn't really
care at all about these victims, as they didn't care about the
Geoghan 86 victims or any other victims," Garabedian told a news
conference.</TE>
<TE>   The new complaints allege that Geoghan fondled, raped and
otherwise sexually abused the 17 plaintiffs while he was serving at
seven parishes in and around Boston from 1964 to 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Garabedian said that with the 17 new alleged victims, he had now
been approached by 141 people who claimed they were sexually abused
by Geoghan. There are 19 civil cases pending against the priest: the
17 filed Thursday and two filed in June, the lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghan, who is serving a prison sentence for fondling a boy,
faces two other criminal trials stemming from abuse allegations
during his three-decade career in the Boston Archdiocese. And,
Garabedian said, he is investigating three other claims against the
priest.</TE>
<TE>   Donna Morrissey, spokeswoman at the Archdiocese of Boston, said
the church wants to settle all sexual abuse cases fairly.</TE>

<HD>Mother Is Charged With Murder After Girl, 3, Left Strapped
in Car</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>A woman has been charged with murder after allegedly leaving her
3-year-old daughter strapped in a car while at work on the first day
of a new job.</LD>
<LD>   Ashante Burgess, who had Down syndrome, died Wednesday shortly
after arriving at a hospital, where doctors said her temperature was
108.</LD>
<LD>   Nakia Burgess, 28, also has been charged with cruelty to a child.
The woman's attorney, Phinia Aten, said her client left Ashante in
the car because she couldn't find affordable day care.</LD>
<TE>   The attorney said Ashante was playing with a chalkboard the first
time Burgess checked on her. Burgess found her daughter unconscious
around noon, less than 90 minutes after arriving at her job as a
transcriptionist.</TE>
<TE>   "She is extremely remorseful about what happened. This was her
only child," Aten said. "At this point, her life has no meaning to
her."</TE>
<TE>   Burgess wept during a brief hearing Thursday and was placed on
suicide watch at Atlanta-Fulton County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   The high temperature in Atlanta was 85 on Wednesday, but
temperatures inside closed cars can climb much higher. The windows
were open slightly, but the car was exposed to the sun, police said.</TE>

<HD>CIA Chief to Update Lawmakers on Iraq</HD>
<DH>Intelligence: Senators had complained agency was dodging
questions. Concerns include effect on bordering countries of a U.S.
invasion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>CIA Director George J. Tenet agreed to brief key lawmakers on Iraq
today after members of the Senate Intelligence Committee complained
that the agency was refusing to answer important questions about the
effects of a potential U.S. invasion.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of the committee, accused the
CIA on Thursday of "obstructionism" for not producing intelligence
reports concerning issues committee members specifically requested
last month.</LD>
<LD>   Among the issues are what effect a U.S. invasion of Iraq would
have on neighboring countries, and how a military strike might affect
the cooperation of other countries in the war on terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   Lawmakers also asked for an agency assessment of certain White
House plans regarding Iraq, a U.S. intelligence official said, a
politically hazardous task the agency considers inappropriate and
would rather avoid.</TE>
<TE>   Senators, mainly Democrats, said the CIA's failure to provide the
information prevents them from making informed decisions about Iraq
as the Senate debates a resolution that would grant President Bush
authority to launch a military strike.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the moment when we should demand of the intelligence
community total cooperation in assessing the threat," said Sen.
Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), a member of the intelligence committee.
"Congress is being asked to give unilateral authority to attack
another nation."</TE>
<TE>   Durbin said one of his main concerns is whether invading Iraq
would undermine the broader war on terrorism by making other
countries, particularly those in the Middle East, reluctant to
cooperate with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that question has gone unanswered," Durbin said.</TE>
<TE>   The intelligence official, who requested anonymity, said the CIA
is working to comply with lawmakers' requests, and had already
produced a comprehensive report concerning Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction "in record time."</TE>
<TE>   The 90-page report, known as a National Intelligence Estimate, was
delivered to the committee late Tuesday. Lawmakers said it arrived
too late for members to study it before a closed-door hearing
Wednesday on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Durbin said aspects of the report "raised serious questions about
some of the public assertions that have been made by the
administration." He declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers also were miffed that Tenet did not attend Wednesday's
hearing. Instead, members were briefed by CIA Deputy Director John
McLaughlin and Robert Walpole, the national intelligence officer for
strategic and nuclear programs.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. intelligence official said Tenet couldn't attend because
he was needed at a meeting of the national security staff at the
White House. The Senate committee had been notified of that
scheduling conflict days in advance, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   The latest squabble comes when relations between the CIA and
Congress are under significant strain stemming from an ongoing
congressional investigation of intelligence failures surrounding the
Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Tenet fired off an angry letter to Graham and other
committee members after it was disclosed at a hearing that committee
staff had warned lawmakers in private briefing documents that a CIA
witness might "dissemble" when asked certain questions.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's disagreement also reflects the political pressures
surrounding the debate over Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, lawmakers say, they were alarmed to learn that there
was no current National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq. Durbin and
others wrote Tenet asking for a new estimate.</TE>
<TE>   The report delivered Tuesday complied with part of the request.
The agency is also working to produce a second estimate on Iraq's
conventional military forces.</TE>
<TE>   But lawmakers' request that the agency assess White House plans
are more problematic, the U.S. intelligence official said.</TE>
<TE>   "National intelligence estimates are designed to examine the
capabilities, the vulnerabilities of foreign nations," the official
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Not to examine the policies of the United States."</TE>
<TE>   The official stressed that the CIA is willing "to talk about our
role in any possible Iraq action.... But if they're asking us to pass
judgment on the Department of Defense or the State Department, that's
not what we do."</TE>

<HD>Levy Grand Jury Issues Subpoenas</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Friends of man who is key target are called. One
had told of his facial bruises, cut lip.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A grand jury has subpoenaed friends of a man who is now the focus of
the Chandra Levy investigation, among them an apartment manager who
has told the Washington Post that the man had facial scratches and a
cut, swollen lip around the time the former federal intern
disappeared.</LD>
<LD>   Sheila Cruz, the manager of a building where Ingmar Guandique
lived, said she can place the time she saw the facial abrasions as
late April or early May because it was shortly before Guandique, then
19, was arrested May 7, 2001, for breaking into an apartment in the
complex.</LD>
<LD>   Levy, whose remains were found in Rock Creek Park this spring,
disappeared May 1, 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Guandique blamed his wounds on his girlfriend, saying she had hit
him, Cruz said. But the former girlfriend, in an interview, denied
causing the injuries to his face. She said she never saw the
scratches and swollen lip. She described a relationship that was
sporadic.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz was subpoenaed late Wednesday, just hours after she was
interviewed by the Post. Her boyfriend, one of Guandique's friends,
also was subpoenaed.</TE>
<TE>   Guandique's former girlfriend, Iris Portillo, and her mother said
in an interview that they were called to the U.S. attorney's office
last month. Portillo, 20, said she took detectives to a spot in Rock
Creek Park where she had gone with Guandique, less than a mile from
where Levy's remains were found. She said investigators took a gold
bracelet, which she said was a gift from Guandique in early 2001, and
a necklace.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear what jewelry Levy was wearing when she was slain.
Law enforcement sources have said that a gold bracelet and a gold
ring were missing from her belongings.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz said that until this week she had not been contacted by
Washington, D.C., police during the 17-month probe. She is one of
several Guandique friends or relatives who have been subpoenaed in
recent weeks as investigators focus on the Salvadoran immigrant
convicted in September 2001 of assaulting two women jogging in Rock
Creek Park, not far from where Levy's remains were found. The attacks
occurred May 14, 2001, two weeks after Levy disappeared, and July 1,
2001.</TE>
<TE>   The flurry of subpoenas and the grand jury's interest in Guandique
mark a significant change in the Levy investigation, which had
focused on Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres), with whom Levy allegedly
was having an affair when she vanished.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives have no evidence linking Guandique or any other suspect
to Levy's death. Police have sent the clothes Guandique was wearing
when he was arrested July 1, 2001, for the park assaults to the FBI
lab for DNA tests.</TE>

<HD>Lili Puts on Ferocious Show, but Fades Quickly</HD>
<DH>Louisiana: Arriving with 145 mph winds and flooding, the
storm is downgraded from a hurricane by afternoon. No deaths are
reported.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW IBERIA, La.</DL>
<LD>Hurricane Lili pounded to land Thursday, churning the air with
furious winds and stinging rains. Billboards bent clear to the mud,
trees snapped like wooden matches and buildings splintered and flew
to pieces.</LD>
<LD>   Lili was messy, inconvenient and extremely expensive, but it
wasn't nearly as bad as officials feared. "It looks like we were
lucky," Louisiana Gov. Mike Foster said.</LD>
<LD>   Eleven parishes were evacuated. Hundreds of thousands of people
were ordered to seek shelter on higher ground. The hurricane cut
power to more than 200,000 homes and businesses, froze oil production
in the Gulf of Mexico and ground the Bayou State to a halt with
widespread flooding and intense winds.</LD>
<TE>   No deaths were reported.</TE>
<TE>   Just hours before landfall, forecasters clocked winds at 145 mph
and classified Lili as a dangerous Category 4 hurricane. But dry air
and cool waters sapped the storm's strength, and winds knocked the
hurricane out of formation as it reached land.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew some of those factors were there, but we weren't certain
they would lead to such a dramatic weakening at the last minute,"
said Edward Rappaport, deputy director of the National Hurricane
Center in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Lili raged ashore at dawn over Marsh Island, plowed across New
Iberia and stormed onto central Louisiana, growing weaker and wider
as it moved inland. The fiercest winds roared over the coastline at
120 mph, ripping shingles off roofs and flattening sugar cane fields.
A pair of 18-wheelers flipped over on Interstate 10. A communications
tower toppled in Lafayette, and two people were injured when a roof
collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   By late afternoon, Lili had been downgraded to a tropical storm.</TE>
<TE>   When the worst of the storm passed, wary coastal residents
ventured into pelting rain and stiff wind gusts to see the wreckage
left behind. Ancient oaks were shattered. Power lines drooped in lazy
loops onto flooded roadways. Lawns and parking lots were swallowed by
murky waters. The town of Montegut, outside New Orleans, was awash in
3 feet of water.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought, 'Oh it's going to turn.' It's been 10 years since
we've had a bad storm here," said Brenda Renard. "But she just kept
coming in."</TE>
<TE>   Renard, 59, works at the Inn of Iberia, which served as a cramped
shelter for hundreds of coastal residents who delayed their flight
until it was too late to get out. When the winds screamed outside,
families poured frantically into the motel lobby--only to find there
was no room at the inn. "But we couldn't turn them away," Renard
said. "We felt like we had to keep it open for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   So the inn opened up the cavernous banquet halls, and the families
huddled on the tile floors, staring out the windows as signposts,
barbecue grills and basketball hoops soared past. "We saw the entire
top of a building go by," Renard said.</TE>
<TE>   The power in Lafayette blinked off in midmorning, turning the
lobby of the Marriott into a dim, warm cavern. Every room was taken;
guests crowded in the doorways to watch towering pine trees crack and
tumble. Metal signs and window screens skipped along the streets. All
morning long, the gales screamed outside.</TE>
<TE>   Wandering the hotel hallways early Thursday morning, Allen Davis
Sr., a lifelong Louisianan, bumped into a pleasant surprise: His
cousin, Thelma Collins, had taken shelter in the same hotel. "We've
been knowing what to do since we came up," said Davis, 57. "When the
hurricane's coming you got to get out."</TE>
<TE>   The 56-year-old Collins had done just that, abandoning her New
Iberia mobile home to the rages of the storm. The pair stood
chatting, then wandered off.</TE>
<TE>   "It was nice seeing you, baby," said Collins, padding barefoot
back to her room to put on a pot of coffee.</TE>
<TE>   "Same here, sweetheart," Davis called to her retreating muumuu.
Outside, the storm raged on.</TE>
<TE>   The pair grew up in Acadiana, a flat wash of bayous, sugar cane
fields and tangled oak groves. It's home to Tabasco sauce and Creole
cooking and a French that's twisted so far off its vine it's come to
be Cajun, a tongue in its own right.</TE>
<TE>   This smattering of shoreline towns is still home to the
descendants of French settlers who fled Canada to escape the
British--and have been doing battle ever since with the decidedly
inhospitable climes of south Louisiana.</TE>
<TE>   Around here hurricanes are something of a tradition. The climatic
convulsions stitch generations into a continuous line of storm
survivors--and give the third coast an opening to show off its
tongue-in-cheek brand of grit.</TE>
<TE>   When homeowners are through hammering plywood over their windows,
they paint on saucy slogans. "Bring it on Lili," says one. Another,
on a bungalow in New Iberia reads: "Not scared. Not this house. Not
gonna evacuate." And then there was the terse suggestion: "Pray."</TE>
<TE>   "I've been here through 'em all," said Darryl Davis. He and his
wife ignored official pleas to evacuate New Iberia, sat before their
picture windows and watched Lili shred their densely wooded lawn. "My
grandparents lived here and her grandparents too. We worry but we
know what to expect."</TE>
<TE>   In shelters, families gathered in the darkness and spoke of the
storms that have blown through before. They mention the hurricanes by
name--Andrew, Audrey, Hilda.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been living here all my life and I've seen them come and
go," said Marie Herpin, 75.</TE>
<TE>   When Herpin was a girl, her family knew what to do when skies
turned leaden and the winds kicked up: They crawled into the
underground dirt shelters that used to be standard in the homes of
south Louisiana, useful for storing sweet potatoes and riding out the
tempests.</TE>
<TE>   "We were used to that," Herpin said. "And we prayed a lot. My aunt
would walk around with a rosary whenever the storms came in."</TE>

<HD>USDA Investigates Deadly Outbreak of Listeria in Northeast</HD>
<DH>Health: The source of the food-borne illness is still not
known. E. coli is probed in the Midwest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. health and food officials said Thursday that they are
investigating the source of a food-borne listeria outbreak blamed for
at least 20 deaths and 120 illnesses in eight Northeastern states.</LD>
<LD>   In a separate meat contamination probe, Cargill Inc. said the U.S.
Agriculture Department closed its ground beef plant in Wisconsin that
was linked to dozens of illnesses, mostly in the Midwest.</LD>
<LD>   Both cases come at a time when the USDA has been criticized by
lawmakers and consumer groups for failing to police food safety.</LD>
<TE>   In the listeria outbreak, the USDA said its Food Safety and
Inspection Service began "vigorous sampling" of lunch meats and deli
products after illnesses were reported in early September. Most
illnesses were in New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey; however,
Michigan, Maryland, Ohio, Connecticut and Delaware also were
affected.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials have not yet been able to pinpoint whether the
listeria contaminated ready-to-eat meats or other foods such as
seafood, soft cheeses and unpasteurized milk.</TE>
<TE>   "Working with state health officials, FSIS investigators have been
probing every possible lead in an attempt to narrow the list of
possible sources of contamination," FSIS Administrator Garry McKee
said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "Multiple samples have been collected and analyzed, but as of yet,
all have tested negative."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 120 listeria illnesses reported to health officials, 36
were linked through laboratory tests, said FSIS spokesman Steve
Cohen. The 36 illnesses resulted in six deaths.</TE>
<TE>   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it has not yet
determined the strain of listeria that caused the other 14 deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Food contaminated with listeria monocytogenes can cause high
fever, severe headaches and nausea. The disease is especially
dangerous to pregnant women, the elderly and those with weakened
immune systems from cancer or other diseases.</TE>
<TE>   The USDA is responsible for regulating the safety of beef, chicken
and eggs, while the Food and Drug Administration has authority over
most other foods.</TE>
<TE>   In the separate E. coli outbreak, the USDA temporarily shut down
the Cargill plant after its ground beef sickened at least 57 people
in seven states.</TE>
<TE>   Cargill's Milwaukee-based Emmpak Foods, doing business as Peck
Meats, late Wednesday night sharply expanded its recall of ground
beef to 2.8 million pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "USDA has shut the plant down," said Mark Klein, the company's
spokesman. "We are working with USDA to determine what it will take
to reopen it to their satisfaction."</TE>
<TE>   Privately owned Cargill bought Emmpak Foods in August 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Tainted Cargill ground beef was linked to illnesses in Wisconsin,
Minnesota, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, New York and New Jersey, the
USDA said.</TE>
<TE>   The ground beef was produced between Aug. 20 and Aug. 24 and
distributed to grocery stores, hotels, restaurants and other
institutions.</TE>
<TE>   The expanded recall is unlikely to turn up much of the
contaminated meat, Cargill said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are expecting very little product to come back because of the
production times," Klein said. "Most of this has already been
consumed."</TE>

<HD>Youths Charged in Beating Share a Long, Hard Past</HD>
<DH>Crime: Several accused of killing a Wisconsin man lack
fathers and have criminal records.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>One boy said he does not attend school because his mother does not
know where to send him.</LD>
<LD>   Another was arrested for burglary before he was 10. His father is
dead and, at 14, he's a father himself.</LD>
<LD>   A third in the mob of boys accused of beating a man to death with
broomsticks, shovels and poles said he took part because he didn't
want anyone calling him scared.</LD>
<TE>   Seven were charged as adults Thursday with first-degree reckless
homicide. The youngest of those held, a 10-year-old, was charged as a
juvenile with being party to the crime of reckless homicide.</TE>
<TE>   In the days since Sunday's beating, the statements from some of
the boys have shed light on the group.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say the boys hunted down Charlie Young Jr. and beat
him bloody and unconscious outside a home where he sought to escape
them.</TE>
<TE>   The violence started when one of the group threw an egg at Young,
police say. Young then struck the 14-year-old in the mouth, knocking
out a tooth and prompting the group to go after the man.</TE>
<TE>   Young, 36, died Tuesday after he was taken off life support.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had known he was beat that bad, to tell the truth I would
not have touched him at all," wrote the 14-year-old, who said he
retaliated when Young punched him. "I do not want him to die because
my tooth is not more important than his life is. I'm sorry."</TE>
<TE>   The 10-year-old's lawyer, Craig Mastantuono, said the boy should
be released to his parents because he has a stable home and has been
attending school.</TE>
<TE>   "He is in fourth grade," Mastantuono said. "Judge, he can't drive
a car. I doubt that he is a flight risk at all."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Dist. Atty. Joy Hammond said the boy took part in the
attack from beginning to end and reportedly told another boy, "We
went back and beat him some more."</TE>
<TE>   The boy made one brief remark in court: "I don't wanna talk to no
police officers." Judge Tim Witkowiak ordered him detained in a
juvenile facility. According to statements the boys have made to
police, five of their fathers are dead. Another is in prison. Most of
the boys have criminal histories--from curfew violations to
possession of cocaine and a 9-millimeter handgun. Their statements
reveal most grew up in the neighborhood where the beating occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the boys said they participated in the attack because they
were scared of the group.</TE>

<HD>Screenings Ordered for Moussaoui Papers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>One week after releasing papers showing that the U.S. government
mistakenly gave accused Sept. 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui
classified documents, a federal judge on Thursday set up a new system
aimed at preventing such an error again.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema ordered federal prosecutors
and the court-appointed standby lawyers who are assisting Moussaoui
to vet all documents through classification specialists before
sharing them with Moussaoui.</LD>
<LD>   Moussaoui, who is not a lawyer, is representing himself in the
death penalty case. But a team of standby lawyers is on hand to
assist him and to take over if necessary.</LD>
<TE>   Brinkema's order came one week after she unsealed documents
showing that the government gave 48 classified documents to Moussaoui
by mistake over the last few months as part of the huge amount of
evidence turned over to him by the prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   The classified documents--FBI summaries of interviews--then had to
be retrieved during several days of searching Moussaoui's cell.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui complained about the interruption of his trial
preparation, and Brinkema agreed that it was one reason to grant a
new extension of his trial. The trial is now set to start on June 30.</TE>
<TE>   Brinkema's order was filed after a closed hearing Wednesday with
prosecutors and Moussaoui's standby lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   She said the procedures were to be followed "to avoid the
inadvertent disclosure of classified information to the defendant
and/or the public."</TE>
<TE>   The classification specialists to be used by the defense will be
"walled off" from all attorneys and investigators on the prosecution,
Brinkema said.</TE>

<HD>Bratton's Charisma Could Serve Him Well</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Friends and observers of the former New Yorker praise
his managerial skills but say he should cut down on the publicity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>By day, William J. Bratton was a front-page fixture in the mid-1990s,
receiving credit for a plunging crime rate while stealing headlines
from then-Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</LD>
<LD>   By night, Bratton cut a swath through the society columns,
sometimes attending three parties in an evening and hobnobbing
regularly at swank restaurants with the city's cognoscenti.</LD>
<LD>   Friends and observers in both worlds said Thursday that Bratton,
selected by Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn as the city's next police
chief, was a high-wattage personality whose charisma could play well
on the West Coast if he tempered his desire for publicity.</LD>
<TE>   "He's a very nice guy. He knows what he's doing," said Elaine
Kaufman, owner of Elaine's, the fashionable Upper East Side hangout
for celebrities such as Woody Allen, George Plimpton, Alex Baldwin,
Danny Aiello, Gay Talese--and Bratton.</TE>
<TE>   "He is very good at putting people together."</TE>
<TE>   Kaufman plans to throw a goodbye party for Bratton and, as a
homebody who sticks close to New York, said dryly that she will
"visit him out there, if I am in the neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   No farewell soiree is expected from Giuliani, who fired Bratton as
police commissioner in 1996--some say because Bratton beat the mayor
to the cover of Time magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton "did a very good job here," said Paul Chevigny, a law
professor at New York University and a specialist in policing.</TE>
<TE>   "He did such a good job he began to cast a little shadow on
Giuliani's sunlight, and Giuliani got rid of him."</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, Bratton and his wife, Court TV anchor Rikki
Klieman, will keep their Manhattan apartment and country home in
Quogue on Long Island. Klieman, an attorney whom Time called one of
the nation's top female trial lawyers in 1983, plans to remain at her
weekday job in New York, taking the red-eye regularly.</TE>
<TE>   "I like his wife. She is very smart and very sweet," said Jimmy
Breslin, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Newsday columnist, who added
jokingly: "I like her because she likes me."</TE>
<TE>   Breslin said Bratton's departure for the West Coast wasn't causing
much buzz in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "How long has he been commissioner?" he asked, suggesting that
Bratton's 1994 to 1996 tenure was already ancient history to many New
Yorkers.</TE>
<TE>   But Breslin and others said Bratton would be remembered in New
York for conceptualizing and instituting--with a cadre of highly
talented aides--an effective and now widely copied system of
compiling crime statistics at the street level. The program, known as
COMPSTAT, allowed local precinct commanders to quickly assess and
respond to problems.</TE>
<TE>   Crime was cut dramatically as the nation looked on.</TE>
<TE>   "I think his managerial skills were unparalleled in my time. I
think he deserves more credit. I think [Giuliani] deserves credit for
having the good judgment for making him commissioner," said Wayne
Barrett, a senior editor and investigative reporter at the Village
Voice.</TE>
<TE>   Barrett said Bratton's greatest mistake was not following up on
lists of minority candidates for police officers compiled by his
predecessor, Ray Kelly, in the final year of Mayor David D. Dinkins'
administration.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "I think Bratton is really a highly skilled manager and a
very take-charge guy," Barrett added. "He would have been police
commissioner [again] had Mark Green won."</TE>
<TE>   Green, the Democratic candidate for mayor, was defeated by Michael
Bloomberg in last year's election.</TE>
<TE>   Chevigny, however, said that Bratton faces a "daunting job" as an
outsider trying to lead the LAPD, which has been scarred by scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "He faces a recalcitrant department sunken in its own folkways
that seems strangely to have public support while it is in an
incredibly difficult situation," Chevigny said.</TE>
<TE>   The NYU professor added that a major challenge facing Bratton
would be finding and developing talent in the department able to cope
with a host of problems.</TE>
<TE>   There's also the matter of Bratton's style.</TE>
<TE>   People who praise his diligence and ability to innovate believe he
should curb his appetite for attention.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd say to him, cut down a little on the publicity," Breslin
advised. "When the red light on a television camera goes on, it
changes the formation of Bratton's brain"--a common malady, the
columnist added.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Levitt, Newsday's expert on the New York police, agreed
that, at times, Bratton has difficulty "resisting the blandishments
of celebrity." He said that, in Los Angeles, this could overshadow in
the mind of the public Bratton's considerable ability to innovate and
willingness to take risks in his new job.</TE>
<TE>   "He tried to include the brass" when he implemented change, Levitt
said, describing Bratton's style when he headed the NYPD. "He had
Jack Welch down from [General Electric] to talk-to-the-manager
seminars. Henry Kissinger was speaking to some business group that
Bratton helped organize. He was a terrific networker.</TE>
<TE>   "He was never happy being in the private sector," Levitt added,
referring to Bratton's years after being commissioner. "He missed
being a public figure and being recognized on the street. He loved
being the center of things."</TE>
<TE>   But, Levitt cautioned: "He can't stay away from the TV lights. He
is like a moth to a flame."</TE>

<HD>West Nile-Tainted Breast Milk Likely Infected Baby, CDC
Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Federal health officials said Thursday that a Michigan infant has the
West Nile virus and probably got it from the breast milk of his
infected mother.</LD>
<LD>   The child is healthy and his mother is recovering, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention said. The CDC said it was virtually
certain the virus came from breast milk, although there is no way to
be sure.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors stressed that breast milk is the most healthful food for
babies and that mothers shouldn't quit nursing because of West Nile
fears.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, when the case was being investigated, the CDC urged new
mothers with the virus to talk with their doctors about whether to
continue breast-feeding.</TE>
<TE>   West Nile is rare in infants because they spend little time
outdoors and because the virus is usually spread by mosquito bites.</TE>
<TE>   The 40-year-old Michigan mother gave birth Sept. 2, and she
received a blood transfusion that day and the next. She went home
with her baby Sept. 4, only to be hospitalized on Sept. 17 for three
days.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors later confirmed she had West Nile.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear how the mother became infected, but it may have
been from the blood, the CDC said. She and another patient received
blood from a common donor, and remaining blood samples from that
donor have shown signs of contamination.</TE>
<TE>   The virus has infected 2,530 people in 32 states so far this year
and killed 125, the CDC said.</TE>

<HD>5 Shot Dead in Suburban D.C. as Fear Spreads</HD>
<DH>Crime: The seemingly random killings unfold over a 16-hour
span. Police in Maryland are looking for two suspects in the sniper
attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GETTER, VICKI KEMPER and JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KENSINGTON, Md.</DL>
<LD>Five people were shot to death Wednesday and Thursday in a series of
seemingly random attacks that shocked the middle-class suburbs of
Washington, sending police swarming onto streets and highways in a
frantic search for a small white cargo truck carrying two suspects.</LD>
<LD>   The shootings occurred within a 16-hour period that started
Wednesday night and continued into the morning rush hour Thursday,
spreading alarm through an enclave of bustling shopping centers and
quiet neighborhoods of Montgomery County, Md., about 10 miles north
of the White House. As the drama unfolded, school officials kept
children indoors and frustrated police appealed to the public for
help.</LD>
<LD>   The victims--three men and two women--each were killed by one
bullet, possibly fired at some distance by a skillful, elusive
shooter, police said. The killings all occurred within a few miles of
each other. The victims--a mix of ages, races and sexes--died at the
scene or on their way to the hospital, police said.</LD>
<TE>   "We do have someone who has so far been very accurate," said
Montgomery County Police Chief Charles A. Moose. "We feel like we
have a skilled shooter. That does heighten our concerns."</TE>
<TE>   The shooter or shooters remained at large Thursday night, despite
a massive dragnet in which white trucks--the type of vehicle
described by a witness--were pulled over all day long throughout the
Washington area. Police from Montgomery County and neighboring
counties, and Maryland state police, were aided by the FBI, the
Secret Service and other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "I am absolutely convinced that someone saw something," Moose
said, urging members of the public to call in with tips. "This is not
some lightning bolt from the sky. Someone knows."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether investigators were considering the possibility of
terrorism, the chief said: "We are not closing any avenue. We are a
large suburban community adjacent to the nation's capital. We
understand what that can mean."</TE>
<TE>   From each crime scene came stories of people gunned down during
the most mundane acts of suburban life:</TE>
<TE>   About 6 p.m. Wednesday, James D. Martin, 55, was hit by a bullet
in a grocery store parking lot. James L. "Sonny" Buchanan, 39, was
shot about 7:40 Thursday morning while pushing a lawn mower behind an
auto dealership. About half an hour later, Premkumar Walekar, 53, a
cabdriver who had just bought a lottery ticket, newspaper and pack of
gum, was killed while pumping gas.</TE>
<TE>   Less than an hour after that, Sarah Ramos, 34, was shot while
sitting on a bench in front of a chicken restaurant near the Leisure
World retirement community. Just before 10 a.m., Lori Ann
Lewis-Rivera, 25, a nanny, was gunned down while vacuuming her
employers' maroon van at a service station. She was married with a
3-year-old daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The very randomness of the shootings rattled the normally upbeat
community: "All these things done were things that we do," said Judy
Laurenson, who came to pick up her 4-year-old son from pre-school
after hearing about the rampage. "We all vacuum our cars. We all get
gas. We all go shopping and mow our lawns. We could have been there
....It's just really sad."</TE>
<TE>   One witness told police he saw a white van with two occupants
racing away from one of the crime scenes--a shopping center near
Leisure World. Soon after, law enforcement officials announced that
they were looking for a "white cargo van"--later amended to a "white
box truck"-- with black lettering on the side and a damaged rear
gate, possibly manufactured by Isuzu or Mitsubishi.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the tense day, police stopped small white trucks--"too
many to get an accurate count," according to one official--and at one
point closed a section of Interstate 95. The public inundated
emergency phone lines with tips.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials were proceeding on the assumption that
the killings were related, that the victims were randomly selected
and that the shooter may have fired with skill at some distance,
possibly from across nearby parking lots.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all concerned," Moose said at one point. "We're all
fearful. We don't know what we have at this point." Officials later
said that the county's murder rate had increased by 25% in only 20
hours.</TE>
<TE>   According to police, the spree began with a shot into a Michaels
craft store on Wednesday night, the only bullet that did not hit
someone. Instead, it came blasting through the front window, passed
over the head of a cashier, ripped through an advertising sign and
ricocheted off a metal rack that holds books of inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   "At first I thought I broke a piece of glass," recalled Ann
Chapman, 43, the cashier. "It sounded like an M-80 going off in here.
It went like 'Pow!' I thought it was the light breaking. There was
smoke and everything."</TE>
<TE>   About 40 minutes later, Martin was shot in a parking lot as he
walked toward a Shoppers Food Warehouse grocery store.</TE>
<TE>   But it was not until Thursday morning that police considered that
a grim pattern was taking shape.</TE>
<TE>   With the shooter or shooters on the loose, school officials in the
county declared an emergency, locking doors, taking extra attendance
periodically, canceling outdoor activities, restricting hallway
travel and in some cases herding children into classrooms with shaded
windows.</TE>
<TE>   Students were told "everyone's safe, and it's another sunshiney
day here at Parkwood," said John Ceschini, principal of Parkwood
Elementary, about six blocks from one of the shootings.</TE>
<TE>   School activities and student movements were also restricted in
nearby Frederick and Prince George's counties, Md., and in Arlington
County, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Police, meanwhile, struggled to solve the mystery, examining crime
scenes and studying maps for clues about the shooter's movements.
They also took videotape from the Shoppers Food Warehouse parking
lot. While few witnesses saw the shootings, many saw the victims
sprawled out immediately afterward and recalled the disturbing
events.</TE>
<TE>   At a Mobil gas station, employees recalled Walekar's last moments.
A native of India, he had recently retired from another job and was
driving a taxi full time.</TE>
<TE>   Walekar bought a few items, including $5 in gas at pump No. 7. He
stopped off at the bathroom. "Minutes later he was dead," said
Elizabeth Rosales, the cashier.</TE>
<TE>   The slain driver's family discovered something might be wrong
Thursday morning when Walekar's daughter heard a news report about
the shooting of a cabdriver. Unable to reach her father, she drove to
the service station and recognized her father's car there.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Thursday night, Vijay Walekar described his
brother as "a hard-working person who loved his kids and wife."
Walekar, married for 25 years, had a daughter, 23, and a son, 22.</TE>
<TE>   Others also were grieving. A crying woman who answered the
telephone at Martin's home said his family would have nothing to say
about him for a couple of days.</TE>
<TE>   But the shockwaves spread far beyond the immediate families, with
residents frightened not only by the random nature of the attacks but
also by their efficiency. Business was unusually light near the
multiple crime scenes; some stores shut down for the day.</TE>
<TE>   "Out of the blue these things keep happening," said Alex
Millhouse, a technician at the Mobil station who was using a pay
phone at the time. "The thing that frightens me is we don't know who
did it."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Owens, an engineer at a research center, said he had just
mailed a letter when he heard a sound he initially thought was a
backfire. He returned to work, and only later heard from others in
the neighborhood that a man mowing grass had stumbled and collapsed
after being fatally wounded.</TE>
<TE>   "The poor man just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong
time," said Owens, a hunter who speculated that a sharpshooter might
have pulled the trigger. "Had I stayed out there a minute longer, it
could have been me."</TE>
<TE>   At the shopping center near Leisure World, where Ramos was shot
while sitting in front of Crisp &amp; Juicy Charbroiled Chicken, a pile
of red rose bouquets grew throughout the day.</TE>
<TE>   Right behind the bench, a bullet had left a gash in the restaurant
window.</TE>
<TE>   An 8-year-old boy arrived with his parents to lay down one of the
bouquets and say a prayer. They did not know the victim.</TE>
<TE>   "The shootings make me feel scared, 'cause I'm afraid I'm going to
be next," said the boy who identified himself only as Jordan.</TE>

<HD>N.J. Election Dispute Goes to High Court</HD>
<DH>Politics: The GOP seeks reversal of an 'unfair' ruling that
allowed Democrats to make a preelection switch of Senate candidates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Two years after the Supreme Court sided with the GOP in the disputed
presidential race, the justices now must decide whether to intervene
on behalf of New Jersey Republicans in a race that could decide which
political party controls the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for GOP Senate candidate Doug Forrester urged the high
court Thursday to reverse a ruling of the state's judges and to block
New Jersey Democrats from switching Senate candidates just a month
before the election.</LD>
<LD>   It is "fundamentally unfair," they said, to allow the "party
bosses" to bring in a fresh candidate to replace a sure loser. They
also accused New Jersey's highest court of "amending the law to
endorse their partisan manipulation."</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.), tainted by scandal and
sinking in the polls, announced that he was dropping his reelection
bid. A day later, New Jersey's Democratic leaders chose former Sen.
Frank R. Lautenberg to run in his place. The New Jersey race is one
of several critical in the parties' battle for control of the Senate,
where the Democrats have a one-seat advantage.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered that
Lautenberg's name replace Torricelli's on the state ballot, although
the Democrats were ordered to pay $800,000 to cover the cost.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey election law describes the procedures for replacing a
candidate "in the event of a vacancy ... which shall occur not later
than the 51st day before the general election."</TE>
<TE>   The Democrats switched candidates 33 days before the election, but
the state judges upheld the move because it would give the voters "a
full and fair ballot choice." In a brief opinion, the judges
explained that the 51-day rule was intended to further "the orderly
administration of an election," and that an orderly election can be
held even with the late switch on the Democratic side.</TE>
<TE>   The New Jersey high court is known as a rather liberal court, even
though six of its seven justices were named by then-Gov. Christie
Whitman, a Republican.</TE>
<TE>   In their appeal Thursday, the GOP lawyers said the state court
decision "threatens to change the face of American politics....
Prompt action from this court is required to prevent growing public
cynicism regarding even-handed application of election law rules."</TE>
<TE>   And lest the justices have forgotten, Thursday's appeal recalls
that the high court intervened "in very similar cases arising out of
election disputes in Florida."</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court had no response to the emergency appeal filed at
midday Thursday. If the justices see merit in the claim, they are
likely to ask for a quick response from the Democratic side. It was
unclear when the justices might act. It takes a vote of five
justices--a majority--to block a lower court's order.</TE>
<TE>   In December 2000, the Supreme Court surprised many legal experts
by intervening twice in the Florida recount in the presidential
election.</TE>
<TE>   In one unanimous decision, the justices faulted the Florida
Supreme Court for having extended the deadline for counties to submit
their votes.</TE>
<TE>   And in a subsequent ruling in Bush vs. Gore, the justices, on a
5-4 vote, stopped a statewide hand recount of punch-card ballots on
the grounds that it could be unfair to then-Texas Gov. George W.
Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The New Jersey dispute has several parallels to the Florida
litigation. In both, the Republicans argued that the Democrats were
seeking to change the rules in the midst of an election battle.</TE>
<TE>   "What the Democrats have done is clearly illegal. They are
attempting to steal an election they could not win," said Sen. Bill
Frist (R-Tenn.), who heads the Republican Senatorial Campaign
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   They also argued that the state Legislature sets the rules, not
the state courts. They point to the clause in the U.S. Constitution
that says "the Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for
Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by
the Legislature thereof."</TE>
<TE>   Just as in Bush vs. Gore, the court is "confronted with the
situation of a state Supreme Court rewriting an express statutory
scheme," the Republicans said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   However, the New Jersey case--also like the Florida disputes--puts
the Republicans in the somewhat awkward position of urging federal
judges to second-guess a state court's interpretation of state law.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, conservatives have faulted federal judges for
intervening in state affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the Republicans are urging Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft to
enter the case on their side. They say the last-minute switch by the
Democrats violates the federal law that regulates absentee ballots
for overseas citizens and military personnel, and that Ashcroft
should intervene to defend the law.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials had no comment on the request.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts said Thursday that they were wary of predicting what
the Supreme Court might do.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a pretty strong argument to say the New Jersey Supreme
Court made up this rule, and that Bush vs. Gore says you can't do
that," said UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh. "I would be surprised
if they took it, but I was surprised by Bush vs. Gore."</TE>
<TE>   "If it was five years ago and you asked me about the Republican
position, I would say it's frivolous," said Georgetown University law
professor Mark Tushnet. State courts routinely interpret state law,
he said. "But after Bush vs. Gore, who knows?"</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the New Jersey judges and the Supreme Court clashed
over a gay-rights case.</TE>
<TE>   The state's judges, citing a New Jersey anti-discrimination law,
said the Boy Scouts violated the law by dismissing James Dale, a
well-regarded scoutmaster who acknowledged he is gay.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court reversed that decision on a 5-4 vote and said
the Scouts have a constitutional right to exclude gays.</TE>

<LD>A federal judge Thursday set an Oct. 7, 2003, trial date in the
widely watched case of a New York defense lawyer charged with helping
a militant Islamic cleric direct terrorists from his prison cell.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge John Koeltl said he was allowing the lengthy
trial preparation period because of the complexity of the case
against defense lawyer Lynne F. Stewart, who was indicted in April.
He also cited the massive amount of government evidence to be

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A measure to give President Bush broad authority to launch an attack
on Iraq began to advance in Congress on Thursday, as the resolution
was approved by a House committee and the Senate opened a potentially
divisive debate on the issue.</LD>
<LD>   Final votes approving the resolution are expected next week. But
in the Democrat-controlled Senate, Bush's allies and his adversaries
began to spar over how the United States and the international
community should respond to what the White House has argued is the
threat posed by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his suspected
weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   "Today, we begin the process of ensuring that this violent and
cruel man can no longer menace us, his neighbors and his own people,"
Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said as the debate
formally began. "Let there be no mistake, the elimination of the
Iraqi threat is essential if we are to win the war on terrorism."</LD>
<TE>   Some influential Senate Democrats immediately questioned whether
Bush has made the case that Iraq poses an imminent threat. They
prepared to propose alternative resolutions and to use the debate to
focus public attention on the potential risks and costs of Bush's
initiative against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "As sure as the sun rises in the east, we are embarking on a
course of action with regard to Iraq that, in its haste, is both
blind and improvident," said Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.). "We are
rushing into war without fully discussing why, without thoroughly
considering the consequences, or without making any attempt to
explore what steps we might take to avert conflict."</TE>
<TE>   But even dissenting Democrats say they expect Bush to prevail in
the House and Senate. "The train left the station," said Sen. Joseph
R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.).</TE>
<TE>   That much had become clear on Wednesday, when the White House and
a bipartisan group of congressional leaders endorsed a compromise
resolution authorizing Bush to launch a unilateral, pre-emptive
military strike against Iraq if he concludes that diplomatic efforts
to deal with Baghdad have proved fruitless.</TE>
<TE>   The compromise would grant Bush the key powers he sought. In
return, he agreed to certify to Congress that military action came
only after he had exhausted diplomatic options, and that an attack on
Iraq would not set back ongoing efforts to combat terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The sense of inevitability about the outcome took some drama out
of the Senate debate, which opened in a halting fashion Thursday. The
debate was delayed and interrupted periodically by consideration of
other legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The issue probably will not be joined in earnest until next week,
because many lawmakers will be out of town today for the funeral of
Rep. Patsy T. Mink (D-Hawaii). Neither the compromise resolution nor
any alternatives are expected to come to a vote before Tuesday or
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) did not join other
leaders in endorsing the compromise resolution and has said he wants
to impose further restrictions on Bush's war-making powers.
Nonetheless, Daschle tried to open Senate debate on a conciliatory
note.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be differences of opinion expressed, but there is no
difference of opinion with regard to our ultimate goal," he said.
"Our goal is to address the very understandable and serious concern
shared not only by the administration but the American people that we
have to address the threat that exists in Iraq today."</TE>
<TE>   In the House, the International Relations Committee cast the first
formal votes Thursday on the compromise resolution. It was approved
by a resounding bipartisan vote of 31 to 11. That clears the way for
the measure to go before the full House on Tuesday, with a final vote
expected Wednesday or Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, Daschle said he wanted to structure debate around
three proposals:</TE>
<TE>   * The Bush-backed resolution.</TE>
<TE>   * An alternative by Biden and Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) that
would allow force to be used only to disarm any weapons of mass
destruction Iraq might have, not the broader goal of regime change
that Bush has advocated. It also would put increased emphasis on
securing international support, but would allow unilateral action by
the United States if the U.N. fails to act.</TE>
<TE>   * A resolution by Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) that would authorize
the use of military force against Iraq only in conjunction with the
United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   As Levin introduced his resolution, he argued that Congress should
not decide whether to take unilateral action against Iraq without
first exerting maximum pressure on the U.N. to join in such an
effort. "We don't need to make the decision to go it alone at this
time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Biden-Lugar alternative is considered a more formidable
challenge to Bush's policy. The choice between the two focuses on the
question of what the United States is trying to accomplish: depose
Hussein or eliminate Iraq's potential or capacity to produce and
deploy weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bush has often said the ultimate goal of U.S. policy is
regime change, he has in recent days stressed the goal of disarming
Iraq-- a move apparently aimed at winning broader support in the
U.N., where many countries are wary of trying to topple the leader of
a sovereign nation.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the Bush-backed resolution may be a minority in the
Senate, but they were the first to seize the floor Thursday. Among
them was Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who said she supports the
Levin alternative and argued that Bush has left too many questions
unanswered in a potential war with Iraq to justify a unilateral
attack.</TE>
<TE>   "I need my questions answered before I could vote to send this
country alone into battle," Boxer said.</TE>
<TE>   "How many U.S. troops would be involved? What are the projected
casualties? Would the U.S. have to foot the entire cost?"</TE>
<TE>   Most of the skeptics who spoke were Democrats, but Republican Sen.
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania also sounded a note of caution.</TE>
<TE>   He raised questions about whether Congress should be voting now to
authorize a war that Bush says he has not yet decided to wage.</TE>
<TE>   "The circumstances may change in a matter of months or ... even a
matter of days," said Specter, who did not say how he would vote on
the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Some other senators are still weighing their position. Sen. Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.) said that the Biden-Lugar proposal is her "first
preference" because it narrows the purpose of military action to
disarmament. But she said she has not decided how she would vote if
that alternative is rejected or not offered.</TE>
<TE>   A version of the Biden-Lugar amendment was rejected by the House
International Relations Committee on Thursday, 26 to 16.</TE>
<TE>   In the final committee vote on the Bush-backed resolution, only
two of the 11 opponents were Republicans--Reps. James A. Leach of
Iowa and Ron Paul of Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Among the Californians on the committee, only Grace F. Napolitano
(D-Norwalk) voted against the resolution. Voting for it were Howard
L. Berman (D-Mission Hills), Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), Tom Lantos
(D-San Mateo), Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), Ed Royce
(R-Fullerton), Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) and Brad Sherman (D-Sherman
Oaks).</TE>
<TE>   Reps. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) and Barbara Lee (D-Oakland)
were absent, but said they would have voted no.</TE>

<HD>Wellstone's Beliefs May Imperil His Political Career</HD>
<DH>Profile: Eleven years ago his Gulf War opposition drew
rebukes. Now, Minnesota senator's reelection is at stake over his
antiwar stance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE FIORE and STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Even before Paul Wellstone was sworn into office 11 years ago as a
U.S. senator from Minnesota, he staged several protests to a brewing
Persian Gulf War that perturbed veterans, annoyed the vice president
and prompted then-President George Bush to dismiss him as, to put it
mildly, poultry droppings.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the liberal Democratic lawmaker is poised to again oppose
what he sees as a rush to war with Iraq. But this time, the
consequences of his convictions stand to cost him more than a
presidential rebuke.</LD>
<LD>   Wellstone is locked in one of country's tightest Senate races,
challenged by a charismatic former mayor of St. Paul who supports the
authorization for a war that Wellstone, on Thursday, went on record
as opposing.</LD>
<TE>   "Acting now on our own might be a sign of our power," Wellstone
said from the Senate floor, "but acting sensibly and in a measured
way in concert with our allies ... would be a sign of our strength."</TE>
<TE>   The decision to oppose a resolution granting presidential
authority for a preemptive strike against Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein did not come without some agonizing. With two terms behind
him, Wellstone is hardly the fervent peacenik who exploded onto the
Washington landscape in 1991. Now he is a 58-year-old man caught
between an antiwar pedigree and the desire for a third term. And the
swing voters he needs to win are not likely to warm to tie-dyed
liberalism.</TE>
<TE>   "There is lots at stake," Wellstone conceded as he boarded the
sleek subway from the Senate chamber back to his office. "I was asked
this morning if this would hurt me politically. I don't have any
idea. But what would hurt me for sure would be to utter words on the
floor of the Senate that I don't believe or to vote for something I
am against, especially on a question of life and death."</TE>
<TE>   For Democrats running in tight races in states that President Bush
carried in 2000, the political choice is clear: Support the
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   But Wellstone's constituency is split. Minnesota is not the
liberal bastion it was in the days of former Vice President Hubert H.
Humphrey. It is quirky, the state that made a professional wrestler
its governor. Its party loyalty is divided in thirds among
Republicans, Democrats and independents. And however Wellstone votes
on the subject of Iraq is likely to bring political trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real gut check, definitely a tough vote for him," said
Lawrence Jacobs, a political science professor at the University of
Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone, Jacobs explained, has challengers on his right and his
left. Opposing the war could turn some voters to Republican Norm
Coleman, who as St. Paul's mayor brought hockey back to the city.</TE>
<TE>   But supporting the war could energize the so-far lackluster
candidacy of the Green Party's Ray Tricomo, siphoning off just enough
votes to cost Wellstone his seat.</TE>
<TE>   Despite careful deliberation in recent days--Wellstone talked at
length with his advisors, his wife and three grown children--some
experts believe his only choice was to oppose a "go-it-alone" march
to war.</TE>
<TE>   His track record on the use of military force is long and
well-documented, pre-dating even his notorious debut as the newly
minted senator who pestered the president.</TE>
<TE>   Before his election, Wellstone taught a course called Social
Movements and Grassroots Organizing at Carleton College in
Northfield, Minn., essentially instruction in the mechanics of
political protest.</TE>
<TE>   A quick-witted ex-wrestler who stands 5-foot-5, he has made his
reputation in Washington less as a war protester than as Everyman's
advocate, the champion of underdogs.</TE>
<TE>   To suddenly support Bush's bid for broad authority to move against
Iraq, experts said, would have seemed out of character at best,
unprincipled at worst.</TE>
<TE>   "If he abandons what should be a clear position, that opens up
questions about character that are much more important than any
single vote," Jacobs said.</TE>
<TE>   Polls show his race with Coleman close and the electorate
unpredictable, making it hard to foresee how Wellstone's position
will play with voters.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has not been a front-burner issue in the campaign--indeed, a
greater problem for Wellstone has been his broken promise to retire
after two terms.</TE>
<TE>   But a recent statewide survey suggested Wellstone may be in step
with the majority when the Iraq question is raised, with 58% opposed
to unilateral action by the United States. And in Minnesota on
Thursday, some voters applauded the senator's call for restraint.</TE>
<TE>   Don Murray, 80, was playing cards in a senior center in the little
town of Milaca. "We better stop old George before he starts getting
everyone killed," he said of the president. "Maybe I'll even vote for
Wellstone now."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Lee, 42, an economist who was waiting to catch a flight at
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, agreed. "I think it's
important for people to challenge Bush's runaway PR freight train,"
he said. "I'm glad Wellstone is a free spirit and not afraid to
challenge the status quo."</TE>
<TE>   The senator's position, however, did not impress Myron Werley, 49,
a health insurance underwriter. "I wouldn't have voted for him prior
to what he did today," he said, "and this is certainly not going to
change my vote."</TE>
<TE>   Stuart Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst in Washington,
said Wellstone can minimize the fallout from his stand on the Iraqi
resolution, "but he's got to make the case." The key, Rothenberg
said, is for Wellstone to present himself as a seasoned politician
who would endorse military force--but only as a last option.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Wellstone made precisely that argument. He called
Hussein a "brutal, ruthless dictator" and a menace to the world.</TE>
<TE>   But he added: "Our decisions finally must have the informed
consent of the American people, who will be asked to bear the costs
in blood...."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Wellstone seemed comfortable with his decision,
although mindful of its risks. He thanked his staff for never
pressuring him in his deliberations, thus leaving unspoken the
possibility that their jobs were as much at stake as his.</TE>
<TE>   "I was telling my family that here I am, 58 years old, and I've
really tried to always do what I believe is right," he said. "And at
58, I'm not going to change that. I believe this is the right
decision, the right vote."</TE>

<HD>Jury Decides on Death for Serial Killer</HD>
<DH>Court: Robert Lee Yates Jr. is sentenced to lethal
injection for two slayings in Tacoma, Wash., area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TACOMA, Wash.</DL>
<LD>A jury on Thursday sentenced serial killer Robert Lee Yates Jr. to
death by injection for the aggravated murders of two women.</LD>
<LD>   The Pierce County Superior Court jury of seven men and five women
began deliberating late Wednesday. On Sept. 19, the same panel
convicted Yates of murdering Melinda Mercer, 24, in 1997 and Connie
LaFontaine Ellis, 35, in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   The 50-year-old father of five is already serving a 408-year
sentence under a plea agreement two years ago with Spokane County, in
which he admitted murdering 13 other people since 1975. Ten were
women who, like Mercer and Ellis, died after encountering Yates as
prostitutes from 1996 to 1998.</LD>
<TE>   Pierce County prosecutors refused to sign off on the deal, and
brought Yates to Tacoma for trial.</TE>
<TE>   Holly Bartlett kissed a photo of Mercer, her sister, as the jury's
decision was read. Mercer's mother, Karyl Bushell, said she wanted to
hug each member of the jury, and added that she would visit her
daughter's grave today.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very happy about it," she said. "I wanted him to take
responsibility for killing my daughter and Connie."</TE>
<TE>   The verdict brought no discernible reaction from Yates, though his
father, Robert Lee Yates Sr., and sister, Shirley Hess, cried and
comforted each other.</TE>
<TE>   Aggravated first-degree murder is the only crime that carries the
death penalty in Washington state; life imprisonment without parole
is the only other option. Jurors had to be unanimous in ruling for
death.</TE>
<TE>   "He richly deserved the death penalty," said Chief Criminal Deputy
Prosecutor Jerry Costello.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Roger Hunko said he planned to file an appeal as
soon as the sentencing is made official on Oct. 9. It probably would
be at least seven years before a death penalty could be carried out,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors deliberated just over an hour Wednesday before resuming
their work Thursday and reaching their decision just before noon.</TE>
<TE>   The prostitute slayings took place after Yates left the Army and
moved his family to Spokane. His National Guard duties as a
helicopter pilot brought him to the Tacoma area during that time.</TE>
<TE>   "The world is a frightening place, and I've made it more so for
many," Yates told jurors Wednesday, before deliberations began.
"Hundreds of people are hurting and grieving because of my actions."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Mayor Appeared to Supply Ammo in '69 Riots, Witness Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN BRAUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YORK, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Former York Mayor Charlie Robertson chanted "white power" at a 1969
rally of white street gang members, and minutes later appeared to
hand one youth a package of rifle ammunition, a police official
testified Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Robertson and two former gang members are on trial in the killing
of Lillie Belle Allen, a black South Carolina woman gunned down in an
ambush of a car that strayed into the gang's territory during race
riots that ravaged York 33 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Robertson, a policeman at the time, was one of the first officers
to reach the scene after Allen was slain July 21, 1969, in an
eruption of gunshots, said East Pennsboro Township Police Chief
Dennis McMaster, who worked with Robertson inside an armored vehicle
during the riots. McMaster likened the deafening volley of shotgun
and rifle fire to the sound of "the first day of deer season."</LD>
<TE>   The day before Allen's killing, McMaster said, he was surprised to
see Robertson lead a crowd of youths in racist chants at a rally at a
park bandstand. McMaster said he then watched a youth approach
Robertson's squad car and ask for "30.06" rifle ammunition for "home
protection."</TE>
<TE>   McMaster said that he did not see Robertson hand over the
ammunition but that the former mayor was sitting in the front seat.</TE>
<TE>   Another government witness, former Newberry Street gang member
Arthur Messersmith, described a second occasion when Robertson
appeared to offer rifle shells to gang members. But Messersmith, who
has reached a plea bargain with prosecutors to avoid a murder trial,
was unable to finish testifying when defense lawyers objected to
inconsistencies with earlier testimony.</TE>
<TE>   The degree of Robertson's interaction with the gang members is
crucial, because prosecutors acknowledge that he was not on Newberry
Street when Allen was killed. They are trying to use his inflammatory
statements at the time and reports that he provided ammunition to
link him to Allen's killing. Two other men, Robert
Messersmith--Arthur Messersmith's brother--and Gregory Neff, are also
charged with murder.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Flickinger, another former Newberry Street boy, testified
that Robertson suggested in an exchange during the riots that he
would have taken action against blacks if he were not a policeman.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'If I weren't a cop, you know I would be out leading
commando raids against those' " blacks, Flickinger testified. Outside
the courtroom, Flickinger said he interpreted Robertson's comment as
"us against the blacks. It was the mentality of the time."</TE>
<TE>   After the shooting, Robertson was one of several York patrol
officers who arrived on Newberry Street. But McMaster and other
witnesses testified that the officers did little more than call for
an ambulance and order Allen's relatives who were in the car with her
to drive away from the crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   One witness, a former youth counselor named Robert Stoner, said
that while other officers went to the aid of Allen's uninjured
relatives, Robertson was seen talking with several armed youths but
did nothing to confiscate their weapons or investigate the killing.</TE>
<TE>   McMaster also testified Thursday that he found it "eerie" that
York's police commanders sent "no sergeants, no captains, no
detectives" to investigate Allen's death after Robertson and the
other patrolmen left Newberry Street that night.</TE>

<HD>Suicide Lead Cause of Intentional Deaths</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Humans have a remarkable capacity for committing violence against
themselves and others, causing 1.6 million violent deaths a
year--half of those by suicide, according to an exhaustive World
Health Organization study.</LD>
<LD>   Worldwide, someone is a victim of suicide every 40 seconds,
someone is the victim of homicide every 60 seconds and someone dies
in war every 100 seconds, said the report released Thursday in
Geneva. And for every person who dies, 15 to 20 more suffer grievous
physical harm.</LD>
<LD>   The report, which took three years to compile, found enormous
differences in violent deaths across the globe. The murder rate in
Colombia, for example, was nearly 85 deaths per 100,000 people ages
10 to 29, compared to about 1.5 per 100,000 throughout much of
Europe. Researchers found a suicide rate in Lithuania of 52 per
100,000 people, compared to just 5 per 100,000 in Mexico.</LD>
<TE>   The report is the first global survey of human violence by the
WHO, which is urging a more active role by governments in preventing
individual violence.</TE>
<TE>   "Every country is dealing with violence one way or another, but we
are always dealing with it after the fact," said WHO's Dr. Etienne
Krug, who led the effort. "Public health is all about prevention. All
sectors--public health, police, justice--have a role to play in
preventing violence."</TE>
<TE>   "When we are personally confronted by violence, it profoundly
disturbs and unsettles us, yet violence has such a persistent
presence in our society that we often ignore it," WHO
Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland said. "Today, the World Health
Organization sounds the alarm."</TE>
<TE>   The report, in its most surprising finding, estimated that 815,000
people committed suicide in 2000, the most recent year for which data
are available. That makes suicide the 13th leading cause of death
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Suicide occurs most commonly among the elderly and is three times
more likely among men than women--with one major exception: China. In
China, 1.6 women kill themselves for every man who does so and the
country, with 20% of the world's population, accounts for 55% of
female suicides globally. The report suggests cultural factors may
lie at the root of the Chinese suicide problem, but offers no
specific causes.</TE>
<TE>   The suicide rate among the Inuit people of northern Canada was
among the highest in the world, between 60 and 75 per 100,000 people,
compared to 15 per 100,000 in the Canadian population at large. The
United States has a suicide rate of 13.9 people per 100,000
population.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 520,000 people were the victims of homicide in 2000,
and for every person who died, 20 to 40 more were hospitalized, the
report says. That toll included 199,000 people between ages 10 and 29
who were killed by other young people, a disproportionate share.</TE>
<TE>   Among people ages 15 to 44, murder accounted for 14% of deaths
among men and 7% among women. Fighting and bullying are common in
this age group, Krug said, and alcohol and drug abuse and easy access
to firearms play a major role. Homicides in this age group have
soared in the United States, many Latin American countries and the
former Soviet Union, but stabilized or decreased in much of Western
Europe and Canada, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Krug said his group will not lobby for stronger gun controls as
part of its anti-violence programs. "It's not our role," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Almost half the women who are murdered are killed by their current
or former husbands or boyfriends, according to the study. In some
countries, the rate is as high as 70%.</TE>
<TE>   "To many people, staying out of harm's way is a matter of locking
doors and windows," Brundtland said. "To others ... the threat of
violence is behind those doors."</TE>
<TE>   About 57,000 of the homicides in 2000 occurred among young
children, who often died from head injuries or suffocation resulting
from abuse. Studies in several countries also show that about 20% of
women and perhaps half that many men suffered sexual abuse as
children.</TE>
<TE>   In this context, the 310,000 people who died in wars in 2000 seems
almost modest, but the numbers add up quickly to reach truly
staggering figures. In the 20th century, an estimated 191 million
people died as a result of warfare, half of those civilians, the
report says.</TE>

<DH>Hitting of Glaus, Anderson and others might be enough to
rid Anaheim of some nasty postseason demons</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last time the Angels played a postseason game at Anaheim, Troy
Glaus was 10 years old. He was blissfully unaware of the misfortunes
that befell them on Oct. 12, 1986 and of the curse he would be called
upon to end 16 years later in the American League division
series--which didn't even exist then.</LD>
<LD>   "I wasn't really watching," he said of the Angels' American League
championship series against the Boston Red Sox. "I was a baseball
fan, but I was playing."</LD>
<LD>   Now, the entire baseball world is watching the Angels and Yankees
in fascination.</LD>
<TE>   That's because the Angels, who split the first two games of this
series at New York, have a chance to forever silence talk of the
jinxes, curses and bad karma that distinguished their previous
postseason appearances.</TE>
<TE>   They feel no need, though, for an exorcism or cleansing ritual.
Their strategy for shedding the invisible burden of the franchise's
sad playoff history is simple:</TE>
<TE>   To hope Ramon Ortiz (15-9, 3.77 earned-run average) continues to
pitch as well as he did during the final six weeks of the season,
when he won his last six decisions in a span of nine starts. To wear
down Yankee starter Mike Mussina (18-10, 4.05) with patient at-bats
and play with the same intelligent aggressiveness they showed at
Yankee Stadium, where they pounded New York's vaunted pitching staff
for 29 hits, six home runs and a .372 batting average.</TE>
<TE>   To again find the resilience that moved them within four outs of a
victory in Game 1 and to rally for victory in Game 2 after they
squandered a 4-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, to ignore suggestions they're powerless to combat the
ghosts of past Angel playoff disappointments. If they weren't
intimidated by what they could see and feel--stalwart Yankee starters
Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte, the majesty of Yankee Stadium and
the passion of a sellout crowd that rode as one on every dramatic
pitch--why should they be cowed by what they can't see?</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't us," Glaus said Thursday of previous Angel postseason
failures. "Nobody here was there then. These are new guys. We don't
worry about that, and there's no sense worrying."</TE>
<TE>   These Angels, who worked out lightly Thursday at Edison Field,
didn't worry after a 6-14 start that raised questions about Manager
Mike Scioscia's job security, or when the offense paused and they
needed five tries to clinch their playoff berth.</TE>
<TE>   They've never been shaken or stirred. And if that surprises
observers who knew little about them and expected them to quake at
the sight of pinstripes, it's no surprise to them. "Everything on the
East Coast is more magnified," Glaus said. "But the people of New
York know us now, and hopefully they can continue to get to know us."</TE>
<TE>   Still, they have high regard for the Yankees, as they should. The
Yankees were in worse shape after the first two games of their
division series against Oakland last year, losing twice at home
before Mussina won Game 3 and ignited a comeback.</TE>
<TE>   "Over his last half-dozen starts, he's been very, very good,"
Yankee Manager Joe Torre said before his team's optional workout. "We
certainly need a starter to get us late into the game, and we have
the ability to score runs. We just need somebody to shut the other
team down."</TE>
<TE>   But while the Angels acknowledge the Yankees' talent, they weren't
so deferential that they couldn't ride back-to-back home runs from
Garret Anderson and Glaus in the eighth inning Wednesday to a winning
rally, the Yankees' first loss in a playoff game they had led after
seven innings at Yankee Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "Yankee Stadium has got a lot of tradition and we respect that,"
first baseman Scott Spiezio said, "and the fans were electric there.
But this team is all about never giving up until the last out....</TE>
<TE>   "I've been on teams that have won before, but this team is
something special. This is a team that never gives up. We don't have
a lot of superstars but we have a lot of chemistry, and over the last
couple of years, it's just evolved. We've been through a lot lately,
and it would be great if that continues."</TE>
<TE>   Said Torre, who was an Angel broadcaster for six seasons and holds
a place in his heart for late owner Gene Autry: "Yankee Stadium works
as our extra player only if we play well. The fans can be
intimidating, yet they appreciate good baseball. I think they
appreciated what they saw from the Angels.... I credit Mike Scioscia.
His club, they know what they need to do and they've done their job
knowing what was going to take place [in New York]. They certainly
have performed admirably."</TE>
<TE>   The streaky Glaus, only the fourth player to hit three homers in
his first two playoff games, found a power groove late in the season
and hit eight of his 30 homers in September, a single-month high,
including three in one game. He worked with batting coach Mickey
Hatcher to shorten his natural uppercut and improve his timing, and
he's moving his bat more quickly through the strike zone. Hatcher
would like to see him go to the opposite field more often, but
otherwise he's pleased with Glaus' maturation.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to have periods in the year when he's going to
struggle, and times he's going to carry the team," Hatcher said.
"That's what's good about being surrounded by the guys we have. It's
not all on his shoulders."</TE>
<TE>   Glaus, 26, is comfortable shouldering the offensive load. Talking
to reporters, though, makes him fidgety. "We're baseball players, not
media gurus," he said. "We play baseball. Obviously all of the other
stuff goes with it."</TE>
<TE>   There will be a lot of that "stuff" today if the Angels continue
to play as they did in Games 1 and 2. Glaus said he expects Edison
Field to "rock."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "Hopefully, we'll give them a good show. We've given
ourselves a chance. Now we just have to go out and execute."</TE>

<HD>St. Louis Holding All the Aces</HD>
<DH>National League: Cardinals defeat the Diamondbacks, 2-1,
for a 2-0 lead. Rolen is injured, out for series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL ROGERS</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Down goes Johnson. Down goes Schilling.</LD>
<LD>   And, barring a prolonged reversal of fortune that would be as
shocking as the ninth inning of the 2001 World Series, down goes
baseball's defending champion.</LD>
<LD>   By winning games started by heavyweights Randy Johnson and Curt
Schilling, the St. Louis Cardinals have taken the toughest steps
toward advancing to the National League championship series.</LD>
<TE>   Miguel Cairo's ninth-inning single off Arizona reliever Mike
Koplove on Thursday sent the Cardinals home with a 2-1 victory and a
two games-to-none lead in the National League division series.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis needs to win one of the next three games to play for a
pennant against either San Francisco or Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming out of here 2-0 looks very, very good," said Cardinal
left-hander Chuck Finley, who outpitched Schilling. "This was what we
dreamed about doing coming into here."</TE>
<TE>   This is a nightmare scenario for the Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Batista faces the Cardinals' Andy Benes Saturday at Busch
Stadium. Johnson then would face ace Matt Morris in Game 4 with
Schilling set to work on three days' rest in Game 5, if Arizona lasts
that long.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough, no question," Schilling said. "We got outplayed
though. Certainly we didn't expect to leave here down 2-0.... We're
going to have to find a way to come out and get a game and get Randy
back on the mound and go from there."</TE>
<TE>   It was an expensive victory for St. Louis. The Cardinals lost
third baseman Scott Rolen for the rest of the series and possibly the
postseason after pinch runner Alex Cintron smashed into him while he
was trying to field a seventh-inning grounder.</TE>
<TE>   Rolen was diagnosed with a sprained left shoulder, the severity of
which an exam will determine today. Manager Tony La Russa won't ask
for sympathy from Arizona Manager Bob Brenly. The Diamondbacks are
without left fielder Luis Gonzalez, right fielder Danny Bautista and
infielder Craig Counsell, all of whom were heroes last October.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona led the National League in runs scored during the regular
season but managed only three in the first two games of this series.
Brenly has exacerbated his shortage of hitters by failing to get even
one at-bat in the first two games for Erubiel Durazo, who hit cleanup
in the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Many wonder if Brenly somehow is punishing the first baseman for
declining to move to the outfield when the Diamondbacks learned they
would be without both corner outfielders. Greg Colbrunn and Mark
Grace have gotten starts at first base with Quinton McCracken playing
right and David Dellucci and Mark Little sharing left.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona's only run Thursday was the result of Albert Pujols
booting the first ball hit to him after he moved from left field to
third to replace Rolen. The Diamondbacks put two on with two out
after tying the score 1-1 in the eighth inning but Grace, not Durazo,
got the call to pinch hit for Little.</TE>
<TE>   "We were saving Durazo for a later spot in the inning, if it got
to that," Brenly said. "Let's just put it that way."</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis, which had shocked Johnson with 10 hits in six innings
en route to a 12-2 victory on Tuesday, had seven hits in seven
innings against Schilling. The biggest was J.D. Drew's opposite-field
homer in the third inning.</TE>
<TE>   With Brenly failing to use closer Byung-Hyun Kim to protect a tie,
the Cardinals pushed across a ninth-inning run with a Whitey
Herzog-style rally.</TE>
<TE>   Edgar Renteria led off with a single off Koplove and Mike Matheny
bunted him to second. Cairo, pinch-hitting for reliever Jeff Fassero,
drove the first pitch he saw past Koplove and into center field.</TE>
<TE>   This marked the third time in 2 1/2 seasons that Arizona has lost
games when Johnson and Schilling started consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   They have done that 26 times this season; the Diamondbacks won
both games 14 times and at least one 11 others.</TE>
<TE>   "When you stop and think about it now, you faced those two guys,"
La Russa said. "I mean, nobody respects Randy and Curt more than the
St. Louis Cardinals. We competed against them. We ended up, when the
day was over, to have two wins.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, it adds something to it. [But] the wins are what you look
for."</TE>

<LD>Dave Kindred in the Sporting News, commenting on Pete Rose, the
huckster: "There is Rose, his shirttail flapping over an old man's
paunch, belly-flopping into third base during an old-timers' softball
game for which 41,092 Cincinnati zealots paid $30 a head [plus $5 for
a program, and Rose would only autograph that program].</LD>

<TE>   Trivia time: Name the matchup for the only World Series in the
1950s that did not involve a New York team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Full speed ahead: Ken Sugiura in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution:
"Allow Warren Sapp to explain the difference between the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers of the past and present.... 'It was a blue-collar team
that played the field-position game. Now, there's no such thing as a
field-position game with Jon Gruden,' Sapp said of his new coach. 'He
gets the ball, he thinks he can score from anywhere. You can put him
in Afghanistan, he thinks he can score a touchdown.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leading example: Mike Allen in the Washington Post, commenting on
President Bush: "This month, his annual physical showed the 6-foot,
189-pound president had a resting heart rate of 44 beats per minute,
putting him in the range of elite marathoners. He had 14.5% body fat.</TE>
<TE>   "In an interview in Runner's World, he said: 'I try to go for
longer runs, but it's tough around here at the White House on the
outdoor track. It's sad that I can't run longer. It's one of the
saddest things about the presidency.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Best and worst: Bubba Paris, former 49er offensive tackle, told
the Louisville Courier Journal about blocking for Joe Montana:</TE>
<TE>   "All you had to do was give him time to operate and he was going
to make things happen. He did it so often, that you wanted to make
sacrifices for him. I've had seven knee operations and four of them
were for him."</TE>
<TE>   Paris was less charitable about Jeff George, whom he protected in
his final NFL season as a member of the Indianapolis Colts: "He was
so narcissistic that most of the linemen wanted him to get hit, as
long as it wasn't their man doing it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Busting Broncos: Mark Kiszla of the Denver Post, ridiculing the
Broncos after their 34-23 loss to the Baltimore Ravens: "That the
Broncos got routed by a bad Baltimore bunch with zero resemblance to
the recent Super Bowl champs was shameful enough.... This was no way
to act on national television. Denver lost its composure and a large
measure of respect. The Broncos acted like punks."</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Dan Bickley in the Arizona Republic: "Curt Schilling
wins games, not friends. He evokes clubhouse whispers, anonymous
insults, a roll of the eyes whenever a camera is in his vicinity.</TE>
<TE>   "Red Light Curt, he's been called. And underneath his glittering
reputation as a dependable ace and big-game superstar lies a darker
perception: A me-first guy who speaks with a bullhorn, grates on his
teammates and is constantly seeking the media platform."</TE>

<KH>USC AT WASHINGTON STATE Saturday, 4 p.m., TBS</KH>
<HD>Bond of Brothers</HD>
<DH>Devard Darling starts anew at Washington State, playing in
memory of his absent twin</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PULLMAN, Wash.</DL>
<LD>They always shared a room.</LD>
<LD>   After all, Devard and Devaughn Darling had shared a womb, Devard
emerging first and Devaughn right behind, his hand on Devard's ankle.</LD>
<LD>   "I mean, sometimes I don't fully understand when I hear twins say,
'Oh, leave me alone' to the other twin, or 'Give me some space,' "
said Devard Darling, a sophomore receiver at Washington State. "That
was crazy to me and Devaughn. It was like I was looking at him,
seeing me. And that's the same way he felt about me. So it's like
part of me is laying on the ground right now."</LD>
<TE>   They were almost always together. And so Devard was nearby on the
day Devaughn died, collapsing on Feb. 26, 2001, after a strenuous
off-season workout at Florida State, where the identical twins were
freshmen football players.</TE>
<TE>   The Leon County medical examiner found no definitive cause of
death, but noted the presence of a sickle cell trait that affects one
in 12 African Americans and is linked by some studies to rare but
sudden exercise-related death.</TE>
<TE>   Devard, whose parents have filed a wrongful death suit against
Florida State claiming errors by coaches and trainers supervising the
workout, was alone for the first time in his life.</TE>
<TE>   Even his birthday became a day to endure, though his family made
sure to surround him.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember the first birthday," Devard said. "Our birthday is
April 16th, and you know, that's just a few months after he died. It
was the first time in my whole life I had my birthday alone."</TE>
<TE>   Watch Darling against USC on Saturday and see a player who says he
no longer feels completely alone.</TE>
<TE>   He is on the field again after transferring to Washington State
and receiving clearance to play following exhaustive medical tests.</TE>
<TE>   "It was something I'd been waiting for a long time," said Darling,
a 6-foot-3, 205-pound sophomore who has 28 receptions and seven
touchdowns in five games.</TE>
<TE>   "At the same time, it was very bittersweet for me. I missed having
Devaughn out there with me. It was a real emotional time for me
before and after the first game."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Gesser, Washington State's quarterback, watches closely.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time he gets in the end zone or makes a play, it's like he
wants to do something good, not only for himself," Gesser said.</TE>
<TE>   Devard says he plays for two.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though Devaughn is not with me, I feel it's something I need
to do. For both of us.</TE>
<TE>   "It just comforts me right now, knowing he's with me. I know he
would never leave me like that. We just always had that
communication, even if he was just going downstairs or going down the
hall or something, he would tell me. I know he would never leave."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Following Devaughn's death, Florida State refused to allow Devard
to play for the Seminoles again, offering to continue his scholarship
if he wanted to stay in school.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first heard some speculation like I couldn't play anymore,
when some doctors were trying to tell me I couldn't play, it was like
having two deaths," Darling said. "It was like taking away the two
things in my life I loved the most, playing football and Devaughn."</TE>
<TE>   Florida State, because of the pending lawsuit, would not comment
about the case except for general counsel Richard McFarlain's
assertion that the school does not believe it is liable for
Devaughn's death.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the doctors at Florida State, when something happened,
just put up their defenses right away," said the twins' mother, Wendy
Hunter. "They didn't even have the autopsy before they said he
couldn't play."</TE>
<TE>   As his brother did, Devard carries the sickle cell trait, a
generally benign condition that was detected during routine physicals
when the twins arrived at Florida State.</TE>
<TE>   The condition, in which only one sickle cell gene is present, is
not the same as sickle cell anemia, a more serious condition caused
by two inherited sickle cell genes. But during extreme exercise, some
studies say, the sickle cell trait appears to lower resistance to a
possible irregular heartbeat.</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA Sports Medicine Handbook addresses it, stating that
athletes who carry the trait should be closely monitored but "no
unwarranted restrictions or limitations should be placed on the
student-athlete with sickle cell trait."</TE>
<TE>   One twin was gone, but after a Houston cardiologist conducted a
stress test, an EKG and other tests and found no problems, the
Darling family supported Devard's desire to continue his career.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like [Devaughn] had some heart defect, just a sickle
cell trait, not something you can't live with or play sports with,"
Hunter said. "So I have no fear about Devard playing."</TE>
<TE>   Though Washington State wasn't his only offer, Florida State was
not the only team that didn't have a place for him.</TE>
<TE>   Among the schools Darling visited was USC, but NCAA rules
generally provide only for an exam by a team physician during
recruiting, and after no additional medical tests were conducted, the
courtship went nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   "The one that really got to me was Tennessee," said Darling, who
did not undergo tests at Tennessee. "I went up there for a visit, and
they helped me look for apartments and everything. The scholarship
was supposed to be there. When I got back from the trip, they called
me and Coach [Phillip] Fulmer tried to give me the excuse one of the
players they didn't think was going to make it academically made it
in. So they didn't have any scholarships left.... But you know, Coach
Fulmer and [Florida State Coach Bobby] Bowden are good friends and
they spoke, so whatever was said, I guess he didn't feel
comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   A Tennessee spokesman would not comment except to say Darling made
an official visit and did not enroll.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State decided to give Darling a chance, but only
following his enrollment and three months of medical tests was he
cleared.</TE>
<TE>   "It took some time, but it was thoroughly investigated by
everyone, our legal department of the university, team physicians, a
corps of team physicians and a corps of team trainers and our
attorney general's office," Washington State Coach Mike Price said.</TE>
<TE>   Darling grew frustrated as he waited.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like I felt every second I had a doctor on me, checking me
out or doing some kind of test," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser saw the struggle.</TE>
<TE>   "He was like, 'J, I just want to play, man. They just won't let me
play. Nothing's wrong with me,' " Gesser said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the cardiologists who examined Darling became one of his
biggest backers.</TE>
<TE>   "He was really adamant about allowing him to play," Price said.
"He just really felt like not allowing this kid to play would be a
crushing blow to the kid."</TE>
<TE>   Washington State trainer Bill Drake said he closely monitors
Darling, much as he does a group of other players.</TE>
<TE>   "People always ask that, are we nervous with him out here?" Drake
said. "Not any more than any of the rest of the guys. We have a
handful of players, 10 or 12 players who are on a special watch
group--asthma, diabetes, sickle cell, whatever it might be.</TE>
<TE>   "After the work-up that had been done, all the stress
echocardiograms, and especially with the cardiologist in Seattle
signing off on him, we felt real confident."</TE>
<TE>   Bowden, the Florida State coach, told the Orlando Sentinel in
September he is watching from afar, wishing Darling success.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure how many parents, if they lost a twin, would let the
other one play," Bowden said. "But I think it's going to be a legacy
of a brave man that had the mission once he lost his brother to
eulogize him any way he could."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On first sight, the rolling golden hills of the Palouse did
nothing for Darling.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first came out here, I was like, 'Where are they taking
me?' " he said. "It's nothing but wheat fields for miles and miles
and then boom, out of nowhere, Pullman."</TE>
<TE>   A cousin about the same age, Anovio Dixon, lived with him for a
semester last fall as Darling awaited a decision that he could begin
practicing during his redshirt year.</TE>
<TE>   Often, Darling thought about Florida State.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, in my heart that's where I want to be," he said. "You
know, my brother was buried in a Seminoles' uniform. I'm always going
to have strong feelings for them. That's just for the players. The
coaches and the administration, that's a whole other different story.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt that he was pushed over the limit. In those drills, we
were denied water. That's the most important factor right there. They
just pushed him over the limit, point blank."</TE>
<TE>   (An investigation by Florida State's university police found no
wrongdoing by coaches or trainers.)</TE>
<TE>   This year, Darling lives alone.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that way he can feel that Devaughn is still there," his
mother said.</TE>
<TE>   "When I watch him play on TV, it's just so overwhelming. It's such
a blessing for him to be out there and go on with his life after such
a loss."</TE>
<TE>   When Devard goes home to Texas, he finds a shrine by his mother's
door.</TE>
<TE>   "Devaughn's Florida State helmet, all the plaques from high
school," his mother said. "Every time Devard comes home, he puts on
Devaughn's helmet. It used to be hard to see him coming home and not
see them both.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just so glad he's able to go on."</TE>

<HD>Tennyson Makes Most of Moment</HD>

<LD>It took all of 31 seconds for McKinley Tennyson to make an impact on
the Galaxy.</LD>
<LD>   It took less time for the Galaxy to dub him with a new
nickname--the Minute Man--after the rookie forward scored the last
goal of the Galaxy's series-clinching 5-2 victory over Kansas City on
Wednesday night less than a minute after entering the game.</LD>
<LD>   "I think Gavin Glinton's very happy about that because he wanted
to give up that name," Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid said of another
forward who has a rapid-fire goal this year.</LD>
<TE>   It was in the third minute of second-half injury time when
Tennyson, who joined the Galaxy as a developmental player Aug. 12,
made his Major League Soccer debut by replacing Carlos Ruiz.</TE>
<TE>   After the Galaxy punted a ball away, Kansas City defender Carey
Talley attempted to pass it back to Wizard goalkeeper Tony Meola. An
onrushing Tennyson stole the ball, though, and was forced to his
right by Nick Garcia. But Tennyson's quick shot went through Garcia's
legs and to the left post, eluding Meola.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good to get a goal and do it in your first game," said
Tennyson, who played at UCLA and had 18 goals with the A-League's
Portland Timbers this season. "It's been long-awaited and there's
been a lot of hard work put in there, faith and trust in coaches. To
start out like that is great.</TE>
<TE>   "It establishes confidence and I'm here to help where I can. I've
scored goals before and I look at myself as a goal scorer and when I
get my chance I just want to keep working hard and do what I can to
help the Galaxy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Having picked up yellow cards in consecutive games, Ruiz is in
danger of having to sit out Wednesday's Game 2 against Colorado if he
gets another one in the series opener Saturday night at 7 in the Rose
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Schmid has already warned Ruiz, the Guatemalan striker who is
leading the MLS playoff scoring race with 10 points on four goals and
two assists.</TE>
<TE>   "His English is very, very good," Schmid said with a smile. "I was
going 'Uno, dos, tres,' and he goes, 'I know, three yellows.' Yeah,
three yellows, you don't want to get it, so he's aware."</TE>
<TE>   Said Ruiz: "Coach has already warned me about it but I don't
expect to get another yellow card. I won't change my style because I
have to stay aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's official: A potential Game 3 of the Galaxy's semifinal series
with Colorado will be played Oct. 12 at Cal State Fullerton's Titan
Stadium at 7 p.m. The Rose Bowl is booked that day with a UCLA-Oregon
football game.</TE>

<LD>Their players question it.</LD>
<LD>   Impatient fans reject it.</LD>
<LD>   And unrestricted free agents seeking a Kings' ransom to show off
their talents in Staples Center surely must hate it.</LD>
<TE>   But, contrary opinions aside, the Kings are determined to build a
Stanley Cup contender on their terms, by drafting and developing
young talent, thumbing their noses at high-priced free agents, making
prudent trades and always keeping an eye on the bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   Slow and steady wins the race? It could be the Kings' motto.</TE>
<TE>   As implemented by club President Tim Leiweke and General Manager
Dave Taylor, owner Philip Anschutz's "fiscally responsible"
philosophy has produced three consecutive 90-point seasons, a
franchise first, and three consecutive trips to the playoffs under
Coach Andy Murray, despite an ever-evolving roster.</TE>
<TE>   What it has failed to deliver, so far, is playoff success beyond a
first-round upset of the Detroit Red Wings two seasons ago.</TE>
<TE>   After last spring's opening-round elimination by the Colorado
Avalanche, the general feeling seemed to be that Murray, a master
motivator, had wrung just about all he could out of the overachieving
Kings. Murray's constant carping and the NHL's best record over the
season's last 4 1/2 months got them into the playoffs despite a poor
start.</TE>
<TE>   Basically a one-line team throughout the season's second half, the
Kings won with defense and special teams, posting a club-record 2.29
goals-against average while ranking first in the league on the power
play and third in penalty killing.</TE>
<TE>   But even after their lack of offensive depth was exposed by
series-ending injuries to Adam Deadmarsh and defenseman Philippe
Boucher and a 4-0 Game 7 loss to the Avalanche in which scoring
leader Jason Allison gamely played despite a painful charley horse,
the Kings mostly stood idle during the summer.</TE>
<TE>   While each of their division rivals added or retained key
veterans, the Kings were outbid for their most prominent unrestricted
free agents, Boucher and long-in-the-tooth winger Kelly Buchberger,
and ignored all others with high price tags.</TE>
<TE>   Still searching for a top-six forward nearly a year after the
trade that brought Allison and sent Jozef Stumpel and Glen Murray to
the Boston Bruins, the Kings made no attempt to lure Bill Guerin (41
goals with the Bruins last season), Teemu Selanne (29 with the San
Jose Sharks), Tony Amonte (27 with the Chicago Blackhawks) or Bobby
Holik (25 with the New Jersey Devils).</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they trumpeted the signings of four
greenhorns--20-year-old prospects Michael Cammalleri, Alexander
Frolov, Jared Aulin and Yanick Lehoux--and made a few minor trades.
One jettisoned late-season acquisition Cliff Ronning, a scoring
leader with the Nashville Predators but a bust with the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there was anyone out there that at the end of the
day we felt would have made a huge impact on this team," Leiweke
said, ignoring that only two Kings, Deadmarsh and Ziggy Palffy,
scored more than 19 goals last season. "I think we're pretty happy
with what we've got."</TE>
<TE>   And besides, Leiweke reiterated for the umpteenth time, "I just
don't believe in spending tons of money on free agents. They lose
their incentive."</TE>
<TE>   His opinion, of course, is not shared by all, least of all the
Dallas Stars, Phoenix Coyotes and New York Rangers, who signed
Guerin, Amonte and Holik. Nor by the Pacific Division champion
Sharks, who re-signed Selanne.</TE>
<TE>   King defenseman Mathieu Schneider, echoing his teammates'
concerns, wondered why management wasn't willing to take the extra
step to put the Kings over the top, suggesting that the team as
constructed was only a key player or two away from joining the NHL's
elite.</TE>
<TE>   Allison suggested that by not improving, the Kings got worse.</TE>
<TE>   "Our conference is even stronger this season than it was last
season, and look at how close the race was at the end of last
season," he said. "You can't count on any young guy to come in and
make your team better. You hope they do, but you can't count on it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not fair to them, either, to sit there and say, 'You're
going to make the difference on our team this year,' because none of
these guys has played an 82-game schedule ... and none has played at
anywhere near this level....</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to be realistic."</TE>
<TE>   In that regard, at least, management seems to agree. Of the four
much-hyped rookies signed over the summer, only Frolov remains on the
roster.</TE>
<TE>   Another reality for the Kings is that their summer slumber cost
them fans. Kurt Schwartzkopf, vice president of sales and marketing
for the team, said that of the 300 season-ticket holders who canceled
their orders after last season, about 50 cited team performance (or,
in this case, inactivity) as the primary reason.</TE>
<TE>   In July, the Kings invited them to their prospects camp in El
Segundo. Not all showed up, but the 30 or so who did were treated to
free food and beer and invited to grill Leiweke, Taylor and Murray
about the team's plans.</TE>
<TE>   According to Schwartzkopf, about half renewed their season seats,
contributing to about an 85% renewal rate, which Schwartzkopf said is
a little below average and about 10% less than last year, when the
Kings rode the momentum of the first-round upset of the Red Wings the
previous spring.</TE>
<TE>   "Our fans are really loyal," he said. "They're super die-hards,
especially the core season-ticket-holder base. They love watching
kids grow in the system."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings are banking on it because they're determined to erase
the sins of the past, when prospects were mostly regarded as trade
fodder, if they panned out at all, and the club usually chased
short-term solutions.</TE>
<TE>   None of their elite players were drafted by the Kings, but the
club would like that to change in the future while it continues
pursuing trades such as the deals that brought Allison, Deadmarsh,
Palffy, Schneider, Bryan Smolinski, Mattias Norstrom, Aaron Miller
and Felix Potvin.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, everybody wants to win, and that's what we want too,"
Taylor said. "And we think that this process and this approach will
make us a competitive team over the long haul, and that's ultimately
what we want....</TE>
<TE>   "We're closing the gap on the top teams, in my opinion, but we
don't want to trade away a lot of our youth or all of our draft
choices just to take one quick stab at it. The general approach is a
long-term approach, continuing to show patience."</TE>
<TE>   They only hope that their fans will come along for the ride.</TE>

<HD>They Take Fun Out of Hating Yankees</HD>

<LD>The New York Yankees have come to Anaheim. In baseball's postseason.
Not for a vacation but for playoff games. And they embrace the Rally
Monkey.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a fun atmosphere," Derek Jeter said of playing at Edison
Field. "There's been a lot of Yankee fans when we've played here but
I wouldn't anticipate that the next couple of days. They got that
monkey, though. Looking forward to it."</LD>
<LD>   What makes the Yankees the Yankees, besides George Steinbrenner
and a $140-million payroll, is their non-cocky confidence, their
blase sense of entitlement, their professional urgency instead of
frantic, pressured nervousness.</LD>
<TE>   These are the biggest sporting moments Orange County has hosted,
two American League division series playoff games against the
greatest sports dynasty in American history. Don't even think the
Angels have grabbed any kind of momentum because they won Game 2 in a
dramatic way.</TE>
<TE>   "We were down 0-2 to Oakland last year," Jeter said. "We lost the
first two games at home."</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees won that series, 3-2, sweeping the A's at Oakland. In
Game 3, Jorge Posada hit a home run, Mike Mussina (who will start
tonight against the Angels) threw seven scoreless innings, Jeter and
Posada teamed for a great pickup, flip and tag at the plate of Jeremy
Giambi and the Yankees won, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees won Game 4, 9-2. Bernie Williams drove in five runs.
Back at Yankee Stadium in the foregone conclusion that was Game 5,
Jeter passed Pete Rose for the major league record in postseason hits
and the Yankees won, 5-3, and became the first team in history to win
a five-game series after losing the first two games at home.</TE>
<TE>   But Jeter also pointed out that just because the Yankees came back
to beat Oakland last year does not mean the Angels haven't earned
some advantage by splitting in New York this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Oakland was a different team than Anaheim," Jeter said. "Anaheim
is tough. A lot of people are picking us to breeze through this
round, but the Angels are a tough team. They don't strike out. They
put the ball in play, move runners over, they have quality pitching,
they don't beat themselves."</TE>
<TE>   What's impressive about the Angels is the way they, and their
manager, have been unaffected by the enormity of playoff baseball,
New York-style. Manager Mike Scioscia easily accepted all the
criticism about his use of his bullpen after Game 1 and followed his
own mind in Game 2. Scioscia's belief in himself installs itself in
the heads of his players.</TE>
<TE>   What's impressive about the Yankees is the way they gracefully
assume they will be champions, how smoothly they avoid making
mountains out of molehills and how well they understand what has
brought the Angels here.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to forget about what happened the previous night," Jeter
said. He meant this about losing Game 2 and about his being called
out on strikes in the bottom of the eighth inning with two out and
the bases loaded. Strike three, Jeter is convinced, was outside. "But
that's over," Jeter says. "No sense thinking about it anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Alfonso Soriano wouldn't get angry about the Troy Percival pitch
that smacked him square on the back, either.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not on purpose, no, I don't think," Soriano said. "It's
just baseball. It just happens. What should you do but just move on?"</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees are secure enough about themselves that they can
acknowledge the Angels as something more than a gutsy little team,
which is the TV story line.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1998 the Angels have gone 24-21 against the Yankees. "We
notice that," New York relief pitcher Mike Stanton said. "We know we
are playing a team we don't intimidate."</TE>
<TE>   Yankee Manager Joe Torre was once an Angel broadcaster, in the
mid-1980s. He remembers the Angels' heartbreaking Game 5 loss to
Boston in the 1986 American League championship series, when they
were within an out of their first trip to the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "I got to know the Cowboy [owner Gene Autry] and a lot of people
around here and really became close to them," Torre said. "I felt so
badly in 1986. I was in Chicago at the time of that Game 5 loss and I
just felt very badly for the Cowboy and for Gene Mauch. I could still
see it now, Reggie [Jackson] standing next to Mauch in the dugout,
waiting for the last out to be recorded. It wasn't to be.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a club I always rooted for, obviously not when I play
them, but otherwise because I have a connection here."</TE>
<TE>   So Torre understands the Angels and their haunted past. He
sympathizes and might even feel a little sad if the Yankees break
Angel hearts. But only a little.</TE>
<TE>   As the Yankees took batting and fielding practice Thursday, balls
were flying off the bats. Laughter ricocheted off the walls. This is
so far from pressure for the Yankees. This is fun. They appreciate
the opponent, but they expect to win.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to resent the Yankee name, the monstrous payroll, the
imperious Steinbrenner. It's hard to dislike Torre, Jeter, Soriano,
Williams, Jason Giambi, coach Don Zimmer and all the others who are
happy to be Yankees because it's a privilege and not a right, an
honor and not a burden.</TE>

<KH>Q&amp;A WITH JACQUES ROGGE</KH>
<HD>Game for a Challenge in a Changing World</HD>

<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jacques Rogge, an orthopedic surgeon from Belgium, was elected
president of the International Olympic Committee in July 2001,
succeeding Juan Antonio Samaranch of Spain. Two months later, the
terrorist attacks on the United States put increased security
pressures on the February 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games. The Games
were an organizational and financial success but were marked by
judging controversies in figure skating and other sports. On July 31,
purported Russian mobster Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov was arrested in
Italy on U.S. charges alleging a conspiracy to fix the Salt Lake
pairs and ice dancing results.</LD>
<LD>   As the legal process grinds along, the IOC focus now also includes
the 2004 Summer Games in Athens; a recommendation to drop baseball,
softball and modern pentathlon from the Olympic program as of 2008;
and the developing races among cities worldwide wanting to stage the
2010 Winter Games or 2012 Summer Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Rogge spoke from his office at IOC headquarters in Lausanne,
Switzerland.</LD>
<TE>   Question: What is the IOC's No. 1 priority?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: The IOC's No. 1 priority, sport's No. 1 priority, is the
credibility of sports against threats by doping, threats by
corruption and threats by violence both on and off the pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Q:  How seriously ought those who care about the Olympic movement
be worried about the U.S. criminal case alleging a fix in the skating
competition at the Salt Lake Games?</TE>
<TE>   A: This is something we take very seriously. Unfortunately, we
still are not in possession of the full file. The [U.S.] Justice
Department has withheld its information.... As long as we don't have
the full record of the tapes of Mr. Tokhtakhounov and of the events,
we have to wait for a trial.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How does the organizational success of the Salt Lake Games bear
on U.S. chances for the 2012 Olympics, and how--at this moment--do
you rate those chances?</TE>
<TE>   A: I don't think that Salt Lake would have changed the perception
we have of the United States, which is one of a very sophisticated,
well-organized country. We know that you can organize good Games. The
Atlanta situation [site of the 1996 Summer Games] has not altered our
perception; Atlanta was an exception and normally you would organize
very good Games. Salt Lake just confirmed that.</TE>
<TE>   What are your chances? If I'm well informed, it's boiling down now
to New York and San Francisco. Both cities have what it takes to
organize perfect Games. They're both good cities in a politically
stable, very sophisticated country, which used to have a good
economy. But the problem of the economy is the whole world's.... The
competition will not be easy because Germany will have the same
conditions; Spain will have the same conditions; probably Paris will
be bidding. I could go on with big cities like Moscow; they could
provide very good Games. It's going to be an interesting fight.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What is the impact of 9/11 on New York's bid? A year ago, when
the mayor of Rome suggested that all other cities bow out should New
York become the U.S. candidate, you had said the gesture was
premature. Now?</TE>
<TE>   A: If New York is going to win the Games, it should win on the
merits, in an open and fair competition. We should not give to New
York a consolation prize. We should give to New York the prize of
being the best city of all cities in world. That's something New York
should be more proud of than if everybody withdraws for--I would
say--legitimate emotional reasons. I think everybody wants to pay
tribute to the victims and the heroes of Ground Zero....</TE>
<TE>   But if New York wants the Games, it has to deserve it.... I'm
quite sure New Yorkers would not want it to be different.</TE>
<TE>   Q: An IOC committee has recommended baseball, softball and modern
pentathlon be dropped from the Olympic program. Were you surprised by
the reaction and what are your expectations for the IOC session in
Mexico City in November, where that proposal is on the agenda?</TE>
<TE>   A: I'm absolutely not surprised by the reaction; no one who is on
that list would be happy. I put it in a little bit of perspective.
The IOC has only added events and sports and disciplines since 1948.
The last time we deleted sports was in 1936 in Berlin, with polo. Now
we've added sports. We were 17 sports [in 1948] in London, 28 today;
we were 140 events, compared to 300 today; there were something
around 5,000 athletes compared to 10,500. Now most of these
additions--I will even say 99%--are perfectly legitimate because new
sports came up, because sports became more popular, because women's
sports emerged, because television came and there was more money....</TE>
<TE>   We would like to finalize everything by [the IOC session in]
Prague next year. Will that lead to revolution? I don't think so.
Will that lead to changes? I think so. This is the first time since
1948--54 years--that the IOC will have examined critically its own
program, and I think it's time to do that.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What is your confidence level as regards preparations for
Athens, and how will those Games be different from the 2000 Sydney
Olympics?</TE>
<TE>   A: Of course, it's going to be activities until the last day, but
definitely we are pleased by the speed of the preparations today.</TE>
<TE>   How will they be different? Definitely, I say, the ambience will
be different. This is something unique, the country that invented the
Games, and they are extremely proud of that, it's part of their
culture and identity, and we will bathe in this atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Definitely, the Games will not have the same technical, let's say,
slickness of Sydney in certain aspects. I don't speak about sport;
that will be OK. Transport will definitely be more difficult because
of the configuration of the city. Accommodation will be more
difficult than Sydney with its huge accommodation capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You were recently made a count by the king of your country. Are
you concerned that this might prompt some of the same sort of
criticism that shadowed your predecessor when he was made a Spanish
marquis?</TE>
<TE>   A: "Why would it? ... It's a tradition. We are a kingdom and the
king can grant nobility to people. It's a tradition in our country
and accepted by our country and belongs to our traditions. I have no
issues on that."</TE>

<HD>Chelsea, Rangers Ousted From UEFA Cup Field</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most of the leading clubs competing in the UEFA Cup survived
completion of the first round Thursday, but two big-name teams,
Chelsea of England and Rangers of Scotland, crashed out in
spectacular fashion.</LD>
<LD>   Chelsea fell at the first hurdle for the third season in a row
when it was beaten, 4-2, by unheralded Viking Stavanger of Norway,
thereby losing the two-game series, 5-4, on aggregate.</LD>
<LD>   Erik Neyland scored twice for the Norwegian team at home,
including the decisive goal in the 87th minute.</LD>
<TE>   "We played brilliantly," Neyland told Reuters. "We are so happy.
It's always difficult to play away in the UEFA Cup against any team,
and we proved that today."</TE>
<TE>   Rangers, the Scottish Premier League leader, defeated Viktoria
Zizkov of the Czech Republic, 3-1 in overtime, in Glasgow, but the
visiting team had won the first game, 2-0, in Prague and its lone
goal Thursday--by Marcel Licka in the 100th minute--was enough to see
it advance on the away goals rule.</TE>
<TE>   Rangers Coach Alex McLeish said the 2-0 loss at Prague had been
the telling blow. In 46 years of European competition, Rangers have
never overcome a two-goal deficit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Llamosa Suspended</TE>
<TE>   New England Revolution and U.S. World Cup defender Carlos Llamosa
was suspended from Saturday's Major League Soccer playoff semifinal
opener against the Columbus Crew and fined $1,000 by the league for
arguing with game officials in an earlier playoff game against the
Chicago Fire.</TE>
<TE>   Llamosa had already been fined $500 and had served a one-game
suspension before MLS on Thursday increased the penalty for what it
called "prolonged and aggressive dissent."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Referee Ban Upheld</TE>
<TE>   Byron Moreno, the Ecuadorean referee who was suspended for 20
games by the country's soccer federation for mishandling a league
game, has had his appeal against the ban rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Moreno, whose controversial decisions during the South Korea-Italy
match at the World Cup first brought him to international attention,
unaccountably added 12 minutes of injury time to a game between Liga
de Quito and visiting Barcelona, thereby giving the home team time to
score twice and grab a 4-3 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Barcelona complained, pointing out that Moreno was a candidate for
a place on the Quito City Council and that he had allowed politics to
interfere with his judgment.</TE>
<TE>   The federation rejected Moreno's claim that stoppages and
time-wasting had been behind his decision to prolong the game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brazil on the Road</TE>
<TE>   World champion Brazil will travel to South Korea for a Nov. 20
game against the 2002 World Cup co-host, the Brazilian soccer
federation announced in Rio de Janeiro.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil holds a 2-1 all-time edge in games between the two
countries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Asian Games</TE>
<TE>   China, South Korea and Thailand advanced to the quarterfinals of
the Asian Games on Thursday with victories in Busan, South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Park Hang-Seo's South Korea team shut out Malaysia, 4-0, to
the delight of the "Red Devil" fans at the Masan Sports Complex. Two
goals by Kim Eun-Jung and one apiece from Choi Tak-Uk and Lee
Dong-Gook were enough to leave the Koreans unbeaten after three
games.</TE>
<TE>   China had a more difficult time but defeated India, 2-0, in a game
between the world's two most populous nations.</TE>
<TE>   Thailand also reached the final eight by beating the United Arab
Emirates, 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   The other five quarterfinalists will be decided in games to be
played Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bolivian Players Strike</TE>
<TE>   The financially troubled Bolivian league suffered another blow
Thursday when the players from Wilstermann went on strike and refused
to travel to a game against Bolivar in La Paz, saying they had not
been paid their June wages.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, defender Jorge Zapata went on a brief hunger strike
outside the headquarters of his former club, Oriente Petrolero,
claiming the club owed him $3,000.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to survive, the Bolivian league earlier this year
imposed a maximum wage of $1,500 a month for players and cut expenses
by not allowing referees to travel to games outside their home towns.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Israel Game Postponed</TE>
<TE>   Israel's Euro 2004 qualifying game against Cyprus scheduled for
Oct. 16 was postponed until April 30 after UEFA, European soccer's
governing body, ruled that the security situation in the Middle East
warranted such a move.</TE>

<LD>An attempt is made in this space each week to make things as clear as
possible. Nothing is worse than confusing the reader.</LD>
<LD>   A real challenge is trying to explain the television schedule for
the first round of the baseball playoffs. Some games are on Fox. Some
are on ABC Family. There will be one game on FX on Saturday. And
there may be a game on ESPN2 on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   We'll try to clear things up, beginning with Game 3 of the Angels'
series against the New York Yankees tonight at 5. You can watch it on
Channel 11 or ABC Family.</LD>
<TE>   But if you tune into Channel 11, a Fox station, you'll notice the
announcers are not Joe Buck and Tim McCarver, who called the first
two games in the series.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the announcers will be Jon Miller and Joe Morgan, who
work for ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   So what are they doing on Fox?</TE>
<TE>   Here's where it gets a little tricky.</TE>
<TE>   In case you missed it, ABC Family is carrying the postseason
baseball telecasts that were on Fox Family last season. Fox Family
was sold to Disney and became ABC Family. Included in the sale were
the rights to as many as 12 first-round games.</TE>
<TE>   Disney chose to leave the first-round playoff games on ABC Family
as a way of promoting the channel and attracting new viewers.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN, another Disney entity, is producing the telecasts for ABC
Family. ESPN also is providing the announcers because ABC Family
doesn't have any.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's Angel-Yankee game is being televised to the nation by
ABC Family. But baseball requires that games on ABC Family, a cable
channel, also be made available to over-the-air stations in the
participating teams' markets.</TE>
<TE>   Because Fox holds the rights to the majority of the postseason,
Fox stations have first dibs, at least this year.</TE>
<TE>   So that's why today's Angel game, with ESPN announcers, ended up
on Fox-owned Channel 11 as well as ABC Family.</TE>
<TE>   As for the weekend, Fox and ABC Family are allowed to farm out
games if there is an overlap. There will be two 1 p.m. games
Saturday, so one will be on Fox and the other on FX. If there are two
1 p.m. games Sunday, one will be on ABC Family and one on ESPN2.</TE>
<TE>   Still confused? Well, we tried.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Growing Pains</TE>
<TE>   ABC Family's first venture into sports has come with some growing
pains--literally. If you happened to still be watching Tuesday
night's St. Louis-Arizona game at 11 p.m., when the Cardinals led,
12-2, with two out in the bottom of the ninth, an old episode of
"Growing Pains" suddenly showed up on the screen.</TE>
<TE>   Someone flicked the wrong switch, but the problem was almost
immediately rectified. And probably not too many people noticed,
considering the lopsided score and the time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Change in Plans</TE>
<TE>   Buck was hoping to announce two games in two sports in San
Francisco on Sunday--the 49ers and St. Louis Rams followed by the
Giants and Atlanta Braves. But because baseball scheduled Game 4 of
the Giant-Brave series for 1 p.m., Buck will work only the football
game. He'll also take Saturday off to prepare for the Rams and 49ers.
His replacement on baseball both days will be Thom Brennaman.</TE>
<TE>   But after Sunday, Buck will be off football for two weeks to work
baseball full time through the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ratings Update</TE>
<TE>   Although Los Angeles had a higher rating than New York for Game 1
of the Angel-Yankee series, New York edged L.A. for Game 2, 15.0 to
14.8.</TE>
<TE>   After the first two prime-time playoff telecasts, Fox is averaging
a 6.7 rating and a 12 share. After the first two prime-time telecasts
last year, both Oakland-Yankees, Fox was averaging a 5.8/10. That's a
16% increase.</TE>
<TE>   Also, ratings for the games on ABC Family through Wednesday were
up slightly from those on Fox Family for the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   College Football</TE>
<TE>   USC, which plays at Washington State on Saturday at 4 p.m., makes
its second appearance on TBS. The Trojans' game at Kansas State also
was on TBS.</TE>
<TE>   The same announcers who worked that game, Ron Thulin and Charles
Davis, will work Saturday's game. Davis, a former Tennessee defensive
back, is a relative newcomer to broadcasting. But he was excellent on
USC-Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's game at Oregon State Saturday at 12:30 p.m. will be on
Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Channel 4 has an interesting matchup at 11:30 a.m.,
with Tyrone Willingham's Notre Dame team playing host to his former
team, Stanford. Tom Hammond and Pat Haden report from South Bend,
Ind.</TE>

Sunday, when NBC televises the EA Sports 500 from Talladega, Ala.
Also, Digital cable subscribers will be able to purchase the package,
which will have six races left after Sunday, for $35.</TE>

<HD>A Pair of Mass Destruction Wild Cards</HD>
<DH>How Hussein and Sharon react to Iraq war will determine the
devastation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY ARONSON</AU>
<BD>Geoffrey Aronson is director of the Foundation for
Middle East Peace.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Sept. 5, the first shot in the second Gulf War was fired. That
day, a posse of U.S. and British aircraft attacked a
command-and-control facility of the Iraqi air defense network at
H-3--an Iraqi airbase 240 miles west of Baghdad.</LD>
<LD>   During the first Gulf War, Iraq launched 39 conventionally armed
surface-to-surface missiles against Israel from H-3. Israel, under
the leadership of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, bowed to U.S.
entreaties not to return fire and left the unsuccessful hunt for
Iraq's mobile launchers to British and U.S. commandos.</LD>
<LD>   As the Bush administration commences a second round of
hostilities, a central concern is, once again, the possibility that
Iraq will use nonconventional weapons to attack Israel, which would
then feel compelled to enter the battle against Baghdad with its own
sophisticated array of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear
weapons.</LD>
<TE>   Undermining Washington's strategy is the least of the calamities
that the use of such weapons would unleash. To maintain its control
over the war to come, the Bush administration will try to prevent
Iraq's use of its vast western expanses for missile launches against
Israel, and it will lean on the Sharon government to keep its bombs
"in the basement."</TE>
<TE>   Though the conduct of war can be unpredictable, there is less
chance today than in 1991 that either Iraq or Israel will cross the
nonconventional "red line."</TE>
<TE>   The use of such extraordinary weapons is a function not only of
intentions but also of capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   It is widely acknowledged that Iraq's capabilities are far reduced
from what they were in the first Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   The inspection regime imposed after the war destroyed more
missiles, stocks of chemical weapons and nuclear material than the
war itself. The postwar sanctions imposed on Iraqi trade and the
inability to train and test have clearly reduced Iraq's
nonconventional capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, U.S. and Israeli efforts since the war have
focused on improving the intelligence and technical capabilities
necessary to preempt, detect, intercept and destroy Iraq's reduced
arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   Both countries today know far more about the critical region
surrounding H-3 and are far better equipped to neutralize attacks of
the conventional or nonconventional variety than they were a decade
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Yet when intentions are assessed, any complacency about the
prospects of the coming war not spinning out of control disappears.
Chemical warheads were found at H-3 after the first Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   The extensive infrastructure for the production and deployment of
chemical and biological weapons uncovered suggested that Iraq's
decision not to use such weapons was a function not of incapability
but rather of intention.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq was deterred from crossing the nonconventional threshold
because both U.S. and Israeli leaders made it clear that Iraq's use
of such weapons would be met with a response aimed at decapitating
the regime.</TE>
<TE>   Saddam Hussein, whose instincts for self-preservation are notable,
behaved rationally. He refused to cross the red line and thus
preserved his autocracy despite his battlefield defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's response was, and is, more nuanced. Israel was persuaded
to stay out of the war in 1991 because it was not attacked with
chemical weapons and because the missiles that did strike spread more
panic than destruction and death.</TE>
<TE>   Shamir was convinced that coalition forces would be more effective
in destroying Iraqi capabilities in the H-3 region and that restraint
would be rewarded with an enhanced relationship and coordination of
postwar diplomacy with Washington. These calculations remain relevant
today.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike a decade ago, Washington's war aims are now focused on
the ouster of Hussein and his regime. The Bush administration in 2002
is not offering the Iraqi leader any incentive to forgo use of his
reduced nonconventional capabilities against Israel or U.S. forces.
Washington hopes that even if Hussein himself won't be deterred from
using nonconventional weapons, his followers, facing the prospect of
a war crimes trial in The Hague, will.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even in the face of a U.S. policy aiming at his ouster, the
forces deterring Hussein's use of chemical weapons remain
considerable. First is his all-encompassing instinct for
self-preservation, the chances for which will be enhanced if he
continues to observe the weapons of mass destruction taboo. Using
such weapons would give lie to Iraqi protestations denying their
existence. And just as Hussein refrained in 1991 from targeting
Jerusalem because of his fear of harming Islam's holy shrines, he may
not want his parting legacy to focus on the multitudes of Arabs
killed by his chemical weapons in the Holy Land.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's expectations for a manageable conflict depend in large part
on constraining the actions of two leaders--Hussein and Ariel
Sharon--who are not noted for their fealty to American preferences.
Any number of circumstances could cause Iraq or Israel to attempt a
devastating attack against the other, laying waste to Bush's plans
for a quick and unambiguous victory.</TE>

<HD>Dockworkers Shore Up Their Case</HD>
<DH>Union was willing to work while negotiating in good faith.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL CONTRERAS</AU>
<BD>Miguel Contreras is executive secretary-treasurer of
the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Pacific Maritime Assn., which negotiates for shippers and port
terminal operators, has manufactured a phony crisis to give it
increased leverage at the bargaining table against the dockworkers'
union. A look at the facts is necessary to understand this cynical
scheme.</LD>
<LD>   A lockout by management--allegedly in response to worker
slowdowns--began last week. Dockworkers were laboring full bore to
unload hundreds of millions of dollars of imported goods bound for
retail store shelves for the holiday season.</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street frets that a prolonged lockout will maim an already
frail economy. Retailers, growers and manufacturers are pressing
President Bush for relief. The anti-union Republican president says
he is "worried" and "closely monitoring" events.</LD>
<TE>   How did we get here?</TE>
<TE>   The big stumbling block to a renegotiated labor agreement is
technology. Shipping and terminal companies want to replace hundreds
of unionized clerks with labor-saving devices, such as bar codes and
scanners.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1960s, when mechanization first became an issue, the
International Longshore and Warehouse Union has not stood in the way
of progress, even as it lost tens of thousands of unionized jobs to
technological advances. Labor's only insistence has been that the
high-tech workers who remain be protected by union contracts. At
stake are good jobs that workers need to preserve a middle-class
standard of living.</TE>
<TE>   The maritime association wants the jobs to be nonunion.</TE>
<TE>   One of the problems is that many of the docks are owned by large
foreign corporations. Many of these firms are not accustomed to the
labor rights and on-the-job protections that American union members
have fought--and sometimes died--to win and preserve.</TE>
<TE>   This is a legitimate point of disagreement that can and should be
ironed out during negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, workers want to continue to work while their union
continues to talk. Union negotiators have showed up to negotiate. On
Wednesday, they even consented to participate in federal mediation,
which the union has traditionally opposed.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than bargain in good faith, the maritime association has
fabricated a crisis to sabotage bargaining that could lead to a
resolution of the outstanding issues.</TE>
<TE>   Dockworkers normally labor in eight-hour shifts. They can choose
to work longer hours for overtime pay. Most overtime is earned during
flex or night shifts. Last week, the employers cut those premium-pay
night shifts, hoping to foment discord and spark worker walkouts or
slowdowns to justify a lockout.</TE>
<TE>   There have been no strikes or slowdowns. In response to the
elimination of lucrative night shifts, dockworkers pledged to forgo
all overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Workers were doing everything they were supposed to do. They
showed up for work. They worked their entire regular shifts. They
meticulously followed the provisions of their union contract. They
were not breaking any company rules. Yet last week, the companies for
which the maritime association negotiates locked out all the
dockworkers and shut down ports up and down the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, maritime association executives showed up with armed
bodyguards at a session with the head of the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service. It was a slap in the face to union leaders, who
angrily walked out of the meeting. Mediation service director Peter
Hurtgen called the use of bodyguards "inappropriate and a breach of
bargaining protocol."</TE>
<TE>   Economists project billions of dollars in losses to the economy if
the lockout persists. Truckers and workers in a host of related
industries are facing genuine hardship. Retailers are frantic as
holiday merchandise sits stranded offshore on ships.</TE>
<TE>   All of this could be avoided if the maritime association
negotiated an equitable contract with the dockworkers' union instead
of putting the nation's economy at risk to boost its clout at the
bargaining table.</TE>

<HD>Innocence Left the Game When Violence Took the Field</HD>
<DH>A quarter-century ago, a World Series incident changed
sports forever.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALD ESKENAZI</AU>
<BD>Gerald Eskenazi covered sports for the New York Times
for 41 years and is the author of 13 books, most recently "Gang
Green" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1998).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the Angels perform in their first post-season since the Reagan
years, they face the Yankees today on a green playing field that
evokes idyllic memories of trolley cars and day baseball, when men in
straw boaters filled the seats.</LD>
<LD>   But post-season baseball also brings us back to the moment when
sports changed forever.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, everyone has his own epiphany in this momentous matter.
For me, it was 25 years ago--Oct. 18, 1977--when many of us witnessed
the loss of innocence of the last innocent sport.</LD>
<TE>   It was at a besieged Yankee Stadium as Reggie Jackson hit three
home runs to trigger the Yankees' World Series victory over the
Dodgers--and an apocalyptic scene not repeated in baseball since. It
mirrored who we were--at least on our playing fields--and set the
tone for the sports years that followed.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, the 1960s had seen college kids and war protesters rioting.
But for the most part, the ferment of the young had not gripped major
league sports, had not affected police in stadiums, had not turned to
rioting and looting on grassy, green ball fields.</TE>
<TE>   At a dinner before a National Hockey League all-star game, the
redoubtable Gordie Howe, then in his 40s, noted how the 1960s had
changed the look and demeanor of the young, saying prayerfully,
"Thank God we don't have any of those long-haired guys in hockey."</TE>
<TE>   A championship victory did not automatically call for drunken
louts overturning cars downtown, or herald attacks on women, or bring
out arsonists setting fires in the stands.</TE>
<TE>   That, of course, is now the norm when a team captures a baseball,
basketball, football or hockey championship.</TE>
<TE>   Life in American sports changed that night in a meeting of East
and West Coast teams.</TE>
<TE>   True, some could argue that the American pastime had exhibited
uncharacteristic cynicism when the Dodgers and Giants left Brooklyn
and Manhattan, respectively, for the Golden West about 20 years
earlier. Perhaps.</TE>
<TE>   But Walter O'Malley and Horace Stoneham didn't whack anyone over
the head when they did it. Just in the heart.</TE>
<TE>   Then Jackson hit his three homers, the Yankees won their first
World Series since 1962, and the police sent five mounted patrol
officers onto the field.</TE>
<TE>   In that eerie twilight that is baseball under the lights, fans
started to rip out seats. Hundreds of fans dashed onto the field,
clawing up chunks of grass. Graig Nettles, the Yankees' third
baseman, had to punch a fan out of the way as he left the field.
Jackson wore his batting helmet onto the field to protect him on his
run to the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   But the horses, big dark bays, trampling the baseball field; a
perimeter of police along the foul lines; the stentorian-voiced
public address announcer Bob Sheppard calling for calm--such a
cinematic moment, Francis Ford Coppola would have loved it.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere in that heart of darkness, Marlon Brando--or at least
Casey Stengel--must have been lurking.</TE>
<TE>   Skip ahead, past the Bronx and the 1970s, to police blotters and
behavior that is raucous, often felonious. Behavior that ranges from
the gambling of Pete Rose, who perhaps loved baseball more than
anyone else, to the sinister--more than 100 documented cases of
athlete rape every year.</TE>
<TE>   Did you choke your coach? No problem if you say you were "dissed."
Another team will pick you up.</TE>
<TE>   Beat your wife? Take an anger-management course. Shoot your limo
driver in your house? Tell your friends to say the guy did it to
himself. Want to get on television? Phone your sister from the
stands, take your teenage son along, jump onto the field and beat up
a coach.</TE>
<TE>   And still we wonder why we read so many stories now about athletes
abusing others. Or of that father-son fan combination. Or even of a
George Steinbrenner hiring a punk to spy on his star, Dave Winfield.
Not much of a jump from there to see owners colluding against the
players.</TE>
<TE>   This sea change began in, of all places, a baseball field a
quarter of a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   A few months after the incident, I picked up the paper one
morning, and read a story about a high-ranking police officer who was
arrested for taking shakedown money. He was one of those who had
complained to me about "kids today."</TE>

<HD>HMOs' Shell Game to Avoid Paying Doctors Hurts the Patients</HD>
<DH>Health care suffers as practitioners scramble to stay
afloat financially.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM GROSSMAN</AU>
<BD>William Grossman is chief of cardiology at UCSF Medical
Center in San Francisco.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a patient arrives complaining of severe chest pains or a mother
brings in her child coughing up blood, doctors can't wait for
clarification on whether this test or that procedure is covered by
the managed-care industry.</LD>
<LD>   But in trying to do our job--providing the right care in a timely
fashion--doctors and hospitals are getting ripped off so badly by
health maintenance organizations that we find ourselves increasingly
unable to meet our costs.</LD>
<LD>   Medicare reimbursement is a serious problem as well, but there the
difficulty is more the complexity and sluggishness of a government
bureaucracy as opposed to the nimble variations on a shell game that
is employed by HMOs to delay or deny reimbursement claims filed by
doctors and hospitals for treatment they've provided their patients.</LD>
<TE>   Sometimes HMOs use so-called claim-denial quotas to pressure
reviewers into rejecting claims.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes they simply change the reimbursement rules without
notifying doctors, so that tests or treatments that were covered one
day aren't covered the next.</TE>
<TE>   And sometimes they sit on payments to benefit from the money held.</TE>
<TE>   In general, these big HMOs leverage the fact that they are,
indeed, big businesses.</TE>
<TE>   They know that most doctors will give in to the "hassle factor"
rather than go to the trouble and expense of trying to obtain proper
reimbursement from the HMO bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   This pervasive nickel-and-diming of doctors and hospitals adds up:
HMOs process more than 100 million claims a year, amounting to tens
of billions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   In private practice, doctors struggle to keep open their doors
when they can't count on being paid for the work they perform.</TE>
<TE>   In California alone, more than half of all physician groups are on
the verge of insolvency.</TE>
<TE>   Patients are hurt when HMOs use cost rather than medical necessity
in deciding to approve or deny coverage.</TE>
<TE>   By systematically siphoning off funds needed to pay for treatment,
these practices are undermining the foundations of our health-care
delivery system.</TE>
<TE>   It is upsetting when our electrocardiogram laboratory at one of
California's largest hospitals or my colleague's pediatric division
lose hundreds of thousands of dollars because of unpaid claims. We
need that money to maintain a high quality of medical care for our
patients, but much of it must be diverted to hire accountants to
track down unpaid claims.</TE>
<TE>   So what happens?</TE>
<TE>   The biggest component in hospital expenses is nursing salaries.
Consequently, hospitals are forced to cut back on nursing budgets.</TE>
<TE>   When you have fewer nurses, you have to close beds. When you have
fewer beds, patients pile up in emergency rooms.</TE>
<TE>   And when the emergency room gets clogged beyond capacity, it must,
by law, be placed on "divert," meaning it must turn away ambulances.</TE>
<TE>   This, in turn, pressures doctors to send patients home early to
free up beds.</TE>
<TE>   And patients released too early often experience complications and
end up calling an ambulance again.</TE>
<TE>   In frustration, doctors and several state medical associations
have turned to the courts for relief. The result is a landmark case
being pressed against some of the nation's largest for-profit HMOs.
The managed-care industry suffered a major setback last week when the
Miami federal judge overseeing the case certified the doctors' suit
as a class action.</TE>
<TE>   If you and I don't pay our insurance bills, in full and on time,
we're cut off.</TE>
<TE>   It's time that HMOs are required to meet the same standards as the
rest of us.</TE>

<LD>To the many crime statistics Los Angeles' new police chief will soon
be crunching, add No. 90. That's what Krystle Tashell White became
last week, one of 90 homicides so far this year in South Los Angeles'
77th Street Division.</LD>
<LD>   According to police, the 20-year-old Cerritos woman and a male
companion were driving near 83rd Street and Avalon Boulevard when a
group of teenage boys on bicycles rode alongside, yelling gang
challenges. Police believe she was trying to shield her 22-month-old
son when one of the teenagers shot her through the car window.</LD>
<LD>   Incongruous as it sounds, it's not unusual for armed boys on bikes
to prowl parts of Los Angeles. What sets this killing apart from the
usual carnage is that typically mothers are left to mourn lost sons,
not the other way around. As this young mother's life evaporates into
the ever-growing violent crime tallies, let's put 90 homicides in
perspective. The city of Oakland, population 399,500, has had 85
homicides citywide so far this year, and city officials have declared
a crisis. The LAPD'S 77th Street Division patrols 12 square miles
with about 175,000 residents. With fewer than 5% of the 3.7 million
people in Los Angeles, it accounts for almost 20% of the homicides.</LD>
<TE>   South Los Angeles' homicide numbers alone, as bad as they are,
don't tell the full toll. LAPD Capt. James Miller, who commands the
77th Division, estimates that shootings have wounded an additional
1,000 people. Whole neighborhoods live in fear. Families and friends
live with loss. Wednesday's Times carried a sobering story of
violence's rippling reach: A jury convicted a North Hollywood woman
of fatally beating her 4-year-old niece--she had reluctantly taken
custody of the child two years ago, after street gangsters killed the
girl's mother.</TE>
<TE>   We wrote last month that the most urgent task facing the
then-unnamed new police chief would be quelling a three-year surge in
homicides, more than half of them involving gangs. Police here and in
Oakland and everywhere cite the same reasons for the slaughter: a
crummy economy, waves of parolees returning to the streets and a
population bulge of adolescents, the most crime-prone age. To this,
the 77th Division's Miller adds, "Kids are hopeless. They don't care
if they get killed. They don't care if they kill someone."</TE>
<TE>   Former New York Police Commissioner William J. Bratton, whom Mayor
James K. Hahn named Thursday to take over the LAPD, cannot repair the
boyhood dreams knocked flat by poverty, absent fathers, criminally
inadequate schooling and a lack of jobs. But together, with real
commitment, the mayor and chief could hit the crisis with the
required one-two: a hard punch for the criminals, a guiding hand on
the shoulders of the boys who are not yet beyond salvation. Only by
busting criminals and arresting hopelessness will they make the
streets that failed Krystle Tashell White safe for her young son.</TE>

<LD>Mexico's Pemex monopoly is among the top oil producers in the world,
one of the three largest foreign suppliers of oil to the United
States and the Mexican government's main source of income. It also
belongs to the state and is attached to the political party that
encompasses the powerful Pemex union.</LD>
<LD>   For Mexican President Vicente Fox to address the corruption in
Pemex will take guts. To avoid it will cost him the respect of the
people.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, federal investigators charged three leaders of the Oil
Workers Union with diverting $170 million from Pemex to the 2000
presidential campaign of a candidate with the PRI party--the party
that had dominated Mexico for generations, the party that Fox drove
from power.</LD>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors have charged Rogelio Montemayor, a former
director general of Pemex, with authorizing the payment. The money
went through the union, which is a part of PRI. Also indicted are the
Pemex union boss, the union's treasurer and a union section chief.</TE>
<TE>   To add another convolution: One of these guys is a state
legislator, another a federal senator and the third in the Chamber of
Deputies--Mexico's equivalent of the U.S. House of Representatives.</TE>
<TE>   The accused claim they are victims of a witch hunt. The union is
backing them, and it is packed with hard-line PRI dinosaurs,
including a powerful senator who is the leading opponent of efforts
to privatize Pemex.</TE>
<TE>   Even inside Fox's camp are voices advising him to avoid a
confrontation with PRI, fearing that a frontal attack could
jeopardize a possible alliance in Mexico's Congress on pending
congressional reforms.</TE>
<TE>   We encourage the collision. When Fox took office, he promised to
solve the peasant uprising in Chiapas, but to this day, masked
Zapatistas hide in the hinterlands. Fox's fiscal reform bill fell
short of everyone's expectations, and terrorist fears in the United
States blew away Fox's hopes for an agreement with his northern
neighbor on immigration.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these failures, Fox remains popular. What the people won't
tolerate is a failure to uphold the rule of law.</TE>
<TE>   Fox must show that he is attacking the crisis that underlies most
of his nation's problems: corruption. He can do that by backing the
firm, fair prosecution of the union leaders.</TE>

<LD>Want a railroad line right to your gambling casino, built with
taxpayer money? Then pony up $250,000 to the Planning and
Conservation League to get the organization's Proposition 51 on the
Nov. 5 ballot. Want the state to buy your land in the Ballona Creek
area--land that cannot be developed? Donate $800,000 to the league.
Want a $2-million golf cart path along El Toro Road to Leisure World?
A highway interchange that will allow you to build thousands of new
homes? Get out the checkbook.</LD>
<LD>   Critics say the league used "pay-to-play" tactics to qualify
Proposition 51 for the ballot. A state senator called it pimping,
adding that legislators would be jailed for doing such a thing. Any
way you look at it, Proposition 51 is a bad idea spread across 19
pages of fine print that got on the ballot by dubious fund-raising
techniques. California voters should reject Proposition 51 without a
flicker of doubt.</LD>
<LD>   Even Gerald Meral, the league's executive director, admits that
"we picked projects where we thought people might contribute." The
measure allocates more than $250 million to 45 projects, including $1
million a year for a new charter school in Oakland and $12 million
for Lake Tahoe boats and docks.</LD>
<TE>   Even worse, the ballot measure robs the state's general fund of
about $1 billion a year in sales tax revenue to finance what is
laughably called the Traffic Congestion Relief and Safe School Bus
Trust Fund--actually 17 funds. In these dire financial times, the
Legislature would have to cut even further into education, health
care and other programs.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative shortcuts state and municipal priorities for
transportation projects. It substitutes the league's own wish list
for the public good. In many cases, local officials said projects on
the list were not a priority in their areas. Proposition 51 allocates
$30 million for four railroad grade crossings near the San Bernardino
airport where officials say there is no congestion.</TE>
<TE>   Only 8% of the fund, roughly $80 million, would go to buy new
school buses. But the measure gives more than $60 million to land
conservation programs under the pretense that the money offsets the
damage nearby highways have done to the environment.</TE>
<TE>   California needs to fight traffic congestion, but not with
Proposition 51. Vote no.</TE>

<HD>Walter Annenberg Was Good to Us</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When he died Oct. 1, Ambassador Walter Annenberg left behind one of
the greatest fortunes and art collections in the U.S. But more than
that, he left a legacy of public philanthropy and public service.
Annenberg always had the same reply when people told him that he was
the greatest philanthropist in America. He said, "This country's been
good to me." And it had been good to him. But his success, in
business and in life, did not come easily.</LD>
<LD>   As a young man, Annenberg stuttered. But by an act of iron will he
overcame this challenge and learned to speak with direct eloquence.
Eventually, he donated enormous resources to communication education
and research--because this country had been good to him.</LD>
<LD>   During his lifetime, Annenberg supported hundreds of charities,
but there were a few that carried his special signature. One was the
United Negro College Fund. The president of the fund, Christopher
Edley, approached Annenberg one day in 1990 to ask for $20 million.
After hearing the pitch, Annenberg told him he could not comply.
Then, Annenberg explained that $20 million was not enough for so
important a cause. He said that he intended to contribute $50 million
instead.</LD>
<TE>   The biggest challenge, Annenberg concluded, is K-12 education.
Some observers might have expected a leading Republican to use his
resources to support private schools or vouchers. But not Ambassador
Annenberg. Instead, he and his family donated $500 million to improve
public school education.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many philanthropists, the members of the Annenberg family
never created a large infrastructure for their philanthropy. They
have relied on their own hearts and their own instincts. In the
process, Walter, Lee and Wallis Annenberg have built some of the
greatest institutions in America, creating a legacy that will endure
and that has begun to inspire others who, like Ambassador Annenberg,
might say, "This country has been good to me."</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   During my many years of practice in Palm Springs, Annenberg was a
patient of mine. A quiet and humbly pleasant gentleman, he waited
without complaint to see me, even when I was running late. He
accepted my therapeutic suggestions readily. He had that "gravitas"
that physicians are supposed to have, but all too seldom attain. When
I retired, he sent me a most gracious note wishing me well. During
almost every visit he remarked to me: "I like your style." Walter
Annenberg, I liked your style as well.</TE>

<LD>It's refreshing to read about an Angeleno, a Valley resident no less,
who loves L.A. ("Valley Man Appreciates Waking Up in L.A.," Oct. 1).
I have to echo his sentiment: "In New York, you just sit on your
stoop and the world comes to you. In L.A. you have to ... go find
it." In defending L.A. to my East Coast friends who complain about
L.A.'s vastness, my reply is that they are used to being spoon-fed
their city and culture. It's all within easy reach.</LD>
<LD>   L.A. is an adventure. Culture is in the nooks and crannies of the
city. Don't be lazy and, for Pete's sake, think outside the box. So
L.A. doesn't fit the East Coast, traditional notion of a city.
Visitors who complain about L.A.'s barren culture may actually lack
the imagination and sense of adventure to go out and discover all the
wonderful experiences the city and Angelenos have to offer. Kudos to
people like Dick Healy, who understand and embrace L.A. in all its
quirky glory.</LD>

<LD>Kudos to Jerry Hirsch for his excellent but ultimately depressing
Sept. 28 article on the tropical fish industry, "Tropical Catch of
the Day." There are a lot of ways to make money. But efforts to
improve the ways in which the tropical fish are caught
notwithstanding, people like Walt Smith are making a lot of money by
selling something that does not belong to them. Moreover, their
actions represent just one more area in which human beings are
contributing not only to the demise of myriad species and natural
habitats on the planet but, ultimately, to our own demise.</LD>
<LD>   The solution, at least in this case, is for those who enjoy
aquariums in their homes to sacrifice that enjoyment for the sake of
the species in question and to put people like Smith out of a job.</LD>

<LD>"Senate Sets Debate on War Plans" (Oct. 2) concludes with the
statement that "many lawmakers say they are hearing mostly from
constituents opposed to going to war," and that one senator said, "My
phone calls are 200 to 2 against doing anything." While some public
opinion polls seem to indicate a majority in favor of attacking Iraq,
others indicate opposition.</LD>
<LD>   However, it is clear that an overwhelming majority of people who
care enough to either call or write to their representatives in
Washington are opposed to unilaterally starting a war with Iraq. The
Senate should take this large public opposition into account when
deciding whether to reverse the long-standing U.S. policy not to
start a war. At least I hope that the Senate puts some strings on the
hands of President Bush, as he certainly has no hesitation to ignore
the will of the people.</LD>

<TE>   "Unlike in '90, Fear of U.S. Defines U.N. Iraq Debate" (Oct. 1)
reminds us that "the United States has declined to join an
international criminal court and a global ban on land mines and to
sign the Kyoto Protocol to reverse the deterioration of the world's
environment." It reminds us also of the "uncompromising rhetoric
about acting unilaterally to oust Hussein." We evidently now have
even allies who are fearful of our governmental behavior. Evidently,
the way to increase homeland security is to maximize the number of
our enemies in the world while ignoring the destruction of the
planet's environment.</TE>
<TE>   It seems that we have a loose cannon on deck and, unfortunately,
there's nothing in the Constitution about what to do about loose
cannons. The dilemma is that Congress can't impeach a president
because he's endangering our nation and the rest of the planet. He
has to do something really serious--like former President Clinton
did.</TE>

<TE>   Ironic, isn't it? If our forces take out Saddam Hussein, we will
never know the horrors that awaited us at his hand. However, it may
be that the only evidence the left will accept to prove that Hussein
is a threat will be to see one of our cities in flames and our
population suffering the ravages of radiation sickness, poisonous gas
or a major epidemic. Even then, the left will blame the U.S. for the
attack on itself. Those who prefer to wait until we are attacked will
find a way to blame Bush and his administration for not doing
"something" to prevent the attack, when it was precisely their own
efforts that may have prevented the president from acting against
Hussein in time.</TE>

<TE>   I was disgusted by White House spokesman Ari Fleischer's coarse
remarks calling for someone to put a bullet in Hussein's head (Oct.
2). This is not how a great nation seeks to order world affairs. This
is how a cheap punk tries to get his way through threats and
intimidation. Do we really want a foreign policy that requires our
officials to talk and act like gangsters?</TE>

<LD>The first three installments of "Enrique's Journey" (Sept. 29, 30 and
Oct. 2) have been heart-wrenching for me to read. The story puts a
very human face on the tragedies from illegal immigration. So many
beatings, rapes and deaths could be avoided if the U.S. did not
implicitly encourage people to sneak across our borders.</LD>
<LD>   I hope that this series will change the opinions of the hypocrites
who claim to be pro-immigrant yet support policies that encourage
people to come here illegally. Discouraging illegal immigration,
through effective enforcement of immigration and employment laws,
would save lives.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I've been waiting eagerly to see the response from readers
regarding Enrique's story, and they did not disappoint (letters, Oct.
2). This series is not an expose on immigration; it's a feature on
what human beings endure to have some sense of honor and belonging
where there is little hope. It may not be "hard news," but it
certainly is eye-opening and worth reading.</TE>
<TE>   In a country where we take our homes, meals, clothes, cars, cheap
gas, etc., for granted, it is difficult to imagine the horrors of
what Enrique and others go through just to survive. Of course, many
Americans would rather not know about these atrocities so that they
don't sit on their consciences.</TE>
<TE>   We are more interested in pursuing wealth and protecting what's
ours than in helping those less fortunate. We shout righteously
against God being removed from our pledge but, given the chance to do
something truly righteous, we look the other way. So are we really a
Christian society after all?</TE>

<TE>   San Dimas</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While I'm sure your multi-part story concerning the unfortunate
boy Enrique is accurate, perhaps a story about a legal family's child
would be more appropriate. Sympathy for illegal immigrant criminals
is something we do not need.</TE>

<LD>I wholeheartedly agree with Jonathan Turley's Sept. 30 commentary, "A
Legal Tattoo Hullabaloo." Even if it is not what our founding fathers
had in mind, tattooing is a form of expression protected by the 1st
Amendment. It is unconstitutional to ban the practice in South
Carolina and Oklahoma. While the South Carolina Supreme Court claims
to have based its decision upholding the ban on body art on the
"public health danger" posed by tattoos, it fails to realize that
those who want to express themselves on their arms or chests will do
so, whether they have it done in safe, government-regulated parlors
or by illegal tattoo artists in unsterile conditions. The South
Carolina justices should focus on making the practice safer for those
who choose to tattoo themselves instead of making it illegal and
violating precious 1st Amendment rights.</LD>

<LD>"His Own Worst Enemy" (editorial, Oct. 2) overlooks several important
facts regarding the Israeli incursion into Ramallah. The purpose
behind this mission was to arrest many known terrorist leaders that
Yasser Arafat is harboring and who are behind the suicide bombings.
That Ariel Sharon executed the mission clumsily by bulldozing
buildings and not stating clearly what the goal was does not
obfuscate the correctness of the mission. The suicide bombing hiatus
that the Israelis enjoyed for six weeks only came about through many
Israeli security intercepts of attempted suicide bombings and not due
to any cessation on the part of the Palestinians.</LD>

<LD>DNA tests requested by a death row inmate provide strong evidence of
his guilt in the 1983 murders of a Chino Hills couple, their
10-year-old daughter and an 11-year-old house guest, state Atty. Gen.
Bill Lockyer said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Cooper, 44, was convicted in 1985 and sentenced to death for
the murders of Douglas and Perry Ryen, their daughter Jessica and her
friend, Christopher Hughes. The victims were stabbed and hacked
repeatedly with a knife, ax and ice pick.</LD>
<LD>   The killings occurred shortly after Cooper escaped from the nearby
California Institution for Men at Chino, where he had been serving a
burglary sentence.</LD>
<TE>   Cooper contended from the outset that although he stayed in a
vacant house near the Ryen home for two days after his escape, he had
nothing to do with the murders. He said he had never been inside the
sprawling hilltop ranch house in which the slayings occurred. The
evidence against Cooper was circumstantial, and the lone survivor of
the attack, an 8-year-old boy, gave conflicting testimony about the
killer's identity.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper's lawyers tried for years to get the state to perform DNA
analyses that were not available when he was sentenced, but the state
Supreme Court rejected the attorneys' requests for the tests. Then,
last year, acting under a recently enacted evidentiary law, the
attorney general's office agreed to order the tests.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer said the state Department of Justice laboratory tested
several pieces of crime scene evidence, including a drop of blood
found outside the bedroom where Doug and Peggy Ryen died, two
cigarette butts found in the Ryens' station wagon, which was believed
to have been the killer's getaway vehicle, and a bloodstained T-shirt
found outside a bar.</TE>
<TE>   "The results of this testing established a match between Kevin
Cooper's DNA and that found on the evidence from the murder scene,"
Lockyer said.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general's office said that although all the samples
matched to a great degree, some matched more than others. Officials
said that matching DNA samples is much like matching fingerprints:
the more corresponding points of comparison, the more certainty that
the samples came from the same source.</TE>
<TE>   Nathan Barankin, a spokesman for Lockyer, said the maximum match
was found between a sample of blood provided by Cooper and a sample
from the drop of blood found outside the bedroom. In that case,
Barankin said, the matching DNA codes are estimated to occur in about
1 in 310 billion African Americans.</TE>

<HD>Blackmail, Stolen Clients Alleged in Estranged Sports
Agents' Dispute</HD>
<DH>Courts: Leigh Steinberg is seeking $40 million in damages
from former business associate David Dunn, who denies the
accusations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Legendary sports agent Leigh Steinberg squared off against a former
business associate in federal court Thursday, accusing him of
stealing more than half of their firm's clients and then trying to
blackmail Steinberg to keep him from taking legal action.</LD>
<LD>   Steinberg is seeking more than $40 million in damages against
former associate David Dunn, who last year broke away from Steinberg,
his onetime mentor, along with five other key employees.</LD>
<LD>   In opening remarks to an eight-member jury in Los Angeles,
Steinberg's lawyer, Brock Gowdy, accused Dunn of violating a
five-year contract and stealing confidential records concerning
clients and potential recruits.</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, he charged that Dunn intended to use "private and
embarrassing" information about Steinberg to prevent him from
bringing a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Gowdy cited an e-mail message purportedly written by Brian Murphy,
a Dunn lieutenant, just before their sudden departure from the
Newport Beach firm.</TE>
<TE>   "Lee has a lot of secrets," the message said, alleging that he
drank a lot, had numerous extra-marital affairs and took medications
for sexual dysfunction.</TE>
<TE>   Gowdy said Dunn's new firm, Athletes First, hired a publicist for
$100,000 to disseminate that information if Steinberg tried to sue
them.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than succumb to intimidation, Steinberg made a "courageous
decision to pursue this case," Gowdy told the jury.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn's lawyer, Lee Hutton, denied that Dunn, Murphy or any other
defector had ever tried to blackmail Steinberg. He said Murphy was
simply "brainstorming" when he drafted the memo in preparation for a
meeting with a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "The mere fact that Brian Murphy thought about doing dumb things
doesn't mean they happened," Hutton said.</TE>
<TE>   "These cases are like divorces. Things get acrimonious. They get
personal."</TE>
<TE>   Hutton also denied that Dunn or anyone else in the departing group
took confidential records or solicited any of the firm's clients
before they quit.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of his resignation, Dunn handled all of the firm's
professional football players.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn, who had worked for Steinberg for a decade, decided to leave,
his lawyer said, in part because his boss had become "rude" and
"arrogant" and the operation was "dysfunctional." He said many of the
athlete clients were also disenchanted.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Dunn thought he had been cheated out of several
million dollars' worth of promised stock and money when Steinberg and
partner Jeff Moorad merged the firm in 1999 with Assante Corp. of
Canada in return for $79 million, Hutton said. Steinberg and Moorad
split the proceeds.</TE>
<TE>   Hutton said Dunn accepted a $2-million bonus in exchange for
agreeing to stay with the firm for at least five more years. But the
attorney said Dunn also received a verbal promise from Assante that
he would receive another $2.5 million in stock, along with more
money.</TE>
<TE>   After getting a runaround for more than a year, Hutton said, Dunn
decided that it was time to quit.</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg and Dunn are expected to testify in the trial, along
with a number of current and former football players.</TE>
<TE>   For the last quarter-century, Steinberg has represented some of
the biggest names in professional sports.</TE>
<TE>   He was a partial inspiration for the film "Jerry Maguire," in
which Tom Cruise played the role of a slick, hotshot sports agent who
has a crisis of conscience and persuades his clients to contribute
portions of their salaries to charity.</TE>
<TE>   Gowdy, his lawyer, estimated that Steinberg has negotiated more
than $1 billion in player contracts over his career.</TE>

<HD>Avila Moves to Postpone Hearing</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lake Elsinore man accused of kidnapping and killing 5-year-old
Samantha Runnion wants to postpone a preliminary hearing that will
determine if there is enough evidence to bring him to trial.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys representing Alejandro Avila filed a motion Thursday
asking for a delay of the proceeding, now scheduled for Oct. 11,
arguing that they need more time to comb over the 11,000-plus pages
of documents provided to date by prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant Public Defender Denise Gragg said in her motion that it
will take at least six more weeks to analyze DNA samples, cat hairs,
tire tracks, shoeprints and other forensic evidence collected in the
case.</LD>
<TE>   Gragg argues, without elaborating, that preliminary examinations
of the DNA tests "indicate that those results were obtained using
processes which violate the Orange County crime lab's own protocols."
She did not return calls seeking explanation.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County district attorney's office responded Thursday by
promising to file a brief fiercely opposing any postponement.</TE>
<TE>   A judge is scheduled to hear arguments from both sides Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Avila, 27, has pleaded not guilty to kidnapping, sexually
assaulting and killing Samantha. Prosecutors have said they will seek
the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha was abducted July 15 as she played with a friend near a
row of garages at her Stanton condominium complex. Her body was found
the next day along a mountain road between Orange County and the
Riverside County community of Lake Elsinore. She had been sexually
assaulted and strangled.</TE>

<HD>Blake Team Is Focusing on Inmates</HD>
<DH>Investigation: The actor's defense lawyers are studying
prisoners with whom Bonny Lee Bakley corresponded in their
investigation of her 2001 shooting death.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three months before her death, actor Robert Blake's wife was ordered
by federal authorities to stop sending sexually explicit material to
a convicted bank robber in a Pennsylvania prison, according to
documents.</LD>
<LD>   The letter from a prison official was among the thousands of pages
of personal documents seized by Los Angeles police after Bonny Lee
Bakley was shot to death on May 4, 2001, near a Studio City
restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   The materials were later turned over to Blake's criminal defense
attorney as part of the discovery process.</LD>
<TE>   Blake has been charged with Bakley's murder. But attorney Harland
W. Braun argues that many of the men whom Bakley allegedly scammed
out of money through her mail-order business also may have had motive
and opportunity to kill her.</TE>
<TE>   "We always thought [the killer] could be a disgruntled client,"
Braun said Thursday. "We didn't know so many of them were criminals."</TE>
<TE>   He criticized police for focusing their murder investigation on
Blake and for not thoroughly examining other potential suspects, such
as these prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Robison of the Los Angeles County district attorney's office
said the police investigation had been "extensive and thorough."</TE>
<TE>   "They traveled around the country and ruled out possible
suspects," Robison said. "It all came down to one person who was at
the [crime] scene. We believe the evidence will show that person was
Robert Blake."</TE>
<TE>   Blake has pleaded not guilty to murder, two counts of soliciting
Bakley's murder and conspiracy. He also denied the special
circumstance of lying in wait.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash
set a Monday hearing "to address the [California] Supreme Court
ruling" on whether Blake is entitled to a bail hearing, according to
a Superior Court spokesman, Kyle Christopherson.</TE>
<TE>   The high court ordered authorities on Wednesday to show why Blake
is not entitled to a bail hearing and set a Monday deadline for
action.</TE>
<TE>   The 69-year-old actor has been held without bail in Men's Central
Jail in downtown Los Angeles since his April 18 arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Nash has said he wanted to delay a bail hearing until evidence was
presented at the preliminary hearing, now set for Nov. 13.</TE>
<TE>   After Bakley was killed, Blake turned over to police trunkloads of
documents and dozens of cassette tapes that belonged to Bakley.</TE>
<TE>   Among her personal materials were letters from more than 140
inmates--including serial child molesters and murderers--incarcerated
across the nation, asking Bakley to write them letters.</TE>
<TE>   Many requested photographs of their new pen pal.</TE>
<TE>   While searching through her personal papers, Blake's private
investigators Scott Ross and Doyle Stepp say, they have documented
more than 130 aliases and addresses in at least 13 states and Canada
used by Bakley to correspond with men.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said she probably wrote to many more prisoners over the
years but kept only the most recent letters.</TE>
<TE>   Her death certificate describes Bakley, 44, as having been in the
"mail-order" business for 29 years.</TE>
<TE>   The letter-writers say they saw Bakley's photograph in
lonely-hearts magazines when they sought companionship or got her
address through other prison inmates.</TE>
<TE>   A typical letter, this one from a 26-year-old burglar in
Wisconsin, reads: "My reason for writing you is to answer this need
and impulse for companionship. I found your ad while paging thru
[sic] a singles magazine. I was captivated by your photo."</TE>
<TE>   Prison officials in Pennsylvania, however, were not thrilled with
Bakley's mail to Eduardo Madera, who is serving 78 months for bank
robbery and gun possession.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher M. Angelini, inmate systems manager at the Federal
Correctional Institution in Loretto, Pa., returned the package to
Bakley and, in a Feb. 16, 2001, form letter, said such items are
banned in federal prison.</TE>
<TE>   "The enclosed material(s) contain(s) sexually explicit information
or material or features nudity and is being returned to you," the
letter says.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman John Owen confirmed that prison officials had sent the
letter but declined to disclose immediately what specifically Bakley
had sent to Madera. "It could be either sexually explicit material or
nude pictures or both," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After Bakley's death, authorities confiscated hundreds of nude
photos of Bakley and others that she apparently had sent to customers
as part of her business.</TE>
<TE>   Besides these men, Braun said, his team also is investigating the
son of actor Marlon Brando, Christian Brando, who dated Bakley while
she was with Blake, as well as an armed robber who worked in the area
around where Bakley was killed.</TE>
<TE>   "We are doing the investigation that the police should have done,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bakley initially told Brando that he had impregnated her, but a
paternity test showed that Blake was the real father of Rose Lenore
Sophia Blake, now 2.</TE>
<TE>   Blake married Bakley in late 2000, after the child's birth.</TE>

<HD>Man Who Left Hurt Baby Is Sought</HD>
<DH>Accident: Deputies hunt Laguna Hills man after a two-car
crash that left his son critically injured. Residents chased the
suspect as he fled the scene toward a creek.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities on Thursday were searching for a 23-year-old Laguna Hills
man accused of running from an accident in which his baby son was
critically injured. Residents of the hilly Casa de Laguna
neighborhood of Laguna Hills, where the accident occurred Wednesday,
chased the man on scooters, bikes and on foot, but failed to find
him.</LD>
<LD>   The infant is in extremely critical condition at Children's
Hospital at Mission in Mission Viejo with multiple skull fractures
and a bruised lung, investigators said. Deputies are seeking the
driver, whom they identified as John Steidinger. He could face felony
hit-and-run charges.</LD>
<LD>   "He was the last known driver of the vehicle," said Jim Amormino,
spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department. "He is the
father of the child. He owns the car. He hasn't been heard or seen
from since [the crash]."</LD>
<TE>   Steidinger is on parole for assault with a deadly weapon and has a
record of other offenses, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   Steidinger was southbound in his Honda CRX on curvy Santa Vittoria
Drive near Camino Jalisco about 9 p.m. Wednesday when he veered into
a northbound lane and collided with a Toyota Camry, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   After the mangled car stopped on the sidewalk, Steidinger climbed
out of the driver's side window and ran toward a tree-lined creek,
authorities said. Witnesses, meanwhile, stopped to help his
7-month-old son, who was in a baby seat that was not secured.</TE>
<TE>   The man was driving about 45 mph in a 30 mph zone, Amormino said.
Two passengers in the Camry complained of pain and were treated at
the scene, deputies said.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Fleming, 25, and neighbor Eugene Hubbard, 37, were chatting
in a driveway when they heard the crash. Fleming dialed 911 while
Hubbard hopped on his son's bike and rode to the accident site,
where, he said, he saw a tall man running and holding his apparently
injured arm.</TE>
<TE>   "When I found the baby in the seat, it struck home and I pursued
after him," Hubbard said. "I was flabbergasted."</TE>
<TE>   Hubbard and Fleming ran to the creek, joined by neighbors holding
flashlights and residents walking their dogs.</TE>

<LD>A former successful plumbing business owner and his ex-wife were
convicted of fraudulently collecting more than $230,000 in welfare
payments over a 15-year period.</LD>
<LD>   The case was against Paul Lai of Rosemead and Sam Mui Luu, who
immigrated to the United States from Vietnam in 1979 and applied for
welfare the next year.</LD>
<LD>   After their divorce in 1987, Luu said she and Lai were living
apart, which was untrue, according to prosecutor Beatriz Dieringer.</LD>
<TE>   Lai, who ran a plumbing business in South El Monte, accumulated
more than $1 million in assets, including real estate, and the two
traveled to China while the welfare payments were being collected,
Dieringer said.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor called the motive "greed, plain and simple."</TE>

<LD>Police arrested 73 people and wrote 483 citations during a 20-hour
crackdown in a crime-plagued area of the north San Fernando Valley,
officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   More than 100 uniformed and undercover officers were deployed from
7 a.m. Wednesday to 3 a.m. Thursday in a target zone bordered by
Nordhoff Street, the San Diego Freeway, Roscoe Boulevard and
Wakefield Avenue, said Los Angeles Police Department Capt. John
Sherman, who was in charge of the operation.</LD>
<LD>   Most arrests involved misdemeanors such as drinking in public or
trespassing, police said. Seven arrests were drug-related and 14
involved driving under the influence.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said citations were issued primarily for vehicle
violations, including speeding and illegal turns.</TE>
<TE>   Police also impounded 45 vehicles because the drivers were not
licensed or did not have proper registration.</TE>

<HD>O.C.'s Clean-Fuel Buses Rack Up High Repair Bills</HD>
<DH>Environment: Fuel leaks, faulty valves and mechanical
failures plague the liquefied natural gas vehicles. Transit
authorities blame manufacturer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO and DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clean-fuel buses that make up 40% of the Orange County Transportation
Authority's fleet are plagued by mechanical problems, costing the
agency nearly $1 million in repair bills and forcing officials to
return pollution-spewing diesel buses to the streets.</LD>
<LD>   The OCTA bought 232 of the buses from a Hungarian manufacturer in
1998, when federal rules went into effect banning the purchase of
diesel buses and requiring all buses to run on clean fuel by 2010.
The cost was $80 million.</LD>
<LD>   But officials said the buses have been in constant need of repair
ever since. Most of the defects affect the fuel system, which runs on
liquefied natural gas. On Thursday, for example, 33 of the buses were
out of service and awaiting repairs.</LD>
<TE>   The authority is withholding a final $1.7 million payment to North
American Bus Industries, the manufacturer, until the problems are
resolved.</TE>
<TE>   "We paid good money for these buses and we expect them to
operate," OCTA Chief Executive Officer Art Leahy said.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy said the repairs were costing the authority at least
$900,000 in labor and materials. "They need to assure us that these
buses are going to be made ready for service, and we're going to
demand it. We'll do what we have to do to be made whole financially."</TE>
<TE>   OCTA is the 19th-largest transit agency in the United States. It
handled about 60 million riders last year on 79 routes. The OCTA has
523 buses in its fleet.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA inspectors discovered fuel leaks, faulty valves and rust soon
after the LNG buses were delivered, officials said. That led to a
series of increasingly terse letters between the agency and the
manufacturer about the problems and who was responsible to fix them.</TE>
<TE>   In June, North American President and CEO Patrick N. Z. Rona
accused Leahy of illegally withholding the final payment. He said
most bus manufacturers aren't profitable because public agencies like
OCTA refuse to pay their bills, then use the money to subsidize
operating costs.</TE>
<TE>   Rona didn't return a call Thursday to the company's U.S.
headquarters in Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   Similar mechanical problems have sidelined LNG buses in Phoenix,
the first transit agency in the country to use them. Workers there
have fixed fuel leaks and sticking valves on the buses, said Glenn
Kelly, an equipment analyst with the city's transit department.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the problems stemmed from equipment that Phoenix asked to
be used on the buses; others were design defects, Kelly said. The
city has about 300 LNG buses out of 700 total.</TE>
<TE>   "When we first got the buses, they were less than responsive," he
said. "Since then, the quality has improved."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica's Big Blue Bus system received 37 LNG buses in April.
A spokesman said the buses have been running fine.</TE>
<TE>   In March, OCTA formed a technical team to investigate the buses'
faulty fuel system. Problems included recurring leaks in fittings and
valves, malfunctioning vaporizers that were sending liquid fuel into
the engines, failing methane detectors and malfunctioning fuel tanks.</TE>
<TE>   The gas is stored in two, 115-gallon tanks. It is kept at
minus-200 degrees Fahrenheit, then heated and vaporized before it
flows to the engine.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials said they spent $100,000 to replace leaking fuel
pipes and had to redesign the fuel-delivery system.</TE>
<TE>   Workers then replaced some of the buses' methane-detection
devices. Inspectors recently discovered a new problem: Linings in the
double-hulled fuel tanks are failing to keep the fuel properly
chilled.</TE>
<TE>   Though the fuel system appears fine on paper, officials said, it
simply hasn't held up to the constant jarring, bouncing and
vibrations experienced in daily use.</TE>
<TE>   The OCTA used federal grant money to purchase the buses. But the
OCTA may be forced to partially reimburse the federal government if
the buses don't last 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   "There are certain responsibilities that we feel the manufacturer
needs to take," OCTA Vice Chairman Tim Keenan of Cypress said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's particularly aggravating because you expect a product to be
delivered and have everything work."</TE>

<HD>Firm Skirts Radio Caps in San Diego</HD>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Federal regulations prohibit any broadcaster from owning more than
eight radio stations in a single market. But here along California's
southern border, industry giant Clear Channel Communications Inc. has
figured out a way around the rules--and that has left its smaller
competitors fuming.</LD>
<LD>   By cutting deals to take over programming of five Mexican
stations, including two in May, Clear Channel has grabbed nearly 50%
of the San Diego market's radio advertising dollars, according to
estimates from research firm BIA Financial. The Federal
Communications Commission exempts foreign-owned stations from being
counted toward the maximum of eight.</LD>
<LD>   Altogether, the exemption and other loopholes have allowed Clear
Channel to take control of 13 stations beaming signals into San
Diego. The San Antonio-based company--the nation's biggest radio
broadcaster--has more market share here than in any other top-20
market, according to BIA.</LD>
<TE>   With antennas within sight of the U.S.-Mexico border and signals
directed north, Clear Channel's so-called X stations (the Mexican
outlets' names start with X) have become the key to a power struggle
in San Diego radio.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller radio companies protest that the media conglomerate has
not only sidestepped federal law by taking over the Mexican stations,
but that it is using its size to muscle advertisers. Critics say
Clear Channel is throwing its weight around with advertisers in
dozens of other markets where it has concentrated power.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson-Pilot Communications, a small broadcaster that owns four
San Diego radio stations, said in a complaint filed with the FCC in
March that the exemption Clear Channel is exploiting "has resulted in
a serious competitive imbalance" in San Diego and permitted "the very
market dominance Congress sought to preclude" by establishing
station-ownership caps.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson-Pilot has asked the FCC to revise its rules and count
any station that places a signal into a U.S. radio market and directs
significant programming and sales efforts there.</TE>
<TE>   In its basic pitch, Clear Channel tries to sell advertisers on the
idea that, if they spend all their radio dollars on the company's
stations, they would receive bonuses, such as free spots on its
lower-rated stations.</TE>
<TE>   Even if they reject the idea of handing their entire ad account to
one company, some media buyers in San Diego say they must buy spots
on Clear Channel's stations because it has tied up control of certain
coveted demographic groups, including men ages 18 through 34. Some
advertisers say that means they must pay Clear Channel's price--or
stay off the air.</TE>
<TE>   "I can get proposals from five or six different Clear Channel
stations and they're like carbon copies," said veteran San Diego ad
buyer J.C. Cordero. "For someone targeting certain demographics, they
really have you between a rock and a hard place. It's David and
Goliath, and right now Goliath is winning."</TE>
<TE>   John Hogan, recently appointed chief of Clear Channel's
1,200-station radio division, said his company's size has actually
helped media buyers by allowing them to engage in one-stop shopping.
Some, he said, find that desirable.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he denied that his sales force strong-arms
advertisers in any way. "We don't insist people buy one station to
get another one," Hogan said in a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Glickenhaus, Clear Channel's market manager for San Diego,
added: "This gives us an opportunity to sell to advertisers who are
looking for a specific demographic and give them more choices. We
have never presented anyone with forced combinations. We know they've
still got lots of choices."</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel acquired control of the Mexican stations through a
so-called exclusive sales agreement, in which the company pays a fee
to the license holder in exchange for the right to sell airtime for
and program the station.</TE>
<TE>   The antennas for the Mexican stations tower over an impoverished
Tijuana neighborhood just five miles south of the border.</TE>
<TE>   But the bulk of these stations broadcast from a sleek, glass
office building in northern San Diego where Clear Channel houses its
U.S. license stations.</TE>
<TE>   For listeners, discerning between Clear Channel's Mexican stations
and its stations on this side of the border is difficult.</TE>
<TE>   One promotes itself as San Diego's "hit music channel" and plays
the latest offerings from Shakira and Justin Timberlake.</TE>
<TE>   Another is "your home for hip hop and R&amp;B," thumping out Jay-Z and
Nelly. Another station, which advertises itself as "My '80s, My '90s,
My Music," plays softer hits by such acts as Michelle Branch.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, the only clue that radio here is different
comes just once an hour, during government-mandated station
identification breaks.</TE>
<TE>   On the hip-hop outlet known locally as Z90, for example, a young
Latina voice breaks in between songs by Sean Combs and Jay-Z to say
"XHTZ, Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Mexican licensed stations must air speeches by
Mexican President Vicente Fox and must devote time each week to
Mexican public affairs programming.</TE>

<HD>Police Tape Played for Jury</HD>
<DH>Trial: Witness testifies she can't recall, but in a
recorded interview she told authorities murder defendant talked of
beating homeless man.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Oak View teenager charged with murder told friends that after
participating in a mob beating of a homeless man, he returned and
kicked the transient in the head as he lay wounded in his sleeping
bag, according to testimony.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Coffman, 19, told one friend that he asked the man: "Do you
want a deeper sleep?" before stomping on his face, according to
testimony in Coffman's trial Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Coffman is one of four teens accused of fatally beating and
robbing homeless veteran James Clark, 58, as they headed to a beach
party last year.</LD>
<TE>   All four defendants, ages 14 to 19, were charged with robbery and
murder. The youngest was convicted earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, jurors in Coffman's trial heard testimony about
comments he allegedly made two days after the June 30, 2001, slaying.</TE>
<TE>   A girl, now 16, told police that Coffman described the assault on
Clark to her and other friends as they sat in front of a west Ventura
apartment complex where the boys often hung out.</TE>
<TE>   "He told us he'd beaten him," said Monique Gonzalez, according to
a tape-recorded interview. "He kicked him in the head, he stomped him
in the face."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez told Ventura Police Det. Russell Robinson that Coffman,
Rocky Mattley, Timothy Becker and Christopher Dunham beat the
transient and threw rocks at him, according to the recording.</TE>
<TE>   Coffman told her he later approached Clark, who was bleeding and
snoring, and asked him, "You want a deeper sleep?"</TE>
<TE>   He then kicked Clark again and stomped on his face, Gonzalez told
police.</TE>
<TE>   In the interview, she also said that the boys robbed Clark after
the beating, or in her words, "They jacked the bum."</TE>
<TE>   Called as a witness Thursday, Gonzalez testified that she could
not recall any statements Coffman made to her after the slaying, nor
could she remember any statements she made during the July 12
interview with Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   She denied being threatened or persuaded not to testify, insisting
she was telling the truth.</TE>
<TE>   Moments after Gonzalez stepped off the stand, Deputy Dist. Atty.
Stacy Ratner called Robinson as a witness and played the
tape-recorded interview for the jury.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Monique Gonzalez's younger sister testified that she
heard the boys talking about how they beat a homeless man.</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie Gonzalez said Coffman told her he stomped and kicked the
victim. She testified, "I guess he was just sort of proud of what he
did."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys both days tried to show that the girls'
statements were based on secondhand information, overheard
conversations and exaggerated claims by some of the boys.</TE>
<TE>   Coffman is also charged with attempted murder in the stabbing of
Daniel McGrath, 19, at the Ventura beach promenade a day after
Clark's slaying.</TE>
<TE>   In other testimony Thursday, Ventura Police Det. Tom Radwan
testified that during an interview Coffman admitted stabbing McGrath
but told police he was trying to defend his friend, Kenny Valentine.</TE>
<TE>   Coffman told Radwan that McGrath and Valentine, 15 at the time,
got into a fight at the promenade and that he stabbed McGrath to get
him off Valentine.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, McGrath testified that Coffman, Valentine and a
third person attacked him during an argument. He told jurors he did
not provoke the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony is scheduled to resume today in Ventura County Superior
Court.</TE>

<HD>Firm Wants Out of College District Suit</HD>
<DH>Courts: Ventura lawyers in the case over alleged misuse of
public money claim conflict of interest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing a conflict of interest, a Ventura law firm wants to withdraw
its name from a lawsuit filed on behalf of county taxpayers that
claims widespread abuse of public money by the Ventura County
Community College District.</LD>
<LD>   In a motion filed recently in Superior Court, lawyers with Benton,
Orr, Duval &amp; Buckingham said they have a conflict because they
represent Santa Paula in three cases involving its Police Department
and Police Chief Bob Gonzales, a college district trustee. Gonzales
is a defendant in the taxpayer lawsuit.</LD>
<LD>   The issue is significant because the lawsuit contains allegations
that could result in the ouster of embattled Chancellor Philip
Westin, the target of criticism over his spending practices. Trustees
Norman Nagel, Art Hernandez and Allan Jacobs also are defendants in
the suit.</LD>
<TE>   If the motion is granted, taxpayers will still be represented by
co-counsel, the Quisenberry Law Firm, based in Century City, court
documents state.</TE>
<TE>   Lead plaintiffs Gerald Leavitt, an employee with Conejo Valley
Unified School District, and Gerard Kapuscik, an information
technology manager for the county, said they don't believe a conflict
exists.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a legal conflict, but they [lawyers] probably see a
business conflict," Kapuscik said.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales has said that as far as he is concerned, there is no
conflict. He said the college district's lawyer, Jack Lipton,
determined shortly after the lawsuit was filed in July that his
status as police chief for the city and a trustee for the district
posed no problem.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a moot issue," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, a Superior Court judge reached a similar conclusion in
January involving a different lawsuit filed against the district by
the Ventura law firm. In that lawsuit, filed on behalf of four
district employees, Judge Henry Walsh determined that the city of
Santa Paula had been the firm's client in the past, not Gonzales as
an individual.</TE>
<TE>   "He was not the client with whom Benton, Orr, Duval &amp; Buckingham
had a professional relationship," Walsh said in his ruling. "The
motion is denied."</TE>
<TE>   What is different this time is that Gonzales is named individually
as a defendant, said Mark Borrell, an attorney with the Ventura law
firm. The firm is handling three cases involving the Santa Paula
Police Department and Gonzales is the primary contact, lawyer
Terrence Bonham said in court papers.</TE>
<TE>   Borrell said the firm's partners are particularly concerned that
its involvement in the taxpayer lawsuit represents an ethical
violation under the State Bar of California rules of professional
conduct.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that this firm's relationship with Chief Gonzales
presents at least a potential conflict of interest, which requires
our withdrawal from the action, in which Chief Gonzales is a
defendant," Bonham said in court papers. "I understand that it is the
firm's ethical obligation to avoid not only actual conflicts of
interest but also the appearance of conflicts."</TE>
<TE>   The class-action lawsuit alleges that college trustees, Westin and
other top district administrators misspent hundreds of thousands of
dollars in public money on vacations, golf trips and illegal bidding
procedures. The lawsuit was filed after it was revealed that Westin
was reimbursed $119,000 for business-related expenses over four
years.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing on the Ventura law firm's motion to withdraw from the
case is set for Oct. 17.</TE>

<LD>Making an already dicey environmental cleanup even worse, a canister
once used as part of a fighter jet's ejection seat blew up this week
at a notorious hazardous waste storage facility in Rialto, injuring
two contract workers, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigators
descended Thursday on the 20-acre compound in the San Bernardino
County community. The site, once operated by Denova Environmental
Inc., had such a poor maintenance record that waste there once
spontaneously caught fire.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday afternoon, workers were preparing to detonate a
canister of chemicals and compounds that was designed to fuel an
ejection on a fighter jet. Without warning, the canister exploded,
said Mark Merchant, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency spokesman.</LD>
<TE>   Injuries from the explosion sent two men to nearby Arrowhead
Regional Medical Center, Merchant said. Both men work for EPA
contractors that are attempting to clean up the property.</TE>
<TE>   One worker, from the Denver-based engineering and construction
management firm CH2M Hill, was burned on his right forearm. Company
spokeswoman Patty Keck declined to release his identity, but said he
has been released from the hospital and is "doing really well."</TE>
<TE>   The second man, also not identified, works for Long Beach-based
Earth Tech, a water management, transportation, engineering and
environmental services firm. He was burned over 50% of his body and
remained hospitalized Thursday, the EPA's Merchant said.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the OSHA workers, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's
Department and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms have
launched an investigation, Merchant said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials had hoped to finish cleaning up the site by Oct. 15, but
their efforts have been put on hold because of the probe.</TE>

<HD>Escaped Murderer Is Charged in Carjack Attack</HD>
<DH>Crime: Marvin Sandoval was among three teens who fled
Juvenile Hall with a gun July 31. The car was found later. Another
youth broke out of custody last week.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A convicted murderer who escaped with two other inmates from Central
Juvenile Hall has been charged with stabbing a woman during a brutal
carjacking, authorities said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles police detectives said the victim identified Marvin
Alexander Sandoval, 17, as her assailant in the Aug. 6 carjacking.
Her vehicle was later recovered near the border with Mexico, police
said.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Rene Argueta, 18, a Los Angeles street gang member, led the
July 31 escape from the central hall in Lincoln Heights by
overpowering unarmed guards with a handgun smuggled into the
facility. Using a ladder and sheets, Argueta, Sandoval and a
convicted carjacker, Fernando Nupiri, 18, scaled the hall's 20-foot
wall.</LD>
<TE>   Probation officials acknowledged Wednesday that another juvenile
escaped last Thursday from a psychiatric facility. The 18-year-old is
the second inmate to escape while on a visit to an outside medical
facility, and brings to five the number who have escaped while under
the supervision of the facility.</TE>
<TE>   Six days after Sandoval fled, investigators said, he assaulted a
woman in the 1200 block of South Redondo Boulevard. Detectives said
Sandoval demanded her keys, stabbed her in the stomach and drove away
with her car, leaving her bleeding. The woman, according to law
enforcement sources, suffered deep wounds despite having offered no
resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Police in National City, in San Diego County, found the car a few
days later.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of his escape, Sandoval was awaiting sentencing for a
murder that occurred in the same area of Los Angeles as the
carjacking.</TE>
<TE>   That escape began when Argueta asked guards to release him from a
locked room in a special housing unit for the most violent inmates so
he could get a drink of water. Once outside, he produced a
.45-caliber handgun and forced three guards to release Sandoval and
Nupiri.</TE>
<TE>   After locking the guards in a utility room, the three fled to an
outside yard and used a 5-foot ladder from a utility closet placed on
a 3-foot tree stump to climb to a rooftop. They then scaled a
perimeter wall.</TE>
<TE>   Argueta was previously convicted of first-degree murder and
conspiracy in the shooting of a 27-year-old former leader of an
Armenian street gang at a Hollywood Boulevard deli. He was awaiting
sentencing when he escaped.</TE>
<TE>   After the escape, the county Board of Supervisors asked the county
Probation Department, which runs the juvenile halls, to work with the
sheriff's custody division to find room in the county jails to house
teenagers convicted of adult crimes and awaiting sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent escape was of an 18-year-old from Ingleside, a
Rosemead psychiatric facility, said Ken Kondo, a Probation Department
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Kondo said the juvenile, who was awaiting trial for drug
possession, escaped through a window.</TE>

<HD>Light Rail Costs Up Sharply</HD>
<DH>Transportation: A projected increase of $288 million for
two lines causes concern.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The price tag for two planned Los Angeles light-rail lines has
increased by a combined $288 million, resurrecting concern about the
county transit agency's ability to control spending and questions
about whether an outside builder should be created to construct one
of the railways.</LD>
<LD>   According to an internal Metropolitan Transportation Authority
memo obtained by The Times, projected costs for the Expo Line
railway, which would connect downtown Los Angeles with Santa Monica,
have shot up $202 million since last year. The expected cost is now
one-third higher than when the agency's board gave approval last
summer to a first phase of the line, which is to end in Culver City.</LD>
<LD>   The new cost estimates put the price for the first segment of the
Expo Line at $632 million.</LD>
<TE>   The same memo, a briefing to top MTA officials on the state of the
projects, showed projected costs for the Eastside Line, a six-mile
railway from downtown into East Los Angeles, have risen $86 million.
Construction is scheduled to begin next year.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the Expo Line, which is still being engineered and
is three years from the start of construction, the new projection
makes some officials worry that the railway is in for years of
spiraling costs. The line was conceived as a cost-effective and
predictable project, because it would use an existing right of way
and run almost entirely at street level.</TE>
<TE>   The revised Eastside Line estimate is considered less surprising,
because the railway would involve complicated tunneling in Boyle
Heights and because projections often increase as the construction
date approaches. Also, the addition of $86 million is a relatively
small slice of a project that will cost taxpayers nearly $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   At the MTA, an agency known for large construction cost overruns,
the new numbers are being downplayed. MTA officials say the revised
projections reflect more accurate accounting and changes in the
economy. The matter has not been a topic of conversation at recent
MTA board meetings, and some board members know little about it.</TE>
<TE>   However, two MTA board members, Zev Yaroslavsky and Yvonne
Brathwaite Burke, who are also Los Angeles County supervisors whose
districts will include the Expo Line, made clear this week that they
were deeply troubled.</TE>
<TE>   Burke said she was disturbed that the railway costs have risen so
much since the MTA board approved the project last summer.
Yaroslavsky compared the two planned railways with the Pasadena Gold
Line, a 14-mile railway connecting Pasadena and downtown that is set
to open next summer.</TE>
<TE>   The Gold Line is being built by a construction authority with no
ties to the MTA and a clear mission: Get the job done fast and on
budget. The authority was created by the Legislature in 1998, because
attempts by the MTA to build the line were proving too costly. So
far, the authority is delivering. The railway should open next summer
with few, if any, cost overruns.</TE>
<TE>   "The MTA is headed for trouble on this one. Our costs are out of
line and outpacing not only the national norms, but what is happening
in Pasadena," Yaroslavsky said. The Gold Line is being built for $62
million per mile; the Expo Line's cost for new track is now projected
at $84 million per mile. "The agency is doing a lot of things better
recently, but it's becoming clear that it does not know how to build
light rail," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the MTA's revised estimates, costs for engineering, consulting
and extra staffing have doubled. Contingency costs, to cushion blows
from construction foul-ups, are more than four times as high as
previously estimated. The price the MTA expects to pay for
construction of the rails is six times as high. The MTA expects to
pay nearly $4.7 million per light-rail car, about twice what most
transit agencies spend.</TE>
<TE>   "We've just taken a more detailed look at the budget, and we are
more comfortable with these numbers," said James de la Loza, director
of MTA planning. De la Loza said the agency would do everything it
could to keep costs from ballooning further.</TE>
<TE>   Costs could easily rise. USC wants the railway tunneled near its
campus, and the agency is studying whether it makes sense to build
bridges or trenches for the line as it crosses at least four heavily
congested intersections on Exposition Boulevard. That might improve
safety, but it would also increase costs--by $5 million to $20
million per intersection.</TE>
<TE>   Worried that the costs could keep rising, the MTA has decided to
create an overview body that will review design and budget.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky said this week that might not be enough. Stating that
the MTA's design plans are too lavish and that the agency is planning
for too much unnecessary staff, he said he would back the creation of
another building authority similar to that created for the Pasadena
railway.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Yaroslavsky approached state Sen. Sheila Kuehl
(D-Santa Monica), whose district the line goes through, asking her
whether she would sponsor legislation to wrestle construction from
the MTA.</TE>
<TE>   Kuehl, a longtime proponent of the railway, said she might do so.
"I was shocked to see how costs have gone up," she said. "These cost
increases make you think there is almost some agenda to keep the line
from being built. You look at the way costs have gone up and you
think, 'What, are they building this thing on quicksand?' "</TE>

<HD>Margarita Flores, 92; Watts' 'Walking Example of Love'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Margarita Calderon Flores, whose willingness to shelter children in
need of a home earned her the title Mexican Mother of the Year, died
of cancer Monday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 92.</LD>
<LD>   Flores raised four sons and was a surrogate mother to more than a
dozen nieces, nephews and other children. She opened her home in
Watts to others even through the Depression, and many stayed until
they had families of their own.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know how we packed everyone into that house," Flores said
last year. "It was like a hotel!"</LD>
<TE>   Last year, she became the 50th recipient of the annual Mexican
Mother of the Year Award, established by the Franciscan Sisters
Mission Guild and a group of Mexican mothers to recognize outstanding
examples of Mexican American motherhood.</TE>
<TE>   Father Peter Banks, her pastor at St. Lawrence of Brindisi Church
in Watts, called her "a walking example of love" and a devoted
community worker who was more energetic than women 20 years her
junior.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Old Zoquititan, Sinaloa, Mexico, she moved to Arizona with
her family in 1922. She later settled in Watts with her American-born
husband, Luis. They were married for 37 years until his death about
30 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Together they managed to support their extended family--he by
selling vegetables at the 7th Street Market downtown, she as a
seamstress who also sewed all the children's clothes.</TE>
<TE>   The great-great-grandmother was also a prolific volunteer, who
donated time to the American Red Cross as a translator and to
Catholic Charities of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles County
Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   For 25 years Flores was a member of the secular Franciscan order,
a multicultural group of Catholic laypeople who perform community
service.</TE>
<TE>   At 91, she was cooking tamales for the children in the parish
school at St. Lawrence. She was an institution at the parish bazaar,
where last year she was still selling homemade burritos, tacos and
nachos. Her booth raised more money than any other.</TE>
<TE>   The worst anyone could say about Flores was that she could be
strict. Her grandchildren sometimes called her the
"sergeant-at-arms."</TE>
<TE>   "She was no pushover," Father Banks said. Yet children adored her.
"I told them, 'When you look at her,' " the pastor said, " 'you are
looking at the face of a saint.' "</TE>
<TE>   Flores outlived her four children as well as her husband. She is
survived by 17 grandchildren, 29 great-grandchildren and 10
great-great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A funeral Mass will be said at 10 a.m. today at St. Lawrence of
Brindisi Church, 10122 Compton Ave., Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Charles H. Ford, 94; Poet Founded 2 Influential Literary
Magazines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles Henri Ford, founding editor of the influential literary
magazines Blues and View and a Surrealist poet who also dabbled in
novels, photography and collages, has died. He was 94.</LD>
<LD>   Ford, who wrote 16 books of poetry and co-authored what is
considered the first gay novel, "The Young and Evil," died Sept. 27
in Manhattan of causes associated with aging. He had at various times
maintained homes in Paris; Crete, Greece; and Katmandu, Nepal.</LD>
<LD>   The eclectic Ford's peripatetic life and his own reminiscences of
hobnobbing with Gertrude Stein, Paul Bowles and Andy Warhol among
others was chronicled in the two-hour documentary film "Sleep in a
Nest of Flames" released last year.</LD>
<TE>   Made by John Kolomvakis and James Dowell over an eight-year
period, the movie has been shown at the San Francisco Lesbian &amp; Gay
Film Festival in 2001 and similar gatherings across the country.</TE>
<TE>   According to Variety reviewer Dennis Harvey, the film reveals
Ford's life as a "glam-observer" more than an accomplished writer or
artist.</TE>
<TE>   "A gadfly in the upper echelons of the U.S./European avant-garde
from the late 1920s through the present," Harvey wrote, "Charles
Henri Ford fascinates for his connections to myriad lasting talents.
His own artistic output is of lesser interest.... Perhaps he's simply
just what he appears: an old-school aesthete, content to have lived
on reflected glory and dilettantish activity."</TE>
<TE>   Ford himself wrote one screenplay, for "Johnny Minotaur" released
in 1972 and produced an underground art film, "Poem Posters" in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   Born to a wealthy hotel-owning family in Hazelhurst, Miss., he
published his first poem in the New Yorker when he was a teenager. He
also began the short-lived but influential Blues: A Magazine of New
Rhythms, in 1929 while still living under his parents' roof. Designed
to showcase avant-garde literature, its mere eight issues published
articles by Stein and Edward Roditi and was the first to print work
by Bowles, James T. Farrell and Erskine Caldwell.</TE>
<TE>   Ford moved to New York in 1930, joining his future collaborator
Parker Tyler, with whom he wrote the groundbreaking novel "The Young
and Evil" about bohemian gay and lesbian life in Greenwich Village.</TE>
<TE>   Published in France in 1933, the book was banned in the United
States and England for decades. Stein raved that the book "creates
this generation as 'This Side of Paradise' by [F. Scott] Fitzgerald
created his generation."</TE>
<TE>   Ford, a homosexual, also met lesbian writer Djuna Barnes, 19 years
his senior, and later moved into her apartment in Paris. He also
traveled widely with her, including a long residence in Bowles'
enclave in Tangier, Morocco, where she wrote and he typed the drafts
of her novel "Nightwood."</TE>
<TE>   So handsome that he was often used as a model by photographers
such as Cecil Beaton, the pixieish Ford slid easily into the
avant-garde communities in New York and Europe. In Paris, he met his
companion of a quarter-century, Russian expatriate artist Pavel
Tchelitchew.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's final book, published last year, was "Water from a Bucket,"
the diary he kept from 1948 until Tchelitchew's death in 1957.</TE>
<TE>   A reviewer for the Memphis Commercial Appeal, echoing Variety's
appraisal of Ford's life based on the documentary, commented: "We
don't read nearly as much about his actual working methods when it
comes to poetry, and later drawing, as we do about his eating and
drinking, his search for places to live, his alliances or enmities
with other writers ... and Ford's ponderings on love, desire and the
sexual act itself.... "</TE>
<TE>   The book was a virtual compendium of name-dropping as Ford
recounted socializing with his friends: Stein, Bowles, Warhol, Max
Ernst, George Balanchine, Thornton Wilder, Isak Dinesen, Marianne
Moore, Paul Cadmus, Lincoln Kirstein, Jean Genet and Jean Cocteau.</TE>
<TE>   After returning to the U.S. in 1939, Ford worked again with Tyler
to create View, the magazine that was published from 1940 to 1947.</TE>
<TE>   Featuring art and literature, the magazine exhibited stunning
covers by such artists as Ernst, Man Ray, Yves Tanguy, Georgia
O'Keeffe and Alexander Calder. It was the first to publish Cadmus'
and Genet's work in English.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's recent years were devoted primarily to writing haiku poetry
and making collages.</TE>
<TE>   Recent exhibits have included Ford's photographs in 1997 at New
York's Leslie Tonkonow Gallery and his "Poem Posters" from the 1960s
in 1999 at the city's Ubu Gallery. A show called "Alive and Kicking:
the Collages of Charles Henri Ford" is planned by Manhattan's Scene
Gallery next month.</TE>
<TE>   Exhibitions of his art and photography have also been staged by
galleries in Paris, London and Amsterdam.</TE>
<TE>   Ford, who changed the spelling of his middle name from "Henry" to
"Henri" to avoid any confusion with the Ford Motor Co. family, is
survived by his sister, stage actress Ruth Ford.</TE>

<HD>Officials Detail Plans to Close Much of San Bernardino
Forest</HD>
<DH>Outdoors: Most of the mountainous areas in Southern
California could be off limits because of fire danger. Some
campsites, picnic areas will stay open.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal forest officials laid out detailed plans Thursday for
shutting down much of the San Bernardino National Forest, calling it
a drastic step forced by rare drought conditions and the enormous
threat of wind-swept wildfires.</LD>
<LD>   By the end of next week, virtually all of Southern California's
popular national forests--nearly 2 million acres of soaring peaks,
chaparral and timber stands that provide a mountainous escape from
urban areas--could be shut down or placed under severe restrictions,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The closures began last week when the U.S. Forest Service closed
the Angeles National Forest for the first time since 1993 after a
raging wildfire erupted above the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys and
blanketed the region with smoke. Today, federal officials plan to
shut down most of the neighboring San Bernardino National Forest.</LD>
<TE>   Next week, officials will consider implementing similar
restrictions in the Cleveland National Forest, which includes giant
chunks of Orange, Riverside and San Diego counties. Authorities there
said they anticipate that restrictions similar to those in the San
Bernardino National Forest will eventually be in place, but they
emphasized that a decision has not been reached.</TE>
<TE>   Even in Los Padres National Forest, farther north, closer to the
coast and more buffered from the drastic conditions in the southern
reaches of the state, officials say they may have to eventually
consider similar closures.</TE>
<TE>   "We're keeping an eye on conditions," said Los Padres spokeswoman
Kathy Good. "We're not there yet. But we could get there."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of what happens at the Cleveland and Los Padres
forests, officials say, it is an extraordinary year. Several
government measuring sites have detected less precipitation this year
than any year in more than a century, and firefighters say blazes are
burning with particular ferocity this season.</TE>
<TE>   "As an agency, we are profoundly sorry to have to do this. There
is really no other way to say it," Forest Service spokesman Matt
Mathes said of the forest closures.</TE>
<TE>   "We are all recreationists. We think we can understand how people
feel about this. But we are entering into the most dangerous time of
year in Southern California with the Santa Ana winds.... Anything we
can do to reduce the risk of wildfires and protect the public will be
a good move in the long run."</TE>
<TE>   Though the response from mountain residents and outdoors
enthusiasts has been understanding for the most part, San Bernardino
National Forest managers exercised some damage control Thursday by
emphasizing the wilderness spots that will remain open, not those
that will close.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning at noon today, officials said, most remote areas of the
671,686-acre forest will be off-limits to hikers, horseback riders,
hunters, mountain bikers and others.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Forest Service said it will allow use of many
campsites and other areas that are near good roads that are easily
accessible to firefighters. Most sites within a quarter-mile of state
highways and county roads will stay open, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Remaining open in the Big Bear area, for example will be the Big
Bear Discovery Center, the Serrano and Pineknot campgrounds, and the
Meadows Edge, Grout Bay and Aspen Glen picnic areas. At Lake
Arrowhead, the Dogwood Campground and the Baylis, Crest Park and
Switzer picnic areas also will stay open.</TE>
<TE>   Towns will also remain open, so a family planning a weekend at
Idyllwild, for instance, can still access hotels, restaurants and
stores.</TE>
<TE>   Even a handful of paths and trails--those near heavily populated
areas and good roads--will still be accessible.</TE>
<TE>   The Woodland Trail in Big Bear, the Rock Camp Trail at Lake
Arrowhead and the famed Ernie Maxwell Trail in Idyllwild will remain
open, officials said. So will the Lytle Creek Shooting Area.</TE>
<TE>   But as for a long wilderness hike through the national forest,
"that's not going to happen," said Karen McKinley, a San Bernardino
National Forest trails coordinator. "It impacts a lot of things when
you do this," McKinley said. "It's pretty serious. There are so many
private [companies] and communities that depend upon the
recreationists economically. But you've got to weigh that with the
fire danger."</TE>
<TE>   Forestry officials don't expect to lift the restrictions until the
area gets about 2 inches of rain.</TE>
<TE>   That typically occurs in mid-November, they said, though it's
possible that the restrictions could remain in place until the end of
the year.</TE>
<TE>   Hunters will be particularly hard-hit by the closures. Bow-hunting
season is already underway in most regions, and the gun-hunting deer
season begins in mid-October in most areas.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at California Department of Fish and Game offices across
the region were already trying to provide upset hunters with
alternative spots, such as U.S. Bureau of Land Management land that
is outside the national forests, where they can go.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to assume that the Forest Service is doing what they are
doing for a reason," said Mike McBridge, senior enforcement officer
for Fish and Game's Eastern Sierra-Inland Deserts Region. "We are
living with the fact that it's their decision to make."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the Los Padres National Forest may be affected more
than any other area by the closures because officials there are
bracing for big crowds spilling over from closed areas to the south.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know how much of an increase in use to anticipate as a
result of these other closures," Good said. "And we just want people
to remember that we are in the middle of fire season here too."</TE>
<TE>   Already, Good said, campfires and barbecues have been outlawed
throughout the 1.76-million-acre Los Padres National Forest, as they
have at Southern California's other national forests.</TE>

<HD>W. Hollywood Attack Ruled No Hate Crime</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Three suspects in the beating of two gay men
will be charged with robbery, prosecutors say, angering community
leaders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN and KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors announced Thursday that no hate-crime charges will be
filed against three suspects accused of attacking two gay men last
month with a baseball bat, angering West Hollywood politicians, gay
rights activists and sheriff's deputies.</LD>
<LD>   There is no evidence that the early-morning Sept. 2 assault on
actor Treve Broudy and his friend, Edward Ulett, was a hate crime
because no anti-gay epithets were used, said the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   There was another attack on Sept. 22, when two people beat a
55-year-old gay man as they yelled anti-gay epithets. The victim in
that case has not been able to identify the assailants and no charges
have been filed, district attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said.
The suspects' possible involvement in the latest attack is still
under investigation, Deputy Sheriff Don Mueller said.</LD>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley said Thursday that it was not
unreasonable to think that hate crimes had occurred, but that after a
thorough review, his office determined that the motive of the recent
attacks in West Hollywood was robbery. But he said his office is
committed to prosecuting hate crimes and could add more charges if
additional evidence develops.</TE>
<TE>   "One hate crime in Los Angeles County is one too many, whether it
involves race, religion or sexual orientation," he said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   West Hollywood politicians and activists gathered at the Beverly
Hills courthouse Thursday to protest. West Hollywood City Councilman
Jeffrey Prang called the decision absurd. Mayor Pro Tem Steve Martin
said the city will ask the state attorney general's office to step in
and prosecute the case as a hate crime.</TE>
<TE>   "We are just a little bit incredulous," Martin said. "We are
expressing today our consternation that the district attorney is
taking this incredibly conservative stand. Here we are dealing with a
case that seems to be a hate crime on its face."</TE>
<TE>   If convicted of the current charges against them, the suspects
could face between six and 19 years in prison. If convicted of
separate hate-crime allegations, two years could be added to their
sentences.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department recommended to
prosecutors that they file the case as a hate crime, Mueller said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our entire community in West Hollywood, including the Sheriff's
Department, is extremely disappointed," Mueller said. "Based on our
interview with the suspects and the information that they admitted
to, we believe that there is evidence to go forward with a hate-crime
charge."</TE>
<TE>   He said investigators will continue to search for more evidence,
vowing, "We are not backing off."</TE>
<TE>   Gibbons said the evidence that Mueller cited, statements by a
suspect, cannot be used in court. Statements indicate that the
suspects wanted to "rob rich white people." Two of the men had
previously been convicted of robberies, the district attorney's
office said.</TE>
<TE>   "The suspects were on their way to rob people," Gibbons said. "We
don't have any proof they singled out Mr. Broudy or his companion
because they were gay. And therefore it would be wrong to charge
something we can't prove."</TE>
<TE>   Nathan Barankin, a spokesman for California Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer, said it would be unusual for his office to take the case. He
added that the office has yet to receive a formal complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "The attorney general does not routinely substitute his judgment
for the prosecutorial decision by the duly elected district
attorney," Barankin said.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office charged Larry Walker, 29, Vincent
Dotson, 18, and Torwin Sessions, 19, each with one count of attempted
robbery, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, and one count of
conspiracy to commit robbery. The three men, who were arrested
Tuesday night in connection with the attack, pleaded not guilty in
Superior Court Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   West Hollywood City Councilman John Duran, an attorney, said he is
frustrated by the decision because he believes the case was clearly a
crime against gays. He pointed out that the assault occurred within
100 yards of gay nightclubs and that the suspects used baseball bats
and pipes.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are not instruments that are used for an attempted
robbery," he said.</TE>
<TE>   West Hollywood City Manager Paul Arevalo said he spoke to Cooley
on the phone Thursday and told him he was disappointed with the
decision. Arevalo said he told Cooley that his prosecutors "were not
acting as they should in this case."</TE>
<TE>   Chanting "Recall Cooley" and carrying signs that asked, "How Can a
Beating Not be Hate?" about 300 people gathered at Santa Monica and
San Vicente boulevards Thursday night to protest the decision and
hear officials demand that Cooley reconsider.</TE>
<TE>   Among them was Assemblyman Paul Koretz (D-West Hollywood), who
called the filing "one of the biggest prosecutorial mistakes I can
remember."</TE>
<TE>   "The district attorney said he won't respond to political
pressure," Koretz said. "But political pressure must be kept on him
anyway. Hate-crime charges must not be ruled out at this point."</TE>
<TE>   Standing on the back of a pick-up truck and speaking with a
bullhorn, Deputy Lynda Castro received loud applause when she
delivered a message from Sheriff Lee Baca:</TE>
<TE>   "After conferring with the district attorney, I'm requesting the
charges be amended--contingent upon further investigation--to allow
the charges to come forward with the hate-crime enhancement."</TE>
<TE>   Roger Coggen, director of legal services at the Gay and Lesbian
Center in Los Angeles, said he was encouraged by Baca's involvement.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually, we're the ones pleading with law enforcement to
categorize certain attacks as hate crimes," he said. "When you have
the Sheriff's Department advocating it, you know there's more to the
case."</TE>
<TE>   The attack on Broudy and Ulett was the first in a series of three
assaults on men that inspired fear in West Hollywood, where nearly
one-third of the residents are gay. The victims had just embraced on
Cynthia Street when they were attacked with a baseball bat,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   That same morning, Christopher Roehm was attacked nearby,
authorities said. According to the criminal complaint filed Thursday,
the suspects went to West Hollywood in a stolen car to commit
robberies.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint alleges that Sessions got out of the car and hit
Broudy with the baseball bat. He is charged with inflicting great
bodily injury. Broudy is still hospitalized and may have suffered
brain damage in the attack, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Sessions is being held in County Jail on $215,000 bail. He could
face a 19-year prison term. Walker is on $185,000 bail and could
receive 16 years in prison. Both Sessions and Walker have prior
robbery convictions, prosecutors said. Dotson is being held on
$135,000 bail; he could be sentenced to six years.</TE>
<TE>   A preliminary hearing was scheduled for Nov. 4.</TE>

<LD>A father who allegedly abducted his year-old son from the child's
mother in Los Angeles on Thursday also may be holding her sister
against her will and might be headed to Mexico, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities issued a regionwide Amber alert as they searched for
Amadeo Medina, 37, who already was wanted on a domestic violence
warrant.</LD>
<LD>   Medina woke the child's mother, Debora Salizar, from a nap at her
home in the 1600 block of West 59th Street about 1:30 p.m. and said,
"Either you come with me or you're never going to see [Felipe]
again," Capt. Jim Miller said.</LD>
<TE>   A fight ensued, and when Salizar went outside, she saw her son and
her sister Naomi Salizar in the sister's Mercury Tracer. Debora
Salizar told police the child and his aunt had left earlier to go
shopping.</TE>
<TE>   Debora Salizar tried to pull Felipe out of the car, but Medina
drove away, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Police don't know if the aunt was restrained, Miller said, but she
"didn't make an effort to get out of the car."</TE>
<TE>   Police said the baby's aunt was being considered a victim.</TE>
<TE>   Medina claimed to have a gun, although none was seen, Police Lt.
Horace Frank said.</TE>
<TE>   According to a witness, Medina left the house and made a U-turn,
stopping again at the Salizar house and calling to Debora Salizar,
"This is your last chance. Are you coming or not?"</TE>
<TE>   A domestic dispute call to the same address four months ago led to
the felony warrant for Medina, who fled to Mexicali, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   The green Mercury Tracer is a four-door model, with the California
license plate number 3KDE021, Frank said.</TE>
<TE>   Medina also drives a 1998 GMC pickup with California plates
reading 5S32244.</TE>
<TE>   The California Highway Patrol issued a bulletin, saying Medina
might be headed for the Mexican border.</TE>
<TE>   The child was wearing a green, striped jumpsuit and brown leather
shoes, according to the CHP.</TE>

<HD>Laguna Ordered to Fix Its Sewers</HD>
<DH>Environment: The EPA wants steps taken to halt spills that
have polluted beaches, but also praises the city for what it's
already done.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday ordered Laguna
Beach to take immediate steps to halt sewage spills that have
polluted local beaches. The city has one of the worst records in
California, the agency said.</LD>
<LD>   But officials of the federal agency described the order as a
formality, making a point of praising the city for measures it has
already taken, and the millions of dollars it already has spent, to
reduce sewage spills.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes less than two months after the EPA awarded the city
$873,000 to help meet the no-spill mandate of the federal Clean Water
Act.</LD>
<TE>   "City officials are aware of the problem and have already been
taking steps to solve it," EPA regional administrator Wayne Nastri
said in a written statement. "They have made a bold commitment to
ending sewage discharges, and we applaud them for all they've done
and continue to do. Our action simply commits the city to carry out
their planned sewer system improvements."</TE>
<TE>   EPA spokesman Mark Merchant added, "This is just a formal step.
We're not fining them, we're not doing anything special. This just
puts down on paper in the form of an agreement what Laguna already
told us they're going to do."</TE>
<TE>   The agency also on Thursday ordered the city of Carpinteria to
stop spills. These are the first orders of their kind in the region,
though the agency is investigating another half-dozen California
cities.</TE>
<TE>   Portions of Laguna Beach's crumbling 95-mile network of pipes and
other infrastructure date to the 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   Between July 1, 1997, and June 30, the city reported 64 sewage
spills, nearly a third of which flowed into local waterways and
closed picturesque beaches. The order requires the city to complete a
sewage spill-reduction action plan by March. The plan must include a
sewer-system cleaning and root-control program; a pipe inspection and
assessment; a repair and replacement schedule; and a pump-station and
force-main maintenance, repair and upgrade plan.</TE>
<TE>   City leaders welcomed the news.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the EPA is doing its job by issuing the order," said
Mayor Wayne Baglin. "And I'm very pleased that it reflects much of
the proactive actions the city has taken on during just the last
couple years."</TE>
<TE>   The order notes that the city increased sewer fees, adopted an
$18.9-million sewer plan and completed 45 high-priority repairs.</TE>
<TE>   "This shows that the City Council was acting in a responsible
manner in spending the millions of dollars it has been spending,"
Baglin said.</TE>
<TE>   City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said he plans to use the order to
bolster the city's request for $12 million in state loans and $1
million in additional federal grant money.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Twice now in a career that began in 1975, extraordinary circumstances
have forced me to momentarily cast humility aside and do a little
gloating.</LD>
<LD>   The first instance involved an honor that is among the highest
achievements in the field of journalism. It happened in Philadelphia,
where an Italian deli named its meatball sandwich after me.</LD>
<LD>   (The restaurant went out of business soon afterward, but I didn't
take it personally).</LD>
<TE>   The second honor came early this week, and I'm still in the
clouds.</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street Journal called me an idiot for a column in which I
questioned the rush to war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   It's too close to call, but I think this may top the meatball
sandwich.</TE>
<TE>   Don't get me wrong. The Journal's news report is among the finest
in the nation. On its best days, it even comes close to that of the
Los Angeles Times.</TE>
<TE>   But the editorial page has always been in the middle of a
three-way affair. On one side of the bed is big business, and on the
other side is Attila the Hun.</TE>
<TE>   To be precise, the swipe at me came in OpinionJournal, an online
version of the newspaper's editorial page. I'm having it framed for
the headline alone:</TE>
<TE>   "Stupidity Watch."</TE>
<TE>   The writer gave me a good spanking for my Sunday column, saying I
don't have a clue how to gauge public opinion. I had said the polls
suggesting that 70% of the country supports a war must be wrong
because 75% of my readers were against.</TE>
<TE>   "Lopez apparently doesn't know what a 'representative sample' is.
It's unlikely that readers of his column represent a cross-section of
Americans."</TE>
<TE>   This guy apparently doesn't know what a rhetorical argument is.
This war could go wrong in 600 ways President Bush hasn't discussed
with the American public, so, yes, I threw my skewed readership at
the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on the e-mail we receive," the Journal scribe prattled,
"we'd say 95% of readers of this column support a war in Iraq, and of
those who don't, perhaps half are either openly anti-Semitic or just
plain nuts. But of course our readers are a self-selected group too."</TE>
<TE>   I don't know if that number is an exaggeration. But if 95% of the
readers of a Journal column support a war, it's got to be a bad idea.</TE>
<TE>   The writer also said my "stupid argument doesn't even have the
virtue of originality," because the New York Times' Thomas Friedman
"made essentially the same argument two weeks ago."</TE>
<TE>   I didn't see Friedman's column, but the comparison is almost as
flattering as being called a nitwit by one of the president's water
boys at the Journal.</TE>
<TE>   But I digress from the far more substantive point, just as the
Journal did. For those who missed the column at issue, my brief
reference to reader response was little more than a set-up for an
interview with USC professor Richard Dekmejian. He's an authority on
terrorism, Middle East politics and the psyche of Iraq's Saddam
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   I'd heard too many people in Washington bark about taking out
Hussein as if it would be as simple as removing a wart.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed to me we ought to hear a scholar explain how quickly a
war could go badly and unleash more acts of terrorism on American
soil.</TE>
<TE>   At this juncture, I'd like to share the response to that column
with my new friends at the Journal, admitting upfront that it is not
a "representative sample."</TE>
<TE>   A lot of readers are ready for war, and a good number of them--I'm
guessing they must have Journal subscriptions--called me a coward or
an ignoramus. Nothing new there. I often get as many jeers as cheers.</TE>
<TE>   But more readers are worked up about this subject than anything
I've written since the Catholic Church served up daily column fodder.
And those who want the president to make a stronger case for war come
in all flavors.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve, I am a registered Republican who has voted my party at the
national level in virtually every election since 1976 ... [and] I've
supported both Bush presidencies," wrote Dom Brunone. The Texan, who
travels through Europe and the Middle East on business, keeps hearing
dumbfounded foreigners question "the sanity and good intention" of
the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "Truth is, I do too. 'Bullies' is the best word for how others
perceive America. This administration may have its reasons for going
into Iraq, but it sure hasn't made its case with me or the vast
majority of the free world, including the American people."</TE>
<TE>   Brunone said he'd like the administration to produce hard evidence
of an arms buildup by Hussein before launching a preemptive strike.
I'd just like to hear how Iraq represents a greater danger than, say,
Iran, or the terrorists who are gunning for us as we speak.</TE>
<TE>   "How can we stop this madness by our junior president before it's
too late?" Brunone asked.</TE>
<TE>   USC's Dekmejian, who counts Hussein as a menace, doesn't argue
against war under all circumstances. He argues against a sprint to
war without a full consideration of the consequences, and although
one professor called on the phone is not a "representative sample,"
he doesn't sound half nuts to me.</TE>
<TE>   Keep up the demand for weapons inspections and press on with
weapons-detection intelligence, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Turn up the heat on economic sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   Unite the international community in these causes rather than
alienating it.</TE>
<TE>   And understand that no matter how many lives are lost and how many
billions of dollars spent in a war, "We may not be able to reengineer
a new Middle East that is better than the present one."</TE>

<HD>4 Women Held in Dinner Club Pyramid Scheme</HD>
<DH>Crime: The upscale suburban scam ensnared thousands, D.A.
says. Defense attorney says it was 'a harmless parlor game.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Marching to jail wearing handcuffs and brave smiles, the four were a
most unusual cast of criminal suspects: career women and soccer moms,
PTA volunteers and den mothers.</LD>
<LD>   One is a college professor. Another co-owns a suburban Montessori
school. All live in stylish neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   Their alleged crime: promoting a dinner club that was actually an
upscale pyramid scheme, investigators say. It snared up to 10,000
eager participants and helped $12 million change hands.</LD>
<TE>   They called it "Women Helping Women." The sales pitch--delivered
over the past two years at intoxicating girls-night-out bashes and
clubby dinner parties--revolved around female empowerment, putting
cash into the pockets of deserving women to do good.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, a small number of "greedy women" profited from countless
gullible participants, said Jan Scully, Sacramento County district
attorney. " 'Women Fooling Women' more aptly characterizes this
illegal scheme," she said.</TE>
<TE>   None of those arrested figured they were doing anything wrong,
their defense attorney insisted. They considered it an enticing
social event with a pot of gold at the end, an experience not much
different from gambling in an office football pool.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the kinds of women you'd expect around a Thanksgiving
dinner table, the backbone of America," said Bill Portanova, a
Sacramento defense attorney. "They're intelligent, educated women who
thought they were engaged in a harmless parlor game."</TE>
<TE>   If so, the stakes were steep. To buy in, a participant put up
$5,000 and then recruited eight other players. As those players put
up money and recruited still others, the participant would move
gradually closer to an ultimate payoff of $40,000 promised each
player at a culminating "birthday" bash. The scheme was organized
around a dinner theme: Participants moved up from "appetizer" status,
to "soup and salad" class, then "entree" and finally "dessert" level.</TE>
<TE>   None of the women arrested has had any prior brush with the law,
Portanova said, and all declined to comment. They are Cheryl Bean,
54, a former human resources officer at Pacific Bell; Anne King, 47,
co-owner of a Montessori school; Pamela Garibaldi, 57, a part-time
college English professor; and Cathy Lovely, 49, a homemaker.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say each of the suspects reaped more than $100,000 in
profits by manipulating the game so they repeatedly cashed out at the
top level. Portanova said the four deny that anyone cheated.</TE>
<TE>   Each posted $5,000 bail and was released within hours of her
arrest Wednesday. They were booked on suspicion of felony conspiracy
to cheat and defraud and on violations of securities laws and the
California "endless chain" statute. If convicted, each could face
three years in prison and fines of up to $10,000 per offense.</TE>
<TE>   This week's arrests may be just the start. Investigators say they
expect to snag several dozen more participants in the case, an
offshoot of a Ponzi scheme that has been moving through North America
since the late 1990s. A similar pyramid scheme was crushed two years
ago in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Participants are spread up and down the Central Valley and into
the Sierra foothills. So far, a dozen search warrants have been
issued for homes in some of the region's priciest neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. James Lewis, a Sacramento sheriff's spokesman, said all the
top players have resolutely maintained that they've done nothing
wrong. They've suggested, instead, that the arrests are "just another
case of men trying to put the thumb on women and keep them down,"
Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   "They've wrapped themselves in a shroud of supporting women's
causes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In part, their feelings of invulnerability were bolstered because
a deputy district attorney in neighboring El Dorado County attended
several dinner parties and suggested that the scheme was legal, Lewis
said. "They were given some very bad advice."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis said the four women also committed a "fraud within a fraud,"
cheating other participants by manipulating the game to cut in line
or create phony participants.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators say Bean, one of the biggest boosters of the scheme,
inserted her husband in the game under the name "Paulette."</TE>
<TE>   Garibaldi, investigators allege, sponsored her college students as
participants, then was repaid when the pupils cashed out by reaching
the top of the ladder.</TE>

<LD>A man accused in a 10-week rape and robbery spree in Santa Ana agreed
Thursday to allow a judge to decide his fate rather than a jury.</LD>
<LD>   Edward Alberto Guzman, 24, will stand trial Monday on 39 rape,
sodomy, kidnapping and robbery counts. Guzman faces eight life terms,
plus 300 years, if convicted on all counts, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ed
Flores said.</LD>
<LD>   He said the trial would have taken about a month if heard by a
jury, but will last about two weeks before a judge.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender Hector Chaparro wouldn't say why his client
opted for a court trial.</TE>
<TE>   Guzman was held for a string of attacks that police said began
about June 1, 2000.</TE>

<HD>'The Dark Side of Ojai'</HD>
<DH>Community: Forum on over-policing turns into a rap session
on what's wrong with the artists' enclave. Turns out, it's mostly too
much traffic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GAIL DAVIS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The meeting was supposed to be about Ojai residents' concerns about
"over-policing" of this small town known as much for its activists as
for its artists.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the public forum held under the oaks at the Ojai House on
Wednesday night turned into more of a community soul cleansing,
touching on everything from traffic congestion to insensitive
treatment by police.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the dark side of Ojai," said moderator Sarra Jubinville,
65, an artist and longtime resident.</LD>
<TE>   About 50 people turned out for the meeting, prompted by
Jubinville's concerns that local police have become overly aggressive
in handing out traffic tickets and pedestrian citations.</TE>
<TE>   Jubinville said her 32-year-old son was stopped on three occasions
and treated like "a hard-core criminal" for riding his bike at night.
She has collected about 350 signatures on petitions, demanding that
the City Council establish a citizens' police oversight committee.</TE>
<TE>   But Sheriff's Capt. Gary Pentis, who functions as Ojai's police
chief, questioned the need for such a committee. He told the audience
that residents can take their complaints directly to the City Council
and the Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Ojai City Councilwoman Rae Hanstad told the group she would be
happy to investigate any complaints. She pointed out, however, that
she has received only one complaint in her two years on the council.</TE>
<TE>   Many concerns voiced at the meeting centered on stepped-up traffic
enforcement and increasing congestion in the town of 7,800. During
the first half of the year, deputies more than doubled the number of
motor vehicle and pedestrian citations they handed out, jumping from
325 to 677.</TE>
<TE>   Pentis said this was part of a deliberate effort by his officers
to slow traffic, making local roadways safer, rather than an attempt
to simply generate more revenue through fines, as some have charged.</TE>
<TE>   Pentis presented a report to the City Council last week, citing
Ojai's dismal record of traffic-related injuries. Among 88
similar-sized cities across California, Ojai ranks fifth in
traffic-related injuries, sixth in pedestrian accidents involving
seniors and eighth for speed-related injuries, he said.</TE>
<TE>   During Wednesday's forum, some participants described themselves
as being among Ojai's "fringe" crowd and said deputies often single
them out for being different.</TE>
<TE>   Pentis acknowledged that deputies could work harder on improving
relations with all residents and showing a little more sensitivity,
especially in a small community like Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   "You're working in a fishbowl," the officer said. "Perception is
reality."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone came to complain. Some praised deputies for their
quick response times. Schoolteacher Scott Jaffe, 31, said half a
dozen squad cars were dispatched to his house in May when a youth
tried to hold him up with an air pistol that resembled a real gun.</TE>
<TE>   Resident Bob Daddi, an insurance agent, said his chief concern is
the increasing traffic. He said the city's intersections are a mess
and he would like to see flashing lights installed at the busy corner
of Ojai Avenue and Montgomery Street, where 26 accidents occurred in
the first six months of this year.</TE>
<TE>   Retirees Tom and Kathy Jamison, who live in the unincorporated
Mira Monte area, said they came to the forum out of curiosity, and
were undecided on whether Ojai is over-policed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a little bit of truth on both sides," Tom Jamison
said.</TE>

Thursday's L.A. Times, I thought at first that it referred to the
hiring of ex-Gotham Police Commissioner William Bratton to head the
LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   But, of course, it referred to the Angels' departure from Yankee
Stadium with a playoff win. By coincidence, actor Kurt Russell, who
starred in the movie "Escape From New York," was once a promising
infielder in the Angels organization before an injury ended his
career.</TE>
<TE>   Russell also made a sequel, "Escape From L.A." which is what the
Angels did when they moved south down the Santa Ana Freeway to
Anaheim after the 1964 season.</TE>
<TE>   Cheap hex? Until the Angels' win over the Yankees on Wednesday,
Carol Custer wondered if the 99 Cents Only chain had jinxed the
Anaheimers against winning any post-season games.</TE>
<TE>   Prior to the playoffs, the chain ran an ad congratulating the
Angels on winning 99 games during the regular season. But the ad went
on to say, somewhat ominously: "Remember, Nothing Over 99 Ever."</TE>
<TE>   No fashion risks: It was quite a scene at Edison Field when
tickets for the Angels' home playoff games went on sale Thursday. A
colleague of mine spotted groups of young men flashing big wads of
cash as they bought the tickets. The limit was eight per individual,
but getting around that rule was no problem. Some of the youths
stripped off their outer shirts and caps and got back in different
lines to buy more. And you wonder how ticket agencies and scalpers
obtain those outrageously priced tickets.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani was a guest on the
Angels' radio broadcast on KLAC-AM (570) and revealed that as a youth
his baseball model was Yogi Berra.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani admitted that he not only didn't have the baseball skills
of Berra, he also wouldn't want to run against him for political
office.</TE>
<TE>   Explained Giuliani: "Could you imagine debating him?"</TE>

<HD>D.A.'s Environmental Crime Unit Thinks Big</HD>
<DH>Oil companies and the city of Huntington Beach are among
those brought to heel by aggressive prosecutors from the Orange
County office.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County is known for its stunning 42-mile coastline, dotted by
rocky coves, delicate tide pools and stretches of sandy beach. In
recent years, the county has also become recognized in legal circles
for aggressively prosecuting those who harm those picturesque shores
and other natural resources.</LD>
<LD>   The district attorney's environmental crimes unit has taken on an
array of powerful targets, from multinational corporations that
threaten local drinking water supplies to the city of Huntington
Beach, which pleaded guilty to pollution charges.</LD>
<LD>   "Orange County has always had an outstanding reputation for having
a strong environmental unit," said Gale Filter, environmental project
director with the California District Attorneys Assn. in Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   Bruce Klafter, immediate past chairman of the state bar's
environmental law section and an advisor to the section, agrees.
"They certainly seem to be busier and doing higher-profile cases than
many of the other units."</TE>
<TE>   In most parts of the United States, environmental prosecution is
handled at the state level. But in California, most large cities and
counties handle such crimes within their borders.</TE>
<TE>   The state does have roving prosecutors doing the work in rural
areas that can't afford to do it themselves. That state program was
modeled on environmental crimes units launched in several counties
across the state, including Orange County, said Filter, who helped
develop the state program.</TE>
<TE>   Most large cities and counties have environmental crimes units. In
the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, four lawyers take
on oil spills, illegal hazardous waste transportation, fraudulent
automobile smog checks and other crimes, said Deputy Dist. Atty.
Richard Sullivan.</TE>
<TE>   "This unit's heyday was probably in the late '80s, when we may
have had as many as 10 D.A.s," he said. "Over the years, resources
have been taken away."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Orange County Assistant Dist. Atty. Joe D'Agostino
said, the amount of resources allocated for his county's unit has
more than tripled since Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas took office in
January 1999. Staffed with 10 attorneys, four investigators, two
paralegals and a clerical staff, the Orange County environmental SWAT
team is handling about 100 cases. About 80% are criminal
prosecutions; the remainder are headed to civil court.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the model," D'Agostino said of the unit he heads. "I can
proudly babble on about it. It is considered one of the best in the
country."</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said prosecuting environmental crimes is as important
as other types of criminal prosecution--and an effective deterrent.</TE>
<TE>   He said that he decided to make it a priority when he realized the
office could have a significant effect on Orange County's
environmental future.</TE>
<TE>   "I was becoming aware of some of the problems that we have with
some of the various violations, and I didn't want to be sitting
around 10 or 15 years from now thinking 'We could still have a real
environment if the D.A. would have prosecuted some of these
violations,' " he said. "It's important to stay on top of things so
that our environment doesn't get reduced in terms of health and
safety."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Evans, a former top administrator for Rackauckas who has
become a major critic, said he strongly disagrees with leadership
changes the district attorney has instituted in the division.</TE>
<TE>   But "the county is served well," said Evans, executive director of
the Surfrider Foundation in San Clemente. "There has been a history
of hard-charging, dedicated career prosecutors in that unit."</TE>
<TE>   One high-profile case involves leaking storage tanks beneath 330
gas stations that allowed a possible carcinogen to taint groundwater.
Prosecutors are seeking millions of dollars in civil penalties from
Atlantic Richfield Co., BP Amoco Corp., Thrifty Oil Co., Shell Oil
Co., ARCO Chemical Co. and Lyondell Chemical Co.</TE>
<TE>   The case, scheduled to go to trial in January, is among the
biggest MTBE contamination suits in the nation and is being closely
watched by other communities affected by the gasoline additive.</TE>
<TE>   "That has become their bailiwick," Filter said. "That's their
focus because of the inherent danger that exists with underground
storage tanks in Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday the office filed 17 felony pollution charges against a
Buena Park chrome-wheel manufacturing company, its owner and three
employees. A two-year investigation led to allegations that the men
dumped heavy metals, corrosive acid and other hazardous waste into
sewer and storm-drain systems. They face up to 11 1/2 years in state
prison and $1 million in fines if convicted of all charges.</TE>
<TE>   Another noteworthy case the unit is handling involves a former
Huntington Beach city councilman charged with polluting 14 acres of
the Bolsa Chica wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   John Thomas, an oil well rig owner who served on the council from
1978 to 1986 and ran on an environmental platform in an unsuccessful
bid for the county Board of Supervisors, is accused of dumping 38,000
cubic yards of wood chips and dirt and an unspecified amount of oil
there. A judge is scheduled to decide next week whether the matter
will go to trial.</TE>
<TE>   The office made headlines last year when a lengthy investigation
led to charges against Huntington Beach for allowing millions of
gallons of raw sewage to leak from aging underground pipes.</TE>
<TE>   In a highly unusual admission of criminal culpability, the city
pleaded guilty to three misdemeanors and was placed on probation for
five years.</TE>
<TE>   Cases such as these have ensured that within the Orange County
district attorney's office, the unit is viewed as a prestigious
station. In recent years, two judges--one elected and one
appointed--have come from the unit.</TE>
<TE>   D'Agostino said: "The reason people are here is because they've
asked to work here. We have a couple of people--this was their dream
job.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big deal in Orange County. We have a sophisticated,
educated populace," D'Agostino said. "It's funny: We're considered a
conservative Republican county, [but] we're very protective of the
environment."</TE>

<HD>Bruce Paltrow, 58; Directed Series 'White Shadow,' 'St.
Elsewhere'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bruce Paltrow, the producer-director behind the groundbreaking
television shows "St. Elsewhere" and "The White Shadow" as well as
the father of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, died Wednesday of pneumonia
while traveling in Rome, a spokesman for the family said. He was 58.</LD>
<LD>   Paltrow, who had been married more than 30 years to actress Blythe
Danner, was on the trip to Italy to celebrate his daughter's 30th
birthday. He had been diagnosed with throat cancer and had
experienced a recurrence of the disease.</LD>
<LD>   Although perhaps most famous recently because of his daughter (his
son, Jake, is also a director), Paltrow was associated with two
seminal TV series as well as several less successful projects, among
them the karaoke-themed movie "Duets," which starred Gwyneth and was
released in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   One of his two major successes, "The White Shadow," which aired on
CBS from 1978 to 1981, featured Ken Howard as a former professional
basketball player who becomes the coach at a tough inner-city high
school. The program dealt realistically with social and racial
matters.</TE>
<TE>   "He was truly funny, in any situation," Howard said Thursday. He
also co-starred with Danner in a series version of "Adam's Rib"
before "White Shadow." "When it was just guys, he was even
funnier.... And he was very much a straight shooter."</TE>
<TE>   Paltrow directed the poorly received film comedy "A Little Sex" in
1982 before turning his attention to producing the medical drama "St.
Elsewhere," which premiered on NBC that year.</TE>
<TE>   In a departure from traditional TV medical shows like "Ben Casey"
and "Dr. Kildare," "St. Elsewhere" focused on an eclectic group of
flawed characters within St. Eligius, a run-down Boston hospital. The
series, whose co-stars included Denzel Washington, dealt with thorny
topics from rape to AIDS and occasionally veered into broad
comedy--including a memorable episode in which a male mental patient
was convinced that he was Mary Richards, the character from "The Mary
Tyler Moore Show."</TE>
<TE>   David Bushman, a curator at the Museum of Television and Radio in
New York, credited the series with "paying no attention to the
conventions of the genre" and being one of the programs in the 1980s
that helped excite baby boomers about television.</TE>
<TE>   "In the medical shows that had come before, the doctors themselves
were demigods," he said, adding on a personal level that Paltrow was
"the most unassuming, most unpretentious guy I've ever met."</TE>
<TE>   Paltrow knew "St. Elsewhere" was a gamble. In an interview a few
months before the premiere, he said, "If we're going to fail, we're
going to fail spectacularly. We're not trying to make a nice, polite
show. Who needs another one of those?"</TE>
<TE>   Initial ratings were disappointing, but after considerable
hand-wringing, NBC decided to renew the series for a second year. At
the time, Brandon Tartikoff, then president of NBC Entertainment,
called the first season's final episode "the finest hour I'd seen on
television. I said to my wife that it was tragic such a fine show
wasn't being watched. I wondered what I was doing in this business if
it wasn't to do that kind of television."</TE>
<TE>   The program ultimately survived six seasons, concluding with a
controversial episode suggesting the entire story had been dreamed in
the mind of an autistic child--an hour that Paltrow directed.</TE>
<TE>   After "St. Elsewhere," Paltrow created several series but couldn't
replicate the show's creative cachet or even its modest commercial
popularity. Subsequent efforts included "Tattingers," an NBC series
that co-starred Danner, and "Home Fires," a 1992 comedy that began
each week with its central family in therapy. The latter ran only six
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Bruce Paltrow taught me everything I know about television,"
writer-producer Tom Fontana, who worked with him on "St. Elsewhere"
and "Homicide: Life on the Street," said in a statement. "He loved
good writing, fine wines, his friends and his family."</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Paltrow directed episodes of the HBO series "Mind
of the Married Man." The show's star and creator, Mike Binder, talked
of Paltrow's humanity and willingness to champion the work of others.</TE>
<TE>   "He got more people jobs and more people work and more people
their first script and directing job, from 'The White Shadow' to 'St.
Elsewhere,' " Binder said. "This guy touched so many people in this
business. He was just a giver."</TE>
<TE>   Several actors went on to become successful television directors
after beginning on episodes of their respective series. "The White
Shadow's" Thomas Carter directed "Miami Vice" and the 2001 hit "Save
the Last Dance," and "St. Elsewhere's" Eric Laneuville has directed
episodes of "NYPD Blue" and "ER." Timothy Van Patten, another "White
Shadow" cast member, has also directed episodes of HBO's "The
Sopranos."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., into a family of rabbis that dates back to
17th century Russia, Paltrow graduated from New Orleans' Tulane
University in the mid-1960s and a few years later produced the
off-Broadway play "Someone's Coming Hungry." He broke into television
in 1973, writing and producing the ABC movie "Shirts/Skins."</TE>
<TE>   Paltrow and Danner--who currently stars in the CBS medical series
"Presidio Med"--met when Paltrow began teasing her about the
conservative outfit she had worn to an audition. They married in
1970, and Gwyneth was born two years later. With Jake's birth in
1975, the couple balanced their careers by sharing responsibility for
the children, which included taking them onto movie and TV sets.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, they appeared on CBS' "Sunday Morning" program to
discuss how they managed to sustain a Hollywood marriage.</TE>
<TE>   When asked their secret, Paltrow said, "I always say jokingly ...
we both didn't want to get divorced at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   On a more serious note, Danner called him "the most honest man
I've ever met in my life. I mean, he can be rough, but you always
know that you're getting the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Paltrow took enormous pride in his daughter's accomplishments, and
Gwyneth thanked her parents effusively after winning a best actress
Oscar for the 1998 movie "Shakespeare in Love."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a weeper," Paltrow said in an interview the following year.
"When I see her, I weep.... So I had to tell myself not to go to
pieces, because otherwise there would be the camera and every time
they show the Academy Award highlights, there would be her speech and
then me, this glob. I determined to hold it together. And I did.
Until we got outside."</TE>
<TE>   Paltrow's body will be flown to New York for funeral services, his
agent Lee Gabler said Thursday. A memorial service in Los Angeles
will be held at a later date.</TE>

<HD>Officers Saluted for Outreach Efforts</HD>
<DH>Law enforcement: The Human Relations Commission honors
programs that build ties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seven police officers and law enforcement programs--including an
entire police department--were recognized by the Orange County Human
Relations Commission on Thursday for community outreach.</LD>
<LD>   A special award was given to Sheriff-Coroner Michael S. Carona and
the Sheriff's Department for work on the Samantha Runnion case. The
5-year-old was kidnapped outside her Stanton home and later killed.
Deputies arrested Alejandro Avila, 27, who has been charged with the
crimes. Avila has pleaded not guilty to kidnapping, sexually
assaulting and killing Samantha.</LD>
<LD>   The Garden Grove Police Department was honored because its leaders
made community policing part of its strategy.</LD>
<TE>   "All members of the department, civilian and sworn, were
encouraged to embody this philosophy as they undertook their daily
assignments," said Susan Reese, commission president, at an awards
breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove encouraged community policing among its 165 officers
but didn't stop there. "It included every dispatcher, records clerk
and officer in the entire department," said Lt. Paul Prince.</TE>
<TE>   Patrol officers were assigned a daily beat and told to work with
residents and business owners to solve problems</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, new programs emerged to encourage involvement by
residents, including a chief's forum, Korean outreach, Vietnamese
outreach and a neighborhood improvement team.</TE>
<TE>   Awards also were given to officers in Cypress, La Habra,
Placentia, Santa Ana and the Orange County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Cypress police were recognized for a team that lets officers
notify schools during emergencies. In La Habra, school violence was
targeted so students could attend after-school events
safely.Placentia's community service officer, Nilda Berndt, was
recognized for starting a student valet program. To help reduce car
accidents and improve traffic flow, fifth-grade students act as
valets, opening car doors and assisting students with backpacks.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Officer Mauricio Estrada was recognized for his role in
reducing burglaries at a building complex. Estrada held meetings and
sought the cooperation of residents and business owners. He also
organized "Kids Days" to reward local youths, and started
neighborhood cleanup days.</TE>
<TE>   In San Clemente, sheriff's officials recognized they had a problem
with local gangs and children afraid to travel to other cities for
fear of gang activity. They developed "Kids Safe Day USA," which
provides a safe environment for a youth conference for children from
Dana Point, San Juan Capistrano and San Clemente.</TE>

<LD>As the quest to break up Los Angeles nears a long-sought vote, the
secession movement's leaders are counting on support from a familiar
group that stunned the establishment 24 years ago: middle-class San
Fernando Valley residents whose alienation and resentment carried the
property-tax revolt of Proposition 13 to victory.</LD>
<LD>   The Valley secession campaign is taking several pages from the
Proposition 13 playbook, from populist fund-raising methods to a
reliance on homeowner groups for grass-roots organizing. That is no
surprise, because Proposition 13 had its start in the Valley, and
many of its early backers are now stumping for secession.</LD>
<LD>   Breakup advocates say they expect to duplicate the tax rebellion's
strong finish in the coming weeks, as they take their message of
smaller, more responsive government beyond their largely conservative
core of supporters, most of whom live in the Valley.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, the parallels between secession and Proposition 13
continue to give backers of Valley and Hollywood cityhood hope that
they will pull off a victory on Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 13 confronted strong opposition from many of the
state's political elites, and yet it won by a huge margin on election
day.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists have struggled to ignite a Proposition 13-style
"prairie fire," as then-Gov. Ronald Reagan described the effort, in a
campaign lagging in the polls, in fund-raising and in volunteers,
among other problems.</TE>
<TE>   The movement's appeal to the business community also is less
direct than in the case of Proposition 13, which businesses supported
with contributions because many were big property owners with money
at stake.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the secession campaign succeeds in capturing Proposition
13's spirit during the next few weeks will, some say, come down to
the payoff to voters that secessionists can realistically predict.</TE>
<TE>   By promising to end a decade of rapid increases in property taxes,
vowing to roll back rates and limit future hikes, Proposition 13
guaranteed property owners cash in the bank. It offered immediate
relief in a climate of crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Secession supporters argue a similar but less tangible case in the
current campaign. They say smaller cities will deliver better, more
efficient services, and therefore, breaking up Los Angeles will
ultimately be a money-saver.</TE>
<TE>   But the future of new Valley and Hollywood cities is filled with
unknowns, such as whether taxes will rise or fall or whether
political novices will be able to set up and run--in the Valley's
case--the nation's sixth-largest city. The appeal of breaking up Los
Angeles is based on a mostly intangible frustration with city
government.</TE>
<TE>   "Secession needs an issue--something the government has really
messed up on, something people could say they were really mad about,"
said John Matsusaka, a USC political scientist who has studied
Proposition 13.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Close, the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. president who
helped spearhead Proposition 13 and a leader in the secession
campaign, says people are angry. Voters will flock to support
secession because city services are poor, the bureaucracy is remote
and the Valley pays $127 million more per year in fees and taxes than
it receives in services, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Prop. 13 was all about making government better, making it
cheaper, smaller," said Close, who was 32 when Howard Jarvis, the
populist political gadfly who founded the tax-revolt movement, showed
up at a meeting of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. to push his
plans.</TE>
<TE>   "All those arguments that you hear reverberate in the independence
debate today had similar tones in the Prop. 13 debate almost 25 years
ago," Close said.</TE>
<TE>   Beating the Opposition</TE>
<TE>   Close and others say Proposition 13 overcame many of the same
obstacles standing in the way of secession, including opposition by
most politicians and business leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, state and local elected officials massed behind
Proposition 8, an alternative that would have resulted in smaller tax
cuts. Today, Mayor James K. Hahn and the City Council, in their fight
against secession, have assembled a broad coalition of business
organizations, labor unions, rent-control activists, and civil rights
and religious groups.</TE>
<TE>   The secessionists say that like Jarvis and Proposition 13 coauthor
Paul Gann, they can beat the establishment. They are relying on
precinct walkers, carefully targeted mailers and coffee klatches--a
close-to-the-ground campaign to mine voters' unhappiness with
government in and outside the Valley and Hollywood. To pass, each
secession measure must get a majority vote in both the breakaway
region and Los Angeles as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   "The level of upset about the way City Hall has managed the city's
business does exist throughout Los Angeles," secession strategist
Frank Schubert said. "Our job is to try to tap into that."</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Zasloff, who teaches law at UCLA and has studied the tax
revolt, said the parallels between secession and Proposition 13 are
strong.</TE>
<TE>   "The core sentiment of a lot of the supporters of Valley secession
and the core sentiment of a lot of the Proposition 13 supporters was
the same--a deep mistrust of government, a sense that government is
very unresponsive, that they are not getting their money's worth,"
Zasloff said.</TE>
<TE>   A number of Proposition 13 veterans are working for secession. Bob
Scott, who serves as the Valley cityhood movement's demographer and
planner, still has the homemade political buttons made by Proposition
13 advocates.</TE>
<TE>   Former Assemblywoman Paula Boland, a Proposition 13 activist in
the West Valley, helped draft the law that made secession possible.
She is running for a seat on the Valley city council that would be
created if the measure passes.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 13 volunteers plotted strategy in a conference room of
auto dealer Bert Boeckmann's Galpin Motors in North Hills, now the
secessionists' unofficial headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Borrowing From Jarvis</TE>
<TE>   The Proposition 13 links to the Hollywood campaign are fewer,
though its leader, nightclub owner Gene La Pietra, said Jarvis, who
died in 1986, is an inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   "We watch his strategy very carefully," La Pietra said. "I've
watched the old news clips. He had very little money, but he was a
personality. He got attention. He made excellent use of the press. He
was fun to look at. He was fun to listen to. He made the campaign
show biz, and I have learned from that."</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra has borrowed the Jarvis style of staging campaign
events: "He always had kids. Always balloons. Always something
happening. Hot dog cookouts."</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra said the homespun, festive feel of the Proposition 13
campaign made people comfortable--something he's trying to do in
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "People didn't really understand Proposition 13, how it worked,"
he said. "It was as convoluted as secession is. But they knew Howard
Jarvis. They knew he was fighting for the little guy."</TE>
<TE>   The Valley campaign, La Pietra said, isn't consulting the history
books as closely. "There's no show biz, no one leader to focus on,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Valley secessionists, however, say they are cribbing from Jarvis'
fund-raising tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Just four weeks before the 1978 election, the Jarvis camp sent
letters to property owners throughout the state, detailing how much
money homeowners would save under Proposition 13. Within days, about
$1 million had come in, nearly all of it in checks for $25 or less,
said political strategist Stu Mollrich, who worked on the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Near the end, the tax revolt had $1.1 million to their opponents'
$1 million. The Proposition 13 campaign used the money for a late
advertising blitz, which Mollrich said put the initiative over the
top. Its radio ads featured Reagan, and its television spots showed
Jarvis with Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman. "The other
side never saw it coming," Mollrich said.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley cityhood campaign is sending mailers tailored to
neighborhood constituencies in hopes of reaping a similar windfall.</TE>
<TE>   Voters in Granada Hills will receive a letter highlighting
concerns over the nearby Sunshine Canyon Landfill. Those in Sherman
Oaks will get a letter from Close decrying overdevelopment and slow
paramedic response.</TE>
<TE>   "We've made money in every mailing we've done," said Schubert, who
declined to divulge specifics. The most recent figures available,
before the mailers, showed secessionists had raised about $350,000.
Hahn's campaign against the measures has collected more than $3
million.</TE>
<TE>   New money will help bolster their poll numbers, breakup proponents
say.</TE>
<TE>   They point out that Proposition 13 built its support slowly. Three
months before the election, the proposition was viewed favorably by
35% of respondents in a Times poll. That was more than the percentage
of voters who opposed the initiative, but less than the share of
those undecided. Proposition 13 won by a 2-1 margin. In the Valley,
it got 81% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   "Howard Jarvis was ridiculed," said Richard Katz, co-chairman of
the San Fernando Valley Independence Committee. "The pundits, the
pollsters and everyone else failed to appreciate the depths of the
feelings that Proposition 13 tapped into."</TE>
<TE>   According to a Times poll in June, 52% of Valley voters supported
secession, 37% opposed it and the rest were undecided.</TE>
<TE>   Citywide, 38% favored the measure and 47% were opposed. The
Hollywood proposal trailed badly across the city, including in
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Hitting the Streets</TE>
<TE>   But Chuck Levin, field director for the secession campaign, said
volunteers have yet to walk precincts and that they will make a
difference. "There's certain to be a couple hundred [people], maybe
more than that," knocking on doors, Levin said.</TE>
<TE>   He refused to discuss plans in greater detail, other than to say
that secessionists have begun to telephone voters.</TE>
<TE>   Clarence Lo, a sociologist who has studied the tax revolt and the
secession movement, said Proposition 13's supporters also did not
have a concrete plan for mobilizing volunteers. But voters in 1978
were so incensed about property taxes that they organized on their
own, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Homeowners groups provided the infrastructure," said Lo, whose
book, "Small Property Versus Big Government," examines the
Proposition 13 crusade.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd go and set up tables and they'd go to the shopping centers
and gather signatures and give out literature.</TE>
<TE>   "The secession leaders are imagining themselves at the head of a
big movement storming the citadels again," Lo said.</TE>
<TE>   "But Prop. 13 was the heyday. It was the gold standard. Never will
we see it again. This is an echo of it, but it's definitely not as
strong," Lo said.</TE>

<HD>Carving Pumpkins and New Niche</HD>
<DH>Farming: Ventura County growers add attractions, such as
rides and crafts sales, to draw city dwellers to the annual fall
harvest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pumpkin connoisseurs know that searching for the perfect gourd is
half the fun. Disdaining the pre-picked selections at the
supermarket, they flock to the pumpkin patches that dot the county,
reveling in the "farm experience."</LD>
<LD>   But the simple pumpkin patches of a decade ago have evolved into
entertainment centers, complete with weekend craft festivals, free
concerts, elaborate animal exhibits and rides. This combination of
agriculture and entertainment--sometimes dubbed agri-tourism--doesn't
contribute much to Ventura County's billion-dollar farm economy.</LD>
<LD>   But some agriculture officials say the idea is catching on
throughout the state as more farmers jump on the bandwagon in the
hope that visiting families will develop an appreciation for
agriculture and become repeat customers.</LD>
<TE>   "Kids now have no association with the farm any more," said Craig
Underwood, owner of Underwood Farm Market and operator of Tierra
Rejada Family Farms in Moorpark. "That's what we're trying to bring
back. And it's hard to get people who are so busy to come out to the
farm to buy produce."</TE>
<TE>   The solution, he says, is to offer school tours and add more
farm-themed amusements to attract and entertain families. "The best
way to educate is to entertain," Underwood said.</TE>
<TE>   Judging from the enthusiastic reactions of 51 giddy preschoolers
on a recent school tour at Tierra Rejada, their approach is
effective. The children listened attentively to a short lesson on how
pumpkins are grown, then chattered excitedly during a 15-minute
horse-drawn hayride around the farm.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the other attractions--the wooden play structure in the
shape of a train, the giant pyramid of hay bales, the pygmy goats
scampering on an overhead ramp and the chance to pick out that
perfect pumpkin--that really captured their attention.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to get visitors to realize the importance of
agriculture in their lives, said Randii MacNear, longtime manager of
Davis Farmers Market and a regional representative of the North
American Farmers' Direct Marketing Assn., which promotes
agri-tourism.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of funny, because California has the least amount of
this activity happening, but we're the largest agriculture-producing
state," she said. "But it's a very interesting phenomenon that's just
starting to hit. It's an effort to get people to the farm any way you
can, so they can make a connection and understand that agriculture is
everywhere and that whatever you're eating, it came from a farm."</TE>
<TE>   But in an age of waning attention spans, farmers find they have to
constantly be on the lookout for new ideas to attract customers.</TE>
<TE>   "You always have to do something else," said Suzannah Underwood,
who manages special projects at Tierra Rejada and Underwood Farm
Market. "You just need to keep offering more things to bring people
in. And for those people who have come before, we want to give them
something new."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, visitors have come to expect hayrides, farm animal
displays and arts and crafts booths, putting the pressure on farmers
around the county to offer something extra to entice visitors to
their pumpkin patch.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Paula, Faulkner Farms is opting for variety, hoping to
draw people by offering 25 types of squash, Indian corn, gourds and
mini-pumpkins. At Tierra Rejada, farm managers are promoting their
new "mini-corn maze."</TE>
<TE>   And in Fillmore, a vintage train dubbed the "Pumpkinliner" will
make several weekend trips to a recently developed pumpkin patch
outside Fillmore, where visitors can view exhibits from a traveling
children's museum, watch pumpkin sculpting and visit with a "wicked
witch."</TE>
<TE>   The need to come up with new attractions concerns Rex Laird,
executive director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. He points to
the evolution of Knott's Berry Farm from a 20-acre parcel to a
160-acre amusement park and resort as an example of agri-tourism
running amok. "Where do you stop?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   While Laird believes there is the potential to develop a stronger
link between tourism and agriculture in the county, he cautions that
agri-tourism will never replace traditional farming.</TE>
<TE>   But Craig Underwood dismisses the idea that agri-tourism could
ever become that big. "You always want to see things improving," he
said. "There's always going to be that pressure. But this will always
be a farm, as far as we're concerned."</TE>

<LD>Authorities on Thursday were searching for a 23-year-old Laguna Hills
man accused of running away from an accident in which his baby son
was critically injured. Residents in the hilly Casa de Laguna
neighborhood where the accident occurred chased the man on scooters,
bikes and on foot, but he got away.</LD>
<LD>   The infant is in extremely critical condition at Mission Community
Hospital with multiple skull fractures and a bruised lung,
investigators said. Police are seeking the driver, who officers
identified as John Steidinger.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Steidinger was driving on curvy Santa Vittoria Drive
near Camino Jalisco about 9 p.m. Wednesday when he veered into an

<LD>Park Supt. David Mihalic has said he would rather resign than take
the helm at Great Smoky Mountains National Park.</LD>
<LD>   The National Park Service told Mihalic, 56, last month that he was
to swap jobs with Smoky Mountains park Supt. Michael Tollefson, 55.
Tollefson will now have to wait until Mihalic officially leaves Jan.
3 to take over at Yosemite.</LD>
<LD>   "I was the deputy superintendent [at Great Smoky Mountains] 15
years ago," Mihalic said. "Some of the same issues I dealt with at
the time are back on the table. I think it would just be best for the
National Park Service, best for the Great Smokies and best for me to
choose to retire."</LD>

<LD>The John Muir Medical Center has been ordered to pay $59.3 million to
the family of a 2-year-old girl injured during birth.</LD>
<LD>   A Contra Costa County jury found the hospital responsible for the
severe cerebral palsy suffered by Caitlin Greenwell.</LD>
<LD>   The girl's mother was admitted Oct. 21, 1999, and developed high
blood pressure, but her attorney said nurses did not notify a doctor
until later.</LD>
<TE>   When the doctor arrived, he diagnosed the mother with
pregnancy-induced hypertension and ordered her to be given
medication, but nurses testified that they did not think the mother
had hypertension, according to the lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   When the baby was born, she showed evidence of perinatal asphyxia,
which, the attorney said, led to her cerebral palsy.</TE>

<LD>Cattle ranchers say they have suffered $2.4 million in losses and
have been forced to cut their herds because scant rain for two years
has left rangelands without enough grass for grazing.</LD>
<LD>   The Tulare County Board of Supervisors declared a state of
emergency because of the drought, hoping to get some financial relief
from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Rainfall has been down about
75% over the last two years, said Jim Sullins of the UC Cooperative

<HD>Valley City Police Force Is Proposed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of City Council candidates on the San Fernando Valley
secession ballot said Thursday that the Valley should form its own
police force and increase the number of officers in the area from
1,500 to 4,000.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal is part of the candidates' "Vision Statement for the
San Fernando Valley."</LD>
<LD>   It was released Thursday by candidates Kim Thompson of the
proposed 1st District, Jose Roy Garcia of the 7th, Joyce Pearson of
the 8th, Ron Cleary of the 9th and Richard Leyner of the 13th.</LD>
<TE>   Pearson, an attorney, said a Valley city would pay for the
expanded police force with money saved from annual reductions in
separation payments that the new municipality would have to make to
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The payments would start at $127 million and drop by 5% a year.
Pearson said it would take about five years to hire 2,500 more
officers. "The new city would have flexibility to put [money] into
policing as a top priority," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Kam Kuwata, an advisor to Mayor James K. Hahn's anti-secession
campaign, scoffed at the candidates' proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "The city of Los Angeles is involved in increasing the police
force already and is actively recruiting," Kuwata said. "The
difference is in Los Angeles we are going to have the money to pay
for that. In a new Valley city, where they are talking about cutting
this tax and that tax, I don't know where they are going to find the
funds."</TE>
<TE>   The candidates' vision statement calls for drafting a master plan
for "controlled growth" in a new city, and giving neighborhood
councils a role in government decisions.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates also said a Valley city should determine whether
the Sunshine Canyon Landfill near Granada Hills can be phased out and
the trash burned to create energy.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, Valley mayoral candidate Keith Richman released his
blueprint for improving city services, which includes increasing from
one to four the number of rapid bus lines planned for dedicated
right-of-ways in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Richman also said a Valley city should lobby the state and federal
governments to fund construction of light rail or monorail lines
along the Ventura, San Diego and Golden State freeways.</TE>
<TE>   "A smart use of rail can help relieve freeway congestions [and] is
a much more cost-effective way to reduce congestion than the subway
system promoted by the downtown interests," Richman said.</TE>
<TE>   Kuwata said Richman's proposals were unrealistic, given the lack
of available funding. "There should be a big sign that says, 'Voter
Beware of Promises,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   The offices sought by the candidates will exist only if secession
wins in the Nov. 5 election.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hollywood secessionists said Thursday that they have
asked a county commission to prepare a petition for creating a
separate Hollywood school district. The district would be carved out
of the Los Angeles Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   The November secession measures have nothing to do with schools.
But secessionists argue that Hollywood's best chance of getting its
own school district is to first secede from the city.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way breaking up the LAUSD can be done is if Hollywood is
its own city because the city of Los Angeles will never allow it to
happen otherwise," said campaign manager Geoffrey Garfield. "They're
all about maintaining the status quo."</TE>
<TE>   School district breakups are subject to approval by the state
Board of Education. Last year, the board rejected a bid by Valley
residents to split two districts off from L.A. Unified.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Unified to Keep 16 Schools Segregated for Special
Education</HD>
<DH>Ruling: The decision by a federal judge was prompted by
parents' opposition to integration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI and SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge is allowing the Los Angeles Unified School District
to preserve 16 special education schools, prompted in part by
protests from parents who want their disabled children in sheltered
environments instead of integrated on regular campuses.</LD>
<LD>   The dispute over the 16 schools illustrates the passionate debate
surrounding special education.</LD>
<LD>   Some parents and experts insist that students whose disabilities
include blindness, cerebral palsy, mental retardation, autism and
learning problems will progress and become socially accepted if they
are mixed in with non-disabled students and given extra help. Such
parents were represented in a 1993 lawsuit, named after a
learning-disabled student, Chanda Smith, which alleged that special
education programs in Los Angeles were a failure.</LD>
<TE>   That suit led to a 1996 federal court order directing the district
to integrate about 35,000 special education students into mainstream
classrooms over the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   Other families worry that their children will be traumatized in
regular classrooms and that the children's needs will be overlooked
on campuses obsessed with academic test scores and football games.</TE>
<TE>   Those parents prevailed in the most recent court proceeding. The
decision will affect nearly 4,800 physically or mentally handicapped
students at the 16 special schools. Under the 1996 court order, the
school district would have been required to enroll non-disabled
majorities at those sites.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement to preserve the sites came after mediation between
the school district and advocates of mainstreaming. It was approved
last week by U.S. District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew, who had ordered the
original integration plan. Though the 16 schools will stay mainly
segregated for the disabled, the rest of the ambitious integration
plan is still in force.</TE>
<TE>   "We're delighted," said Harold Kwalwasser, general counsel for
L.A. Unified. "We always opposed the elimination of special education
schools .... The plan was simply a bad idea. It would not have
resulted in a better education for these students."</TE>
<TE>   Without the change, those 16 centers would have had to reduce
their enrollments of disabled youngsters to between 7% and 17% of
their total student bodies. The district's 660 regular campuses still
are supposed to increase their special education populations to a
similar range.</TE>
<TE>   Parents who want to keep the more sheltered schools include Alex
Gonzales, mother of a mentally retarded daughter who attends Miller
High School for the disabled in Reseda. Gonzales and others had
threatened to sue to prevent the 16 schools from being phased out.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales said parents and students were ecstatic when they heard
the news last week that Miller would stay as it is.</TE>
<TE>   "Every student deserves to be treated as an individual," she said.
"One-size-fits-all approaches to education are a recipe for
miscommunication and disaster."</TE>
<TE>   Catherine Blakemore, one of the attorneys who filed the initial
Chanda Smith lawsuit, said the recent mediation allowed parents on
both sides of the debate to do what they think is best for their
children.</TE>
<TE>   "We're striking a balance so that all children can get the
services that are most appropriate for them." she said.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 45,000 special education students, including
many with learning disabilities, are already integrated, at least part
time, at many regular Los Angeles schools.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 30,000 others attend segregated all-day classes at those
mainstream campuses, and will be more integrated by 2006 under the
court order. The 4,800 at the 16 sheltered centers can stay there if
their parents want.</TE>
<TE>   The integration will cost millions of dollars, district officials
say, for hiring classroom aides, training teachers and principals and
renovating buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the details are still being discussed in mediation.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Falvey, an education professor at Cal State Los Angeles who
co-wrote the district's integration plan, initially advocated phasing
out the 16 special schools.</TE>
<TE>   Although she supports the settlement, she said she hopes children
in those schools still will be exposed to the wider world.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think kids who attend those school have a right to
interaction with non-disabled peers," Falvey said. "Several of the
[special] schools have jump-started ways to create those
opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   She referred to the Alfonso B. Perez School in East Los Angeles, a
K-12 campus for 400 disabled students that also enrolls nearly 100
non-disabled students in kindergarten through third grades.</TE>
<TE>   Other special education campuses also have added non-disabled
preschools or activities that mix the groups, she said. Donnalyn
Anton, associate superintendent of special education for the
district, said the agreement shows that both sides can work together.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a strong, strong feeling among some parents of children
at these centers that they've made the best choice for their kids
where their kids are safe and getting programs that they need," she
said. "And there was a lot of resentment that someone else, some
court edict or plan, would tell them what the best placement of their
child was."</TE>
<TE>   Joy Efron, principal of Frances Blend school for the blind, who
has rallied public support for the separate schools, called the
agreement a "a great victory for students with disabilities and for
their families," she said. "This is a real validation of what special
schools do in terms of teaching specialized skills, access skills,
quality of life and self-esteem."</TE>

Yosemite tourists isn't the brother she remembers. Judge orders
defense to curtail repetitive testimony.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>When she took the witness stand Thursday and was asked if she knew
Yosemite killer Cary Stayner, his sister began to cry.</LD>
<LD>   Of course Cynthia Sartell knew him; he was her older sibling.</LD>
<LD>   But she said it wasn't the brother she remembers.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't believe that it was my brother who committed such
things," Sartell said as the defense presented his three sisters in
an effort to spare his life.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first day in the 2 1/2-month trial that any members of
Stayner's immediate family have shown up.</TE>
<TE>   Stayner, 41, faces the death penalty for the killings of Carole
Sund, 42, her daughter, Juli, 15, and their Argentine friend Silvina
Pelosso, 16, while they were staying at the motel where he worked as
a handyman outside Yosemite National Park in February 1999. Jurors in
August found him guilty of the murders.</TE>
<TE>   Sartell testified about the toll that the 1972 kidnapping of
younger brother Steven took on the family.</TE>
<TE>   She said her father became obsessed with finding the youngster,
who was held and sexually abused by a kidnapper for seven years.</TE>
<TE>   The family sent out fliers, Sartell said, and headed off on
distant road trips to talk to people who might have any information
about the missing child.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad was on a mission trying to find his son," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The family avoided watching the 10 p.m. news, and any mention of
Steven on TV would make their father cry.</TE>
<TE>   But the children in the family kept their feelings to themselves
and didn't discuss their emotions.</TE>
<TE>   "We were kind of on our own," Sartell said.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to keep quiet and not upset our parents."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the testimony that the defense has tried to introduce,
such as the molestation of one of Stayner's sisters by their father,
has been barred because of objections by the prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Thomas Hastings has said that the evidence is becoming
repetitive, and he has ordered Stayner's defense to tighten up
testimony so the case can go to the jury early next week.</TE>

<LD>A suspected car thief cornered by Costa Mesa police late Wednesday
was arrested after a standoff, police said. Rosendo Pedraza, 22, was
arrested about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday after police said he tried to
steal a 1989 Ford Probe from the parking lot of QSC Audio Products on
MacArthur Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   Costa Mesa Police spokesman Cpl. Garth Wilson said Pedraza drove
into a planter while trying to leave the parking lot shortly before
10 p.m. He got stuck and initially refused to leave the car when
police arrived. "We suspect he might have been under the influence of
a narcotic," Wilson said.</LD>
<LD>   The Ford belonged to a QSC employee who, with a co-worker, tried
to stop Pedraza, Wilson said, but he acted threateningly toward them.
"They ran into the building and called us," Wilson said.</LD>

<LD>Thirty-seven motorists were issued traffic citations this week for
failing to yield for pedestrians during a police sting operation at a
major Ventura intersection, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Police officials arranged the sting--in which officers posed as
pedestrians--after receiving several complaints about unlawful
drivers at Telephone Road and Cachuma Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   The citations were issued between 3 and 5 p.m. Wednesday. Similar
enforcement operations, officials said, will be conducted at major
intersections near schools and busy bus stops.</LD>

<HD>Residents Urged to Cut Water Use</HD>
<DH>Services: Rupture of a major DWP line in Valley reduces
flow, affecting whole city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All Los Angeles residents are being urged to cut water use and some
residents in the San Fernando Valley were told to boil tap water
Thursday after a major water line ruptured.</LD>
<LD>   Crews have been working around the clock to fix a 72-inch water
main that burst Wednesday in Arleta.</LD>
<LD>   Because the damaged line delivers water all over the city from a
major reservoir in Sylmar, all Department of Water and Power
customers are being asked to conserve as much water as possible until
the system is back to full strength, said Gerald Gewe, DWP assistant
general manager.</LD>
<TE>   "We're hoping to have all the repairs done within seven days,"
said Jim Yannotta, DWP assistant director for water quality. "In the
meantime, we're moving water around within the city."</TE>
<TE>   The boil-water order affecting about 2,000 residents in Pacoima
and Arleta was lifted late Thursday after testing determined there
was no danger.</TE>
<TE>   Late Wednesday, the DWP warned residents of the area roughly
bounded by Paxton Street, San Fernando Road, Branford Street and
Canterbury Avenue not to drink untreated water. They were told to use
bottled water or bring tap water to a rolling boil for at least one
minute.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday evening, city workers went door to door telling residents
that their water was safe.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the steel pipeline that burst was constructed about
1913 and broke because of age. The problem worsened Wednesday when a
nearby section of the same line collapsed while crews tried to
contain the gushing water.</TE>
<TE>   "It literally put a drain on the system," said DWP spokeswoman
Gale Harris.</TE>
<TE>   Many residents near the broken main may notice low water pressure
until repairs are complete, Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   The broken line sent water cascading down Woodman Avenue near
Devonshire Street on Wednesday. Several hundred nearby DWP customers
had no water or only a trickle coming out of their faucets, but their
service was restored by Thursday, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Will Yankee Fans' Arrival Turn Edison Field Into a China
Shop?</HD>
<DH>Sports: Game 3 of the playoffs is a chance for the
vociferous New York crowd to have some in-your-face time with the
more sedate Angel supporters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a certain swagger to the stride of a die-hard New York
Yankees fan, a cocksure royal strut propelled by Big Apple moxie and
the team's staggering history: 26 World Series championships and
counting, thank you.</LD>
<LD>   That hubris can really get under an Angel fan's skin.</LD>
<LD>   "They're just rude, corrupt and have a blatant disregard for the
people around them," fumed Mark Miller, 41, a Costa Mesa barber who
has hated the Yankees and their fans for a quarter-century--almost as
long as he's loved the Angels. "All the rude remarks--there's just no
intelligence to them. And they can't stand to lose. They have an
excuse every time they do."</LD>
<TE>   In a looming clash of baseball stereotypes, tonight's third
American League divisional playoff game between the Yankees and the
Angels--the first at Edison International Field--shoves West Coast
cool within elbow reach of the Yankees fans' notoriously high-octane
enthusiasm, in which insults are refined to an art form and abusing
opposing players is considered a birthright.</TE>
<TE>   Envision Mickey Mouse in shades next to Spike Lee.</TE>
<TE>   "Yankees fans are definitely louder," admitted Dave Metrick, who
grew up in Syracuse, N.Y., and fell in love with the Yankees while
watching former Yankee shortstop legend Phil Rizzuto announce games
over WPIX-TV out of New York City.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with the Angels fans, and I don't know if it's the
suburban location where there are more families at the games, but
they don't tend to be as intense," said Metrick, a 28-year-old
writer's assistant who lives in Palms, near Culver City. "I've been
to Yankee games at Anaheim where it seemed like the Yankee fans
outnumbered the Angels fans."</TE>
<TE>   A little time on the analyst's couch can shed some light on both
Yankee smugness and Angel resentment. It's almost Pavlovian. When a
team wins as much as the Yankees, fans expect victory. When a team
has struggled as much as the Angels, fans expect failure.</TE>
<TE>   And that engenders Yankee envy.</TE>
<TE>   "They're the easy target because they're the winners," said
Christian M. End, an assistant professor of psychology at the
University of Missouri-Rolla who has studied fan behavior for five
years. "The Yankees are where the Angels fans want their team to be."</TE>
<TE>   The team, which formed as the expansion Los Angeles Angels in
1961, is a relative newborn in baseball. Based in Anaheim since 1966,
the Angels are part of a broad local entertainment backdrop, and fans
are not as emotionally involved compared with fans in places like New
York--or Boston and Detroit, where the local baseball teams have been
part of the city identity for a century.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Yankee fans are made, not born, though Yankee faith often
is passed down generationally, like Catholic parents raising Catholic
children.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference is the socialization that has occurred over the
years," End said. "With the Yankees fans, they can say that their
father, their grandfather and their great-grandfather were Yankee
fans. Growing up in an environment like that is going to influence
their connection."</TE>
<TE>   How those fans behave depends in large part on what behaviors the
overall group tolerates, which in turn connects to the team's history
in the local community, End said. While Yankee fans might think
nothing of insulting opposing players, umpires and even poorly
performing Yankees, Angels fans are largely a polite lot.</TE>
<TE>   "We think of Yankee fans as being more passionate and emotional,
somewhat antisocial," End said. "In New York, over time, what is
transmitted to the fan as appropriate is the person who yells himself
hoarse yelling at the umps and the players, booing the other team.
It's a tougher fan."</TE>
<TE>   In Anaheim, he said, the group norm is calmer. Screamers are
ignored or glared at, and the subtle message from the group is
negative, which dampens the confrontational spirit that seems to rage
within the Yankee heart.</TE>
<TE>   "A true Yankee fan never tries to keep a low profile," said Ismael
Gonzalez, 47, of Corona, a New York native and Yankee fan who stood
in line with his 18-year-old son Alex last week to buy tickets for
the games at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   The son wore a Yankee cap, which made him a lightning rod for an
Angels fan who ignored peer pressure and heaped good-natured abuse on
him. Efrain Leanos, 33, of Garden Grove, also wearing a Yankee cap as
a Bronx cheer to the Angels fans, caught some abuse too.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been getting a little harassment," Leanos said, brushing it
off in typical Yankee-fan fashion. "It comes with the territory."</TE>
<TE>   Whereas the Yankees are owned by a group headed by the
larger-than-life George Steinbrenner, the Angels were founded by a
movie cowboy--Gene Autry--and are owned by Disney, a company that got
rich making cartoons and calls its fans "guests."</TE>
<TE>   Al Amura feels that Yankee distance, even though he was born and
raised in Irvine. Teenage friends hooked him on the Yankees a decade
ago and at age 28 his sense of connection with the Big Apple touches
even his business: Al's New York Pizza in Costa Mesa, where the walls
are covered with New York photos and other mementos.</TE>
<TE>   But no Yankee paraphernalia.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a California crowd, and I don't want to make my
bread-and-butter people mad at me," Amura said. "So I won't be
throwing a Yankee special out there."</TE>
<TE>   For Miller, the Costa Mesa barber and Yankee hater, tonight's game
will be a test of patience should a friend come through with an
expected extra ticket. If he goes, he knows the sea of Angels red in
the stands will be polka-dotted with Yankee blue, each speck
signifying a mouth ready to roar.</TE>
<TE>   And roar they will. For a Yankee fan to be quiet, he believes, is
to deny nature.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what it is, maybe high sugar intake," Miller
groused. "Or maybe it's just not enough good alcohol."</TE>

<KH>LOOKING BACK ON ANGEL HISTORY</KH>
<HD>No Closer, No Cigar</HD>
<DH>How would 1982 team fare against this year's wild cards?
Check pitching</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an era before fantasy leagues, this was a fantasy league team come
to life. In an era when Gene Autry rounded up superstars for his
baseball team and lavished money upon them, the 1982 Angels featured
future Hall of Famers Rod Carew and Reggie Jackson, surrounded by
such distinguished hitters as Don Baylor, Doug DeCinces, Brian
Downing, Bobby Grich and Fred Lynn.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels won 93 games that year, setting a franchise record that
stood for two decades. The Angels won 99 games this year, with a less
decorated and largely anonymous cast. As the stars of the 1982 team
pass along the label of "best team in club history" to the 2002 team,
they do so with the wistful reflection that they could not slug their
way into the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   "If we had a better pitching staff," DeCinces said, "we would have
been one of the best teams ever."</LD>
<TE>   The Angels last had a player voted into the starting lineup for
the All-Star game in 1986. Carew, Grich, Jackson and Lynn all started
the 1982 All-Star game. Jackson led the league in home runs. The
Angels drew 2.8 million fans, a franchise record that still stands,
and won the American League West championship.</TE>
<TE>   For all the excitement, all the success and all the home runs from
what Grich called "a powerhouse lineup that could score four or five
runs in a heartbeat," the Angels lost to the Milwaukee Brewers in the
playoffs. To Grich, the missing link is painfully obvious, a point
driven home every time he watches closer Troy Percival pump his fist
to punctuate another victory for this year's team.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had a Troy Percival on our team, we get to the World
Series," Grich said, "and we win 98, 99, 100 games, at least."</TE>
<TE>   Autry, tired of losing, spent heavily during the winter of
1981-82, signing Jackson away from the New York Yankees and catcher
Bob Boone away from the Philadelphia Phillies. The Angels also traded
for DeCinces, from the Baltimore Orioles, and infielder Tim Foli,
from the Pittsburgh Pirates.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a great effort on the part of every one of them to
prove they had been an integral part of winning," Manager Gene Mauch
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rookies were not welcome. The veteran-powered offense included the
AL most valuable players from 1973 (Jackson), '75 (Lynn), '77 (Carew)
and '79 (Baylor).</TE>
<TE>   "Many of them were past their prime," Mauch said, "but they were
still good players."</TE>
<TE>   There can be such a thing as too much talent, if the personalities
clash and if the players decide to rest on their laurels. On the
first day of spring training, for the first infield practice, Mauch
sent Carew to first base, Grich to second, Rick Burleson to shortstop
and DeCinces to third, with Foli shifting among the positions.</TE>
<TE>   On a dry desert field in Casa Grande, Ariz., many miles from a big
city and months from October, Mauch witnessed the pride and
professionalism that would fuel a championship team.</TE>
<TE>   "All the pitchers were standing behind the infielders. When the
practice was over, they all applauded," he said. "It was stimulating,
and it lasted the entire season, a consistent effort to prove why
they had been winners."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels hit more home runs in 1982 than they did this year, a
remarkable statistic given the tilt toward offense over the past two
decades. The 1982 team included five players with at least 20 home
runs; this year's team had three.</TE>
<TE>   In another telling sign of baseball evolution, and the
disappearance of the stigma surrounding the strikeout, this year's
team struck out the fewest times of any major league team this season
but more times than the 1982 team. Each team led the league in
sacrifice bunts, though the 1982 team had more than twice as many,
and each ranked second in the league in fielding.</TE>
<TE>   DeCinces suggested a current lineup, in Anaheim or elsewhere,
ought not to be compared to the star-studded 1982 lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even think you can put that team together again," he
said. "It would be too expensive."</TE>
<TE>   Had the rally monkey been born in 1982, it might have died of
exhaustion.</TE>
<TE>   "We never knew if we had enough runs," Mauch said. "Sometimes we
had to win the game two or three times. The lead would get away, we'd
win, the lead would get away again, and we'd win again, the lead
would get away again and we'd win again so we could finally go home."</TE>
<TE>   Ken Forsch, an Angel pitcher then and the assistant general
manager now, succinctly identified the key difference between the
team on which he played and the team he helped design.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at our pitching. Good lord," Forsch said. "That would be the
difference."</TE>
<TE>   The starters--Geoff Zahn, Tommy John, Bruce Kison, Mike Witt,
Steve Renko and Zahn--weren't bad. The team earned-run average ranked
second in the league then and now--3.82 then, 3.69 now.</TE>
<TE>   But the bullpen bordered on nonexistent. The Angels got 40
complete games, 12 apiece from Forsch and Zahn. This year's Angels
got seven complete games.</TE>
<TE>   These Angels led the league with 54 saves. Those Angels scraped
together 27--eight players had at least one, and no one had more than
eight.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have a closer. We didn't have much in the way of setup
guys," DeCinces said.</TE>
<TE>   In that sense, Forsch suggested a mythical series between the '82
Angels and the '02 Angels to determine the best team in franchise
history would be settled in favor of the current squad.</TE>
<TE>   "I always say good pitching beats good hitting," he said. "So draw
the rest of your conclusions from that statement."</TE>
<TE>   Grich called the mythical meeting "too close to call," but he
refused to concede that this year's pitchers could neutralize the
All-Star lineup of '82.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd have games of 7-6, 8-5, 9-8," he said. "It would be a fun
series.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see Darin Erstad and Freddy Lynn making diving plays, Troy
Glaus and DeCinces looking like Brooks Robinson. It would be a hell
of a series. I might even pay admission for that one."</TE>

<KH>ANGEL NOTES</KH>
<HD>Scioscia Still Cautious in His Use of Percival</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin; Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the surface, this appears silly, almost absurd. The Angels trust
closer Troy Percival to get four outs, but not five?</LD>
<LD>   Thus far, the defining issue of the Angel-Yankee playoff series
involves how Angel Manager Mike Scioscia uses his closer. If the
Angels need one out to escape the eighth inning, Scioscia will
consider using Percival. If the Angels need two outs to escape the
eighth, he says he will not consider using Percival.</LD>
<LD>   In the playoffs, managers commonly expand the role of the closer
beyond the ninth inning, because of the importance of the games and
because teams play no more than three consecutive days without a day
off. In his 53 playoff games, Yankee closer Mariano Rivera has
pitched 80 innings.</LD>
<TE>   But Rivera is more efficient in his work. Percival can be erratic,
and Scioscia is concerned that a high pitch count in the eighth
inning could weaken him for the ninth. He could get those two outs in
the eighth, but he might walk one or two along the way.</TE>
<TE>   "If he gets out of the eighth inning but he's thrown 23 pitches to
get the last two outs, and now he's going out there for another one,
he could throw 45 or 50 pitches," Scioscia said. "That is beyond
pushing the envelope. That's extending Troy into a situation we're
not comfortable with.</TE>
<TE>   "Troy's a little bit on the high end as far as pitch counts go,
but he does get the job done."</TE>
<TE>   Percival earned 40 saves this season, third in the American
League. He blew four saves, including two of four when he entered the
game in the eighth inning. In one of those blown saves, he walked
three and made a season-high 41 pitches in 1 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   But if he's on, he might be done with an inning in 10 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   "With the amount of pitches I throw sometimes, I might be able to
get six outs," Percival said. "Right now, it doesn't matter how I
feel. I'll go out there in whatever situation he asks."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels plan to use Jarrod Washburn and Kevin Appier on three
days' rest in the fourth game and, if necessary, fifth game of the
series. Washburn, 28, worked on three days' rest against Oakland last
month and pitched eight shutout innings.</TE>
<TE>   Appier, 34, said he has not started on three days' rest since the
1995 season. The Yankees put nine runners on base against him in five
innings Wednesday, on five hits, three walks and a hit batter.</TE>
<TE>   "Physically, I feel good," he said. "I only threw 91
pitches--granted, it was in five innings. But I should be fine to
pitch."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel reliever Ben Weber hopes to be available tonight after
X-rays revealed no fracture in the index finger of his right hand. In
the eighth inning of Wednesday's game, Weber instinctively stuck his
hand out at a ground ball, and the ball deflected off his hand for an
infield single that put the tying run on base.</TE>
<TE>   "If I let the thing go through, it's a double-play ball," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Shaikin</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yankee second baseman Alfonso Soriano, hit on the left shoulder by
a Percival pitch in the eighth inning Wednesday, said he expects to
play tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "It's bruised a little bit but it's OK," he said. "I put a lot of
ice on it [Wednesday] night and I'm OK."</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Rondell White, who strained a hamstring running to
first base Tuesday, might be available as a pinch-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although Angel starter Ramon Ortiz gave up a major league-leading
40 home runs this season, Yankee Manager Joe Torre said he doesn't
want players to fixate on the long ball.</TE>
<TE>   "He makes mistakes, and you have a chance to hit balls out of the
park, and we've done it probably as well as anybody," he said. "I
don't want our club to have the mentality of going out there thinking
we're going to think, 'Home run.' To me, most home runs come by
mistake. In other words, you swing, hit the ball hard, and it goes
out of the ballpark....</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully he makes enough mistakes where we could benefit, but
it's going to come down to pitching."</TE>
<TE>   Torre also said pitcher Orlando Hernandez, who pitched four
innings Wednesday and took the loss, won't be available today.</TE>

<HD>Mauch Ado About Nothing in 1982</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before there was "one strike away," there was "one win away."</LD>
<LD>   Before Angel fans cursed Dave Henderson, for the two-run, two-out,
two-strike home run that robbed the Angels of a World Series
appearance in 1986, Angel fans bemoaned a collapse in the 1982
American League championship series. The Angels won the first two
games of the best-of-five series against the Milwaukee Brewers, then
lost three in a row on the road and lost out on the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   As Angel Manager Mike Scioscia learned this week, when his failure
to use closer Troy Percival in a late-inning loss in the playoff
opener evoked howls of criticism across the country, postseason
managerial decisions are second-guessed, and third-guessed, and
fourth-guessed. Two decades after the collapse in Milwaukee, the
series is remembered here not for a villain such as Henderson but for
two decisions by Angel Manager Gene Mauch.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels whipped the Brewers in two games at Anaheim Stadium,
with Tommy John pitching a complete game in an 8-3 victory and Bruce
Kison pitching a complete game in a 4-2 victory. The series shifted
to Milwaukee, with the Angels one victory away from the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Don Sutton, who would pitch for the Angels in the 1986 playoffs,
beat them, 5-3, in the first game in Milwaukee. Geoff Zahn started
that game for the Angels, with Ken Forsch expected to start the next
day.</TE>
<TE>   That day could have been the highlight of Forsch's career, with
the chance to pitch the Angels into the World Series--and against the
St. Louis Cardinals, for whom Forsch's brother, Bob, pitched.</TE>
<TE>   But, on the day Sutton beat Zahn in the third game, Mauch told
Forsch he would not start the fourth game.</TE>
<TE>   Did Mauch explain why?</TE>
<TE>   "He tried to," Forsch said. "I didn't want to hear it."</TE>
<TE>   For the series, Mauch said, four starters were one too many, even
if the starters had not pitched on three days' rest during the
regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody does it now," Mauch said. "You've got a five-game
series. You're not going to go with four different pitchers. You want
to get that thing over with."</TE>
<TE>   The strategy backfired. The Angels lost the fourth game, 9-5; John
did not survive the fourth inning.</TE>
<TE>   In the fifth game, Kison could endure five innings but no more.</TE>
<TE>   "Kison didn't have any skin left on his middle finger," Forsch
said. "He had a blood blister. There was blood all over the ball
every time he threw. It was a really gutsy performance."</TE>
<TE>   Kison handed a 3-2 lead to a bullpen that was the Angels' weak
link all season. Luis Sanchez worked a scoreless sixth, but the
Brewers put the tying and winning runs on base in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Left-handed Cecil Cooper (.313, 32 homers, 121 RBIs) was the
batter. Mauch had left-hander Andy Hassler available but stuck with
Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   "Hassler might have gotten Cooper out," Mauch said, "but who's
going to pitch the eighth and ninth inning? I did what I knew had to
be done."</TE>
<TE>   That strategy backfired too. Cooper singled home two runs, and the
Brewers won, 4-3, to advance to the World Series. The Angels returned
home, losers of three games in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have much rather seen a left-hander facing Cecil Cooper,
I can tell you that," Angel third baseman Doug DeCinces said. "Cecil
was one of the best hitters at that time, and Andy was nasty against
left-handers. Gene just didn't have confidence in him, I guess."</TE>
<TE>   But DeCinces can sympathize with his old manager. DeCinces still
lives in Orange County and attends Angel games, and he sees in this
year's team the missing link from the 1982 team.</TE>
<TE>   "In Gene's defense, it wasn't like we could go get Percival,"
DeCinces said. "We just didn't have a guy like that."</TE>

<HD>Zito Tries to Silence Twin Fans</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>A half-hour before the Oakland Athletics were to play the New York
Yankees in Game 4 of the 2000 American League division series, A's
pitching coach Rick Peterson was making small talk on the bench with
Barry Zito, trying to loosen up the 22-year-old rookie left-hander
before the biggest start of his career.</LD>
<LD>   While Peterson asked Zito how many relatives were in New York for
the game, Zito slowly turned his head and took in a panoramic view of
Yankee Stadium, which was filling up in anticipation of a
series-clinching victory for the home team.</LD>
<LD>   "He didn't hear a word I said," Peterson recalled Thursday. "Then
he goes, 'Rick, this is the real Yankee Stadium, it's October, this
is what you dream your whole life about.' Most guys go into a
situation like that with fear, with doubt, with uncertainty. He
looked at it as a chance to test his talents, to find out how good he
is."</LD>
<TE>   The baseball-following public found out how good Zito was that
night when the kid limited the Yankees to one run and seven hits and
struck out five in 5 2/3 innings of an 11-1 Oakland victory,
outdueling New York ace Roger Clemens and staving off elimination for
the A's.</TE>
<TE>   And that performance may be the main reason why the A's believe
Zito, now 24 and a leading AL Cy Young Award candidate, will not be
rattled by the ear-splitting conditions produced by an expected
record crowd of nearly 60,000 inside the Metrodome for Game 3 of the
AL division series today.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I'm capable of rising to the occasion," said Zito, who
will oppose Twin right-hander Rick Reed with the series tied, 1-1.
"It's going to be loud and all that, but Yankee Stadium was loud
too.... It might be louder here, but if it's 10-15 decibels louder
than other places, what's the difference? Loud is loud."</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota would seem to have a huge home-field advantage, but will
it? "They have no idea what it's going to be like in here," Twin
first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz said of the A's. "We have no idea
what it's going to be like in here."</TE>
<TE>   This also will be a new experience for the Twins, who have not
played before such a large and vocal home crowd. What will be
familiar, though, is the Metrodome's concrete-like artificial
surface, the baggie over the right-field wall and the light-covered
roof that makes it difficult to track fly balls.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins went 54-27 at home and are built for a fast track,
relying on speed on defense and offense. But the noise will add a
degree of difficulty for them, as well as the A's.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have to change things defensively, use hand gestures
instead of calling for pop-ups," Mientkiewicz said. "You can't see
up, you can't see sideways. You might want to use a mouthpiece in
this game, because you could get hit in the face with a line drive."</TE>
<TE>   One player A's Manager Art Howe won't worry about is Zito, the
curveball specialist who has the ability to tune out all those
external forces that could distract lesser pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   "He's pitched well in Yankee Stadium, and that's got to be as
tough a place to pitch in the postseason as any place," Howe said. "I
think he loves the big stage; he's looking forward to the challenge."</TE>

<HD>Rangers Decide to Release Rocker</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Texas Rangers have decided they no longer require the services of
John Rocker. They put the one-time star closer on waivers Thursday
for the purpose of giving him his unconditional release.</LD>
<LD>   Rocker is 13-22 with 88 saves in 278 major league appearances with
Atlanta, Cleveland and Texas.</LD>
<LD>   In 1999, his first full major league season, he had 38 saves as
Atlanta went to the World Series. He had 24 saves for the Braves in
2000.</LD>
<TE>   The Braves traded him to Cleveland during the 2001 season, and he
went 3-7 with four saves and a 5.45 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   After John Hart quit as Cleveland's general manager and became the
Rangers' GM, he acquired the left-hander in a trade last Dec. 18.
Rocker was 2-3 with a 6.66 ERA and one save in 30 appearances with
the Rangers this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Grant Roberts of the New York Mets met with prosecutors
investigating his accusation that a woman used a picture of him
smoking marijuana in an extortion attempt. Queens District Attorney
Richard Brown said that prosecutors met with Roberts for about three
hours in his agent's office.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tom Gamboa, the Kansas City Royals' coach attacked by two men near
first base during the ninth inning of a Sept. 19 game in Chicago,
will be shifted to the bullpen next season. Gamboa will be replaced
in the first-base coaching box by Luis Silverio, a scouting
coordinator with the Royals.</TE>

<HD>Uncertainty Surrounds Brand</HD>

<DL>PALM DESERT</DL>
<LD>The Clippers said Thursday they expect to receive an update soon on
the condition of All-Star power forward Elton Brand, who underwent
arthroscopic surgery on his right knee last week.</LD>
<LD>   They're just not sure when.</LD>
<LD>   They're not yet certain when Brand will join his teammates to
begin rehabilitation exercises with the Clipper medical staff at
College of the Desert.</LD>
<TE>   He has not yet been cleared to travel by Craig Morgan, the
Wilmington, Del., orthopedic surgeon who performed the procedure,
although Coach Alvin Gentry said Thursday he hoped Brand would arrive
this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Brand could be sidelined for up to one month, and his status for
the Oct. 30 season opener against the Cleveland Cavaliers is
uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   Brand, the Clippers' leading scorer and rebounder last season,
injured his knee while training with Team USA in preparation for the
World Championship in August.</TE>
<TE>   An initial MRI exam taken after Brand hyperextended his knee
trying to block teammate Andre Miller's shot was negative. A second
exam last week revealed a slight tear of the lateral meniscus
cartilage.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More aggressive defense is among Gentry's top priorities.</TE>
<TE>   "I still say if we're going to be a running team, some of our
points are going to have to come off turnovers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to run off turnovers. You can't run the ball down
somebody's throat by taking the ball out of the net" after the
opposition scores.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 96.1 points a game the Clippers gave up last season, he
said, "If we could cut 1 1/2 points, it could really help our playoff
chances."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cherokee Parks, competing for a backup forward spot, was sidelined
for a second consecutive day because of flu-like symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing I need for him to do is to be around the guys and
have six guys sick," Gentry said.... Regular-season tickets go on
sale at 10 a.m. Saturday at the Staples Center box office,
TicketMaster and by phone at (800) 4NBA-TIX. They also can be
purchased online at www.clippers.com and www.ticketmaster.com.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers will hold auditions for national anthem singers at 10
a.m. Saturday at the Star Plaza entrance to Staples Center.
Information: www.clippers.com.</TE>
<TE>   Seven of eight Clipper exhibitions, starting with Tuesday's game
against the Lakers at Bakersfield, will be broadcast on flagship
station KXTA (1150).</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tight end Kellen Winslow Jr. and fullback Kyle Cobia of No. 1 Miami
may not start Saturday against Connecticut because of unspecified
violations of team policy, Coach Larry Coker said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In other news: A report in the Memphis Commercial Appeal said
Tennessee Coach Phillip Fulmer is upset that the NCAA, which has
tracked graduation rates since 1984, reported that only 8% of his
1995 recruiting class had graduated. The NCAA allows six years for
students to complete a degree program, and Fulmer said students who
leave early to play in the NFL or transfer drag down the graduation
rate. "The NCAA system is really not a valid measuring stick," he
said.... The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that an NCAA
investigator has interviewed five Palmetto High teachers, the
Williamston, S.C. school's football coach and the principal regarding
alleged rules violations involving South Carolina's recruitment of
running back Derek Watson. The paper reported last month that Watson
was driving a $62,000 Cadillac Escalade only months before enrolling
at South Carolina.</LD>
<TE>   During an interview with a Birmingham, Ala., radio station, former
Auburn coach Pat Dye, a Georgia graduate, said he expects No. 22
Alabama to defeat the No. 6 Bulldogs because "I don't believe
Georgia's man enough to beat Alabama." Dye didn't stop there, saying,
"Alabama is gonna line up and run the football and they're gonna play
defense and I don't believe Georgia is man enough to beat that." ....
Kansas State Coach Bill Snyder said Ell Roberson will start at
quarterback Saturday against Colorado. Roberson was impressive in
relief of Marc Dunn in the Wildcats' victory over USC.</TE>

<HD>Diamondbacks Missing Gonzalez</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>The Arizona Diamondbacks sure miss Luis Gonzalez.</LD>
<LD>   Without their most dangerous hitter, the defending World Series
champions scored three runs in the first two games of the National
League division series against St. Louis.</LD>
<LD>   Now, they're facing a quick exit from the postseason.</LD>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks managed six hits in a 2-1 loss to the Cardinals
in Game 2 on Thursday and must win three straight to avoid
elimination, beginning with Game 3 on Saturday in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   "When one guy gets hot, that's when a lot of guys get hot,"
catcher Damian Miller said. "You get timely hits, and you string hits
together. Lately, we just can't string any hits together and drive in
those runs."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez, who led the team with 28 homers and 103 runs batted in
this season, separated his left shoulder in a collision with
shortstop Tony Womack while the two were chasing a pop fly in St.
Louis on Sept. 23.</TE>
<TE>   The All-Star slugger hit 57 homers last year and has topped 100
RBIs four straight seasons. He got the game-winning hit in Game 7 of
the World Series last season against the New York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a sling on his left arm, Gonzalez threw out the first
pitch before Game 2 at Bank One Ballpark. He had surgery Monday and
vows he will be ready to play by the start of spring training.</TE>
<TE>   But the Diamondbacks need him now, in October.</TE>
<TE>   Without Gonzalez, they have 12 singles and two doubles in the
first two games of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Spivey, who led the team in batting (.301) and runs scored
(103) during the regular season, is two for 10 in the series. He
squandered a couple of RBI chances Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a good enough hitter to come up with big hits in big
opportunities, and I wasn't able to do it with two outs and runners
in scoring position," Spivey said.</TE>
<TE>   An error by St. Louis helped Arizona score its only run in Game 2,
on Quinton McCracken's RBI double in the eighth inning. Miller also
doubled for the Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   After Randy Johnson was roughed up in Game 1, the Diamondbacks
couldn't muster enough offense to support a strong outing from their
other ace, Curt Schilling.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little deflating when you've got those two big horses and
you're 0-2," Miller said. "It's not the best feeling in the world."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although he may miss the rest of the playoffs, Cardinal third
baseman Scott Rolen has no hard feelings toward Arizona's Alex
Cintron.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just one of those things that happen," said Rolen, who
injured his shoulder when Cintron ran into him on the basepaths. "He
made an aggressive play. That's what you're supposed to do. That's
the way you play the game."</TE>
<TE>   Said Cintron: "The ball, myself and Rolen came together. I didn't
see Rolen come charging the ball. I've got to run. He's got to charge
the ball. When you're running and it's 3-2, your mind is like 'You've
got to go.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The roof was closed at Bank One Ballpark, even though it was 74
degrees outside at game time. The reason given by Major League
Baseball was comfort of fans whose seats would have been in the sun.</TE>

<HD>No. 11 Florida State Outclasses Clemson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bobby Bowden defeated his son one more time Thursday night and said
this time it hurt.</LD>
<LD>   "I had to win the stinking game and I had to whip him to do it,"
Bowden said after No. 11 Florida State defeated son Tommy's Clemson
Tigers, 48-31, in an Atlantic Coast Conference game at Tallahassee,
Fla.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not fun when you whip your son. [But] I didn't tell him to
get into coaching."</LD>
<TE>   Bowden, 72, has won 328 games, including four in a row over his
48-year-old son. The 328 victories are two fewer than all time-leader
Joe Paterno of Penn State.</TE>
<TE>   The Seminoles (5-1, 4-0) showed little confidence in their passing
game and benched sophomore quarterback Chris Rix for most of the
second quarter, but capitalized on four Clemson turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Now Florida State's schedule gets significantly more difficult
with a game at No. 1 Miami on Oct. 12.</TE>
<TE>   "From what I see, it's Miami and the rest of the world," Bowden
said. "We're not at that level yet."</TE>
<TE>   But he was glad to bounce back from last week's 26-20 defeat at
Louisville.</TE>
<TE>   "Clemson is playing with a lot of confidence and enthusiasm,"
Bowden said. "They scared us."</TE>
<TE>   Greg Jones ran for three touchdowns, breaking eight tackles on the
final scoring run, and set up a fourth with a long run that helped
the Seminoles take a 28-24 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Seminoles took advantage of poor special teams play by Clemson
(3-2, 1-1) to take the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who gained 160 yards last year at Clemson, finished with
165 yards in 22 carries to give the Seminoles their 11th consecutive
victory over Clemson since they joined the ACC in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Clemson guard Nick Black was taken out on a stretcher after he
broke his right leg in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 31, Illinois 10--Terry Jackson II rushed for a
career-high 159 yards and Thomas Tapeh added 113 yards and a
touchdown to lead the Golden Gophers past the defending Big Ten
champions at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota quarterback Asad Abdul-Khaliq completed 15 of 27 passes
for 144 yards, throwing one scoring pass and an interception for
Minnesota (5-1, 1-1), which rebounded from last week's 28-15 loss to
Purdue.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Lloyd caught five passes for 139 yards for the Fighting

<HD>Millwood Delivers What Braves Need</HD>
<DH>National League: Lopez and Castilla hit back-to-back homers
in 7-3 victory over Giants, evening series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>All those numbing Octobers have helped to enlighten the Atlanta
Braves, who can sense playoff disaster long before it starts.</LD>
<LD>   The Braves saw another storm on the horizon and at least
temporarily changed course Thursday night with a 7-3 victory over the
San Francisco Giants in Game 2 of the National League division
series.</LD>
<LD>   They rebounded in what players acknowledged was a must-win game
before 47,167 at Turner Field, pulling even in the best-of-five
series behind six solid innings from starter Kevin Millwood and the
hot hitting of Javy Lopez and Vinny Castilla.</LD>
<TE>   The Nos. 6 and 7 batters, coming off strong performances in the
opener, became only the second tandem in club history to hit
consecutive postseason home runs, connecting for solo shots against
ineffective Giant starter Kirk Rueter in a three-run second as the
Braves jumped ahead, 4-1. Chipper Jones' run-scoring single in the
first got everything started and seemed to have a calming effect on
the team.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves broke the game open in the fourth and chased Rueter,
scoring three runs to take a 7-1 lead, Mark DeRosa cueing a two-run
triple just inside the right-field line to land the knockout blow.</TE>
<TE>   That pretty much reduced the game to Barry Bonds against the
Braves, with fans sticking around to watch the future Hall of Famer
swing his bat.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds struck out and grounded out against Millwood and flied out
against reliever Mike Remlinger in the seventh. Closer John Smoltz,
working with a five-run cushion in the ninth, challenged Bonds and
Bonds won, leading off with a homer to right.</TE>
<TE>   Smoltz struck out the next three batters and Atlanta remained
perfect in his last 50 appearances. The Braves could have been on the
wrong end of a 2-0 deficit in the short series, but now they're
feeling good again with play shifting to Pacific Bell Park for Game 3
on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, we knew that this was a must-win game for us," said
catcher Lopez, who also homered in Game 1. "We didn't want to go to
San Francisco with the series, 2-0. No way did we want that to
happen."</TE>
<TE>   The sentiment was unanimous.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows how difficult it is to win ballgames [at Pacific
Bell Park], let alone going in there down, 2-0," right fielder Gary
Sheffield said.</TE>
<TE>   "Chipper picked us up big time, he put that run on the board and
it helped us relax a little bit, and Millwood was throwing
outstanding."</TE>
<TE>   Millwood earned his third postseason victory on a night he wasn't
initially scheduled to pitch, having swapped places with Greg Maddux
because of the four-time Cy Young Award winner's blister problem. The
18-game winner delivered the stabilizing performance the Braves
needed, giving up only three hits, including solo homers to J.T. Snow
in the second and Rich Aurilia in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox removed Millwood after 72 pitches
because he suffered a slight groin injury while beating Kenny Lofton
to the first-base bag in the sixth for an out.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't get sore from it until after I had come out of the
game," the right-hander said. "I started feeling a little bit sore,
but nothing that's going to affect anything.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I had a little more zip on my fastball. My slider was
just a little bit harder, and I thought I threw a couple of
curveballs harder than I have all year."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't a good night for Rueter.</TE>
<TE>   In his previous two career playoff appearances, the left-hander
had given up only seven hits and one earned run in 11 1/3 innings.
The Braves matched that hit total and scored seven runs (six earned)
in only three-plus innings against Rueter.</TE>
<TE>   "It appeared they had a pretty good game plan against Kirk," Giant
Manager Dusty Baker said. "Earlier in the go around, it looked like
they were taking the first pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "Then Vinny Castilla and [Lopez], they came up swinging at the
first pitch, so they sort of changed their game plan in the middle,
and Kirk got some balls up."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez and Castilla combined for 826 feet worth of homers in the
three-run second. Lopez led off with a 421-foot blast to left-center
on a 1-1 count, and Castilla drove Rueter's next pitch over the glove
of center fielder Lofton for a 405-foot shot.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Klesko and Brian Jordan were the only other Atlanta teammates
to hit consecutive homers in the playoffs, accomplishing the feat
against the New York Mets in Game 4 of the 1999 NL championship
series at Shea Stadium.</TE>

<HD>Lopez, Castilla Hit When It Counts</HD>

<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Catcher Javy Lopez and third baseman Vinny Castilla were chiefly
responsible for the Atlanta Braves' failure to produce as expected on
offense this year despite the off-season acquisition of slugger Gary
Sheffield.</LD>
<LD>   But the Braves won't care as long as the Nos. 6 and 7 batters
continue their hot hitting in the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Lopez and Castilla hit consecutive home runs Thursday night in a
7-3 victory over the San Francisco Giants in Game 2 of the National
League division series, helping the Braves even the best-of-five
series.</LD>
<TE>   Lopez batted .233 with 11 homers and 52 runs batted in this season
but is hitting .375 with two homers and three RBIs in the division
series.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like things start happening to me in the postseason," said
Lopez, selected the most valuable player of the 1996 NL championship
series. "My approach, my stance, everything is pretty much the same,
but things just start falling into place in the postseason."</TE>
<TE>   Castilla, bothered by a wrist injury, hit .232 with 12 homers and
61 RBIs. He went homerless in 177 at-bats in July and August, but hit
three homers in September after taking cortisone shots and is three
for six against the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   "The season is over and it's the playoffs now," Castilla said.
"I'm concentrating and I'm feeling good. I know I didn't hit the way
I wanted to hit, the way I know how to hit, during the season, but I
know I can now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds homered down the right-field line leading off the
ninth inning against John Smoltz, hitting a 97-mph fastball and even
impressing Atlanta's All-Star closer.</TE>
<TE>   "Fastball up that did not get in," Smoltz said. "There's not very
many guys who could have kept that ball fair, and he did."</TE>
<TE>   Smoltz won't back down against Bonds--unless that's the right
move.</TE>
<TE>   "As I've said before, I'm going to attack him if it doesn't mean
anything," said Smoltz, who was working with a five-run lead when
Bonds homered. "But I'm going to pitch totally different regarding
the situation. That does affect the way you pitch him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Greg Maddux, bumped to Game 3 on Saturday because of a blister, is
ready to go, Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, absolutely ... and he could go into the late innings with
it," Cox said. "It's a lot better."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Schmidt, scheduled to face Maddux at Pacific Bell Park, had
a 2.37 earned-run average at home this season--and a 5.02 ERA on the
road.</TE>

<LD>The big day is two weeks away, but Lee Brandon's competitive juices
already are beginning to boil.</LD>
<LD>   As defending women's champion in the World Long Drive
Championships, all eyes will be on her and opponents will be gunning
for her.</LD>
<LD>   But Brandon, 40, said she isn't nervous. She said she's just happy
to be competing and something tells you it isn't some tired cliche.</LD>
<TE>   Brandon is happy to be alive.</TE>
<TE>   During her junior year in high school in 1979, Brandon nearly died
after she accidentally put her left arm through a glass window. The
glass sliced open an artery and nearly severed her arm at the elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon's heart stopped on the operating table as doctors worked
to reattach the arm, but they managed to restart it and saved her
arm.</TE>
<TE>   That's the same arm she used to launch a drive 291 yards 3 inches
last October to win the long drive title by more than six yards.</TE>
<TE>   "I never would have thought I could win this thing," said Brandon,
who at 5 feet 11 with golden hair has earned the nickname "Blonde
Bomber." "Heck, I used to make fun of golfers."</TE>
<TE>   Before the accident, Brandon was an aspiring Olympian. She was
nationally ranked in the discus and shotput, but it took seven years
to regain feeling in her arm and she gave up dreams of competing.</TE>
<TE>   She turned to coaching and in 1988 became an assistant strength
and conditioning coach for the New York Jets. She was the first
female strength coach in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   After that, Brandon started a private strength and conditioning
practice in Brentwood and took up golf to help a client in 1997. She
took lessons but didn't own a driver until her instructor suggested
she try the long drive competition.</TE>
<TE>   "He was like, 'The woman who won last year hit it 249 yards, you
can do that with a four-wood,' " Brandon said.</TE>
<TE>   And thus, at 39, Brandon once again became a competitive athlete.</TE>
<TE>   "It's funny how the universe twists things around," she said. "I
mean, my life as a competitor was over at age 17. I felt like I lost
my life and my goals as I knew them. I achieved a lot of joy in
coaching and creating champions, but never thought I'd be one again.
How many women at age 39 think about competing in anything?"</TE>
<TE>   Brandon is serious about defending her title. She has trained hard
over the last year, adding seven to eight mph to her swing speed,
which is now 111-117 mph. (Tiger Woods is about 125). Her career long
drive in competition is 327 yards, but she says she has hit one 347
on the course.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Brandon, a 15 handicap, doesn't want to put too much
pressure on herself to win at the finals Oct. 16-19 in Mesquite, Nev.
She has only one goal.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to hit six balls flush," she said. "A lot of
competitors are out there swinging for the fences, I'm just trying to
hit the ball. Other than that, I'm just going to enjoy being there
and being alive."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Springing Into Action</TE>
<TE>   The Royal and Ancient Golf Club, which governs the rules of golf
everywhere but the U.S. and Mexico, announced Tuesday that it would
limit the spring-like effect on drivers at the British Open next
year, bringing the British in line with the three other majors.</TE>
<TE>   The coefficient of restitution, a measurement of how quickly a
ball springs off a clubface, will be set at 0.83--the same as the
USGA limit.</TE>
<TE>   Until Tuesday's R&amp;A ruling, players could use the thin-faced
drivers at the British Open or World Golf Championships held
overseas, but not on the PGA Tour or the three American majors--the
Masters, U.S. Open and PGA Championship.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Happy Trails,</TE>
<TE>   Ocean Trails?</TE>
<TE>   Donald Trump's deal to buy Ocean Trails Golf Course is still in
escrow and it's not expected to close until late November, but Trump
apparently is moving forward with plans to turn the oceanfront course
into a private country club.</TE>
<TE>   The California Coastal Commission has a restriction in its deed
with Ocean Trails that stipulates the course must remain public, but
sources close to the negotiations say Trump has been lobbying the
commission to have the restriction removed.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard rumors that he's interested in privatizing," Rancho
Palos Verdes City Manager Les Evans said. "It's possible that the
deed restriction could be removed, but going through the Coastal
Commission is like swimming through an ocean of sharks."</TE>
<TE>   Trump purchased Ocean Trails in August, despite a history of
problems at the course. A chunk of land around Ocean Trails' 18th
hole plunged into the Pacific in June 1999, just before the course
opened. Two other holes--the 9th and 12th--were closed during
subsequent preparations to ready the course for play.</TE>
<TE>   Repairs are continuing under owner Credit Suisse First Boston and
the new holes are expected to open in June 2003. Trump owns two other
golf courses: Trump International in Florida and Trump National in
New York. Both are exclusive private courses with initiation fees
reportedly at $300,000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Old School</TE>
<TE>   The youth movement has earned a lot of attention on the PGA Tour
this season, but the 40-and-over sector has come on strong in recent
weeks. Loren Roberts, 47, won the Texas Open last week, becoming the
third winner in six weeks over 40. He is the oldest tour winner since
Tom Watson won the MasterCard Colonial at age 48 in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Six of the top 10 finishers in the Texas Open were over 40,
including Fred Couples, whose tie for second was his best finish
since winning the 1998 Memorial.</TE>
<TE>   Couples, who turned 43 Thursday, wasn't concerned about the age of
the players in the hunt. All he knew was that Fred Funk, 46, took the
lead with birdies on Nos. 7, 8, 9, 11, 12 and 13 before he wound up
tied with Couples for second.</TE>
<TE>   "I never even thought about [their ages]," he said. "What crossed
my mind is that Fred Funk is 16 under and going crazy. I don't really
look at them different, whether they're 22 or 50."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He Forgot the Alamo</TE>
<TE>   For Funk, it was his fourth runner-up finish this year, but his
wife's family might have been the biggest loser. Had he won, Funk
said he would have taken his wife Sharon and her parents on an
all-expenses-paid trip to Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   But after the tie for second in San Antonio, Funk said he'd take
them someplace else.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably down to Austin," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Analyze This</TE>
<TE>   Andy Miller, son of NBC analyst Johnny Miller, won for the first
time as a professional last week at the Buy.com State Farm Open in
Rancho Cucamonga.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, who got in the tournament as a Monday qualifier, is the
fifth son of a former PGA tour winner to win on the Buy.com tour. The
others were Briny Baird (father was Butch), Hugh Royer III (Hugh),
Guy Boros (Julius) and Dave Stockton Jr. (Dave). Stockton Jr. was in
a four-man playoff with Miller at Empire Lakes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Team Matches Beeming</TE>
<TE>   PGA Championship winner Rich Beem has been added to the field for
the Hyundai Team Championships Nov. 15-17 at Monarch Beach Golf
Resort in Dana Point.</TE>
<TE>   Beem will team with Australian Peter Lonard in the team match-play
event. Jerry Kelly and Chris Smith have also been added, as have
Peter Jacobsen and Scott McCarron. Defending champions Couples and
Mark Calcavecchia also will complete in the PGA Tour portion of the
field.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Doyle and Dana Quigley are defending champions in the Senior
PGA Tour matches and Janice Moodie and Lorie Kane won the LPGA
matches last year. The remaining teams in the senior and LPGA fields
will be announced in the coming weeks.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gary Tanaka, the London-based investment executive, has been buying
racehorses since 1993, but don't look for him at one of those
high-priced Kentucky auctions, bidding against Middle East
petrodollars or American plutocrats for well-bred bloodstock.</LD>
<LD>   "I've never bought a horse at auction," Tanaka said. "Half the
horses sold that way never win a race, and of the other half you're
lucky if they win anything more than a maiden race."</LD>
<LD>   Tanaka mainly shops for horses who have already run in Europe,
where they've established a semblance of form and where prices don't
push the roof.</LD>
<TE>   "The purses are much lower in Europe than they are in the U.S.,"
the 59-year-old Tanaka said. "I hate to say it, but the purses are
pathetic over there. But as a result, the horses don't cost as much,
either. You get more bang for your buck."</TE>
<TE>   Tanaka's buying strategy works. His stable earned $4.4 million
last year to finish seventh nationally, and this year, with $2.5
million in purses, he's No. 10 on the list. Tanaka's 2002 total could
mushroom this weekend at Santa Anita, where he runs Golden Apples on
Saturday in the $500,000 Yellow Ribbon and Sarafan on Sunday in the
$300,000 Clement L. Hirsch Memorial Turf Championship.</TE>
<TE>   Golden Apples is a 4-year-old Irish-bred filly who won the Del Mar
Oaks last year, in her first start for Tanaka after four races in
Ireland. This year, Golden Apples has earned $640,000 in four starts.
She has bookend wins in the Santa Ana Handicap at Santa Anita and the
Beverly D. at Arlington Park around second-place finishes in the
Santa Ana Handicap and the John Mabee Ramona Handicap at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Rain last weekend makes Golden Apples' assignment especially
difficult in the Yellow Ribbon, a race Tanaka won with Donna Viola in
1996. Banks Hill, last year's Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf
winner at Belmont Park, was to have run in last Saturday's Flower
Bowl there, but when the course came up soft, trainer Andre Fabre
shipped her across the country for the Yellow Ribbon. Banks Hill has
won only one of four starts since her Breeders' Cup win, but she has
been butting heads with males in France and England, and at the end
of her last start, at Longchamp, she was only half a length behind
Rock of Gibraltar, probably the best miler in training.</TE>
<TE>   This is the field for the 1 1/4-mile Yellow Ribbon, with jockeys
in post-position order: Noches De Rosa, Alex Solis; Nepenthe, Mike
Smith; Golden Apples, Pat Valenzuela; Voodoo Dancer, Gary Stevens;
Banks Hill, Corey Nakatani; and Viernes, Jose Valdivia. Valenzuela,
who rode Golden Apples for the first time in the Beverly D., had
three winners Thursday at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   It will be raining Breeders' Cup preps at Santa Anita, Belmont and
Keeneland this weekend, and besides the Yellow Ribbon, the rest of
the card Saturday in Arcadia includes the $200,000 Norfolk for
2-year-olds; the $200,000 Ancient Title Handicap for sprinters and
the $250,000 Oak Tree Mile for grass horses.</TE>
<TE>   Keeneland's heavy-duty weekend kicks off today with the $500,000
WinStar Galaxy and the $400,000 Alcibiades. Affluent, a Santa Anita
shipper and the filly who beat Golden Apples in the Ramona, is
running in the Galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   The Thoroughbred Corp.'s Atlantic Ocean, one of the contenders for
the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies at Arlington on Oct. 26 and winner
of the Kentucky Cup Juvenile Fillies in her last start, will face
eight rivals in the Alcibiades.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Summer Wind Dancer is expected to run in the California Cup
Juvenile Fillies on Nov. 2 after her three-quarter-length win
Thursday in the $81,795 Cover Gal Stakes at Santa Anita. The
2-year-old filly, winning her first stake, had run twice at Del Mar,
beating maidens and finishing third in a sprint stake.... Robert
Mikols, the 63-year-old Long Island, N.Y., crane operator who struck
trainer Marjorie Cordero with his car in a hit-and-run incident early
last year, has pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of a fatal
accident. Mikols is expected to be sentenced to six months in jail
and five years' probation. Cordero, who was 41, was the wife of Hall
of Fame jockey Angel Cordero.</TE>

<LD>An administrative oversight will cost Orange High's football team its
34-20 victory over Fullerton Sunny Hills on Sept. 21. With the
forfeit, the Panthers entered their Golden West League opener against
Santa Ana Saddleback on Thursday night with a 1-2 nonleague record.
Sunny Hills improved to 3-0.</LD>
<LD>   Orange Athletic Director Edward Howard said he failed to turn in
paperwork to Southern Section officials for a junior who had
previously attended Orange El Modena as a freshman through an
intradistrict transfer.</LD>
<LD>   The player, a starting cornerback this season, returned to Orange
midway through his sophomore year but didn't decide to play football
until the start of this school year.</LD>
<TE>   Corona had to forfeit its only victory this season, a 40-17 win
over Riverside King on Sept. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Section spokesman Thom Simmons said the team played a
14-year-old freshman in the game but had not turned in paperwork that
would allow the section to waive the 15-year-old age requirement for
varsity competition.</TE>
<TE>   Corona's record falls to 0-3 and King improves to 2-0-1.</TE>

<TE>   An undiagnosed case of mononucleosis hampered Laura Meyers of
Sierra Madre Maranatha during the second half of the 2001
cross-country season, but the senior has looked stronger than ever in
winning her first four races of this season.</TE>
<TE>   Meyers won the Division IV race of the Bell-Jeff Invitational at
Griffith Park last Saturday with a 17-minute 12-second clocking over
the 2.8-mile course. It moved her to sixth on the all-time course
performer list.</TE>
<TE>   "I've added a hard tempo run to my training this year and it has
really made a difference in how I feel," Meyers said.</TE>
<TE>   Meyers won the 1999 Southern Section Division V title as a
freshman in her first season of competition. After finishing fourth
in the state Division IV final as a sophomore, she fell to 11th in
the state Division IV final as a junior.</TE>
<TE>   Postseason tests revealed that Meyers had mononucleosis, but that
gave her peace of mind. "It was actually kind of a relief to know
that something was physically wrong with me," she said. "That it
wasn't just something in my head."</TE>

<TE>   Point guard Jennifer Katsuyama of Brea Olinda has committed to San
Francisco. Katsuyama, who missed most of last season because of a
torn anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee, suffered a torn
ACL in her left knee at the end of July. Based on last year's
recovery period, she should return in December.</TE>

<HD>Tustin Wins With a Last Stand</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An offensive outburst Thursday night between Tustin and Anaheim
Western highs turned into a defensive standoff in the second half.</LD>
<LD>   Tustin proved to be slightly better in both, outscoring the host
Pioneers in the first half and ending the game with a goal-line stand
that preserved its 28-21 victory.</LD>
<LD>   The victory prevented the Tillers from starting 0-4 for the first
time since 1994, when they finished 1-9. It also gave them some
much-needed momentum heading into next week's final nonleague game
against Mission Viejo, the defending Southern Section Division II
champions.</LD>
<TE>   However, the Tillers lost another starter to injury--left guard
Abel Gonzalez suffered a knee injury on the first offensive play of
the game--and played without their second-leading rusher, Eric Lover,
who was injured in last week's loss to Anaheim Servite.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to have to find a way to speed up the clock against
Mission Viejo," Tustin Coach Myron Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Miller altered his lineup, moving Sam Baker and Chris Barrett, two
of the highest-rated high school football players in the country,
into new positions.</TE>
<TE>   Baker, a 6-5, 315-pound guard, changed jersey numbers and switched
to tight end in the wing-T offense, while Barrett, a 6-5, 250-pound
tight end, moved to wingback.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted them to be able to block the guys on the outside,"
Miller said. "That way we could turn the corner easier."</TE>
<TE>   Marquis Malcom was the beneficiary of the plan, rushing 37 times
for 204 yards and three touchdowns. The Tillers were so confident of
their rushing attack, they went for it on all eight fourth-down
situations, converting five.</TE>
<TE>   Western (3-1), the top-ranked team in Division IX, stayed with
Tustin through the first half, scoring on a 57-yard touchdown pass
from Glenn Deans to Brian Williams with 42 seconds remaining and
cutting the Tustin's lead to 22-21.</TE>
<TE>   Western running back Jeron Johnson matched Malcom on the ground in
the first half, gaining 120 yards in six carries. He finished with
224 yards in 17 carries, including runs of 47, 52 and 58 yards.</TE>

<TE>   Westlake Village Westlake 28, Agoura 23--The Warriors clinched the
Marmonte League opener at Agoura when Charger quarterback Dustin
Croick's 44th pass of the game went off the fingertips of a diving
Andy Christopher in the end zone with no time remaining after it had
bounced off the hands of at least two defenders.</TE>
<TE>   Westlake (2-2) took a 28-17 lead with 10:29 left to play on a
one-yard quarterback sneak by Eric Vose. But Agoura narrowed its
deficit to 28-23 with 4:17 left when Christopher caught a 33-yard
touchdown pass from Croick on a fourth-and-10 play.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Mackins returned the ensuing kickoff 68 yards for
Westlake, but the Warriors turned the ball over on downs at the
Agoura 27-yard line with 1:42 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Croick, who completed 23 of 44 passes for 244 yards and two
touchdowns, had four completions on the ensuing drive to give the
Chargers a first down at the Westlake 19. But his final three passes
into the end zone fell incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   Agoura led, 17-14, at halftime after Westlake committed four
turnovers. But Westlake, helped by the bruising running of Merrill
Mullaly, scored touchdowns on its first two possessions of the second
half. Mullaly rushed for 128 yards and two touchdowns.</TE>

<LD>Two Breeders' Cup preps headline the opening day program at
Keeneland.</LD>
<LD>   Atlantic Ocean, a $1.9 million purchase by the Thoroughbred
Corporation earlier this year at Barretts, will try for her third
victory in a row in the $400,000 Alcibiades, a Grade II for
2-year-olds at 1 1/16 miles.</LD>
<LD>   Two races later, Ramona Handicap winner Affluent will go for her
sixth graded stakes victory against Surya and five others in the
$500,000 Winstar Galaxy at 1 3/16 miles on the grass.</LD>
<TE>   Trained by Bob Baffert, Atlantic Ocean, a daughter of Stormy
Atlantic, was beaten as the favorite in her first two starts, but has
won two in a row since stretching out to two turns.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Bailey will ride Atlantic Ocean for the first time today as
she prepares for the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies on Oct. 26 at
Arlington Park.</TE>
<TE>   With Eddie Delahoussaye not riding after being involved in a spill
at Del Mar, Pat Day takes over on Affluent.</TE>
<TE>   The Affirmed filly is proven over the Keeneland turf.</TE>
<TE>   She won the Queen Elizabeth II Cup about a year ago, beating,
among others, Golden Apples.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, at Belmont Park, there is a two-day carry over of
$111,447 in the pick six.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest upsets Thursday were provided by first-time starter
Doubtful Diva ($100.50) in the fourth and Meadow Belle ($127) in the
sixth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Crackup, an impressive maiden winner, will take
on nine other 2-year-olds in the seven-furlong $75,000 Cavonnier

<TE>   Who's hot: John Velasquez, who comfortably leads the Belmont Park
jockey standings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Heberto Castillo Jr., who began the season at Belmont
Park with only one win from his first 40 mounts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Conned Again in the

<LD>The Lakers and Sacramento Kings don't have to like each other, and
isn't that a wonderful thing?</LD>
<LD>   It is early October, Shaquille O'Neal has barely bounced a
basketball, no one has played so much as an exhibition game, and
already Shaq speaks and Mike Bibby smacks and Chris Webber sneers and
Phil Jackson opines.</LD>
<LD>   Responding to O'Neal's media-day observation that the Kings "won't
ever have what it takes," Bibby and Webber said the Laker
championship ought to carry an asterisk, denoting what they've
insisted was biased officiating in Game 6 of the Western Conference
finals.</LD>
<TE>   "You're supposed to be the best team," Bibby told the Sacramento
Bee, "and you get the most help."</TE>
<TE>   Bibby also predicted the Kings would win 70 games.</TE>
<TE>   For their sakes, Jackson said thinly, he hoped so.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the year that if they don't survive, then they'll be
history. They'll be folders if they don't survive that playoff
pressure this year," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   And, another thing, Jackson said: Were it not for Kobe Bryant's
food poisoning between Games 1 and 2, the Kings might have been
swept.</TE>
<TE>   "My ultimate belief," Jackson added, "is that if Kobe hadn't
gotten sick, perhaps that would have been a four-game series."</TE>
<TE>   Told a handful of Kings hadn't taken warmly to his training-camp
assessment of their organization, O'Neal shrugged and held up three
fingers, one for each championship ring.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell them to go through training camp, forget about last year,"
he said. "It's a new year. Don't talk about old [stuff]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While the Kings added Keon Clark, who might roll into their camp
one of these days, Jackson said the critical element for the Kings
has been there all along: Vlade Divac.</TE>
<TE>   "Vlade's the key to that team," he said, "as to whether he can
stand up to Shaquille and hold the fort."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Several Lakers noted Doug Christie's admission in the Sacramento
Bee that he was "scared to death" during Game 7 of the Western
Conference finals, a frame of mind that led in part to a late
airball.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess being honest about it is the best policy," Jackson said
kindly.</TE>
<TE>   Other Lakers, less kind, said they'd found their fourth-quarter
target.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal will have his surgically repaired toe examined today by Dr.
Robert Mohr, who performed the surgery Sept. 11.... The Lakers open
their exhibition season Tuesday against the Clippers in Bakersfield.</TE>

Feature Handicap, a Grade III at 350 yards.</LD>
<LD>   One Fast Cartel and Sneaky Flyer have won two in a row, but 2-1
morning-line favorite Ib Snow has gone them one better.</LD>

<HD>F1 Appears to Be Priority One for Gurney</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All American Racers team owner Dan Gurney hasn't been in the
Championship Auto Racing Teams series since 1999, but he may return
to big-time racing in a big way, by leaping back into Formula One.</LD>
<LD>   Gurney, who dazzled crowds in the 1960s while driving to seven
Formula One victories--four in World Championship events--said at
last week's U.S. Grand Prix that the machinations are in place for an
American F1 team to be on the grid five months from now at the
Australian Grand Prix on March 9, 2003.</LD>
<LD>   Gurney, 71, would use a Ford Cosworth powerplant, and his team
would build its own chassis, though assets of an existing team could
be acquired and raced in the interim.</LD>
<TE>   "The experts we would work with say yes, we can build a chassis,"
said Gurney, whose Eagle has been a racing fixture. "Other experts
say no. It depends on whose experts are right. It could be built at
AAR [in Santa Ana], or it could be that some of it would be built
here and some elsewhere. We have the capability.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a deal with Cosworth, but they would like us to be
a customer and they have the capacity to service a two-driver team
that we would campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Gurney will be the racing brains behind a partnership with Bob
Balachowski and Les Olsen. They have been researching this for two
years. Gurney was contacted nine months ago. They should know within
about two weeks if they will have financing.</TE>
<TE>   "If we do start, we want to be fully prepared and not worry about
the funding for the first two or three years, and if we can't do
that, we just won't," Gurney said. "We have a designer and a
technical director in mind who are ready to stand on the gas when we
put the package together."</TE>
<TE>   Gurney is considering only American drivers, including Bryan
Herta, for whom Gurney tried to put together a Ford-powered CART team
in 2000. Another candidate could be Gurney's son, Alex Gurney, a
product of Toyota Atlantic and British F-3 series.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a terrific opportunity, and has been a dream to many
people," Gurney said. "I honestly believe the first American outfit
that actually does it will have a huge advantage.... A lot of people
think this is a joke, but it isn't."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR has implemented rules in which drivers can be required by
infield medical doctors to undergo CT scans to detect suspected
concussions; drivers with concussions must then receive medical
clearance to return to racing.</TE>
<TE>   CART and the Indy Racing League have similar rules already in
place.</TE>
<TE>   Call it the Dale Earnhardt Jr. Rule. He disclosed last week that
he suffered a concussion April 28 in a crash at California Speedway
and drove several races while impaired. Earnhardt said he was not a
threat to himself or others, but at the same time blamed the
concussion for his subpar season. Obviously he wasn't thinking
clearly.</TE>
<TE>   If he is unable to maintain focus for 3 1/2 hours while driving a
car 185 mph, he's not only endangering drivers, but those on pit road
and in the stands. He was lucky.</TE>
<TE>   Earnhardt joked that even at 80%, he was better than half his
competitors. He's wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Through 29 races, only 12 drivers have had performances drop off
from 2001 more than Earnhardt. In the six races before his
concussion, Earnhardt finished in the top eight five times, the
exception a crash that left him 42nd. He has finished in the top
eight only four times in 19 races since.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, Gil de Ferran, trying to win his third consecutive
championship, was kept out of the final race of the IRL season
because he suffered a concussion. De Ferran finished third in the
championship and had no choice in the matter.</TE>

<TE>   Motocross</TE>
<TE>   The World Cup of Motocross took place last weekend, only nine days
after it was conceived. It was a testament to Glen Helen Raceway
President Bud Feldcamp, Vintage Iron owner Rick Doughty, and U.S.
team captain Roger DeCoster. They created the event after the
Motocross des Nations, scheduled last weekend for Competition Park in
San Jacinto, was postponed until Oct. 19-20 in Bellpuig, Spain.</TE>
<TE>   About 10,000 showed up at Glen Helen Raceway to see the Australian
contingent of Chad Reed, Michael Byrne and Craig Anderson claim the
title, ahead of Team USA's Tim Ferry, Sean Hamblin and Kyle Lewis.
Points were awarded to each country's top two finishers in each of
three 20-minute motos, and points were accumulated by finish.
Australia scored 20, the U.S. 24, and Canada finished a distant third
with 60.</TE>

<TE>   Irwindale</TE>
<TE>   Last week's Super Late Model season finale was rained out, so it
will be part of the show Saturday at Irwindale Speedway. Rip Michels
of Mission Hills has already clinched the title. Also on the card:
Tom Landreth of Alta Loma and Ricky Waldman of Yorba Linda are tied
with 490 points in the Legends division; seven drivers can still win
the Ultra Wheels Super Trucks title, where Carson Woods has 310
points, Rich Geisler has 304 and Jim McGill 302; Michael May of
Huntington Beach has clinched the title in West Coast Pro Trucks; and
Terry Limberopoulos of Bellflower, the Modified 4 champion, leads the
field in a 50-lap enduro.</TE>

<KH>Ross Newhan ON BASEBALL</KH>
<HD>Angels' Offense Playing Its Part</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It was on the eve of the division series between the Angels and
Yankees that New York Manager Joe Torre said the true profile of his
2002 team can be found on the mound and not in the batter's box.</LD>
<LD>   The Yankees may have occasionally awakened echoes of the Bronx
Bombers while leading the American League in runs and finishing
second in home runs, but Torre said, "I'd like to think the profile
of this team is pitching."</LD>
<LD>   He would add, "This is the best staff I've ever had."</LD>
<TE>   No one will dispute the quantity and quality of a staff that can
afford to put Jeff Weaver and Orlando Hernandez in the bullpen and
not include Sterling Hitchcock on the division series roster, but at
this point of a series that is tied, 1-1, and which they probably
should lead, 2-0, Angel hitters are pretty much disfiguring that
Yankee profile.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, to the Angels, it's not only hitting.</TE>
<TE>   It's what bench coach Joe Maddon calls "playing offense," and it
goes back to spring training when Maddon and hitting coach Mickey
Hatcher stressed it, charted it and watched it materialize as even
the big hitters such as Garret Anderson, Troy Glaus and Tim Salmon
made the effort to embrace it, which left colleagues with no choice
but to join them.</TE>
<TE>   "Now," said Darin Erstad, referring to the umbrella of situational
hitting, working the count, advancing runners, laying down bunts,
going from first to third whenever possible and stealing bases, "it's
like we don't even think about it. It feeds on itself. Everybody in
the lineup does it."</TE>
<TE>   In the House of Horrors that can be Yankee Stadium, in games
started by Roger Clemens, a six-time Cy Young Award winner, and Andy
Pettitte, third in postseason wins and 9-1 in his previous 11 starts,
everybody was doing it, indeed.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels collected 29 hits, batting an outrageous .372.</TE>
<TE>   They scored 13 runs, stole three bases, drew four walks, forced
Clemens and Pettitte to throw 179 pitches in 8 2/3 innings and also
demonstrated situational hitting doesn't have to be restricted to
hitting behind the runner.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels slugged six home runs, three by Glaus.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a meeting with the hitters before the first game there,"
Hatcher said, "and I told them, 'You've got to stay aggressive,
you've got to continue to put your game on the field.' I told them
the Yankees were starting with Clemens for one reason and that was to
try and intimidate us but that we've got to do the intimidating like
we have all year. They went out and did a great job of it."</TE>
<TE>   Put another way by Manager Mike Scioscia: "We have to bring our
style of play whether it's spring training or a World Series game. It
was a big step to take our game into an atmosphere as great as New
York."</TE>
<TE>   It is said in baseball that momentum is only as good as the next
day's pitcher. If the Angels are going to sustain their game amid the
pressure of the playoffs they will have to overcome another challenge
tonight in Mike Mussina, another key piece of the Yankee profile.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, however, the Angels have carried the lessons of
spring across 164 games, winning 100. They can't be expected to get
17 hits in every one, as they did in Game 2 Wednesday night, but they
did lead the league in hits and team batting, they did finish third
in stolen bases and fourth in on-base percentage and they did
outscore opponents by 207 runs despite finishing 10th in home runs.
They also struck out less than any major league team, possibly the
best measure of their improved discipline.</TE>
<TE>   In the two New York games, the Angels had baserunners in 14 of the
18 innings and scored in nine.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't always get it done," said Maddon, referring to the
situational demands that accompany most at-bats, "but the intent has
been there. The awareness has been fantastic."</TE>
<TE>   Said Hatcher: "What we told them in the spring is that a lot of
them may think they're being successful if they hit .300, but that's
not being a winner. There are three stats that are important: runs,
runs batted in and on-base percentage. I said to guys like Glaus and
Salmon, 'You guys may not feel you have an approach [that coincides
with the concept we're discussing] but we're going to make an
approach. We're going to take these [spring] games seriously. They
may not mean anything, but mentally they do when the season starts.'
"</TE>
<TE>   The one season is over and it's two games into the new season and
even shortstop Derek Jeter admitted the Yankees are getting a little
edgy with the tenacity and discipline of Angel hitters, who struck
out about 350 times less than the Yankees. "You have to ask the
pitchers how they feel, but on defense it's pretty frustrating
because even when our pitchers have made some quality pitches the
first two games, they don't swing at them or they foul them off,"
Jeter said. "And, you know, that's what you need to do at this time
of the year, put the ball in play, and that's definitely what they've
been doing."</TE>
<TE>   Trying to gauge whether 29 hits worth translates totally or in
part to good Angel at-bats or poor Yankee pitching is difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Torre suggested it was a combination of the two, saying that
neither Clemens nor Pettitte had bad stuff but couldn't locate it
consistently and couldn't put hitters away when they had the count in
their favor. Has he seen anything from the Angel offense he didn't
expect?</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately no," he said with a smile. "What's going on right
now is they're playing the way they expect to play, the way Mike
Scioscia expects them to play. You always look for something when
you're getting scouting reports on another team that somebody isn't
at the top of their game, but right now [some Angel] may have a bad
at-bat, but they come right back.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at Garret Anderson. He had a couple--I don't want to say
weak--at-bats [in Wednesday night's game], but bad at-bats for him,
then bang, home run [to tie the score in the eighth inning]. They're
all playing well right now, they all know what they have to do, and
that's a credit to Mike Scioscia."</TE>
<TE>   It also has to be called a credit to the concept of "playing
offense" and the way the Angels have adapted to it.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew we couldn't rely on home runs and expect to win," Erstad
said. "We have to scratch and crawl.</TE>
<TE>   "People say we're playing over our head, but look at the guys who
played regularly in the past and there's nobody who had a career
year, who did or is doing anything he hasn't done before. We're
playing the way we're capable of playing."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, by now, would seem to have established the accuracy of
that profile.</TE>

<HD>IOC Urged to Make Major Changes</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Report says committee lacks focus on its primary
goal of having top-notch Games. The hiring of chief operating officer
to oversee management is encouraged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The International Olympic Committee too often loses sight of its core
business--to put on first-rate Olympic Games--and should implement
fundamental management and strategic changes, an IOC-commissioned
report concludes. The report notes distractions, a "dysfunctional"
bureaucracy, poor staff morale and "no real focus on what matters."</LD>
<LD>   The report, one of a series of far-reaching IOC-chartered audits
now underway, recommends that the IOC create a new post, chief
operating officer, with the idea that Games management ought to be
centralized in a single accountable executive. No such position now
exists.</LD>
<LD>   The findings were based on a study by a team overseen by Fraser
Bullock, CEO of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. It was
recommended that the IOC implement wholesale changes in what is
called a "coordination commission"--an IOC task force charged with
overseeing a local organizing committee's progress toward putting on
the Games. The report says the CoComs, as they are known in IOC
parlance, are typically weak and ineffective.</LD>
<TE>   The study, many details of which were recently reviewed by The
Times, is a key piece in a wide-ranging mix of reforms up for
consideration under Jacques Rogge, the Belgian who last July was
elected the IOC's eighth president.</TE>
<TE>   At issue are fundamental organizational philosophies--because a
smartly run Games ramps up the economic engine that drives the IOC
and, by extension, the Olympic movement worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   The movement is now a $1-billion-per-year operation.</TE>
<TE>   Coming off the Salt Lake Winter Games last February, which were
seen as a logistical success, and looking forward to the Athens
Summer Games in 2004, Rogge said, "We have a two-year window of
opportunity to have a look at the organization."</TE>
<TE>   Bullock declined to confirm details of the study. He acknowledged
only that it was done.</TE>
<TE>   The report frames a central tension that has long bedeviled the
IOC: Is it in business merely to stage the Games? Or are the Games
solely the means to an end--that is, is it the IOC's mission to
advance the cause of peace and goodwill through sport, with the Games
as a worthy showcase but the essential work elsewhere?</TE>
<TE>   The report takes no position on what the IOC ought to do with the
ancillary work. It says quite clearly, however, that the Games--and
meaningful support for the local organizing committees that actually
stage the Games--ought to be an unquestioned priority No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   A telling quote from one interview cited in the report says
there's "not enough support to [organizing committees]--we need to
put the cathedral back in the middle of the square."</TE>
<TE>   The IOC staff, based at IOC headquarters in Lausanne,
Switzerland--many with years of experience in the Olympic
movement--is uniquely positioned to monitor Games preparation, the
report says.</TE>
<TE>   But, the report makes plain, too many staffers don't know or,
worse, don't care what their colleagues are doing.</TE>
<TE>   "Our ideas are not solicited nor considered relevant," one said.
Another--all the quotes in the report are anonymous--said, "I have no
understanding of what other areas do." Another said, "There is
secrecy over all issues." One staffer said, "Career progression and
salary growth is nonexistent, with management embarrassed to even
discuss it." Morale is "at an all-time low."</TE>
<TE>   Under the IOC's current structure, a director general, Francois
Carrard, oversees the Lausanne-based staff. The report is not
critical of Carrard. It says, though, that no one in Lausanne is
ultimately on the line for ensuring successful Games--thus the
recommendation for a chief operating officer.</TE>
<TE>   Rogge, stressing that he was not confirming or denying details in
the report but speaking in general about the IOC's organizational
chart, said, "If you ask me whether a chief operating officer would
be a great change at the IOC, my idea is no. We are working with a
professional staff."</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, the oversight role falls to the coordination
commissions, which typically make two visits per year to a Games
city. The commissions are dominated by IOC members--all of them
volunteers, some of them with vast experience in Games preparation,
others with marginal or no experience.</TE>
<TE>   "Seldom in my life have I been reviewed by those with so little a
capability to do so," the report quotes one of those interviewed as
saying.</TE>
<TE>   The political obstacle in changing the current system is easy to
grasp--as a consequence of the corruption scandal that erupted in
late 1998 over Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Games, IOC
members can no longer visit cities bidding for the Games, leaving the
commissions as one of the few high-mileage perks still available.</TE>
<TE>   Besides serving as chair of the Sydney 2000 coordinating
commission, Rogge also headed the Athens 2004 commission until his
election as IOC president. He said, "A CoCom is a way to force [local
organizers] to move forward. How many times in Australia and Greece
have we seen that the fact that the CoCom is coming makes the
organizers all of a sudden accelerate by the next visit? It's a bit
of a boost effect."</TE>
<TE>   Besides Bullock's report, the IOC this summer commissioned several
other business-related studies--to look at issues involving
technology, human resources, tax and legal affairs, the museum,
marketing and information management.</TE>
<TE>   In all, these seven audits will cost the IOC about $350,000.
Bullock's was done free.</TE>

<LD>Michele Redman shot a seven-under-par 65 Thursday at the Samsung
World Championship at Vallejo, Calif., and held a one-shot lead over
Annika Sorenstam, who had her sixth hole in one as a professional.</LD>
<LD>   Redman has two LPGA Tour victories, the last at the 2000 First
Union Betsy King Classic. She has tied for second twice this season,
at the Kellogg-Keebler in June and Canadian Women's in August.</LD>
<LD>   Sorenstam's 38 career wins include eight this year and the world's
No. 1 player tied Redman for the lead with one swing of her five-iron
at the 185-yard 17th at Hiddenbrooke Golf Club.</LD>
<TE>   Sorenstam hit her second shot into the water at the closing
497-yard par-five and settled for a bogey that dropped her to 66.</TE>
<TE>   Grace Park was third with a 67. *</TE>
<TE>   David Duval shot a seven-under 64--his best round of the
season--and shared a two-stroke lead with Hidemichi Tanaka after the
first round of the Michelob Championship at Williamsburg, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Tanaka birdied three of the last four holes for his 64. He missed
a right-to-left, 11-foot birdie putt on the par-four 18th.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Hoch was at 66 along with Loren Roberts, Corey Pavin, Bart
Bryant and Jose Coceres.</TE>

<HD>Broncos' O'Neal Must Pay for His Bump</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Denver cornerback Deltha O'Neal was fined $15,000 Thursday for
bumping an official during the Broncos' game Monday night against the
Baltimore Ravens.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal was ejected in the second quarter of the 34-23 loss on
Monday night after he ran into head linesman Tom Stabile. O'Neal was
arguing a pass interference call when he ran over to Stabile and
bumped him with his chest.</LD>
<LD>   NFL spokesman Steve Alic said the amount of the fine was in line
with the severity of the infraction.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Dave Wohlabaugh of the Cleveland Browns may return to the
starting lineup Sunday night against the Ravens after sitting out the
last three games with a broken right hand.</TE>
<TE>   Wohlabaugh has been out since injuring the hand during practice
Sept. 11. He had screws inserted and still wears a cast.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a real good possibility that Wohlabaugh is going to
start," Brown Coach Butch Davis said. "We've given him a significant
amount of snaps."</TE>
<TE>   Wohlabaugh has practiced snapping left-handed, Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   While Wohlabaugh was out, right guard Shaun O'Hara shifted to
center. Second-year guard Paul Zukauskas has started the past three
games in O'Hara's spot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Heisman Trophy winner Eric Crouch, who quit the St. Louis Rams
three weeks ago, said he would consider returning to professional
football if he can play quarterback. The Rams drafted the former
Nebraska quarterback as a wide receiver.</TE>
<TE>   "If I play again I'd definitely say it would be as a quarterback,"
Crouch said. "My whole life I've been a quarterback. I've molded
myself that way. My best football is when the ball's in my hands and
I have some control over what happens."</TE>
<TE>   Couch left the Rams after playing in only one preseason game and
seeing no regular-season action.</TE>
<TE>   He said his decision was based primarily on lingering injuries,
not because he was turned into a wide receiver.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Chargers put cornerback Tay Cody, who has a broken
big toe, on injured reserve and signed rookie cornerback Kevin House
from the New Orleans Saints' practice squad.</TE>
<TE>   Cody, a second-year pro, was hurt while covering the opening
kickoff of Sunday's 21-14 win over New England.</TE>
<TE>   House, a rookie free agent from South Carolina, is the son of
former NFL wide receiver Kevin House Sr., who played 10 years with
Tampa Bay and the Los Angeles Rams.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK GIANTS at DALLAS</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   TV: Channel 11.</LD>
<TE>   The line: Pick.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Three yards and a cloud of must.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Remember the Giants' between-the-tackles,
control-the-football running game? Remember Emmitt Smith? Long-gone
days. It has made for painful viewing, especially if you've been
watching Smith's Bearcrawl to History, also known as his (prolonged)
pursuit of Walter Payton's rushing record. Smith is taking it one
excruciating footstep at a time, averaging 59 yards a game, still 304
shy. At his current pace, Smith won't get there until mid-November.
Quick quiz: Which happens first, Smith breaks the record or Jim
Fassel lets Kerry Collins throw another sideline pass just before
halftime?</TE>

Inches"</TE>

<TE>   OAKLAND at BUFFALO</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Oakland by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Not Washed Up After All Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Preseason scouting report on this one: Why bother? Raiders
were too old, Jon Gruden was gone, Rich Gannon can't keep it up,
Jerry Rice can't keep up--warning: backslide ahead. Bills were 3-13
in 2001, Drew Bledsoe couldn't keep his job in New England, Bills
can't protect Bledsoe--AFC East basement, here they come. One month
later, we are older and so much wiser, equipped with calculator to
keep track of the footballs flying over Buffalo, aggregate passing
yards, points and total minutes played (Buffalo played three overtime
games in September, a league record). Old-time AFL football!</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Bills Defeat Raiders When Pigskins Fly"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TAMPA BAY at ATLANTA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Tampa Bay by 1.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Slapped in face, Warrick Dunn prepares to slap back.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Tampa Bay Coach Jon Gruden calls it the harsh reality of
salary-cap economics. Warrick Dunn calls it a slap in the face.
Either way, Dunn no longer plays for Tampa Bay, which is averaging
only 77.5 yards rushing per game without the diminutive running back.
With him, Atlanta is averaging nearly twice as many: 148.3. As the
first bitter reunion nears, Dunn told the Tampa Tribune, "They should
have kept me. When I made a decision, it was easy because they didn't
come close. It hurt.... I'll go on national TV and say this was a
slap in the face." Dunn. Gruden. It could get intense.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Bucs Become Un-Dunn in Dome"</TE>

<TE>   WASHINGTON at TENNESSEE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Tennessee by 5.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Are you sitting down? Spurrier just benched his
quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: At least Shane Matthews and Danny Wuerffel knew what they
were getting into. They played for Steve Spurrier at the University
of Florida, so they know the drill--which is to say that quarterbacks
in Spurrier's system are as disposable as sideline Gatorade cups.
Recyclable too. Matthews started Spurrier's Redskin debut, won the
game and was named NFC offensive player of the week. Then he didn't
start the next week. Or the week after that. Given two weeks to think
about it, Spurrier has decided to go with either Wuerffel or rookie
Patrick Ramsey. Byes are dangerous when you play for Spurrier.</TE>

<TE>   CINCINNATI at INDIANAPOLIS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Indianapolis by 13.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Kitna demands an end to Bengals' revolving door at
quarterback. That'll teach him.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Jon Kitna wasn't necessarily talking about himself when he
said Bengal Coach Dick LeBeau needed to pick one quarterback and
stick with him, charging that LeBeau had "created a monster" with his
Dial-An-Interception quarterback shuttle system. In fact, Kitna even
suggested Akili Smith be given the job for the rest of the season.
LeBeau wouldn't go that far, however, and he does read the
newspapers. So that will be Kitna and his big mouth lining up over
center against the Colts, who need a win badly.</TE>

Frerotte Don't Say a Word"</TE>

<TE>   NEW ENGLAND at MIAMI</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Miami by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Repeat after us: Last week never happened.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: What happens when two undefeated AFC East rivals get caught
looking ahead at the same time? San Diego 21, New England 14. And
Kansas City 48, Miami 30. At least the pressure's off. So too is much
of the luster, with both defensive coordinators suddenly staring at
game film and shaking their heads in stunned silence. What happened
to the Dolphins' pass defense? Five touchdown passes by Trent Green?
What happened to the Patriots' run defense? LaDainian Tomlinson plows
through for 217 yards? What happens when Tom Brady and Ricky Williams
are turned loose on the same field?</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Patriots Win on Blocked Field Goal; Stuff
Happens"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PITTSBURGH at NEW ORLEANS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New Orleans by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: The Xtreme lives!</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Kordell Stewart, who ended the 2001 season only a few votes
removed from the league most-valuable-player award, begins the fifth
week of the 2002 season one XFL veteran removed from the starting
lineup. Tommy Maddox, ex-XFLer, pride of the erstwhile L.A. Xtreme,
replaces Stewart as the Steelers' quarterback because the Steelers
can't run the ball anymore. That's not necessarily Stewart's fault,
although Stewart did have something to do with the 15 interceptions
he has thrown in Pittsburgh's last 15 games. Stewart's take on
Steeler Coach Bill Cowher right about now: He Hate Me.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Maddox: They Intercept Me"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ARIZONA at CAROLINA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Carolina by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Come back, Shayne!</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Somewhat amazingly, Shayne Graham will be back to kick field
goals and extra points for the Panthers, one week after missing a
field goal not much longer than an extra point in the final seconds
of a 17-14 loss at Green Bay. For the record, Graham was wide from 24
yards, dropping the Panthers to 3-1 and leaving Carolina Coach John
Fox doubled over on the sideline, apparently in severe stomach pain
or looking for a lost contact lens. Meanwhile, Arizona's Bill
Gramatica wonders if he'll have anything to kick at all, with first-
and second-string running backs Thomas Jones and Marcel Shipp both
hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Panthers Kick a Bad Team When They're Down"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KANSAS CITY at NEW YORK JETS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Kansas City by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: From Joe Willie to Vinny to Chad.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Mired in their worst offensive slump since they were known
as the New York Titans, the Jets (outscored, 102-13, in their last
three games) have decided they need someone other than Vinny
Testaverde at quarterback. They quickly ruled out punter Matt Turk,
having been unimpressed by his panicked two-handed chest pass to
Jacksonville's Donovan Darius last Sunday. That leaves Chad
Pennington, long presumed to be the Jets' future, at least until they
draft someone else. Pennington picked a bad spot for his first NFL
start. Kansas City beat Miami by 18 a week after Miami beat the Jets
by 27.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Holmes, Green Gang Up on Gang Green"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PHILADELPHIA at JACKSONVILLE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Philadelphia by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Analyze this.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The Jaguars are off to a surprising 2-1 start and Coach Tom
Coughlin, somewhat less miserable these days, has attributed some of
the success to the two sports psychologists who have been working
with the team. (Yes, guys who play for Tom Coughlin are now in
therapy. Supply your own punch lines.) Here's something to haunt
Jacksonville dreams: The Eagles are averaging 35 points a game, have
beaten their last three opponents by an average of 26.3 points and
are looking as if they can hold up their end in all those preseason
predictions of an all-Pennsylvania Super Bowl. Shame about
Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Doc: Jags Might Need Years to Recover From
This"</TE>

<TE>   ST. LOUIS at SAN FRANCISCO</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 11.</TE>
<TE>   The line: San Francisco by 7.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: The streak ends here.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: San Francisco is 0-6 against St. Louis since 1998 and the
thumbnail reason why: Jeff Garcia couldn't match Kurt Warner
touchdown pass for touchdown pass. That part of the equation became
moot last Sunday when Warner broke the little finger on his throwing
hand. Now the matchup is Garcia against Jamie Martin, career backup
about to make his second NFL start amid somewhat stressful
circumstances. The 49ers are at home, the Rams are 0-4, the 49ers
have been waiting for this day for years. Never fails in this league:
What goes around always comes around. Possible exception: Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "49ers 0-6 No More Against 0-5 Rams"</TE>
<TE>   * SAN DIEGO at DENVER</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Denver by 5.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: The wild, wild card West.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: There are no more breathers in the AFC West, now that
Seattle has bailed and Marty Schottenheimer is gradually thawing
hardened hearts in San Diego, where the once-hated chief Chief is now
4-0 with the no-longer-slumbering Chargers. It's only the first
Sunday in October, but this Charger-Bronco clash has playoff
implications, as they say, the winner getting a leg up in the
wild-card race (assuming mandatory retirement age doesn't gut the
Raider roster before Christmas). For Denver, that's a key issue:
Brian Griese getting his leg up and over his pet dog and not tripping
again before kickoff.</TE>

<TE>   BALTIMORE at CLEVELAND</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 5:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Cleveland by 6 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Art Modell for the Hall of Fame? Can we have a shout
from the Dawg Pound?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Canton is not too far from Cleveland, but Baltimore is. Can
Modell, among this year's 14 nominees for the Hall of Fame, get there
from here? Raven Coach Brian Billick thinks so and has been stumping
for his candidacy: "Let the right thing happen." Billick would say
that. Modell was smart enough to hire Billick before the 1999 season;
why shouldn't they start clearing space for a bust next to George
Halas? Cleveland residents can probably give Billick a dissenting
opinion or two. And 73,300 of them most likely will.</TE>

<TE>   Kickoff: Monday, 6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Chicago by 1.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Are you ready for a new America's Team?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: According to a new Harris Poll, the Packers have replaced
the Cowboys as America's favorite NFL team, indicating a) Brett Favre
is popular in fantasy football leagues; b) Cheeseheads might have
been stuffing the ballot box; and/or c) Jerry Jones was right about
the drag effect Quincy Carter was having on his team. How this
translates into Nielsen ratings, ABC is about to find out. Meanwhile,
the Bears have lost their last two games, along with four defensive
starters, prompting Harris to cancel its upcoming poll: Who is
America's Fluke?</TE>

<LD>The winds of change blew hard this week. Snow fell for the first time
this season in the Eastern Sierra. It didn't stick, but it was enough
to let campers and fishermen know that, while six weeks are left in
the fishing season, it's nearing time to pack up and head home.</LD>
<LD>   "Business is dropping fast," says Mike Herndon, a concession clerk
at Lake Mary near Mammoth Lakes. "There are mostly just hard-core
locals out on the lake now. This is their time."</LD>
<LD>   That's more true during the week than during the weekends, as fall
can be highly productive for late-season anglers venturing up from
the Southland. But it's becoming more true by the week, whether at
Lake Mary or nearby lakes Mamie and George; at Convict Lake south of
Mammoth or at Twin Lakes near Bridgeport.</LD>
<TE>   At Convict Lake Resort, owner David DeSurra has purchased the last
of Tim Alpers' seasonal allotment of trophy-sized rainbow trout in
hopes of luring more people to one of the true jewels of the region.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to encourage people to get their priorities straight
and quit their jobs and come up and go fishing," he says with a
laugh.</TE>
<TE>   As for the snow that fell all day Tuesday, there is none left on
the shore but Mt. Morrison, which towers over the lake, is sporting a
fresh layer of white.</TE>

<TE>   In the Mammoth Lakes area, the shuttle to Reds Meadow has stopped
running, although the road remains open.</TE>
<TE>   At Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, whose upper slopes are no longer
entirely barren, the mountain bike park has closed and scenic gondola
rides have ceased as the staff prepares for a different kind of

<TE>   End of the Trail</TE>
<TE>   Half Dome enthusiasts can mark Oct. 14 as the last day they can
take a hike up California's most popular mass of granite. Yosemite
National Park has announced Oct. 15 as the day it will bring down the
cables linking the trail to the summit.</TE>
<TE>   They'll be put back up next spring.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Still Going Strong</TE>
<TE>   The same weather front that delivered snow to the Eastern Sierra
sent high winds raking over the offshore tuna grounds, causing some
sportfishing boats to turn back but doing nothing to drive away the
albacore.</TE>
<TE>   "Those that stayed out did really well," John Yamate, manager of
Seaforth Sportfishing in San Diego, said of the early-week
disturbance. "This has just been a terrific albacore season."</TE>
<TE>   The longfin tuna are averaging 15-25 pounds and biting mainly in
an area 80-90 miles southwest of Point Loma. And with conditions
holding steady, landing operators are probably right when they say
they'll run out of fishermen before they run out of fish.</TE>
<TE>   How good has the season been? The San Diego fleet last Saturday
set a record with a cumulative tally of 123,500 albacore. The
previous high was 122,084 in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   One reason albacore fishing has been so good in recent years is a
reduction of gill-net fishing by Asian fleets for squid in the North
Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   "It's generally accepted that the removal of that [incidental]
mortality on juvenile albacore in the North Pacific has allowed the
species to recover," said Steve Crooke, a Department of Fish and Game
biologist and avid albacore angler. "What's tremendous was the
year-class of albacore we had last year, the four- to six-pounders.
Those are the 12- to 15-pound fish we're catching now. I can't wait
till next year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Northern Exposure</TE>
<TE>   Late summer and fall typically mark the beginning of albacore
season off the Central California coast. And the season is
progressing as well as could be expected.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually we start by catching the little bullets, the
football-sized fish at 8-12 pounds," said Joe Romley, a spokesman for
Virg's Landing in Morro Bay. "Then we get the 18- to 20-pounders and
now the fish are averaging 22-26 pounds, but they're going to get
much bigger before the season ends."</TE>
<TE>   Virg's last week posted some phenomenal scores: 595 fish for 51
anglers one day, and 555 for 41 the next. The biggest fish was a
62-pounder caught aboard the Fiesta.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the big wind, which didn't let up until Wednesday. The
boats were back in business Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Confusion in Cabo</TE>
<TE>   Fall is peak season in Cabo San Lucas but not everyone is
celebrating. The resort city at Baja California's tip is the site of
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit finale Oct. 20-28, and
the grand affair has the whole town, as one hotelier put it, "in a
state of confusion."</TE>
<TE>   Hotel owners months ago were asked to set aside approximately
8,000 rooms for dignitaries, their entourages and members of the
media, yet many have not received payment for the rooms or news of
who would be staying where. Fleet owners had hoped the international
influx would mean lots of sportfishing business but so far most of
the requests have been for free fishing trips.</TE>
<TE>   "That's pretty much the way things have been going. Nobody seems
to know what's going on," said Randy Lehr, director of operations for
the Hacienda Beach Resort.</TE>
<TE>   The Hacienda, one of the oldest and most reputable hotels at
Land's End, was asked to hold all of its rooms but this week
announced it was releasing 25% of them at a reduced rate of $99 per
night "so we'll have somebody in the hotel," Lehr said.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel Solmar, situated closest to Land's End on the Pacific side
of the peninsula, is releasing all of its rooms, as is the Mar de
Cortez in town. Several others, including the Melia, are releasing at
least some of their rooms.</TE>
<TE>   APEC organizers seem to be favoring the "hotel corridor" north of
town over Cabo proper, as some of those hotels are actually booked
with APEC participants.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, I've never seen anything like this before," Lehr
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As for the Fishing ...</TE>
<TE>   "It's hot," says Tracy Ehrenberg, owner of Pisces Sportfishing.
Anglers aboard her vessels have been encountering a little of
everything. A small group on the Tracy Ann, for example, caught and
released three sailfish and boated five tuna and two dorado on
Sunday. Blue marlin are increasingly making their presence known and
striped marlin are in the area as well.</TE>
<TE>   This is typical of October. What isn't is the unseasonably cool
weather. Mornings have been cool and the temperature has barely
reached 90 the last several days.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody is complaining about that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Keeping Score</TE>
<TE>   The numbers are in: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reports
that more than 34 million Americans fished, 13 million hunted and 66
million went afield to photograph, feed or simply observe wildlife
last year, spending more than $108 billion in their collective
pursuits.</TE>
<TE>   Of that amount, $28.1 billion was trip-related, $64.5 billion was
spent on equipment and $15.8 billion was spent on other items,
according to the annual survey.</TE>
<TE>   To lend some perspective, the USFWS says that hunters and
fishermen alone "could fill every NFL and major league baseball
stadium, as well as every NASCAR track, six times over."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps a more fitting comparison: "More Americans wake up to the
great outdoors than to the top 20 newspapers."</TE>

<HD>There's a Will, but No Willingham</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tyrone Willingham left Stanford so fast last Dec. 30 he forgot to
turn off the lights.</LD>
<LD>   That's what happens when the Notre Dame coaching job opens and the
football school, like that old poster of Uncle Sam, wants you.
Willingham left with papers on his desk and coffee in the pot.</LD>
<LD>   Stanford players found out Willingham was gone as the rest of us
did--on television.</LD>
<TE>   Willingham returned in mid-January for the Cardinal's postseason
banquet, but that didn't ease the hurt.</TE>
<TE>   You could hardly blame Willingham for jumping to Notre Dame, yet
some players still hold grudges and eagerly await Saturday's chance
to face their former coach when Stanford concludes its nonconference
schedule in South Bend, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal offensive guard Paul Weinacht said Oct. 5 was the only
game he had circled on his calendar.</TE>
<TE>   It remains unclear, however, whether the Cardinal is capable of
exacting revenge.</TE>
<TE>   It appears Stanford, through games of Sept. 28, needed Willingham
more than he needed it.</TE>
<TE>   The 9-3 squad Willingham left in Palo Alto has struggled under
first-year Coach Buddy Teevens, toting a ton of baggage and a 1-2
record into South Bend.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's 65-24 loss at Arizona State ranks as one of the worst
in school history, the Cardinal giving up 535 yards while committing
seven turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly helped them [Arizona State] every step of the way,"
Teevens said.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Teevens has not settled on a quarterback and has been
rotating junior Chris Lewis and freshman Kyle Matter, with marginal
success.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham, meanwhile, has taken the 5-6 team he inherited from
Bob Davie and transformed it into a top-10 contender at 4-0.</TE>
<TE>   The start almost mirrors what Willingham did when he took over at
Stanford in 1995, when he led a Cardinal team coming off consecutive
losing seasons to a 4-0-1 start.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Stanford at Notre Dame is not an ordinary game, as these
schools have ties that bind.</TE>
<TE>   Six former Stanford assistants followed Willingham to Notre Dame,
and Willingham recruited the majority of Stanford's current players.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the game, we will have emotions, and after the game we
will have emotions," Willingham said. "There will probably be a lot
of hugs and conversation. But at game time, I think they will be
fierce competitors, and I know that will be the mind-set I'll be in."</TE>
<TE>   Teevens is still trying to find himself in his first year and is,
oddly, the outsider in this football family reunion.</TE>
<TE>   He said he addressed the Willingham relationship with his players
"straight up" but reminded his players of an important fact.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not playing a coaching staff," Teevens said, "we're playing
a team."</TE>
<TE>   The good news for Stanford's 112th-ranked scoring defense is Notre
Dame's offense has been the team's weakness. It's doubtful the Irish
will be able to come close to scoring 65 points, especially if Notre
Dame has to start former walk-on Pat Dillingham at quarterback in
place of Carlyle Holiday, who is nursing an injury to his left
(non-throwing) shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   To be noted: Stanford has fared well in big games of late,
defeating the last three top-10 ranked schools it has faced. The
Cardinal beat No. 5 Texas in 2000 and last year beat No. 5 Oregon,
the Ducks' only loss last year, and No. 4 UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   The difference, of course, is that Tyrone Willingham led Stanford
to those upset wins, not Buddy Teevens.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pac Bits</TE>
<TE>   Six of the nation's top 14 passers are Pac-10 quarterbacks, led by
Arizona State's Andrew Walter, who leads with a 185.5 efficiency
rating. The other five are Washington's Cody Pickett (No. 5), Oregon
State's Derek Anderson (No. 9), Washington State's Jason Gesser (No.
10), Stanford's Kyle Matter (No. 12) and Oregon's Jason Fife (No. 14)</TE>
<TE>   Washington State's Gesser, despite a torn rib-cage muscle, threw
for 431 yards in last week's victory against California. "He doesn't
have a different pain threshold from normal people," Cougar Coach
Mike Price said of his quarterback. "No, he hurts. He's just tough.
He just sucks it up and says 'I'm going to do it anyway.' "</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Erickson is one of college football's most innovative
offensive minds, but the Oregon State coach isn't beyond poking fun
at himself. "I spend most of my time offensively," he said this week
when asked how he divides his time at practice. "I think that really
showed this week, obviously." Oregon State is coming off a 22-0 loss
to USC.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State (4-1) is the conference's surprise school, winning
four consecutive games after an opening loss at Nebraska. A victory
over North Carolina in Tempe on Saturday would give Arizona State its
best start since the 1996 squad that almost won the national
championship, but let's hold off on the comparisons. The 1996 team,
led by quarterback Jake Plummer, started 5-0, with three of those
victories coming against Washington, Nebraska (19-0) and Oregon. This
year's squad thus far has polished off Eastern Washington, Central
Florida, San Diego State and Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   There is no denying Arizona State's firepower, led by Walter, a
touted sophomore who has regained his starting spot after losing it
in spring practice to freshman Chad Christensen.</TE>
<TE>   "Andrew's playing great right now," Sun Devil Coach Dirk Koetter
said. "He was recruited here by the previous staff, supposedly the
savior of program. He struggled, they changed staffs, and there were
mechanical issues that needed to be cleaned up. He came a long way."</TE>
<TE>   Will this be the year? California plays at Washington looking to
end a 19-game losing streak against the Huskies. The Bears haven't
won since 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone thinks the team with the best offense will win this
year's conference title.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe when it all comes down to the end, you're going to have
to play good defense," Washington Coach Rick Neuheisel said. "Right
now, you'd have to say USC is doing that."</TE>
<TE>   USC leads the Pac-10 in scoring defense (11.8 points a game) and
in total defense (205 yards a game).</TE>

<HD>Success Has a Way of Kicking In at Notre Dame</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget about playing "The Star-Spangled Banner" before football games
involving Sherman Oaks Notre Dame High. Music from the "Twilight
Zone" would be a more appropriate pregame ritual.</LD>
<LD>   There's something strange, even weird, going on with the Knights
and their kickers.</LD>
<LD>   For 16 of the last 17 seasons, Notre Dame has produced a kicker or
punter who was named all-league or All-Southern Section.</LD>
<TE>   This season, senior kicker Mike Allen and sophomore punter Greg
Folk have made critical contributions to Notre Dame's 3-0 start.
Allen has made all four of his field-goal attempts, and Folk is
averaging 38.5 yards per punt.</TE>
<TE>   Both are younger brothers of former Notre Dame kickers. And for
those who love conspiracy theories, each has a younger brother in
eighth grade, attending the same school, enrolled in the same class.</TE>
<TE>   Tyler Allen and Erik Folk are also kickers and will arrive at
Notre Dame next season, an indication that the Knights' kicking
success shows no signs of waning. Even the backup kicker this season,
junior Sean Limahelu, has an uncle who kicked for San Diego State and
another uncle who kicked for USC.</TE>
<TE>   "It's 'Kicker University,' " said former Notre Dame kicker Chris
Sailer, who went on to become an All-American at UCLA and kick in the
Arena Football League.</TE>
<TE>   Sailer is largely responsible for establishing the standard of
excellence at Notre Dame. He was a Parade All-American in 1994, when
he made 22 of 28 field goals in leading the Knights to a Southern
Section championship. To score on the Knights, teams had to drive 80
yards or longer because of Sailer's many kickoffs and punts into the
end zone.</TE>
<TE>   Sailer has returned to serve as a roving kicking instructor for
Notre Dame and other schools, offering clinics, camps and individual
coaching.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Allen worked with Sailer over the summer and made remarkable
improvement.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen a high school kid more dedicated to kicking and
getting better," Sailer said.</TE>
<TE>   Allen kicked almost every day, even booting balls between trees at
a park in West Hills. He won the field-goal job from Folk, who spent
August playing soccer in England.</TE>
<TE>   Kickers past and present credit Coach Kevin Rooney's unyielding
focus on special teams as the major reason for the Knights' success.</TE>
<TE>   "No other school is close to putting in the extra attention he
gives to kickers and special teams," Sailer said.</TE>
<TE>   Added Rooney: "We think it's important. We try to recognize
kickers and make sure everyone knows how important they are."</TE>
<TE>   Rooney has made compromises with his kickers, many of whom started
out in soccer. He allows them to leave practice to fulfill club
soccer workouts, something other coaches refuse to do.</TE>
<TE>   Folk, who is the best soccer player at Notre Dame, said he'd
choose soccer if Rooney forced him to make a choice. But because he
can juggle his schedule, he's sticking with both sports for now. His
older brother, Nick, faced the same decision last season and accepted
a football scholarship to Arizona instead of playing soccer at
another school.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame's most renowned kicker besides Sailer was Brian
Greenfield, a 1987 graduate who punted for the University of
Pittsburgh and the Cleveland Browns.</TE>
<TE>   It takes a special personality, someone who can deal with
pressure, to be a successful kicker. Allen learned first-hand from
his brother, Ryan, about the highs and lows of the job.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan made 11 of 14 field goals for Notre Dame two years ago, but
he missed a 34-yard field goal as time expired in a Division IV
semifinal game against Manhattan Beach Mira Costa. Notre Dame lost in
overtime, 41-38.</TE>
<TE>   Mike was a sophomore, watching from the sideline.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw him miss it, I just looked at the floor, dropped my
head and felt bad for him," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He tried to speak with his brother a couple weeks later about the
kick.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me, 'Shut up,' and I haven't brought it up since," Mike
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan is a sophomore punter at Yale and still thinks about the
missed field goal that could have sent Notre Dame into the
championship game.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a low point," he said. "It was hard, but in the life of a
kicker, it's going to happen. Things aren't going to be perfect. It
taught me that failures come along and you have to meet them and move
on."</TE>
<TE>   Mike has embraced the demands of kicking.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of exciting to have pressure on you," he said. "The
team either loves you or hates you. I haven't been in a situation if
you make it, you win, and if you miss it, you lose."</TE>
<TE>   But he wants the chance.</TE>
<TE>   Similar to Newhall Hart with quarterbacks and Long Beach Poly with
defensive backs, Notre Dame has established itself as the school for
kickers.</TE>
<TE>   It looks as if the Allen and Folk families are going to supply
Notre Dame with kickers through 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Rooney, in his 23rd season as coach, doesn't mind. He'll have a
few more gray hairs by then, but the kicking game figures to be as
good as ever.</TE>

<KH>KING-DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Murray Mulling Last Cuts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With most of the core of his lineup pretty much set, Coach Andy
Murray will have a difficult job trimming his team's roster to 23
before the Kings' season opener against Phoenix Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "There's still a question mark on defense," said Murray, who will
open the season without injured defenseman Aaron Miller. "We're
trying to decide who the sixth and seventh guys are going to be."</LD>
<LD>   Captain Mattias Norstrom, Mathieu Schneider, Jaroslav Modry,
Lubomir Visnovsky and off-season pickup Chris McAlpine probably will
open the season as Murray's main players on the blue line. Jason
Holland, Andreas Lilja and Brad Norton are the players on the bubble.</LD>
<TE>   "It just gets tougher to make decisions at this stage," Murray
said. "A lot of things will play a factor. Can they sustain the same
level of play in practices? Are they intense all the time when they
play in games? How do they fit in with the group?</TE>
<TE>   "You're always watching but it's tough right now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another concern for Murray has been injuries to the King
enforcers.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Belanger, who began last season as the team's top enforcer,
has been sidelined because of a disk problem in his lower back. Ryan
Flinn, who stepped in for 10 games last season when Belanger was
injured, is out with the same injury, and rookie Kip Brennan was
assigned to Manchester of the American Hockey League on Thursday
along with forward Scott Barney.</TE>
<TE>   Belanger said he expects to return once the regular season starts.</TE>
<TE>   "I should feel 100% for the season," said Belanger, who sat out
most of the second half of last season because of a thumb injury.
"I've been injury-struck throughout my career but that's only to be
expected when you play four or five minutes a game. You're sitting on
the bench and then you try and go out there cold. You're a little
stiff and that's when injuries happen. But that's what you have to
deal with in the role that I play."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   McAlpine scored a power-play goal with 10 seconds left to lead the
Kings to a 2-1 exhibition victory over the Phoenix Coyotes at
Oklahoma City. Jaroslav Bednar scored the other goal for the Kings,
who improved to 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Based on how the Mighty Ducks have approached training camp under
first-year Coach Mike Babcock, they're determined to earn a
reputation as a difficult opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing is going to be free," said Babcock, whose team will play
its next-to-last exhibition game tonight against Phoenix at the
Arrowhead Pond.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be absolutely relentless.... We can't keep doing
things slow. We have to do things fast because that's our strength."</TE>
<TE>   To establish this mentality, Babcock has pushed his players to do
everything with a sense of urgency every time they are on the ice.
It's a coaching style that is starting to catch on with his players.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a real nice coach, who's really hyper," defenseman Ruslan
Salei said about Babcock, who brings his own personal energy to every
practice.</TE>
<TE>   "But you can see that he wants us to work hard and that's good for
us."</TE>
<TE>   Said veteran center Steve Rucchin, who skated on the No. 2 line
with Petr Sykora and Stanislav Chistov in practice Thursday: "He
definitely helps the enthusiasm level around here.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to practice like we play and if we do everything in
practice at a high tempo, it's just going to become second nature."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin, who missed large parts of the last two seasons because of
jaw and ankle injuries, said he's a better player than he was in
1996-97 when he played in a career-high 79 games and finished with 19
goals and 67 points.</TE>
<TE>   "The longer you are around in this league, you're just going to
get better," Rucchin said. "You pick up certain things and you get to
know what it takes to be at your best."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   According to Babcock, defenseman Pavel Trnka may not be available
for the start of the season because of a groin injury and may be put
on the injured list. Defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski left the practice
ice early Thursday because of tendinitis in his right knee but he's
expected to play tonight.</TE>

<LD>How does a marketing director promote a team that lacks a notable
star? Scott Mitchell of UCLA decided to focus on guys in the
trenches.</LD>
<LD>   "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" was taken, so Mitchell went with
billboards, pennants and direct-mail brochures featuring senior
tackle Mike Saffer.</LD>
<LD>   "We sat down in January and talked about the possibilities,"
Mitchell said. "The blue-collar Bruin approach with the line as the
strength of the team was the direction we wanted to go. And Saffer
was the individual that fit well."</LD>
<TE>   Marketing last season focused on a handful of seniors who had
developed strong name recognition--DeShaun Foster, Robert Thomas,
Marques Anderson and Ryan Nece.</TE>
<TE>   "It was clear some of the guys we hyped didn't perform up to
expectations," Mitchell said. "So this year we decided to take a team
approach."</TE>
<TE>   Cornerback Ricky Manning is the only individual besides Saffer
being promoted. Notably absent is senior quarterback Cory Paus, whose
two convictions for driving under the influence disqualified him.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed to be careful with that," Mitchell said. "Nobody is
rooting harder for Cory than [Coach Bob Toledo] and us, but the risk
wasn't worth it."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA spends about $200,000 a year on marketing the football team,
a sum that officials believe is recouped through additional ticket
sales.</TE>
<TE>   Although Saffer is questionable for Saturday's game against Oregon
State and could be out as long as three weeks because of a broken
rib, there are no plans to change the direction of marketing.</TE>
<TE>   "Those things take too much lead time to adjust because of an
injury," Mitchell said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The injury to Saffer, the right tackle, has caused uncertainty,
but not nearly as much as Oregon State is experiencing at left
tackle.</TE>
<TE>   The Beavers lost their two top left tackles--Brian Kilkenny
(broken leg) and backup Lee Davis (knee ligament)--the last two
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Left guard Mike Kuykendall, a senior who played tackle as a
freshman and sophomore, will move to left tackle and reserve David
Lose will start at guard. Freshman Jake Pratt and junior Isaac
Aaronson, a transfer from Cal State Northridge, will back up
Kuykendall.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Manning, a senior, looks forward to the Oregon State game more
than most because his cousin, Eric Manning, is an All-Pac-10
defensive tackle for the Beavers.</TE>
<TE>   Eric had 74 tackles--including six sacks--last season but is off
to a slower start this year. He has 10 tackles and has yet to make a
sack.</TE>
<TE>   The family connection apparently inspires Ricky.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year's game was one of the best of his career," Toledo said.
"He shut down whoever he covered."</TE>

<LD>USC's top-ranked women's volleyball team faces a major test tonight
against defending NCAA champion Stanford in a Pacific 10 Conference
match in Palo Alto.</LD>
<LD>   USC (10-0, 4-0 in conference) has lost only one game in earning
its No. 1 ranking by the American Volleyball Coaches Assn. and
Volleyball magazine. Fourth-ranked Stanford (12-1, 3-0) lost to
Florida on Sept. 14 but didn't have outside hitter Logan Tom, who
played on the silver-medal winning U.S. national team at the World
Championships.</LD>
<LD>   "We'll see what we can find out about our team," USC Coach Mick
Haley said. "They didn't have Logan for that Florida loss and I'm
sure they want to see where they are. It's kind of a fact-finding
mission for us."</LD>
<TE>   The Trojans won't have middle blocker Bibiana Candelas, who has
yet to be cleared to participate. Haley said the NCAA is checking on
the 6-foot-5 freshman's eligibility.Candelas played for Mexico at the
World Championships and arrived at USC on Sept. 9.</TE>

<TE>   Santa Clara, the defending NCAA women's soccer champion, visits
Southern California this weekend for games at UCLA and USC. The No.
3-ranked Bruins will host the 11th-ranked Broncos on Friday in the
first night game in school history at Drake Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Santa Clara sophomore forward Megan Kakadelas returns
to USC after being named Pac-10 freshman of the year for the Trojans
last season. Kakadelas, who transferred to Santa Clara last spring,
leads the Broncos in scoring with four goals and 12 points.</TE>

<TE>   UC Santa Barbara's women's volleyball team is ranked seventh, its
highest spot since the end of the 1999 season, after defeating
previously undefeated Long Beach State, 30-27, 30-26, 30-32, 15-30,
15-11, last week before 3,182 at the Pyramid. The Gauchos, led by
Danielle Bauer's 21 kills, are 13-0 and will be off to their best
start if they can defeated Utah State tonight.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Katherine Hull moved into the top spot in the Golfweek/Sagarin
rankings, becoming the first Pepperdine women's golfer to accomplish
that feat. The senior tied for individual medalist honors at the Dick
McGuire Invitational last week and was second at the NCAA Preview
tournament.... Rob Friend has scored in all seven soccer matches for
undefeated Santa Barbara (7-0) this season.</TE>

<HD>Backup Kicker Hurts Leg</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A routine practice ended on an uncertain note Thursday when backup
kicker David Davis was injured on the final play of the workout.</LD>
<LD>   Davis, a returning starter who was supplanted by Ryan Killeen last
week against Oregon State, was hit in the left leg--his kicking
leg--after attempting a 37-yard field goal. Davis crumpled to the
ground and stayed there for several minutes while trainers attended
to him before he limped to the locker room.</LD>
<LD>   "I just had this burning sensation going down my leg and I
couldn't really pick up my foot," said Davis, a senior who made 15 of
18 field goals last season but struggled in games this season against
Colorado and Kansas State. "They got out there and started moving it
around and I could feel it coming back a little bit better, but it's
still burning."</LD>
<TE>   X-rays were negative, but Davis said he aggravated a nerve and
also suffered a contusion on his knee. He is doubtful for Saturday's
Pacific 10 Conference game at No. 17 Washington State, so if Killeen
falters or is injured, punter Tom Malone  would be pressed into
service as USC's placekicker.</TE>
<TE>   Malone kicked 46- and 47-yard field goals last season at Lake
Elsinore Temescal Canyon High.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Pete Carroll is hopeful that Davis will be available. "It's
great to have an experienced guy who has kicked big kicks," Carroll
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman offensive lineman Fred Matua underwent arthroscopic
surgery on his right knee, almost guaranteeing that he will redshirt
this season.</TE>
<TE>   Matua was scheduled to start at right guard in the opener against
Auburn, but hurt his knee days before the game. He played as a
reserve against Auburn and Kansas State but sat out Sept. 14 against
Colorado and last week against Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Carroll said Matua would try to come back for
next week's game against California. However, that was before tests
revealed cartilage damage, Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive end Omar Nazel has not practiced all week because of a
sore shoulder, but he said he would start against Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said walk-on Jay Bottom and Doyal Butler would play if
Nazel can't.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The last time freshman receiver Mike Williams played before a
hostile crowd on the road, he dropped four passes and blamed himself
for the Trojans' loss at Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   As Williams prepared for Saturday's game at noisy Martin Stadium,
he said rowdy fans would not affect him.</TE>
<TE>   "The noise really didn't have an effect on me at K-State, it was
just a lack of focus," said Williams, who is nursing a sore right
calf.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Grant Mattos, who was scheduled to play after recovering
from an abdominal strain, is questionable because of a sprained
ankle.</TE>
