<HD>Till (His) Death Do They Part in Iran</HD>
<DH>Crime: The phenomenon of husband-killing, punishable by
death, is on the rise in the male-dominated society. Some point to
abuse, philandering as factors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALI AKBAR DAREINI</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEHRAN</DL>
<LD>Married at age 13 to a man 18 years her senior, Ferdows was the wife
that Iranian society expected her to be: obedient and silent, despite
the beatings and the humiliation.</LD>
<LD>   But after 30 years of marriage, she had had enough. She arranged
to have her husband, Hedayat, killed, authorities say.</LD>
<LD>   Ferdows, who has been convicted of murder and sentenced to death,
is one of at least 20 Tehran women accused of murdering their
husbands since February. Initially, the reports of the slayings were
largely unnoticed. That changed as the number rose and Iranians began
to see the killings as signs of social stress.</LD>
<TE>   "Husband-killing is a new phenomenon in Iran's male-dominated
society. It means economic hardships and social crises are reaching a
crisis point," sociologist Mohammad Ahmadi said.</TE>
<TE>   He cited a number of problems in Iranian society that lead to
frustration and desperation: forced marriages, philandering by
husbands, impotence, poverty and no healthy entertainment in a
country whose Islamic laws ban socializing between men and women who
are not closely related.</TE>
<TE>   Others blame restrictive divorce laws that leave women feeling
that murder is the only way out of a bad marriage.</TE>
<TE>   In Ferdows' case, she accused her husband of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "During 30 years of matrimonial life, Hedayat always beat me. He
was a doubter and skeptical of everything and didn't trust me. He had
made life hell for me," Ferdows told authorities, who have identified
her only by her first name.</TE>
<TE>   Ferdows paid a man the equivalent of $3,750 to stab Hedayat to
death three years ago, prosecutors said. The crime wasn't exposed
until February this year, when police found her husband's remains in
an abandoned building. She had told people that Hedayat abandoned
her.</TE>
<TE>   Ferdows and the hit man were convicted and sentenced at a closed
trial in April. Word of the outcome leaked out a few weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   The punishment for women who murder their husbands is death. Some
already have been convicted and executed. Others are on death row and
some are awaiting trial. They come from all social classes.</TE>
<TE>   "Divorce is the first solution for women to get rid of an
undesirable troubled life. But why did these women ignore this option
and resort to something that carries the death sentence?" asked the
monthly magazine Zanan, or Women.</TE>
<TE>   Iranian men can divorce almost at will, but a woman who wants a
divorce must go through a legal battle that can take as long as 20
years, lawyer Sara Irani said. Even then, she said, it might end with
the woman failing to dissolve the marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Under Iran's Islamic laws, a man can keep four spouses at one
time, a right not granted women.</TE>
<TE>   Even if a husband is having an affair, he can claim to have
undertaken a sigheh, or temporary marriage. It's a contract allowed
under Iranian law that allows a man and woman to be "married" for any
length of time they choose. Critics call legalized prostitution.</TE>
<TE>   Nor does a woman trapped in a violent marriage have much recourse
against her husband.</TE>
<TE>   "A woman has to bring four men witnesses confirming violence
against her by her husband," Irani said. "How is a woman in Iran
expected to keep four men in her bedroom to witness her husband
beating her?"</TE>
<TE>   Irani, who also writes about women's affairs, said that
husband-killing is the "outcome of humiliation and discrimination
against women," and that the recent surge in cases should pressure
the country's leaders to improve legal protection for women.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmadi, the sociologist, said that, in a country where there is
virtually no sex education, unhappy marriages and domestic violence
also can arise when husbands and wives don't know how to please each
other. "Many couples don't have enjoyable sex," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Abdosamad Khorramshahi, a lawyer, sees social changes contributing
to the killings.</TE>
<TE>   "Previously, we had a socially closed society. Women were not
allowed even to get out of the home without the husband's permission.
Now, things have changed. They are more outspoken and courageous.
Women have become aware of their rights and are fighting for
equality," he said.</TE>
<TE>   According to official figures, 44,000 Iranians were divorced last
year, a 12% increase from 2000. At the same time, registered
marriages were down 4.5%.</TE>

<HD>Determined D.A. Harbors No Doubt About Murder</HD>
<DH>Justice: Victoria Banks had been sterilized, yet she'd said
she was pregnant. Did she kill the infant, or did it ever exist?</DH>
<SE>Second in a weekly series</SE>
<AU>MICHAEL LUO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUTLER, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Dist. Atty. Bobby Keahey studied the wildly different, ever-changing
statements the three mentally retarded murder suspects had made to
police. In them, he found a pattern.</LD>
<LD>   At one time or another, all three said they heard a baby cry.</LD>
<LD>   When they weren't denying the baby was born, they all said it was
a boy.</LD>
<TE>   And at one time or another, all three mentioned the baby's being
wrapped in a blue blanket (although in some statements, the blanket
was yellow and in others it was blue and yellow, and in still others
it was a towel).</TE>
<TE>   What are the chances of all three suspects mentioning those same
three things when they were questioned separately, Keahey asked in a
recent interview. "If you could do that, you could pick three numbers
on the lottery." (Police records show, however, that two of the
suspects were questioned together at least once and that, between
interrogations, two of them talked together about the case in their
cells.)</TE>
<TE>   True, there were some holes in the case. No body had been found.
There was no physical evidence of a murder, or even of a birth. And
five years earlier, Victoria Banks had undergone a tubal ligation,
making it unlikely she could have conceived the child she and two
others were suspected of killing.</TE>
<TE>   But according to Keahey, he had no reservations about the
evidence, no doubt that the three suspects were guilty.</TE>
<TE>   He brought capital murder charges against Victoria Banks, her
sister Dianne Tucker, and Banks' estranged husband, Medell. (Nearly
two years would pass before the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, last month,
that executing retarded people is unconstitutional.)</TE>
<TE>   Victoria Banks, already serving 15 years on an unrelated charge,
was sent to the death row unit of Tutwiler State Prison for Women,
standard procedure in Alabama for those charged with crimes
punishable by execution. She shared the cellblock with a woman who
had shot a policeman.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 27, 2000, Victoria Banks returned to Butler for her murder
trial at the Choctaw County Courthouse. The three-story brick
building sits in the middle of town. A statue of a Confederate
soldier stands guard on the courthouse lawn. Across the street is the
Dixie Gas Station, which displays the Rebel flag.</TE>
<TE>   A few years earlier, some townsfolk proposed adding another
monument to the courthouse lawn. They wanted to honor a civil rights
protester who had been run down by a white driver right in front of
the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   The board of county commissioners rejected the idea in a 3-2 vote,
all three white members voting no. One of them said he feared the
monument might stir racial tensions.</TE>
<TE>   Now it was the Banks murder case that was making folks uneasy.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a white sheriff, a white D.A., a white judge," said
Tommy Campbell, editor and lone reporter at the Choctaw Advocate.
"The defendants, they're all black, mentally retarded, poor,
indigent."</TE>
<TE>   Victoria Banks entered the courtroom in clothes borrowed from her
lawyer's wife. She followed her attorneys' directions, looking at the
jurors and keeping her hands folded in her lap.</TE>
<TE>   She stood trial alone, with Medell Banks and Dianne Tucker
scheduled to be tried later.</TE>
<TE>   Among the witnesses for the prosecution were the two evangelists
who had visited Victoria Banks in jail. The young women were positive
she had been pregnant. They came across as smart, honest and
convincing.</TE>
<TE>   Would such testimony convince jurors that Victoria Banks had
become pregnant despite her tubal ligation--that she was the one
woman in 100 whose tubes grow back together after the procedure?</TE>
<TE>   A simple medical test could show for sure whether her tubes were
still blocked. If they were, her lawyers thought, she would almost
certainly be acquitted. But what if the test showed the tubes had
reopened? That might be enough to send her to the electric chair.</TE>
<TE>   Weighing the risks and benefits of learning the truth, defense
lawyers decided it was too big a risk to take.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth day of the trial was devoted to tape recordings of
Victoria Banks' conflicting denials and confessions, made during the
weeks she was questioned without the advice of a lawyer. With the
jury absent, Circuit Court Judge Harold Crow spent several hours
listening to the scratchy audio and then to lawyers debating whether
they should be admitted into evidence.</TE>
<TE>   The issue was undecided as court adjourned for the evening.
Keahey, the prosecutor, approached Spencer Walker, a defense lawyer,
in the hallway and offered a deal:</TE>
<TE>   Banks could plead guilty to manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   She would be sentenced to 15 years, to be served concurrently with
her conviction for helping her abusive boyfriend rape her daughter.
That meant she wouldn't have to serve a single additional day in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   But, as a condition of the plea agreement, she would have to
declare that she had given birth and that her sister and estranged
husband had been present.</TE>
<TE>   Walker weighed the odds. Accepting the plea would remove the risk
that Victoria Banks might be sentenced to life in prison, or even
executed.</TE>
<TE>   However, it would undermine Medell Banks' and Dianne Tucker's
defense.</TE>
<TE>   Walker didn't represent them. It was Victoria Banks' interest he
was duty-bound to protect.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, he explained the offer as best he could to his
client. She asked a few tentative questions but didn't seem to
agonize. He gave her the weekend to be sure.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 4, 2000, Victoria Banks stood before the judge and mumbled
her acceptance of the guilty plea.</TE>
<TE>   Several months later, Medell Banks, accompanied by several of his
relatives, sat in a small conference room at the courthouse to
consider a deal Keahey had for him.</TE>
<TE>   Medell Banks' court-appointed lawyer, Rick Hutchinson, had never
handled a capital murder case before. His practice consisted largely
of Social Security law. But the devout Seventh-day Adventist harbored
a deep belief in individual rights and social justice.</TE>
<TE>   This case wasn't about justice, he told his client. It was about
figuring the odds.</TE>
<TE>   There is little evidence that you committed a crime, Hutchinson
said, speaking slowly to help his client understand. Medell Banks had
spent 12 years in special education and his IQ was just slightly
higher than his wife's.</TE>
<TE>   But juries can be hard to predict, Hutchinson said. There is
always a chance you could be found guilty. If that happens,
Hutchinson said, you will probably be sentenced to life in prison
without parole.</TE>
<TE>   You can remove that risk, the lawyer continued, by accepting the
prosecutor's deal and pleading guilty to the lesser charge of
manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   Circuit Court Judge Lee McPhearson would sentence you to no less
than 10 years and no more than 15, Hutchinson said. Because of prison
overcrowding, well behaved Alabama inmates typically serve about a
third of their sentences before being paroled. And the 22 months you
have spent in prison awaiting trail would count as part of your
sentence, he told his client.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchinson used a yellow legal pad to do the math. Accept the
plea, he told Medell Banks, and you could be out of prison in 18
months, or at worst in 38 months.</TE>
<TE>   The defendant and his family members spent two hours talking about
what to do, weighing the odds. Several times the defendant wept, his
relatives recalled later.</TE>
<TE>   Medell Banks kept bringing up his son from a previous marriage. If
he gambled and lost, he might never see the boy again. It was a risk
he just couldn't take.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting ready to say I'm guilty for something I didn't do,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   His co-defendant, Dianne Tucker, was offered the same deal. After
a similar discussion with her lawyer, she made the same decision.</TE>
<TE>   On May 7, 2001, they both stood before Judge McPhearson and
pleaded guilty.</TE>
<TE>   The judge rejected the 10-year sentence their lawyers had hoped
for and imposed 15 years. The fate of the three mentally retarded
defendants, it seemed, was settled.</TE>
<TE>   But Hutchinson, Medell Banks' lawyer, wasn't ready to give up. He
had one last card to play.</TE>
<TE>   The medical test that would determine once and for all if Victoria
Banks' tubal ligation remained intact was too much of a risk when she
was on trial for her life, but there was nothing to lose now.</TE>
<TE>   Last July, Victoria Banks lay on an examination table at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham as a doctor injected dye into her
uterus.</TE>
<TE>   If the dye spread from her uterus, through the fallopian tubes, to
her ovaries--a distance of 4 inches--it would mean Victoria Banks
could conceive and give birth. But if the dye stopped in the tubes,
it would mean the tubal ligation was still intact.</TE>
<TE>   On a TV monitor, the dye was a ghostly black against the white of
Victoria Banks' internal organs. Three lives depended on this,
Hutchinson knew, as he watched the dye slowly fill the uterus and
edge into the tubes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Next week: Where is justice to be found in this confounding case,
the judge wondered.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press correspondent Garry Mitchell in Mobile
contributed to this report.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE STORY SO FAR</TE>
<TE>   When Victoria Banks said she was pregnant, the jail doctor thought
the retarded woman was faking. After all, she'd had her tubes tied
years before. But when a second doctor detected a fetal heartbeat,
Banks was released to have her baby. Months later, she had neither a
swollen stomach nor a baby. The sheriff of Butler, Ala., suspected
murder, but a search turned up no physical evidence of a killing, or
even of a birth. Banks and two of her relatives, both also retarded,
told investigators wildly conflicting stories. In some accounts,
Banks was never pregnant; in others, she miscarried; in others, the
baby was murdered, although the killer's name shifted with each
telling. It fell to District Atty. Bobby Keahey to make sense of all
this. He had no doubt about what to do.</TE>

<HD>Vampires Are No Myth in Mexico</HD>
<DH>Biology: Blood-eating bats strike cattle and humans alike,
mingling a European legend with reality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK STEVENSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Vampires are real, in bat form anyway, and many Mexicans have to live
with them, along with dozens of other harmless bats.</LD>
<LD>   Mexico--among the first places where Europeans saw blood-eating
bats--may have been the birthplace of the modern Vampire myth, which
associates the flying mammals with the much older legend of the
living dead.</LD>
<LD>   Oscar Barcelo, who runs a herd of cattle in the southern state of
Chiapas--where a 2000 epidemic of bat-borne rabies killed thousands
of cattle--has firsthand experience with real vampires.</LD>
<TE>   "You see the bite marks on the cattle, then you start seeing the
symptoms, and then the cows just buckle at the back legs and die,"
said Barcelo. "Between my father, my brother and I, we lost 100 head.</TE>
<TE>   "We hate the vampires because of all the damage they cause."</TE>
<TE>   It's not always just damage.</TE>
<TE>   "We have documented in indigenous communities that they will feed
on humans," said Steve Walker, executive director of Texas-based Bat
Conservation International. Mexico's Indian communities are among the
nation's most rural, poor and vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   The western state of Nayarit reported a small outbreak, with 45
people reportedly bitten by vampires in the first three months of the
year, said Andrea Romero of the state public health department.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, vampires feed on cattle, but there are cases of attacks
on humans who sleep out in the open or leave their doors and windows
open at night," Romero said.</TE>
<TE>   Vampires were once rare and jungle-dwelling, but with
deforestation and the expansion of cattle ranches, "their food source
has just multiplied enormously," Walker said.</TE>
<TE>   Separating myth from reality is hard.</TE>
<TE>   The vampire myth, born many centuries ago in Eastern Europe,
describes the monsters as corpses that somehow came to life. They had
no connection with bats because vampire bats do not exist in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   But in Mexico--where the Spanish came in 1519-- the old myth met
the new.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the Spanish came here, vampires were just living corpses,"
bat researcher Rodrigo Medellin said. "But when [conquistador Hernan]
Cortes landed at Veracruz and the bats began feasting on his horses,
the myth was born."</TE>
<TE>   One enduring myth is that the bats suck blood through straw-like
teeth. They don't. They simply bite their prey, then lap up the
blood.</TE>
<TE>   The vampire bats are, however, genteel enough to spit out a bit of
natural anesthetic and an anticoagulant that has new medical uses.</TE>
<TE>   Their bite itself isn't harmful, and bats usually carry the same
low incidence of rabies as other mammals, though in some colonies and
in some areas that rate can increase.</TE>
<TE>   Three species of vampire bats range over Mexico, Central America
and the tip of South America. They're hard to love, even though Maria
Luisa Franco, an educator who works for the Migratory Mammal
Conservation Program, tries, passing out storybooks in rural
communities about "Valentin," a little vampire bat who tries not to
eat blood -- but must.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't very well tell the kids that Valentin is cute and
lovable," Franco said, "when they see vampires swoop down at night
and bite the cattle."</TE>

<HD>A Different Breed of Backpacker Treks to Thailand</HD>
<DH>Asia: Unlike earlier footloose brigades, today's young
travelers to Bangkok's Khao San Road stay longer and carry plastic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENIS D. GRAY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>BANGKOK, Thailand</DL>
<LD>Where have all the gritty backpackers gone, those shoestring
vagabonds from the West with soiled, baggy garb who considered body
odor the badge of a true traveler.</LD>
<LD>   On Bangkok's Khao San Road, one of the world's densest
concentrations of young travelers, the scruffy backpacker seems on
the road to extinction, the stuff of nostalgia and Hollywood movies.</LD>
<LD>   The youthful brigades still struggle under overstuffed backpacks,
clutch their Lonely Planet guides, scour for bargains and fuel up on
muesli, banana pancakes and hummus. But they're different.</LD>
<TE>   "The image of the backpacker is of someone laying around on a
beach getting stoned, and a small percentage are like that," says
Eleanor Land, a neatly dressed 18-year-old from Edinburgh, Scotland.
"But most travel to learn as much about a country as they can."</TE>
<TE>   Ordering a 10-baht (24-cent) bowl of noodles from a street vendor,
she's on her "gap year," the time-out young Britons take between high
school and university. Land spent four months teaching slum children
in India and is traveling in Southeast Asia with friends for two
months.</TE>
<TE>   John Hughes, a British expatriate who runs a Web site about Khao
San Road, says young people taking breaks in schooling and those
seeking temporary employment and learning opportunities abroad have
largely replaced the travelers of old who wandered as far and as long
as their money would take them. And there are some older ones who
come back drawn by fond memories of their younger backpacking days.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me that a lot of backpackers have plastic in their
back pockets whereas they didn't before," says Hughes, who first
encountered Khao San Road 15 years ago. "They're better organized and
getting more packaged."</TE>
<TE>   Khao San has likewise undergone dramatic change. The 300-yard
strip and surrounding alleys, near the Grand Palace and other
historic sights, have mushroomed from a few wooden, family-run
guesthouses in the early 1980s into a thriving tourism area.</TE>
<TE>   "Khao San Road -- anything you can ever want," says Scott
Robinson, quoting a line from "The Beach," a novel turned into a
Hollywood movie that boosted the popularity of the road and
Thailand's backpacking culture.</TE>
<TE>   While two older Thai women twist his hair into dreadlocks, the
21-year-old Robinson talks about his upcoming eight months of travel,
a liberating pause from studies and a love affair back in Sydney,
Australia. Meanwhile, he's experiencing Khao San Road and staying at
a guesthouse for 150 baht a night, or about $3.50. "You can sometimes
get it for 90 baht."</TE>
<TE>   But the area now also features several upscale hotels and trendy
night spots, the latter attracting well-heeled Thais who once shunned
the neighborhood as a ghetto for uncouth farangs (foreigners).</TE>
<TE>   Travelers can still get their bodies tattooed and pierced, eat for
rock-bottom prices and pick up a fake "International Press Card" or
"British Columbia Driving License." But Khao San has sprouted
shopping arcades, American chain convenience stores, tailors and
plenty of ATMs.</TE>
<TE>   As testimony to backpacker spending power, rents in the area now
equal those along Silom Road, Bangkok's "Wall Street," says Nopporn
Bhuttan, a member of the Khao San Road Business Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Thai tourism officials who once paid scant attention to the
district have realized there's big baht in backpacking. The Tourism
Authority of Thailand says 1.5 million under-25 visitors came to
Thailand last year, representing more than 15% of total arrivals.
Mostly students, they stay longer and leave more of their money with
local businesses than mainline tourists, whose spending at
international hotels and travel agencies often doesn't go in Thai
coffers.</TE>
<TE>   Two other trends warm Thai hearts. Whereas most backpackers in
earlier days were Westerners, followed later by the Japanese, Khao
San Road now attracts Koreans, Taiwanese and Hong Kong citizens. Vast
potential is seen in China and India.</TE>
<TE>   Thailand has grown into a regional "backpack headquarters." Young
tourists crowd dozens of Khao San travel agencies to buy cheap air
tickets to Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and elsewhere. Many return from
those less-developed destinations to rest, recuperate and replenish
supplies before venturing out again.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics view backpackers, past and present, as despoilers of
cultural and natural environments. Others lament that the serendipity
of life on the road has vanished, with most of today's backpackers
sticking to themselves along well-worn paths.</TE>
<TE>   Nopporn, whose family has run businesses on the road for 30 years,
is of two minds. "In the old days, there was a more family, more
friendly, feeling," he says. "You knew the customers. Now it's more
business. It's both good and bad."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Child Warriors Easing Into Mainstream</HD>
<DH>Africa: A year ago, they were feared, fighting in Sierra
Leone's civil war. Now, thousands of youngsters are trying to reclaim
lost childhoods.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEXANDRA ZAVIS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>FREETOWN, Sierra Leone</DL>
<LD>Kicking a soccer ball in a bustling street, 12-year-old Moses is
indistinguishable from the other ragged children in this
bullet-scarred capital.</LD>
<LD>   Little more than a year ago, the shy boy with an easy smile was
part of the rebel movement that terrorized this West African nation
for a decade, its fighters raping, maiming and killing adults and
children even younger than Moses.</LD>
<LD>   Now, like thousands of others, he is back with his family, trying
to reclaim a childhood torn apart by bloodshed and fear.</LD>
<TE>   An estimated 7,000 children left the battlefields when combatants
in Sierra Leone's savage civil war started turning in their weapons
last year. The youngest was 6 years old.</TE>
<TE>   Released into the care of aid agencies, most spent months at
centers designed to ease their way back into civilian life and now
are reunited with relatives.</TE>
<TE>   For many like Moses, whose mother, brother and two sisters were
shot to death in front of him when he was kidnapped two years ago,
the struggle to adjust into the families and communities from which
they were torn is only just starting.</TE>
<TE>   When Moses first got home, he got into fights, and the neighbors
were always complaining about him, his uncle says. But with time--and
discipline--his behavior has improved. He is now helpful around the
house and does well at school, the uncle says.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel happy," says Moses, a skinny boy in shorts and plastic
sandals.</TE>
<TE>   "I am learning a lot. I have friends, and we play together."</TE>
<TE>   But when asked about the months he spent with the rebels, his face
clouds.</TE>
<TE>   "What I saw in the bush is too terrible to explain," he whispers,
eyes downcast, twisting his hands in his lap.</TE>
<TE>   Child soldiers like Moses were among the most feared in Sierra
Leone.</TE>
<TE>   Abducted and forced to fight by all factions, they demonstrated
little fear in combat and committed some of the worst atrocities of a
grisly war.</TE>
<TE>   "We were given drugs and told to attack, burn houses, rape women
and take what you like," says Boyzie, 15, who was even younger than
Moses when he was captured by the rebels and forced to do these
things.</TE>
<TE>   He pulls up a grimy sleeve to reveal scars where he says rebels
cut his arm to inject cocaine and other drugs he can't identify.
Under their influence, "a person just looks like any chicken," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   After months of counseling, Boyzie was reunited with an older
cousin who lives at a camp for displaced people. But he didn't stay
long.</TE>
<TE>   His cousin, who is married with three young daughters, found it
difficult to share her one-room shelter with a teenage boy and asked
him to find a place of his own.</TE>
<TE>   She still feeds him when she can. But he sleeps in an abandoned
car with four other former rebels at the garage where they are
training to become mechanics under a government-sponsored program.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations Children's Fund, or UNICEF, says many child
soldiers find it difficult to stay with their families. Many are in
regions that were destroyed by the war, with no schools, job
opportunities or enough food to go around.</TE>
<TE>   Some are rejected by their communities--including members of their
own families--because of the atrocities they committed, UNICEF
representative Joanna Van Gerpen says.</TE>
<TE>   Even when friends and neighbors don't know what the children did,
the stigma of having been associated with the rebels--even as
captives--can make it difficult to fit in.</TE>
<TE>   "They come from a very brutal war.... Everybody is still afraid of
them," says the owner of the garage where Boyzie works. He asked not
to be quoted by name to protect the identity of his young
apprentices.</TE>
<TE>   Many child fighters were themselves commanders, and were also
sexually active, making it difficult to live in what often are
one-room dwellings under the authority of parents or other adults.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed, who says he is 18 but who social workers believe is much
younger, says with some pride that he was a "strong man in the bush."</TE>
<TE>   Kidnapped when he was no older than 9, he rose through the ranks
to head a unit of child fighters and got a "girlfriend" by abducting
her.</TE>
<TE>   "We never bought anything.... We just took it," the boy dubbed
"Black Cat" by his captors says at the group home where he is waiting
to be reunited with an older brother. "Now, when I want something, I
have to think about finding a job."</TE>
<TE>   But jobs are scarce, and Sierra Leone's economy is in ruins.</TE>
<TE>   In neighboring Liberia, which was destroyed by a 1989-96 civil
war, pressures like these pushed many former child fighters onto the
streets of the capital, Monrovia. From there, some were drawn into
crime--or back into fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Today, young children toting machine guns are again among the
soldiers battling a 3-year-old insurrection in the north of
Liberia--though their commanders claim the youngsters are only there
to do cooking, laundry and other camp chores.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to avoid a repeat in Sierra Leone, UNICEF and other
agencies strive to keep in touch with former child soldiers. Social
workers meet regularly with the children, their families, teachers
and other community members to provide counseling and mediation.</TE>
<TE>   But with tens of thousands of Sierra Leone citizens on the move,
returning to areas from which they were displaced by the war, UNICEF
concedes that it is difficult to keep track of the children.</TE>
<TE>   It can also be hard to break the youngsters' links with former
commanders.</TE>
<TE>   The Revolutionary United Front rebels formed a political party to
contest recent elections, and Boyzie says he was approached by some
of his former friends to help campaign.</TE>
<TE>   This time, at least, he said no.</TE>
<TE>   "I suffered a lot with the gun," he explains. "I am at work
now.... I am capable of doing better."</TE>

<HD>Portugal Pits Yield Exquisite Marble</HD>
<DH>Geology: The southern Alentejo region, one of Europe's
poorest, is rich in the expensive rock. It's even used to make public
benches and sidewalks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK WILSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>VILA VICOSA, Portugal</DL>
<LD>An earth mover slowly sinks into the gloom of the marble quarry,
lowered by a crane until its driver looks barely bigger than a
pinprick, 360 feet below.</LD>
<LD>   Floodlights on the pit floor glow through a cloud of marble dust,
lighting up an elevator that hums as it glides up the side of the
150-foot-wide hole in the earth. The bottom is a pool of fine, white
mud.</LD>
<LD>   Looking up from the floor, it's almost like being in a cathedral.
Massive blocks of marble half cut out of the walls rise above,
framing the blue sky.</LD>
<TE>   The earth mover easily pushes over an 18-ton block, which a
diamond-toothed steel cable has cut away.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need earmuffs or dust masks. This is enough protection,"
says supervisor Antonio Zebo, tapping his cloth cap. "But we do use
steel toe-capped boots," he adds, noting that falling rocks have
killed eight workers over the last 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Such quarries are a common sight in Portugal's southern Alentejo
region. Cranes poke into the sky all around, hanging over marble pits
like gigantic herons.</TE>
<TE>   At dusk, church bells cut through the mechanical noise while a
shepherd and his flock make their way past the centuries-old St.
Mark's Church, which now stands on the edge of this gash in the green
hills.</TE>
<TE>   A few miles away at a marble export company, the rough marble
blocks are shaped into tiles.</TE>
<TE>   Company boss Jorge Placido says polishing is the most difficult
process.</TE>
<TE>   "It has to be cut by diamonds, but it's extremely delicate,"
polisher Paulo Magarreiro says, banging a steel tape measure on his
marble workbench to show how easy it is to scratch the rock.</TE>
<TE>   Magarreiro uses a blowtorch on the marble. Heating it allows the
resin he spreads on the rock to react better, smoothing the surface.
The veins of the marble are just visible beneath the creamy film.</TE>
<TE>   He cuts the slabs into tiles measuring about nine square feet.
Each one is sold for $26.</TE>
<TE>   Marble is an expensive commodity most places. But in Alentejo, one
of Europe's poorest regions, even sidewalks, butcher's lintels and
public benches are made of marble, which is the area's cheapest
building material.</TE>
<TE>   Placido says all Portuguese marble is quarried in the
12-square-mile region. It has unique features and has been sought
after since Roman times, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "One of our buyers in Japan, Italy or an Arab country could look
at our marble and know it's from the Alentejo, by the color and
veins," he says.</TE>

<DH>Venezuela: Ushering in the rainy season at spring
festivals, residents pray for a good harvest and a respite from
political tensions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEXANDRA OLSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Incense mingles with the aroma of home-cooked stew, as neighbors
leave their shanties jammed against one another here in the capital's
Sucre neighborhood and take their places before a makeshift altar on
a steep, narrow road.</LD>
<LD>   Palms raised for prayer, they face a cross covered in carnations,
roses and jasmine, lit by candles and accompanied by statues of
saints. Woven palm branches tied with white ribbons arc over the
display.</LD>
<LD>   "We ask this sacred cross, before us now, to protect us--to
eliminate violence in our homeland, to protect our homeland, and help
us reach peace," says prayer leader Oscar Larrua, raising a rosary
toward the night sky. Eyes close in concentration, the crowd echoes
the prayer for half an hour--then erupts in rowdy celebration.</LD>
<TE>   Such festivals take place throughout Venezuela each spring to
usher in the rainy season, pray for a prosperous harvest, pay homage
to nature--and hope for a respite from the political tensions and
crime that grip this South American country.</TE>
<TE>   Brought to Venezuela by Spanish colonialists, the ritual has
evolved to include indigenous, Afro-Caribbean and more modern
elements. Improvised altars with the blossom-draped cross as the
centerpiece dot street corners, hillsides and plazas across the
country. Originally a rural observance, poor migrants brought the
festival to Caracas.</TE>
<TE>   In Sucre, residents have put on the ritual for 18 years, praying
for an end to crime, drugs and political instability.</TE>
<TE>   "This street is very united," said Omaira Aviarez, 55, who
introduced the festival locally. "Everyone pitches in to make the
altar. The neighbors all lend their own saints. Look, the kids help
too," she added, pointing to a row of miniature altars made by
children.</TE>
<TE>   Sucre residents are proud that their ceremony has become famous in
Caracas. City leaders borrowed their colorful cross for a tribute to
people killed in riots and protests during a short-lived coup in
April against President Hugo Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm praying especially for peace so that we can end divisions,"
university student Myriam Brito said. "The rich are always on their
side, and the poor on this side," she added, taking a sip of
calentado, a warm licorice drink.</TE>
<TE>   There is no specific date for the ritual. Neighborhoods put on the
outdoor festivities any night they wish.</TE>
<TE>   Feasts are always a potluck of homemade traditional Venezuelan
dishes: hallacas, tamales wrapped in plantain leaves; sancocho, a
chicken stew with chunks of yucca, potatoes and plantain; various
fruit-based sweets.</TE>
<TE>   The partying lasts all night. In steaming coastal towns,
descendants of African slaves beat polished, hollow logs, called
tambores, and villagers circle around couples performing a sensual
stomping dance. In the southwestern plains, cowboys play guitars and
croon romantic and patriotic tunes.</TE>
<TE>   At Sucre's festival, a neighborhood band plays violins, maracas
and cuatros--traditional Venezuelan guitars with four strings.
Someone passes around a bottle of rum. Cheers erupt when an old woman
brings out calentado from her native Andean mountain town. After
midnight, everyone digs into the sancocho and downs another round of
calentado.</TE>
<TE>   But before the carousing comes piety. During the prayer service, a
group of toddlers shriek down the hill on scooters. Elderly women in
faded frocks admonish them, and they sheepishly abandon their
scooters and scurry to squat before the altar.</TE>

<HD>Stolen Fertilizer Used to Make Drugs</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>BECKY BOHRER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>BILLINGS, Mont.</DL>
<LD>Charlie Bumgarner didn't even know at first that thieves had been
just feet from his farmhouse. It wasn't until he spotted the siphon
hoses near his two big fertilizer tanks that he realized he'd been
ripped off.</LD>
<LD>   "My father and grandfather had people steal fuel or tools," said
Bumgarner. "This is something we've never had to deal with before."</LD>
<LD>   Farmers like Bumgarner have become popular targets of criminals
who steal anhydrous ammonia fertilizer to make the drug
methamphetamine. They steal it in such small amounts that thefts
often go unnoticed. And officials admit they have had little success
in curbing the problem.</LD>
<TE>   But Bill Mercer, the U.S. attorney for Montana, said that could
change in the next six months when officials launch a public
awareness campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "We've raised a lot of attention about meth. Now, we're at a point
where we'd like to do more specialized training with this narrower
focus," he said.</TE>
<TE>   County sheriffs in north-central Montana, one area hit hard by
fertilizer thefts, say they'll take what help they can get to catch
thieves.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pursuing them as best as we can. But you have to take into
account, a lot of these [theft] sites get very little traffic," said
Capt. Dan Smrdel of the Cascade County sheriff's office. "Catching
someone in the act is an exception. They can see you coming for
miles."</TE>
<TE>   Anhydrous ammonia is close to pure nitrogen and is used on a wide
variety of crops to increase growth. In Montana, it is often applied
in the fall or early spring.</TE>
<TE>   Meth-makers mix it with ingredients such as paint thinner and cold
medicine to make what police call "poor man's cocaine." The Drug
Enforcement Administration has called methamphetamine the
fastest-growing U.S. drug threat.</TE>
<TE>   Thieves have become increasingly brazen, sneaking at night onto
farms and storage sites kept by chemical dealerships and helping
themselves to samples from 1,000-gallon tanks like those on
Bumgarner's farm.</TE>
<TE>   They only need a little--often less than a gallon for a vat of
meth--and just a few minutes to get it. Often they leave no trace
behind. Other times, broken tank valves, spliced fences and dangling
hoses provide clues to the thefts.</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Mathers, a spokeswoman for the Fertilizer Institute, a
Washington-based trade organization, said the thefts have occurred
just about everywhere there are isolated farms or storage sites.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something we've seen happen anywhere the product is sold at
the retail level," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Police and Montana agricultural officials have been trying to
alert more farmers to the problem and ask for their help. An
important step they can take, authorities say, is to add extra
security at their tanks and watch out for their neighbors' tanks.</TE>
<TE>   "There's only so much each of us can do," Long said.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is the desire for the drug," Mathers added. "It
causes people to basically forget they have lives.... And, in the
case of ammonia, risk their lives to get it."</TE>
<TE>   Russ Miner, fertilizer manager at United Agri Products in Great
Falls, warns of the danger of the chemical to anyone who isn't
trained to handle it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of amazing. These guys that are taking it, if you get
it on your bare skin, it burns you," he said. "You just never hear
about anyone ending up in the hospital."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Schumacher said a major fear for him is having a thief get
hurt at one of his storage sites. Thefts, he said, have occurred
consistently over the last three years at the rural tank site of
Farmers Union Oil Co. near Great Falls, despite fences, lights and
motion sensors.</TE>
<TE>   "They cut locks, open valves, cut fences. Those are things we've
had to absorb," Schumacher said, estimating the financial sting at
$5,000. More significant, he said, is the time spent checking sites
and sometimes having to rouse employees from bed to do it.</TE>
<TE>   Chouteau County Sheriff Doug Williams and his deputies, who devote
about 15% of their time to the thefts and other meth-related crimes,
rely heavily on help from the public.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't see this trend stopping anytime soon, but we're not
going to give up. The results of giving up are not good," he said.</TE>

<HD>Conservation at Odds With Greenery Rules</HD>
<DH>Landscape: Western areas facing drought push for homeowners
to try more xeriscaping. But they can run afoul of planting
guidelines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM KORTE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The city-owned parking strip in front of Josh Blumental's home has
become one of the front lines in Utah's growing battle over water
conservation.</LD>
<LD>   "One-hundred-ninety-two square feet of trouble," he said.</LD>
<LD>   When morning glory choked out his grass last summer, Blumental
recalled a flurry of water-conservation messages from City Hall and
began installing a rock garden in his frontyard.</LD>
<TE>   The citations began arriving this spring, warning Blumental that
his strip didn't comply with city codes and threatening him with
fines of $25 a day until he planted more greenery.</TE>
<TE>   City officials later called it a mistake, saying enforcement
officers misinterpreted the law. But as Utah enters its fourth year
of drought, the dispute illustrates the dilemma of balancing a
limited water supply with a public demand for greenery.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened with Josh's strip is the intent of the law didn't
match exactly to the letter of law," said Stephanie Duer, the city's
water conservation officer. "Salt Lake City didn't intend to cause
problems for anyone."</TE>
<TE>   For years, Western cities have sought ways to save water, and some
have begun writing conservation into law.</TE>
<TE>   In Albuquerque, a 1995 ordinance limits high-water lawns to 20% of
total lot size. In Carson, Calif., the water district is testing a
desalination pilot plant this week, hoping to cut dependence on
Colorado River water.</TE>
<TE>   It's impossible to develop national xeriscape guidelines because,
by definition, natural landscaping differs by region, said Beth
Young, spokeswoman for the American Society of Landscape Architects
in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   "Too often, people associate xeriscape with desert landscaping,"
she said. "What it means is smart land use. Don't put plants in the
ground that don't belong and try to use plants that will save water."</TE>
<TE>   Utah is trying to do its part.</TE>
<TE>   Perched on the edge of a desert, Salt Lake and other communities
along the 80-mile Wasatch Front get twice as much rain as more arid
regional cities such as Albuquerque or Phoenix and four times as much
as Las Vegas. But that still is only 16 inches a year, to support
neighborhoods of lush green lawns and canopies of shade trees.</TE>
<TE>   When mountain snowpacks dwindled in recent years, Gov. Mike
Leavitt and other elected officials began emphasizing water
conservation statewide. Last year, Salt Lake Mayor Rocky Anderson
even had his yard xeriscaped.</TE>
<TE>   But despite the public call for conservation, city enforcement
officers informed Blumental this spring that city code requires his
strip had to be 33% greenery. When he appealed, Duer told him he has
three years to comply.</TE>
<TE>   There's more to water conservation, though, than removing the
grass. In Blumental's case, Duer said his Siberian irises--planted
next to ornamental stacks of rounded river rocks--need a lot of water
and thus weren't the best choice for his full-sun strip. Thyme or
low-growing juniper would have been better, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "His plants are not particularly water conserving," Duer said.
"What is water conserving about his landscape is that there's no
irrigation system. That's where he's saving water."</TE>
<TE>   For that matter, Duer said irrigation systems at many homes are
big water wasters and that drip lines are more efficient for natural
landscapes than pop-up or rotating sprinklers.</TE>
<TE>   "The real focus should be how we deliver water," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if codes become friendlier to the practice, there is a
question of whether city dwellers will accept the weedy landscapes
native to the Wasatch Front that qualify as xeriscapes. Landscape
architect David C. Racker of Bountiful, just north of Salt Lake, said
many of his customers change their minds after seeing xeriscaping.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're looking for beauty and consistency, predictability and
uniformity, then xeriscape plants in this part of Utah generally
deviate from that," said Racker, a fellow of the American Society of
Landscape Architects.</TE>
<TE>   Blumental won't argue the point. After his experience, he believes
residents "have an expectation of what they want" for their yards,
and it's not natural landscapes.</TE>
<TE>   "They think they live in Omaha or Kansas City, but they don't," he
said. "You'd think with the amount of people living here, they'd
consider [xeriscapes]. To not do it, that comes with a price. You
have to make a choice."</TE>
<TE>   From the city's standpoint, Duer hopes to channel publicity
generated by the quarrel toward water-conservation education. She's
also reviewing the ordinance to make it more cohesive, taking into
account needs of different neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a good thing," she said. "I thought I knew what to do
with the ordinance, but I didn't have an example in my head. Now, I
can ask myself, 'How can I word this so the landscape is approved?' "</TE>

<HD>Holding Their Ground (Water) Against a Development Boom</HD>
<DH>Conservation: Wells and streams run dry as development
covers more land. Experts turn to systems that minimize runoff,
refilling aquifers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL BERGSTROM</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>VILLANOVA, Pa.</DL>
<LD>A roof that sprouts plants or a parking lot that drains rainwater
like a sieve may not be a sign of neglect. Instead, it might be the
latest in ground water conservation.</LD>
<LD>   Vegetation to hold water on rooftops and pavement that lets it
percolate into the ground instead of racing away through storm drains
are some of the latest ways environmental engineers are trying to
combat sprawling development and save water tables.</LD>
<LD>   Such strategies are becoming increasingly prevalent--and
necessary--as development covers more land with buildings and
pavement, causing the water table to drop, drying up wells and
streams.</LD>
<TE>   "The water is not getting back into the soil, so it's not
recharging the aquifers," said Maya K. van Rossum of the Delaware
Riverkeeper Network in Washington Crossing, Pa. "When you're having
rainfall, you have water dumped directly into the creek. This is why
we've been hearing more and more in recent years about flooding and
drought.</TE>
<TE>   "These problems have the same genesis."</TE>
<TE>   Recent droughts have focused attention on how development
spreading into rural areas affects ground water supplies. When David
E. Hess became secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection a year ago, he declared water resources an
urgent priority.</TE>
<TE>   Any threat to ground water poses problems for about 4.5 million
Pennsylvanians who get water from wells and springs, and those who
drill about 10,000 new wells every year. More than 100 communities in
the Southeastern Pennsylvania Ground Water Protected Area depend on
ground water.</TE>
<TE>   Homes are the biggest users, consuming nearly half the ground
water used. The rest is split almost evenly between industry and
agriculture/mining.</TE>
<TE>   Even when spreading development covers the land with pavement and
concrete, some of the problems can be avoided, environmental experts
say.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Traver, an associate professor of civil and environmental
engineering at Villanova University, demonstrated by using a low area
of sandy soil and vegetation near a campus parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   Formerly a small hill, it was excavated to a depth of 4 feet, the
soil was mixed with sand, and the basin was filled back in to just
below parking-lot level.</TE>
<TE>   Now rain and melting snow from the parking lot and a nearby
basketball court drain into the basin, soak into the sandy soil and
seep down into the ground water. The parking lot's storm drains still
would carry off any overflow, but Traver said in the several months
since it was built, the infiltration basin has absorbed all the rain,
with no overflows.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little thing," Traver said. "The idea is to build a lot of
little things and maybe avoid some of the big detention basins"
needed to catch the torrents of water from fast-running storm drain
systems.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Cahill of Cahill Associates, an environmental consulting firm
in West Chester, Pa., has been advocating such practices for years.</TE>
<TE>   "In the current development patterns that we follow, we build
structures and they are impervious; we surround them with asphalt,
and that is impervious," Cahill said.</TE>
<TE>   On land covered with trees and vegetation, only about 8 inches of
a normal year's rainfall of about 45 inches in Pennsylvania runs off,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "When we cover that with a rooftop or pavement, we turn all that
rain into immediate runoff. Instead of the 8 inches to 9 inches of
runoff, we have 45 inches," Cahill said.</TE>
<TE>   "I usually show a community their favorite mall parking lot. I
say, 'Picture this area covered with 3 feet of water and you have an
idea what it's done to the water balance of the area.' "</TE>
<TE>   That can change, Cahill said, with projects like a porous-pavement
parking lot he helped design as a storage and staging area for new
Mustangs at Ford Rouge Center in Dearborn, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Porous asphalt or concrete lets storm water through, flowing into
a crushed stone bed where it seeps down into the ground. That can
avoid the need for detention basins and channels and preserve wooded
or swampy areas that would be scooped out for detention ponds. Morris
Arboretum in Philadelphia has a similar parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   On a big mall project, porous pavement can create a huge ground
water recharge area. "All the roof drains go into the underground
bed, so there's no roof runoff," Cahill said.</TE>
<TE>   "The best measure is to go out in the middle of a thunderstorm and
to watch the water drain through."</TE>

<HD>An Experiment Nets a Lifetime of Health Care</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Half a century ago, Nellie Parker became a
pharmaceutical test subject in exchange for perpetual coverage. At
97, she's reaping benefits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON COHEN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Her silver hair is tucked under her lavender sun hat, and a sandaled
foot dangles from the examining room table. Over the decades, the
97-year-old patient's clinic visits have become a ritual.</LD>
<LD>   "How's your hand?" the doctor asks Nellie Parker, gently rubbing a
swollen finger she cut while opening a can of dog food. "You need to
put on some lotion."</LD>
<LD>   Nellie smiles sheepishly as the doctor, one-third her age, checks
her lungs, her heart, her blood pressure. Then she slides off the
table like a schoolgirl relieved that a big test is over.</LD>
<TE>   "This is my second home," she says. "They've done me a lot of good
and they still are doing me good." She stops in her tracks, then does
a little jig.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to come here until I drop dead," she vows. "Yep."</TE>
<TE>   And she will. Nellie Parker is more than a patient; she's proof of
one company's unusual promise.</TE>
<TE>   In an era when many elderly people can't afford to see a doctor or
complain that drug makers have set prices out of reach, Nellie, who
squeaks by on $400 a month, has no such worries because of a
handshake deal she made about 50 years ago with Eli Lilly &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   She agreed to be a volunteer in the company's testing program for
pernicious anemia, which was then a potentially fatal blood disorder
that had landed her in the hospital. The arrangement was simple:
become a "guinea pig" in exchange for free medical care for life.</TE>
<TE>   The drug company has no written record of this deal, so no one
knows exactly when it was made or what was said, but the pledge has
been honored through the decades.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors and nurses have come and gone, but Nellie has stayed on.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful piece of history being passed on," says Dr.
Charles Benson, the latest physician to treat Nellie. "This is almost
a relic."</TE>
<TE>   Every month, her trusty cabdriver, Paul, arrives at her tidy red
brick house. She negotiates her steep steps -- this day she's decked
out in a gingham pantsuit and pearl earrings -- and heads out for a
checkup and vitamin B-12 shot at the clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Once about 200 people received free medical care for participating
in the testing program, which lasted from the 1940s to the 1980s.
Most of the volunteers have moved away or died. Of the three who
remain, Nellie is the oldest; the others are in their 80s.</TE>
<TE>   They're cared for by nurse Mary Vinson, who has befriended all
three in 23 years on the job. But she's especially devoted to Nellie,
who has been alone since her husband and only son died long ago.</TE>
<TE>   When Nellie's collie ran away, when her refrigerator broke, when
she had problems with her phone bill, along came Mary to find the
dog, to scrounge up a new appliance, to help solve the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never had a grandparent, so I've kind of adopted her,"
Vinson says. "It just doesn't seem fair that someone who has lived
that long has nobody. So we've become her somebody."</TE>
<TE>   "She's my doll baby," Nellie replies, patting the nurse on her
arm.</TE>
<TE>   The two talk regularly and Vinson occasionally takes Nellie
shopping for her favorite foods: caramels, cupcakes and bananas.</TE>
<TE>   "I worry about her," Vinson says. "She never complains."</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1950s, Nellie's free health care has included two
operations -- one for oral cancer, one on her intestines -- as well
as visits to the dermatologist and neurologist, X-rays and
mammograms, medication for high blood pressure, annual physicals and
eye exams.</TE>
<TE>   And speaking of her eyes ...</TE>
<TE>   At age 97, Nellie still doesn't need glasses. "So far," she adds.</TE>
<TE>   And she's trimmer than she used to be. She opens her wallet to
show off a sepia-tinged photo of her as a husky, raven-haired woman,
then tells one doctor how heavy she was.</TE>
<TE>   "204." And how could she possibly remember? "Oooh, honey, I don't
forget nothing. I wanted to lose that weight. It was like jelly on a
plate," she says, shaking her leg.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly says it can't put a price tag on what the medical care has
cost for Nellie and the others, but it's a safe bet it hasn't created
much of a ripple in the bottom line of an $11-billion-plus company.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Benson says, it's the type of arrangement that wouldn't be
started today because it would be too expensive.</TE>
<TE>   The balance sheets of pharmaceutical companies have drawn the
anger of senior citizen groups and many politicians, who say
prescription drugs are often unaffordable for those who desperately
need them. The industry responds that prices are set in part to
recoup the high cost of drug research.</TE>
<TE>   It's rare for a drug company to provide lifetime health care for a
testing volunteer, says Jeff Trewhitt, spokesman for the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.</TE>
<TE>   What's more common, he says, is for companies to pay medical care
for people while they are part of a clinical trial and provide the
medicine being studied, even for a time after the testing is over.</TE>
<TE>   It was a much simpler time when Nellie, then a housekeeper, was
hospitalized, so sick she couldn't walk or talk. "Seems like my whole
body was tired," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Approached by Lilly doctors, she agreed to participate in the drug
maker's testing program.</TE>
<TE>   There was a very personal interest in pernicious anemia research
at the company. The wife of J.K. Lilly Sr., son of the founder,
suffered from the blood disorder, but it was too advanced for any
medicine to effectively help her.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly Sr., a one-time company president, and the doctor who
started the clinic personally made the free-health care guarantee to
those who joined the program.</TE>
<TE>   As Nellie approaches her first century, she has scaled back her
routine. No more Jazzercise. She gave that up at 94. And no more lawn
mowing.</TE>
<TE>   She has high blood pressure and her hearing isn't what it once
was, but considering her age, Nellie is doing well. And she thinks
she knows why: the regular medical care, and something more.</TE>
<TE>   I don't run around," she says with a sly grin. "I don't drink."
She pauses. "I guess it must be working."</TE>

<TE>   The Pals were hardly surprised to see the 3,500-square-foot home
spring up when the property changed hands. In recent years,
construction crews have been swarming the San Juans, a chain of 175
islands some 85 miles north of Seattle. New condos and vacation homes
renting for as much as $4,000 per week are filled with summer
tourists, while even the shabbiest homes are now priced beyond the
reach of most local workers.</TE>
<TE>   The San Juans are not alone in their growing pains.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of such last, best places nationwide--think Nantucket, Key
West, Aspen, Lake Placid--are being all but overwhelmed by their own
appeal, said Jonathan Schechter of the Charture Institute in Jackson,
Wyo., which studies growth issues.</TE>
<TE>   The burning question now, Schechter said, is, "How do you do you
deal with the growing popularity and not do irreversible harm to the
very thing that made you attractive in the first place?"</TE>
<TE>   So far, there are no easy answers.</TE>
<TE>   The San Juans' pull is immediately evident in the crush of ferry
passengers at Anacortes, the mainland departure point. Vacationers
and returning locals packed a ferry bound for San Juan Island on a
recent weekend. They watched from the passenger deck as the bluffs
and thickly forested slopes of a dozen islands slipped past.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a beautiful, beautiful place," said Roger Salquist, 60, a
recent retiree from Davis, Calif., who summers in a guest home he
built on San Juan Island. His main island home is under construction.</TE>
<TE>   San Juan County is one of about 50 tourist areas nationwide
classified by the Charture Institute as PEAS: Places of Ecological or
Aesthetic Significance.</TE>
<TE>   Common pressures facing PEAS include rapid population growth and a
spike in housing prices as the wealthy buy in. Rising prices put more
pressure on wage workers.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the largest affordability gap in the state" when average
wages are compared to home prices, said Sandy Wood, director of the
Lopez Community Land Trust. "We have a great deal of wealth in the
hands of a very few."</TE>
<TE>   The median home price in the San Juans, where singer Jewel is
remodeling a home and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen owns a 385-acre
estate, was $291,000 in 2000. That was 34% more than in 1990, and the
priciest in Washington state.</TE>
<TE>   The county's population grew 40% in the 1990s, to 14,000, faster
than all but one Washington county. That has strained local services
and a limited water supply.</TE>
<TE>   Schechter traces pressures on PEAS in part to new technologies
that allow many professionals to telecommute.</TE>
<TE>   "People are saying, 'I deserve it all. Why should I only go to a
place I really love for two weeks a year, when I can live in the San
Juans, in Jackson Hole or the Florida Keys, work there and have it
all?'"</TE>
<TE>   Some longtime tourist destinations are nearing crisis stage. Many
locals on Nantucket, beloved for its unsullied beaches and maritime
heritage, are being priced off the island.</TE>
<TE>   "The average selling price of a home peaked at about $1.6 million
before this most recent recession. The year-round community cannot
compete," said John Pagini, director of the Nantucket Planning and
Economic Development Commission.</TE>
<TE>   On nearby Martha's Vineyard, a favorite of former President
Clinton, mansions have sprouted like suburban tract homes.</TE>
<TE>   San Juan County ordered a study of Nantucket and Aspen to discover
how it might avoid their crushing growth.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers' answer: Sorry.</TE>
<TE>   "There is little that can be done to prevent the wealthy from
taking over privately owned rural lands and converting farm and
forest to estates and trophy homes," the Aquatic Resources
Conservation Group of Seattle wrote in its study. "The problems of
finding housing for workers and the children of current residents who
are not wealthy will become much worse."</TE>
<TE>   The locals who clerk, cook and carry out the trash in trendy
Friday Harbor on San Juan Island know all about sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people work four jobs to pay rent. You just do it," said
Sharon Touher, 40, a bartender at Herb's tavern rearing two teenage
daughters.</TE>
<TE>   "Apartments go for like $700 a month," said Marc Wynn, 40, a cook
at Downriggers restaurant. "If you're a dishwasher, you're not going
to pay $700 a month and get by."</TE>
<TE>   The oldest local, 105-year-old Etta Egeland, can recall when San
Juan Island was home only to hardy homesteaders such as her
grandparents.</TE>
<TE>   But she's not for barring the gates.</TE>
<TE>   "I never wanted to see so many people here that we look around
town and it's just filled up," she said. "But I'm one of those people
too. Everyone has a right to do what they want to do."</TE>
<TE>   Schechter sees the San Juans moving with other PEAS into a
"post-tourist" economy, where most local income is from pensions,
investments and professional services performed elsewhere. San Juan
County tops PEAS with 60% of its income in those categories.</TE>
<TE>   But although such a shift can ease tourism-related pressures, it
does little to make housing affordable for wage earners.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm concerned about it," said recent retiree Salquist. "Hey, if
you want good restaurants and you want local services, you have to
have an affordable place for people to live."</TE>

<LD>The sympathetic portrayal of 13 Palestinian terrorists and 26 armed
militants in the Church of the Nativity was quite bizarre ('Bringing
Bethlehem Home,' photographs by Carolyn Cole, text by Eric Pape, June
16). The photos and accompanying text lacked context and presented the
Palestinians as virtual bystanders in a 'City of Peace,' minimizing the
fact that they are individuals with the blood of innocent Israeli
civilians on their hands.</LD>
<LD>   Let's put this story in the proper context. The Palestinian
'militants' glorified in the article are terrorists. To avoid arrest,
they entered the Church of the Nativity, using it as a firing position
and its monks, nuns and other civilian hostages as human shields. Despite
this, the Israel Defense Forces never entered the church compound. Out of
concern for the sanctity of the site, they negotiated from the start. The
Palestinians not only endangered the lives of the civilians they took
hostage but also were behind the planning of countless terrorist attacks
against Israeli civilians and neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   Should this not have been an integral part of the story? Should not
some mention have been made that the people described in the piece had
stockpiled vast reserves of illegal weapons in the church, including hand
grenades, bullets and rifles? The necessity to tell a complete story
requires that these details be included in any discussion of the
terrorists.</LD>

<TE>   Your cover story was amazing. The photography was haunting, and I was
touched deeply by the surprising sweetness and youth of the faces. I am
sure the feature will cause a firestorm of criticism, but I am glad you
took the chance.</TE>
<TE>   On a visceral level, more poignant than the story, was the sense of
divine presence that emanated from the interior of the church. I don't
know how this sacred presence moved from the pages of the paper and into
my soul, but it did. If I find myself in need of a reminder that all
conflicts involve human beings, I will only need to close my eyes and
remember Bethlehem.</TE>

<TE>   This is a gem, a timely evocation of spiritual undertones in the

maelstrom of conflict and war. I am grateful that Cole outraced soldiers,
had the guts to remain in the church during the siege, and gave us this
legacy of journalism at its finest.</TE>

<TE>   I was mesmerized by Cole's powerful photographs. Two days later,
however, I was jolted back to reality when a Palestinian suicide bomber
blew up a civilian bus, killing 19 innocent Israelis and injuring 55
others. The next day, another Palestinian blew himself up, taking seven
more innocent lives. I couldn't help but think of all those beautifully
photographed men in the church who are alive today, no doubt cheering the
actions of their fellow brethren who have once again furthered 'the
cause.'</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As a former Bay Area resident, I applaud your publication of Gary
Rivlin's article on U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee ('Looking-Glass Politics,' June
16). A representative's job is just that-to represent his or her
district. Lee does that without compromise. All districts should be so
lucky to be listened to as intently as she listens to hers.</LD>
<LD>   Rose Reis-Jackson</LD>
<LD>   Via the Internet</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rivlin's piece paints a picture of a deeply disturbed and deluded
woman in symbiosis with a deeply disturbed and deluded community, the 9th
Congressional District. To use the term 'anti-American' to describe Lee
and her constituents is to employ a misnomer, for both are probably too
ideologically ill to recognize the treasonous nature of her position on
the 9/11 attacks. The terms 'dissent' or 'protest' also do not capture
the mind-set of Lee and her supporters, for there is nothing earnest or
loyal in her opposition to military measures against Al Qaeda and the
Taliban or other groups that would seek to unleash terror on the U.S.</TE>

<LD>The ever-handsome Dylan McDermott is pitching the
telecommunications services of Cellular South. He's in a superb room
adorned by 50-foot-long wooden beams, dark leather chairs, rustic pine
cabinets and light fixtures of haunting Indian designs. It's an
outdoorsman's dream suite, born in 1928 when novelist Zane Grey handed
his wife $55,000 and said of the wing he wanted her to build, "If I like
it, I'll keep it, if I don't, I'll tear it down." It still stands, and
the Cellular South ad is the first in what fans of the Grey house in
Altadena hope will be a new career as a commercial and film location for
a building inspired by a fire, embellished by Grey and almost destroyed
by his son.</LD>
<TE>   Edith Norton Woodward narrowly survived the Iroquois Theater fire in
Chicago in 1903; 602 playgoers did not. The doors to the theater opened
inward, a mistake the socialite would not repeat when she hired renowned
Pasadena architect Myron Hunt in 1907 to build her home in the hills
above Pasadena. Not only do the original doors open outward but the house
is entirely constructed of concrete. Thirteen years later the Woodward
family returned to Chicago, and the house was sold to Grey, whose "Riders
of the Purple Sage" and other romantic cowboy yarns would bring him the
sort of popularity accorded period heroes Seabiscuit and Babe Ruth. Fans
would line up outside the house, prompting Grey to add a third story so
that he could not be watched. On the terrace behind the new chambers, he
installed a rowing machine from which he could see Santa Catalina Island,
where he owned an adobe.</TE>
<TE>   Today the house relies on the kindness of Rose Jane Rudicel, a
fine-boned daughter of Italian immigrants who purchased it from Grey's
son Romer. Success eluded Grey's eldest child, an erstwhile writer and
hopeless investor who sold the house in 1970, says Matthew Berkley,
Rudicel's property manager and one of two renters in the eight-bedroom,
19,000-square-foot house. Rudicel and her husband, Charles, slowly
brought the house back from purgatory; in the first year alone, they tore
down 60 tons of ivy smothering the exterior. Many features were intact,
including wall paintings of Indian figures by Lillian Wilhelm Smith, who,
along with Frederic Remington, was the primary illustrator of Grey's
books.</TE>
<TE>   Only the kitchen was significantly altered, and it's there that the
heavy work goes on for the private parties, weddings and fund-raisers for
which the house is rented. Most of the catering is done by Rose Jane,
who, at age 69, reinvented herself as a chef, establishing The Press
vegetarian restaurant in Claremont. But then Grey himself knew a lot
about second chances-before the consummate Westerner became a novelist,
he had been a doctor, not of lonesome cowboys, but of dentistry.</TE>

<LD>As one of a handful of women in major-league baseball management,
Kim Ng is living her wildest dream. Vice president and assistant general
manager for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Ng, 33, was hired in December by the
team's general manager, Dan Evans, whom she knew when she worked for the
Chicago White Sox from 1990-96. Ng moved to town from New York, where she
spent four years as assistant general manager for the Yankees. We asked
for a conference on the mound.</LD>
<LD>   Women don't often go into pro baseball. Why did you?</LD>
<LD>   I was exposed to sports when I was young. I grew up the oldest of five
girls. My family is Chinese, and I was raised by my mom and my
grandmother. My dad died when I was 11. I come from a long line of very
strong women. It's in the blood. I played varsity softball at the
University of Chicago. [Ng was voted most valuable player as a senior.]
The stereotype of women in sports is that they aren't tough enough, and
they don't know the game.</LD>
<TE>   You have a strong background in transaction rules and payroll matters.
How did you learn your skills?</TE>
<TE>   In college I studied economics and public policy. My parents thought
I'd go into the financial world. My dad was a financial analyst, my mom a
banker. But when I graduated from college, I couldn't get a job in the
financial world. Thank goodness. A coach told me about an internship with
the White Sox. It paid $750 a month. I was thrilled.</TE>
<TE>   During the baseball season, you are known to work 90-hour work weeks.
What is your role?  My first big task was negotiations. Then I worked on
reorganizing the salary structure, taking a look at the day-to-day
operation. Not revamping it. Tweaking it. I manage the daily operations,
such as monitoring budgets and payroll and tracking our player
development system.</TE>
<TE>   What do you like best about your job?</TE>
<TE>   It's fun. I love coming to the ballpark to work. I like that there are
wins and losses at the end of the day. There's always room to improve.
You never stop trying. I'm interested in sports in general-what motivates
people, how to get someone to perform at their absolute peak of
consistency.</TE>
<TE>   What makes the culture of baseball and its players unique among the
various professional sports?</TE>
<TE>   They are fun-loving. Baseball is about respect. That's the unwritten
code. You hit a home run and you don't gaze out at the fans. You're
supposed to trot down the line. You don't see anything like touchdown
dances. It's the opposite of showing up the other guy. It's about
humility.</TE>
<TE>   Is your husband [a freelance writer and editor] a fan?</TE>
<TE>   No. We've been married five years and he does come to games
occasionally. But if I weren't here, he probably wouldn't go.</TE>
<TE>   Who are the people in sports you most admire?</TE>
<TE>   Martina Navratilova, because she changed the game of tennis and she
did what she did for so long. She changed the way women athletes are
perceived. Because of her, people saw how developed a woman athlete could
be physically, mentally, personally. She took a lot of heat. She made it
OK for women to be the best they can be physically.</TE>

Eddy Hemaratanatorn recently threw a party celebrating Pak Mann's 20th
anniversary and induction into the International Registry of Historic
Video Game &amp; Pinball Arcades-a significant milestone, considering that
nearby residents have tried to close the venue. Die-hard gamers showed up

<TE>   What makes a game classic?</TE>
<TE>   It's a crystallization of a defining aesthetic. In other words, it
should have a certain look that is instantly recognizable.</TE>
<TE>   If Pac-Man had a personality, what would he be like?</TE>
<TE>   God-like. He was everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Ms. Pac-Man versus Lara Croft?</TE>
<TE>   Let's put it this way. A movie about Ms. Pac would star Farrah Fawcett
and be a much better picture.</TE>

<TE>   Favorite old-school game?</TE>
<TE>   Ms. Pac-Man. I get into a Zen-like mode when I play.</TE>
<TE>   Memorable arcade moment?</TE>
<TE>   My parents used to own a Numero Uno pizza store, and we always had a
couple of arcade games. I would play for hours. People watched me in awe.
That was pretty gratifying.</TE>
<TE>   Coolest game character ever?</TE>
<TE>   I love the ships in R-Type. They're designed really beautifully.</TE>
<TE>   Your best trick ?</TE>
<TE>   In Ms. Pac-Man, if you get to a certain score, there's a place where
you can hide and the ghosts can't see you.</TE>
<TE>   Biggest video game challenge  you've faced?</TE>
<TE>   I used to play Street Fighter 2 against all the boys. It was tough
being the only girl. People can get pretty emotional.</TE>
<TE>   If Pac-Man had a personality, what would he be like?</TE>
<TE>   He's a family man. Remember the Pac-Man cartoon? He had Baby Pac-Man
and Ms. Pac-Man. It was a tight-knit family.</TE>
<TE>   Ms. Pac-Man versus Lara Croft?</TE>
<TE>   Lara Croft is all right, but Ms. Pac-Man is much more ladylike.</TE>

<TE>   Favorite old-school game?</TE>
<TE>   Asteroids. It got me addicted to spaceship games.</TE>
<TE>   Memorable arcade moment?</TE>
<TE>   In high school, I came to this very arcade and passed [survived to the
toughest level of] Asteroids. It was one of [my] highest scores.</TE>
<TE>   Coolest game character ever?</TE>
<TE>   Pac-Man. He's been around forever.</TE>
<TE>   Your best trick?</TE>
<TE>   Know when to give up, or you'll just get really frustrated.</TE>
<TE>   How far has one quarter taken you?</TE>
<TE>   I had an Atari when I was younger, so I didn't need a lot of quarters.</TE>
<TE>   What makes a game classic?</TE>
<TE>   Classics like Asteroids and Centipede are unique. Nowadays, the gaming
industry is turning out so many games it's hard to tell one from the
other sometimes.</TE>
<TE>   If Pac-Man had a personality, what would he be like?</TE>
<TE>   He kicks some serious butt.</TE>
<TE>   Ms. Pac-Man versus Lara Croft?</TE>
<TE>   Ms. Pac-Man. Lara Croft is just a passing fad. Someone newer will
replace her.</TE>

<HD>Cutting Remarks: A 'Salon' in More Ways Than One</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WOLLOCK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Today's beauty salons, bastions of faux blonds poring over the
pages of Cosmo in search of their next 'do, bear little resemblance to
the traditional art salons of Europe. But the owner of Burbank's Wax
Poetic aims to change all that. In addition to offering haircuts, waxing
and facials, Kerry Hite's funky lavender-purple-mint green shop doubles
as a gallery, hosting bimonthly shows by local photographers and painters
who Hite feels will 'inspire dialogue.'</LD>
<LD>   The envelope-pushing extends to Hite's personal style. With her white
porcelain skin and fire-engine-red lips framed by two-tone hair, she's
part retro glam-our, part edgy 'Matrix'-era cool. Likewise, Hite says,
her customers (mostly ani-mators, painters, music industry types, Goth
scenesters and fetishists from adjacent NoHo or nearby Hollywood) want
hairstyles that are unique. 'Blond, tan, soft and pretty isn't really our
aesthetic. Our customers come here because they don't want to look like
everybody else.'</LD>
<LD>   In fact, everything at Wax Poetic is just a few hairs left of center.
Instead of reading the usual fashion magazines (which Hite calls
'vapid'), customers can peruse a small library of books while waiting
their turn-everything from Spalding Gray to texts on the occult. The
midweek 'Cocktail &amp; a Cut' promotion offers an adult beverage with every
snip.</LD>
<TE>   Hite, 33, did facials in other salons for six years before tapping her
savings and maxing out three credit cards to open Wax Poetic in 2000.
Currently employing three stylists, she knows she could increase volume
by replacing the gallery with more hair stations. But she insists the art
is what makes her salon a cut above the rest. 'People look at the work
and say, 'You know, I really want to get back into photography,' or, 'I
used to paint, I should try that again.' And that's really cool.'</TE>

<LD>'Eccentric' doesn't begin to describe Magic Cat, Michiko
Kishimoto's 4-year-old shop in Little Tokyo. Along with nearly every
conceivable cat collectible under the sun, the 67-year-old proprietor
also stocks Elvis memorabilia and Kurosawa videos because, well, she can.</LD>
<LD>   Granted, the two entertainers had cat-related nicknames (Elvis was
often referred to as the 'Hillbilly Cat,' while she says some called
director Akira Kurosawa 'Kool Kat'). But, bottom line, the inventory at
Magic Cat is a reflection of Kishimoto's idiosyncratic tastes. She
handpicks everything for the store, down to the Kurosawa films on DVD and
the 'Elvisopoly' board game. 'The King is my favorite,' Kishimoto says.
'I still think he's alive somewhere!'</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, cat merchandise is her bread and butter. Thousands of
knick-knacks are shoehorned into the tiny shop: kitschy T-shirts, rare
woodblock prints, lucky Japanese cat statues, Felix magnets, Tom and
Jerry postcards, you name it.</LD>
<TE>   One famous feline is noticeably absent, however-Sanrio's Hello Kitty.
'I won't carry any Hello Kitty things,' says Kishimoto, who started
accumulating cat trinkets as a teenager. 'Everyone has it already. What's
the fun in that?'</TE>
<TE>   Before setting up shop, Kishimoto and her exhaustive collection had
been on the road for nearly 30 years, doing business at pet shows all
over the West; she still loads up her van every few weeks for shows in
Southern California. Shortly after opening Magic Cat-and at an age when
many folks are thinking about how to spend their retirement days-she took
a computer class at a local church and commissioned an e-commerce site.</TE>
<TE>   Kishimoto has fancied cats for as long as she can remember. In fact,
her earliest baby picture showcases Kishimoto in a stroller next to the
family cat in San Onofre. She currently lives in Boyle Heights with a
black tabby named (what else?) Elvis Jr. (Elvis Sr. died about four years
ago). 'I don't make a lot of money,' Kishimoto says, 'but I'm happy when
[customers bring their] cats to my booth.'</TE>

<HD>Barbecue Prescription</HD>
<DH>When It Comes to 'Cue, the Rib Doctor Has the Chops</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SONDRA FARRELL BAZROD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Where there's smoke, there's fire-and you might also look for the
Rib Doctor. That would be Hayward Harris Jr. of Riverside, whose prowess
is legendary in the sizzling milieu of barbecue competitions. From Shake,
Rattle &amp; Smoke (Azusa) to the Six-Shooter Smoke-Off (Tucson), Harris and
his wife, Eva, are champions in hotly contested categories such as Best
Brisket at competitions all over the country.</LD>
<LD>   There's also the World Series of pit, grill and smoker: the annual
American Royal Barbecue Contest in Kansas City, Mo., officiated by the
Kansas City Barbecue Society, for which Harris is a judge. The contest
typically hosts 360 to 380 teams, scored on their chicken, ribs, pork
shoulder and brisket. Harris, 51, first encountered the group more than a
decade ago at a National Barbecue Assn. event. 'They made it sound like
they walked on water,' he recalls of the Kansas contingent. 'I said I was
pretty good, too. They ate my ribs. No one spoke to me again. I went home
dejected and didn't hear anything until August, when the president asked
me to judge the American Royal.'</LD>
<TE>   Harris started barbecuing at age '5 or 6' while growing up in Compton.
He would start the fires for his dad's holiday barbecuing, which began at
7 a.m. He got serious about barbecue in 1979 after graduating from UCLA
with a degree in political science and moving to Rialto, where he read of
a renowned barbecue restaurant in San Bernardino. 'I was ready to feast,
and it was the worst I ever had in my life,' he says. Harris then bought
some 55-gallon barrel oil drums from a friend and never looked back.
'Those were the Rolls-Royce of barbecue pits,' he says of the homemade
cookers. 'They are called 'soul buckets,' and I still have them.' Harris
used the drums until 1991, when he joined the National Barbecue Assn. and
bought his first commercial pit. He started barbecuing commercially in
1989.</TE>
<TE>   Harris was already barbecuing when he met Eva. 'She challenged me,' he
says. 'She said she was the best barbecuer around and invited me to her
chicken wings barbecue, but I wasn't impressed. When she tasted my spare
ribs, she admitted it was like night and day.' Eva gifted Harris with Big
Bertha, his deluxe indirect-cooking, Texas-style pit. At
competitions,where prizes can run into thousands of dollars, the Harrises
take turns at the pit for all-night marathons. A Harris brisket, for
example, cooks for 18 or 19 hours. 'When it's finished, it just melts in
your mouth,' Harris says. 'When barbecuing, slower is better.'</TE>
<TE>   The Harrises compete under the aegis of their catering company, the
Rib Doctor. The Rib Doctor once catered at the Rio Casino in Las Vegas,
and for one wedding anniversary party, Harris wore a tuxedo while
barbecuing. The Harrises have also appeared on a TV commercial for KC
Masterpiece Barbecue Sauce. (Speaking of which, Harris says his own
meticulously perfected sauce features 'about 14 ingredients' and is due
on the market soon.)</TE>
<TE>   A purist who eschews gas grills, 'ceramic bricks don't give flavor,"
Harris advises barbecuers to buy quality meat, get to know the local
butcher and keep a good instant-read thermometer handy. For flavor, he
recommends a 'rub,' blending seasonings and sauce-but the most important
ingredient, Harris insists, is the joy of the thing. 'There are no rules
in barbecue. The most important thing is to have fun.'</TE>

<HD>The Advantage of Falling Short</HD>
<HD>Investors, Engineers, Scientists and Sports Performance Experts Are
Turning Their Attention to Failure--and How Reactions to It Often
Determine Future Success</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena had never failed so
spectacularly. In late 1999, two spacecraft sent to explore Mars suddenly
vanished when they reached the planet. The first headed to the dark side
and disappeared. The second reached its destination in fine shape, but it
stopped sending signals as it approached the rocky surface.</LD>
<LD>   The immediate price of the two debacles included the $360 million
invested in the missions and a big slice of JPL's pride. But in the
months that followed, the intangible cost, in terms of low morale, seemed
to grow ever larger. The leafy JPL campus in the foothills of the San
Gabriel Mountains became even more quiet. The chill also spread through
the nation's small community of deep space explorers, as engineers and
scientists were transferred, demoted or left for other jobs. "It was a
bleak period," recalls David Spencer, who was responsible for making a
success of the next Mars flight-named Odyssey. A boyish 36-year-old with
short blond hair and blue eyes, Spencer has spent much of his adult life
in pursuit of the heavens. His career at JPL, where he has specialized in
the mechanics of flight, had been marked by one success after another.
"We hadn't had a major failure in decades and here we had them back to
back. There were some pretty heated conflicts over what happened, a lot
of finger pointing and accusations."</LD>
<TE>   The Odyssey mission became the focus of the lab's desperate effort to
recover both the public's trust and, more important, its image as
competent and successful. "A failure would have threatened planetary
exploration," he says. He expected added pressure and accepted extra eyes
peering over his shoulder. But he had never imagined that his colleagues
would become so grimly obsessive.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst was when I went to Denver for a meeting, even though I was
very sick. I ran into one of our guys at the airport and he started
grilling me right there in the gate area. Then when I fell asleep on the
plane, he woke me up and started asking me questions. 'What if this
happens?' 'What if that happens?' I thought he was going off the deep
end."</TE>
<TE>   But in going off the deep end, JPL's engineers eventually discovered
the likely reasons for the two disappearances-the technical causes as
well as a dysfunctional work culture that contributed to the errors.
Along the way, they also learned a lesson they had not expected. JPL's
shame, recrimination and eventual recovery taught them how people and
organizations respond to failure, one of the most valuable and
least-talked-about human experiences.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, however, the subject of failure has captured the attention of
sociologists, investors, engineers, scientists and sports performance
experts. Their purpose is to find clues into why failure occurs and how
reactions to it determine future success.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything relates to failure," says Henry Petroski, a professor of
civil engineering and history at Duke University in North Carolina. "We
grow up experiencing failure as children and then we go through it as
adults. The key is understanding that failure is how we improve. You do
this not by ignoring the failure, but by recognizing it, examining it
thoroughly and not making any changes until you truly understand it."
Companies, government agencies and even entire professions can learn from
failure in the same way, Petroski adds. Civil engineers, for example,
have analyzed catastrophes and integrated lessons learned over time into
the design and construction of future projects.</TE>
<TE>   WHILE EXPERTS SUCH AS PETROSKI LABOR TO DISSECT THE DYNAMICS OF
failure, the rest of us know that human disasters are innately
fascinating. "There is a certain staring-at-the-car-wreck aspect to the
curiosity people have about failure," notes Jason Zasky. "And there may
be some Schadenfreude, you know, a pleasurable feeling people get over
someone else's disaster. But mostly there's this realization that some
people who have great failures ultimately succeed. It doesn't always
happen. But we see that people fail because they are willing to take
risks, and those are the people who often achieve something."</TE>
<TE>   Zasky should know. In July 2000 he founded an Internet-based magazine
called Failure, which publishes articles on debacles as well-known as the
Edsel and as obscure as the Jadis, a hybrid tea rose that was a
commercial flop because people didn't like the name. After early
struggles, Failuremag.com became one of those rarities in cyberspace: a
Web site that didn't fail, and even became profitable. Its success
reflects a certain respect for the subject of failure and, perhaps, a new
sophistication about the phenomenon itself.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we're like Japan, where failure is always a dirty
word," Zasky says. "Here people sometimes see it almost as a matter of
pride, that they at least tried. And I think there's a fascination with
how some people fail, but don't give up, and the next time really
succeed."</TE>
<TE>   This phenomenon, of the failure who resurrects himself in spectacular
fashion, was formally documented in 1938. German psychologist Sara
Jucknat reported that people who fail at something they deem vital to
their identity will often set an even higher goal the next time. Their
hope is that they can erase the failure with an impressive success. Along
the way they prove to themselves, and perhaps the outside world, that
they are, in fact, competent.</TE>
<TE>   Though Jucknat's seminal study made the dynamics of success and
failure a hot topic for a decade or so, interest cooled. It was revived
in the 1970s and '80s by researchers who preferred to study human
strengths rather than pathologies. Martin Seligman is a psychologist at
the University of Pennsylvania and a pioneer in studying how people cope
successfully with adversity. His writings on "learned optimism" became
classics in this field and inspired dozens of academics to begin looking
at the positive qualities that help certain people rise above hard times.
They found that those who turn failure into advantage share a handful of
characteristics:</TE>
<TE>   They possess the analytical skills to take apart a fiasco and
understand it well enough to make changes, says George Vaillant, director
of the Study of Adult Development at Harvard Medical School. Vaillant has
seen people develop this trait and use it to create successes, even late
in life.</TE>
<TE>   They have "the capacity to form meaningful relationships," Vaillant
says. "These people can metabolize others-taking in what they have to
teach-rather than being oblivious. These are the ones who find mentors
throughout their lives. They have the ability to find meaning in what
happens to them."</TE>
<TE>   They also have the ability to be realistic, rather than undyingly
optimistic, in the face of crises. Business management guru James
Collins, author of the recent best-selling book "Good to Great," says
this point was brought home vividly during an interview he conducted with
a Vietnam War prisoner, a retired naval officer. Realists succeed under
the worst conditions, the officer said, while optimists "died of broken
hearts."</TE>
<TE>    AS WITH EVERY ASPECT OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR, GENETICS AND
ENVIRONMENT-nature and nurture-play significant roles. Indeed, children
seem to develop what psychologist Salvatore Maddi calls "hardiness" at a
very early age. Maddi, a professor at UC Irvine, conducted a pioneering
study of this trait, following 450 middle managers at Illinois Bell
Telephone through the upheaval that came with deregulation of their
industry. Many lost their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "Two-thirds of the sample fell apart," Maddi says. "There was
violence, strokes, suicides, depression. But one-third not only survived,
but thrived." Among those who did well, Maddi found a great many had been
raised in more stressful family conditions and had endured more
hardships. "They had also been nominated as the 'hope of the future for
the family,' and they had accepted the role."</TE>
<TE>   The people who didn't fare as well were those who had the most stable,
even happy, upbringings. "The important part may have been that they were
never selected to show competence, and so they didn't have this belief
that they were going to have it when they needed it." For those people
who weren't blessed with a stressful childhood, however, there is hope.
Maddi insists that they can learn hardiness, even later in life. He
teaches these skills at a consulting company in Newport Beach called The
Hardiness Institute.</TE>
<TE>   In general, Maddi instructs people to assess their failures coolly and
accept responsibility where necessary. He then encourages them to
identify real action they can take to recover, and to develop
relationships with people who can offer support and guidance. Barring
some deeper psychological problem, he says, "These skills can be grafted
onto a person, and it is not a long, drawn-out process."</TE>
<TE>   Maddi, Vaillant and others have data to show that people can learn
resilience and learn how to overcome personal failure, even very late in
life. However, matters are more complicated when failure occurs in a
public arena. Athletes are especially subject to this because any time
sport anoints a winner, there are always equal, or greater, numbers of
losers. It makes sense, then, that much of what is known about the
psychological dynamics of public failure comes from those who observe
athletes.</TE>
<TE>   David Conroy and his colleagues study performance at the sports
psychology laboratory of Pennsylvania State University. One of their
recent findings debunks a myth about what is commonly called the "fear of
failure." Many of us believe that fear of failure must be banished before
success can be achieved. It turns out that this kind of fear is not as
destructive as we might assume. Indeed, while sports gear marketers
preach "No Fear" to the masses, a more sophisticated message might be "A
Little Fear Is a Good Thing."</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is, fear of failure can lead you to your best
achievements," Conroy says. "This is especially true of
performers-athletes, actors, musicians and so on-whose livelihoods depend
solely on their talents."</TE>
<TE>   Anxiety about an uncertain future can make people focus and try very
hard. Fear is only a problem when it grows so big it becomes a
distraction. This can happen when you load too much hope onto the outcome
of a single game, or even a single season.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked with a high school tennis player who was having problems
that we couldn't quite get to the bottom of," Conroy says. "We finally
realized what it was when he explained that he was desperate to do well
in his junior and senior years because he wanted to go to college, but
knew his family couldn't afford it unless he got a scholarship for his
tennis. He did all right and got what he wanted, but it was a struggle."</TE>
<TE>   Conroy's tennis player illustrates another core truth about failure.
The problem isn't the defeat we might suffer, but rather, its
consequences. "Failure itself is meaningless, but if we believe that
failure means we'll be denied something very important, like an
education, then it takes on more meaning."</TE>
<TE>   Resilient tennis players, for example, understand that every
tournament is a "failure" for every player except the champion. So they
judge their performances more broadly, looking at how well they played
each match, how much effort they expended and whether certain aspects of
their game- serve, backhand, net play and so on-showed improvement. Any
player who defines every performance that falls short of the championship
as a failure puts a destructive level of pressure on themselves. Worse
off are those who take the next step and allow failure to determine their
entire sense of self. This is when a loss in some competition turns an
athlete into a loser in life.</TE>
<TE>   "In sports, people often learn from parents, coaches and siblings that
affection and attention are based on success," Conroy says. Even parents
who emphasize effort over results may inadvertently communicate a
different set of values when victories are always followed by trips to
the ice cream parlor and defeats mean going straight home.</TE>
<TE>   As a practical matter, Conroy suggests that parents dole out treats in
a way that breaks the relationship between winning and rewards. "Grab an
ice cream when you lose sometimes, and pass it by sometimes after you
win."</TE>
<TE>   Conroy argues that failure is so much a part of life that it should be
considered normal in a life well-lived. The hordes of unemployed
high-tech workers seem to share this idea. Pink slip parties and
Internet-based communities for the suddenly dismissed have eased the
shame in these industries by bringing failure out of the closet.</TE>
<TE>   Carlotta Stankiewicz of San Antonio responded to losing her job at an
ad agency by starting a Web site called Planetpinkslip.com. Serving a
group she calls "income challenged" was not the best strategy for making
money, but as she connected with an ever-wider number of refugees from
failed companies, she began to see that her being among those chosen for
downsizing was a failure that didn't define her.</TE>
<TE>   "I had been a straight-A student, president of my high school class,
and I had gotten every job I ever applied for," says Stankiewicz, 37. "I
valued achievement, success very much, and I had very little experience
with failure." When she lost access to the praise and attention she
received on the job, Stankiewicz was forced to find rewards elsewhere.
She discovered them in her home life, in her Web site and in her new work
as a freelance writer. So far, she says, no prospective clients have been
discouraged by her job loss.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost a cool thing, in certain industries, to have been part of
a failed company or a downsizing," Stankiewicz says. "It's a sign that
you were willing to take a risk in the first place. People respect that
you were brave enough to try."</TE>
<TE>   Even lenders and government agencies extend respect to once-failed
entrepreneurs who come back with a new idea. Matt Bergheiser, who
recruits businesses for the city of Trenton, N.J., says that failure no
longer leaves an indelible mark of defeat. "Failure has become recognized
as part of the normal cycle, especially for small business," says
Bergheiser, who arranges financing and subsidizes real estate for
start-ups. What's important is whether an entrepreneur has learned from
failure. "If they see how they could do it better, that's a good sign.
But if they just blame others, or the economy, then they haven't
benefited from the failure they experienced."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the benefits of failure are not recognized as an asset in
every business in every part of the country. In high-tech regions on the
two coasts, it's relatively easy to rebound from a major defeat. Yet in
more traditional businesses and less entrepreneurial environments, the
taint of a bankruptcy, or firing, can be more poisonous to the future.
Certain individuals may also feel the shame of failure more keenly.
Bergheiser recalls a businessman in Philadelphia as an example of the
paralyzing shame that many people feel after a big flop.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy's company went out of business, but he didn't tell anyone in
his family. Every day he got up, got dressed and left like he was going
to work. Instead he just sort of wandered around. This went on for months
before he was finally honest with them. When he was, they accepted it.
They still loved him."</TE>
<TE>   A recent entry in the annals of failure research points to a pesky and
subtle kind of defeat that can darken our mood and undermine progress
without our ever knowing. It's subconscious failure.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of experiments, psychologist Tanya Chartrand has found
that most of us harbor subconscious hopes and aspirations, and that we
feel bad when we don't realize them. "You can have a general,
non-conscious goal of pleasing every person you come in contact with,"
she says. "As you go through life, you are going to succeed at that and
fail with different people. The failures are understood at a level we
aren't aware of, but they affect us."</TE>
<TE>   Chartrand, a professor at Ohio State University, found that student
subjects felt their mood darken when they were thwarted in the pursuit of
some unconscious need. In one experiment she also discovered that failure
to achieve an unconscious goal suppressed student performance in a test
involving verbal skills. Students who were unsuccessful in achieving an
unconscious goal in the first test did worse on the second test.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond such immediate effects, Chartrand suspects that we can suffer
repeated, even chronic, failure if we are blocked by unconscious needs
that are no longer useful. A good example of this is the person who is
promoted to a management position but continues to unconsciously seek
friendship and approval from everyone on the job.</TE>
<TE>   ALTHOUGH INDIVIDUALS MAY RELY ON FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO RECOVER from
defeat, some losses are harder to get over than others. Huge public
debacles can cause severe feelings of shame and guilt, especially if
great sums of money are lost or people die. In the rather close-knit
community of bridge builders, for example, it is generally accepted that
designers and engineers may suffer unexpected illness, even death, if one
of their creations collapses-as occurred after two of the biggest bridge
failures ever recorded: the Tacoma Narrows collapse of 1940 and the St.
Lawrence River collapse of 1907.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the enormous damage, Petroski points out that failures of
massive engineering projects have provided critical lessons in the
development of safer technologies. After the Tacoma Narrows bridge fell,
engineers began to consider aerodynamics in their designs, to accommodate
the wind pressures that caused the collapse. In the case of the 1907
Quebec disaster, a postmortem discovered that the method used, which
pushed the limits of design for cantilever bridges, had produced weak
members that couldn't hold up the load they were supposed to bear. The
design was abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   As another practical example of improvement via failure, Petroski
points to the Challenger disaster of 1986, which killed seven astronauts
when the shuttle's giant launch rocket exploded in the stratosphere. The
cause was a joint with a rubber seal ring that had contracted due to
unusually cold weather. "The first solution could have been redesigning
the joint," Petroski notes. "But that redesign could have produced new,
unexpected problems. It was more sensible to simply say, 'We won't launch
when it's that cold.' "</TE>
<TE>   In altering the launch-decision process, rather than the technology,
NASA came close to confirming the conclusions of sociologist Diane
Vaughan. For her book, "The Challenger Launch Decision," Vaughan reviewed
statements by everyone involved in the debate over whether to proceed
despite the cold that morning. She reached the startling conclusion that
it was not risk-taking that led to failure, but conformity. In fact,
given the ethos that existed at NASA, the truly risky move that morning
would have been to scrub the launch. In a sense, a momentary failure-a
suspended launch-was avoided, with catastrophic results.</TE>
<TE>   "The shuttle was experimental, and problems were considered a normal
part of things," Vaughan says. "The overall guideline was: Everything is
risky. We eliminate the risks we can and contain the ones we can't. When
you can't eliminate a risk, you calculate your margin of safety and go
ahead if it seems acceptable."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, little hard data was available about the rocket's
performance in cold weather. At the same time, NASA was under pressure to
conduct as many shuttle missions as possible, in part because commercial
payloads were covering the cost. Add the enormous public attention
created by the addition of an elementary school teacher to the crew, and
the agency felt a tremendous impetus to proceed. "There were some
concerns about the decision that couldn't be supported by data," Vaughan
adds. "But intuition didn't carry much weight at all in that situation."</TE>
<TE>   The repercussions from the Challenger failure went beyond the loss of
life and the damage to NASA's reputation. The institution benefited from
the investigations that followed. Among other changes, engineers were
given more power to stop a launch for safety's sake.</TE>
<TE>   But as so often happens within large organizations struck by big
public failures, many individuals suffered personally and did not get a
shot at real redemption. As the post-Challenger investigations pressed
forward, those who had been in the launch-control chain of command were
scrutinized, if not made into scapegoats. "People were punished," Vaughan
says. "They were pushed aside, sent for re-education. Lives were ruined.
Unfortunately, that's pretty typical with a failure this big in a system
this big. People pay a personal price."</TE>
<TE>   Although individuals and organizations generally react to failure in
similar ways, the firings and transfers of employees after Challenger
reveal a major difference. Individuals can forgive themselves, learn from
the mistakes and try again. But large organizations often have trouble
forgiving those responsible. It's as if the only way for them to heal and
move ahead is to first purge some employees, whether they are truly
responsible or are simply convenient targets. In the best cases, Vaughan
adds, leaders will also examine what might have gone wrong with the
organization as a whole, and its systems, but this doesn't always happen.</TE>
<TE>   WHEN JPL LOST ITS TWO MARS spacecraft, it and NASA conducted sweeping
investigations. In the case of the orbiter, the investigators discovered
that engineers had failed to convert English measures into metric. This
error sent the orbiter too close to the planet, where the friction of the
atmosphere burned it up. The error was compounded, adds engineer David
Spencer, by a JPL culture that dismissed the intuition of some veterans
who had expressed concerns about the orbiter's trajectory. When the data
didn't support those early warnings, the younger scientists who ran the
project dismissed them.</TE>
<TE>   The analysis of the second loss, that of the Mars Polar Lander,
concluded that the failure occurred on its descent to the surface. As
planned, the lander's legs deployed at an altitude of 1.5 kilometers. But
vibrations from the deployment apparently mimicked the shock of landing
and triggered a sensor on the footpad that shut down the craft's engine.
With no thrust to slow it down, the lander crashed.</TE>
<TE>   Engineers had not programmed the lander to account for the vibrations,
Spencer says. "For the future we would have to augment the design and we
would have to accept a Red Team [of other experts] to oversee our
mission. They punched holes in everything we did. It was not a pleasant
experience."</TE>
<TE>   It was far more pleasant, however, than the experiences of those who
were most involved in the failures of the lander and orbiter. Though
failure may have gained new respect in recent years, huge, politically
based bureaucracies that run on tax dollars still have trouble tolerating
big errors. "There was a mass exodus from Lockheed Martin," a key JPL
contractor, Spencer recalls. "But I'm not sure that's all for the best."
The departures "meant a great drain of experience and manpower. I think
that an engineer-a person, really-who has failed is worth much more,
because of what is learned from the experience, than one who has never
failed."</TE>
<TE>   Although the technical discoveries were valuable, Spencer came to
believe that the intellectual autopsies done on the two failed missions
yielded more important information about the culture at JPL. For
instance, he says, he was impressed during the reviews by the abilities
of the "graybeards" at JPL to use the backs of envelopes to figure things
out. Younger scientists who have always relied on computers don't have
those instincts.</TE>
<TE>   Excessive budget pressures and a failure to follow procedures also
were major culprits. "The team did not follow procedures when it came to
reporting problems, and never properly documented it for the project
managers. If they had, it would have been assigned to a team and it would
have been solved."</TE>
<TE>   With the Mars Odyssey, NASA abandoned its mantra of "faster, cheaper,"
and fully funded the mission, allocating nearly $300 million for the
project, almost as much as was spent to launch its two previous
spacecraft. "We also went back to the basics of reporting and following
procedures very closely," Spencer adds.</TE>
<TE>   Odyssey was launched in April 2001, reached the Red Planet in October
and recently began sending back data on the composition of its surface
and on radiation in its environment. "The team pulled together and
restored some of the rigor to the program," Spencer says. So far, Odyssey
is an unqualified scientific success. It has also become a textbook
example of a highly public failure and its profound effects on
individuals and institutions.</TE>

<HD>Seeking the Soul of Marin</HD>
<DH>John Walker Lindh Has Added to the Region's Reputation as a Place
Where Anything Goes. But Does California's Richest County Deserve Its
'Hottubistan' Label?</DH>

<LD>Tim the Hot Tub Repairman, a bit disoriented, shifts into park and
studies his map book. He is searching for an address in Novato, a
middle-class burg about 25 miles north of San Francisco. He swings a
U-turn and pulls up to a house that looks glum, its yard unkempt.</LD>
<LD>   Your correspondent is tagging along in search of the Marin County of
legend. Tracking a hot tub repairman seems a logical first step.</LD>
<LD>   This stop, however, feels like a detour.</LD>
<TE>   The unsmiling woman who answers the door may own a hot tub, but
otherwise nothing here says Marin. There is no way this woman was ever a
flower child or a yuppie, contrary species that somehow achieved harmonic
convergence in this mythic place. She has a big-screen TV in the living
room and a son named Bobby with an Eminem poster on his bedroom wall.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby looks about the same age as a certain Marin lad who recently
worked as a Taliban warrior. He leads Tim out back to the ailing spa
while his mother considers a question.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, sure, she knows how outsiders see Marin.</TE>
<TE>   "Hot tubs and peacock feathers and cocaine," she snarls. "And we're
all rich."</TE>
<TE>   And so what do you think?</TE>
<TE>   "Bull!"</TE>
<TE>   If some Marinites seem touchy these days, Tim offers a defense.
"They're nice people, real nice," he says of his clients. After Sept. 11,
he adds, he saw Old Glory all over the Northern California county, more
so than up in Santa Rosa, where he lives. That said, Marin will never be
confused with Middle America, especially now that John Walker Lindh has
added to its legend. Once the world learned that the "American Taliban"
began his strange odyssey in Marin, notorious for its do-your-own-thing
ethos, many people thought: "Aha, it figures."</TE>
<TE>   Lindh "was prepared for this seduction not just by the wispy
relativism of Marin County," Hoover Institution scholar Shelby Steele
wrote in the Wall Street Journal, "but also by a much broader post-'60s
cultural liberalism that gave his every step toward treason a feel of
authenticity and authority." Steele described Marin as a place "where all
the cliche obsessions of shallow California . . . flourish without
irony."</TE>
<TE>   Allusions to Marin's culpability, or lack thereof, have been a staple
of many articles and commentaries concerning Lindh. The online journal
Salon offered the headline: "Insta-Traitor: Just add hot-tub water and
stir." The razzing reached a presidential level when former President
George Bush piled on, describing Lindh in an interview as "some misguided
Marin County hot-tubber."</TE>
<TE>   But do these words reflect reality?</TE>
<TE>   There's no question that Marin is a touchy-feely, target-rich
environment. Where else have nature, spirituality, wealth and politics
blended in such a frothy organic frappe? Consider: Early this year,
opponents of a Sausalito bond measure for a new police and fire station
were victorious at the polls after citing faulty feng shui, among other
things. (Traffic was another concern, but that's not what made it a Marin
story.) Or this: Marin's hottest new restaurant is an elegantly appointed
vegan place called Roxanne's, with no ovens or grills and specializing in
"raw food cuisine." (With wine and tip, figure $100 for dinner for two;
reservations are strongly recommended.)</TE>
<TE>   Romantics see in Marin a storybook enchantment, blessed by the
eternal. Rising between ocean and bay, it's an emerald terrain of
mountain and valley, forest and meadow, kissed by a cool, wafting mist.
The standard threshold to this realm is the Golden Gate Bridge, in all
its grace and glory. Your correspondent opted for the side door, arriving
via the utilitarian Richmond-San Rafael Bridge on a showery morning-and
was greeted by sudden shafts of sunlight and a rainbow.</TE>
<TE>   The land's beauty has always cried out for protection and attracted
free spirits who have delighted in sensual pleasures and embraced a
back-to-nature lifestyle. And so it was in the 1960s that Marin gave
birth to a custom in which celebrants shed clothing and soak together in
steamy water in redwood tubs.</TE>
<TE>   The overheated, touchy-feely lifestyle was served up in Cyra
McFadden's "The Serial: A Year in the Life of Marin County," the
bestselling 1977 novel that introduced the region's mystical yet
materialistic manners to the American public. McFadden's deadpan parody
delighted readers when it first appeared in installments in Marin's
weekly Pacific Sun. If not recognizing themselves, they certainly
recognized neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Marin was not delighted, however, when NBC aired a documentary in 1978
titled "I Want It All Now," which, as Pacific Sun publisher Steve
McNamara later described it, "made it appear that Marin was largely
populated by loathsome brats of all ages who lounged in hot tubs and
stroked each other with peacock feathers."</TE>
<TE>   The Sun did an expose on the expose, branding it a "docudrama" with
staged scenes. A media watchdog group censured the show as
"journalistically flawed at essential points," but Marin's legend was
secured.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, former President Bush apologized for his swipe at
Marin-after the daily Marin Independent Journal published readers'
reactions. But for some locals, what Bush the elder said mattered less
than how he said it. "He called it MARE-in," says Bob Canepa, president
of Mill Valley Market, a family-owned Marin institution abounding in
gourmet and organic specialties. Canepa, a Republican, sighs as he
explains how Marin's reputation for self-indulgent flakiness was just
starting to fade. A Marinite his whole life, Canepa also served in the
Marine Corps and was president of the local Rotary Club and a Cub Scout
cubmaster. The market sponsors Little League teams.</TE>
<TE>   And what's so bad about hot tubs, anyway?</TE>
<TE>   "I have a hot tub," Canepa says. "I use it for my back. I have a bad
back from years of lifting groceries." Cartoonist Phil Frank of the San
Francisco Chronicle reacted to the former president's crack by
dispatching him on a recon mission into "the alien landscape of
Hottubistan," where he meets a contact named Pilates.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you want to know about?" Pilates asks. "Crystal healers,
aromatherapy, channelers, inner-child rebirthing? You name it."</TE>
<TE>   It's striking how Marin, statistically, lives up to its stereotype:
white, wealthy, well-educated and liberal. According to the 2000 census,
the county's population is 247,289, mostly concentrated in 11 towns. Much
of the county's 520 square miles is shielded from development, as
parkland or agricultural preserve. For all of the dramatic demographic
changes that America and California have undergone since the 1960s, Marin
has grown slowly and changed little. It is the richest of California's 58
counties, with a per capita income of nearly $58,000. The average price
of Marin homes sold in May was $944,000.</TE>
<TE>   The slow pace of change means that Marin has more gray hairs per
capita, with a median age of 41.3 years, compared to 33.3 statewide. As
for politics, the county that launched liberal Sen. Barbara Boxer gave
the current President Bush 28.6% of its vote, compared to 64.7% for Al
Gore and a relatively hearty 6.7% for the Green Party's Ralph Nader.</TE>
<TE>   The census doesn't count spas, but Tim the Hot Tub Repairman is not
hurting for business. His morning appointments complete, we return to the
San Rafael showroom of California Cooperage. A few customers meander
about, inspecting sleek Coleman acrylic tubs with bucket seats and
whirlpool jets. California Cooperage used to make only redwood tubs, says
owner Theresa Bonagofski, but that changed with the times and new
technology.</TE>
<TE>   She explains that the company's founders launched the business in the
early 1970s by placing an ad in Playboy that attracted steady orders. Hot
tubbing was sexy. When she bought the business 16 years ago, "it was
still the party thing to do. You'd put in a hot tub and throw a party,
and you'd be the No. 1 guy on the block." But nowadays, she says, people
just want to relax and relieve stress-one reason there are now hot tub
outlets in Middle America.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the spa showroom, two Marin hot-tubbers-an elderly woman and
her middle-aged son-sniff aromatherapy samples. They select the Being
collection with four fragrances: Awaken, Release, Enlighten and Reflect.
The son shrugs: "It helps mask the smell of the chlorine."</TE>
<TE>   This doesn't seem the right Marin either. Your correspondent,
frustrated, heads for the library in search of clues.</TE>
<TE>   The library is located at the Marin County Civic Center, an
earth-toned complex lounging amid the rolling terrain of San Rafael. This
proves a revelation in itself. A historic marker explains that it was one
of Frank Lloyd Wright's last commissions; the great architect said his
plan was for the structures "to melt into the sunburnt hills."</TE>
<TE>   Today it seems that Marin could have embraced no one but Wright, the
champion of "organic architecture." But the 1961 groundbreaking was a
political turning point, old-timers say, a triumph of progressives
against an old guard that figured there was no reason to spend taxpayers'
money on a fancy out-of-town architect for something as mundane as
government offices.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the library, Marin's heritage unfolds. While San Francisco
boomed, Marin's terrain shielded it from development. California's dairy
industry started in Point Reyes. Cattle were ranched and loggers took to
the forest. A fishing village took shape in Sausalito and market towns
served the farm economy. But even in the 19th century, Marin's beauty
cried out for preservation. After the turn of the century, when loggers
and later a dam threatened a canyon of old-growth redwoods, Republican
Congressman William Kent bought the property and donated some of the land
to the federal government. Shortly after, President Theodore Roosevelt
declared it a national monument, thereby creating Muir Woods National
Monument. When the Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937, the continuing
Depression and then World War II tempered growth. The postwar housing
boom touched Marin but also energized slow-growth sentiment. By the
mid-1960s, high demand for Marin real estate and low supply helped turn
the county into a province for the prosperous-and ripe for satire.</TE>
<TE>   The librarian points out a recent article in the Pacific Sun
concerning Bobos, or "Bourgeois Bohemians." Conservative pundit David
Brooks coined the term for his 2000 book "Bobos in Paradise," describing
the emerging social elite that reconciled the countercultural ideals of
the 1960s with the capitalistic strivers of the 1980s. In their hybrid
culture, the book jacket suggests, Bobos consider "spending $15,000 on a
media center vulgar, but spending $15,000 on a slate shower stall is a
sign you are at one with the Zen-like rhythms of nature."</TE>
<TE>   So maybe Marin is a time warp where the America of the '60s and the
America of the '80s smacked together in the '70s. Maybe Marin is the
petri dish where the first strain of Bobos was created, rising like steam
from a hot tub. But if that's the case, if Bobos are taking over,
whatever happened to the bona fide bohemians?</TE>
<TE>   Surveying a month's worth of Marin Independent Journals, your
correspondent's eyes settle on this headline: "Original Tubber calls Bush
'Misinformed.' "</TE>
<TE>   Up a snaking road from the town of Fairfax, then through a gate and
down a short path, is an 80-year-old shingled home where hot-tubbing
originals Al and Barbara Garvey have lived since 1966. Off to the side,
under the branches of a tall pine, is a dilapidated structure of rotting
redwood with a broken ladder leading to a decomposing 4-foot diameter tub
that has been dormant for a decade. There is no historic marker, but the
best intelligence suggests that this was the Eden of Marin hot tubbing.</TE>
<TE>   "Our record was 17 people-15 adults and our two daughters," Al says
proudly, blue eyes merry. It looked like "a sea anemone," he says, the
way people leaned back to make room. "And when we got out, there was no
water in the tub, no water at all."</TE>
<TE>   At 70, Al is a beatnik artist best known for carving distinctive
doorways. On this day he is wearing the overalls of a locomotive
engineer. Barbara, who is 67, carries herself with the practiced grace of
a dancer. About the time they retired the hot tub, the Garveys took up
the tango, which is why the hardwood floor of the living room is empty of
furniture.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower was president when the Garveys met while playing folk
guitar in Chicago. They arrived in Marin the day John F. Kennedy was
elected to the Oval Office. At first they rented a cheap cottage in
Sausalito and then lived on a houseboat that Al devised by moving an old
Navy building (purchased as scrap for $10) onto a barge. They later sold
it and lived in Majorca, Spain, for a few years before returning to
Marin.</TE>
<TE>   The Garveys initially thought of their hot tub as a Japanese bath,
like the one they had enjoyed with friends in Marin's Stinson Beach.
Those friends, however, invited only married couples into their tubs.
That wasn't the Garveys' style. Bring your friends, they would say. Over
the years, hundreds went into their barrel. Leaving one's underwear on
was a breach of etiquette. "We didn't have many square friends," Barbara
says. "And I have to say, there were people of all sizes and shapes, and
everybody without exception was beautiful without their clothes on." Soon
friends commissioned Al to create tub "environments" for them. Woodworker
Ed Stiles came to the Garveys' parties and built a few spas as well. It
became a kind of native Marin art form, and so were the parties.</TE>
<TE>   The Garveys can't speak for others, but they say their parties were,
all in all, rather innocent. "Oh, there was a certain amount of grass
smoked," Barbara allows. "But there was no free love or orgies going on.
Not here, not ever."</TE>
<TE>   Some might suggest that the Garveys were co-conspirators in the
creation of modern Marin, and thus the corruption of wholesome American
values that led a young man so astray that he wound up as a traitor
fighting for the Taliban. But how can that be, Al responds, when Marin
celebrates the personal freedoms that the Taliban would suppress? If John
Walker Lindh was rebelling against Marin values, is that really Marin's
fault? Isn't that like blaming America for Sept. 11? Still, the Garveys
agree that Marin is a funny place. "There are a lot of people with weird
ideas," Barbara says. "A friend of mine says, 'Marin is where the young
matron drives her Mercedes to the iridologist to find out if she has
breast cancer.' " Barbara suspects a licensed physician would be more
appropriate than someone who makes diagnoses by looking at an eye's iris.
"There are a lot of people with more money and more time on their hands
than they know what to do with."</TE>
<TE>   The Garveys, however, aren't among them. Their daughters long ago grew
to be yuppies with children of their own, and now Al is ready to retire.
The problem is, the Garveys say they can't get by in Marin on Social
Security alone. They bought their funky 3,000-square-foot home for
$30,000, and who knows what it would fetch now-$800,000? Whatever the
price, the Garveys aren't selling. They figure the rental income will
allow them to drive around Mexico in their camper and maybe settle in
Puerto Vallarta.</TE>
<TE>   "We like beautiful places," Barbara says. Wherever they go, they'll
tango.</TE>

<DH>Mario Miragliotta was a Rising Young Conductor, Until a Car
Accident Left Him Incapable of Directing Music the Traditional Way. He
Could Not Stand Up. He Could Not Use His Hands. He Wouldn't Give Up.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On the afternoon of June 14, 2001, Mario Miragliotta was driving
near Green River, Utah, on his way to Aspen, Colo., where he was to
participate in the American Academy of Conducting. Afterward, the
31-year-old with the twinkling eyes and wry smile was to go to Texas to
lead the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra. But on this day, he was too tired
to be behind the wheel. He fell asleep. His 1993 Isuzu Rodeo rolled
several times, breaking his neck. At the University of Utah Hospital,
where he spent more than a month, doctors inserted a titanium frame to
hold his C5 and C6 level vertebrae together.</LD>
<LD>   He was paralyzed from the chest down. He could barely move his arms
and neck, and his hands were frozen in position. The native of Sao Paulo,
Brazil, had once stood before orchestras, his shoulders, head, arms,
hands, fingers, even his hips eliciting sounds of joy or sadness or
whimsy or beauty. Now he couldn't turn a page of music.</LD>
<TE>   Miragliotta was assistant conductor of the Los Angeles-based American
Youth Symphony and had been appointed music director of the Santa Barbara
Youth Symphony and assistant conductor of the Los Angeles Chamber
Orchestra. A rising talent, he had earned a master's in viola performance
from Yale and another master's, in conducting, from USC in 1999. His
style on the podium had been highly animated. He was in continuous
motion, setting tempo, bringing in the violins, muting the tympany. Few
who have picked up the baton have not wished for a third hand or a second
set of eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Miragliotta could not stand up. He had limited movement in his arms.
Yet he did not hesitate. He believed he could learn a new visual
language, if musicians would be patient. Maybe he could rehabilitate his
upper body. He also knew that other conductors had overcome handicaps,
including James DePriest, music director and conductor of the Oregon
Symphony. DePriest, a polio victim, moves now with crutches and braces
and conducts while seated.</TE>
<TE>   Miragliotta's first opportunity to lead an orchestra came with the
American Youth Symphony. By then he had recovered much use of his arms.
He had himself strapped into his wheelchair for rehearsals. "Because I
cannot use my hands to turn pages, I have to memorize everything. I'm
using my arms to conduct since my hands are not really functional. I
could muscle the orchestra before my accident. I could grab someone by
their collar and pull them through the whole concert. And many conductors
do that . . . I cannot do that anymore."</TE>
<TE>   He found that the best way to correct mistakes was to stop the music
and give instructions orally. It was cumbersome, but the musicians were
receptive. "Once you raise your arms regardless of whether the rest of
your body or your hands are working, the musicians feel your energy," he
says. "It's almost like telepathy."</TE>
<TE>   How did the orchestra adjust? "We're so used to him being so alive,
walking around, being really in our face about what he wanted to do,"
says Deborah Klak, principal second violinist with the American Youth
Symphony. "You see this broken body, but within him there is so much
life. You can tell when there's an exciting part . . . the whole podium
and the wheelchair shake." The orchestra learned to read Miragliotta's
"expressions and his eyes as opposed to the body," she says, a form of
communication that musicologist Karl Haas described in his book "Inside
Music" as perhaps more important than elegant hand movements. As Klak
explains, "There's a lot in a conductor's face when they want some
passage to be really sad or funny or intense."</TE>
<TE>   That works better for the strings, which are seated closest to the
conductor, than for musicians seated farther away, such as Kazem
Abdullah, who was principal clarinet at the time. But even from that
distance, Abdullah says, the musicians eventually learned Miragliotta's
new language. "He still has a strong essence of pulse . . . you can still
feel the rhythm from him, so therefore it's not difficult to follow from
as far back as my section. You can tell when somebody has the pulse of
the music inside of them . . . and from there finds some way through
their body to show it."</TE>
<TE>   Eight months and two operations after the accident, Miragliotta led
the youth symphony in concert at UCLA's Royce Hall. It was a first giant
step. Mark Artusio, the symphony's orchestra manager, says the question
now is not "how much Mario will recover or what he'll be able to do when
he recovers. Mario has recovered. If he wants to be a conductor, he's
going to learn how to be a conductor this way. He's got the ears, which
is the most important thing in conducting . . . he's got the musical
talent."</TE>
<TE>   But Miragliotta has conducted just that one concert. He moved to San
Diego for regular exercise sessions with Ted Dardzinski, founder of
Project Walk, which has helped some people walk again through the
unconventional method of removing them from their wheelchairs to exercise
their paralyzed limbs. The American Youth Symphony invited Miragliotta to
return, but his stepped-up exercise regimen, which consumes three to four
hours daily, could make that difficult. He also had an offer from
Classics for Kids, a San Diego-area organization that plays for children.</TE>
<TE>   For now, he continues to struggle with unstable blood pressure,
fatigue, spasms and breathing difficulties, but he is sleeping better.
His upper body strength has improved, although he cannot brush his teeth
without his wife or mother first attaching a brace with a toothbrush to
his right arm. He cannot pick up his son Sergio. There are things he
cannot do now and may never do.</TE>
<TE>   One thing he holds on to is the ability to tap into the intangible-the
pulse-and convey his musical ideas to his players. No one knows if it
will be enough to sustain his career. For now he feels fortunate to be
making progress. "Most quadraplegics can't go back to the work they were
doing." he says. "How many careers can you do where you have to remain in
a chair and you can't use your hands? God, it's tough, but in a way I'm
very lucky."</TE>

<DH>A couple build their dream house on a challenging Silver Lake Lot</DH>

<LD>DOCUMENTARY PRODUCER LAUREN LEXTON AND HER HUSBAND, KEVIN
MACCARTHY, A TELEVISION SHOW director, were living in a charming
600-square-foot bungalow near Elysian Park but they desperately needed
more space. Rising home costs in neighboring Silver Lake were not only
frustrating but prohibitive, so the couple considered a friend's
suggestion to build their own home. At first they were skeptical, but
when Lexton happened upon an intriguing property in a real estate
brochure, they decided to take a closer look. "By the time we climbed to
the top of the hillside lot and turned to see the city at our feet, we
were pretty well hooked," Lexton says. It was in the Moreno Highlands
section of Silver Lake-a neighborhood named after Antonio Moreno, the
Latin lover of the silent movie era who invested in the area. "The lot
was a good price," MacCarthy says, "but we should have asked ourselves
why no one had built on it before." After initial research showed the
hillside had a sandstone foundation, the couple breathed a sigh of
relief. It was short-lived. "We discovered that whether you're on solid
rock or landfill, you still have to sink caissons into underlying bedrock
and build a retaining wall to hold up the hillside." A 58-by-14-foot
concrete wall now stands behind the home, which is supported by a dozen
caissons sunk 26 feet into bedrock. 'More than a third of our costs were
spent just getting out of the ground," MacCarthy says. To design the
house on this complicated site, the couple called in Culver City
architect Lorcan O'Herlihy, known for his "architecture of removal" and
refined, crafted houses. "I have a reductive approach to architecture,"
O'Herlihy says. "I like to pare down to very simple forms and focus on
materiality and light."</LD>
<TE>   He designed a two-story home with a horizontal first floor that
encompasses an open-plan living room, kitchen, dining room and office,
with a small guest room and second office tucked behind the kitchen. The
vertical second story comprises the master bedroom suite. "We raised the
house toward the top of the hill, which allowed for privacy as well as
optimizing the views," O'Herlihy explains. "It's a longer walk up to the
front door, but the return is tenfold." For visual interest and to keep
costs down, the architect wrapped the 2,000-square-foot house with
inexpensive pine slats "to conceptually link the house to the site where
pine trees grow." O'Herlihy sprayed waterproofing on the plywood walls,
then applied a skin of slats set an inch and a half out from the walls to
allow air to circulate and the house to breathe. Each of the panels was
fabricated on the ground, then tilted up and screwed into the building.
"If one of the pine slats needs to be replaced in the future, it can be
repaired per panel as needed." For the home's interior, the architect
used inexpensive materials in creative ways. Varnished kitchen cabinets
made of MDF-a composite material that is normally painted-keep company
with simple concrete counter tops. A polyester fabric with a metallic
backing in a shimmering grayish-blue steel acts as a soft wall that
separates MacCarthy's home office from the open living area. A simple
acrylic-and-wood panel screen on a track allows for flexiblity of space
between the guest bedroom and Lexton's office.</TE>
<TE>   "When no one is in the guest room the panel slides open up to make my
office seem larger," she says. Bamboo floors run throughout the house,
offering warmth and an interesting alternative to traditional hardwood
floors. As for color, "it's a wood house so it's basically brown and
white," MacCarthy says. Working with interior designer Charlene Mortale,
the couple selected small jolts of color to enliven the space. An orange
wall the color of an Herms box is the backdrop for their bed, while a
blue storage area adjacent to MacCarthy's office was inspired by the cool
blue of his neighbor's '63 Thunderbird, which is frequently parked in
front of the house. The couple are happy they built their own home, but
MacCarthy admits: "It requires a bit of lunacy to start a house from
scratch. But I wouldn't love any house as much as the one we've built for
ourselves. It all worked out, thank God, and that's a very satisfying
feeling."</TE>

<DH>The Secret to the Perennially Refreshing Mai Tai at Damon's</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOU MATHEWS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1970, when I left Los Angeles, I had no reason to look back. I
was headed north to UC Santa Cruz, which was-at that moment-the hottest,
hippest campus in the country. The day before I left, I realized there
was one thing I would miss: Damon's Steak House on Central Avenue in
Glendale. Damon's had been there since 1937, a date that was
disconcerting because the restaurant felt like a late-1940s bar. It
looked like two GIs had returned from the Pacific campaign in World War
II and opened the bar they remembered from Fiji. There were palm fronds,
fish nets, glass floats, coconut halves, tiki gods, fake orchids and an
emphasis on rum drinks. There were decent steaks, stuffed baked potatoes
and grandmotherly waitresses who called you "Hon" and pretended to take
your order. However you ordered your steak, it arrived medium rare. The
servers recommended the mai tais instead of red wine, and they were
right. These cocktails were sweet, but after the initial sugar shock,
they had a sensual and addictive quality. Damon's mai tai was my first
legal drink, and I knew I couldn't leave L.A. without the recipe.</LD>
<TE>   So the morning before my departure for Santa Cruz, I felt completely
decadent walking from the sunlit parking lot into Damon's narrow, dark
bar. I was the only customer, but the bartender smiled and pretended it
was completely normal to order a serious rum drink before noon. He slid
the mai tai, garnished with a pineapple chunk on a toothpick spear, to a
stop before me. I sipped and explained why I was there. I tipped the
then-princely sum of five bucks and walked out with the recipe recorded
on a napkin. I was ready to leave L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Northern California was colder, and as I grew older, rum and sugar
made less sense. I switched to dark beers and bourbon and stayed with
them even after I moved back to Los Angeles in '81. I might have stayed
with those drinks forever if I hadn't been reintroduced to the pleasures
of rum almost two decades later. In 1987 I was dropped into Nicaragua for
several months to cover the making of the Universal/Alex Cox movie
"Walker," a wonderful disaster on many levels. The local rum, Flor de
Cana, benefited from a lack of technology. If you simply crushed sugar
cane and distilled it without the industrial capitalist overlay of
pasteurization, preservatives or additives, the product was much more
intense. It was like a single malt Scotch for the masses. You could be
deep in the jungle and hear the whirr of a battery-run blender
deconstructing Flor de Cana with some tropical fruit no one could name,
and the result was beguiling.</TE>
<TE>   Back in L.A., faced with the prospect of the annual block party in my
Beachwood Canyon neighborhood, I remembered Damon's mai tais. They've
been a staple of our summer parties for 14 years now, and they've had
something to do, I think, with an increasingly amicable neighborhood
vibe.</TE>
<TE>   That first year I remember trying to persuade my neighbor James to try
one. James is a tall, dignified fellow in his 70s, and he told me that
no, he really didn't like sweet drinks. I handed him one and left to tend
the barbecue. Hours later I ran into James sipping his third mai tai.
"These are very refreshing," he said solemnly.</TE>
<TE>Damon's Mai Tai (circa 1969)</TE>

<DH>With Its Sophisticated Cooking, R-23 Deserves a Wider Following</DH>

<LD>Seated at the Japanese restaurant R-23, waiting for the last of our
party of four to arrive, I feel the tensions of the day begin to unravel
in this serene space. Just as I order a few appetizers for the table, my
friend ambles in. As he sits down, his sleepy eyes take in the sushi bar
at the back of the old warehouse, and then the big Gauguin-inspired
paintings on the exposed brick walls. "I've been here before," he says.
"Years ago, when I first moved to L.A. and had absolutely no clue as to
where anything was in relation to anything else. I always meant to come
back."</LD>
<LD>   I suspect that happens to most people. The restaurant's location east
of Little Tokyo is definitely below the radar, except to sushi
aficionados or people who live or work downtown. Even those who have been
here have a hard time remembering its location. Just head east on 2nd
Street, past the brightly lit sushi bars and noodle joints, and jog to
the left across Alameda. When you see the MegaToys warehouse looming on
the left, you're almost there. Look for a small sidewalk signboard, and
beside it, at least at night, a van with its rear window spelling out
R-23 in big letters and an arrow pointing right.</LD>
<TE>   The dozen or so parking spots in front of the warehouse loading dock
are filled with spiffy SUVs, a couple of Jags and a BMW motorcycle, along
with a handful of unremarkable rides. A brick wall runs alongside,
decorated with a hard-edged arabesque of graffiti that's so arresting you
begin to wonder whether it's a Geffen Contemporary art installation.</TE>
<TE>   As the waiter serves us a plate of crinkly grilled Japanese peppers
and a bowl of edamame, one of my friends notes the Frank Gehry chairs of
his first visit. They've held up rather well, considering they're made of
corrugated cardboard, and they're surprisingly comfortable, just like the
restaurant. The low light, the murmur of conversation, and the music-an
old tango, a Portuguese fado, a riff of something sweet or
melancholy-soothes and reassures. For this reason, R-23 gets a mixed
crowd, everyone from artists and architects from the neighborhood to
Japanese visitors; there's even a young hipster's birthday party.</TE>
<TE>   But sushi is not what brings me to R-23. It's good, but not
remarkable. The cooked food is what sets the 11-year-old restaurant
apart. Those dishes are made with flair. Some are on the menu, but most
are on the page of specials.</TE>
<TE>   This night there's a Dungeness crab salad, of sweet and fresh lump
crab meat, mizuna greens, crunchy little Japanese cucumbers, a few bites
of endive and radicchio, and something with a crisp, juicy crunch
reminiscent of Fuji apple, only starchier. It turns out to be Japanese
mountain yam. Topping the salad is a lively yuzu-infused dressing.  The
tempura is terrific. Sweet shrimp tempura comes cloaked in a shaggy
jacket of batter laced with shards of "soybean paper" that fry up light
and crisp. Lobster tempura is a spectacular platter of the claws and
tail, complete with a flap of gorgeous fresh shiitake mushroom, a fan of
Japanese eggplant and a few delectable onion rings, all in a gossamer
batter. The lobster tastes as if it just came from the sea.</TE>
<TE>   Kumamoto oysters on the half shell, however, aren't compelling and, at
$2.50 each, as expensive as I've ever seen.</TE>
<TE>   Shimeji mushrooms are cut as thick as steak fries and sauteed with
Japanese hot pepper flakes. They come stacked on the plate like logs. I
love the Japanese mussels steamed in sake with squares of tofu and smoky
shiitake mushrooms that are scored on top like the gills of a fish. The
taste of the sake with the slightly thickened mussel juice is fabulous.
Sometimes they'll have silver dollar-sized sawagani crabs from Japan.
Fried to a satisfying crunch, just pop them in your mouth whole. There's
also a lively dish of shrimp in a spicy tomato sauce with a real kick.</TE>
<TE>   But my favorite dish may be the grilled yellowtail collar. The flesh
is rich and pleasantly oily, as satisfying as a prime steak, especially
the closer you get to the bone. The grilled duck breast stuffed with
Japanese scallions is something special, too, cut in thick slices and
served medium rare in its barely sweetened juices. I love the taste of
the sweet, mild Japanese scallions with the tender duck breast. This is a
dish for a great red wine.</TE>
<TE>   Dessert? Not much is offered, just ice cream wrapped in mochi or a
couple of other flavors. They're out of both vanilla and coffee mochi, so
we compromise with Haagen-Dazs cappuccino ice cream, a flavor the waiter
tells us is available only in restaurants. It doesn't taste much like
cappuccino, but the flavors of coffee, cream and chocolate are spun into
a delicious balance.</TE>
<TE>   As we eat, R-23's music moves to the Beatles, and soon we're nodding
to the beat and talking about Sir Paul's recent marriage and how full of
innocence and joy the early albums were. I can't remember the last time I
really listened to the music in a restaurant. As we come out, still
humming "And I Love Her," we're looking west, where a gap in a chain-link
fence frames the lights of downtown's towers, with a chunk of milky moon
swaying above. That alone is worth the visit.</TE>

<HD>'The Dark Hibernal Shore'</HD>
<DH>THE COLLECTED POEMS OF TENNESSEE WILLIAMS ; Edited by David
Roessel and Nicholas Moschovakis; New Directions: 304 pp., $29.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADAM KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>Adam Kirsch is the author of the forthcoming book of
poems "The Thousand Wells."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1939, Thomas Lanier Williams III published his first story under
the pseudonym that was to become famous. Why he picked the state of
Tennessee is not entirely clear--he was born in Mississippi in 1911,
and grew up in St. Louis, Mo.--but the name change corresponded to,
and memorialized, a change in the nature of his literary ambitions.
For the rest of his life, according to Donald Spoto's biography, "The
Kindness of Strangers," he told interviewers that he discarded
"Thomas Lanier" because it "sounds like it might belong to the sort
of writer who turns out sonnet sequences to spring." This was
literally the case; readers of the St. Louis Star Times on March 25,
1936, would have found the three insipid poems of Williams' "Sonnets
for the Spring (A Sequence)," winner of a $25 prize from the
Wednesday Club:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   I feel the onward rush of spring once more</LD>
<TE>   Breaking upon the unresistant land</TE>
<TE>   And foaming up the dark hibernal shore</TE>
<TE>   As turbulent waves unfurled on turbid sand!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Lanier Williams sounded like a tame antebellum poetaster;
Tennessee Williams would be a revolutionary dramatist.</TE>
<TE>   This division was real, but it was not quite total. Williams
continued to write poems until the end of his life, though his style
evolved from decorous Victorianism to a loose, anecdotal free verse,
and he published two books of poetry, "In the Winter of Cities"
(1956) and "Androgyne, Mon Amour" (1977). As late as 1944, he enjoyed
more success as a poet than as a playwright: "Battle of Angels" had
bombed in Boston, but James Laughlin, the legendary editor of New
Directions, included Williams in the prestigious anthology "Five
Young American Poets." Not until the tumultuous success of "The Glass
Menagerie," at the beginning of 1945, did Williams' stage work
decisively edge out his poetry.</TE>
<TE>   This new volume of Williams' "Collected Poems," then, complete
with extensive notes, is a perfectly valid addition to his canon.
Still, there is something shy-making about Williams' poetry, which
even this book can't entirely ignore. The disparity in achievement
between "A Streetcar Named Desire," on the one hand, and "Androgyne,
Mon Amour" on the other, is so enormous as to be embarrassing. In a
1995 interview, Laughlin tried to put the best possible spin on
Williams' poetry: "the New Critics came along, and everything had to
be all these formalist structures--and Tennessee would just write
down what came into his heart." In their introduction, editors David
Roessel and Nicholas Moschovakis take a similar tack, chivalrously
defending Williams against the " 'snippy' verdicts of an increasingly
insular and academic poetry scene."</TE>
<TE>   Neither envy nor prejudice, however, is needed to account for a
negative judgment on Williams' poetry. At its worst, it is very bad.
Sometimes it is silly doggerel:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Androgyne, mon amour,</TE>
<TE>   Brochette de coeur was plat du jour,</TE>
<TE>   (heart lifted on a metal skewer,</TE>
<TE>   encore saignante et palpitante)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At other moments it is adolescent and precious:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lament for the velvety moths, for the moths were lovely.</TE>
<TE>   Often their tender thoughts, for they thought of me,</TE>
<TE>   Eased the neurotic ills that haunt the day.</TE>
<TE>   Now an invisible evil takes them away.</TE>
<TE>   And much of the time it is formlessly portentous:</TE>
<TE>   All roses, the immense impartiality of all God and all roses,</TE>
<TE>   Announcing, Yes, now as before, yes, now is the moment,</TE>
<TE>   A power that draws the light back into its source....</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To set against these depths, Williams offers only a few moderate
heights. Devotees of the plays can turn to the poems for interesting
parallels and biographical insights; "The Beanstalk Country," for
instance, expands on a phrase that Williams would use in "Sweet Bird
of Youth," and "Cortege" vividly evokes his miserable childhood. But
none of these poems would be read today if it were by an unknown
writer.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' best poems have the same subjects as his worst--usually
adolescent misery and sexual promiscuity--but treat them with a
becoming irony, a shade of black humor. In "Life Story," he sounds
like Frank O'Hara:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After you've been to bed together for the first time,</TE>
<TE>   without the advantage or disadvantage of any prior acquaintance,</TE>
<TE>   the other party very often says to you,</TE>
<TE>   Tell me about yourself, I want to know all about you...</TE>
<TE>   You tell them your story, or as much of your story</TE>
<TE>   as time or a fair degree of prudence allows, and they say,</TE>
<TE>   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,</TE>
<TE>   each time a little more faintly, until the oh</TE>
<TE>   is just an audible breath....</TE>
<TE>   Well, one of you falls asleep</TE>
<TE>   and the other one does likewise with a lighted cigarette in his
mouth,</TE>
<TE>   and that's how people burn to death in hotel rooms.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And in "Intimations" he starts out, at least, with an
interestingly self-mocking tone--"I have received no serious wound as
yet/but I am expecting several"--before working his way up to
full-throated hysteria:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I reach for the white scratch-pad:</TE>
<TE>   They'll come again!</TE>
<TE>   They'll come again and I'll be unprepared!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hysteria, or at least an unbridled indulgence of vague emotion, is
the keynote of Williams' poetry. This is what Laughlin tried to
euphemize as writing down "what came into his heart," which is as
close as one could get to a prescription for bad poetry. Nothing is
more heartfelt than a wail of pain, but a wail of pain is not a poem,
as Williams demonstrates in "The Couple":</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You speak your name: repeat it in slow marvel:</TE>
<TE>   the shock of your identity hits you so--</TE>
<TE>   It clubs you! Knocks you senseless nearly!</TE>
<TE>   I am I!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Williams only alludes here to a common emotion; he does not
succeed at re-creating it. The "I am I," the subjectivity of another
mind, is the most elusive prey of literature, and elaborate nets are
needed for its capture.</TE>
<TE>   Where Williams does snare that prey, of course, is in his stage
works. The subjectivity of Blanche Dubois or Laura Wingfield is
powerful and unforgettable; these fictional creations are
paradoxically more real than the real Tennessee Williams we meet in
the poems. And this is because they are what T.S. Eliot, in a
discussion of Shakespeare's plays, called "objective correlatives":
concrete, external representations of an inner emotion, which demands
such a rigorous and circuitous path to expression. The value of
Williams' poems is to show the vast distance between writing down
what comes into your heart and literary art.</TE>

<DH>SOLIAH: The Sara Jane Olson Story; By Sharon Darby Hendry;
Cable Publishing: 372 pp., $18.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG GOLDIN</AU>
<BD>Greg Goldin is a writer who contributes to numerous
publications, including LA Weekly and Los Angeles magazine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Sara Jane Olson pleaded guilty last October for her role in the
1975 attempted pipe bombings of two LAPD patrol cars, the coda on the
Symbionese Liberation Army finally seemed to have been written. The
gang that had assassinated Marcus Foster, the first black
superintendent of Oakland's public schools, and kidnapped Patricia
Hearst was at last confirmed as homemade, middle-class American
terrorists. But when Olson promptly renounced her plea, then
reaffirmed her plea, then tried to formally withdraw her plea, the
refugee from the 1970s was seen to embody, in her exasperating
seesawing, the very tensions that arise whenever anyone asks, "Who
were the radicals of the 1960s?" Was the early 1970s spasm of
recklessness and violence the inevitable outcome of New Left
politics? Are the SLA members of what David Horowitz calls the
Destructive Generation, who refuse to accept responsibility for their
violent misdeeds, or are they miscreants whose deadly debauchery has
no genuine connection to the loftier hopes and aspirations of the
1960s? Either way, the authoritarian impulses of the SLA--like those
of the Weather Underground and the Black Panther Party--shadow any
interpretation of the 1960s.</LD>
<TE>   Kathleen Soliah (she later changed her name to Sara Jane Olson)
herself might have remained cosseted in obscurity, comfortably
removed from this debate, had she, like other SLA members, been put
on trial back in the 1970s. But Soliah, who had helped harbor the
fugitive gang, disappeared on the fall day in 1975 when the FBI
captured Bill and Emily Harris, along with their infamous victim,
Patricia Hearst. The Harrises were convicted of kidnapping and served
eight years. Hearst was given seven years for her role in the
Hibernia Bank robbery, the term commuted by President Jimmy Carter,
the crime pardoned by President Bill Clinton. Had Soliah not fled and
had she not reinvented herself as Olson, a suburban St. Paul, Minn.,
housewife, she might have stood trial two decades ago for her
involvement with the SLA and moved on. Yet she ran, only to step back
into the public spotlight amid recent '60s revisionism, and Sara Jane
Olson--at best a difficult, inscrutable figure--quickly became a
convenient pivot upon which the dispute might turn again and again.
Her guilt or innocence suggested a verdict on an entire generation.
Her conviction only hardened the combatants.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Darby Hendry dispenses with much of this historical fuss in
"Soliah." Instead she casts her subject as a true-crime story, with
the central mystery--what motivated Olson to join such a violent
group and how was she able to live all those years cut off from her
past, her family and, ultimately, herself--left for others to parse.
Hendry takes the pulse of the SLA thus: "Many of them had acted in
college and they still needed the applause, approval, and to create
their own stage, their own environment. They wanted the power to be
who they wanted to be in ultimate freedom--to create their roles,
their rules, their lives, their own drama, their own press reports.
They thrived on this power."</TE>
<TE>   Hendry makes it sound as if the SLA was a rock 'n' roll band, a
familiar and lazy analogy that dodges the deeper truth about these
politicos-turned-hooligans. Theirs was a stunted idealism born after
its moment--the popular revolt of the 1960s--was gone. Behind the
gibberish of "Death to the Fascist Insect That Preys Upon the Life of
the People" was a program that was part Bolshevik, part PTA.
Capitalism was out, but so was mistreatment of the elderly and
children. The trouble was, no one was listening. It was as if, in the
SLA, the antiwar slogan "What if they gave a war and nobody came?"
had come to life. They believed in the "growing spirit of the people"
when Richard Nixon was fashioning reelection out of working-class
neighborhoods, north and south.</TE>
<TE>   Vexed, politically checkmated, they grasped one thing perhaps more
perfectly than any of their more potent political progenitors. The
SLA nabbed Patty Hearst at the dawn of the telegenic age, and the
group was wildly successful at latching onto this new mainspring of
society. The SLA managed to project its image so widely that the tiny
sect actually believed it could change the world.</TE>
<TE>   In the crucible of this self-righteous delusion, all faith in the
democratic process was smashed as naive and retrograde, and all
political opponents became depersonalized objects of hate, worthy
even of the death sentence. As Emily Harris is alleged to have said
of Myrna Opsahl, a bystander killed by the SLA during its 1975
robbery of the Crocker National Bank in Carmichael, near Sacramento,
"She was a bourgeois pig anyway." This horrid, threadbare political
excuse was transparent when it was uttered, but Soliah stood by her
comrades.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hendry sidesteps this bitter side of the '60s, the
factual outline of the transformation of Kathleen Soliah, the
Palmdale high school pep chairman, into the fugitive Sara Jane Olson
is competently mooted. We learn that like most bright idealistic
California youngsters circa 1968, Soliah was moved by the
assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy; that
she, like others, opposed the war in Vietnam; that she and her
boyfriend, Jim Kilgore (the last member of the SLA still at large)
went to Berkeley in 1971, vaguely in search of the "alternative"
lifestyle that existed there. From March 1972 on, Hendry reports,
Soliah was increasingly associated with the fringe radicalism that
eventually would curdle into the SLA.</TE>
<TE>   As the story unfolds, "chemical explosives, gunpowder, fuses,
blasting caps ... and a small arsenal of rifles and pistols" come
into play. Later, Soliah eulogizes her close friend, Angela Atwood,
who was incinerated May 17, 1974, in the live, globally televised
LAPD-SLA shootout on East 54th Street in South-Central. Then it's
stolen getaway cars, disguises, bank robbery and murder. The facts
begin to have an appalling weight all their own, as Soliah is drawn,
along with her brother, Steve, and sister, Josephine, into the SLA's
second round of "politics of the deed"--terrorist acts that, by
themselves, were intended to spark a revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Hendry's account of Soliah's involvement in the Opsahl slaying, as
well as her procuring of bomb-making materials, follows closely Patty
Hearst's memoir "Every Secret Thing" and Vin McLellan and Paul
Avery's superb "Voices of Guns." For those who have plowed their way
through the rest of the SLA literature, the narrative will be
familiar. However, Hendry does bring us up to date on the
circumstantial evidence--palm prints, handwriting, traceable
banknotes, ballistics--that may convict Olson, along with the
Harrises and Michael Bortin, at their upcoming trial in Sacramento
for the Opsahl slaying.</TE>
<TE>   On the matter of confusing criminality for politics, Hendry has it
right. She quotes a Minneapolis Star Tribune editorial written soon
after Olson's indictment on the Opsahl slaying. The "demands of
justice should be fulfilled just as readily for a doctor's wife from
St. Paul as for a jobless wanderer from Detroit. Surely the activist
in Sara Jane Olson would agree." With this epitaph for the SLA,
Hendry closes a crime-bio steady on the facts if a little short on
the insights.</TE>

<HD>Reveries of a Solitary Walker</HD>
<DH>Donald Richie teaches us the modern art of learning how to
be a foreigner</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PICO IYER</AU>
<BD>Pico Iyer is the author of numerous books, including
"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto" and the forthcoming
novel "Abandon." His essay is adapted from the foreword to a new
edition of "The Inland Sea," to be published by Stone Bridge Press in
September.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The foreigner in Japan, more than anywhere, stands at the edge of an
intimacy that is closing slowly in his face. He walks along a beach,
perhaps, as darkness falls, with a young alluring girl, and they talk
of loneliness and all the places he has seen, the nights. The girl
offers to introduce him to a local inn, where he will be taken care
of, and they walk together up to a private room and sit by the
window, looking out at the sea. Then he touches her arm, and the
spell is broken. Giggling, she makes her diplomatic retreat. The next
morning, when he rises to leave the small town by boat, sailing away
into the mist, he sees her there, on the pier, with two friends,
waiting for him with presents and goodbyes.</LD>
<LD>   It is a haunting moment from Donald Richie's "The Inland Sea," and
one that stands for a lifetime of such moments for those of us who
find ourselves on the island of half-opened doors. It is made more
touching by the fact that the girl knows she will never see the
places that she dreams of; all her days will be spent in this
forgotten town. And it is made more plangent by the fact that the
foreigner confesses to himself (and to us) that the encounter is
perplexing to him because he is "innocent despite experience" and
innocent not only because he sees no point in guilt.</LD>
<TE>   The plumbing of innocence and loneliness, the incarnation of a
deeply Japanese freedom from cynicism and openness to wonder, the
attentiveness to all the fine print, emotional and otherwise, in
every fleeting moment are part of what make Richie the most lasting
and graceful foreign writer on Japan since Lafcadio Hearn (and
before). He apprehends Japan, in all senses, on its own terms yet
puts it in a larger picture. He catches the sound of the sea through
the mist, the fisherman's no-nonsense explanation of how the ocean
will bring him a living, and then the sense of loss that is what the
sound, and the explanation, mean. Richie writes that Japan keeps its
visitors permanently enchanted--and vexed--through its teasing mix of
intimacy and distance; it is that same mix, brought to us through a
companionable yet solitary traveler, utterly unguarded but always
discreet, that gives his own prose its particular strength and
beauty. The writing is open, unpretentious, immediate, yet entirely
poised, unhurried, at peace with mystery.</TE>
<TE>   For such a large presence, which attracts so many votaries and
critics from abroad, Japan has been strangely ill-served by its
foreign writers. There is never any shortage of books purporting to
lay its secrets bare through a microscopic scrutiny of its business
practices, its political structures or its neon lanes, yet all of
them, in the end, say the same thing (about how well Japan manages to
keep its public face intact). And faced with the girl on the beach,
many foreigners are apt to dilate on sexual mores in Japan, others to
start anthropologizing about the persistence of rural custom, still
others to talk about the rigid status quo that keeps the girl on the
island. Richie is the only one I know who will follow the experience
through to where explanations fall away, confide his own clumsiness
to us and not even begin to attempt larger formulations or grand
summations. It is, he knows, just an encounter, all but inexplicable,
between one stranger and another.</TE>
<TE>   Richie first found himself in Japan during the occupation, as a
merchant seaman in Okinawa in 1946. In the half-century since, he has
written dozens of books on the adopted home he's never really left:
books on its Zen ways and its sex clubs, books on its films, tattoos
and gardens. Yet the truest distillation of the place that has eluded
so many of the rest of us comes in his classic book of travels, "The
Inland Sea," about to be reissued. Sidestepping special interests and
provincialisms, determined to be neither a narrow scholar nor a
wide-eyed newcomer, Richie simply wandered around the largely
unvisited and undeveloped parts of Japan that ran along the inland
sea in the late '60s and described what they looked and sounded like.</TE>
<TE>   Though the book first came out in 1971, it seems more urgent than
ever today, in part because it records a world of rural custom that
is fast becoming extinct and in part because it catches something
deeper in Japan that never really changes. A typical Richie moment
finds him walking up a hill to a shrine, perhaps, and telling us some
of the folklore and history that surround the place; he pauses to
observe how people talk (or don't talk) in this ostensibly holy site
and then comes out again, with some gentle rumination on the
country's relation to silence and worship and time. Driven by no
designs upon the culture, he mostly describes it through its people:
the kids and old women, bar girls and gangsters who open their hearts
to him and tell him their stories. As often as not, their stories
have no ending, or leave him with a question he knows he cannot
answer.</TE>
<TE>   An ease with incompleteness, then, is part of what lights up his
meditations, as is a refusal of all pomp and cant. At one point in
"The Inland Sea," he begins to talk about what the Japanese love of
Turkish baths says about their sense of men and women; then he stops
because, he realizes, the Japanese would make nothing of it at all.
At another moment, he briefly congratulates himself on being able to
identify a pavane by Gabriel Faure, only for the woman at his side to
hum along with the melody and tell him where he's wrong. He has left
Tokyo, one senses, because the big city is less and less itself
(and--what is much the same thing--is taking itself more and more
seriously, as a modern Western capital), and he seeks out the
forgotten places of the interior partly because they still have an
unself-conscious candor. And yet where other foreigners in Japan
regularly write books on "looking for the lost" or mourning the
beauties that are dying, only Richie manages, first, to find the
lost, and then to acknowledge that loss, as much as anything, lies
partly in the eye of the beholder. He can afford to be a self-styled
"romantic" only because--like the country around him--he is so
pragmatic.</TE>
<TE>   The reader fortunate enough to join him on his journeys will
quickly see that unself-consciousness and candor are what distinguish
the traveler, too. And he will probably find himself carried away by
the watercolor beauty of the prose, touched by what Junichiro
Tanizaki, praising shadows, called a "pensive luster" (it's no
surprise to learn that Richie is an accomplished painter, as well as
musician, actor and filmmaker). "All in sea or sky is tint rather
than color," as Hearn wrote, describing the "sober and delicate
beauty" of Japan, an "all-temperate world where nothing is garish."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, I would venture to say that there is not a graceless
sentence in his prose. Richie has no time for artifice, but, we
quickly see, he is a serious admirer of craft. "The Inland Sea" flows
with an easy natural charm, and yet, at its end, as if by chance we
get a long-awaited letter, a searching reflection on the author and
his relation to the place where he's chosen to live and a silvered
epiphany on the sea.</TE>
<TE>   The other thing that hits one, reading Richie, is that he is a
great writer on Japan partly because he is interested in everything
outside Japan; the least dogmatic of foreign observers, he is also
the least narrow in his focus. Often, he is able to explain the place
because he can set it next to Munich, or Calcutta, or Lima, Ohio; and
its very particular way of being and aesthetic he makes familiar to
us, and close, by referring to Flemish war paintings or to Seneca. It
is this background of learning and refinement, I think--this interest
in painting and music and books--that helps Richie be merely amused
by what rouses anger in many others and to see what others call
"hypocrisy" as a deeply sincere upholding of a public role.</TE>
<TE>   And yet for all the worldliness, he is still able, after 20 years
in Japan, to be moved, largely because he draws no artificial
borders. Horace Walpole and William Beckford are invoked in the same
passage that begins with a discussion of "Barbarella"; Mickey and
Minnie, that talismanic pair so easy to mock, he sees as invested
with what future generations will regard as "that implacable air of
mystery which we now find in pre-Columbian sculpture or the artifacts
of Etruria." In his reveries of a solitary walker (he would not mind,
I think, the title from Rousseau), he can make Confucius
apprehensible through Calvin, and so begin to tell us how Japan has
"found means to call a truce, if not halt, to the great war between
aspirations and actuality" and how, not unrelatedly, in Japan "you
can change your mood as you can change your mind."</TE>
<TE>   It is, in fact, an injustice to call Richie a writer on Japan;
really, he is a writer on artifice and time and death, on being
human. And most of all he's a writer on the peculiarly modern art of
learning how to be a foreigner. As universal travel has propelled
more and more of us to lives very far from the places where we were
born (and brought the Other to every neighborhood), the writers of
the past few decades have often been chroniclers of Abroad. Paul
Bowles takes us into the skins of those half-innocents abroad who so
seek out a foreign mystery that at last they are consumed by it;
Graham Greene gives an almost theological quality to the lonely
orphan far from home, reaching out for a friend who turns out to be
corrupt, or doomed, or both; and Jan Morris has taken into the modern
world the image of a universally sensitive writer, traveling alone,
taking in everything with a sympathy made deeper by the fact it's so
discerning. Richie belongs in their company as much as any; and in
the company of Somerset Maugham, say, touring around the human
landscape with a tolerant acuity. And he has more to say than anyone
I know on the expatriate condition, the freedom of the man abroad,
and the poignancy that underwrites it. He needs to be read by people
with no interest in Japan and by those who never plan to visit that
far-off island.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The only problem with Richie's writing, in fact, is that it's
never been easy enough to find around the world, in part because
people, knowing him to be a writer in Japan, assume that he's a
writer on Japan. And as a pure reflective writer of a kind that seems
all but antique, he has done nothing to sell himself to the world or
to dress himself up with gestures or high concepts (indeed, part of
the beauty of his prose is that it has the unforced, unmistakable
sound of someone thinking, honestly and rigorously, to himself).
Stone Bridge Press began to rectify this absence with its publication
of the "Donald Richie Reader" last year, but the best place to get
him all in one place--and in one uninterrupted narrative--is "The
Inland Sea."</TE>
<TE>   I will not spoil the pleasure of meeting those pages for the first
time by writing at length about my own favorite moments (the sound of
the lepers' bells from the beautiful island where even the healthy
are imprisoned), and I will not belabor the point (as is made in a
new afterword) that the places he saw fading in 1971 are now 30 years
closer to extinction. I will not even bother to note that the
Japanese you meet in his writing, being individual and true, are not
at all like the people you have heard about: They get up late and
dislike perfection and are not, he tells us, uniquely clean. Many of
the people he encounters are virgins, in every sense, and he goes out
of his way, almost, to see those places where the Japanese take
siestas. Of all the writers who bemoan the passing in Japan, Richie
is the only one I know who's Japanese enough to see that in their
passing lies a good part of the beauty of most things.</TE>
<TE>   All I will say, rereading the book now, after 15 years in Japan
(and finding, as all of us do, that everyone who writes on the place
writes in his shadow and his debt), is that there's something in the
mizu-shobai, or water-trade (as the Japanese call the entertainment
centers of their cities), that seems to touch the core of him. The
cheerful celebration of illusion, the acceptance of human folly with
a surprising, engaging innocence, the very delight in evanescence and
the sadness and beauty it accompanies--all seem the essence of both
author and subject. "I heard the cicadas," as he writes, "the moment
they ceased." In the floating world Richie finds his perfect image of
a pleasure that remains just around the corner and of a beautiful
made-up world that gives you everything you want, and by virtue of
that giving, leaves you just a little bit unsatisfied.</TE>
<TE>   Richie writes, hauntingly, immortally, about the Japanese feeling
for sadness, their gift for being pleased, their thoughtfulness and
(as he puts it, elsewhere, of Kurosawa), their "knowing
tranquillity," and at some point one begins to realize that he's
writing of himself. This most gracious of guests has found his
kindred spirit in the most gracious of hosts. "The Inland Sea" (and
the title seems no coincidence) refers, as much as anything, to that
watery, wistful, half-vanished place inside himself. If you need to
understand this better, I suggest you turn to the book's epigraph,
taken from an old Japanese poem, and note how the "I" and the island
come together.</TE>

<LD>LEMONY SNICKET</LD>
<LD>   The Unauthorized Autobiography</LD>
<LD>   By Lemony Snicket</LD>
<TE>   HarperCollins: 240 pp., $11.99</TE>
<TE>   Acertain maniacal glee went into the creation of this archly
humorous volume. Beginning with the suggestion on the front flap of
the dust jacket to disguise its "dangerous" contents ("Make use of
this book's reversible jacket immediately"), readers will know
they're in possession of something deliciously left of normal. The
jacket reverses to display a hilarious parody of Snicket's "A Series
of Unfortunate Events" covers, titled "The Pony Party!" and featuring
"The Luckiest Kids in the World!" by Loney M. Setnick.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the contents lead readers on a merry goose chase. The
13 (naturally) chapters burst with red herrings, non sequiturs,
mysterious letters, diary entries and so on--not to mention fading
black-and-white photographs with captions such as "Total strangers"
and "W?H?O?" The narrative makes for a most satisfying tease, larded
with such Snicketisms as: "For various reasons, portions of this
chapter have been changed or made up entirely, including this
sentence."</TE>
<TE>   It would seem that Snicket's obituary from the highly unreliable
Daily Punctilio (which is reproduced in the book) is premature, and
that there will indeed be more installments about the Baudelaires,
though nothing is certain in the end and readers are left nearly as
in the dark about Snicket as they were at the start. Of course, this
is all part of the fun, guaranteed to make the author's fans itch to
get their hands on a copy of this devious romp masquerading as an
autobiography. (Ages 12 and up)</TE>

<TE>   FARMER SMART'S FAT CAT</TE>
<TE>   By James Sage</TE>
<TE>   Illustrated by Russell Ayto</TE>
<TE>   Chronicle Books: 26 pp., $14.95</TE>
<TE>   Their cornfields overrun by mice, two feuding farmers compete to
build the best mousetrap. " 'Those mice will soon learn who's boss
around here!' bragged Farmer Boast. 'With my invention they don't
stand a chance,' gloated Farmer Bluster."</TE>
<TE>   After the rodents mock their convoluted devices, which involve a
junkyard's worth of wheels, wire, old teakettles and wooden tools,
the tall, slouching Boast and red-bearded, gnomish Bluster beat a
path to Farmer Smart's mouse-free acreage. They plot to steal his big
orange tabby, but when they find her, "she's not quite so fat
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Smart's cat has had kittens, and each farmer gets one: problem
solved. Although the title divulges Smart's secret weapon, James Sage
("Where the Great Bear Watches") spends most of the book on Boast and
Bluster's rivalry; the cat's introduction is anticlimactic.</TE>
<TE>   Russell Ayto ("You'll Grow Soon, Alex"), whose sputtery, tense ink
line and eccentric characters recall Ronald Searle's and James Snow's
work, likewise fails to follow through on the dueling men and their
Rube Goldberg contraptions. When he abruptly shifts his focus to the
tranquil cat, she does little more than flex her claws. (Ages 4-7)</TE>

<TE>   PIG GIGGLES AND RABBIT RHYMES</TE>
<TE>   A Book of Animal Riddles</TE>
<TE>   By Mike Downs</TE>
<TE>   Illustrated by David Sheldon</TE>
<TE>   Chronicle Books: 26 pp., $13.95</TE>
<TE>   In this simple but sharp joint debut, Mike Downs and David Sheldon
make a game of rhyming word pairs. Each right-hand page asks two
questions and insinuates the answers in a crafty cartoon.</TE>
<TE>   For example, as a jaunty purple kangaroo and a rust-brown bird use
a boardwalk shower on a sunny stretch of beach, the text inquires,
"What do joeys use to wash their hair? / What do hooting birds use to
dry off?" The page's verso supplies the solutions in a curly
typeface: "Kangaroo shampoo / Owl towel." After a few tries, readers
will get the hang of guessing what "an octopus like[s] to sip" (ink
drink) or the name of "a crustacean musical group" (sand band).</TE>
<TE>   All told, Downs presents 20 riddles and a smattering of open-ended
jokes (a blue canine and a green amphibian on the title page wonder,
"What rhymes with dog?"). Resembling animation stills with their
undiluted colors and refined edges, Sheldon's splashy, nearly
three-dimensional illustrations add plenty of punchy fun. (Ages 4-8)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ONE HOT SECOND</TE>
<TE>   Stories About Desire</TE>
<TE>   Edited by Cathy Young</TE>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf: 218 pp., $10.95</TE>
<TE>   The title is more titillating than the content of this collection,
but there's truth in the 11 sometimes humorous, sometimes haunting,
short stories. The authors approach the topic of desire from a
variety of angles.</TE>
<TE>   The main character of Sarah Dessen's "Someone Bold," for example,
has lost 45 pounds, but has yet to shed the feeling of being
undesirable; in Victor Martinez's "The County Fair," race and class
intersect with attractiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Three entries focus on gay relationships, and one of them,
Jacqueline Woodson's lyrically wrought "Lorena," narrated by a New
York City girl whose lover overdoses, is among the standouts of the
volume: "[Death] takes away everywhere--a little bit of your mind
here, someone else's smile there, the quiet beauty of cappuccino with
lots of foam in an East Side cafe."</TE>
<TE>   In tonal contrast, the title entry, by Rachel Vail, hilariously
catches a ninth-grader relating her awkward first kiss and her
ensuing nausea over the thought of germs. Other contributors include
Angela Johnson, Nancy Garden, Rich Wallace and Ellen Witlinger. (Ages
12 and up)</TE>

<TE>   FROGGIE WENT A-COURTIN'</TE>
<TE>   By Iza Trapani</TE>
<TE>   Charlesbridge/Whispering</TE>
<TE>   Coyote: 32 pp., $15.95</TE>
<TE>   In this cleverly re-imagined version of the 400-year-old Scottish
folk song, wife-hungry Froggie doesn't have a sword and pistol by his
side, but his heart is definitely on his sleeve. Iza Trapani ("The
Itsy Bitsy Spider") focuses on Froggie's attempts at wooing, and she
sets the goings-on in a vaguely Edwardian era--a period that
dovetails nicely with the gentlemanly demeanor of her hero. In
Trapani's cozily detailed, pastel-hued watercolors, Froggie's a
dapper dresser and an earnest (not to mention chocolate-bearing)
suitor. But he makes the mistake of picking four non-amphibians in a
row as potential mates (the fetching Mousie of the traditional song,
then Turtle, Birdie and Chipmunk), and not even the flowery garlands
that enclose the lyrics can blunt the harshness of the ladies'
rejections. Says Birdie:</TE>
<TE>   I would think about it if you flew,</TE>
<TE>   But you smell of swamp; you're slimy too.</TE>
<TE>   No thanks, no thanks.</TE>
<TE>   The middle, text-less spread of the book finds Froggie in the
dumps and disconsolately reading a book titled "The Lonely Frog" in
bed. But his luck changes the next day when he spots "a vision by the
creek"--a lovely lady frog, who, in a nice feminist turn, pops the
question to him. The couple's sunlit formal wedding, with all the
former woo-ees as bridesmaids, is the very definition of Happily Ever
After. Music for the song is included on the last page. (Ages 2-7)</TE>

<HD>Stepping into California's Range of Light</HD>
<DH>THE HIGH SIERRA OF CALIFORNIA; By Gary Snyder and Tom
Killion; Heyday Books / Yosemite Assn.: 128 pp., $50</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch is a contributing writer to the Book
Review and the author of, most recently, "The Woman Who Laughed at
God: The Untold History of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beat poetry seems to boil up from the mean streets of America: "A
Coney Island of the Mind" is the allusive title of Lawrence
Ferlinghetti's most famous book of verse and Allen Ginsberg's "Howl"
famously evokes "the negro streets at dawn." Yet there is also a
pastoral tradition among the Beats, and it is richly evoked and
honored in "The High Sierra of California" by Gary Snyder and Tom
Killion.</LD>
<LD>   The book is an appropriate and highly elegant mating of Snyder's
poems and trail notes, excerpts from the writings of naturalist John
Muir and--above all--the superb and often stunning woodcuts of
printer and printmaker Killion.</LD>
<LD>   "My Sierra-eye was clearly shaped by the East Asian landscape
sensibility," writes Snyder, who worked as a logger, trail-crew
member and forest lookout when he wasn't studying Buddhism in a Zen
monastery in Japan. But the poet refuses to romanticize his own
youthful experience of the High Sierra: "Being tired, cold, and
hungry I didn't write all that much," he confesses, "and sometimes
what looks like the admirable brevity of haiku is probably just my
haste to put the pencil away and get some hot tea."</LD>
<TE>   Killion annotates his artwork with an extended essay in which he
explains the illuminating connection he finds between
Snyder--"certainly the most powerful, and certainly most influential,
contemporary voice to sing the poetry of the High Sierra"--and Muir,
the pioneering naturalist of the 19th century: "Today, Muir's vision
of the High Sierra as a resource for the soul is widely accepted,"
explains Killion, "but Snyder's insights into the relationship
between humanity and nature take us beyond Muir's, for Snyder looks
for the oneness of things beyond the mountain wilderness where Muir
sought it."</TE>
<TE>   Thus, for example, a woodcut by Killion titled "Cathedral Range"
accompanies a poem by Snyder from a journal entry dated Aug. 20,
1955.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wet rocks buzzing</TE>
<TE>   Rain and thunder southwest</TE>
<TE>   Hair, beard, tingle</TE>
<TE>   Wind whips bare legs</TE>
<TE>   We should go back</TE>
<TE>   We don't.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If there is a visual equivalent to Snyder's poetry, it is found in
Killion's hand-carved wood and linoleum block prints, each one
"created in the tradition of early nineteenth-century Japanese
ukiyo-e color landscape prints." Sometimes stately and solemn,
sometimes mysterious and mystical, sometimes rollicking and even
slightly ribald, the woodcuts are the real glory of "The High Sierra
of California."</TE>
<TE>   "The High Sierra of California" was originally produced by
Killion's Quail Press studio in Santa Cruz from 1997 to 2000 in an
edition of only 129 copies, each copy printed on handmade Japanese
paper, and something of the same handmade quality can be discerned in
the new edition from Heyday Books. Each of Killion's prints, 23 of
them in full color and many others in black and white, is reproduced
with the same passion and precision that can be found in the poetry
and prose that frame them.</TE>

<HD>Survival of the Prettiest</HD>
<DH>HOUSE UNDER SNOW: A Novel; By Jill Bialosky; Harcourt: 242
pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANCIE LIN</AU>
<BD>Francie Lin is the associate editor of the Threepenny
Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Willa Cather once observed that in the whole of literature, there are
really only two or three stories that repeat themselves over and over
again as fiercely as if they had never been written before. "House
Under Snow," a lucid, finely crafted first novel by acclaimed poet
Jill Bialosky, remains true to Cather's maxim, detailing in sharp,
textured prose the rise and fall of a doomed first love.</LD>
<LD>   The story concerns Anna Crane, a young girl growing up in Ohio
during the Vietnam era. Anna is the middle daughter of a family in
slow decline after the death of her father. Without the firm anchor
and touch of her husband, Anna's mother, Lilly, has devolved into an
erratic, willful ghost of a woman, convinced that her beauty is her
only recourse against loneliness and poverty. At once seductive and
pathetic, Lilly embarks on what Anna describes as a "dating career,"
neglecting her daughters in order to go out with violent men, abusive
men, men "who looked at her too long and made her crazy."</LD>
<TE>   Part of what makes Lilly's weakness as poignant as it is
infuriating is that its source lies in a dark lesson from family
history. Lilly's mother escaped the Nazis in World War II by dint of
her looks. " 'The priest told my mother's parents that he only had
room for one of their two daughters,' " she says to Anna. " 'My
mother was chosen because she was more beautiful. She later found out
that her sister Edith was killed by the Nazis the next day.' " Lilly
in turn passes on this idea of sexuality as a talisman against all
danger to her three young daughters. "[W]hen you don't come from
money, all you have is yourself," she tells Anna and her sisters.
"You must focus all your energy on becoming as beautiful as a
blossom, as perfect as a piece of fruit.... I was raised to believe
that for a Jew to fit in you had to make sure not to make your own
needs or presence too visible."</TE>
<TE>   Stifled by an atmosphere in which love and survival are contingent
upon something as fleeting as one's appearance, Anna longs for "a
kind of love that [is] impenetrable ... tough and enduring." What the
teenager finds is a boy named Austin whose "damaged and wild streak"
reminds her of her mother, and a tempestuous relationship ensues.
Bialosky captures the purity and desperation of adolescent love in
thick, sensual descriptions tinged by the wisdom of distance, since
the story is told by the adult Anna.</TE>
<TE>   Though beautifully written, "House Under Snow" is a little too
predictable. The dangerous young man (Austin is eventually drawn into
the underworld of gambling), the sensitive daughter, Lilly's boorish
men--even Anna's sisters--fulfill their stereotypes as the oldest and
youngest children without particular distinction. Except for Lilly,
the novel's characters are rather stock, and the betrayal that occurs
is therefore diminished; we can predict what's coming because we've
seen it before. Nevertheless, Bialosky, with her delicate touch and
clear eye for human frailty, is an author of talent, and "House Under
Snow" an elegant debut.</TE>

<HD>Unsentimental Journey</HD>
<DH>THE TROLLEY : A Novel; By Claude Simon , Translated from
the French by Richard Howard; The New Press: 110 pp., $22.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS McGONIGLE</AU>
<BD>Thomas McGonigle is the author of "The Corpse Dream of
N. Petkov" and "Going to Patchogue."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 88, Claude Simon, the French Nobel Prize winner, is more engaged
with the real world and more innovative in terms of form and content
in his books than many well-known writers half his age. His brief new
novel, "The Trolley," rendered in English by Richard Howard,
demonstrates all that is great about his works.</LD>
<LD>   "The Trolley" follows the journey of one of these quaint old
vehicles on its passage from the center of an unnamed town to a beach
in southern France. The trolley and its mechanical operations are
lovingly described in so much detail as to rescue the actual vehicle
from forgetfulness.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, our attention alternates between vignettes of a
schoolboy--surely Simon himself--riding the trolley through town and
a startling mosaic of memory: a complicated family history stretching
both in pride and shame from an aristocratic ancestor who voted for
the execution of the king during the French Revolution to Simon's
capture and escape during the German invasion at the beginning of
World War II.</LD>
<TE>   Yet, in between these memories, the eye of the narrator does not
miss the motorman's cigarette butt, "stuck to his lower lip for the
entire journey ... a stubby grayish tube of saliva-steeped paper."
Nor does he give us a clear sense of cause and effect: We wonder, are
the memories of the trolley provoked by a sign reading "transit,"
which the aging narrator glimpses while he is in a hospital,
subjected to the horrors of modern medicine?</TE>
<TE>   One doesn't know the answer, for the narrative possesses a
delicious ambiguity. For many years, Simon has blurred the line
between fiction and autobiography not from a vulgar desire to reveal
some dreary salacious sexual activity about himself, but to overcome
the difficulty of seeing through words the world and a person's place
in it. In this, "The Trolley" is perhaps the most accessible of his
many books in its brevity and clear focus.</TE>
<TE>   Description of a Simon book is always far more complicated than
the actual book. Everything rests on the clarity of description,
which sometimes jars, as when the story's narrator recalls a
disturbing moment in his childhood when the family maid is "killing
one after the other the kittens of her cat's incessant litters,
flinging them violently against the courtyard wall, picking up the
tiny sticky balls of bloody hair if they still moved, flinging them
against the wall again and then dumping them on the compost heap out
of a basket which she then rinsed several times until there was no
trace of blood left in it."</TE>
<TE>   Or else, there is a passage in which the narrator acknowledges
that it is not only his task to describe but also to penetrate the
veil that separates the past from the present: "the stifling
immobility of the air in which there always seemed to be floating
that hanging veil which no breath of wind stirred, slowly sinking,
covering with a uniform shroud the leafy rose-laurels, the
sun-scorched lawns, the faded irises and the basin of stagnant water
under its impalpable layer of ashes, the impalpable and protecting
mist of memory."</TE>
<TE>   In these moments of distraction and distortion, Simon has modeled
in "The Trolley" a sensuous--and scrupulous--attitude toward the
world, and it is heartening to be not so alone.</TE>

<HD>Racism Unleashed</HD>
<DH>WHEN VICTIMS BECOME KILLERS: Colonialism, Nativism and the
Genocide in Rwanda; By Mahmood Mamdani;  Princeton University Press:
364 pp., $29.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA MELVERN</AU>
<BD>Linda Melvern is the author of "A People Betrayed: The
Role of the West in Rwanda's Genocide."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the course of a few terrible months in 1994, up to 1 million
people were killed in Rwanda in a systematic slaughter not, as many
newspapers reported at the time, as a result of chaotic and tribal
civil war but as a deliberate government policy that was a carefully
planned strategy, designed in advance and mobilizing thousands of
unemployed youth into militias.</LD>
<LD>   How could the world community allow such mass killing to happen?
The opportunity for genocide was provided by a conjunction of
circumstances allowing the hardliners to confuse the international
community while they perpetrated the crime. All countries should have
severed ties with Rwanda and expelled its ambassadors. But the
organizers of genocide remained safe in the knowledge that outside
interference would be at a minimum. No one gave the conspirators
reason to pause.</LD>
<LD>   The genocide in Rwanda was the first post-World War II
extermination to be genuinely comparable to the Holocaust. It is one
of the great scandals of the last century and, despite numerous
inquiries and a growing body of literature, there are significant
gaps in our knowledge about what happened.</LD>
<TE>   "When Victims Become Killers, " by Ugandan scholar Mahmood
Mamdani, promises to explain the genocide through an understanding of
citizenship and political identity in post-colonial Africa. But the
book disappoints readers, failing even to expose one of the most
central aspects, the growth of Hutu Power, the racist ideology that
underpinned the genocide.</TE>
<TE>   In Rwanda, there had been a history of state-sponsored and
institutionalized racism against the minority Tutsis. Rwanda's 7
million people were divided into three ethnic groups: the Hutus,
roughly 85%; the Tutsis, 14%; and the Twa, 1%. The law required that
all Rwandans be registered according to ethnic group, and the
genocide of the Tutsis would become the centerpiece of state
doctrine.</TE>
<TE>   The genesis of the racist ideology that became known as Hutu Power
was in northern Rwanda, in the regions of Gisenyi and Ruhengeri. The
northern Hutus were fiercely independent and believed themselves to
be distinct from the Hutus in the south. The northern kingdoms had
been independent until the first decade of the 20th century, when the
German military defeated them with Tutsi-led troops drawn from the
south. In the north there was considerable bitterness. A detailed
history of Hutu Power has yet to be written, but the name did not
surface until 1992 in extremist circles at a time when the idea of a
"big cleanup" took hold to solve the "Tutsi problem."</TE>
<TE>   Mamdani's focus, however, is elsewhere. For him, the most
troubling question is the genocide's popularity. "My main objective
in writing this book is to make the popular agency in the Rwandan
genocide thinkable," he writes. He is at pains to explain the
large-scale civilian involvement in the killing. And he loses sight
of the great influence of Hutu Power's propaganda machine on the
peasants. The effectiveness of Hutu Power radio, with its catchy
nationalistic theme tunes and racist jingles, must never be
underestimated. The broadcasts of Radio-Television Libre des Mille
Collines ("the free radio of a thousand hills," the name for Rwanda)
played an integral role in the plot.</TE>
<TE>   In genocide it is necessary to promote a racist ideology and
define the victims as being outside human existence to legitimize any
act, no matter how horrendous. We may never know when the Hutu Power
conspirators first conceived of the plan, when the northern
oligarchs, threatened by democracy and power-sharing, decided to use
genocide as a political weapon. By the time it began, the youth
militia had grown to 30,000 and there were about 85 tons of weapons
and agricultural tools distributed all over the country.</TE>
<TE>   Mamdani concludes that neither greed nor hatred persuaded the
people of Rwanda to kill. Nor was it unquestioning obedience. It was
fear: fear of a return to servitude and a conviction that they, the
Hutu masses, were the victims of yesterday, and that the Tutsis,
their former rulers in pre-colonial and colonial days, would turn
them into victims once more.</TE>
<TE>   Mamdani gives the impression that the genocide was an extremist
manifestation of civil war. This denies the genocide its status, and
Hutu Power cannot be described as just another extremist political
tendency. The conspirators who unleashed the terror have yet to see
their day in court, and only then will the world finally learn the
details of their genocidal plotting.</TE>
<TE>   Raphael Lemkin, the father of the 1948 Genocide Convention,
believed that genocide could be predicted and prevented. Lemkin had
argued that genocide was most likely to occur where there was racism
and that the more extreme the racism, the more likely a genocide
would take place. Lemkin believed that genocide was ever present and
that it "followed humanity like a dark shadow, from antiquity to the
present time."</TE>
<TE>   Mamdani does not mention Lemkin in the brief history of genocide
included in "When Victims Become Killers," but he does cite the
genocide of the Herero people in German South West Africa in 1904.
The German military, faced with continuing armed resistance, had
prepared to exterminate as many Herero as possible. Those people left
alive were put in concentration camps, where a German geneticist,
Eugen Fischer, did medical experiments on race.</TE>
<TE>   One of his prominent students in later years was Josef Mengele,
who carried out experiments at Auschwitz. Mamdani argues that modern
genocide was nurtured in the colonies, and although the genocidal
impulse to eliminate an enemy may indeed be as old as organized
power, he believes it was European "race branding" that made it
possible to exterminate an enemy with an easy conscience.</TE>
<TE>   The race idea, Mamdani argues, was conceived in Europe. Europe was
also the land of its prehistory and its culmination. Mamdani suggests
that the idea that Tutsis and Hutus were different races had come
with the European colonizers. It was the colonizer who thought up the
idea that the Tutsis had "invaded" a country that "belonged" to the
Hutus. The Hutu extremists used this version of history during the
genocide, portraying Tutsis as "aliens."</TE>
<TE>   Mamdani describes how the horror of colonialism led to two types
of genocidal impulse: the genocide of the native by the settler and
the native impulse to eliminate the settler. The genocide in Rwanda,
he argues, needs to be understood as a natives' genocide, but he does
not even speculate on the possibility that genocide may have already
been a feature of pre-colonial Africa. After all, the prime symbol of
Tutsi power is the Kalinga drum, which was said to be a reminder of
Hutu inferiority, for it was decorated with the penises of defeated
Hutu kings, signifying the rivals' complete defeat, surely a powerful
genocidal symbol.</TE>
<TE>   In Rwanda in 1994, a plan to eliminate the Tutsis was methodically
and thoroughly pursued. Only by understanding how and why this
happened can there ever be any hope for the future. "When Victims
Become Killers," however, helps little in that process.</TE>

<DH>THE TURK: The Life and Times of the Famous
Eighteenth-Century Chess-Playing Machine; By Tom Standage; Walker &amp;
Co.: 272 pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRUCE PANDOLFINI</AU>
<BD>Bruce Pandolfini is the author of the forthcoming "The
Diagonal Mind" and other books on chess, including "Kasparov and Deep
Blue." He was the real-life inspiration for the chess instructor in
"Searching for Bobby Fischer."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During the Age of Enlightenment, a number of scientists experimented
with a tantalizing problem: Could the human brain be mimicked
mechanically? One such inventor was Wolfgang von Kempelen, scientist,
founder of experimental phonetics and counselor to Empress Maria
Theresa of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During his creative lifetime,
Von Kempelen designed bridges, experimented with steam engines and
devised machines that "spoke."</LD>
<LD>   Well aware of the public's enchantment with the idea of a thinking
machine, Von Kempelen played a trick on the brightest of his
contemporaries. When he unveiled his human-like curio, which he
called "the Turk," the life-size figure dressed in ermine-trimmed
robe and turban amazed the court by playing chess.</LD>
<LD>   "The Turk," written by Tom Standage, technology correspondent for
the Economist, is a history of that automaton, which consisted of a
wooden mannequin seated behind a cabinet some 4 feet long, 2 1/2 feet
deep and 3 feet high. A chessboard was attached to the tabletop.
Given an opponent, a dramatic presentation and a wind-up, the Turk
competed against some notable players, including Benjamin Franklin,
Napoleon Bonaparte and the greatest chess-player of the time,
Francois-Andre Danican Philidor. The Turk traveled across Europe and
parts of America for decades, giving deceptive proof of its
chess-playing prowess.</LD>
<TE>   Standage's account begins with the 18th century rage for
contraptions that produced singing birds, flute-playing statues and
even a duck that quacked, ate and digested its food in full view of
the audience. No wonder the Viennese court turned out in 1769 for
similar practical proof of scientific progress when a Monsieur
Pelletier, a visiting lecturer of sorts, attested to the superiority
of French learning with an entertaining mix of staged exhibitions,
automata and conjuring tricks. Provoked by the Frenchman's arrogance,
Von Kempelen told Maria Theresa that he could build a machine more
surprising than anything the empress had just seen.</TE>
<TE>   He did. The Turk seemed a giant technical step forward, and the
automaton's apparent ability to master the complexities of the
chessboard inspired other inventors. Upon seeing the Turk in action,
Edmund Cartwright tackled the development of a mechanical loom.
Charles Babbage, who created the forerunner of the digital computer,
may have disputed that the Turk was a reasoning machine, but he was
nevertheless convinced one could be developed and sketched out his
computational procedure for a machine that might someday play chess.</TE>
<TE>   Observers alternately described the Turk either as proof of
inventive brilliance or as an elaborate, if ingenious, hoax (Edgar
Allan Poe demonstrated that he belonged to the latter group in his
essay "Maelzel's Chess-Player"). Standage surveys nearly eight
decades of inevitable conflict between the Turk's supporters and
critics. Despite many close encounters with observers who correctly
speculated that a human operator was the chess-playing brain behind
the Turk, enough hard-headed analysts concurred with delighted
onlookers, satisfied that the Turk played chess wholly independently
and intelligently.</TE>
<TE>   Standage connects scientists across the centuries, and the result
is pleasantly thought-provoking. Von Kempelen operated on the same
premise as 20th century British computer scientist and cryptographer
Alan Turing: that human intelligence was best simulated and revealed
through communication or chess-playing.</TE>
<TE>   We know that computers power through complex chess problems or
linguistic tasks with massive mathematical muscle-flexing. By 1997,
Deep Blue, IBM's chess-playing computer, could analyze 200 million
chess positions per second. But while chess-playing computers succeed
as calculators, they fall short in making creative judgments.
Programs that imitate chess-play or produce speech cannot yet replace
the human mind. And still we go on asking the obvious question: Can a
machine ever be made that will rival, let alone best, the human
brain? It's the thought that counts.</TE>
<TE>   The Turk was a beguiling illusion. A concealed human operator did
the actual playing. He alternately curled up and stretched out inside
the cabinet as doors were opened at the beginning of the performance
to prove it was empty. Once the doors were closed, he sat, though
uncomfortably, in the main compartment.</TE>
<TE>   With the creation of the Turk, Von Kempelen knew he was foisting a
canard on Europe's elite. But for the most part, the deception
worked, even though rational minds surmised that an automaton could
not be capable of the ingenuity the Turk displayed. The show was too
good to be true and a number of astute eyewitnesses explained why the
Turk wasn't playing and a human being was. Eventually, after a later
owner died, the Turk was sold to Dr. John Kearsley Mitchell (Poe's
physician), who managed to put the disassembled marvel's many parts
back together and verify how right they were.</TE>
<TE>   Why would people want to believe that a machine could be capable
of insightful thought over a chessboard? Why does a machine with even
the appearance of human qualities intrigue us? And why are humans
interested in the development of comparable intelligence? Do we
believe that, if we can create something like the human brain, we
will finally understand it? If we can build a machine to incarnate
what is human, could we then cheat mortality?</TE>
<TE>   Chess, Standage writes, has been regarded as a touchstone of
intelligence. Indeed, one of the reasons why the Turk was so
enthralling is that the game's appeal transcends any knowledge about
it. Even for nonplayers, chess symbolizes the mind's ability to come
to grips with new situations, complex problems, even emotions
unleashed by some cunning and determined opponent. More than a test,
chess is a metaphor that plays out the realities of life: challenge
and contest, struggle and defeat, foreseeing and comprehending the
future. Because chess stands for so much, it can mean something even
for those who know little about the game.</TE>
<TE>   Standage leaves it to others to explain how and why the
chess-playing automaton artificially embodied human curiosity about
the nature of the human mind. The Turk both captivated and fooled
eager spectators, and we keep coming back for more. It's not the
engineering that's primarily fascinating, it's we, the people. Nobody
gives any thought to devising a human that plays chess like a
machine. But a machine behaving like a human to explain us to
ourselves--that's the true magical spell of the Turk.</TE>

<TE>   From 'The Turk'</TE>
<TE>   Napoleon's encounter with the Turk is easily the most famous
episode in its career.... "The automaton was seated in front of a
table on which a chessboard was arranged for a game," wrote
[Napoleon's valet] Constant. "His Majesty took a chair, and sitting
down opposite the automaton, said, laughing: 'Come on, comrade;
here's to us two.' The automaton saluted and made a sign with the
hand to the Emperor, as if to bid him begin.</TE>
<TE>   "The game opened, the Emperor made two or three moves, and
intentionally a false one. The automaton bowed, took up the piece and
put it back in its place. His Majesty cheated a second time; the
automaton saluted again, but confiscated the piece. "That's right,"
said His Majesty, and cheated the third time. Then the automaton
shook its head, and passing its hand over the chessboard, it upset
the whole game. The Emperor complimented the mechanician highly."</TE>

<DH>OUTLAW WOMAN: A Memoir of the War Years, 1960-1975; By
Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz; City Lights Books:  412 pp., $17.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PLATT</AU>
<BD>Tony Platt is the coauthor of "The Iron Fist and the
Velvet Glove: An Analysis of the U.S. Police," published in 1975,
and, more recently, "E. Franklin Frazier Reconsidered." He is a
professor of social work at Cal State Sacramento.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I had not expected to live to be thirty-six years old," writes
Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz in "Outlaw Woman: A Memoir of the War Years,
1960-1975," a panoramic look back at her experiences in the trenches
of the American left during one of this country's most volatile
political eras. In the early 1960s Dunbar-Ortiz had given up her
graduate studies at UCLA and hit the road. She was tired of trying to
infiltrate academia's old boys' club and being groped by the chairman
of her doctoral committee. By the time she returned to Los Angeles in
the mid-1970s to complete her doctorate in history, she had acquired
real-world credentials as a revolutionary feminist.</LD>
<LD>   Dunbar-Ortiz counted among her allies the 11% of American
university students who described themselves as radical leftists in a
1970 Life magazine survey. Unlike most of the New Left's middle-class
activists, however, she was a "dirt-poor half-breed" from rural
Oklahoma who grew up with the firsthand experience of exploitative
jobs as a secretary in San Francisco, hospital clerk in Lake Tahoe,
factory worker in New Orleans and "slots change girl" in Nevada.</LD>
<TE>   This book is not for those looking for an analysis of why the
second American revolution failed, but there is no better
experiential account of what propelled her (and my) generation of
activists into an "irreversible direction and life-time commitment,"
as she termed it at a recent San Francisco book reading.
Dunbar-Ortiz, a professor of ethnic studies and women's studies at
Cal State Hayward, threads historical contexts and expressive prose
into a chronological narrative relieved by diary entries, excerpts
from letters, reconstructed conversations and newspaper accounts. We
are transported into the cultural-political ferment of Marxist study
groups, international solidarity campaigns, black liberation rallies,
rock concerts and be-ins, antiwar demonstrations, a trip to Cuba with
the Venceremos Brigade and underground cells. "I felt like the
luckiest person in the world," she concludes. "I was a part of
history in the making."</TE>
<TE>   But her personal life was anything but lucky. The story begins
where her first autobiographical book, "Red Dirt: Growing Up Okie,"
ends: leaving the hardscrabble landscape and "cauldron of hatred and
meanness" that was home in Oklahoma. Her father, Moyer Haywood
Pettibone Dunbar, named for her grandfather's Industrial Workers of
the World (or Wobbly) heroes, ironically turned into an embittered
supporter of George Wallace, while her part-Cherokee mother
degenerated into an out-of-control drunk who terrorized Roxanne into
running away from home in her junior year of high school.</TE>
<TE>   She never looked back, never reconciled with her parents, but the
brutality of her past haunted the next "decade of rootlessness" and
warped her personal life. With her first husband, she created what
she called a "prison of marriage." Later, a drug-dealing lover turned
her on to shoplifting. Her second husband tried to make her into a
compliant wife. And in the early 1970s, a recognized leader of
radical feminism, she again found herself "in the world of the
damned"--strung out on booze, living with a construction worker who
beat her bloody when she got too uppity. Dunbar-Ortiz writes about
this time in her life without rancor and is generous to men trapped
in misogyny. She finds no pathos in her victimization, nor does she
write to expiate her past or settle old scores. What is surprisingly
missing from her memoir, however, is any reflection about why she was
repeatedly attracted to personal relationships and political
organizations, such as the Revolutionary Union, that contradicted her
feminist principles.</TE>
<TE>   The core of the book follows Dunbar-Ortiz's efforts to forge a
radical practice rooted in the lives of working-class women. If
Simone de Beauvoir's "The Second Sex" first introduced her to the
ideas of feminism, it was Valerie Solanas' failed attempt to kill
Andy Warhol in 1968 that connected her to women's rage. "I saw
madness in Valerie's eyes," she said after visiting the author of the
SCUM (Society for Cutting Up Men) manifesto in jail. "I saw my
mother's eyes." The author draws upon her own bitter experiences to
explain why she chose to participate in building a women's movement
that would be "part of a global revolution against greed, patriarchy,
capitalism, imperialism, and racism." She had little patience for
NOW's middle-class feminism or the macho posturing of the extreme
left. "[W]e were an outlaw faction," she observes, "trapped somewhere
between the mainstream and the embarrassing Weatherwomen."</TE>
<TE>   Working in Boston with a group of like-minded feminists,
Dunbar-Ortiz helped to produce No More Fun and Games, an influential
journal that was widely read in women's study groups in the late
1960s and early 1970s. The organization that she helped form, Female
Liberation, "favored the non-elitist method of organizing" and was
initially committed to collective forms of leadership. With a
reputation as an intellectual activist who promoted self-defense
training for women, Dunbar-Ortiz was wary of "[r]evolutionary
organizations made up of mostly privileged whites" that tended to
"exoticize the working class and people of color." Nor was she amused
by the slogan used by the conscientious objectors' movement to
recruit GIs--"girls say yes to boys who say no." Her encounters with
the sexism of male heavies in the antiwar movement made her worry
that "fascism was not limited to the right wing."</TE>
<TE>   The media stardom that Dunbar-Ortiz's circle so distrusted soon
catapulted her into the public eye. Photographed in a tae kwon do
pose by Diane Arbus and given prominent coverage in Time, Life and
Newsweek, by 1970 she was able to earn a living off speaking
engagements around the country. When she moved to New Orleans to
organize Southern women, she also gained a following among FBI
agents, local red squads and police informers who infiltrated her
group, the Southern Female Rights Union. Months of harassment and
surveillance, she recalls, took their toll on her sanity and sense of
security. For a brief time in 1970-71, "caught up in a current of
repression and paranoia," she went underground, moved to a safe house
and joined the National Rifle Assn. Her group, which had "clearly
fallen under the spell of guns"--not unlike the Symbionese Liberation
Army and Black Panthers--flirted with the idea of sabotaging
Louisiana's oil industries. "I lost my bearings for a time," she
admits. "I was about to make some very unwise choices."</TE>
<TE>   By 1973, realizing that her life was endangered by a "nihilistic,
even suicidal, mission," Dunbar-Ortiz had abandoned her brutal
boyfriend and clandestine adventurism. She moved back to California,
where she found a new political home in the American Indian Movement
and cultural solace in her deranged mother's roots. But feminism
remained a central force in her life. She celebrated the end of the
Vietnam War in April 1975, knowing that she had been a participant in
"something deeper and more radical than ever before in history: Women
of all ages and backgrounds rose up and would not be put down."</TE>
<TE>   The book concludes, unfortunately, on a false note of bravado. In
a perfunctory epilogue--written after Sept. 11, but with no reference
to its consequences--Dunbar-Ortiz expresses her disappointment that
efforts to "eradicate capitalism, patriarchy, racism and war ...
didn't turn out that way. Not yet." Today, she observes, we face the
same problems of war and inequality that "confronted us during the
Vietnam period.... Our project as socially conscious beings must be,
as it was during the war years, nothing less than the total
transformation of human societies."</TE>
<TE>   Though I share this hope, I think it is also incumbent on leftists
of my generation to understand how dramatically the world has changed
since the 1960s and why the 20th century utopian models have failed
us. A post-Cold War world, marked by the demise of communism,
economic polarization and the precarious ascendancy of the United
States as the sole superpower, requires new ways of imagining social
equality and of mobilizing revolutionary change. Moreover, we have a
responsibility to the next generation of activists to explain why a
movement devoted to social justice reproduced within its own
organizations so much that was antithetical to democracy and how we
both escaped from and remain enmeshed in our past.</TE>

<LD>REACH</LD>
<LD>   Finding Strength, Spirit, and Personal Power</LD>
<LD>   By Laila Ali with David Ritz</LD>
<TE>   Hyperion: 182 pp., $21.95</TE>
<TE>   Laila Ali's swan dive into juvenile delinquency can make a reader
keenly aware of the precariousness of a child's world. The daughter
of an international hero, Muhammad Ali, Laila--who was born in
1977--and her older sister Hanna grew up in the most privileged
atmosphere L.A. had to offer. But she was terrified all the time: of
the strangers in her house; of the distance, physical and emotional,
between herself and her parents; of the Muslim prayers she and her
sister were forced to say in a foreign language.</TE>
<TE>   Laila was molested at 5 and 11 by visiting relatives. There was no
one to tell. Her parents were distracted, first by fame, then by
divorce. She got into schoolyard fights and finally stealing. She was
pregnant at 16. At 17, she was arrested for credit card fraud and
sent to juvenile jail for three months. From there, the judge sent
her to a placement home, where she heard stories worse than her own.
Once out, she found her talent, which lay, to everyone's surprise, in
boxing. In 1999, Laila fought her first professional fight. The story
is gripping, the writing upbeat but sometimes trite, and the success
too sudden (Ali is 24). "Reach" is a book on the edge.</TE>

<TE>   ON WHALE ISLAND</TE>
<TE>   Notes From a Place I Never Meant to Leave</TE>
<TE>   By Daniel Hayes</TE>
<TE>   Algonquin Books: 240 pp., $22.95</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Hayes' easygoing humor barely masks his obsession with a
50-acre island off the coast of Nova Scotia, which he bought instead
of going to medical school. He is, by nature, a recluse, a married
recluse with a 9-year-old stepson. On the surface, "On Whale Island"
is a well-told tale of the year he and his family went to live on the
island. But Hayes is running from as much as he is running to.</TE>
<TE>   "I've not been able to convince them that the world is ending," he
writes, barely joking, "so there is a certain urgency lacking in
their whole attitude." He is honest in describing his struggle with
stepparenthood. At year's end, the family returns to Idaho (as they
had previously agreed), and Hayes, in the book's epilogue, sounds
miserable.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike creators of Hollywood movies, editors of books usually do
not insist on happy endings. Still, some people are strongly called
by place and are only half themselves elsewhere. Hayes may be one of
these people.</TE>

<TE>   IF THE SPIRIT MOVES YOU</TE>
<TE>   Life and Love After Death</TE>
<TE>   By Justine Picardie</TE>
<TE>   Riverhead Books: 258 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   There is a wind in "If the Spirit Moves You," a door opening in
space, a feeling that comes not from the writing, which is cramped by
the author's pain and by her years as a journalist. Justine Picardie
lost her sister Ruth to cancer. After three years of nightmares and
longing, she began this book. As the editor of the Observer magazine,
Picardie gave Ruth a chance to write about dying. The immensely
popular columns were collected into a bestselling book: "Before I Say
Goodbye."</TE>
<TE>   In her travels doing publicity for the book, Picardie seeks out
experts who communicate in various ways with the dead. She wants a
sign that her sister is not lost to her. The book is framed in diary
entries between Good Friday 2000 and Easter Sunday 2001, interspersed
with quotes from Scriptures and from "A Dictionary of Superstitions."</TE>
<TE>   It is a scary book, in spite of its purposeful tone. A reader
feels the resistance to approaching that other world. Hearing voices,
Picardie's husband reminds her, is considered a sign of
schizophrenia. Along with Picardie, we want a sign from Ruth, but we
dread it.</TE>

<TE>   LONGING</TE>
<TE>   By Gunnar Kopperud</TE>
<TE>   Translated from the Norwegian</TE>
<TE>   by Christopher Jamieson</TE>
<TE>   Bloomsbury: 250 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   "Longing is for something you hope is coming, loss is for
something you know has gone." In this fierce novel, an Italian war
correspondent finds himself in love with a young, female Iranian
soldier who has been raised traditionally to marry whomever her
parents choose and to never look a man in the eye. They meet in a
trench, and we never learn their names or how they got to the point
at which they meet.</TE>
<TE>   In books, as in relationships, there is a trade-off between
atmospheric silence and trust. Sometimes the gaps in information
enter a reader's consciousness more effectively than detail.
Sometimes it is the detail that cements the author-reader
relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "Longing" is written from the point of view of each lover, which
sets up a longing for the two to merge as they travel and fight--two
objects hurling toward each other in the space between the book's
covers.</TE>

<DH>THE EMPEROR AND THE WOLF: The Lives and Films of Akira
Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune; By Stuart Galbraith IV; Faber &amp; Faber:
826 pp., $40 / SEVEN SAMURAI; By Joan Mellen; BFI Film Classics /
University of California Press: 96 pp., $12.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SCHICKEL</AU>
<BD>Richard Schickel is a contributing writer to Book
Review and a film critic for Time magazine. His television series,
"The Men Who Made the Movies," is running every Tuesday this month on
Turner Classic Movies.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The partnership between Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune is one of
the screen's great director-actor collaborations. Between 1948
("Drunken Angel") and 1965 ("Red Beard"), they made 16 films
together, some of them--"Rashomon," "Seven Samurai," "Yojimbo," "High
and Low"--among the masterpieces of world cinema in the post-World
War II era. In the introduction to "The Emperor and the Wolf," his
endless dual biography of these two artists, Stuart Galbraith IV
evokes John Ford and John Wayne, Ingmar Bergman and Max Von Sydow,
Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro for comparison's sake, and the
analogies are by no means misplaced.</LD>
<LD>   Yet these comparisons falter at a crucial point. Unlike their
peers, Kurosawa and Mifune stopped working together after "Red Beard"
(which also belongs on the list of their finest films), despite the
fact that Kurosawa went on directing until 1993, and the increasingly
marginalized Mifune continued acting until 1996. The question of what
went wrong between these two proud and mysterious men haunts all
considerations of their lives and work. It is the question that
Galbraith fails to answer.</LD>
<TE>   Possibly that's because there is no answer, except a sort of
existential drift in different directions that was occasioned by two
factors. One was the chaos that came upon the Japanese film industry
in the '60s (organized, in imitation of the industrialized American
system, around biggish studios) when television, international
finance and celebrity folly struck with a crushing impact. The other
was that Kurosawa and Mifune were--despite being taller than the
typical Japanese and sharing a lack of formal education and a
propensity for strong drink at the height of their careers--totally
opposite personalities.</TE>
<TE>   Kurosawa claimed a samurai heritage and, more immediately, a
downwardly trending middle-class background. He trained as an artist,
but once he found his way to film (he was an assistant director and
screenwriter in the prewar and wartime years), he became an austere
and driven man, difficult to approach, essentially humorless. He
often had to shut down production because his intensity made him ill.
He was very much the "emperor" of Galbraith's title and was so called
by his casts and crews.</TE>
<TE>   Mifune was entirely different. Yes, people thought of him as the
"wolf" because of his demonic screen presence. But he was, in fact,
an agreeable, accommodating man, eschewing entourages and
pretentiousness. Of the working class, he had served in the war as an
aerial cameraman (though never under fire) and thereafter went to
Toho, Japan's most important studio, looking for photographic work.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he was placed in a "new faces" program at the studio
where everyone, Kurosawa included, was struck by the intensity of his
acting. "Mifune had a talent I had never encountered before,"
Kurosawa once said. "It was above all the speed with which he
expressed himself that was astounding. The ordinary Japanese actor
might need ten feet of film to get across an impression; Mifune
needed only three feet."</TE>
<TE>   In short, he had what Kurosawa needed: the instinctive intensity
to shake up and humanize with humor, athleticism and basic good
nature the director's rather austere films. In return, Kurosawa
offered Mifune something he could not find elsewhere: roles with a
kind of intellectual coherence. The samurai Mifune played for him
were all ronin, the Japanese word for members of a doomed (and, by
Kurosawa, deeply mourned) soldierly class who had been cut loose from
their masters and now wandered the countryside, freelancing their
deadly skills while trying to retain their complex code of honor.</TE>
<TE>   When Mifune worked in modern middle-class garb for Kurosawa--"High
and Low," "The Bad Sleep Well"--issues of honor and correct behavior
in morally ambivalent circumstances remained central to the film.
Kurosawa was something of an anti-Communist, ever a humanist, ever
attuned (doubtless because of his family's fall from economic grace)
to class issues. In Mifune's edginess, anger and puzzlement in the
face of social forces he could not comprehend, he had found the
perfect embodiment of his major preoccupations.</TE>
<TE>   Whereupon, the '60s--recasting class issues in new
terms--happened. More to the point of these lives, both Kurosawa and
Mifune were now internationally known figures. The latter--with
Kurosawa disapproving--opened his own studio and sold himself short
in all kinds of films--the good, the bad, the irrelevant--in order to
support it. He appeared, amazingly, in 126 of them (not counting
television work). Latterly, he was often to be found standing around
in military epics, playing generals and admirals (the tragic Isoruko
Yamamato, reluctant architect of the Pearl Harbor attack, was a
particular specialty).</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Kurosawa, whose work had been deeply influenced by
Western film and literary influences (Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, and,
yes, Evan Hunter), was lured into feckless attempts to make
Western-financed films ("Runaway Train" and "Tora Tora Tora" most
notably). When, after these failures, a return to Japanese themes
(the flawed but nevertheless underrated "Dodes'ka-den") also flopped,
he attempted suicide and made only one film (in the USSR) in the
'70s, before returning to something like his past form with his epics
of the early '80s, "Kagemusha" and "Ran."</TE>
<TE>   These films, supported by admiring younger American filmmakers
(Lucas, Coppola, Scorsese), are very beautiful and carry intense
meaning in their imagery and the way it is orchestrated. But, yes,
they could have used Mifune's energizing presence, if by then he was
capable of mobilizing it.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Kurosawa and Mifune had, each in his way, become ronin
himself, roaming an empty world in search of work worthy of his
gifts. In this they were both disadvantaged by their inability to
speak any language but Japanese. And the mutual contempt in which
Kurosawa and the Japanese press held each other--the critics
mistrusted his reliance on occidental source material, the ease with
which foreign critics accepted him and the fact that his work was so
casually (if often clumsily) knocked off by American and European
directors--leaked westward and rendered Kurosawa even more remote and
difficult to approach. Through the years, rumors of a reunion between
Kurosawa and Mifune occasionally surfaced, though nothing came of
them. Indeed, Galbraith, try as he may, can find no evidence of a
definitive quarrel or unforgivable break between them. With one
exception--a Mifune outburst--they always spoke well of each other.
Their breach remains a mystery, a sadness to us in the audience, an
incalculable loss to film history.</TE>
<TE>   This loss is blatantly visible to Galbraith, but he can only mourn
it, not analyze it. He seems to be one of those mad-fact collectors
who shovels useless information in lieu of thoughtful insight. Joan
Mellen, in her wee essay (one of the invaluable British Film
Institute series about the world's most significant films) does
better. She may devote too much space to a shot-by-shot analysis of
"Seven Samurai's" key sequences, thereby imparting excessive
intentionality to the often accidental processes of movie making, and
she falls to quarreling with younger Japanese critics who cannot
grasp Kurosawa's towering strengths.</TE>
<TE>   But eventually she makes the case for his humanism, for the sheer
kinetic and moral power of his best work, for his near-tragic
class-consciousness, which far transcended narrowing ideology. He was
a great master--and Mifune was his great instrument--precisely for
the reasons the Japanese have most often criticized them: because
their ability to universalize complex emotions make them instantly
movingly recognizable to disparate cultures the world over.</TE>

<DH>SNOBBERY: The American Version, By Joseph Epstein, Houghton
Mifflin: 274 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN SIMON</AU>
<BD>John Simon is the theater critic for New York magazine
and music critic for The New Leader. His most recent book is
"Dreamers of Dreams: Essays on Poets and Poetry."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some books are necessary, some are wonderful, few are both. In that
select group belongs Joseph Epstein's "Snobbery: The American
Version." I would rank it with works by Alexis de Tocqueville and
Thorstein Veblen, except that it is more timely than the former's and
infinitely more amusing than the latter's. It is one of the rare
books that entertain as much as they teach.</LD>
<LD>   For years Epstein has labored valiantly in several venues: as
editor, literature teacher, book critic and, perhaps best of all,
personal essayist. The personal essay, in which one writes a
thoughtful epistle to one's fellows on a variety of subjects, is an
endangered species. But those who can appreciate this intimate,
reflective, civilized genre are company as fit as they are few.
Epstein's dozen or so collections of such essays have been eagerly
awaited and blissfully savored by the sophisticated and whoever else
felicitously chanced upon them.</LD>
<LD>   With "Snobbery," Epstein undertakes a book-length essay in a
series of interconnected essays, each of two dozen chapters
addressing a different type of snobbery. The amazingly alert and
perceptive author pursues snobbishness from its spotlighted stages to
its hidden breeding grounds and discovers striking varieties in
crannies the rest of us would have overlooked.</LD>
<TE>   In the chapter on gastronomic snobbery, Epstein writes, "Turns out
... there were more varieties of balsamic vinegar than American
states, possibly more virgin olive oils than actual virgins." Well,
here are more well-documented snobberies than there are oils and
vinegars combined.</TE>
<TE>   Nor are they limited to America. Even though the book concentrates
on the American scene, it is international in scope and global in
erudition. It is a tasty cake made mouthwatering by an array of
raisins: pertinent or delightfully impertinent quotations culled from
world literature, neither just American nor merely expectable, as
from, say, Proust and Balzac, Edith Wharton and Henry James. Many
come from unexpected but apt sources: Jules Renard and Giacomo
Leopardi, Georg Christoph Lichtenberg and George Santayana, Lord
Chesterfield and Lord Berners, the Duc de Saint-Simon and Martin and
Kingsley Amis. And those are just some literary ones; there are as
many from the social sciences, philosophy and journalism. One senses
that Epstein has read everything and either has a wizard memory or
has extracted quotations from lifelong voracious reading for this
all-encompassing compendium.</TE>
<TE>   And crammed it is, with so many goodies that it would require the
judgment of Solomon to determine what to quote and what, necessarily,
to omit. Just transcribing all the passages I have underlined in my
copy would yield a sizable brochure. Perhaps the best way to begin is
to list the types of snobbery that rate separate chapter headings. We
get "The Democratic Snob," "Snob-Jobbery," "O WASP, Where Is Thy
Sting-a-ling," "Class (All but) Dismissed" and "Such Good Taste."
Also snobberies based on status, wealth, showy education,
pseudo-intellectualism in academia, politics, sexuality and religion,
novelty, name-dropping, celebrity, "Anglo-, Franco-, and Other Odd
philias," food and drink and being with-it. And a good many lesser
others.</TE>
<TE>   Epstein is equally adept at incrimination and self-incrimination.
On his own snobbery: "On the Outer Drive in Chicago, I am behind a
car on whose back window is a decal reading 'Illinois State
University.' My view is that one oughtn't even to have a sticker that
reads 'All Souls, Oxford,' but Illinois State?" On other people's:
Gore Vidal "has made a career out of hard work in the service of
hauteur.... [He] doesn't court the love of critics or anyone else.
Self-love, which in him never goes unrequited, is sufficient." Again:
"People nowadays attempt to outdo one another not in the distinction
of their forebears but in the purity of their suffering--my holocaust
is greater than your slavery--establishing snobberies of virtue by
way of victimhood."</TE>
<TE>   And again: "It used to be who you were, then it was what you did,
then it was what you had, then it was whom you knew--and now it's
beginning to be how many people know you."</TE>
<TE>   Ours is the era of democratic middleman supremacy and middle-class
snobbery. "To be middle-class positions one nicely to be both an
upward- and a downward-looking snob, full, simultaneously, of
aspiration to rise to the position of those above and of disdain for
those below." "The agent, the broker, the trader, the marketer, the
investment banker, the all-purpose executive, the operator, the
entrepreneur, the man or woman who does not provide the service or
the product but helps bring it to market, usually acquiring a solid
profit for him- or herself along the way--these are the figures who
seem most admired ... just now." The person, in short, who neither
builds nor creates, just takes the cash and makes sure of getting
"the vice presidency, the best table, the fine wine, the excellent
opera tickets."</TE>
<TE>   The book is terrific on fashion snobbery. "Without a feeling of
exclusiveness--the snobbish element--fashion isn't successfully
fashionable.... The trick is somehow to find a place between being
fashionably stupid and stupidly unfashionable." It is similarly acute
on intellectual snobbery: "Among people ... who fancy themselves
intellectuals ... snobbery runs more rampant than bacteria through
the kitchen of a Tijuana slow-food restaurant." Epstein quotes Pierre
Bourdieu: "Nothing more clearly affirms one's 'class,' infallibly
classifies, than tastes in music." Or tastes in sports, "the range
running from hockey to polo."</TE>
<TE>   A special service Epstein offers is the debunking of snobbery's
idols. Thus, about Ralph Lauren, "who began with a line of men's
clothes that soon became what in the trade is known as lifestyle
design": His "career was built on the fantasies of a short Bronx-born
Jewish boy (ne Lifshitz) of how Wasps live, or at least ought to
live." Or consider: "Susan Sontag's message, though not always easily
made out, would appear to be one of (unearned) desolation.... The
only thing that appears to run really deep in her is her
humorlessness."</TE>
<TE>   He is affectionately pungent about Andy Warhol and distinguishes
between the snobberies of the name-dropping brothers Dunne, of whom
he prefers Dominick ("Truman Capote ... without the guile") to John
Gregory for being more open about it, having "stepped beyond and
above mere snobbery into very heaven." There is Norman Mailer,
"always behind his times ... still smarting under the old Wasp model
of snobbery"; also Robert Lowell, whose "poem 'My Last Afternoon With
Uncle Devereux Winslow' wouldn't ... carry quite the same glow with
the title 'My Last Afternoon With Uncle Sammy Shapiro.' " Again,
Walter Cronkite is "a high platitudinarian and a man with a face only
a nation could love."</TE>
<TE>   Epstein is right to remind us that "asserting one's superiority to
snobbery may be snobbishness too," that "no subject, apart possibly
from podiatry, is impermeable to snobbery," that, as La Rochefoucauld
said, "our virtues are, most often, only our vices disguised" and
that "anyone outside a Trappist monastery" will recognize at least
some of his own snobberies in this book.</TE>
<TE>   But he is no less right to warn against the "sour-grapes charge"
that equates "elitist" with "snob." "The elitist desires the best;
the snob wants other people to think he has, or is associated with,
the best. Delight in excellence is easily confused with snobbery by
the ignorant."</TE>
<TE>   If there is a blemish--no bigger than a pimple--on this marvelous
book, it is its intermittent sloppiness in matters of grammar,
syntax, vocabulary and style. So we get "although I don't go to
Paris, nor play golf," "congruent to," "the women who comprised the
heart of the set," "by we Anglophiles," "I had only to say this to
myself than to realize ... " and "the child is coddled, cozened,
cultivated as the precious piece of property" when even the correct
"cosseted" would have been redundant.</TE>
<TE>   Periodically, too, there is faulty parallelism, as in travel snobs
looking down on "that busload of thick-legged Germans; those gaggles
of Japanese, cameras slung round their necks; best of all for
deploring are one's easily detested fellow Americans," which last, to
be parallel, should read "best of all one's easily detested fellow
Americans." Epstein once wrote about me that I could find fault with
the text of a stop sign; I would say, "Stop sign, no; Epstein, yes."</TE>
<TE>   But all must be forgiven a man wise enough to write, "The
education and culture [most people] are presumably exposed to at
college never lay a glove on them ... [college being a place] where
they can spend four years learning that the glorious culture of fifth
century BC Athens was little more than a swindle built on a slave
society, that Shakespeare was a homosexual serving the interests of
imperialistic England and that women have gotten a raw deal
throughout history and up to twenty minutes ago." And much more that
is equally stingingly right.</TE>
<TE>   Epstein, however, is no crybaby. He is perfectly content with his
"modest fame but no celebrity" in a country where celebrity can be
acquired by murder, quiz-show money and under-the-desk sexual acts
performed with a high-level public servant and "serious fame" can be
achieved only in movies and on television.</TE>
<TE>   "Snobbery: The American Version" cannot, any more than anything
else can, put a stop to snobbery, but it may, by making us conscious
of its ridiculousness, help us control its worst excesses.
Ironically, though, it may create a new, albeit minor, form of
snobbery: pride in how many times you are mentioned, however
unfavorably (Bill Buckley and Donald Trump twice), in this most
treasurable of books.</TE>

<HD>To Be Young, Urban and Neurotic</HD>
<DH>The amusingly named troupe helps members cope with the
craziness of an actor's life</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The most prominent roles of Lauren Cohn's film career are in the can
now--her bank teller opposite Leonardo DiCaprio's sweet-talking
swindler in "Catch Me if You Can," and her woman in mourning consoled
by grief counselor George Clooney in the sci-fi feature "Solaris."</LD>
<LD>   But Cohn can't say for sure if she will be coming to a theater
near you. She could just as easily be headed for the outtakes pile.
Whether this brown-eyed bit player gets seen will be up to the
respective directors, Steven Spielberg and Steven Soderbergh. As for
Cohn, she is left to cope with the lack of autonomy, the uncertainty
of it all, as best she can.</LD>
<LD>   This common actor's lot has turned Cohn and a select group of her
similarly situated friends into Neurotic Young Urbanites. They know
what it means to feel isolated, marginal and at the mercy of other
people's whims as they try to crack the big world of Hollywood. But
during the past 10 years, this theater troupe, made up mainly of old
friends who went to acting school together at New York University,
has been able to find both community and control by creating little
worlds of its own onstage. The current Neurotic Young Urbanites
production is "Once Upon a Primetime," a musical spoof of TV culture
playing at the 75-seat Powerhouse Theatre in Santa Monica.</LD>
<TE>   At first, their intentions were purely mercenary. To survive in
Hollywood's feed pond, they needed agents. To acquire agents, they
needed to be seen. The solution: Rent a theater for a couple of
weekends, put on a program of one-act plays and hope to be noticed by
somebody.</TE>
<TE>   It worked. Co-founders Patrick Fischler and Paul Wittenburg, now
the company's artistic directors, both landed agents. Despite their
initially narrow aims, the two buddies realized they were onto
something worth doing for its own sake. Staging those short works by
John Guare, Jason Mulligan and James McClure had been fun. Why not do
it again?</TE>
<TE>   Now, after a decade of struggling to make their names in film and
television, the Neurotic Young Urbanites say the shows they do
together--they are on their 13th since that debut in December,
1992--are not a means to an end, but a vital end in themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's doing it for the right reasons now," the deep-voiced
Wittenburg says as he and five other members chat through a sunny
midday. They are seated around a green plastic table on the wooden
deck behind the Powerhouse. They titter at shared memories, make
wisecracks about one another's foibles, let loose spontaneous unison
choruses of laughter, and finish one another's sentences with
impunity. But Wittenburg is making this point in earnest, and nobody
interrupts. "This is our acting class, our grad school, our way of
staying sharp and focused and keeping ourselves sane."</TE>
<TE>   "You have so little control as a struggling actor, so any space
you can create where you have control is so necessary," adds Lauren
Bowles. The ponytailed blond baby-sat to make ends meet until last
year. Then a part she was born to play came through: the younger
sister on "Watching Ellie," an NBC sitcom starring Bowles' real-life
older sister, Julia Louis-Dreyfus of "Seinfeld" fame.</TE>
<TE>   The Neurotic Young Urbanites decided from the start to keep the
company small and among friends. Eight of the 10 members attended NYU
during the late 1980s and early '90s; by 1996 they all had moved to
L.A. The others are Derek Webster, a CalArts graduate who so
impressed the company at a 1994 audition that they invited him in,
and freelance director John Langs, the husband of Bowles' old friend,
actress Klea Scott. He became the Neurotics' resident director in
1999 when they were essaying their first and, to date, only classic,
"Twelfth Night," and decided they needed help from an experienced
Shakespearean.</TE>
<TE>   Members credit Langs with bringing a useful benevolent-outsider's
perspective to their all-in-the-family ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   "The great thing about us is the shorthand we have with each
other, but it's also the thing that could make us lazy," says
Michelle Azar, a Neurotic since 1993. Langs, she said, has helped
keep things fresh and pushed members to try new things.</TE>
<TE>   He also has encouraged the group's transformation during the past
three years into a self-contained factory for original work. Other
than "Twelfth Night," the Neurotics' first 10 productions were plays
by established contemporary writers, including Guare, A.R. Gurney,
Christopher Durang, Richard Dresser and David Ives. But since 2000,
they have bookended two deliberately silly original musicals, "Up the
Week Without a Paddle" and "Once Upon a Primetime," around a
jaundiced drama about Hollywood, "The Myth of More." Cohn and Bowles
have emerged as the group's writers; others in the ensemble are
credited with story ideas.</TE>
<TE>   Show business has been the plays' common theme. "Up the Week" and
"Primetime" handle it with insouciance--"Primetime" is a blithely
politically incorrect fable about a mistreated mute girl named Edna
Crumb who yearns to find her voice. She climbs through her television
screen to begin her quest, embarking on an "Alice in Wonderland"-like
journey through 1980s sitcoms and game shows that are ripe for
parody. "The Myth of More," staged last year, was a darkly satiric
look at what can come of the obsessive ambition and insecurity rife
in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Times reviewers have praised all three. "Up the Week" was called
"one of the sweetest theatrical trifles of the season." "The Myth of
More" was rated a "slickly produced package [with] a tarnished gloss
worthy of Tinseltown," and "Once Upon a Primetime" was notable for
its "endearing ensemble" in service of "a loopy spoof [that] is
deliciously twisted."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the shifts in form and tone from show to show, Langs sees
the troupe developing a coherent body of work.</TE>
<TE>   "We live in a TV world, and these guys are constantly out
auditioning for movies and television. To bring back their experience
into the theater and be able to really skewer it and comment on it
and revel in it is something that really marks what we do. And it
fulfills what the name Neurotic Young Urbanites puts out there--this
sense of trying to understand yourself in a crazy place."</TE>
<TE>   The company prides itself on special staging effects, such as the
interweaving of video with live action in "The Myth of More," and the
giant hollowed-out TV set that levitates and descends as needed in
"Once Upon a Primetime." Budgets tend to range from $15,000 to
$20,000 a show, says Wittenburg--on the high side for small-theater
productions. That's one reason the nonprofit troupe plans just one
show a year, occasionally working in a second.</TE>
<TE>   Ties to other community institutions have helped, members say. An
early hangout was Patrick's Roadhouse, a beachfront restaurant in
Santa Monca that Fischler's family has owned for 29 years; in fact,
the place was named after him, the youngest of four kids. Fischler
says his sister, who runs the restaurant, comes to Neurotics shows
every weekend and brings a sizable contingent.</TE>
<TE>   Azar's husband, Jonathan Aaron, is an associate rabbi at Temple
Emmanuel in Beverly Hills. For years, the synagogue has provided free
rehearsal space.</TE>
<TE>   Among the issues that the troupe will have to sort out as they
move into their second decade are whether to seek an ongoing
residency at a single theater rather than moving from space to space,
and whether to try to step up the number of productions--which would
mean raising more money.</TE>
<TE>   Other ideas include writing an original play in rhymed couplets,
performing the troupe's two original musicals together in repertory,
and taking a break from new work to mount an established play. The
decisions are ultimately up to Fischler and Wittenburg.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not really a democracy here. It's a happy dictatorship,"
says Fischler, who has had the most active screen career among the
Neurotics. He had a monologue as a man with nightmarish visions in
David Lynch's "Mulholland Drive" and played the recurring role of
Pepe, a streetwise character, on the cop series "Nash Bridges." Cohn
says she once got into an elevator with Fischler while celebrating
his birthday in Las Vegas. "A woman went 'It's Pepe!' like he was
Elvis or something."</TE>
<TE>   The company's name won't change, Fischler vows, even though
Wittenburg gripes wryly that "in three years, it will be kitsch and
depressing" if these Neurotic Urbanites still bill themselves as
"Young."</TE>
<TE>   Even more depressing, though, Wittenburg says, would be the
anxiety-provoking uncertainties and frequent rejections of the
actor's life, unrelieved by the tonic that comes from being a
Neurotic.</TE>
<TE>   "You have the whole rest of your career to be poor and not
noticed, so you might as well have fun for the hour and a half you
have onstage."</TE>

<HD>An Actor's Dream and Dread</HD>
<DH>When Brad Oscar vaulted from supporting player to a star of
'The Producers,' nothing less than the show's survival was at stake</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It's exhausting to be the king.</LD>
<LD>   Minutes after the curtain falls on "The Producers," with cheers
still ringing in his ears, Brad Oscar hustles up the stairs to his
second-floor dressing room in the St. James Theatre and tries to
catch his breath.</LD>
<LD>   He's drenched in sweat. He's yawning every two minutes. As the
clock inches past 11:30 on a steamy night, his friendly blue eyes
have the slightly dazed look of a man who has won the war but taken a
beating.</LD>
<TE>   "This was a good crowd," says the 37-year-old actor playing Max
Bialystock, the so-called King of Broadway, in Mel Brooks' hit show.
"Not raucous but noisy. On a night like this, I don't have to work so
hard."</TE>
<TE>   Please. In one of the most taxing roles ever written for a
Broadway musical, Oscar is on stage for nearly all of the three-hour
show. He sings and dances, struts, bellows, shouts and booms his way
through a part that physically drains him each time he takes the
stage. Eight times a week.</TE>
<TE>   Working at a manic pace has become the defining reality of Oscar's
life since he was handed the plum role of Bialystock in April. And it
remains a hallmark of the show that still hums with relentless energy
and comedic flair 15 months after opening night. As "The Producers"
cruises into a second boffo year, the show is preparing to launch the
first of two national tours, including a special Los Angeles
engagement with two marquee names set to begin in April 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Oscar's meteoric rise in the New York company, from an obscure
understudy to the juiciest role on Broadway, has become the stuff of
legend and a key ingredient of the show's success. But his unexpected
celebrity has also had a downside. He had to live up to extraordinary
expectations in taking over a high-profile part made famous by Nathan
Lane, his Tony Award-winning predecessor, and earlier by Zero Mostel
in a beloved 1968 movie. More important, he inherited the role at a
moment when "The Producers" was hit by critical and financial
turbulence, and its future as a musical that might run for years was
in doubt. Initially passed over when it came time to replace Lane,
Oscar vaulted back into the spotlight when the first replacement,
British stage star Henry Goodman, was fired after only four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The story of how Oscar's performance stabilized the show and
helped put it back on course offers a fascinating glimpse of the
creative and financial forces driving one of Broadway's most
successful productions. It also shows how a modest, even-tempered
actor like Oscar--something of a rarity on the Great White
Way--managed to survive a backstage pressure cooker and thrive in a
world where watching your back is no less important than watching
your cues.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some were openly skeptical when he took over as
Bialystock, seeing dark clouds over the St. James Theatre: Could the
show overcome the much-ballyhooed departures of Lane and Matthew
Broderick, a duo that was the top box office draw for Broadway's
biggest hit? Could the musical keep making buckets of money? And
could Oscar, who looked and sounded like Lane, ever make the part his
own?</TE>
<TE>   As new cast members settle into the show--including TV star Steven
Weber, who has replaced Broderick as nerdy accountant Leo Bloom--the
audiences who rise to cheer each night have answered all of these
questions. Oscar has blossomed in the part, and tickets remain scarce
for the tale of Max Bialystock, a schlockmeister producer who bilks
millions from little old lady investors by staging "Springtime for
Hitler," a show intended to be a Broadway flop.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to see an actor like Brad grab a role and put his own
stamp on a character," said Susan Stroman, who won Tony awards for
the show's direction and choreography. "You don't always see this
kind of evolution on Broadway. Brad's really cruising now. He's got
it down."</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't always so easy.</TE>
<TE>   On the night of April 16, Oscar stood on stage for the first time
as Max Bialystock, instead of as Lane's understudy. Although he had
played the role 72 times before, filling in after the star developed
nodules on his vocal cords, the producers of a Broadway show that had
been raking in millions--and won a record 12 Tony awards--were as
nervous as their new leading man.</TE>
<TE>   Less than 48 hours earlier, they had fired Goodman, an almost
unheard-of move that sparked an overnight media furor. The actor
simply didn't click in the role, insiders said, and audiences weren't
laughing. The show paid off the $480,000 remaining on Goodman's
contract through the end of the year and sent him packing.</TE>
<TE>   "Oy," says Oscar, recalling the tumult.</TE>
<TE>   In two weeks, critics would come to review the new cast, and if
they were savage, "The Producers" might have gone from being
untouchable to just another run-of-the-mill phenomenon, New York Post
drama columnist Michael Riedel said. "They could have taken a major
financial hit--at least in the long term."</TE>
<TE>   As the curtain rose on that performance, the cast was in turmoil,
roiled by Goodman's hiring and firing. Weber, who was struggling to
fill Broderick's shoes, had spent 10 weeks honing a performance with
Goodman, and now he had to learn new chemistry with a new star.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, some observers were blasting the decision by the show's
producers to continue charging $480 each for a select number of
tickets, to compete with scalpers. How could they justify such
inflated prices to see a new, untested set of actors?</TE>
<TE>   "There was tension," said Oscar, recalling the backstage mood.
"And during the opening moment something strange happened. In the
script I say, 'How dare they insult me in this manner? I am Max
Bialystock!'</TE>
<TE>   "And, you know, it was like an out-of-body experience. I heard
those words, and I thought, My God, I am Max Bialystock. What a
story!"</TE>
<TE>   How did it begin? With a call on Oscar's cell phone, like every
other twist and turn in his life with the show.</TE>
<TE>   When he was first cast in November 2000 as a swing--an understudy
ready to perform up to seven different roles in the musical--Oscar
says he got the news on a phone call as he was entering an airplane
restroom ("my private office") on a St. Louis runway. When he was
cast three months later as Franz Liebkind, the lunatic Nazi
playwright who pens "Springtime for Hitler," his cell phone rang
again, this time in a noisy New York airport.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest call came on the evening of April 14, when Oscar
attended the opening-night party for "The Elephant Man" at Tavern on
the Green in Central Park. He knew something was up when he heard
Stroman's voice on the other end. It was almost 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you talk now?" she asked urgently, telling him to put down
his cheese plate and find a quiet place in the restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the bombshell: Goodman had just been fired, and the
producers wanted Oscar to replace him immediately. The role was his.
Would he do it?</TE>
<TE>   "I told her I'd think about it," he deadpanned, recalling the
moment. Then he switched into a mock serious tone, echoing one of the
show's funniest lines: "This decision could very well affect the rest
of my career. I shall have to think about it. I'll do it!"</TE>
<TE>   There was no shortage of gratitude on the other end. "Thank you
for saving 'The Producers' twice," Stroman said, referring first to
his assumption of the Liebkind part--which he inherited when the
original actor injured his knee--and now the biggest role of all.</TE>
<TE>   "Hello dahling," said Anne Bancroft, when Oscar returned Mel
Brooks' congratulatory call minutes later. Brooks couldn't come to
the phone at that moment, his wife explained delicately, because he
was talking with Goodman.</TE>
<TE>   "Oy," said Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   He was thunderstruck. But smart enough to know that Stroman's
offer also reflected the turmoil enveloping the show. The buzz on the
street was that Goodman and Weber were having difficulty settling
into their roles. Backstage, the verdict was more blunt: With Goodman
leading the cast, some feared, "The Producers" might be in artistic
and financial jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're talking about a show with the long-term franchise
prospects of 'The Producers,' all casting decisions are critical, and
none more so than the very first major cast changes," said Jed
Bernstein, president of the League of American Theatres and
Producers. "What you do with that first change sets the tone for all
future changes and sends a message to your audience.</TE>
<TE>   "For 'The Producers,' " he added, "the issue is not whether it's
going to be hard to get a ticket now, in 2002, but whether it's hard
in the summer of 2008."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Goodman's bona fide credentials, producers insisted when
they cast him that the show was the real star. Audiences would still
be entertained, they predicted, so it wasn't necessary to bring in
more celebrities like Lane and Broderick. Yet Goodman seemed awkward
from the start. He took a dark, method actor's approach, dampening
Brooks' wacky satire. Where Lane was larger than life, Goodman played
the role like a wizened Jimmy Durante.</TE>
<TE>   "The St. James Theatre went from being a place where I looked
forward to going to work, to a place that was depressing, a place
where I said, 'Oh, my God, I've got to go to work again,' " said Gary
Beach, the dazzling Tony-winning actor who plays Roger Debris, a
flamboyant gay director. "Suddenly, there was a sadness surrounding
the show. And there was a feeling that it might not be the same
again--that we had lost it."</TE>
<TE>   Even today, some cast members seem to be in mourning for the good
old days on West 44th Street, when Lane and Broderick got nightly
ovations.</TE>
<TE>   "I still see Nathan and Matthew, and Nathan told me the other
night, 'I miss being together,' " said Cady Huffman, the Tony
Award-winning actress who plays Swedish sex-bomb secretary Ulla. "It
was such a special time, and we all know that it won't happen again
in our lives."</TE>
<TE>   But investors' financial expectations had not changed. The show,
which cost $10.5 million to produce, made back its initial outlay in
less than nine months. When the St. James is sold out, as on most
nights, the musical typically grosses $1.1 million in a week--more
than any other show on Broadway. The idea that such a well might
suddenly run dry was unthinkable to corporate backers.</TE>
<TE>   This was the bubbling caldron Oscar stepped into when he took over
the role. Critics were coming soon, and there was barely enough time
for him and Weber to invent and polish their own stage chemistry.
Cast members were "freaking tired," Huffman said, and Stroman called
for a marathon rehearsal the next day. The hard work of keeping the
magic alive began.</TE>
<TE>   Almost any other show might have cracked under the pressure. But
"The Producers" was blessed with a deep supporting cast that
contributes as much, if not more, to the production as the two main
stars. Beach, Huffman and Roger Bart, who plays Carmen Ghia, Debris'
"common-law assistant," performed crucial featured roles. And
standing behind them was a richly talented ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the key difference between the movie and the Broadway
version of 'The Producers,' " Huffman said. "In the movie, there are
other characters who are basically peripheral. But in the live show,
they are vital to the story. They play a central role and the
audience picks up on this."</TE>
<TE>   "The Producers' " extraordinary depth was on display April 16 when
a new Bialystock took command. And so was its emotional life. Oscar
received rousing applause and the cast was relieved.</TE>
<TE>   "Brad stepped into the role of Max Bialystock at a time when all
of us were under immense pressure to show that we still had the magic
in us," recalls Jeffrey Denman, a former supporting cast member and
the author of "A Year With 'The Producers.' " "His performance helped
us regain what we had."</TE>
<TE>   Others knocked wood, saying the show had dodged a bullet.</TE>
<TE>   "The Henry Goodman experience scared" the producers, Weber said.
"It showed them that this unsinkable show wasn't so immune after all.
They knew that they had to find a way to keep the show attractive and
also make tons of money. They realized that we could be hurt if they
didn't do the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   Audiences typically rise to their feet and cheer as the production
ends, whether they've been a rambunctious crowd or a sleepy bunch.
Either way, says Beach, the verdict should be that this show is
better than the hype.</TE>
<TE>   "It was crucial that, after all the dust settled, the reviews
would say the show is still great," he said. "That's what we had to
get out there. And it's not as easy as you might think, because 'The
Producers' take an amazing amount of energy to perform well eight
times a week."</TE>
<TE>   As curtain time approaches for a Wednesday matinee, the theater
ripples with tension.</TE>
<TE>   "Five minutes! Five minutes!" crackles the backstage intercom in
Oscar's worn but clean dressing room. The King of Broadway puts on
his pants one leg at time, adjusts two body microphones, and finishes
off a cheese-stuffed bagel, heading downstairs for the opening scene.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm on the Max Bialystock diet," he cracks, adjusting his tie and
fedora. "No workouts. Just endurance."</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, he's on stage, kicking off a 30-minute run that
begins with the show's first extended song. As the audience applauds,
he rushes off stage right for the next scene, burying himself under a
pile of newspapers on a couch in his producer's office, getting ready
to meet Leo Bloom.</TE>
<TE>   The two spar verbally, then Oscar charges into a mock-seduction
scene opposite a hyper-sexed little old lady. When she dashes off
stage, he turns once again to Bloom, pleading with him to help
produce a deliberate flop. The stint ends with "We Can Do It," an
energetic number in which he climbs over a sofa, chases Bloom and
dances with him.</TE>
<TE>   As Oscar finally exits, breathing heavily, massive new scenery is
rolling into place backstage. The producer's suite has become an
accounting office and cast members are racing into place. There is
little room for anyone in the wings, except for chorus girls who are
sprinting upstairs from a dressing room under the stage and tearing
around corners, waiting to go on. Calibrated to a split-second, the
choreography behind the scenes is more complex than the dance numbers
on stage.</TE>
<TE>   "Look out Broadway, here I come!" echoes the last line of "I Wanna
Be a Producer," and Oscar is set to go back on stage again--this time
for the entire 50 minutes remaining in the first act. He's had seven
minutes to rest.</TE>
<TE>   By now the cast has been carefully reading the audience, and the
verdict is in on today's show: "Oh, honey--they're old!" ensemble
member Kathy Fitzgerald grumbles to Oscar, as she hurries off stage.
"They're on heart and lung machines!"</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, Beach and his sidekick, Bart, bring down the house
as a tres-gay theatrical couple. Laughter fills the theater and the
crowd seems to get noisier.</TE>
<TE>   When Bialystock asks Beach's character if he will direct
Liebkind's ridiculous play, the pompous thespian says he finds the
work fascinating, adding: "I, for one, never realized that the Third
Reich meant Germany."</TE>
<TE>   Some crowds roar at the line, as they do this afternoon. But,
Beach notes, "there are nights when I say this, and half the audience
is nodding in agreement. They didn't know this either. Not to be
insulting, but every show is different."</TE>
<TE>   The pace is relentless and early in the second act Oscar does
something unusual. While Huffman and Weber sing "That Face," a love
duet, the actor sneaks down a flight of stairs off stage left, turns
into a narrow hallway and opens a door that puts him onto West 44th
Street for a breath of fresh air.</TE>
<TE>   Crowds fill the sidewalk and a bus full of senior citizens is
emptying in front of the St. James Theatre. "Who is that?" yells one
woman, pointing at Oscar, in full costume, in the doorway. He quickly
ducks inside, and the second act pulls him back in.</TE>
<TE>   Less than 15 minutes later, "The Producers" hits a peak with the
show-stopping "Springtime for Hitler." It's a comic masterpiece, a
jaw-dropping sendup of Broadway anthems that allows the audience to
experience firsthand the show's delicious twist: While a song
celebrating Hitler's rise to power may be crude and tasteless, 1,700
people give it an ovation.</TE>
<TE>   As dancing "hotsy-totsy" Nazis enter from stage right and left,
Beach--now playing a gay Adolf Hitler--soars from a lift and sings
"Heil myself, heil to me. I'm the Kraut who's out to change our
history."</TE>
<TE>   Backstage, ensemble members are hurriedly tearing off costumes,
putting on new outfits, reassembling in the wings and rushing back
on. Like other cast members, Huffman huffs through several costume
changes in seven frenetic minutes, first appearing as a Third Reich
chorus girl, then as a tap-dancing Bavarian peasant and finally as a
sequined Marlene Dietrich, high-kicking her way across the stage as
bombs explode in the background.</TE>
<TE>   Some three hours after it began, the matinee ends and cast members
scatter to their dressing rooms. The whole show will begin again at 8
p.m. "Halftime!" shouts one singer, dashing out for a bite to eat.
"One more!"</TE>
<TE>   Good luck, good luck, good luck.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and family shower Oscar with good wishes and flowers as
curtain time nears on May 1. He's played Bialystock many times, he
tells himself, so there is no reason to be nervous. But tonight is
different. The critics are coming.</TE>
<TE>   "The reviews come out a lot faster when the critics leave at
intermission," he cracks in the show's opening number, and people
laugh. That's a good sign, Oscar thinks to himself, an early
barometer of how the musical is playing.</TE>
<TE>   More and bigger laughs greet Beach and Bart as they sing "Keep It
Gay," and the first act ends to tumultuous cheers. By the time Oscar
finishes "Betrayed," a bravura second-act number in which Bialystock
recapitulates the entire show, he seems to own the Wednesday-night
audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Brad showed what he was made up of on that second opening night,"
Stroman says. "He's a consummate professional, and we were all
pleased."</TE>
<TE>   So were most of the critics.</TE>
<TE>   All said the show remained a blockbuster. Howard Kissel, in the
New York Daily News, wrote that Oscar "has a better voice and more
musicality than [Lane].... He has become more confident and
expansive. His shining bald head and often popping eyes give him the
look of an apoplectic walrus, which adds to the comedy of the part."</TE>
<TE>   The New York Post's Clive Barnes called Oscar "superb," and
Newsday's Linda Winer praised him as "a major talent with a lovely,
comfortable sense of absurdity. He finds more subtle notes in the
character than Lane did."</TE>
<TE>   But some couldn't shake Lane's ghost. The New York Times' Ben
Brantley said Oscar had yet to find himself in the role, adding that
he "is doing his level best to channel Mr. Lane's Tony-winning
performance. The Lane-style grimaces, the exasperated line readings,
the flamboyant gestures are often rendered with conscientious
exactitude."</TE>
<TE>   Baloney, thought other cast members. Denman said the role of
Bialystock is one of the more difficult to play in the Broadway
canon, and only a few actors--including Oscar--have the inner
discipline to play it well. "It doesn't matter if you think he's
doing a Lane impersonation," he said. "It's what he brings to the
role that is relevant."</TE>
<TE>   Others suggested "The Producers' " new star was following an
honorable Broadway tradition of replacing the supposedly
unreplaceable star. On "Theatre Talk," a local television show, host
Susan Haskins mused that the musical needed to forget Nathan Lane and
find its own Herschel Bernardi.</TE>
<TE>   Back in 1966, after Mostel left the original production of
"Fiddler on the Roof," producers replaced him with Bernardi, and the
hit show kept rolling. Not all casting changes work so well. When
Julie Andrews had to leave "Victor/Victoria" on Broadway for health
reasons, she was replaced by Raquel Welch. The buzz was bad, a chill
set in at the box office, and the show soon folded.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Oscar has tinkered with dialogue and shtick that
worked for Lane but not for him. Some changes simply reflect the fact
that the show biz-savvy crowds who flocked to "The Producers" when it
opened have been replaced by "normal" customers who might not get
Brooks' inside jokes.</TE>
<TE>   There is a moment, for example, when Bialystock tells a clueless
Bloom the two cardinal rules of being a producer. Rule No. 1, Lane
would say calmly, "Never put your own money in the show." Rule No. 2,
he'd say, screaming into Broderick's ear--and summoning the ghost of
Jackie Gleason--is "never put your own money in the show."</TE>
<TE>   Oscar tried that, but audiences didn't get the humor. He retired
the gag, simply repeating the line twice and getting bigger laughs.</TE>
<TE>   No longer limited by an understudy's deference to the star, he's
playing with the role and experimenting nightly. Oscar is clearly
more comfortable now, performing Bialystock with a comic ferocity
that recalls Mostel, and he has no lack of guidance from the show's
creators. After one matinee, he canceled his dinner plans with a
reporter when Brooks asked to speak with his new star that evening.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to see Brad!" boomed the comic legend, wearing a blue
sport jacket and tie and climbing the stairs, jaunty jolly, to
Oscar's dressing room. Once inside, he delivered "notes," critiquing
the just-concluded performance. The message that afternoon was clear:
Oscar should relax more and not try to land laughs so hard. He didn't
need to have heart attacks on stage to communicate that a big laugh
was coming.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you going to do, argue with Mel?" shrugged Oscar,
recalling the meeting. "He's always been right on the money. He knows
what works."</TE>
<TE>   In the ensuing weeks, Brooks and Stroman would visit Oscar's
dressing room several times. They'd also offer suggestions to Weber.
The show, finally, seemed to be out of the woods.</TE>
<TE>   Still, its long-term financial future is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, "The Producers" remains golden. A national touring
company will open in Pittsburgh on Sept. 10, and when it reaches the
Pantages Theatre in April 2003, Jason Alexander will join the cast as
Bialystock for a special Los Angeles engagement. Producers have
offered the role of Bloom to Martin Short. During that same month, a
second national company will open in Boston, and the two companies
will tour the heartland.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a show that will have a very powerful attraction for
people in Southern California," said Gordon Davidson, artistic
director of the Ahmanson Theatre, which is offering the show as part
of its subscription season.</TE>
<TE>   "They're looking at a six-month engagement," he adds. "And if
they're flexible, they could be pleasantly surprised and extend it
even more."</TE>
<TE>   It'll run for 20 years, boosters say. But like any other show,
"The Producers' " New York run will be extended incrementally, in
six-month blocks of ticket sales. So far, the show has a fat advance
sale through December, but it remains to be seen if this box office
power will carry over into the New Year, which has traditionally been
Broadway's slowest season.</TE>
<TE>   Oscar and Weber are signed through Dec. 31, and then the producers
may decide to recruit a pair of new stars.</TE>
<TE>   Will the new actors, too, keep customers satisfied?</TE>
<TE>   "That's the big question," said Ken Brown, who is Oscar's dresser
and a savvy veteran of many shows. "We don't know what long-run sales
will be as the show changes. Until you know, you can't be sure."</TE>
<TE>   The only certainty is that "The Producers" will keep people
laughing on West 44th Street through the fall--and Oscar will still
be pinching himself each night on stage. To make sure it's all real.</TE>
<TE>   "I still get goose bumps being up there," he says, packing his
gear after the show and yawning once more. "Part of me still can't
believe this happened. But the other part says: 'It happened. Now get
some rest.' "</TE>

<LD>Since leaving the hottest show on Broadway in March, Nathan Lane and
Matthew Broderick have gotten some rest and are now embarking on a
series of new projects.</LD>
<LD>   Lane, who won a Tony for his portrayal of scheming producer Max
Bialystock, has been filming "Life of the Party," a potential CBS
sitcom about an ex-TV star who is elected to Congress and happens to
be gay. He has also filmed "Nicholas Nickleby" in England and is
working on a movie about the life of Jackie Gleason.</LD>
<LD>   Broderick, who received a Tony nomination for his portrayal of
accountant Leo Bloom, has filmed an ABC television version of "The
Music Man," starring as con-man Professor Harold Hill opposite
Kristin Chenoweth.</LD>
<TE>   On the day they left "The Producers," Tony-winning
director-choreographer Susan Stroman stood on stage as the two men
took their final bows and publicly invited them to rejoin the show at
some future date. This may now be a distinct possibility, according
to Mel Brooks, who co-wrote the show with Tom Meehan. In a recent
interview with Variety's Army Archerd, Brooks said Lane and Broderick
would reunite for a six-month London run, either late next year or in
early 2004.</TE>

<DH>In a new album colored by 9/11, Bruce Springsteen
powerfully fights the darkness of the soul</DH>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>From the bridge near his house in Monmouth County, N.J., Bruce
Springsteen could see the twin towers of the World Trade Center on
clear days. His sharpest memory now of Sept. 11 is driving across
that bridge and seeing an empty sky.</LD>
<LD>   "I must have seen those towers a thousand times from the bridge,"
Springsteen says, sitting in a Manhattan recording studio about a
dozen subway stops from ground zero.</LD>
<LD>   "I spent most of Sept. 11 in front of the television like
everybody else, watching those pictures of the towers collapsing over
and over, but it all didn't really hit home until I took a ride
across the bridge and there was nothing where the towers used to be.
The real world, I guess, is always more dramatic than something on
television."</LD>
<TE>   Almost immediately, Springsteen began writing a salute to the
hundreds of rescue workers who rushed into the skyscrapers the
morning of the terrorist attacks. He planned to sing the song, "Into
the Fire," on the nationally televised Sept. 21 telethon, but he
didn't finish it in time. He substituted "My City of Ruins," an older
song about the life being sucked out of Asbury Park, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   With its uplifting call to "rise up" from despair, "City" worked
well in the solemn context of the telethon. Yet Springsteen remained
so haunted by Sept. 11 that he not only finished "Into the Fire," but
also began writing other songs, including "You're Missing" and "Empty
Sky," that expressed the delicate emotions he felt in the days and
weeks after the tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   Those tunes form the heart of "The Rising," which will be released
July 30 by Columbia Records. It's Springsteen's first studio album
with the E Street Band since 1984's "Born in the U.S.A.," and it will
be followed this summer by an extensive U.S. and European tour with
the band. The tour begins Aug. 7 in East Rutherford. N.J., and
includes a stop Aug. 24 at the Forum in Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   In both its length (73 minutes) and its variety of emotional
tones, "The Rising" feels closest to "The River" among Springsteen's
previous works. There are moments, however, as stark and disheartened
as "Nebraska," and others as rich and joyful as "Rosalita."</TE>
<TE>   On a more contemporary scale, "The Rising" is reminiscent of U2's
"All That You Can't Leave Behind." Both albums are conscious steps by
major artists to reconnect with their classic sounds.</TE>
<TE>   After a series of albums with other musicians and ones that
focused on Springsteen's transition to adulthood, "The Rising" looks
at the outside world and tries to make sense of it all.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most moving songs, "Empty Sky," conveys the heartache
of losing a loved one. The imagery seems drawn from that post-Sept.
11 view from the bridge:</TE>
<TE>   I woke up this morning</TE>
<TE>   I could barely breathe</TE>
<TE>   Just an empty impression</TE>
<TE>   In the bed where you used to be.</TE>
<TE>   I want a kiss from your lips</TE>
<TE>   I want an eye for an eye</TE>
<TE>   I woke up this morning to an empty sky.</TE>
<TE>   "The atmosphere in the days after Sept. 11 felt like it must have
during wartime--the uncertainty and the anxiety and the concern,"
Springsteen says. "I don't think anyone will ever forget it,
particularly here in New Jersey. The local communities were hit
pretty hard. There were 150-plus casualties from Monmouth County
alone. You would drive by the church every day and there was another
funeral."</TE>
<TE>   For those who listened in the '70s and early '80s to Springsteen's
dark, desperate tales of isolation and the search for a sense of
family and comfort, it's touching to see him in the corner of the
Manhattan studio with the oldest of his three children.</TE>
<TE>   Springsteen, who was 14 when he began his rock 'n' roll journey,
is describing recording equipment to Evan, 11, the same way a T-ball
father might explain how to grip a baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a recording setup at home, but it's not a 'studio'
studio," Springsteen, 52, says, after introducing Evan and two
cousins to a visitor. "It's movable equipment so one day it might be
in the living room, then some other room.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so familiar to the kids that it's just like another piece of
furniture. It's a lot more exotic to them in a place like this that
is built for recording."</TE>
<TE>   It's much different interviewing Springsteen now than in the '70s
and '80s, when you wondered if he was ever going to find relief from
the feelings of isolation and uncertainty that shadowed him.</TE>
<TE>   I used to think he didn't talk about his personal life because he
wanted it to be private But it became clear that he had no personal
life in the traditional sense. There were girlfriends at various
points and certainly joy over the way his music was being received,
but his sights were always set on the next song, the next concert,
the next album. That's where he seemed to find self-affirmation and
comfort. .</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until marriage to his band member Patti Scialfa and the
birth of their first son that he felt the love and generosity of
spirit he had long sought.</TE>
<TE>   Today, he's much more relaxed, talking about his family as well as
his music. In the liner notes for the new album, Springsteen thanks
Scialfa for "making it all possible."</TE>
<TE>   Although he still has a house in Los Angeles, Springsteen now
lives most of the year with his wife and their children (Evan,
Jessica, 10, and Sam, 8) near his native Freehold, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   "I love California," he says, wearing a sweatshirt and jeans. "I
loved writing about it. Some part of me still feels very connected to
California, but we have a big family at home. I grew up around many,
many aunts and cousins. We had a street where we had six houses on
it, my family did.</TE>
<TE>   "So I wanted my kids to have the same opportunity. I have a lot of
great memories of having a big family and the different kinds of
characters of who were in it, the different kinds of things we did. I
have the luxury of being able to give that to my kids because my job
is movable." He laughs.</TE>
<TE>   Springsteen takes the role of local citizen seriously, frequently
performing at benefit concerts in the area. Rather than join Paul
McCartney, the Rolling Stones and others in "The Concert for New York
City" on Oct. 20 at Madison Square Garden, he joined some local
musicians for two nights the same week at the 1,400-seat Count Basie
Theatre in Red Bank, N.J. The shows raised $1 million for families of
World Trade Center attack victims from Monmouth County.</TE>
<TE>   This sense of family and community runs through much of "The
Rising," whose overriding feeling is about rallying back after the
loss of someone close to you.</TE>
<TE>   Springsteen has touched on the theme before. In "Souls of the
Departed" on 1992's "Lucky Town," he wrote about a 7-year-old boy who
was killed in gang shootout. Reflecting a parent's protective fear,
he sang, "I want to build a wall so high that nothing can burn it
down."</TE>
<TE>   The events of Sept. 11 demonstrated that no wall is high enough to
guarantee safety. There is a sense we've all entered a different
world--and there is a prayer-like, spiritual underpinning to several
of the songs. In "Worlds Apart," Springsteen sings, "May the living
let us in, before the dead tear us apart."</TE>
<TE>   Ten months after the tragedy of Sept. 11, people still stand five
and six deep along Liberty Street here to look through a fence at the
remains of the World Trade Center. The most striking thing is the
size of the gaping hole--so much larger than any TV screen could
convey. You see reminders of Sept. 11 throughout the city. At the
boarded-up fire station across the street from the tower site,
hundreds of rescue workers from around the country have left uniform
patches on a wall, in tribute and solidarity.</TE>
<TE>   Given the trauma of Sept. 11, it's surprising how silent pop music
has been on the subject. Maybe other musicians have been intimidated
by the challenge. Shortly after Sept. 11, the Onion, the satirical
publication, published a fictional story about President Bush urging
singers to resist recording one of those mawkish charity ballads. "To
America's recording artists," Bush pleads, "I just want to say,
please, there has already been enough suffering."</TE>
<TE>   Springsteen laughs when told about the Onion story. "I didn't set
out to write a 9/11 album," he says. "I didn't want to write
literally about what happened, but the emotions in the air. In the
purest sense, that's what a songwriter does."</TE>
<TE>   Reinvigorated after a 1999-2000 reunion tour with the E Streeters,
the singer looked forward to making an album with the band. Wanting
"fresh ears" in the studio after years of co-producing his albums
with a team that included his manager, Jon Landau, and producer Chuck
Plotkin, Springsteen hired Brendan O'Brien, a rock producer whose
credits include albums by Pearl Jam.</TE>
<TE>   Preparing for the album, Springsteen played O'Brien demo tapes of
songs written in recent years with the E Street Band in
mind--including "Nothing Man," which O'Brien particularly liked.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most powerful tracks on "The Rising," it tells of a man
so shaken by a life-threatening moment that he becomes nearly
suicidal. He's troubled by being described in his local paper as a
hero when he was just doing his job. In the chilling final lines,
he's sitting on the bed, "the pearl and silver" gun resting on his
night table.</TE>
<TE>   It sounds like stories we've heard about some of the firefighters
who came away from Sept. 11 feeling unworthy of the cheers, and
perhaps a little guilty that they were still alive when some of their
co-workers were killed while trying to rescue victims from the
towers.</TE>
<TE>   But Springsteen says the song, which was written shortly after
"Streets of Philadelphia" in 1994, is about the self-doubts and
confusion anyone, including a soldier, might feel after going through
a cataclysmic event.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to "My City of Ruins" and "Nothing Man," the upbeat,
sing-along "Waitin' on a Sunny Day" and the spiritually tinged
"Further on up the Road" were also written before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the album's 15 songs, however, were shaped in some form by
the events of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Like most albums that break the 50-minute barrier, from Bob
Dylan's Grammy-winning "Time Out of Mind" to Eminem's "The Eminem
Show," "The Rising" feels bloated in places. It would have been more
consistent if a couple of the upbeat tracks, especially the generic
soul exercise "Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin)," had been omitted.</TE>
<TE>   The heart of "The Rising," however, ranks with Springsteen's most
moving work. The moods range from the somberness of "Nothing Man" and
"Empty Sky" to the party-time zest of "Mary's Place."</TE>
<TE>   The latter is a warm tribute to the therapeutic powers of rock 'n'
roll, with Springsteen reverting to his youth in the lyrics as he
talks about dropping a needle on a vinyl record rather than pushing
the "play" button on a CD player. As if trying to exceed even the
trademark energy of "Rosalita," one of his most enduring concert
numbers, Springsteen and producer O'Brien supplement the seven-piece
E Street Band with backup singers, cello, violin and a five-piece
horn section. The result is a glorious avalanche of sound. "Into the
Fire" and the album's title track are both inspirational looks at
living up to one's responsibilities--even in the face of
life-threatening danger.</TE>
<TE>   Springsteen needs the resilience and optimism of such tunes as
"Mary's Place," "Waitin' on a Sunny Day" and "The Rising" to offset
some of the darkness in the album. The team also expands the E Street
Band in other places, bringing in some R&amp;B vocalists on "Let's Be
Friends (Skin to Skin)" and Pakistani musicians led by Asif Ali Khan
to accent musically the cultural differences outlined in "Worlds
Apart."</TE>
<TE>   The album's most compelling track, "Paradise," is a gripping
personal testimony, and it's fitting that Springsteen returns to the
solo, acoustic mode of "Nebraska."</TE>
<TE>   In the song, Springsteen looks at life and death from various
vantage points--from the suicide bombers in the opening verse to the
wife of a terrorist's victim in the second. The final verse tells of
someone so shattered by the death of a loved one that he looks
forward to the comfort of drowning. In the final lines, however, he
chooses life: "I break the waves / I feel the sun upon my face."</TE>
<TE>   Just as U2 spoke of "All That You Can't Leave Behind" as a return
to its core sound, Springsteen sees "The Rising" as a return to the
"center of the dialogue" he has had with his fans in such landmark
albums as "Born to Run," "Darkness on the Edge of Town," "The River"
and "Born in the U.S.A."</TE>
<TE>   In 1997's "Tunnel of Love," one of his best collections,
Springsteen began moving in a different direction. He was talking
about adulthood and the relationship between men and women. He
addressed some of those themes in 1992's "Human Touch" and "Lucky
Town."</TE>
<TE>   "I think some fans were very interested in those themes and some
probably weren't as interested," he says now. "I met a guy outside a
restaurant after 'Tunnel of Love' and he said, 'Hey Bruce, I like the
[old] songs about the cars and the girls.' I thought, 'Hey, if I'm
listening to Chuck Berry, I like the songs about the cars and the
girls too,' so I could understand what he was saying.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think it's important to move around as an artist to stay
alive creatively. You can't just sit in one spot for 30 years. There
is a time when you want to get back to the center of what you do,
however, and that's what we've done with this record. It's more about
writing with a little more about the world outside in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tough city and a tough country, and they'll both be all
right. I felt a lot of anxiety in the air after 9/11, but I also felt
a lot of optimism and faith and spirit. That's what I wanted to
capture in the album."</TE>

<HD>The Tracks of the Past Are Music to His Ears</HD>
<DH>David Hollander prides himself on unearthing bygone beats
he's discovered in obscure music libraries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA HUNDLEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two turntables form the epicenter of David Hollander's Fairfax
District studio, and the 32-year-old DJ, artist, filmmaker and
archivist flutters around them like moth to flame, digging through
hundreds of records and playing beautifully obscure bits of
underground rap, '60s soul and mid-'70s Euro-funk.</LD>
<LD>   It's the kind of music that has made Hollander something of a hero
in the world of music esoterica--not for performing it, but for
liberating it from music libraries in the U.S. and abroad.</LD>
<LD>   Hollander has issued a series of albums under the title
"Cinemaphonic," each one drawn from a particular country.
"Cinemaphonic: Electro Soul," released in 2000 on the Emperor Norton
label, unearthed groovy gems from the few American-based library
companies. Moving to New York's Motel Records, he put out
"Cinemaphonic: Soul Punch," which culled tracks from the fuzz-guitar
soul and bachelor-pad swing of the British libraries of the late '60s
and '70s. Motel will soon schedule the release the third installment,
"Heavy," consisting of deep bass funk and early electronica rescued
from German archives of the late '70s and '80s.</LD>
<TE>   His own releases are, he says, "a sampler's paradise," a mix of
infectious funk grind and space-age grooves, crime-jazz bass and
sweet '70s soul that could form the potential backbone for a
limitless number of hits.</TE>
<TE>   "In the DJ world we have a thing called break records, which are
isolated pieces of music which are basically tools to make your own
songs," explains Cut Chemist, a DJ in two prominent L.A. bands,
Ozomatli and Jurassic 5. "I always felt like library music was kind
of the predecessor to that.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think that David chose music for this compilation which is
more like finished songs, which is interesting. I liked that, because
then I can listen to it without feeling all tense, waiting for the
beat I can use. I can just sit back relax and enjoy. I love the
period he chose, as well. This kind of plasticy, spacey period in the
70s."</TE>
<TE>   Or in the words of DJ Swamp, one of the world's premiere
turntablists and a mainstay of Beck's band, "This stuff is the
original beat. It makes gangsta rap look like Romper Room."</TE>
<TE>   Hollander has just returned from a trip to Europe, but he's
bouncing around his studio with an energy usually reserved for
5-year-olds. He spent nearly a month there digging through dusty
stacks of vinyl at obscure music libraries.</TE>
<TE>   For the past 40 years, the U.S. entertainment industry has used
many of these overseas production houses to provide inexpensive
soundtrack music for low-budget films and television shows.</TE>
<TE>   "These musicians weren't in the unions," Hollander explains, "so
the bottom line was: You want something to lay down behind 'Streets
of San Francisco' or 'Kojak,' you buy some tracks from the Italian,
German or British library music companies.</TE>
<TE>   "These companies would hire studio musicians, burgeoning pop stars
or classical geniuses, and pay them to jam on a certain theme. You
know, 'We need some up-tempo action jazz here, some bossa nova
grooves over here.' So you have literally thousands of tracks, made
by amazing musicians, most of them working under pseudonyms, just
wasting away on these shelves all over Europe," Hollander explains.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm unself-consciously a real fan of what I'm involved in
bringing out," he adds. "I'm not influenced by the reissue industry
per se, because much of what that industry is based on is the rarity
of the record. And the fact of the matter is the rarity of the record
doesn't always mean it's the best record. It comes down, for me, to
personal aesthetics. That's why in terms of reissues, I don't feel
like I'm competing with anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Hollander's formative experience as a child actor in the '70s (he
was in the 1980 comedy "Airplane!" and spent two years on the sitcom
"What's Happening!!") has fueled the fires of both his local DJ
performances (spinning under Lil' Earl, a version of his "What's
Happening!!" moniker) and his "Cinemaphonic" discoveries.</TE>
<TE>   But his search for the perfect beat is also inspired by his
longtime admiration for hip-hop sampling. "In some way, everything
that I do is connected to the culture of hip-hop, because hip-hop is
where funk, soul and jazz have been immortalized," Hollander says.
"It's sample-based beat production. I feel incredibly connected to
that. Not that I'm looking for a given break inside a given hip-hop
song. It's kind of the exact opposite. I'm looking for the beat that
isn't there. The beat that needs to be discovered....</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many things to discover, and one text always leads
to the next, whether it's music or film or books or whatever,"
Hollander continues. "I'm inspired to tell people about it. I'll get
so enthused about something that I can't sleep at night, my head will
just be exploding and I literally have to do something about it. I
think that curating things like that is sort of a lost art form."</TE>
<TE>   Hollander laughs and points to the turntable, where a gorgeous,
soulful bass line is floating up into the cool morning air.
'Enthusiasm really is a sort of holy state," he says, smiling. "It's
total bliss."</TE>

<HD>Ambivalent African</HD>
<DH>In William Kentridge's films and drawings, contradiction is
the human condition--especially in his South Africa</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>William Kentridge's charcoal drawings don't stay still on the walls,
they erupt in active dramas on video monitors, unfolding in the
herky-jerky movement of an early animated cartoon. In "History of the
Main Complaint," a well-fed, pinstriped titan of industry lies on a
hospital bed breathing through a respirator as his memories pass
before him, like visions along a highway, in moments of despair and
pleasure. Or in "Felix in Exile," a melancholic artist, depicted in
the nude, peers at a canvas as he tries to envision the landscape
outside his room.</LD>
<LD>   The man in the pinstriped suit is rapacious industrialist Soho
Eckstein; the nude artist, his alter ego, is Felix Teitlebaum, a
dreamy optimist. They have spent a little more than a decade
struggling with their consciences and with each other for the
affection of Eckstein's wife. In half a dozen brief, animated films
by Johannesburg artist William Kentridge, these roughly drawn
characters symbolically represent the will to power and the
concomitant feelings of guilt and remorse experienced in white South
Africa in the 1990s.</LD>
<TE>   "The films have the ambivalence of different values going through
them at the same time. In praise of doubt, as a long-term project,"
explains Kentridge. "Certainly, white South Africa is in a state of
ambivalence, but I don't think it is restricted to here. I think
living in a state of contradiction is the norm rather than the
exception."</TE>
<TE>   Ambivalence is a dominant theme of the retrospective "William
Kentridge" at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art beginning next
Sunday. Organized by Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art and New
York's New Museum, the show includes more than 60 charcoal stills,
two sculptural installations and a selection of his films, which are
the works that launched Kentridge's international career.</TE>
<TE>   The New Museum's senior curator, Dan Cameron, has said that
Kentridge's characters are white South Africans but the work is
"universally human." He told an interviewer in 2001, "They are
defined almost by the way they try to ignore the extraordinary
circumstances of their life and act as if any crisis can be
surpassed, which I think is a tendency in many cultures, including
our own."</TE>
<TE>   Kentridge, 47, was reached by phone at his Johannesburg home,
where he lives with his wife and three children. It is midwinter
there and he was sitting with a cup of tea and piece of cake watching
the sun drop below the horizon, as the temperature fell to freezing.</TE>
<TE>   Since his films made a splash at Documenta X, the 1997 iteration
of Germany's quintennial contemporary art festival, Kentridge has
been considered one of South Africa's premier artists. In the New
York Times, art critic Grace Glueck wrote of the retrospective: "In
searing images, he addresses not only the land itself and its racial
problems but also the general human condition ... of bourgeois lives
played out in the country's deeply dysfunctional setting."</TE>
<TE>   It all began with drawing. In 1987, a friend left a movie camera
in Kentridge's studio so that Kentridge could film the process of
making his drawings, including all the erasures and changes. "I'd
wanted to track the process of drawing as it came into being," he
explains. "Often, there would be some point halfway through when it
could be freer instead of polished and tight. I wanted to track when
the drawing started to disintegrate."</TE>
<TE>   But the artist got more than he anticipated. "Halfway through the
first film, I'd drawn a character in a suit and a character naked.
Then I put a woman between them as a formal device to connect the
parts I'd made."</TE>
<TE>   Before he knew it, he had created Eckstein and Teitlebaum and the
drama that links them. But this is more like art-making than
moviemaking: The images come first; the story line follows.</TE>
<TE>   "The strategies are the strategies of drawing. I start in the
middle and let the process be the process of making clear what I want
to draw," he says. "Put a smudge on paper and gradually the image
will appear. Normally, you would start with a storyboard or script.
For me, the script comes at the end and the storyboard never comes."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Kentridge's approach was so intuitive that he had
completed "Johannesburg, 2nd Greatest City After Paris" (1989)--the
first of the series of works he calls "drawings for
projection"--before realizing that Eckstein's appearance was modeled
after that of his grandfather. And then there's the resemblance
between the artist and Teitlebaum.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Kentridge says, while they tap into his history and family,
the films "had to feel not as autobiography, but as a touchstone. I
have to be able to take responsibility for the characters in the
film."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the films address the issue of how one makes sense of the
life one lives," he adds, "what are the building blocks of how one
constructs who one is."</TE>
<TE>   Kentridge's building blocks include a distinguished family
history. His maternal grandmother immigrated with thousands of other
Lithuanian Jews to South Africa in the early 1900s. His father, Sir
Sydney Kentridge, who now lives in Great Britain and was knighted by
Queen Elizabeth in 1999, was an attorney in the anti-apartheid
movement. He represented Nelson Mandela at his treason trial in 1956
and the family of Steve Biko at the 1977 inquest into the activist's
death. The artist's mother, Felicia, is a lawyer who founded South
African's first nonprofit Legal Resources Center.</TE>
<TE>   Kentridge's privileged background was balanced by a sense of
obligation, even guilt. "I think there is not a white person in South
Africa who doesn't have something to apologize for," he says. "It may
not have been an individual desire, but there is no doubt that one
kind of life was led at the expense of other people's lives."</TE>
<TE>   Kentridge's upbringing led him to study politics and African
studies at the University of the Witwatersrand, in Johannesburg. But,
he says, he never planned on following in his parents' professional
footsteps.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a sense that my father had been too good a lawyer for
that to be an option," he says. "I thought I would be an engineer or
architect."</TE>
<TE>   He had been drawing since childhood, and after graduating in 1976,
he decided to study art at the Johannesburg Art Foundation with Bill
Ainsley, an influential artist in South Africa. Simultaneously, he
was interested in theater and helped form the Junction Avenue Theater
Company, a nonracial "theater of resistance" troupe.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, he went to Paris to study mime. Returning to Johannesburg
during the period of economic sanctions against South Africa, he
worked in theater and as an art director in films, all the while
making drawings. "It took many years to decide that indecision is
what I am best at," he says of his meandering career.</TE>
<TE>   He was, he says, "waiting to see what I would be when I grew up.
In the mid-'80s, a friend said, 'Now you are too old to be
employable. The only possible hope is to make a go of it as an
artist.' "</TE>
<TE>   Making a go of it meant that Kentridge exhibited his briskly
figurative charcoal drawings and prints for four years before the
borrowed movie camera pushed him in a new direction. After some early
film experiments, in 1989 he completed "Johannesburg, 2nd Greatest
City After Paris," which marked the debut of Eckstein and Teitlebaum
(they wrestle one another in a barren South African landscape). That
was followed by "Monument," in 1990, which shows the industrialist
erecting a monument to his good works and "Mine," in 1991, which
connects Eckstein to the diamond trade. Teitlebaum becomes intimately
involved with Mrs. Eckstein in the next work in the series, 1993's
"Sobriety, Obesity and Growing Old."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the apartheid system was slowly being dismantled, and
in 1993, the U.N. lifted sanctions. The artist could travel abroad
and critics and scholars began to visit. It was Catherine David,
former curator of the Pompidou Centre, who selected Kentridge's films
for Documenta X. That was his first major showing of the films
outside of South Africa, and the reaction cemented his growing
reputation in Johannesburg. Two years later, he was awarded the
Carnegie Medal from the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh. The
current retrospective, which opened in Washington in February 2001 at
the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, is the first major
exhibition of his work to travel internationally.</TE>
<TE>   As in the world of ambivalence chronicled by Kentridge, however,
not all the attention garnered by the films has been positive. He has
been charged with anti-Semitism.</TE>
<TE>   Kentridge, who is Jewish, has been criticized for the fact that
the rapacious Eckstein and the reclusive Teitlebaum were cast as
Jews. Kentridge defends the choice. "It would have been easier if I'd
drawn them as two Afrikaners," he admits. "But these are characters
who were familiar and despicable, two different aspects of Jews in
South Africa. Jews were more representative in the liberation
struggle than any other community. But it is also true that they have
been the worst industrialists. It is two sides of who we are. The
only people who accuse me of anti-Semitism are people who don't like
the mirror held up to them."</TE>
<TE>   These days, Kentridge alternates between work on drawings and
films and a return to his work in the theater. In the early 1990s,
after he had established the core of the Eckstein and Teitlebaum
series, he joined Johannesburg's Handspring Puppet Company, which
mixes actors, musicians, puppets and animation. For his first
collaboration with them, he reconceived Georg Buchner's Expressionist
soldier's story, "Woyzeck," and moved it from Germany to South Africa
in "Woyzeck in the Highveld." The production toured internationally.
Since then, he has directed Handspring's "Faustus in Africa" and a
production that puts Alfred Jarry's tyrannical character Ubu in
contemporary South Africa: "Ubu and the Truth Commission." An
animated film was made based on the Ubu production as well.</TE>
<TE>   Theater, Kentridge says, "is a comfortable sine wave between the
external and internal worlds. After 18 months with 20 people in the
theater, it is fantastic to have a year alone in the studio. After
that year, it is better to work with people again." (The LACMA
retrospective includes video clips of his theater productions.)</TE>
<TE>   And he continues to draw his two main protagonists, although
Eckstein alone appears in his films of 1998 and 1999. The theme of
ambivalence crops up whether he is drawing in charcoal or directing a
play. "There are no resolutions in my work," Kentridge says
thoughtfully. "These are reflections on different elements of their
lives, on loss, on responsibility, on guilt or violence, reflections
rather than descriptions of South African society."</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Working in a hit show and basking in critics' praise seemed like a
dream. But when Mel Brooks kissed him on the cheek, Brad Oscar knew
he had arrived.</LD>
<LD>   The big moment came during a recording session for "The Producers"
cast album, when Brooks marveled over his young star's rise from
obscurity to a featured role in New York's hottest musical: "This
usually doesn't happen on Broadway," he said, hugging the beaming
actor. "But it happened with this show, and when it did, we knew we
had found gold."</LD>
<LD>   Many have described Oscar's bright new celebrity as the ultimate
Cinderella story, and in one sense it is. But he didn't appear out of
nowhere to grab the leading role in "The Producers." Like so many
Broadway veterans, he struggled for years to make a living on the
boards, waiting for a break.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm one of the lucky ones," he says, realizing that but for a
series of extraordinary opportunities, he might still be playing a
small part in "Jekyll and Hyde" or waiting tables in the midtown
theater district.</TE>
<TE>   It helped that Oscar had friends and loved ones behind him. From
the moment he first showed acting talent, growing up in Rockville,
Md., his parents, Fran and Paul, and his sister, Victoria Oscar, also
an actress, strongly encouraged him.</TE>
<TE>   Brad's mom and dad--who were theater nuts in their own right--took
the family on regular weekend trips to New York to see the latest
musicals. "The turning point came when we saw Brad play Motel the
Tailor in 'Fiddler on the Roof,' when he was 14," recalls his father.
"He sang and I turned to Fran and said: 'When did this happen? He's
really, really good!"</TE>
<TE>   Oscar's career started slowly, with small ensemble roles and a
blur of auditions. He became an understudy in "Aspects of Love" and
was cast in "Forbidden Broadway," a spoof of musical shows that
included a six-month Los Angeles run in 1994. Lightning struck two
years ago, when he joined "The Producers" as an understudy to Nathan
Lane.</TE>
<TE>   "The story gets bizarre and bittersweet," Oscar said, noting that
he inherited the role of Franz Liebkind--for which he later received
a Tony nomination--when actor Ron Orbach injured his knee. "You live
for these moments, but I never expected they would come because
somebody got hurt."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't enough to play the parts well. Oscar had to be
deferential to the star, who was anguished over his vocal problems.
He was modest, when some cast members grew jealous of his media
publicity.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a rough business with two-faced, backstabbing people,"
said Victoria Oscar. "So you pick your battles and never burn
bridges. Brad survived because he's tactful. He's a team player and a
very generous person."</TE>

<HD>And Stardom Makes Three</HD>
<DH>A comedy about a man married to a popular French actress,
by a man married to a popular French actress? Yes, casting was easy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When French actor Yvan Attal set about writing and directing his
first feature, "My Wife Is an Actress," he chose a subject close to
his heart. Attal's wife happens to be French film star Charlotte
Gainsbourg. And in the screwball comedy that opened Friday, the two
play a married couple named Yvan and Charlotte.</LD>
<LD>   Attal didn't cast himself as an actor, but as a scrappy
sportswriter who has a difficult time coping with the fact that
nearly the entire French population seems to love his wife as much as
he does. Think of it as a Gallic version of the Oscar-winning
romantic comedies of yesteryear like "Woman of the Year" and
"Designing Woman."</LD>
<LD>   Attal, 37, was heavily influenced by American romantic comedies.
"I watched Woody Allen's films to write this," he said during a
recent interview at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. "He was a real
influence but others also--Billy Wilder, of course. Billy Wilder was
one of the best for comedies. Woody Allen, I think, he reinvented the
comedy genre. Comedy is a genre that is very minor--people don't take
seriously filmmakers who are making comedies in France."</LD>
<TE>   Gainsbourg, the daughter of British actress Jane Birkin ("Daddy
Nostalgia," "Evil Under the Sun") and the late French singer-actor
Serge Gainsbourg, says that when her mother started acting in the
1960s, "she only did comedies--she did popular films and she wasn't
taken seriously at all. Then she started doing very dramatic films
and was taken seriously. She became a recognized actress."</TE>
<TE>   In person, Attal and Gainsbourg come across as charming and
playful. Born in Israel but raised in France, Attal is short, dark,
talkative. British-born Gainsbourg, who has spent most of her life in
France, is tall, beautiful and quite shy. She watches her husband
intently as he does most of the talking. When he has trouble with
English, she jumps in to help him.</TE>
<TE>   To his surprise, Attal discovered making a comedy was not
particularly fun or easy. "You know, some times you arrive on the set
and you don't want to laugh," he says. "You don't want to be funny or
light. You have things happening in your life and you just want to be
serious. It's difficult to make a movie anyway, but there is that
thing in the comedy where all the time you have to be very precise."</TE>
<TE>   Besides wanting the film to make people laugh, he wanted "My Wife
Is an Actress" to have an elegant style.</TE>
<TE>   "We have seen so many comedies where the lighting is just flat.
That's why Woody Allen is so great. You see a film like 'Annie Hall'
or 'Manhattan' and the light and the style is so sophisticated."</TE>
<TE>   Attal had to rely on his production designer to give the elegance
he desired. "I am colorblind," he says, laughing. "Can you imagine?
What I discovered is my director of photography is also colorblind.
That's why we got on so well."</TE>
<TE>   Gainsbourg and Attal met 12 years ago while starring together in
"Aux yeux du monde" (The Eyes of the World) and became a couple a
year later. They have a son, Ben, who is 5. An actor since 1989,
Attal made his film debut in "Un Monde sans pitie" (A World Without
Pity), for which he won a 1990 best new actor Cesar, the French
version of an Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   Gainsbourg, 30, made her film debut 19 years ago as Catherine
Deneuve's daughter in "Love Songs." Two years later, she won a Cesar
for her performance as a tempestuous teenager in "Charlotte and
Lulu." Her first film to be distributed stateside was Claude Miller's
1989 drama, "The Little Thief," which was based on a screenplay by
Francois Truffaut.</TE>
<TE>   She essayed the leading role in Franco Zeffirelli's 1996 version
of "Jane Eyre," and earlier worked with various members of her
family. She starred in her uncle Andrew Birkin's 1993 film, "The
Cement Garden," appeared with her mother in 1987's "Kung-Fu Master,"
and was directed by her father in 1986's "Charlotte Forever." Last
year, Gainsbourg appeared in the TNT miniseries "Nuremberg" as a
Holocaust survivor.</TE>
<TE>   Attal initially made "My Wife Is an Actress" as a short film. "It
was a joke about what it is like to live with an actress," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The short film has a corresponding scene in the feature where a
man in a bar asks Yvan if he gets jealous when his wife has love
scenes in movies.</TE>
<TE>   "The producer saw that short film and he offered for me to adapt
it for a feature. I didn't want to. I said everything in six minutes.
I don't know how to make a one hour and a half movie on the same
subject. In the end, I accepted to think about it."</TE>
<TE>   Once he started to think about the idea, "I realized there was a
real subject--what is real and what is not real. That's why I did it
with my own wife. When I kiss Charlotte on the screen, is it a real
kiss? Maybe it isn't because there is a crew around."</TE>
<TE>   Acting, he says, is a strange occupation.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not a banal job when you spend a day naked with an actress
in a bed," he says, laughing. "At the end of the day you come back
home and see your own wife and children, and it's like nothing
special happened during the day. We don't realize how strange it is
to make films--to pretend."</TE>
<TE>   Gainsbourg is usually cast in serious roles, so she jumped at the
chance to do comedy. "It was really nice to have a character like
this--to be light," she says.</TE>
<TE>   It was a gratifying experience for Gainsbourg to watch her husband
as a director.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw his emotions as a director. I was able to come with him
while he worked on the music score in New York. I was able to watch
him work."</TE>
<TE>   Not unlike a lot of couples working together for the first time,
Attal and Gainsbourg got more than they bargained for, which they
admit sometimes created tension. "It was strange because you share
your life and you share your work," Attal says.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are an actor, at the end of the day you go back home"
from your job. "But when you live with the director, the work is
coming home because you are on the phone at home asking what's going
to happen tomorrow or what the weather report is. So she shared that
as well."</TE>

<LD>Thanks for Christopher Knight's article and criticism of Documenta
("All Politics, Little Art," July 7).</LD>
<LD>   At the conclusion, he asks how the art establishment got so dull,
and I have to answer: Chris, buddy, you have reviewed a dull show,
what did you expect? The art establishment is dull and probably
always has been.</LD>
<LD>   Trying to sell art like burgers is gonna do that, you know, and
here's a good test: Call a gallery and ask if you can show them your
work. You may or may not be surprised when they ask what school you
went to instead of asking about your artwork. You certainly know that
most galleries and museums are run by nice, smart, well-educated
people with pretty dull, conventional ideas. Once in a while
something cool slips through the deadening bureaucracy, but that is
the exception to the rule.</LD>

<LD>It is astonishing that The Times would publish Agustin Gurza's
personal attack on Grammy-nominated Cuban musician Juan-Carlos
Formell ("Enemies: A Musical," July 7).</LD>
<LD>   Formell is one of the best guitar players of Cuba--possibly one of
the best in the world today--and his approach to songwriting
represents a major innovation in Cuban music. Just listening to how
he incorporates pedal steel into his songs is worth the price of his
new CD, "Las Calles del Paraiso," aside from the fact that it has one
of the tightest, most proficient bands I've ever heard.</LD>
<LD>   Gurza is way off base in comparing Juan-Carlos Formell to Los Van
Van in any way. Juan-Carlos may be the biological son of Juan
Formell, but he is the musical heir to Jose Antonio Mendez and Sindo
Garay.</LD>
<TE>   If Gurza understood Cuban music, he'd know that.</TE>

<LD>Robert Hilburn's article on the new wave of rock bands was excellent
and inspiring ("Remember Rock?," June 30).</LD>
<LD>   I took note of Jack White's comments about his blues influences.
While rock will always need blues, the reality is, blues needs rock
even more. When I was a kid in the '60s, I discovered blues at the
Fillmore East. Bands like Cream, Ten Years After and the Dead led me
to B.B. and Albert King.</LD>
<LD>   I just played a show at Humphrey's by the Bay on Shelter Island in
San Diego (with the Mary Dukes band). As always, the reaction to Mary
was great. The thing people tell me and Mary over and over is that it
is great (and rare, these days) to see real blues. These days, the
blues played on the radio are not classic blues. I believe, however,
that people will respond positively to the real thing.</LD>
<TE>   But unlike rock, there are no super-rich people or companies
interested in spending money on blues. It would be great if, as in
the '60s, blues bands could do shows opening for rock bands that
support the blues.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not only does Hilburn's article, as well as his "The Best and the
Brightest of the Passion Players," smack of Johnny-come-latelyism,
but they strike me as entirely inaccurate portrayals of a so-called
scene that isn't even old enough to warrant a label.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, Hilburn betrays his obvious and well-documented bias
against the Strokes by placing them on the same level of relevance
and importance as the Vines and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and, in
the process, elevating the Hives to the same "status" in the scene as
the White Stripes.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has been following the mainstream music press on either
side of the Atlantic--be it New Musical Express, Q, Rolling Stone or
Spin--for the last couple of years could tell you that the true
trailblazers of this scene are the Stripes and the Strokes, not the
Stripes and the Hives. Even Howlin' Pelle Almqvist acknowledged in a
recent interview with MTV News that his band would not have become as
popular as it has without the benefit of those two bands coming
first.</TE>
<TE>   Why is Hilburn so reluctant to grant the Strokes the same credit?
After reading Hilburn's review of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts
Festival last month, it was obvious to me he was intent on
downplaying both the relevance and excellence of the Strokes' LP and
live show in favor of inflating his personal favorites. Perhaps
Hilburn wasn't present for the Strokes' set at Coachella; I certainly
wasn't at the Mars Volta's set. I can tell you, though, that there is
no way the Mars Volta could touch the absolutely magical atmosphere
of the Strokes set. It was breathtaking and exciting, the true buzz
of the festival--not the overrated histrionics of Cedric Bixler and
company.</TE>

<TE>   For once, I must agree with Hilburn ("Rock Passion Reborn," June
30). Rock 'n' roll must surely have become as devoid of passion and
creativity as he asserts, if we are now to find soul salvation from
the likes of the White Stripes, the Hives, the Strokes, et al.</TE>
<TE>   Why else should I pay attention to bands that try so desperately
to assume the pose and yet fill the air with such hollow music? These
guys make the Sex Pistols sound like Mozart. It couldn't possibly be
that Hilburn is trying another gambit to make sure we all listen to
the proper music, is it? Or that, in desperation to find the next big
thing, he's grasping at the latest coffeehouse phenomena to assure us
all that he's still got it?</TE>
<TE>   Face it, folks, these bands, lame as they are, still aim to be
every bit the famous rock star as any other commercial artist. That
they have wannabe rock-gurus like Hilburn fawning all over them is
just another step up the ladder of success.</TE>
<TE>   More power to them. Myself, I prefer bands that actually bother to
get a bass player.</TE>
<TE>   BOB LOZA</TE>
<TE>   Burbank</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The bands Hilburn described have filled a void in rock--with
ferocity, I might add.</TE>
<TE>   However, I was disappointed to see he neglected to include a
cornerstone band of this genre, the (International) Noise Conspiracy.
I saw T.I.N.C. about two years ago at the Chain Reaction in Anaheim
and also at the Roxy, and I was blown away. Within a year it seems
like similar bands began to sprout like crabgrass. T.I.N.C. is
definitely the forerunner in this area of rock. I think that it would
behoove you to, as Howlin' Pelle Almqvist of the Hives said, give
"credit where credit is due."</TE>
<TE>   I understand that T.I.N.C.'s political views are a bit extreme for
the sensitive capitalist underbelly of the great Western wonderland
we call home, but a good number of us embrace the revolutionary,
authority-questioning, passionate musings, distortions, croonings and
rantings.</TE>
<TE>   This is rock 'n' roll!</TE>
<TE>   TIM ROSE</TE>
<TE>   Costa Mesa</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The White Stripes, the Hives and the rest definitely deserve the
spotlight you have given them and their refreshing music. Maybe they
will reintroduce the role of radio and non-arena entertainment to
those too young to know otherwise.</TE>

<DH>Director Kathryn Bigelow's art-school lessons were
surprisingly handy for a submarine thriller</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of Kathryn Bigelow's teachers in art school instructed his
students to find their "most productive weakness."</LD>
<LD>   That seemingly contradictory bit of advice remained lodged
somewhere in a corner of her mind, and when she began directing
movies, Bigelow discovered what her weakness was. "Withstanding
pressure," she says. So she set out to conquer it.</LD>
<LD>   "I learned to treat the reality of constant pressure on a movie
set abstractly, like it was a mental process," she says.</LD>
<TE>   It's a character trait that was called on during the shooting of
"K-19: The Widowmaker." A $100-million Soviet submarine drama based
on a true incident on a nuclear sub in 1961, the film took seven
years to complete--but the shoot itself finished on time and on
budget.</TE>
<TE>   The credit for that, all agree, rests squarely on Bigelow's
shoulders. "It was a huge logistical undertaking," says Harrison
Ford, who stars as the sub's Capt. Alexei Vostrikov. "But I don't
remember ever facing the feeling of chaos. Directors have to be able
to think on their feet when the time isn't there, the light isn't
there, when the capacity of an actor to perform isn't there--and they
have to find a way to make it work anyway. Kathryn never would have
survived if she hadn't been able to do that."</TE>
<TE>   But it's the 50-year-old director's art school background, rather
than her newfound grace under pressure, that comes up repeatedly in
an interview. At other times, she compares the work of her B-movie
heroes--directors Samuel Fuller and Anthony Mann--to the "pure
expression" of Jackson Pollock and William de Kooning. She explains
her ability to flout conventions about women directing action movies
by saying her instincts were honed during her early years as an
artist.</TE>
<TE>   "In painting, there are no preconceived notions of what's
possible. You're always starting with a blank canvas," she says. "And
that's what's given me strength."</TE>
<TE>   "K-19" is based on the maiden, disaster-prone voyage of a Soviet
nuclear submarine in 1961. The threat of a nuclear meltdown aboard
the sub is a harrowing, little-known chapter in the history of the
Cold War. It was only through the clear thinking of the sub's captain
and the heroism of its crew that a disaster of global significance
was averted.</TE>
<TE>   Suppressed for three decades, the story of the K-19 came to light
in the early '90s after the demise of the Soviet Union. Rights to the
story were immediately scooped up by National Geographic's film
division after executives there saw a British-made documentary on the
subject, says Christine Whitaker, the company's executive vice
president of production.</TE>
<TE>   A story that focuses on Russian submariners and told from their
point of view may have seemed an odd choice for an English-language
feature film, but "one of the primary reasons we were attracted to
it," Whitaker says, "is that National Geographic has been turning the
camera on other cultures for 115 years. It fit in with our mission''
of expanding into feature films.</TE>
<TE>   Whitaker thought of Bigelow, who had made her name with fast-paced
action stories, including the biker-horror film "Near Dark" (1987);
the psychological cop thriller "Blue Steel" (1990), starring Jamie
Lee Curtis; the action adventure "Point Break" (1991) with Keanu
Reeves; and the apocalyptic sci-fi drama "Strange Days" (1995) with
Ralph Fiennes and Angela Bassett (her former husband, James Cameron,
was a producer and co-writer on that).</TE>
<TE>   "From our first meeting," Whitaker says, Bigelow "understood the
humanity behind the story. It wasn't just a submarine thriller. It
was about men rising above their circumstances and their politics to
do something for the greater good."</TE>
<TE>   The opportunity to illuminate this obscure chapter in history was
as much a learning experience for Bigelow as she hopes it will be for
the audience. "I had no idea of the Russian psychology at the time.
For me, they were horrible people who were going to push a button and
destroy the world.</TE>
<TE>   "This was such a great opportunity to put a human face to some
incredibly brave individuals without whom our lives would have been
changed."</TE>
<TE>   Bigelow developed the script with playwright Christopher Kyle for
the British production company Working Title. That was the easy part.
The project was stalled when Universal Pictures announced another
submarine drama, "U-571," released in 2000, and Bigelow went off to
make a more personal independent project, "The Weight of Water,"
starring Sean Penn and Elizabeth Hurley; after several delays, "The
Weight of Water" is to be released in November.</TE>
<TE>   After Working Title put "K-19" in turnaround about three years
ago, it was shopped to a number of companies. The overseas
independent company Intermedia agreed to finance the movie that, by
this time, also had an expensive star, Ford, attached. During
production, Intermedia contracted with Paramount Pictures to
distribute the film in the U.S. and certain key countries abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Just as the deal was finally set, a competing script materialized,
which led to litigation that was eventually settled, according to
Intermedia principal Nigel Sinclair. He is legally proscribed from
discussing the terms of the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   While the film was in pre-production, another real-life submarine
disaster occurred. In August 2000, the Russian nuclear sub Kursk was
lost and all 118 men aboard perished. After debating the propriety of
releasing "K-19" at that juncture, Bigelow says, she decided to
proceed.</TE>
<TE>   The Kursk disaster put to rest any doubts that American audiences
would respond to a story about an ill-fated Russian submarine.
"Sadly, the horrendous disaster of the Kursk had the entire world
spellbound, and the myopic idea that Americans only want to see
stories about Americans dissolved completely," she says.</TE>
<TE>   There were additional pressures, the most daunting of which was
that "we were working against a potential SAG strike and there was no
wiggle room in terms of schedule," Whitaker says. "We were shooting
in three different countries and the dates were not fungible."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, says Sinclair, all but 22 days of the 16-week shoot
were on water, an element that has wreaked havoc with the best-laid
plans (and budgets) of moviemakers in the past. ("Waterworld" being
the most calamitous example).</TE>
<TE>   "I flew up to Canada for the first day of the water shoot,"
Sinclair recalls. "There were 28 vessels, including two subs, two
frigates, 18 to 20 support boats and a naval helicopter. It was easy
to imagine a shoot like this going $20 million over budget. But we
didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Bigelow was raised in the Northern California city of San Carlos,
which she calls "a good place to grow up." As the only child of an
English teacher mother and a father who managed a paint factory, she
says she has been interested in art "for as long as I can remember.
Though I had friends, I was an introvert and I expressed myself
through art. Next thing I know, I'm at the San Francisco Art
Institute and my teacher has submitted my work to the Whitney
Museum's independent study program."</TE>
<TE>   She was accepted into the program and moved to New York, where "I
was given a studio for a year, at the end of which people like Susan
Sontag came down and commented on my work," Bigelow says.</TE>
<TE>   Soon thereafter, however, she switched to film, enrolling at
Columbia University. The reason, she explains, is that "painting is a
bit elitist, while film crosses culture and class. It's a populist
medium that people can access in different ways. That's difficult to
do with a painting. To understand it requires a background. In art,
context is everything."</TE>
<TE>   To anyone familiar with her body of work, Bigelow's love of
B-movies informs her style. "Near Dark" pays homage to such
time-honored B-grade genres as the biker movie, the western and the
horror film. "Blue Steel," "Point Break" and even the more epic
"Strange Days" are alive with a pulp sensibility. If "K-19" seems
incongruous in this mix, she cites B-movie auteur Fuller's 1954
submarine drama "Hell and High Water," with its masterful camera
moves in confined spaces.</TE>
<TE>   "I love B-movies, like Anthony Mann's 'Crime Wave,' because the
creative muscle [of the filmmaker] hasn't been put through the
Hollywood homogenization machine," she says. "They are pure
expression like the works of Jackson Pollock or Willem de Kooning.
There is a wildly chaotic rawness to [B-movies]. And they're not
self-important."</TE>
<TE>   From the preparation of "K-19" through its post-production, she
relied heavily on her gut and not her brain. "I work so instinctively
that I can't be cerebral too early. It would ruin the spontaneity."
Over-thinking a film's themes can compromise the drama, and Bigelow
says she chose to allow the film to emerge through the accrual of
detail, not dissimilar to the way an artist layers paint on a blank
canvas.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, on a project of this magnitude, there was no time for
musing or second-guessing. The meticulous construction of the "K-19"
sets was an intense experience. She catches herself, and laughs, "Oh
yeah, as you can see, I really got into it."</TE>
<TE>   The sets were built using photographic studies of the sub's
interiors and, just before construction began, the production secured
access to the blueprint of the K-19.</TE>
<TE>   "We worked on getting that over a period of years through the
process of declassification. As you can imagine, given the nature of
the history between the military industrial complexes of the U.S. and
the USSR and the fact that this was a nuclear submarine, it wasn't
something they handed out like a vacation brochure."</TE>
<TE>   The production bought a Russian nuclear sub built two or three
years after the K-19 and cannibalized the interiors. "Because we were
able to use all original equipment, we began to understand the
architecture of submarines, which are ergonomically designed so that
the instruments are all within arm's distance."</TE>
<TE>   The cast and crew underwent two weeks of "boot camp" training with
Russian submariners so they understood their duties aboard the K-19
as well as the demands and procedures of daily life under the sea.</TE>
<TE>   Built to scale, the sets were "extremely, extremely tight,"
Bigelow says, "no space, no oxygen. After spending months in these
incredibly microscopic chambers, you felt you had a legitimate
impression of what it would be like to be a submariner. It created a
verisimilitude that, I think, was necessary for the piece."</TE>
<TE>   The thought of Bigelow, who is 5 feet 11, and the film's two
leading men, Ford and Liam Neeson, who are even taller, crammed into
a small set with a camera and crew produces a rather claustrophobic
image. "Claustrophobia is not an option for submariners," says Ford,
although he admits "it was a bit of a challenge to find different
ways to keep the visual environment alive. One of Kathryn's biggest
talents is visualization, and she was very collaborative with the
actors in letting us find motivations for the kinds of movement that
reinforced the reality of the space."</TE>
<TE>   Bigelow says she devoted as much attention to the characters'
inner lives as to their physical environment, interviewing survivors
of the K-19 and Vostrikov's widow. "Her ability to accept what I
wanted to do and let me in emotionally was extraordinary, especially
given that I represent the Hollywood community, which has usually
portrayed the Soviets as either sinister or laughable."</TE>
<TE>   Transcending those stereotypes, she continues, was essential to
the success of her undertaking. "At the end of the day, in order for
the story to have resonance, you have to care about the characters,"
even if they were, politically, our polar opposites. Her sincerest
hope is that American audiences will come away from the film
thinking, "They were the enemy and I desperately wanted them to
live."</TE>

<HD>The American Dream, to an Outsider</HD>
<DH>A second Westermann show is a sober view through a
determined individualist's eyes.</DH>

<LD>The image of a grinning skull, set between a fiery pit and a
lightning storm, greets visitors to "See America First: The Prints of
H.C. Westermann." And before you make it through a small gallery off
the entryway of Cal State Long Beach's University Art Museum, you see
a naked woman cartwheeling from the top of a tall building, a
blood-red "Death Ship" drifting aimlessly at sea, the aftermath of a
train wreck, the explosion of the Hindenburg and six other air
disasters, including rocket ships plummeting from the sky and jets
slamming into the sides of skyscrapers.</LD>
<LD>   If such reality-based devastation isn't enough to get your
attention, the two biggest works in this gallery travel to the far
reaches of the galaxy to deliver even more chaos and mayhem. "Red
Planet 'J' " and "Green Planet Pi" depict tiny spacemen whose
futuristic outposts are being overrun by aliens that resemble
genetically altered dinosaurs and the mutant offspring of an enormous
lobster and Sesame Street's Big Bird. In two smaller prints, the
"Human Fly" and the "Human Canonball" perform daredevil acts without
safety nets.</LD>
<LD>   This is the stuff of tabloid headlines. In Westermann's hands,
however, it's also the raw material for a sobering portrait of
American culture.</LD>
<TE>   Life in the United States may be as vulgar and cheesy as it is
vicious and cheap, but that doesn't mean that there's no room for
honesty amid the overblown sensationalism. Both are hallmarks of the
53 images Westermann (1922-81) printed from 1962 to 1977. They have
been brought together for the first survey of his graphic works.
Organized by the David and Alfred Smart Museum at the University of
Chicago, the accessible yet far from easygoing show runs concurrently
with a retrospective of Westermann's terrifically out-of-step
sculptures at MOCA at the Geffen Contemporary.</TE>
<TE>   "See America First" is a comprehensive exhibition that stands on
its own and shouldn't be missed by anyone who visits its counterpart
in downtown Los Angeles. Accompanied by an informative catalogue
raisonne, it paints a poignant picture of one man's love of a country
he felt most at home in when he kept his distance from its social
conventions.</TE>
<TE>   Almost half of the images in the entry gallery are page-sized
black-and-white works Westermann made from commercially produced
blocks of Linoleum. Inspired by 1930s movies (like "The Bat
Whispers") and illustrated magazines (like Air Wonder Stories), most
depict imaginary aerial disasters.</TE>
<TE>   Three include cheery Christmas greetings, along with the date and
salutations from the artist. One diptych uses an old-fashioned
railroad crossing sign to spell out "X-mas!" Its right half is blank,
to be filled in with messages Westermann would write to friends.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the works in this gallery consist of two garishly
colored woodcuts, the tumbling "Mad Woman" and the soaring "Human
Canonball," and Westermann's first lithographs, a series he printed
at the Kansas City Art Institute in 1967. These include the
smoldering "Death Ship of No Port" (based on a German novel); the rat
infested "Port of Shadows" (based on a French film); the loony pair
of extraterrestrial landscapes (based on such American sci-fi movies
as  "Red Planet Mars" and "Rocketship X-M"); and the black-and-white
"Woman From Indianapolis" (based on Westermann's drive from Chicago
to Kansas City, Mo.)</TE>
<TE>   At once foreboding and slapstick, this image stands out for its
tight-lipped strangeness. Like a curdled version of an Edward Hopper
painting of a small-town filling station, Westermann's picture is as
enigmatic as a street scene by De Chirico and as biting as a
newspaper illustration by Mexican political cartoonist Jose Guadalupe
Posada. It also anticipates his next suite of prints, which,
installed in the main gallery, is the centerpiece of the show.</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, Westermann spent 2 1/2 months at the Tamarind Lithography
Workshop in Los Angeles printing his 17-piece series, "See America
First." Where his homemade, disaster-themed greeting cards put a
twisted spin on their mass-produced counterparts, his idiosyncratic
travel posters depict a world that's unlike anything advertised by
the tourist industry.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the Great Northern Railroad and the Gray Line
Sightseeing Co., both of which used similar phrases and formats to
promote trips to specific destinations, Westermann's works focus on
the interior landscape of the imagination. They are among his most
understated and open-ended pictures. Gone is the loopy, over-the-top
drama of his earlier pieces. In its place is the fascinating
stillness of an image that sometimes gets stuck in your head when
your mind wanders off on its own.</TE>
<TE>   Individually numbered, like flash cards, each print is also
emblazoned with the title of the series. In one, Bibendum, the
trademark of the Michelin Tire Co., marches across the desert,
followed by his silhouetted doppelganger. In another, a stick figure
makes haste down an empty city street. In the rest, a pack of rats
flees a sinking ship, a pair of sharks swims along a wildly sculpted
coast, Davy Crockett presides over a castle's tower, and a
pastel-tinted rainbow spills from the sides of a television, which
also functions as a fountain.</TE>
<TE>   A solemn Indian, a laser-eyed vixen, a gunslinger, a Day of the
Dead skeleton and a rangy polar bear round out Westermann's odd cast
of characters, all of whom appear to be misfits stoically making
their way through abandoned landscapes.</TE>
<TE>   The absence of spectacular sights suggests that what Westermann
liked best about his country was that it provided space to get away
from it all, especially from people who won't shut up long enough to
have a thought of their own. The go-it-alone spirit of a die-hard
do-it-yourselfer suffuses his images, in which solitude is a virtue
and the passing landscape provides plenty to mull over.</TE>
<TE>   Westermann's final two series occupy a long side gallery. Printed
in 1972 at Landfall Press in Chicago, "Six Lithographs" combines the
narrative force of his early works with the silent alienation made
palpable by "See America First." Lush jungle landscapes, active
volcanoes, Technicolor sunsets, lonely piers and godforsaken deserts
serve as the backdrops for anxiety-laced trysts, standoffs between
strange beasts, melancholic walks in the moonlight and lectures by
Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   These are Westermann's most technically sophisticated lithographs,
often combining up to nine colors in mixtures that rival the subtlety
of watercolors. Razor-sharp draftsmanship provides additional nuance.</TE>
<TE>   For some reason, Westermann did not include "Crash in the Jungle"
(based on a Chester Morris film written by Nathanael West) and "Oomu"
(based on Melville's 1847 novel "Omoo") in his handsomely boxed suite
of six prints. But they're presented here, along with numerous
studies, preparatory drawings and multiple versions of various
images, including a handful of cancellation proofs--the last run of
an edition, printed after its stone had been marked with a giant "X"
or a graffiti-like scrawl.</TE>
<TE>   Being able to compare and contrast Westermann's drawings and
watercolors with his finished prints is one of the show's biggest
pleasures. Consider his final suite of seven woodcuts, "The
Connecticut Ballroom," which he executed in 1975-76, just after he
moved into his new studio in Brookfield Center, Conn. The first of
the suite's prints is "The Green Hell," in which a naked man battles
a python. Its supersaturated colors and jarring graphics pack more
punch than the two drawings it is based on. The same goes for "Arctic
Death Ship" and "The Dance of Death (San Pedro)."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Westermann softens the colors in his printed versions
of "Deserted Airport N.M." and "Popeye and Pinocchio," which shows
the cartoon sailor punching a blue cactus as the crudely carved
puppet looks on in horror. Both images have the sun-faded feel of
objects left in the desert. The bare white spaces in all of these
woodcuts are animated by the worm-like fibers in the handmade Natsume
paper.</TE>
<TE>   The final print is a stark black-and-white image of an elephant's
graveyard. At its bottom appears Westermann's initials under his
personal symbol, an old-fashioned anchor.</TE>
<TE>   Although some viewers see this image as an instance of the artist
meditating on his own mortality, it's more accurate--and truer to the
spirit of the rest of the show--to see it as Westermann's view of
what it means to belong to a group. For the unrepentant
individualist, fitting into a community of like-minded look-alikes is
death.</TE>
<TE>   Long before American institutions embraced art as a token of
feel-good community-building, the peripatetic artist demonstrated
that eccentricity is the heart and soul of art that lasts longer than
yesterday's news. The irrepressible spirit of a sharp-eyed misfit
lives on in Westermann's unsentimental prints, which embody a vision
of the American dream that has nothing to do with the consumption of
bigger and better commodities and everything to do with a fierce
commitment to inspiring ideals.</TE>

<DH>The Philharmonic's assistant conductor chooses his programs
carefully, looking for links between works</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the middle of an interview, Yasuo Shinozaki hands over typed notes
about his programming choices for an upcoming concert at the
Hollywood Bowl. When the Los Angeles Philharmonic's assistant
conductor talks music, he turns thoughtful and then locks eyes with
his listener. When he conducts, the critics say, he minds order and
shape.</LD>
<LD>   All of which make one thing clear: For Shinozaki, music is in the
details.</LD>
<LD>   "If you look at this paper," the Kyoto, Japan-born conductor says
backstage before a recent Bowl concert, "you can understand why I
choose this program." It's the agenda for Shinozaki's Tuesday concert
with the Phil at the Bowl--Beethoven, Mozart and new music from Karen
Tanaka.</LD>
<TE>   Two things in particular draw the works together: Paris and the
relative youth of the composers when the works were written. The
opener is "Guardian Angel" by Tanaka, 41, a friend of Shinozaki's who
has been living in Paris and working at the computer-music think tank
IRCAM, the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique Musique,
for about 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   The piece was inspired by a passage from Exodus. "I imagine an
angel is falling down from the sky," Shinozaki, 34, writes in his
notes. "What a beautiful situation that is."</TE>
<TE>   The Paris connection for Beethoven's "Eroica" Symphony is a little
more indirect: It was inspired by a Parisian, Napoleon, and written
when the Austrian composer was 32. Mozart's Concerto for Two Pianos,
composed just after he got back to Salzburg from a sojourn in Paris,
was written for himself and his sister, Nannerl. He was 23.</TE>
<TE>   "He must have felt so happy playing this concerto," says
Shinozaki, a smile breaking over his face.</TE>
<TE>   Sister connections figure importantly in Shinozaki's life. Born
into a nonmusical family (his parents operate a restaurant in Kyoto),
the conductor first encountered music when his sister, Ryoko, started
studying ballet.</TE>
<TE>   "What that means is that every day when I was a child, there was a
lot of ballet music in the house," he said. "I was moved by 'Swan
Lake,' conducted by Seiji Ozawa, but only on CD, of course."</TE>
<TE>   The first symphony he heard, likewise on CD, was Schubert's
"Unfinished," conducted by Bruno Walter. "I've heard this music by
others since then," he said, his hands poised in the air. "But I
couldn't forget him. I don't believe that music is made only by
notes, the sound of tones. With Bruno Walter, something else
happened. It became music. It was magic."</TE>
<TE>   His hands drop when he tries to remember exactly when he decided
to pursue conducting. "When I was a student in kindergarten," he
said, "sometimes I was conducting to the stereo. When I was a junior
high school student, I went to many concerts. But it's difficult to
say when I felt, 'Oh, it's my life, to be a conductor.' "</TE>
<TE>   He studied at the Toho Gakeun University in Japan from 1986 to
1994, making his opera debut with Mozart's "Marriage of Figaro" in
Tokyo in 1993 and subsequently conducting at other opera houses in
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   To complete his conducting studies, he decided to go to the Vienna
Musikhochschule, where he worked with Leopold Hager from 1995 to
1998. He also studied with Myung-Whung Chung and the Santa Cecilia
Orchestra in Rome, and with Ozawa and Bernard Haitink at Tanglewood
in Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   "I was interested in Japanese music, but I'm very interested in
European culture," he said. "That's why I went to Vienna. I had to
learn a lot more music and I had to learn music in the center of
European musical culture."</TE>
<TE>   Everything lived up to his expectations. Well, almost everything.</TE>
<TE>   "I was disappointed only in the weather," he said. "All the time
in winter, it's always cloudy. But then I realized, spring in Austria
is very, very beautiful because it comes after such a long winter.
Schumann, Brahms, Beethoven, you know, they were so inspired by
spring because it comes after a long winter. Before I got to Vienna,
I didn't know that."</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Shinozaki won second prize in the Antonio Pedrotti
International Conducting Competition in Trento, Italy (no first prize
was awarded that year). He was 25. But his career took a more
dramatic turn when he won second prize at the Second International
Sibelius Conducting Competition in Helsinki in 2000. Los Angeles
Philharmonic music director Esa-Pekka Salonen was chairman of the
jury and invited him to audition for the post of assistant conductor
here. When Shinozaki's two-year appointment was announced in April
2001, Salonen called him "a wonderfully talented young conductor."</TE>
<TE>   "From the very first moment," said 20-year Philharmonic
clarinetist David Howard, "there was weight and a richness to the
sound of the orchestra that seemed shocking considering that no word
had been spoken to indicate that. It was a mysterious moment. There
was something about his body language. He had us playing with a
wonderful depth of sound."</TE>
<TE>   "It was an amazing time," Shinozaki said. "I had felt I had done
well."</TE>
<TE>   Shinozaki, who arrived in L.A. in August with his wife, flutist
Asuka, has spent most of his time here conducting youth, community
and neighborhood concerts, and he led the final Green Umbrella
program in April.His most visible moment, however, came in February,
when he stepped in for an ailing Hans Vonk to lead the Philharmonic
in a subscription Beethoven program at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   Acting as "understudy" for virtually every Philharmonic program is
one of his primary tasks as the Philharmonic's only assistant
conductor. (Miguel Harth-Bedoya, the orchestra's associate conductor,
also "covers," but only when he is in town.) "Always I have to
prepare for a cancellation," Shinozaki said. "Even five minutes
before, if some conductor gets sick or something, I have to go on."</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Vonk's cancellation, "I was lucky because
Beethoven's music is my favorite music. I prepared all of Beethoven's
symphonies. They are like the Bible."</TE>
<TE>   Reviewing that concert, Times music critic Daniel Cariaga wrote
that Shinozaki "made a strong impression" enforcing "orderly,
well-contrasted and motivated performances from his colleagues."</TE>
<TE>   Cariaga added that the audience "developed a new affection when it
came to the new conductor."</TE>
<TE>   Shinozaki is very aware of his listeners. "I may not to be able to
look at the audience," he says, pointing over his shoulder, "but I am
feeling a very big power in the concert room from the audience. It's
like magic."</TE>
<TE>   Shinozaki prefers conducting without a score, although for some
contemporary music, he uses one because of the music's complexity.
"But it doesn't matter whether you conduct with a score or without a
score," he said. "For me, I don't use a score, because that way I can
concentrate better and be closer to the music."</TE>
<TE>   Shinozaki has another year on his contract with the L.A. Phil,
which ends in July, before the opening of Walt Disney Concert Hall in
fall 2003. His schedule for next season includes three of the five
Symphony for Youth programs, and week after week, program after
program, of understudy duty. He will also return to Finland in the
fall to conduct two programs with the Finnish Radio Symphony. After
that, he is scheduled to lead the Osaka Symphony in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I am concentrating on orchestra music," he says. "But in the
future I would like to try opera too, because as, Herbert von Karajan
said, opera music and orchestra music are like a seesaw. There should
not be too much orchestra music, nor too much opera music. It's a
balance.</TE>
<TE>   "When if I am conducting a Richard Strauss symphonic poem,
'Zarathustra' or 'A Hero's Life,' of course I have to know 'Salome'
or 'Rosenkavalier.' If I am conducting a Mozart symphony, I have to
know his operas."</TE>
<TE>   He hopes the future also brings a permanent position as music
director.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to stay very long with some orchestra and make music
with my own orchestra. I am very happy to work in the United States.
I'm so interested in culture. Now I have a good chance to learn
American culture."</TE>

<LD>The huge successes of the Beatles mid-'90s "Anthology" TV series and
"1" hits collection only partly satisfied Fab Four fans' desire for
items from the band's treasured catalog and vaults. But one item near
the top of most Beatlemaniacs' wish lists is on its way: a DVD of "A
Hard Day's Night" with comprehensive bonus material.</LD>
<LD>   A two-disc package, due Sept. 24, will supplement the
groundbreaking 1964 movie--transferred from the restored original
negative and with digitally restored sound--with more than six hours
of new material.</LD>
<LD>   Among the extras: a documentary, "Things They Said Today," about
the production; a song-by-song analysis by longtime Beatles producer
George Martin; interviews with 30 key "witnesses" (from director
Richard Lester to then-child actor David Janson); three round-table
discussions with cast and crew members; a digitized copy of the first
draft of the script; and unpublished photos by Robert Freeman, who
shot and designed the Beatles' early album covers, including "A Hard
Day's Night."</LD>
<TE>   "Beatles fans have been waiting for this one," says Chris Carter,
host of the Sunday-morning "Breakfast With the Beatles" program on
KLSX-FM (97.1). "And it seems like it's being done the right way with
the bonus material."</TE>
<TE>   The film, distributed by Miramax since the mid-'90s, was reissued
for the big screen twice and then for home video. The company even
released a DVD in 1997 with just the movie, transferred from the
video and without any bonus material. It was withdrawn from the
market after a brief time. A similar release was done of 1965's
"Help!" The only Beatles film currently available on DVD is the
animated "Yellow Submarine."</TE>
<TE>   Martin Lewis, a Beatles historian and associate chosen to produce
the DVD by the movie's producer, Walter Shenson, who died in 2000,
went at the project with fanatical zeal.</TE>
<TE>   "As a die-hard fan watching [the ABC TV series] 'Anthology,' I
didn't feel I got too much fresh," says Lewis, who in the '70s worked
with Beatles press representative Derek Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than merely rehash the familiar tales of the production, he
turned to people who could offer new insights, such as hairdresser
Betty Glasow and Janson, who as a 10-year-old was featured in the
memorable sequence with a despondent Ringo Starr.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned so much about the Beatles and the film from people no
one else had bothered to speak to," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to digital technology, he also spotted some intriguing
minutiae. One that tickled him was the revelation that when Paul
takes his coat from a rack before the group makes its TV appearance
in the film, it can now be seen that the hanger it was on had
apparently been "borrowed" from the Plaza Hotel in New York--where
the Beatles had just stayed three weeks prior.</TE>
<TE>   And by using freeze frame, he was able to solve a mystery that had
been on his mind since he first saw the film as a boy in 1964. "In
the press conference scene, a woman asks John if he has any hobbies
and he writes something down, and the woman is aghast," Lewis says.
"For years I'd tried to discern what he wrote, but never could. Now
you can freeze frame and get the actual hobby--which is indeed
something rather rude."</TE>
<TE>   MORE BEATLES WISHES: The "A Hard Day's Night" DVD release will
come just before Oct. 5, the 40th anniversary of the U.K. release of
the Beatles' first single, "Love Me Do," and will be followed in
November by DVD releases of the "Anthology" TV show and the Paul
McCartney concert film "Driving U.S.A."</TE>
<TE>   So what else is high on fans' wish lists?</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly something fans are pining for are overhauled remastered
CDs of the Beatles catalog," says Pete Howard, Beatles collector and
publisher of the CD monthly magazine ICE. He noted that the original
Beatles albums have not been upgraded since their first CD release in
1988. "If and when Apple decides to put the American versions of the
albums on compact disc, those would do very well.</TE>
<TE>   "But the 'Hard Day's Night' DVD is a big event," Howard says. "I
think for fans it will be a line-up-at-midnight event."</TE>
<TE>   DEAD OFF: The "family reunion" shows are bringing the Grateful
Dead's Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart on stage
together for the first time since Jerry Garcia's 1995 death. But fans
are probably out of luck if they're hoping for a Southern California
concert date.</TE>
<TE>   When shows planned for early August in East Troy, Wis., suddenly
appeared to be in jeopardy because of security concerns there,
alternative sites were discussed, including some in California. With
the Wisconsin dates back on track, there is talk of taking the show
on tour, but Southern California is not among the locations under
discussion--even Shoreline Amphitheatre, in Mountain View just south
of the Dead's Bay Area home, is looking unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Mos Def and Queen Latifah will be featured as actors
and soundtrack contributors for the movie "Brown Sugar," starring
Taye Diggs and SanaaLathan. Other artists set for the movie
soundtrack, to be released on an MCA Records album Oct. 1, include
Erykah Badu collaborating with Common (produced by Rafael Saadiq),
the Roots and Mary J. Blige....</TE>
<TE>   Respected singer-songwriter Greg Brown is honored by a stellar
roster of female fans with a tribute album, "Going Driftless," due
Sept. 10 from Red House Records. Among those on board: Lucinda
Williams, Ani DiFranco, Iris DeMent, Gillian Welch, Mary Chapin
Carpenter, Shawn Colvin and Victoria Williams. Proceeds will go to
the Breast Cancer Fund of San Francisco....</TE>
<TE>   U.K. electronica producer-musician Faultline has added a guest
appearance by New York rap duo Cannibal Ox for the U.S. release of
his second album, "Your Love Means Everything." The album already
featured appearances by Michael Stipe, Coldplay's Chris Martin and
Flaming Lips' Wayne Coyne. It's due Sept. 11 from Elektra Records....</TE>
<TE>   Going by the name Novel, the grandson of R&amp;B great Solomon Burke
and son of longtime Motown writer and executive Mickey Stevenson
(co-writer of "Dancing in the Streets"), has signed to Rawkus
Records, which recently became affiliated with MCA Records. He sang
and performed nearly every part on his debut album, "Velvet Sky," due
in January....</TE>
<TE>   Covering most of the seasons, James Taylor's new album, due Aug.
13 from Columbia Records, is titled "October Road" and features the
current single "On the Fourth of July," along with the song
"September Grass" and a version of "Have Yourself a Merry Little
Christmas." His first studio album in five years reteams him with
producer Russ Titleman, who worked with him on 1975's "Gorilla" and
1976's "In the Pocket." Sally Taylor, Taylor's daughter from his
marriage to Carly Simon, sings some background vocals.</TE>

<LD>   Don't expect the same old Shakespeare charades when Italy's
provocative Aterballetto brings Mauro Bigonzetti's acclaimed
full-evening ballet, "A Midsummer Night's Dream," to the Orange
County Performing Arts Center on Friday and Saturday. For starters,
the music will be a commissioned symphonic score by rocker Elvis
Costello, not the Romantic Mendelssohn pieces used by Balanchine,
Ashton and so many others. Moreover, Bigonzetti's dance style
promises to be just as contemporary. Below: Thibaut Cherradi, left,

<LD>   DAVE MATTHEWS BAND</LD>
<LD>   "Busted Stuff"</LD>
<TE>   RCA</TE>
<TE>   Matthews has retreated even further into the sanctuary of his own
sound, if that's possible, resulting in a gorgeous sonic flow with
absolutely nothing to say. Perhaps it is the fate of jam bands to
spiral into the black hole of their intoxicating live experience, but
"Busted Stuff" (in stores Tuesday) crosses the line from being pretty
compelling to just being pretty.</TE>
<TE>   Nine of the 11 tracks were written for an earlier album that was
scrapped in order to work with producer Glen Ballard on 2001's
"Everyday." The songs reworked for "Busted Stuff" are not helped at
all by being a kind of return to pre-Ballard form.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the anthemic promise of "You Never Know," most of these
tunes can't decide if they should perk up and be pop or just stretch
into a Van Morrison mantra.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of a decision, the band digs its own ultimately listenable
sound-hole from which the songs struggle to emerge.</TE>
<TE>   The title seems to refer to the fragility of our emotional states.
The irony here is that Matthews' comfort level is not nearly busted
enough.</TE>
<TE>   --Dean Kuipers</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   THE VINES</TE>
<TE>   "Highly Evolved"</TE>
<TE>   Capitol</TE>
<TE>   This Australian group's debut album is distinctly evocative of
"Nuggets," the mother of all '60s garage rock compilations--which
makes sense, as singer-guitarist Craig Nicholls' dad was in just such
a band, the Vynes. Still, the young group's music isn't strictly
retro, but more of that modern-classic rock that mixes in flavors of
'70s Detroit punk and '90s Seattle grunge.</TE>
<TE>   The collection alternates between piquant and sweet, like Skittles
for your ears. The players do a fine job of balancing the raw vocals
and gutty guitar swagger of such exuberant numbers as "Outtathaway!"
with more wistful, airy pop songs. Nicholls wails, screams and roars
with an unbridled sense of that thing that groups such as the Vines
(and the Strokes, and the Hives, and the French Kicks ...) have
reconnected to 21st century pop: rebellious fun.</TE>
<TE>   If the Vines fall far short of advocating revolution, they have a
broader palette than many similar bands, and their pop sensibilities
don't fail during such spacier moments as "Autumn Shade" and
"Homesick." They even get away with a dash of ska on the Wings-like
"Factory." The music's bright colors and crunchy-chewy texture don't
make for a completely satisfying meal, but it offers a momentary
pleasure worth savoring.</TE>
<TE>   --Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   VARIOUS ARTISTS</TE>
<TE>   "Music From the Motion Picture</TE>
<TE>   'Austin Powers in Goldmember' "</TE>
<TE>   Maverick</TE>
<TE>   The third Austin Powers comedy drops Mike Myers' time-traveling
secret agent smack in the middle of the '70s, and the soundtrack is
appropriately cheesy, campy and funky. A mix of vintage numbers and
new recordings captures the freewheeling decade's kitschier aspects
while underscoring connections between pop then and pop now.</TE>
<TE>   Beyonce Knowles, who plays the vixen Foxxy Cleopatra, bridges the
gap with the single "Work It Out," produced by the Neptunes with
sexy, angular oomph. Then she slips into her film persona for "Hey
Goldmember," an unwieldy fusion of smart-mouth lyrics and bits of KC
&amp; the Sunshine Band songs.</TE>
<TE>   The only true original version here is Earth, Wind &amp; Fire's
"Shining Star." Instead, the old days are revised in a Dr. Dre remix
of the Rolling Stones' "Miss You," not to mention Angie Stone's
funky-smooth modern rendition of King Floyd's 1970 hit "Groove Me"
and Paul Oakenfold's "1975," an uninspiring mutation of the absurd
disco hit "A Fifth of Beethoven."</TE>
<TE>   Myers' contributions amp up the comedy quotient, although the
silly Dr. Evil twist on Jay-Z's "Hard Knock Life" and the "poignant"
Powers pop-rocker "Daddy Wasn't There" don't entirely jibe with the
concept.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there's plenty of fun to be had. And, really, bay-bee,
isn't that where it's at?</TE>
<TE>   --N.N.</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 Robert Plant, "Dreamland," Universal. The stark emotions
and simple beauty of bluesman Bukka White's dire "I Believe I'm
Fixin' to Die" and the prayerful plea and Middle Eastern cast of Tim
Buckley's "Song to the Siren" could well have composed the template
for Led Zeppelin. Plant and his band over-fuss, and a few originals
add little, but his time-weathered voice and perspective add
meaningful spins to the old songs and such other choices as Bob
Dylan's "One More Cup of Coffee."</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Hochman</TE>
<TE>   *** N.O.R.E., "God's Favorite," Def Jam. The former Noreaga scores
major points for his unorthodox phrasing and enthusiastic delivery.
With his third album, he continues making danceable gangster rap.
All-star production team the Neptunes creates warped magic on the
single "Nothin' " and delivers muscular keyboard thumps on "Head
Bussa." "Love Ya Moms," which samples Cyndi Lauper's "Time After
Time," shows thugs need--and can give-- love too.</TE>
<TE>   --Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   *** Orbital, "Back to Mine," DMC. As you might expect, the latest
mix collection from the U.K. electronic act is anything but a
standard dance compilation. The brothers Hartnoll establish the
"expect the unexpected" tone with the opening selection, John Barry &amp;
His Orchestra's theme from "The Knack." The dance world is also well
represented with the likes of EON's synthesizer-heavy "Spice."
However, by venturing far out of the genre, Orbital allows fans to
feel as if they're getting a look into the duo's private record
collection.</TE>

<HD>When the Power Fails</HD>
<DH>In dance, the breakdown of prowess is nearly as important
as strength as a potent form of communication</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly a decade ago in the Sahara, just outside Timbuktu, I saw
dances by the nomadic Tuareg people--the women in black, the men in
deep indigo with turbans that covered their faces except for their
eyes.</LD>
<LD>   A one-legged youth kept joining these dances, always with greater
energy and bravado than everyone else. If the others danced for their
own pleasure, he seemed propelled by another agenda--not, I think, to
solicit sympathy, but to show that he belonged, to stay in the game.</LD>
<LD>   In world dance, physical prowess defines an individual's place in
a specific culture, the absorption of its value systems and its
ideals of manhood or womanhood. Similarly, in much of European and
American concert dance, prowess usually reflects our obsession with
youth and fitness, in a heightened and celebratory form.</LD>
<TE>   But as important as prowess is in dance, there is a long tradition
of dramatizing its breakdown or destruction as a potent form of
movement communication.</TE>
<TE>   After all, the game eventually ends. While some concert dance
forms can be performed with high proficiency in old age (notably
tap), dancer prowess often erodes quickly and cruelly. Dance makers
have long interpreted that loss metaphorically, depicting crises in
human endurance or showing the skill that comes with dance training
as a kind of mask, with the real dancer revealed only when it is
stripped off.</TE>
<TE>   Consider a quote from choreographer James Kudelka, now artistic
director of National Ballet of Canada, who once said that he likes to
exhaust his dancers early in a piece. "I believe the point of
exhaustion is when people move the way they really move," he said.
"All the pretenses drop away and they really start seeing that it's
got to come from another place that's much deeper inside."</TE>
<TE>   "A dancer, more than any other human being, dies two deaths,"
wrote modern dance icon Martha Graham in her autobiography. "The
first, the physical, when the powerfully trained body will no longer
respond as you would wish."</TE>
<TE>   Although Graham never choreographed a work on that potent theme,
you can find plenty of dances that depict the destruction of physical
power.</TE>
<TE>   In the ballet "Giselle," for instance, the title character dances
herself to death, her unwelcome suitor Hilarion soon succumbs to the
same fate and her beloved Albrecht dances nearly to the point of
extinction at the end of the ballet.</TE>
<TE>   In such passages, the priorities of a veteran dancer summoning all
his resources to perform a taxing role can neatly dovetail with the
priorities of a choreographer showing a character attempting to
survive a dangerous ordeal.</TE>
<TE>   When Argentine ballet star Julio Bocca first danced Albrecht, he
feigned exhaustion, he said recently. "But when I do a ballet, I use
what I feel, and now, at 35, I'm really tired at that moment, and I
show it."</TE>
<TE>   At 34, Ukrainian ballet star Vladimir Malakhov also says that
Albrecht's dancing leaves him "without energy because I give
everything away and put all my energy [into Albrecht's need] to
survive somehow." However, he, like Bocca, is careful about the shape
he makes when Albrecht collapses, trying "to fall in a nice position,
not with one leg to the left and one to the right."</TE>
<TE>   One of the 20th century's earliest and most strangely personal
depictions of prowess' destruction comes in "The Rite of Spring," a
seminal one-act evocation of pagan Russia choreographed in 1913 by
Vaslav Nijinsky, the greatest virtuoso of his time.</TE>
<TE>   In the finale, a village maiden is sacrificed by dancing herself
to death in a twisted turned-in movement style that was wildly
controversial at the work's premiere. "Everything you do is pulled
down into the earth," according to Carole Valleskey, one of two
dancers who alternated in the role when the Joffrey Ballet
reconstructed the ballet in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   "Dancing it, you really became exhausted and glad when the end was
near," she remembered recently. "But that feeling served the role
really well because the character has to come to an acceptance of her
fate, a sort of welcome that all the pain is going to be over."</TE>
<TE>   "When you read Nijinsky's diaries, you understand that he saw
himself as a sacrificial victim," Valleskey said. "So I used to
identify the role with Nijinsky himself. What he gave the dancer to
do was something he was noted for: jumping. But instead of creating
straightforward jumps, he made them inverted, awkward and desperate,
leading to collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "In that sense, Nijinsky showed himself being offered up as a
jumping sacrifice. That role was him."</TE>
<TE>   The over-reliance on technique in all forms of concert dance
inspired major backlashes in the last half of the 20th century: such
anti-prowess idioms as postmodernism, with its initial emphasis on
everyday movement and rejection of virtuosity, and radical Japanese
butoh, with its focus on cycles of decay and regeneration alien to
the concept of dance as hyper-athletic.</TE>
<TE>   Emerging from the aftermath of World War II, butoh began in
violent improvisation but soon grew so meditative, so anti-physical,
so much about sensibility rather than skill, that its principal
founder, Tatsumi Hijikata, once called it "the dance of the
unmovables."</TE>
<TE>   "Tokyo people are now very busy talking of things like 'Health
Management' and the 'Utopia of Total Health,' '' Hijikata wrote in
1985. "I, however, prefer to use the principle of 'weakness' as a
gauge. I try to measure men on whether or not they are overly pliable
and their lives too easy."</TE>
<TE>   So even though its performers have developed their own forms of
prowess--such eerie disciplines as dancing with their eyes rolled so
far up into their heads that only the whites remain visible--butoh
remains focused on immersion in preconscious states of being,
incremental processes of nature and earthy movement that resolutely
denies or camouflages technical skill.</TE>
<TE>   If Western-style "modern dance is like a thoroughbred racehorse,"
wrote leading butoh choreographer and company leader Akaji Maro,
"then butoh is like a camel. The difference is like the difference
between diamonds and cork, though both have the same elemental base."</TE>
<TE>   When 50-year-old former ballet star Mikhail Baryshnikov danced to
his own amplified heartbeat in the plotless solo "HeartBeat: mb" four
years ago, he brought to a wide audience a number of radical concepts
of prowess long simmering in the avant-garde.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the choreography reiterated prime postmodern commitments
to everyday, non-dance movement--jogging, for instance. And
performing the solo at his half-century mark inevitably made it teem
with intimations of mortality, the ultimate end of prowess. The piece
may have been created by Sara Rudner and Christopher Janney, but that
role was unquestionably him.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, its documentary quality linked it to a realm of new
work sometimes contemptuously dismissed as "victim art" but elsewhere
praised for a kind of truth-telling that dance had never attempted.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, for example, contemporary Bay Area dancer-choreographer
John Henry began creating a piece titled "Singing Myself a Lullaby"
that charted the effect of AIDS on his ability to dance. Installments
of the piece were performed through 1996, with Henry dancing as much
as possible each time and videotaped segments supplying what he could
no longer do. The final performances took place one month before his
death.</TE>
<TE>   A video documentary about the piece shows Henry seeming to age 20
years in one-fifth the time, fusing the two dancer-deaths that Martha
Graham spoke about and making the process of staying in the game--and
the examination of prowess--extend to the extinction of physical
being.</TE>
<TE>   Closer to home, the breakdown of prowess became a central issue
last year in "Feeling for Open Spaces, None for Crowded Areas," a
self-portrait in dance by locally based postmodern pioneer Rudy
Perez. Slowly feeling his way across the stage with a cane, the
72-year-old Perez used the limited movement options imposed on him by
severe visual impairment to make deeply involving statements about
isolation and the courage to go on.</TE>
<TE>   "In that solo is a phase of my life that I needed to deal with and
acknowledge," Perez told The Times recently. "The path that I go
through with the cane, the stumbling, the searching: All that
reflected my desperation and need. It's not only the business with my
eyes, it's also being older and trying to maintain the essence of the
intuition and the passion and the drive that I've always had.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying like the Titanic to stay afloat and go forward," Perez
said with a grim laugh. "I'm desperately wanting to adjust to
whatever the changes will be. But it's very hard when you really
can't see, and the future is going to be quite different from my past
life."</TE>

<LD>Let's go local.</LD>
<LD>   The people who run many of America's most prominent theaters are
thinking in those terms. More and more plays that address local
subjects and concerns are being produced in the same areas where
their stories are set.</LD>
<LD>   Such works intensify the impact of an essential element of
theater--the fact that it's always local, on at least one level. It
occurs in a particular place and time, among a small group of people
whose momentary communal experience will never be duplicated exactly.
Dealing with indigenous subject matter adds yet another layer to the
local quality of a theatrical event.</LD>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the Mark Taper Forum has commissioned seven plays
with only one requirement--that they be California-oriented. It's the
Taper's most extensive effort ever to create locally themed work, and
the scope of the operation may be unprecedented among major theaters
nationwide, according to observers of the national theater scene.
Most of the plays that are expected to emerge from the Taper program
are set in the L.A. area.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the Taper-commissioned playwrights are also working on
locally focused projects for theaters in other parts of the country.
Localism is not just a local phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A.-based comedy trio Culture Clash specializes in such
fare--and not only in its hometown. The group began its current phase
of locally themed work with "Radio Mambo," in and about Miami, in
1994, followed by shows about San Diego, New York's Puerto Rican
community and San Francisco's Mission district. Culture Clash is
preparing "Anthems," a production about Washington, D.C., in the
post-Sept. 11 era, for an Aug. 30-Oct. 13 run at that city's Arena
Stage. Next winter, a production of "Culture Clash in AmeriCCa" at
San Jose Repertory Theatre will include material about San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Culture Clash's "Chavez Ravine" will look at the history of the
community that was supplanted by Dodger Stadium in L.A. The same
chapter of L.A. history--the Dodgers' arrival--is also a topic of
another theatrical piece, Heather Woodbury's "A Tale of Two Cities,"
that's being developed by the New York Shakespeare Festival. The New
York half of Woodbury's piece is about the Dodgers' departure from
Brooklyn.</TE>
<TE>   A potential problem with locally themed fare is the strong
possibility that it might not interest anyone in other locales, after
the initial production. But that hasn't been true for Culture Clash,
said the group's Richard Montoya: "Radio Mambo" began as "a one-night
deal in Miami, but it has played all over the country and won several
awards. I think 'Chavez Ravine' would play well in cities like
Seattle, San Diego, Berkeley and New York. Every city we tour to has
a stadium issue." Added the group's Herbert Siguenza, "It's a story
of progress, urban renewal, families ripped apart, greed, politics
and baseball. Now that's an American story."</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean that every locally themed piece can or even
should travel. Another Taper-commissioned writer, David Henry Hwang,
said, "Theater does not require, and often cannot accommodate, mass
national audiences. I'm sometimes struck, when visiting smaller
countries that do not have a mass entertainment media, by how much
more seriously they regard theater as the medium through which they
can express their local themes and culture."</TE>
<TE>   Taper-commissioned writer Ain Gordon said that theater is "a great
chance for the chemical equation of community interaction, which is
something America is looking for, because we've otherwise disappeared
into our homes."</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, local plays are often new, created to
address a particular time as well as a place. But the topics of such
plays often reach back into history. For two years, L.A.'s Edge of
the World Theater Festival has included a component called the "L.A.
History Project," which resulted in workshop productions of 13 short
plays about episodes from L.A.'s past. Longer versions of two of
these, "Gatsby in Hollywood" and "Crazy Drunk," are now set for full
productions before the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Classics also can be adapted to local contexts. "I'm on a crusade
to assert that William Shakespeare is a Los Angeles playwright," said
Ben Donenberg, artistic director of Shakespeare Festival/L.A.
"Whenever I hire directors, I say to them, 'There is this new
playwright who dropped this play on my desk and said he wrote it
about Los Angeles in the present day.' I'm offended when I walk into
a theater that has a production that could be plopped down in any
regional theater in the United States." His company's current "Romeo
and Juliet" is loosely set in the contemporary Los Angeles record
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Theater intended for a particular community is hardly a new
phenomenon. Western theater was born as a community ceremony in
ancient Athens. The first plays were on Athenian themes, meant for
Athenian audiences. No ancient impresarios were waiting to take them
on the road to amortize the costs and enhance the profits.</TE>
<TE>   Yet as theatrical history continued through the centuries,
playwrights became less interested in making sure their work had a
local component. It was safer to set plays in distant places or times
than to risk offending anyone in the audience. Playwrights'
imaginations ventured beyond geographic boundaries, not only for the
sake of artistic freedom, but also because plays that seemed too
"regional" might not be produced elsewhere, resulting in fewer
royalties for the writers.</TE>
<TE>   In the 20th century, a widespread nonprofit theater movement rose
to challenge the notion that Broadway was synonymous with American
theater. These professional "resident theaters," such as the Taper,
Pasadena Playhouse and South Coast Repertory, create their own
productions. But the subject matter of most resident theater
productions is seldom distinctive. Such theaters often face criticism
of predictable seasons made up of familiar classics, new versions of
recent Broadway and off-Broadway hits, and new plays that often
double as tryouts for potential commercial productions.</TE>
<TE>   On the fringes of the theatrical scene, however, several
institutions stayed true to theater's local roots, becoming known for
work that was specifically tailored for their audiences. One hotbed
of such activity was Northern California, where the San Francisco
Mime Troupe, El Teatro Campesino and Dell 'Arte Players tackled local
issues with a vengeance. Sonja Kuftinec, an assistant professor of
theater at the University of Minnesota who has researched such
companies, calls them "grass-roots" or "community-based" theaters
(not to be confused with "community theaters," which are usually
groups of amateurs doing familiar plays that are seldom on local
subjects).</TE>
<TE>   A decade ago, the previously itinerant Cornerstone Theater--an
exemplar of this kind of company--settled in Los Angeles, where it
has produced a variety of community-specific shows, plus plays that
combine themes and talent from several L.A. communities. Last week,
Cornerstone closed its latest production, "Crossings," written in
collaboration with members of five groups of Catholic immigrants to
L.A. from different cultures and performed at St. Vibiana's
cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the theater company has continued creating other
locally themed work elsewhere in the country, including "Public
Ghosts--Private Stories" last spring at the George Street Playhouse
in New Brunswick, N.J. That production, which delved into more than
180 years of New Brunswick history, was written by Gordon.</TE>
<TE>   The Taper invited Cornerstone to perform on the Taper main stage
in late 2000--the first smaller L.A. company to do so. The result,
"For Here or to Go?," was awash in L.A. references and characters.</TE>
<TE>   Not that it was the first locally oriented Taper production. Among
the most notable productions in Taper history were Luis Valdez's
"Zoot Suit" in 1978, which examined social issues in '40s L.A., and
Anna Deavere Smith's "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992," a 1993 response
to the riots of the previous year. There have been others, such as
Suzanne Grossmann's "Number Our Days" in 1982, about elderly Jews in
L.A.'s Venice.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always been interested in finding out more about Southern
California," said Taper artistic director Gordon Davidson, who was
raised in Brooklyn and moved to L.A. as an adult. He believes that
the Taper's thrust stage--with audience areas wrapping around the
sides so spectators can see each other--"encourages the feeling of
community." But he didn't have a formal program to develop locally
themed work until now.</TE>
<TE>   He found what he needed at the James Irvine Foundation, a San
Francisco-based donor that focuses on California projects. The
foundation had recently completed a project, "Connecting
Californians," that studied public performances throughout the state
that addressed local concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The Taper and the Irvine Foundation joined forces to create the
current three-year program of commissioned plays about California,
with Irvine contributing $300,000. Danton Miller, at that time the
foundation's program director for the arts (he has since left Irvine
and taken a job at A.S.K. Theater Projects), recalled that "the Taper
was importing a lot of work from elsewhere. The foundation wanted to
encourage more theater that addresses the needs of the community."</TE>
<TE>   Taper staff members compiled and Davidson approved a list of seven
playwrights, three of whom already were working on L.A.-set scripts
that were then folded into the Irvine project. Two of these three
scripts have been booked as part of the next Taper season. Lisa
Loomer's "Living Out," about East L.A. nannies and their Westside
employers, is scheduled for January, and Culture Clash's "Chavez
Ravine" is slated for next May.</TE>
<TE>   The third play that was already in the works was born in
conjunction with the Taper's decision to renovate the Culver Theater
in Culver City into the Kirk Douglas Theatre, which will serve as the
company's play development and youth theater headquarters. The Taper
called on New York-based Gordon, who had just finished his work on
Cornerstone's New Brunswick project and co-wrote the 1999 Taper
production "The First Picture Show," which was about early Hollywood.
The Taper asked Gordon to write a play drawn from Culver City
history. The resulting script is called "93 Acres of Barley." But no
commitment has yet been made to present it at the Douglas, which is
expected to open in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The other four plays in the Irvine project came about in response
to it. L.A.-based Naomi Iizuka, whose plays have been produced
elsewhere more often than in her hometown--and never at the Taper--is
writing a play on earthquakes and murder in the Los Angeles Basin.
Marion McClinton, best known in L.A. as the director of August
Wilson's "Jitney" and "King Hedley II" at the Taper, is writing about
three African American families who move to L.A. just in time for the
1965 Watts riots and their subsequent experiences through the 1992
riots. Hwang, whose rewrite of "Flower Drum Song" recently played the
Taper, is working on a new play based on experiences of the Los
Angeles band Hiroshima (already the subject of another Taper
production, "Sansei," in 1989). Jon Robin Baitz is, at least
tentatively, considering a musical that examines customs related to
death and dying, presumably in a local context.</TE>
<TE>   None of the four is slated for a production yet--and Baitz, whose
Taper productions include "Three Hotels," "The Substance of Fire" and
"Dutch Landscape" as well as next season's "Ten Unknowns," said he is
uncertain that he will use the musical about death as his Irvine
subject. Nevertheless, in April the Taper gathered all seven of the
Irvine playwrights for an intensive weekend of consultation with
local experts on the subjects about which they're writing. All
participated in sessions to learn about aspects of Los Angeles that
aren't directly related to their own subjects. They then discussed
their experiences at a public forum at the Taper.</TE>
<TE>   None of Southern California's other major theaters has focused on
local subjects to this extent. South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa is
nationally known for its new play development, "but we're looking for
long-term relationships with writers," said South Coast dramaturge
Jerry Patch, "so we go with what they're thinking of writing, rather
than suggesting it to them."</TE>
<TE>   However, Patch was speaking primarily of South Coast's regular
subscription programming. A block away from South Coast, in an Isamu
Noguchi-designed sculpture garden called California Scenarios, South
Coast presented a program of five short plays with California Latino
themes last summer, borrowing the name "California Scenarios" for the
title. That program will be repeated this year, July 25-Aug. 4. Also,
South Coast's educational touring wing has commissioned "California
Stories," a three-year cycle of plays on state history, for young
audiences who study California history in elementary school.</TE>
<TE>   On the South Coast main stage, local themes do appear
occasionally, most recently in 2000 in Richard Greenberg's "Everett
Beekin," part of which was set in Orange County, with one character
serving as a tour guide who offered comment on a pedestrian bridge
that connects the South Coast campus with the shopping center across
the street. New York-based Greenberg, who has spent months in Costa
Mesa working on commissions for the theater, "was making fun of us,
to our delight," Patch said.</TE>
<TE>   Patch contended that the smaller communities that once might have
gathered at a theatrical performance to examine common concerns
"exist less and less around the world. In California, the people who
have maintained a neighborhood identity have often done so because of
oppression, and even that is eroding."</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County lately, the highest-profile issue was the status
of the decommissioned El Toro Marine base, Patch said. While a play
about the El Toro controversy is not inconceivable, "our position has
been to find plays that really transfer to different cultures, that
reach across cultural enclaves."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the Taper-commissioned playwrights also hope
their plays will reach audiences beyond their original "enclaves."</TE>
<TE>   "I always think that Los Angeles is to America what America is to
the world," said Loomer, known to Taper audiences for "Expecting
Isabel" and "The Waiting Room." Although her new play is set in L.A.,
"it's a small way of looking at an issue in the world. I'm talking
about race and class in our time, and that's relevant to many
cities."</TE>
<TE>   Several of the Taper playwrights pointed to the work of August
Wilson, which usually addresses 20th century African American history
through the prism of characters inhabiting one particular pocket of
Pittsburgh. They noted that his plays have found international
audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Ain Gordon's "93 Acres of Barley" already played a few small
workshop performances in New York, where chances are that the
majority of the population has never heard of Culver City. "People
responded terrifically," Gordon said. He speculated that it probably
helps that "Culver City" is not in the title. If Thornton Wilder had
titled his masterpiece "Our Town, a Play About Grover's Corners,
N.H.," Gordon said, "it might not have gone so well."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Rauch, artistic director of Cornerstone Theater, said some of
his company's productions that seemed to be inexorably anchored in
particular communities have found audiences elsewhere, but usually
with at least a few adjustments in the scripts. He added that it's
important for such scripts to avoid being "too leaden and
realistic"--the more photo-realistic a script is, the less likely
that it can transfer elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Augusto Boal, a Brazilian experimentalist and theorist who visited
local adherents of his "Theatre of the Oppressed" movement in Los
Angeles recently, goes one step further--in the direction of
advocacy. "I don't care about folkloric theater that doesn't
transcend its region," he said. "Analyze a situation in a city, but
don't forget it's part of a world. And if you talk about
particularities, you should be trying to change them, not simply
reflecting or photographing them."</TE>
<TE>   But audiences sometimes like to see their reflection on a stage,
said Taper dramaturge John Glore, "whether they directly recognize
themselves or it's subliminal." And with the Taper plays, he added,
"no one will think they failed if they don't go beyond our
community."</TE>
<TE>   "Theater is the last form of communal fireside contact," said
Taper-commissioned playwright Baitz. "It's poignant. I don't know
what comes out of it other than contact in the dark. But I can't
think of many forms that are as well suited as theater is to that
kind of contact."</TE>

<LD>The romance between jazz and France has been going on since the
Roaring '20s, when American artists such as Sidney Bechet brought the
intoxicating sounds of New Orleans to the bistros of Paris.</LD>
<LD>   Although the earliest efforts by French jazz artists--big bands
such as those led in the late '20s by Ray Ventura and his Collegians
and Gregor and his Gregoriens--tended to be patterned after American
models, it didn't take long for Gallic originals to emerge, with
guitarist Django Reinhardt leading the way. A long line of others
followed--from Stephane Grappelli to Jean-Luc Ponty and beyond.</LD>
<LD>   So, on this celebration of Bastille Day, what better time to take
a look at some recent releases featuring French artists, from the
past and the present.</LD>
<TE>   Stephane Grappelli, "Live 1992" (*** 1/2, Dreyfus Jazz). Grappelli
is one of the greatest names in French jazz--for that matter, in jazz
anywhere. The violinist was, of course, an infinitely compatible
musical partner for Reinhardt during the '30s in the Quintet of the
Hot Club of France. In 1992, he organized a kind of updated Quintet,
including guitarists Philip Catherine and Marc Fosset with bassist
Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen. The results, as chronicled in this
reissued live outing, are vastly different from the work of the
original unit, but no less musically appealing. The association is
underscored by the presence of such Grappelli-Reinhardt originals as
"Minor Swing" and "Tears," but there are also plenty of standards,
with a special emphasis on Gershwin ("Oh, Lady Be Good," "Someone to
Watch Over Me"). Grappelli's soloing throughout, and especially on
numbers such as "I Got Rhythm," is the work of a jazz artist who
managed to combine elegant melodic phrasing with an irresistible
sense of swing.</TE>
<TE>   Michel Petrucciani, "The Owl Years: Days of Wine and Roses" (***
1/2, Sunnyside Records). The diminutive pianist, born with the bone
disease osteogenesis imperfecta, died in January 1999, a few days
after his 35th birthday. He was, by any definition, a prodigy, making
his first recording at the age of 17. While he may be best known in
this country through the recordings he made for Blue Note and
Dreyfus, some of his most remarkable efforts were produced for the
French Owl label from 1981 through 1985. Highlights from his work for
the company are packaged into this illuminating two-disc release.</TE>
<TE>   The tracks are filled with wondrous playing and, interestingly,
some of the most intensely introspective efforts are those recorded
when he was just turning 20. Influences from Bill Evans surface here
and there, but the startling fact is that Petrucciani was an
astonishingly original artist from an amazingly early age.</TE>
<TE>   The album's tunes are divided into mostly originals for the first
CD, standards for the second disc. A better choice would have been to
sequence the numbers chronologically, thereby affording insights into
the subtle transformations that took place in Petrucciani's
improvisational imagination (his technical virtuosity was astounding
from the beginning). Most of the tracks feature Petrucciani's solo
piano, which is easiest to tap into via standards such as "My Funny
Valentine" and "Prelude to a Kiss" (listen to his penetrating
exploration of the Duke Ellington song's already compelling
harmonies), but ultimately more rewarding in his freely flowing
originals. On one track, "I Hear a Rhapsody," he duets with alto
saxophonist Lee Konitz in a performance whose seeming simplicity
belies the sensitive, layered musicality of an encounter between two
gifted artists who were generations apart.</TE>
<TE>   Orchestre National de Jazz, "Charmediterranean" (***, ECM
Records). The Orchestre was founded in 1986 by France's Ministry of
Culture with a mandate that it change music directors every two to
three years. It now has performed more than 650 concerts in various
parts of the world embracing an enormous array of stylistic efforts.
Sadly, there is nothing quite like the Orchestre, with its
extraordinary freedom to open creative boundaries, in the United
States. "Charmediterranean" is a project conceived by Italian
composer Paolo Damiani during his two-year tenure as the ensemble's
director in 2000 and 2001. Included in the overall concept are
segments composed by Damiani, saxophonist-flutist Francois Jeanneau
(the Orchestre's founding director), oud master Anouar Brahem and
saxophonist-clarinetist Gianluigi Trovesi. The results are sometimes
thorny, often difficult, but never less than compelling.</TE>
<TE>   The three surviving members of Miles Davis' superb quintet of the
'60s--Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock and Ron Carter--have all released
new albums within a month of one another. Shorter's "Footprints
Live!" received a four-star review in this column in May. Recordings
from Hancock and Carter don't quite measure up to that level, but
their high quality is undeniable.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Carter, "Stardust" (***, Blue Note Records). Carter plays with
an unusual ensemble in this tribute to the great bassist Oscar
Pettiford. His associates--pianist Sir Roland Hanna, tenor
saxophonist Benny Golson, vibist Joe Locke and drummer Lenny
White--don't ordinarily appear with each other, each possessing
somewhat differing approaches to rhythm. But it is to Carter's great
credit that his powerful, in-the-pocket bass playing holds everything
together.</TE>
<TE>   The real appeal of the disc, however, is his soloing. Carter has
been so good at everything he's ever tried--from section work to
backing every imaginable style of artist, from composing and
arranging to teaching--that it's easy to overlook his inventive
qualities as an improviser. Although he is fortunately featured
throughout the album, he is most visible in a brilliant presentation
of the title track--a splendid example of a now-legendary musician at
work.</TE>
<TE>   Herbie Hancock, Michael Brecker, Roy Hargrove, "Directions in
Music: Live at Massey Hall" (***, Verve Records). This sterling trio
has been touring their celebration of Miles Davis and John Coltrane
with great success. Recorded live at Toronto's celebrated Massey
Hall, this recording adds bassist John Patitucci and drummer Brian
Blade (who are both present on the Shorter album as well).</TE>
<TE>   The selections range from Hancock's "The Sorcerer" and Davis' "So
What" to Coltrane's "Naima" and "Transition," Brecker's "D Trane" and
Hargrove's "The Poet." Everything is played with the world-class
professionalism one would expect from this caliber of players. But
the album's central quality does not reside in the craftsmanlike
ensemble playing, but in the individual efforts of each participant.
Brecker's work on "Naima" is a highlight, but so too are the uniquely
flexible lines offered by Hargrove, and the typically rich harmonies
and brisk accompaniments of Hancock.</TE>

<KH>JOHN BALZAR</KH>
<HD>It's Quite Simple, Mr. Bush</HD>
<DH>There's nothing fuzzy or complicated about basic securities
law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We have the law and we have the intent of the law--and the two no
longer seem to mean the same thing. So let's ask the question this
way: When he served on the board of directors of a publicly held
Texas oil company, was George W. Bush's conduct right?</LD>
<LD>   Was his work, for which he was generously compensated, "fair"? To
use the standards he voices now, was it "accurate"? Was it
"principled"? "Without moral confusion and relativism"? Did it
display "conscience" and "character"?</LD>
<LD>   Or was it another example of a corporation "disconnected from the
values of our country"?</LD>
<TE>   The president says that dealings at Harken Energy Corp. were
complicated when he was entrusted with oversight of the company.
"Sometimes things aren't exactly black and white," he explains. Well,
they should be. The law specifically calls for it. And if they
aren't, a paid consultant, "corporate director" and member of the
board's three-person audit committee should show his mettle by erring
which way in his judgments?</TE>
<TE>   Last January, in preparation for what was sure to be many months
of scandal, I went back and read the founding laws that govern our
free-market system, the 1933 Securities Act and the 1934 Securities
Exchange Act. I also read the mission statement of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which was born of these statutes nearly 70 years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   These documents are worth revisiting now because they seek to make
clear what Bush and so many others would have us believe is all fuzzy
and too complex to be grasped by anyone who lacks an MBA.</TE>
<TE>   Let's start with the SEC. Here's how the agency explains things:
"The laws and rules that govern the securities industry in the United
States derive from a simple and a straightforward concept: All
investors, whether large institutions or private individuals, should
have access to certain basic facts about an investment prior to
buying it."</TE>
<TE>   Can we agree that when Harken sells a chunk of its assets to a
group controlled by the family of its own chairman for $1 million
upfront and books the deal as a $7.9-million profit--thereby
inflating its performance--the company is not providing basic
information in simple and straightforward fashion?</TE>
<TE>   If there is doubt, the 1934 act explains that public investors
must be given "reasonable detail" about all of a company's business
activities and "reasonable assurances" that management has supervised
the accounting. What does that mean? The law spells it out this way:
"The terms 'reasonable assurance' and 'reasonable detail' mean such
level of detail and degree of assurance as would satisfy prudent
officials in the conduct of their own affairs." Rarely can we find a
statute prefaced more forthrightly. A thousand loopholes may have
been carved out of the law in the years since, but its intent remains
crystal clear: It is supposed to safeguard the interests of investors
and employees and society, not to serve as a shield for those at the
top who rake in the cash.</TE>
<TE>   Honorable people know, or should, what it means to manage a
business as they would conduct their own affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Audaciously, Bush asks us to believe that Harken's disreputable
accounting is an example of a system that works. Why? Because the SEC
ultimately caught the flimflam and made the company restate its
books. In the dungeon darkness of contemporary corporate morality, we
are told that since no one was actually charged with wrongdoing, then
everything was legal and right, thank you.</TE>
<TE>   The same with Bush's lapse in reporting his sale of his Harken
holdings. In this, he failed to meet a legal deadline designed to
protect investors against the abuses of insider trading. But
regulators in his father's administration deemed it not worthy of
filing a complaint.</TE>
<TE>   The president now hopes to restore the nation's faith in
corporations. He's counting on voters to believe in his sincerity.</TE>
<TE>   But the men and women of the boardrooms may be drawn to a
different conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to profits, stock gains, personal riches and
"corporate responsibility," do they listen to the president's
rhetoric about conscience and character or do they follow his
example? Do they say to themselves, if the president can get away
with it, why can't I?</TE>

<HD>U.S. Muslims, Unify and Stand Up</HD>
<DH>Leaders should harshly condemn terrorist acts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KHALED ABOU EL FADL</AU>
<BD>Khaled Abou El Fadl teaches law and Islamic law at UCLA
School of Law.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the pain-filled atmosphere after Sept. 11, I was one of the
Muslims who took a public and critical stand regarding the way both
my co-religionists and our government were handling the crisis. As a
result, I started to receive death threats from Muslim and non-Muslim
fanatics alike. The stress my family endured became unbearable when
police noticed that my home was being "staked out" by "unknown and
suspicious parties."</LD>
<LD>   A friend of mine, an Orthodox rabbi, urged my family and me to
stay with him, saying, "My friend, whatever befalls you let it befall
me--we are one!"</LD>
<LD>   I have lectured with this rabbi, and we disagree on practically
everything related to the Arab- Israeli conflict. But in his offer of
sanctuary, at great personal risk to himself and his family, he
represented the best of the Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions.
He represented what, in my view, is the true soul of our country, the
United States of America.</LD>
<TE>   Today, that soul is endangered.</TE>
<TE>   I fear that in the aftermath of Sept. 11 the terrorists will
succeed in placing the American tradition of tolerance and sanctuary
under siege. The social barrier against intolerance that
traditionally acts to muffle religious bigots in our country has been
ruptured. In one year, more than 20 hate-filled books, with titles
such as "Islamic Invasion," "The Truth About Islam" and "The Enemies
Among Us," have been published. Some voices that gained a public
platform went as far as urging the U.S. to rid itself of all Muslims
through deportation or other means.</TE>
<TE>   One thing fueling this rise in public bigotry is the anger
expressed by some Americans about the Muslim reaction to Sept. 11. On
this matter, I think that American Muslims should take a hard look at
the Muslim organizations that claim to represent them or speak on
their behalf.</TE>
<TE>   It is not an exaggeration to say that the leadership of these
organizations has failed to establish its credibility and to convince
the American public of the outrage felt by most Muslims over the
tragedy of Sept. 11. Various individuals and particular organizations
have issued isolated condemnations, but to date there has not been
something unified and overwhelming. Muslim leadership has failed, and
it has blamed everyone but itself for this failure.</TE>
<TE>   American Muslims must demand that either this leadership reform
itself or be changed. There are three concrete steps that already
should have been taken but would still be healing and powerful.</TE>
<TE>   * All major Muslim organizations should agree on a unified
statement unequivocally condemning terrorism and the Sept. 11 attacks
in the harshest language possible. All major American Muslim
organizations and intellectuals should sign this statement.</TE>
<TE>   * Muslim organizations should establish a unified task force that
provides information and assistance to the federal government with
the purpose of preventing further terrorist attacks against the U.S.
and apprehending anyone involved in facilitating or carrying out such
attacks. The point is that Muslims themselves should dedicate a
considerable amount of money and effort to assisting the government
in the war against terrorism committed on American land. They should
also invest significant funds in independent investigation and
inquiries for the purpose of combating terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   * These organizations should organize a massive march to ground
zero in New York to express the unequivocal opposition of American
Muslims to the terrorism of Osama bin Laden and his like. As an
expression of solidarity with the victims of the terrorist attacks,
the marchers should each deposit a flower or card at the site of the
murders. We Muslims must send a clear message to terrorists that they
do not speak for us and that they are not welcome in our midst. I
even wonder why this leadership has failed to undertake such simple
steps as printing and distributing bumper stickers saying, "Muslims
Against Terrorism!"</TE>
<TE>   Most important, whatever we do must be united, compelling and
convincing, not because we fear retaliation or harm by bigots or
Islam-haters but because this is what Islamic morality teaches us.
And because this is our country, and we must be at the forefront of
the war against those who wish to terrorize it into abandoning its
traditions of tolerance and sanctuary.</TE>

<HD>Drop Bid to Revive the Dying Salton Sea</HD>
<DH>Exposed lake bed should be treated to guard human and
animal life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRENT M. HADDAD and CHRISTOPHER J. BROWN</AU>
<BD>Brent M. Haddad is an associate professor of
environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz. Christopher J. Brown is a
recent graduate of UC Santa Cruz.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The years are numbered for Southern California's great environmental
accident of the last century--the Salton Sea. There is virtually
nothing that can stop that, but plans must be made now to keep the
lake bed that's left behind from becoming a bane to human health,
migratory birds and the local economy.</LD>
<LD>   Every few hundred years, the Salton Sea fills with flooding
Colorado River water, only to dry up again as the river returns to
its usual channel. Its accidental filling in 1905-07 has been
maintained for nearly a century.</LD>
<LD>   But the historical combination of farming practices, property
rights and the water demands of California's cities and the Mexican
border region is changing, which means that eventually evaporation
will outstrip inflows and leave the sea dry.</LD>
<TE>   At that point, three serious problems could arise: human health
damage as the region's population breathes the salty, pesticide-laden
dust and aerosols that are exposed on the seabed; the loss of a
critical stopover for migratory birds; and the decline of the
region's recreation/vacation industry.</TE>
<TE>   Trapped in the sediments of the Salton Sea are arsenic, selenium,
chromium, cadmium, zinc, lead and pesticides, including DDT. Asthma
and cancer are potential consequences of breathing air laden with
these particles.</TE>
<TE>   Other examples of air quality impairment from drying inland water
bodies include California's Owens Lake, which in recent years
recorded the worst airborne particulate pollution in the United
States, and the region surrounding Central Asia's Aral Sea, where one
of the world's worst public health crises continues to unfold.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Los Angeles is now taking action to stabilize air
quality in the lower Owens Valley by returning some water to the lake
bed, planting salt grass and spreading gravel on the surface.
Meanwhile, the human health toll in the regions surrounding the much
larger Aral Sea is staggering, with no solution in sight.</TE>
<TE>   As for migratory birds, the Salton Sea is a critical stopover and
feeding ground for millions of them.</TE>
<TE>   Substantial portions of certain species (eared grebes, American
white pelicans) use the sea each year. This resource will be lost to
them as the water dries up. Already the virulent mix of salts and
pesticides in the sea has caused rare diseases in some of the fish
populations, with resulting die-offs among birds as they eat the
diseased fish.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, recreational opportunities will disappear when the sea
is gone. Today, policymakers and environmental and recreation
advocates share a vision of restoring the Salton Sea, which would be
to stabilize its elevation and reduce the salinity in some parts in
order to support healthy fish and bird populations.</TE>
<TE>   These plans would cost hundreds of millions of dollars, which
would be wasted because, without sufficient water flowing in, there
will be nothing to restore.</TE>
<TE>   The correct approach should be remediation: protecting human
health, bird populations and the local economy as the Salton Sea
inevitably dries up. This would shift the focus of policymakers from
the sea itself to the exposed lake bed--something they can do
something about.</TE>
<TE>   We should undertake studies of how to immobilize the salts. With
respect to birds, we must search for alternative wetlands both north
and south of the U.S.-Mexican border, including restoring the now-dry
Colorado River delta. We must also help recreation and vacation
businesses plan for a future without the Salton Sea.</TE>
<TE>   Attempting to restore the Salton Sea would mean spending too much
money on a wish. Remediation of the damage caused by California's
unique agricultural history also would be expensive, but it would be
paid back in human lives and avian abundance.</TE>

<HD>Bad Cops: Feds Have to Act, Not Talk</HD>
<DH>The U.S. probe in Inglewood must break a sad trend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EARL OFARI HUTCHINSON</AU>
<BD>Earl Ofari Hutchinson is the author of "The Crisis in
Black and Black" (Middle Passage Press, 1998).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The instant that black activists saw the videotaped beating of
16-year-old Donovan Jackson by an Inglewood police officer, they
demanded that the Justice Department investigate and prosecute the
officer. The call for a federal probe has virtually been the mantra
when police are accused of beating, assailing or gunning down young
blacks. Black activists flat-out don't trust local police agencies to
self-investigate. Nor do activists trust district attorneys, grand
juries, police commissions or local officials--with their cozy
relationship with police--to be any more fair and impartial when it
comes to investigating the police.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department supposedly is a far different story.
Indeed, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft talked tough about the Jackson case
and dispatched his top civil rights lawyer to handle a federal probe.
This seemed like a sign that the Justice Department would do
something about the beating. Unfortunately, that is probably wishful
thinking.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the wave of dubious police shootings and beatings of
mostly young blacks and Latinos during the last few years, the
Justice Department has done almost nothing to nail abusive cops.
According to a 1998 report on police misconduct by Human Rights
Watch, an international watchdog group, federal prosecutors bring
excessive-force charges against police officers in a minuscule number
of cases involving allegations of police abuse. There was hope this
might change when President Bush and Ashcroft pledged to take a hard
look at racial profiling and police misconduct. But nothing much has
happened.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department has always had on the books a strong
arsenal of civil rights statutes to prosecute abusive police
officers. More often than not, however, it has taken major press
attention, large-scale protests and even a major riot, such as the
Los Angeles riots in 1992 after the Rodney King verdict, before the
Justice Department has used its legal weapons. It was only because of
the media focus on the police killings of Tyisha Miller in Riverside
in 1998 and of Amadou Diallo in New York City in 1999, and the threat
of mass demonstrations against police abuse, that President Clinton
spoke out against police violence in the waning days of his
administration.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft almost certainly spoke up swiftly in the Inglewood case
because angry protesters stormed the Inglewood City Hall demanding
action, no doubt creating visions of another civil disturbance in the
making.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors say they can't nail more cops involved in
questionable police violence because they are hamstrung by the lack
of funds and staff, by victims who are perceived as criminals, a
paucity of credible witnesses and the public's inclination to always
believe police testimony. They also claim they are hemmed in by the
almost impossible requirement that in order to get a conviction they
prove an officer had the specific intent to kill or injure a victim.</TE>
<TE>   These are tough obstacles, but no excuse. Federal prosecutors
should at least make the effort to prosecute more officers when there
is substantial evidence that they used excessive force. This is the
legally and morally right thing to do. Such action would send a
message to law enforcement agencies that the federal government will
go after lawbreakers whether they wear a mask or a badge. More
important, it puts police and city officials on notice that they must
take stronger action to halt the use of excessive force in their
departments.</TE>
<TE>   The reluctance of federal prosecutors to go after cops who overuse
force perpetuates the dangerous cycle of racial confrontation and
deepens the cynicism of blacks and Latinos toward the criminal
justice system.</TE>
<TE>   Black activists did the right thing in demanding a federal probe,
and Ashcroft did the right thing by answering their demand. However,
more than words are needed this time.</TE>

Changing World in the Age of Live Television."</BD>
<DL>AMSTERDAM</DL>
<LD>There's nothing like a national threat to unite a country behind
hard-liners. And there's nothing like a united country to cow
moderate politicians into silence--even when popular extremists make
destructive decisions. Such is the case in Israel today, where the
wave of terror has united the bulk of the country behind Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon's archconservative Likud Party, and moderate
politicians trying to hold on to threads of power can think of no
better strategy than playing dead.</LD>
<LD>   The Israeli government has undertaken many self-destructive
actions in recent months, but the two it came up with last week seem
just plain stupid. One was a Cabinet vote to back an amendment to an
existing land law that would ban Israeli Arabs from purchasing homes
in some parts of Israel. The other was shutting down the office of
leading Palestinian moderate Sari Nusseibeh, president of Al Quds
University and the Palestinian Authority's highest-ranking official
in Jerusalem.</LD>
<TE>   The decision to target a man like Nusseibeh flies in the face of
efforts to promote a different kind of Palestinian leadership.
Nusseibeh has denounced the current Palestinian uprising, saying it
is not a popular movement--a real intifada--but rather a "convulsion
of violence." He has loudly and clearly called for an end to suicide
bombings. He has taken the unpopular position that Palestinians must
drop their demand that refugees be allowed to return to Israel
proper. The Oxford- and Harvard-educated intellectual is the
antithesis of everything Israelis fear in Palestinians, a man whose
voice Israel should try to magnify instead of silence.</TE>
<TE>   Nusseibeh was out of the country when Israel's public security
minister, Uzi Landau, a hawkish member of Likud, ordered the closing
of the university's administrative offices, including Nusseibeh's.
According to Landau, by working for the Palestinian Authority within
the boundaries of Jerusalem, Nusseibeh was undermining Israeli
sovereignty in the city in violation of the Oslo accords.</TE>
<TE>   The matter of Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem is particularly
sensitive to Israelis. Landau used a politically charged term to
describe the danger, saying Nusseibeh could be used as a "Trojan
horse," with the university serving as an arm of the Palestinian
Authority.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojan horse metaphor has gained popularity in Israel lately.
Moderate politicians who supported the 1993 Oslo peace process are
accused also of having rolled in a dangerous gift from the enemy, as
the Oslo accords helped create and arm Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority. Many in Israel believe the flawed peace process,
undertaken by the Labor Party, sowed the seeds of today's disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction against the absurd decision to close Nusseibeh's office
did not come, as it should have, from the top Labor officials holding
positions of power in the Sharon Cabinet. Instead, it came from
former Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, a man viewed by many as a
pariah for his role as a key player in the government of former Labor
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, which outraged conservative Israelis with
its far-reaching offers to Palestinians at the Camp David
negotiations in early 2000 during the waning days of the Clinton
administration.</TE>
<TE>   Beilin, who last month challenged the Labor Party's ability to
lead the Israeli left and announced the formation of a new political
movement called Shahar, blasted the action at Al Quds, saying no
Palestinian has taken more risks for peace than Nusseibeh. The
sentiment was echoed by Yossi Sarid, head of the opposition party
Meretz, who called the government's decision stupid.</TE>
<TE>   The hobbling of Nusseibeh, though, seems positively brilliant next
to the proposed land law, a shameful measure introduced by an extreme
right-wing minister and approved by the Cabinet while most of its
Labor ministers conveniently happened to be away, providing them with
cover from the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   The bill provides for the legalization of "Jews-only" towns, rural
communities in which Israeli Arabs could not buy homes or even
reside. With the Cabinet's endorsement, the bill now has a clear path
to the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, where it faces legal hurdles.
The idea presents a serious challenge to the country's democracy,
prompting Foreign Minister Shimon Peres to say his Labor Party would
"fight with all its power against the racist decision," even if that
were to mean quitting the government. But the Labor Party has been
reluctant to raise its head in opposing Sharon's policies lately, and
it remains to be seen whether it will have the courage of its
convictions.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of banning Israel's Arab citizens from living in some
communities may sound acceptable to Israelis during this time of
constantly looking over their shoulders for suicide bombers. But when
the madness subsides, it will be apparent that the idea is an affront
to the country's humanist values and its democratic principles.
Israelis like to point with pride to the rights afforded equally to
all its citizens, including Israeli Arabs, some of whom are
democratically elected members of parliament. The land law does more
than erode Israel's moral strengths. It is exactly the kind of
discriminatory rule that hands the country's enemies powerful
arguments in their claim that Israel is a racist country--a claim
that has outraged Israelis and Jews for years.</TE>
<TE>   With a majority of Israelis still expressing support for a
political solution and the creation of a Palestinian state, and with
many Palestinians desiring negotiations as well, it is tragic that
the extremes have taken control on both sides. And by its actions
last week, the Israeli government seems likely to ensure that the
most extreme elements on the Palestinian side will gain support.</TE>

<LD>"I believe that the officials, and, especially, the directors of
corporations should be held personally accountable when corporations
break the law." Sounds like President Bush addressing Wall Street
executives Tuesday about the corporate scandals that have undermined
the nation's economy. Actually, it was Theodore Roosevelt in 1910 in
his "New Nationalism" speech. Then, as now, big business attacked any
regulation--and change arrived only after fierce political fights.
Bush, if he studied this history, would see that political survivors
ride the wave of reform rather than try to stem it.</LD>
<LD>   The first reforms came after the robber baron era in the late 19th
century. Before that, big corporations hadn't existed, so there was
no need for broad federal regulations to disclose the financial
health of companies to potential investors. After the Civil War,
railroad tycoons like Jay Gould used every trick in the book to
manipulate stocks, including issuing phony ones, to create gigantic
trusts and monopolies. An alarmed Congress created the Interstate
Commerce Commission in 1887. But not until trust-buster Roosevelt won
passage of the 1906 Hepburn Act was the commission empowered to set
uniform accounting standards for railroads.</LD>
<TE>   If Teddy Roosevelt championed saving capitalism from itself, it
was left to his nephew, Franklin D. Roosevelt, to carry out a
revolution in regulation after the 1929 stock market crash. In the
1920s, the financial information that corporations released was
largely up to them. There was little or no protection against
fraudulent stock sales. Even as he was called a dictator and
communist by Republicans, Roosevelt created the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which regulated the stock market and required
full disclosure of stocks being sold. The aim was to restore investor
confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the 1990s bubble has popped and companies are confessing
to cooking the books, New Deal regulations are showing their age, and
their loopholes. The auditing industry and corporations need new,
stiff regulations tailored to an age of corporations with intangible
products, like wireless services.</TE>
<TE>   In his Wall Street speech last week, President Bush huffed about
punishing corporate bad guys but ignored measures to prevent
artificial inflation of revenue and fraudulent bookkeeping in the
first place. He failed to push hard for an auditing regulatory board
free of industry influence. Nor did Bush mention stock options,
currently issued without counting their costs on the books.</TE>
<TE>   With dozens of pieces of legislation addressing misconduct before
Congress, covering everything from cracking down on accountants who
consult at the companies they audit to beefing up market oversight,
Bush has plenty to choose from. The most comprehensive bill remains
Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes' (D-Md.) proposal to make audits transparent
and create a public oversight board.</TE>
<TE>   Bush shouldn't just sound like Teddy Roosevelt, he should act like
him. History shows that public revulsion and investor anxiety will
force through reforms, whether the president and his corporate
backers like it or not. If Bush gets on board now, he can make the
reforms happen faster and claim some credit.</TE>

<HD>The Joys of Finding</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>What a summer for finding stuff! Just this past week we've had
exciting announcements about finding a 7-million-year-old hominid
skull, a 4,700-year-old copper foundry, a 500-year-old drawing by
Michelangelo and a six-decade-old PT boat that sank in the Pacific
but later helped float the reputation of a man who would be
president.</LD>
<LD>   An African college student found the fossilized skull protruding
from crumbling sandstone in Chad's wind-swept Djurab Desert. The find
is already changing theories on human evolution. UC San Diego
archeologists found the copper factory in southern Jordan. The
complex of 70 rooms crushed by an earthquake and frozen in time
provides a broken window into the unknown sophistication of the Early
Bronze Age.</LD>
<LD>   A vacationing Scottish museum director shuffling through Box 366
of uncataloged drawings in New York's Cooper-Hewitt design museum
found the Michelangelo. It was purchased in 1942 with others for $60.
The drawing's worth today: possibly $12 million. Shipwreck hunter
Robert Ballard, who found the Titanic and the Bismarck, has now found
the fabled PT-109 of Lt. John F. Kennedy in 1,200 feet of water off
the Solomon Islands.</LD>
<TE>   We sometimes have a misbegotten sense in this technological,
computerized world that we know more than we do. It's good to have
regular reminders of the pure instant joy of finding something new,
even if it's old. The simple serendipity of finding a rummage sale
gem or a coin on a beach, whether sought or unexpected. It's like a
momentary surprise party that's private. Recall the rush of relief in
finding a missing key or wallet. Remember the delight in finding a
grandmother's diary in an attic box, a missing family photo in an
ignored drawer or an ancient crayoned drawing by a child who was no
Michelangelo.</TE>
<TE>   Once there was a father and son whose occasional hobby was
creating things to be found by others far away, stuffing messages
into bottles and throwing them into the sea. Often, the father would
tuck the boy into bed at night and they would wonder together where
the bottles might be floating at that moment, how they would be found
and by whom. Such speculations created warm memories and dreams about
exotic places and interesting people far away.</TE>
<TE>   After the amazing finds of recent days by all those interesting
people in so many exotic places far away, we can only imagine what
other midsummer surprises are waiting out there. Who will find them?
Where? And what stories will they tell?</TE>

<HD>Hong Kong's Eroding Rights</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five years after Britain's handover of its colony of Hong Kong to
China, the sky has not fallen. Fears of soldiers in the streets and a
repressive dictatorship dismantling residents' rights proved
overwrought. But disquieting developments raise concerns about the
erosion of civil liberties under the formula known as "one country,
two systems."</LD>
<LD>   Much blame falls on Tung Chee-hwa, the former shipping magnate
whom China selected as the territory's chief executive. Civil rights
advocates criticize Tung for being overly subservient to China. Nor
has he been aided by the recent downturn in the economy, a major
concern in an enclave where businesspeople have always been powerful.</LD>
<LD>   Even before taking office July 1, 1997, Tung warned that some
freedoms might be sacrificed. In 1999, Hong Kong refused to let Pope
John Paul II visit. Last year, the territory refused entry to scores
of Falun Gong followers from abroad, even though the spiritual
movement was legal in Hong Kong. The ban coincided with the visit of
President Jiang Zemin of China; Falun Gong is outlawed there.</LD>
<TE>   Recently, Tung picked 14 heads of government divisions in what he
billed as an attempt to improve accountability. But the
accountability will be only to him, not to voters or legislators; his
selectees are unlikely to be as independent-minded as the
British-style civil servants who served Hong Kong well for many
years. Tung's lack of popularity with residents, as measured by
polls, did not stand in the way of his being given a second five-year
term by 800 electors cued by Beijing. He had no opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong residents deserve better than the exchange of one
colonial master for another. The constitutional implication of free
elections in 2007 seems unlikely to be fulfilled, especially after
the comment of a Chinese deputy prime minister this month that Hong
Kong's main need was "stability."</TE>
<TE>   The cars and delivery trucks packing Hong Kong's streets and the
supertankers in the crowded harbors can disguise economic problems
that are real and threatening. Shanghai could surpass the territory
commercially in a decade or so if it continues to improve
infrastructure and emphasize technology and if Hong Kong fritters
away advantages that include more freedom for residents and
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Stopping the erosion of civil liberties would reassure investors
that Hong Kong remains a good place to invest; more important, it
would preserve residents' freedom after more than a century of
colonial subjugation.</TE>

<HD>Northwest Spoiling Bids to Hike Air Fares</HD>
<DH>Airlines: To the benefit of leisure travelers and the
frustration of rivals, the carrier refuses to match price increases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Each day thousands of travelers nationwide book airline tickets not
realizing that they've saved a few bucks thanks to a handful of
executives in the Minneapolis area.</LD>
<LD>   They're senior executives of Northwest Airlines, and they're
making sure that the Eagan, Minn.-based carrier keeps spoiling
attempts by other airlines to raise leisure fares. Two weeks ago, for
the fourth time since April, several major airlines increased
leisure-ticket fares by $20 per round trip, then promptly rolled them
back after Northwest refused to match the increase.</LD>
<LD>   "Northwest is becoming the policeman for higher leisure fares,"
said Tom Parsons, who runs Bestfares.com, a travel Web site. "The one
calling the shots in the future, at least for a fare hike, will be
Northwest."</LD>
<TE>   It's a stalemate that's good news for consumers, because Northwest
is helping to keep downward pressure on leisure fares overall. In
May, for instance, the average domestic airline fare for a 1,000-mile
trip, excluding taxes, was $122.05, the lowest fare for that month in
more than a decade, according to the Air Transport Assn., the
industry's trade group. (The tally excludes low-fare giant Southwest
Airlines.)</TE>
<TE>   While consumers benefit, most airlines are losing millions of
dollars a day and screaming they need more revenue. So why doesn't
Northwest go along with a modest price increase? Because the nation's
fourth-largest airline believes even a small price increase will
discourage people from flying Northwest--or any airline--and actually
cost the carrier money.</TE>
<TE>   The other large airlines, such as AMR Corp.'s American, UAL
Corp.'s United, Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines, in turn
aren't willing to have leisure fares higher than Northwest's, for
fear of losing even a single vacation traveler to the holdout. So
they're quick to rescind fare increases if Northwest doesn't go
along. "We want to be competitive," Delta spokesman Anthony Black
said.</TE>
<TE>   The low fares partly reflect slumping air travel in the face of
the lackluster economy and post-Sept. 11 skittishness about flying.
But the airlines' inability to lift leisure fares also is a key
reason the industry, which will report its second-quarter financial
results this week, is expected to show a combined loss of $1.4
billion to $1.7 billion for the three months ended June 30. That's on
top of the staggering $7 billion the airlines lost last year.</TE>
<TE>   Northwest is expected Thursday to post a second-quarter loss of
about $103 million, according to Wall Street analysts. The company's
stock, at $9.63 on Nasdaq on Friday, is down 38% this year, worse
than the 33% decline of an index of 10 major airline shares.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the losses, the Northwest skirmish adds another twist to
the confusion and controversy over fares in general, and points up
the industry's struggle to significantly change how they price seats
in a way that will both boost their incomes and not alienate
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Reluctance to Cut</TE>
<TE>   Business Fares</TE>
<TE>   In terms of business travel, all carriers are being criticized for
the opposite problem--maintaining fares that are too high. Yet the
carriers have been reluctant to slash business fares even though they
acknowledge that they're suffering a drop in business traffic, which
is key to their survival. Two of them, United and US Airways, are
seeking federal bailouts in the form of U.S.-backed loan guarantees.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows" that the airline fare structure "is badly
broken," Donald Carty, American's chief executive, said at a recent
industry conference.</TE>
<TE>   Many contend that, for airline prospects to improve, business
fares must come down and leisure fares must go up. A few airlines,
including Northwest, have tweaked their fare policies to assuage
business travelers and, they hope, increase the carriers' revenues.
But making wholesale changes to fares is proving a formidable task,
with the airlines hesitant to provoke their customers, shareholders
or other constituents, or to risk having their rivals launch a fare
sale as means of retribution.</TE>
<TE>   Northwest believes that if it raises the basic or "list" prices of
leisure fares by even $20, it will promptly spark one or more rivals
to launch a sale that undercuts them, rendering the new "higher"
fares worthless.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Northwest contends that the simplified fare structure it
imposed in November, which reduces the need for constant fare sales,
ultimately will generate more revenue overall.</TE>
<TE>   Northwest won't discuss this publicly; airlines are skittish about
discussing fare policy for fear they'll be slapped by federal
regulators on antitrust grounds. Still, comments by Northwest
officials in the company's internal newsletter show that the airline
believes that, in this market, any fare increase for leisure travel
will turn away passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Northwest's matching of the others' increases "might have actually
led to more fare discounting, producing even lower revenue," Tim
Griffin, Northwest's executive vice president for marketing and
distribution, said recently in the airline's employee newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   "The vast majority of our customers don't ask for the regular
price--they want and buy the lowest fare available, so matching this
recent fare increase would not have improved our revenues," Griffin
added.</TE>
<TE>   Long Part of</TE>
<TE>   Northwest's Strategy</TE>
<TE>   Blocking others' fare increases is also part of Northwest's
strategy. "For years they've done it," said Jon Ash, managing
director of Global Aviation Associates, an industry consulting firm
in Washington. "Obviously they think they have a better pricing
formula than everybody else in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Ash said there's another reason Northwest has balked at joining
the push for higher fares: Northwest has long suffered a reputation
for poorer service than many of its rivals, even though Northwest
executives, including Chairman Richard Anderson, get good marks for
improving the carrier's service in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   "They feel the need to keep their fares low, because they can't
command a premium price in competitive markets," that is, on routes
where Northwest vies with American, United or other network carriers,
Ash said. "American Airlines can because they're perceived to have a
materially better product."</TE>
<TE>   Northwest, which carried more than 54 million passengers last
year, traces its roots to 1926 and was once known as Northwest
Orient. With 1,700 daily flights and domestic hubs in Minneapolis/St.
Paul, Detroit and Memphis, it's also a leading U.S. carrier to Asia
and has been a pioneer in creating alliances with other airlines,
such as KLM Royal Dutch, that extend its route system worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Improving Service,</TE>
<TE>   the Balance Sheet</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1990s, Northwest incurred huge operational, labor and
public-relations setbacks that damaged its image and prompted critics
to call the carrier "Northworst." The problems were capped by a
highly publicized debacle in early 1999 when more than 7,000 of the
airline's passengers were stranded for hours on the runway in Detroit
during a blizzard.</TE>
<TE>   Northwest's service has improved considerably since then and,
though it's still losing money, the carrier has emerged from the
aftermath of Sept. 11 with one of the strongest balance sheets in the
airline industry and more than $2 billion in cash at its disposal.
Some observers say Northwest's stubbornness about the leisure fares
also illustrates how its executives have become industry mavericks
who are almost cocky in their belief that the carrier has the right
formula and is sticking to it.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, none of the other big airlines "is willing to allow a
competitive mismatch with Northwest" by raising their leisure fares
without Northwest going along, said Gary Chase, an analyst with
Lehman Bros.</TE>
<TE>   But Chase also said "it's unclear whether or not Northwest's
strategy is paying off for Northwest" in terms of higher yields, or
average fares, that could help improve its bottom line. Chase said
those numbers will rise mainly on better supply and demand--if
passenger traffic goes up and the number of airline seats holds
steady or goes down--and not on modest fare increases of $20 a
ticket.</TE>
<TE>   Northwest says its strategy is working. In its latest monthly
report on passenger traffic, for June, Griffin said Northwest's
domestic yields are improving faster than the industry's. It is also
closer to regaining profitability than most big airlines. "Consumers
are responding favorably to our fares and our product," Northwest
spokesman Kurt Ebenhoch said.</TE>
<TE>   Northwest also adjusted its business fare structure, adding
"BizFlex" fares that offer fewer restrictions and deeper discounts to
travelers who book ahead. But other carriers are finding it difficult
to change business fares and please both frequent travelers and
investors.</TE>
<TE>   Consider: American Trans Air, the nation's 10th-largest airline, a
unit of ATA Holdings Corp., recently unveiled a simplified set of
business fares, noting that "it has become evident that air travelers
are looking for low, unrestricted fares." Indeed, ATA said its new
plan would slash its fares by 25% to 40%. But Wall Street appeared to
interpret that as meaning ATA's revenue also would drop, and
investors sold off the carrier's stock for three straight days.</TE>
<TE>   Bill McKnight, ATA's executive vice president for marketing, said
the airline's new setup eliminated high business fares that weren't
selling. He also predicted that the new prices would appeal to
business travelers, who increasingly are shopping for lower fares.
But Indianapolis-based ATA doesn't have the market clout that would
make its changes a template for the industry. Northwest, however,
does have the size to head off other fare increases if Northwest
doesn't feel like going along. And it usually doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   Northwest is helping limit higher leisure fares, but it's also
doing its part to keep those fares from dropping much further, said
Parsons of Bestfares.com. One goal behind Northwest's recent changes
to its fare structure was to reduce the need for constant sales to
attract passengers, and to dissuade travelers from always expecting a
fare sale around the corner.</TE>
<TE>   That appears to be happening, he said. Although Northwest and
other carriers still have short-term sales on certain routes--as the
declining average fare in May illustrates--the major airlines
together haven't had a full-blown nationwide fare sale for three
months, and that's "unheard of," Parsons said.</TE>

<HD>Reform of Options Has Costs, Benefits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the force of investor outrage, accounting regulation and possible
legislation in Congress changes the way corporations report the costs
of stock options, the result could be sharp declines in the stock
prices and earnings of hundreds of major companies.</LD>
<LD>   That's because those costs generally are not included in reported
earnings, on which stock prices are based. Earnings look higher than
they might otherwise be, helping to push stock prices up.</LD>
<LD>   This is not really a secret. Companies state the implied cost of
stock options in footnotes to their annual reports. Microsoft Corp.,
for example, where many employees have grown wealthy on stock options
gains, explains in its 2001 annual report that if it had charged an
expense for stock options, its reported earnings would have been 91
cents a share instead of $1.32.</LD>
<TE>   Likewise, Amgen Inc. explains that its earnings would have been 86
cents a share instead of $1.03; Northrop Grumman Corp. would have
reported $4.65 a share instead of $4.80.</TE>
<TE>   The difference was not the result of deception. There are many
reasons options costs haven't been included. But change is coming
because of abuses of the stock options system by many top corporate
executives.</TE>
<TE>   Reform should help remove distortions and give investors a clearer
picture of profits and companies' finances. But reform will carry
costs and unintentionally could be anti-entrepreneurial.</TE>
<TE>   Reported earnings for the firms in the Standard &amp; Poor's index of
the 500 major blue-chip companies could decline by 10% on average,
estimates a study by Merrill Lynch Global Research.</TE>
<TE>   Other consequences could crop up, such as a mad flurry of stock
buyback programs to offset the effect of officially counting more
shares in the calculation of earnings per share.</TE>
<TE>   Stock options for broad ranks of employees--a compensation
innovation that has grown in recent years--probably will be cut back.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies will have a disincentive to be generous with stock
options," says Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks), a certified public
accountant and a member of the House Banking and Financial Services
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Reform could increase the costs of setting up a business and could
slow the creation of innovative companies, says Brad Jones, founding
partner of Redpoint Ventures, a major backer of high-tech start-ups.</TE>
<TE>   The course of reform is far from certain, as public officials,
pension fund managers and members of Congress grapple with the need
to reform corporate practices and restore confidence in investment
markets.</TE>
<TE>   But stock options--which grant the right to buy company stock in
the future at a fixed price--are under fire partly because they were
the biggest source for the explosion in executive compensation in the
boom decade of the 1990s, when average pay soared to $15 million for
chief executives of big U.S. companies.</TE>
<TE>   Retired General Electric Co. Chairman Jack Welch has</TE>
<TE>   noted that objections to high front-office salaries in the 1980s
led</TE>
<TE>   executives such as himself to go for stock options--which made
them rich beyond their dreams when U.S. companies grew with the
global market and share</TE>
<TE>   prices rose in the stock market. In</TE>
<TE>   2000, his final full year at the helm, Welch's total compensation,</TE>
<TE>   which includes salary, bonus and</TE>
<TE>   stock options gains, was</TE>
<TE>   $136 million.</TE>
<TE>   Executive Payoffs</TE>
<TE>   But in the bust that has followed the boom, suspicion is arising
that such outsized rewards were not earned.</TE>
<TE>   "Some option plans were not incentives, but payoffs for executives
at the expense of shareholders," says Frank Glassner, head of
Compensation Design Group, a New York-based consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Glassner cites Tyson Foods Inc., which last year took hundreds of
thousands of options that had lost value and replaced them with
grants of stock to executives.</TE>
<TE>   The now-infamous Kenneth L. Lay, former chairman of Enron Corp.,
had loans from the company along with stock grants that he could use
to repay the loans, thereby lowering his tax liability and avoiding
requirements for reporting transactions to the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Such loans to executives may be prohibited in legislation the
Senate is likely to pass Monday. Of course, all company loans to
employees may be outlawed.</TE>
<TE>   "Major decisions on company practices are made because of abuses,
and good firms get hurt along with the bad," says Dan Marcus, head of
compensation at Mercer Human Resources Consulting in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The use of options has grown throughout corporate America and so
has the distortion of reported earnings. Mercer experts calculate
that if all the shares reserved for options were added to common
stock outstanding at the 350 largest firms, average earnings per
share could be reduced by almost 15%. That's about 50% more than the
effect would have been five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   And the effect could be much greater at high-tech firms, which
have used the incentive pay of stock options extensively. Cisco
Systems Inc., for example, could see earnings per share reduced by
67%, according to the Merrill Lynch study. Dell Computer Corp.'s
earnings could fall by 42%, those of Intel by 25% and earnings of
biotech firm Chiron Corp. by 23%.</TE>
<TE>   All the calculations assume no action such as stock buybacks would
be taken to offset the potential effect of calculating per-share
earnings on additional shares.</TE>
<TE>   The routine and extensive use of stock options by some of the most
innovative companies in the nation benefited the economy. The
incentives helped to build Microsoft, where the spectacle of
relatively young people retiring as "Microsoft millionaires" was a
mid-1990s advertisement for options. And options helped Microsoft
founder Bill Gates become the richest man in the world.</TE>
<TE>   The Value of Options</TE>
<TE>   "Company founders, by definition, always have stock at an initial
price," venture capitalist Jones points out. "The real value of stock
options is in their ability to attract those key personnel you need
to help develop the company. Options give them a chance for the big
score they cannot get at big companies," which can offer salary,
security and perks.</TE>
<TE>   But within the next several years, the cost of stock options
probably will be counted as an expense, as wages and salaries are
now. The International Accounting Standards Board, a global
professional body, is likely to recommend this fall that options be
expensed.</TE>
<TE>   Support for reform is growing.</TE>
<TE>   "I fear that the failure to expense stock option grants has
introduced a significant distortion in reported earnings," said
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan in a recent speech to
bankers.</TE>
<TE>   Distortions have grown along with the increased use of stock
options. For example, companies get tax deductions when employees
cash in stock options.</TE>
<TE>   "But huge tax deductions, with no expense on the other side of
that, doesn't make sense," says Peter G. Peterson, chairman of
investment firm Blackstone Group who is leading an effort by
high-level business people to reform accounting practices and other
aspects of the corporate system.</TE>
<TE>   So companies will have to change their accounting practices. But
use of stock options as incentives for all employees certainly can
continue.</TE>
<TE>   Many experts favor lengthening the duration of options, making
them exercisable only after a five-year wait instead of one year or
less, which is common. That way, corporate managers have to work for
the long-term development of the company, not merely for the earnings
of the next quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, reformers, members of Congress, company executives
and their employees should keep in mind that the purpose of
compensation is to "create value," says consultant Marcus.</TE>
<TE>   They might look at solid companies such as Worthington Industries
Inc., a specialty steel producer based in Columbus, Ohio. Worthington
has had profit-sharing plans for all its employees since it opened
its doors in 1955. Through a system of incentives and targets, an
employee can add one-third or more to base pay.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which has grown to $1.7 billion in annual sales and
6,800 employees, is continually successful in a tough business.</TE>
<TE>   May the reforms to come produce many more like it.</TE>

<HD>Costs of New War Not Revealed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the past, major wars involved substantial government regulation of
business and intrusion into the lives of citizens. As James Flanigan
points out ["Homeland Security--a Burden and a Boon, July 7],
individual businesses may benefit and the economy may be stimulated.
But the primary effects of war--including the new war on
terrorism--are cost, inconvenience and sacrifice.</LD>
<LD>   Although past wars were primarily fought on foreign soil, the war
on terrorism is largely going to take place at home. Airline travel
will become more expensive and more of a hassle. To keep weapons of
mass destruction from entering the country, ships and trucks will
have to be inspected. International trade will be impeded and imports
will be more expensive. Many private businesses will have to enhance
security at costs that will be passed to consumers. Some businesses
will not carry out their responsibilities and will have to be ordered
to do so by government.</LD>
<LD>   Government agents will have to see that those orders are carried
out. State and local expenditures on public health will have to
increase to deal with anthrax-type attacks. Taxes will have to be
raised to pay for those efforts. And because the war on terrorism
will not end with some general signing a surrender agreement, all of
these costs will go on indefinitely.</LD>
<TE>   Is anyone in the federal government, from the president on down,
leveling with the American people about the economic and personal
implications of the war on terrorism? I don't think so.</TE>

<TE>   Fewer Cell Phones Could Be a Good Thing</TE>
<TE>   Re: "FCC Steps Up Airwave Hunt," July 5: So there might not be
enough bandwidth for cell phones and the industry might suffer a
financial downfall. Gosh, whatever will we do? I say it can't happen
soon enough.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine, drivers who pay attention. And the sweet sound of Muzak
in your ear at the grocery store, instead of someone's date details
or dinner menu. I say let the industry collapse, and let's return to
civility. The telecommunications industry needs to pay a price for
its unbridled greed. Besides, society is not going to crash and burn
without cell phones.</TE>
<TE>   As for your figure that the 50% of those without the devices are
elderly, poor or children who cannot afford them, that is laughable.
Did it occur to you that millions of normal Americans do not worship
at the trough of technology and simply do not need electronic gadgets
to feel "connected" to the world or to impress everyone? The
high-tech hucksters need to realize that we aren't all idiots willing
to throw our hard-earned money at these dubious and dastardly
devices, which with few exceptions represent no more than convenience
and instant gratification masquerading as necessity.</TE>

<TE>   Ford's Crown Victoria Response Surprising</TE>
<TE>   If your articles on Ford's Crown Victoria's cars ["Recall Pressure
Rises Against Ford," June 22] were meant as a general public
announcement, they certainly were a wake-up call for myself.</TE>
<TE>   I'm overwhelmed by the arrogance of Ford Motor Co.'s response to
the dangers in these cars. They reluctantly agreed "to investigate"
the gas-tank explosion in police cars and "might" do some corrective
measure but would not do anything to the civilian version of the same
cars because civilians don't have the frequency of rear-end
collisions as police cars. How is that for integrity and ethics?</TE>
<TE>   This company, still run by Ford family members, apparently learned
nothing from the Firestone dangers and less from the present
corporate greed we are experiencing in America. There is no Ford in
my future because there might not be any future if I were in a Ford.</TE>

<TE>   Story a Misleading View</TE>
<TE>   of Oracle's Outlook</TE>
<TE>   Joe Menn's "Competition, Slumping Sales Cloud Oracle's Outlook,"
[June 23] mentions the departure of Larry Ellison's deputies, "from
Oracle co-founder Bob Miner to Ray Lane, all of whom have left the
company."</TE>
<TE>   Ray Lane did leave Oracle two years ago. Bob Miner was still on
the company payroll when he died of cancer in November 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Menn seems far more concerned with reinforcing media-fed
stereotypes about Ellison's personal life and wealth than with
presenting a thoughtful or even accurate depiction of Oracle's
business.</TE>
<TE>   His misleading synopsis of Oracle's current business and growth
potential completely ignores the hard data we provided him on these
specific areas, and he clearly made no effort to present a fair or
balanced perspective from our customer and analyst communities.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the L.A. Times' extensive coverage of the issues with the
state of California, Menn presents a simplistic and one-sided view of
this complex situation, neglecting to even mention the multiple
independent audit reports that consistently highlight the benefits
California taxpayers could realize from this deal.</TE>

<HD>See How Far Retirement Funds Go Before Paying Off Mortgage</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I am 63 and my husband is 67. When we retire, we will have
about $300,000 in my 401(k) account. In addition, we have about
$110,000 in various mutual funds. Our Social Security income will be
about $2,200 a month. Should we take some of the money in our mutual
funds to pay off our $85,000 mortgage balance or continue making
mortgage payments to retain the tax deductions?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: It's a lovely thing to be mortgage-free by the time you
retire. Many people decide to accelerate their mortgage payments as
they near their 60s so that they can reduce their monthly expenses in
retirement and have the security of a paid-for home.</LD>
<LD>   Whether you should tap about 20% of your retirement funds to do so
is another story.</LD>
<TE>   How much money you have in retirement matters less than how much
you spend. If your post-retirement expenses, without the mortgage,
are entirely covered by Social Security, then you may want to pay off
that mortgage. In the long run, your mutual fund investments might
earn more, but you might prefer the security of not having to worry
about monthly mortgage payments.</TE>
<TE>   If your expenses are substantially higher, however, you may want
to leave your investments alone. You could spend 20 or more years in
retirement, and your money may not go as far as you think.</TE>
<TE>   If you want an illustration of how long your nest egg might last,
check out the retirement income calculator at www.troweprice.com
/ric. It will show you that if you want to be certain of not running
out of money during a 20-year retirement, you can take $1,517 a month
from your $410,000 kitty, assuming it's invested in a diversified mix
of stocks, bonds and cash. If you reduce your nest egg to pay off the
mortgage, you'll be able to withdraw just $877 a month. If you want
to make your retirement money stretch for 30 years, you'll have to
take out even less.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of tax benefits is secondary at best. If you're in the
27% federal bracket, for example, you're getting only 27 cents of tax
benefit for every dollar you spend on mortgage interest. It doesn't
make much sense to spend a buck to get a quarter or so back from the
government, does it?</TE>
<TE>   Do Research Before Investing in an Annuity</TE>
<TE>   Q: My tax advisor said annuities are one of the best
investments for a person near retirement. I am 57 and fully vested in
a government retirement pension plan that will give me a generous
monthly check in retirement. I also invest in a government thrift
savings account and contribute the maximum to Roth IRAs each year. I
still have some extra cash to invest after all this. I have no
children and plenty of insurance. My friends suggest I simply spend
more. What advice do you have for me?</TE>
<TE>   A: Does your tax advisor sell annuities, by any chance?</TE>
<TE>   Annuities can be a decent fit for some people, but they have some
significant disadvantages as well. You'll definitely want an
objective evaluation of your financial situation before you invest in
one.</TE>
<TE>   It's probably time for you to chat with a qualified financial
planner to see whether your pension and current investments are
enough to ensure you a comfortable retirement.</TE>
<TE>   If on review you find that your pension and current savings will
provide more than enough for you to live on in retirement--and that's
possible, given how generous some government pensions can be--then
you might want to take your friends' advice and start spending a
little more of your hard-earned cash now. You also could consider
paying down your mortgage, building your emergency fund or buying
long-term-care insurance with the extra cash.</TE>
<TE>   If you do decide to invest more and you're already
contributing the maximum to all available retirement accounts, you
should carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages before
investing in an annuity.</TE>
<TE>   There are several types, and it's not clear which kind your tax
advisor was suggesting. The most common is a variable deferred
annuity. Like other annuities, variable annuities don't give you an
upfront tax break, but your earnings grow tax deferred. The downside
is that those earnings are taxed as income when you withdraw the
money. If you invest directly in stocks or mutual funds instead, your
earnings could qualify for lower capital gains tax rates, especially
if you're a steady buy-and-holder.</TE>
<TE>   If you mess with your investments a lot, however, variable
annuities might be a good fit. Frequent traders can incur big tax
bills when their funds aren't held in a tax-deferred account, so if
you're one of those who like to constantly fine-tune his account, you
might find more tax protection in an annuity.</TE>
<TE>   Variable annuities have some disadvantages in estate planning,
although this may not matter as much to you, because you don't have
kids who are likely to inherit this money. The investments inside
annuities don't get the favorable tax treatment, known as a step-up
in basis, on your death that comparable mutual fund or stock
investments would receive.</TE>
<TE>   Variable annuities also typically have higher costs
than comparable mutual funds, and you would need to hold this
investment for anywhere from seven to 20 years for the tax benefit to
outweigh the extra costs. Typically when variable annuities are
recommended, they're aimed at younger working folks, not those near
retirement who may need the money soon.</TE>
<TE>   Your tax advisor might have been talking about a different kind of
an annuity--one that's designed not for building retirement savings
but for paying a guaranteed stream of income during retirement, a
stream that typically ends at your death. These are known as
immediate annuities and can make sense for people who don't have a
substantial guaranteed income during retirement. You do, however,
through your pension, so an immediate annuity might not be the best
fit either.</TE>
<TE>   You can learn more about annuities in the insurance tutorials at
www.latimes.com/money. If you do decide to invest in an annuity,
check out the lower-cost offerings at Vanguard, Fidelity and T. Rowe
Price.</TE>

<HD>Exec Pay Becoming an Issue for Investors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A growing number of mutual fund managers are taking executive pay
policies into account when deciding where to invest, according to a
new survey. It may be high time that individual investors do the
same, industry experts say.</LD>
<LD>   "Outlandish compensation should be a compelling warning sign for
any investor," said Nell Minow, editor of the Corporate Library, a
Web site that focuses on corporate governance issues. "It is a
symptom of a bad board" of directors.</LD>
<LD>   "People used to call these issues a 'distraction,' " she said.
"Now they're realizing that they're core to the investment."</LD>
<TE>   With questionable executive pay practices featured prominently in
recent scandals at Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc. and Global Crossing
Ltd.--to name just a few--a sampling of opinion among mutual fund
managers indicates that they are beginning to see Minow's point.</TE>
<TE>   Ninety percent of the 33 fund managers surveyed recently said they
are using corporate pay practices "at least some of the time" as one
of the factors they consider when making investment decisions,
according to Pearl Meyer &amp; Partners, the New York-based compensation
consulting firm the survey.</TE>
<TE>   That's a dramatic increase from the firm's last such survey,
conducted four years ago, when 58% of the fund managers questioned
took pay into account when making investment decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, in 1998 only 30% of fund managers thought chief
executive pay was excessive, compared with 70% today.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors are scrutinizing executive pay and corporate oversight
as never before," said Steven E. Hall, managing director of Pearl
Meyer. "While our survey isn't conclusive, it indicates that funds
want directors to focus more closely on their companies' executive
compensation programs and their effect on shareholder interests."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, lawmakers and securities regulators already are
debating reforms aimed at improving oversight of compensation
policies by boards of directors. And a group of institutional
investors that includes such fund industry icons as Jack Bogle of
Vanguard Group and Bill Miller of Legg Mason Inc. launched a movement
in April aimed at boosting corporate managers' accountability to
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, individual investors may want to watch pay
practices themselves, recognizing that it provides a fairly obvious
clue that management has gone awry.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Minow said, an investor who watches pay closely
might have sold Global Crossing shares when the stock was selling in
the $50 range. That was when the company revealed that it had granted
2 million stock options at a $10-per-share discount to market value
to short-time CEO Robert Annunziata. That guaranteed Annunziata a
$20-million payment for doing no more than standing still.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that they were going to give him such an absurd payment
showed that the board had absolutely no power to say no to him,"
Minow said. "He could have said, 'I want you to turn me green,' and
they would have said, 'Sure. We'll get some paint.' "</TE>
<TE>   Ranking by CEO Pay</TE>
<TE>   Although hindsight helps make agreements such as Global Crossing's
appear both obvious and egregious, it's tougher to spot the
transgressions early, said Amy Domini, who manages socially screened
mutual funds at Domini Investments in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Domini screens companies for pay practices by figuring out where a
chief executive ranks among his or her peers. In the past, she
considered it a warning sign if a company's CEO was among the 10%
most highly paid. Now, her threshold is lower--she kicks out the 15%
most highly paid.</TE>
<TE>   But even that may be insufficient in this era of rapid pay
increases and extreme excesses, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been difficult to screen because the numbers kept rising so
dramatically each year," Domini said.</TE>
<TE>   Domini also looks at how directors are paid, because an overpaid
director probably is reluctant to shake things up, she said.</TE>
<TE>   'No Raw Number'</TE>
<TE>   Still, few experts have simple strategies for deciding when pay is
out of line.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no raw number that you can say is simply too much,"
Minow said. "But there needs to be true pay for performance."</TE>
<TE>   A few yardsticks: If executive pay doesn't fall when company
earnings are down, if managers are paid hundreds of millions to
perform no better than their peers, if the top five executives are
taking home a substantial chunk of the earnings of the entire
company--all of these are indications that something may be wrong,
Minow said.</TE>
<TE>   When those warnings are present, shareholders must take an active
role by voting against directors who have approved the deals--the
members of the board's compensation committee, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "People feel helpless," Domini said. "They think they're just too
small to make a difference. But there's an old Ethiopian proverb that
says, 'When spider webs unite, they tie down the lion.' There has
never been an important social change without grass-roots support."</TE>

<HD>Protests Stymie Peru's Drive to Raise Capital</HD>
<DH>As in other Latin nations, rising opposition to
privatization is halting projects that could bring foreign funds and
create jobs</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICLAYO, Peru</DL>
<LD>A $100-million sugar project on an abandoned stretch of
government-owned desert offers what this country's ailing economy
needs: jobs, tax revenue and a likely end to importation of 30% of
the sugar it consumes.</LD>
<LD>   But the developer has been forced to put the project on hold after
a rising tide of citizen opposition to government efforts to sell
assets to the private sector soured the investment climate.</LD>
<LD>   The same resistance to privatization, often violent, is flaring
across South America, fueling street protests in Argentina and the
surprisingly strong presidential bids of leftist candidates in Brazil
and Bolivia.</LD>
<TE>   Citizen resentment is perhaps most visible in Peru, where a recent
poll by Apoyo, a Lima consulting firm, showed 70% of those questioned
were opposed to privatization. Last month, riots in Arequipa that
left two dead forced the government to suspend the sale of two
regional power utilities to Brussels-based Tractabel for $167
million.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, rice farmers opposed to a 14,000-acre resort near the
northern city of Tumbes blocked traffic on the Pan American Highway
for two days, paralyzing the region. Sugar farmers opposed to
privatizing their cooperative near Trujillo also protested, as did
woodcutters in the Amazon who demonstrated against granting timber
licenses to big companies.</TE>
<TE>   The nervous government has suspended several major privatization
plans, causing doubts in the investment community and uncertainty
about the future of government auctions of assets ranging from power
transmission lines to ports totaling about $3.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't go forward until the situation stabilizes," said Rex
Canon, president and chief executive of Maple Cos. and the company's
top executive in Peru. In 1998, his company, which has been operating
in Peru for 10 years, fired up a electric power plant near Pucallpa
that supplies 5% of the country's electricity.</TE>
<TE>   There have been no public demonstrations against Maple's project,
which calls for developing a desolate tract of land the company won
through a bid. The project would include 15,000 acres of sugar cane
fields, a sugar mill with a small power plant and a five-mile canal
to bring water from a nearby reservoir.</TE>
<TE>   But the demonstrations have made Wall Street nervous, driving up
interest rates on Peruvian debt and increasing the cost of financing
that developers such as Maple Cos. of Dallas need to get projects
built. As a cautionary measure, the firm has downscaled the sugar
project to reduce or eliminate the need for outside financing.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-privatization rage is not how Latin America's development
script was supposed to read. It was an article of faith of the
so-called Washington Consensus that Latin American countries would
gain a path to prosperity and modernization by selling inefficiently
run state assets and services to private companies.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, privatization has triggered anger because benefits have
failed to work their way to the people. After 15 years of asset
sales, many citizens equate them with massive layoffs and, in some
cases, higher rates for basic services. The continent is as far away
from prosperity and First World status as it was before privatization
began, according to several studies.</TE>
<TE>   Peru, for example, is suffering through a four-year recession, and
poverty and joblessness have been increasing since the early 1990s.
During that time, the government has sold about $9 billion in
state-owned assets and services, from telephone companies to power
utilities. Unemployment is 15% and rising.</TE>
<TE>   "The feeling is that the government has sold off grandmother's
jewels, and that people are left with neither the jewels nor
grandmother," said political analyst Julio Cotler of the Institute of
Peruvian Studies, a Lima-based think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition to privatization began building under the authoritarian
regime of President Alberto Fujimori, who was in power from 1990 to
2000. Outrage emerged after it was revealed that his disgraced and
imprisoned advisor, Vladimiro Montesinos, siphoned off $115 million
in privatization proceeds. (About $75 million has been recovered.)</TE>
<TE>   "The image privatizations have here is totally negative, a synonym
for cronyism and corruption," Cotler said.</TE>
<TE>   The recent democratization process under President Alejandro
Toledo has given Peruvians more freedom to vent their frustrations.</TE>
<TE>   Displeased Citizens</TE>
<TE>   Although people questioned in recent polls by Apoyo said basic
services have improved, they nevertheless use privatization as a
focus for their dissatisfaction with the government, Apoyo chief
economist Hugo San Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   "Without a giant economic boom, people will not recover their
optimism about privatizations," San Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   Many blame political missteps by Toledo for the recent turmoil. He
decided to go ahead with the privatization in Arequipa even though he
had promised the citizens of Peru's second-largest city during his
campaign that the power companies were "untouchable regional
patrimony."</TE>
<TE>   "We had a popular rebellion here, because people hadn't forgotten
his promises," Arequipa Mayor Juan Manuel Guillen said. "Those
promises were one reason the province voted 70% for Toledo."</TE>
<TE>   The riots in Arequipa surprised the government, created the
biggest crisis in Toledo's presidency and revealed the depth of
opposition to the sell-offs.</TE>
<TE>   "A privatization is no guarantee of development," Guillen said. "I
am not opposed to foreign investment. But we have a totally empty
industrial park here--why not invest in a company and put it there,
not sell a utility that is running well?"</TE>
<TE>   The government often has acted without bothering to sell the
populace on the benefits of privatization, said Shane Hunt, professor
emeritus of economics at Boston University and former advisor to the
Peruvian government.</TE>
<TE>   "Throughout the 1990s in Peru, there was essentially no debate on
economic policy. The state was so discredited as an economic actor
that the advocates of liberalization and privatization had their way
without opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, this gave them the habit of running policy
initiatives past Washington but not past the Peruvian people," Hunt
said.</TE>
<TE>   Need for Investment</TE>
<TE>   Suspension of the sales comes at a difficult time for Peru, which
was counting on $3.5 billion in proceeds from the privatization and
business concessions to help balance huge budget deficits over the
next two years, said Ricardo Vega Llona, head of Proinversion, the
government agency in charge of the sales. But, Vega Llona said, the
cash proceeds are of secondary importance.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important goal of the privatizations is not a fiscal one
but to remove the state from the production of goods and services and
put it in the hands of the citizens," Vega Llona said.</TE>
<TE>   Long term, the need for foreign investment is just as critical.
Peru needs huge amounts of capital if it is to generate jobs and
reduce the grinding poverty in which half its citizens live, Apoyo's
San Martin said. The nation has been unable to create 800,000 jobs
needed for youths entering the labor market since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Because Peru doesn't have enough investment capital, it must seek
it elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "We need an external source of capital, and privatizations are
that source," said Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, Peru's minister of economy
and finance and a former Wall Street investment banker, who vowed
that the privatization process would continue.</TE>
<TE>   Kuczynski said the government will launch an effort late this
month, after a Cabinet reshuffling is complete, to convince the
country that its policy of seeking foreign investment is correct. As
part of the shake-up, he reportedly plans to resign.</TE>
<TE>   The future of Peru's privatization and its economy may depend on
how well the Toledo administration does its selling job.</TE>
<TE>   "Privatization started off being a pragmatic reaction to obvious
failures of state management, but it seems to have wound up as an
ideological mud fight," Hunt of Boston University said.</TE>
<TE>   Investors in the Middle</TE>
<TE>   Caught in the middle of the fight are investors such as Canon. His
project would be the first sugar mill built in Peru since the 1950s,
and the largest investment in the industry since Peru's socialist
leaders nationalized it in 1969 and put most plantations into 12 huge
worker-controlled cooperatives.</TE>
<TE>   Once among the highest yielding in the world, Peru's sugar
industry is producing half the annual output of 1.5 million tons it
did in 1969. The cooperatives are highly inefficient, subsidized
producers and don't have the money to invest in new technology. The
government is trying to get out from under the subsidies by selling
the cooperatives to private investors.</TE>
<TE>   Maple's mill, using modern technology, would be the lowest-cost
producer of sugar in Peru, Canon said. It would produce 150,000 tons
of sugar annually to start and eventually eliminating the country's
need for imports. Built from scratch, it would create 400 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   But even if it goes forward, the project, called Agricola Cerro
Prieto, will be scaled down. The planned initial output is 25% less
than first envisioned. The plan included a 30-megawatt power plant
fueled solely by sugar refuse, with excess power sold into the local
electricity grid. The revised version of the plant will produce only
enough power for the mill's use.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still hopeful the project will go ahead and that by the
time we're ready to start construction early next year, the political
situation will have settled down," Canon said. "But the climate is
more difficult."</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>White House, Capitol Hill Take Aim at Fraud</LD>
<LD>   Washington turned its attention to Wall Street, starting at the
top with President Bush proposing longer prison sentences for
executives convicted of fraud and establishing a task force to police
corporate wrongdoing.</LD>
<LD>   The heads of the new task force, Deputy Atty. Gen. Larry Thompson
and Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission who has been criticized for being too cozy with the
industry he regulates, pledged to aggressively pursue white-collar
criminals.</LD>
<TE>   They might be helped by new legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate swiftly and unanimously voted to ban corporate loans to
insiders by making it illegal, one of a series of amendments
strengthening an accounting reform bill that is expected to be
approved Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would have to be reconciled with a House version that
Democrats say doesn't go far enough.</TE>
<TE>   The corporate loan issue put the White House on the defensive
because Bush received low-interest loans from a Texas oil company
while serving on its board of directors in the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom Ex-CFO Says Ebbers Knew of Scheme</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom Inc.'s former chief financial officer, who is at the
heart of the company's accounting scandal, has told attorneys that
ousted Chairman Bernard J. Ebbers knew about the accounting scheme
that allowed the long-distance telephone giant to hide losses
totaling $1.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The attorneys relayed the information to a House committee.</TE>
<TE>   Scott D. Sullivan, who last month was fired as WorldCom's top
finance executive, said Ebbers was aware that hundreds of millions of
dollars had been moved into capital expenditure accounts to make the
company look stronger than it was.</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers denied Sullivan's accusations.</TE>
<TE>   Both Ebbers and Sullivan refused to testify as a congressional
committee assailed the telephone company for hiding $3.9 billion in
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Perot Denies Firm Used Inside Knowledge</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento, billionaire Texan H. Ross Perot defended his
company against charges that it tried to profit from inside knowledge
of California's electricity market.</TE>
<TE>   His testimony came as the state faced soaring temperatures and
another energy crunch that prompted federal regulators to step in and
allow power generators to raise short-term prices this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Perot told a state Senate committee that Perot Systems Corp.
offered to teach energy companies how to take advantage of loopholes
in California's deregulated market but did nothing wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Halt of Clinical Trial</TE>
<TE>   Hurts Drug Industry</TE>
<TE>   The pharmaceutical industry was delivered a blow when a major
clinical trial of the effects of hormone replacement therapy for
women was halted. The trial, the most exhaustive study of hormone
therapy combining estrogen and progestin, found increased risks of
dangerous side effects in menopausal women taking the drug Prempro
made by Wyeth Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Investors fled stocks of Wyeth and other companies with HRT
products on the market. The company sold $2.2 billion in HRT products
in the 12 months ended March 31. Wyeth stock closed Friday at $38.50,
down 22% over a five-day period.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Wyeth was slapped with a lawsuit that seeks
class-action status on behalf of women taking Prempro.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, drug giant Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. is under scrutiny
by the Securities and Exchange Commission over its aggressive sales
incentives that bolstered revenue by $1 billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   State Unemployment Rate Unchanged</TE>
<TE>   California's labor market continued to tread water in June, with
the unemployment rate unchanged at 6.4% and companies reluctant to do
much hiring, according to data from the state Economic Development
Department.</TE>
<TE>   California employers boosted payrolls by only 4,400 jobs last
month, underscoring their skepticism about the strength of the
economic recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Other economic data showed that consumers are having doubts about
the economy's strength. The University of Michigan index of consumer
confidence fell to 86.5 in July, down from 92.4 in June and 96.9 in
May.</TE>
<TE>   Yahoo Posts Slim</TE>
<TE>   Second-Quarter Profit</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting a slow and steady shift amid the rubble of the dot-com
collapse, Yahoo Inc. posted a slim profit after six consecutive
quarters of losses.</TE>
<TE>   The turnaround validates moves made by Chief Executive Terry
Semel, who has struggled to reduce the Internet portal's reliance on
advertising and to implement fees for many of the site's most popular
services. Analysts said Yahoo had navigated the worst of a disastrous
period and that the Internet economy appeared to be rebounding,
albeit slowly.</TE>
<TE>   Yahoo reported second-quarter net income of $21.4 million, or 3
cents a share, contrasted with a loss of $48.5 million, or 9 cents a
share, in the year-earlier period. The company said revenue rose to
$225.8 million from $182.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jackson Accuses</TE>
<TE>   Sony Music of Cheating</TE>
<TE>   Pop star Michael Jackson has taken off the glove.</TE>
<TE>   The best-paid recording artist in the business has pitted himself
against the chairman of Sony Music Entertainment Inc., Thomas D.
Mottola, blaming the music executive for his latest CD's poor sales
and accusing the company of cheating artists, particularly blacks,
out of royalty payments.</TE>
<TE>   Mottola has declined to comment, and Sony called Jackson's
statements "bizarre" and "false."</TE>
<TE>   Record company executives and others have suggested that the King
of Pop might be an emperor with no clothes, capitalizing on the
artist rights movement to pressure Sony into breaking its contract so
he can leave with his valuable catalog of master recordings.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Faces Probe</TE>
<TE>   by French Regulators</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Universal  took a crucial first step toward averting a
financial collapse by securing a key deal with its lenders, but the
French entertainment giant now faces an investigation into how it has
disclosed its complex finances.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation, which centers on whether the company disclosed
its liquidity crisis in a timely fashion, will complicate efforts by
new Chief Executive Jean-Rene Fourtou to restore investor confidence
. The company's stock value has fallen about 70% this year.</TE>
<TE>   The cause and scope of the investigation are unclear, but among
the key questions investigators are expected to ask are when did the
company become aware it faced a liquidity problem and how soon did it
convey that to investors, said a source familiar with the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which owns Universal Studios, was close to securing a
$2-billion loan from its banks.</TE>
<TE>   EBay Agrees to Buy</TE>
<TE>   PayPal for $1.5 Billion</TE>
<TE>   EBay Inc. widened its rule over the Internet auction world with an
agreement to acquire online payment service PayPal Inc. in a
$1.5-billion stock swap reminiscent of the dot-com boom.</TE>
<TE>   EBay has been profitable every quarter since going public in
September 1998, and it expects a second-quarter profit of 19 cents a
share.</TE>
<TE>   EBay transactions already account for about 60% of PayPal's
business.</TE>
<TE>   Honda Plans to Expand</TE>
<TE>   N. American Production</TE>
<TE>   Showing strong faith in both an improving U.S. economy and a
new-car market that can sustain annual sales of 16 million to 17
million units, American Honda Motor Co. said it would spend nearly
half a billion dollars over the next 30 months to boost annual North
American production by 180,000 vehicles, a 15% jump.</TE>
<TE>   The move is the latest in a string of new factories or plant
expansions announced by import car makers for their North American
operations in recent months--an expansion occurring at the same time
domestic car makers are closing some of plants and lowering
production capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing Plans to Merge</TE>
<TE>   Space, Defense Units</TE>
<TE>   Boeing Co. is merging its Seal Beach-based space and
communications unit with its military aircraft and missile systems
business headquartered in St. Louis, a move that will allow the
company to pursue a bigger chunk of the growing defense budget.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing said it will combine the two units into a $23-billion
business that will place all of its defense-related work under one
roof. The combined unit, Integrated Defense Systems, will be
headquartered in St. Louis and led by James F. Albaugh, president and
chief executive of the space and communications unit.</TE>
<TE>   Because the changes are mainly administrative, no jobs or
facilities are affected. Chicago-based Boeing is the largest private
employer in Southern California, with about 35,000 employees.</TE>

<HD>Senior-Care Franchises Find Healthy Market</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to find green in the graying of America, hundreds of
entrepreneurs are opening franchises aimed at helping the nation's
seniors handle everything from household chores to their afternoon
recreation.</LD>
<LD>   Known as in-home, nonmedical senior care, companies such as Home
Instead Senior Care and Comfort Keepers are among at least eight
franchisers making inroads in a rapidly growing market long dominated
by thousands of mom-and-pop providers.</LD>
<LD>   Fueled by demographics and aggressive marketing, the number of
franchised senior-care outlets has grown from fewer than 100 in 1996
to more than 900, with most of the growth coming in the last three
years, experts said.</LD>
<TE>   "The growth is clearly explosive, and we're seeing it nationwide,"
said Elisabeth Bryenton, president and chief executive of Ohio-based
Child &amp; Elder Care Insights, an employer-sponsored search service.</TE>
<TE>   Martin McDermott, vice president of marketing for
FranchiseAmerica.com, an online franchising marketplace, said
nonmedical senior care "seems to be among the fastest-growing markets
right now."</TE>
<TE>   The International Franchise Assn. does not keep figures on growth
rates for different industries, but Entrepreneur magazine listed
Ohio-based Home Helpers in its top 10 list of new franchise companies
for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the franchise, services offered by nonmedical-care
providers can include housekeeping, meal preparation, transportation,
or even watching movies and playing cards with a client.</TE>
<TE>   Because of licensing requirements, most of the nonmedical services
do not offer hands-on care such as bathing. And although caregivers
can remind a client to take medications, they are not allowed to
administer drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Client fees range from $12 to $20 an hour, depending on the
company, market and services rendered.</TE>
<TE>   Though food-related franchises are the most popular in the United
States, franchising and elder-care experts say in-home care rapidly
is gaining favor among entrepreneurs because of the growing numbers
of elderly Americans and the relatively low cost of starting a
senior-care business.</TE>
<TE>   Entrepreneurs often can launch a franchised nonmedical service to
aid seniors for less than $50,000, operators said. And--unlike child
care--no license is required in most states.</TE>
<TE>   "You wouldn't require nearly as much capital to get started as you
would for any franchise with a huge brand name or that is equipment
intensive," said Robert O'Toole, president of Informed Elder Care
Consulting, a Massachusetts-based service.</TE>
<TE>   Josie Aguilera opened the Covina office of Home Instead in early
1998. It's one of 340 offices in the company, which is one of the
largest franchisers in the field.</TE>
<TE>   With her background in human resources, Aguilera believed that a
business involving managing people played to her strengths, and she
found opening a senior-care franchise "more affordable than trying to
purchase a McDonalds."</TE>
<TE>   Increasing Revenue</TE>
<TE>   Aguilera, whose east Los Angeles County territory includes about
54,000 residents older than 65, said her business had revenue of
$300,000 in her first full year of operation with about 30 clients.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, with about 40 clients, including several seeking
live-in care, and 40 to 60 caregivers (mostly women, some of whom
worked as little as three hours a day), revenue rose to about
$500,000, about half of which goes to payroll.</TE>
<TE>   Other major costs for Aguilera include workers' compensation and
liability insurance for the caregivers, who are treated as employees.</TE>
<TE>   Franchisees with some firms--including Griswold Special Care in
Erdenheim, Pa., and Visiting Angels in Havertown, Pa.--reduce costs
by treating some caregivers as independent contractors rather than
employees. Those franchisees don't have to pay workers' compensation
or unemployment insurance and can thereby offer clients lower prices.</TE>
<TE>   But Kent Griswold, president of Griswold Special Care, said that
in some cases, the state or the Internal Revenue Service could
determine that a caregiver is an employee, making the franchisee
potentially liable for back taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Franchising fees for senior care usually are $12,000 to $24,000.
For auto, lodging or retail-related franchises, the average franchise
fee can easily exceed $40,000, according to the International
Franchise Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Royalties--the yearly rebates paid to the corporate office for a
franchise--range from 2.5% to 5%. That's comparable to the royalties
charged for hotel and motel franchises, but substantially less than
the typical fees for an auto repair franchise, which is 6.5% to 7.5%.</TE>
<TE>   In return, senior-care franchise operators get rights to an
exclusive territory or population group, support services such as
payroll and scheduling, training and marketing materials.</TE>
<TE>   Aguilera believes the guidance, training and support services she
gets from Home Instead is well worth the franchise costs she pays.</TE>
<TE>   But entrepreneurs who already have a foothold in their community
and the expertise in running a business might just as easily operate
as an independent, said Kay Marie Ainsley, managing director of
Michael H. Seid &amp; Associates, a Connecticut-based consulting service</TE>
<TE>   "Given the fee structure [of franchising], you may be able to make
more money on your own," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But she and others added that as consumers begin choosing among
the growing number of service providers, brand recognition could
become an important factor.</TE>
<TE>   With an estimated 6,000 companies nationwide providing in-home
nonmedical senior care, franchised outlets remain a small part of the
business--numerically. But franchisers, who grossed more than $250
million in sales last year, said they are gaining the upper hand
because most of the independents are very small.</TE>
<TE>   Independents See Effects</TE>
<TE>   "When we go into a market and talk with the referral sources, it's
rare that the names of the independents are mentioned," said Jerry
Clum, who founded Comfort Keepers with his wife, Kristina, in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Some independents said the arrival of the franchisers has hurt
their bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   Laurie Reid, manager of Riverside's independent Home Care &amp; Home
Helpers, has seen a dramatic drop in the number of referrals from
hospitals since the franchisees moved into town.</TE>
<TE>   "About three years ago, I started to notice it," said Reid, who
employs about 30 caregivers. "The hospitals used to refer to us
patients being released. They no longer do. We used to get at least
five referrals monthly. Now we don't get any.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way we get referrals now is by word of mouth," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Because referrals have slacked off, Reid said, franchisers
increasingly have pressed her to join a chain. But she likes the
control inherent in being independent.</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining control and not wanting to pay the franchise fees were
listed as main reasons by many for remaining independent.</TE>
<TE>   To help independents compete, Steve Everhart launched Senior's
Choice, a Capistrano Beach-based network of independent operators.
For a one-time fee of $10,000 and annual membership dues of $3,000,
operators can gain access to training and cut-rate insurance without
the restrictions of being a franchise.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way you should go it alone in this industry," Everhart
said. "You don't have to reinvent the wheel."</TE>
<TE>   Still, growing numbers of entrepreneurs are seeking the name
recognition that franchises offer.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew LaBrada, owner of a 2-year-old Comfort Keepers franchise in
La Mirada, thought about "just hanging out a shingle" rather than
launching a franchise. The offer of corporate support changed his
mind.</TE>
<TE>   Although LaBrada has seen increased competition from rival
franchises and independents, he's not concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "Even as we speak, there's plenty of work for everyone," said
LaBrada, who employs about 35 caregivers. "And in the next few years,
there's going to be exponential growth."</TE>

<LD>In his July 10 news analysis of President Bush's speech before Wall
Street, Ronald Brownstein describes Bush's "skepticism about the
ability of Washington regulation to solve social problems." The
recent corporate crime wave could be considered a "social problem"
only if one also puts bank robbery in that category. Even if we are
to accept Brownstein's interpretation (I tend to think that the
president is reluctant to bite the hand that feeds him), Bush has
proven himself to be more than willing to use the federal
government's might to address the "social problem" of drug abuse.</LD>

<TE>   "New Woes May Need New Fixes" (July 9) promotes as a remedy the
very theory that caused the current financial crisis: that the "new"
economy requires new rules. To the contrary, the new economy requires
the rigorous application of the old rules, such as don't lie about
your finances. Although Enron's method was convoluted, its fraud of
inflating revenue and earnings and hiding debt was not.</TE>
<TE>   The same is true of the various Internet darlings that reported
phantom earnings derived from swapping worthless advertising space.
Similarly, there's hardly anything "new economy" about WorldCom
boosting its earnings by claiming that current expenses were actually
capital expenditures. If CEOs, CFOs, auditors and directors had
simply followed the old rules of doing their jobs honestly and with
integrity, none of this would have happened. In fact, following the
old rules of judging a company by its actual revenue and earnings,
rather than wildly optimistic dreams of technological growth,
probably would have prevented the tech bubble and its burst in the
first place.</TE>

<TE>   "Do the Math: It Adds Up to Investor Greed" (Commentary, July 9),
James Pinkerton's blanket chiding of Enron investors as greedy, is
foolishly simplistic. While the label may apply to some or even many,
there are many more who were unwitting victims through mutual fund
purchases or individual purchases made on the recommendation of
advisors they trusted and respected.</TE>
<TE>   Pinkerton also fails to address the many whose 401(k) plans were
wiped out after they were reassured there was no reason to worry. To
call all of these people bubbleheads and fools is demeaning, at best.
Efforts to place the onus on people other than the managers and
auditors are almost as criminal as the actions of the corporate
managers themselves.</TE>

<TE>   I don't know if I understand this current business with Enron and
some of these other companies. I was audited by the IRS for a couple
of hundred dollars, and yet these people are talking about hiding and
moving around billions of dollars. I guess it's better to go after
Joe Citizen. Maybe someone ought to call the IRS and advise it that
there might be some type of fraud going on.</TE>

<TE>   For once I agree with President Bush regarding his statements on
corporate shenanigans. To put some action behind his speech I suggest
that Kenneth Lay be arrested, all his assets frozen and small
investors made whole. Let's see if the president really means what he
says.</TE>

<LD>"Builder Got Break on Safety Rules" (July 7) unfortunately
misconstrues a key tool for preserving, rehabilitating and reusing
Los Angeles' historic buildings. Flexibility in building and fire
code interpretation is critical for historic structures and can be
achieved while maintaining a high standard of safety. If current
building and fire codes (which are designed for new construction) are
strictly applied in the rehabilitation of an existing building, it
often means the loss of historic character. Or worse yet, it means
that historic buildings are not rehabilitated and sit vacant and
deteriorating.</LD>
<LD>   Flexibility in code interpretation does not mean that safety is
disregarded; rather, it means that alternative measures are used to
achieve the same standard of safety as well as preservation of
historic features. The adaptive reuse ordinance embodies this
approach and, in so doing, has become the city's most effective
incentive for preserving Los Angeles' cultural resources.</LD>

<HD>Nevada Waste Site Approved by Congress</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As is apparent in "Senate OKs Nevada Nuclear Waste Site" (July 10),
the Department of Energy's plan to store nuclear waste beneath Yucca
Mountain is a hazard not only to Nevada but to the rest of the U.S.
Apparently, some of our representatives think it is fine to store
nuclear waste in an area intersected by more than 30 earthquake
faults, where water will flow down into an aquifer that provides
drinking water for a neighboring community.</LD>
<LD>   With hundreds of significant, unresolved technical issues declared
outstanding by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, this plan would
require transporting the dangerous waste through more than 100
cities. I cannot wait to see the first rail container containing many
times the amount of long-lived radioactive material that was released
at Hiroshima traveling through my backyard. Nevadans are fighting
with lawsuits while the NRC considers the implications of this plan.
Let us fight with them to make the nation safe for future
generations.</LD>

<TE>   I was curious whether any of the scientists or politicians have
considered the feasibility of some technology that could convert the
energy within nuclear waste into other forms of power. If I remember
my college physics professors correctly, energy is not created but
merely changed from one form to another. Could we not recycle the
nuclear waste energy into something more useful instead of creating a
huge, 10,000-year storage problem?</TE>

<HD>Wolfram's Cosmos Theory May, or May Not, Compute</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "The Code of the Cosmos," July 9: Stephen Wolfram's theory seems
to be an attempt to develop a GUT, or grand unified theory, long
sought by many as a "holy grail." Such a theory would necessarily
integrate all of the current, disparate theories (gravity,
electromagnetism, et al.), each of which may explain some smaller
part of the cosmos.</LD>
<LD>   The code that Wolfram is seeking may be the cosmos' equivalent of
DNA. Such "universal DNA" as an ingredient of the big bang might help
explain how a singularity could contain sufficient inconsistency to
produce such a varied universe, and not the homogeneous sphere that
one might expect. Just as DNA contains the "computer program" for
life, might not a single, admittedly elegant line of code contain the
instructions for the entire universe?</LD>
<LD>   At one time, DNA was inconceivable. The question now is, of
course, "Who wrote that code?"</LD>
<TE>   Charles Lee</TE>
<TE>   Hemet</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I found your article to be of tremendous interest. Wolfram's
holistic/non-reductionist approach is commonly referred to as
"complexity theory" and has a larger following than was apparent in
your article. Many meteorologists, economists, geologists, biologists
and artists have used this theory to achieve better results than were
previously possible.</TE>
<TE>   This study of nonlinear dynamic systems (including cosmology,
evolution, art, the economy, fluid dynamics, the weather) has
important implications for the future of mankind. One important tenet
is that these systems are inherently unpredictable. This suggests
that genetic modification of food and the environment should be
absolutely avoided, and that the outcomes of "regime change" and
other foreign policy concepts cannot be predicted, thus encouraging
us to pursue other, more conservative, approaches. Complexity theory
bridges science and beauty, art, mankind and the environment. Who
says science is boring?</TE>
<TE>   Gayle Ellett</TE>
<TE>   Topanga</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your account of this eccentric, possibly revolutionary physicist
is wonderful and revelatory. However, it neglects to make one crucial
observation that discredits Wolfram's entire theory that the universe
and everything in it is reducible to a few short lines of elementary
computer code: the principle of self-determination.</TE>
<TE>   Computer code does only what its programmed parameters allow it to
do. Human beings have no programmed parameters, with suicide being
the most obvious manifestation of that. And since, for better or
worse, human beings have taken control of the heretofore naturally
programmed Earth, this planet also falls outside of the
predictability of Wolfram's oversimplistic theory.</TE>
<TE>   This much is predictable: Wolfram's appeal to the masses is a
desperate attempt to encourage the public to validate something only
the scientific community is capable of sanctioning.</TE>
<TE>   Small wonder, then, that Wolfram conveniently circumvented the one
community capable of squelching his Game Boy universe.</TE>

<HD>The Role of Hatred in the Killings at LAX</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dennis Prager's July 10 commentary on the LAX shootings ("Muslims'
Plague of Hatred") is a good illustration of why ethnic hatreds
persist. He castigates government officials for delay and indecision
because they want to investigate before drawing any firm conclusions.
No such investigation is necessary for Prager. He does not rush to
judgment; his judgment is instantaneous--it is clearly an
anti-Semitic hate crime. Let us hope our government officials
continue to try to determine what the facts are in such regrettable
occurrences. Otherwise we will surely attain new heights of bigotry.</LD>
<LD>   W.A. Mueller</LD>
<LD>   Sherman Oaks</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Prager has articulated precisely why the attack is clearly an act
of terrorism. My only question is: Why do we Americans continue to
send billions, year after year, to Egypt--a government that has
proven to be neither a friend nor an ally to America? The Egyptian
government continues to give false propaganda about America to its
people and fills its people's hearts with venomous hatred toward
America. Why should it continue to receive money from us?</TE>
<TE>   Klara Shandling</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Prager wants us to "acknowledge Muslim hate" as the root cause of
all the violence and resentment against Americans and Jews. How
convenient! Could the systematic and large-scale oppression of
Muslims by Israel and, indirectly, the U.S., maybe, just maybe, have
anything to do with the resentment and sense of injustice that
Muslims feel?</TE>
<TE>   If not, then let us expand this "plague of hatred" to include the
anger that all oppressed people have ever felt toward their
oppressors. Let us then say that black slaves who fought against
their white masters were plagued with hate, that feminists were
nothing but man-haters and that any struggles of the disenfranchised
anywhere are motivated purely by "hate."</TE>

<HD>A Serious Case of Summer Blues</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Any day, any minute now, summer is going to arrive. Isn't it? After
all, the signposts and seasonal cues are there, those reassuring
little rituals that measure out our lives with metronomic precision.</LD>
<LD>   Memorial Day and the Fourth of July have already come and gone,
trailing phosphorescent clouds of nostalgia and patriotism. Wimbledon
and the summer solstice are but fond memories.</LD>
<LD>   A few days ago, Major League Baseball's All-Stars put off their
impending strike long enough to distract us with their annual
slug-fest. Closer to home, the L.A. Philharmonic has donned its white
evening wear and hunkered down at the Hollywood Bowl until Labor Day.
Meanwhile, a giddy Hollywood basks in the moonglow of record
box-office hauls.</LD>
<TE>   School's out. The beaches are open. And after a lengthy bout of
what sunny-minded Angelenos darkly refer to as "June gloom,"
temperatures this week shot up into the 90s.</TE>
<TE>   Why, then, does it somehow not feel like summer? Maybe because
this summer has been plagued by so many false starts, deferred
expectations, odd flashes of lightning. Yep, it's summertime, and the
livin' is uneasy.</TE>
<TE>   This summer's flair for the bizarre and troubling was symbolized
by Tuesday's All-Star game. Faced with a 7-7 tie in the 11th inning
of a contest that already had run 3 1/2 hours, Major League
Commissioner Bud Selig declared the game over and sent the players to
the showers--without an MVP named--while fans cursed and pelted the
field with garbage.</TE>
<TE>   The official excuse was that both teams had run out of pitchers.
But it was a Twilight Zone coda to a baseball season already tainted
with strike threats and an alleged steroid craze. What's next for
America's beloved summer pastime? Banning Cracker Jack in the
bleachers? Canceling the seventh-inning stretch?</TE>
<TE>   Across the West, the season of iced tea and surfer tunes opened to
the roar of some of the worst forest fires in U.S. history, laying
waste to huge stretches of wilderness and threatening to engulf
entire communities. Incredibly, of the two alleged suspects in the
Colorado and Arizona blazes, one is a U.S. Forest Service employee,
the other a firefighter. A friend, just back from the Great American
Summer Family Vacation, was asked how he'd found those amber fields
of grain and purple mountains' majesty. "Covered in smoke, mostly,"
he e-mailed back.</TE>
<TE>   Not all this summer's disasters are natural ones. Wasn't this
supposed to be the season the American economy threw off its
lingering 9/11 jitters and high-tech blues, so we could all get back
to making money hand over fist? Instead we've watched one Fortune 500
company after another go down in flames, victims of their own
executives' finagling, or of creative accounting practices, or some
combination thereof. As the stock market continues to tank, President
Bush, after pledging to crack down on white-collar scofflaws, has
been put on the defensive about his own tardiness in disclosing a
1990 stock sale.</TE>
<TE>   Not even national holidays have been exempt from this summer's
nasty tricks. On the Fourth of July, local newscasters were obliged
to open their coverage not with footage of kids gobbling watermelon
and beer-gutted men shagging fly balls in Griffith Park, but with
news of the shooting death of two people by a gunman at LAX. In San
Dimas, the crash of a Cessna in a crowded park cut short the lives of
four people. And last week, the alleged beating of an African
American man in Inglewood by a police officer, caught on videotape,
has raised the specter of other beatings and of long, hot L.A.
summers past.</TE>
<TE>   If parts of this summer have been ominous and unsettling, others
have been just plain strange. An ebullient South Korean soccer team
made the World Cup semifinals while Argentina, Italy and France were
sent packing. Weird.... An iconic '60s rock band hints that it may be
putting out new music for the first time in 20 years. Then its bass
player drops dead of a heart attack on the eve of a U.S. tour.
Weird....</TE>
<TE>   Martha Stewart, America's first lady of domestic bliss, finds
herself transformed into a shifty-eyed harpy staring down from the
tabloid covers, following her alleged stock-trading improprieties.
You have to wonder what Ann Landers would have to say about all this.
(Knowing Ann, probably plenty.)</TE>
<TE>   Even the recent death of Hall of Famer Ted Williams wasn't allowed
to be the dignified, uplifting story of a great American life that it
should've been. A world-class athlete and U.S. military pilot in two
wars, "politically conservative but in his core the most democratic
of men" (as David Halberstam wrote in the New York Times), Williams
was an exemplar of a John Wayne-like brand of rugged individualism.</TE>
<TE>   Now, in a grotesque twist, some of Williams' kin have reportedly
had the old man's body shipped to an Arizona cryonics lab so his DNA
can be frozen and someday used to clone another super-slugger. From
sports immortal to Popsicle stick--what a way to go.</TE>
<TE>   A few years back, in an essay in the New Yorker titled "The Myth
of Summer," Adam Gopnik wrote that a combination of killer traffic,
changing social mores and the meager two weeks most Americans spend
on summer vacation (compared with six for their European
counterparts) had conspired to make the old-fashioned summer passe.
Perhaps because of this, he speculated, Americans more than any other
people cling to the fantasy of an endless summer filled with
leisurely picnics, fat novels spread on beach blankets and people in
tennis whites who look like the Kennedys.</TE>
<TE>   "Since a good summer is ours by right," Gopnik wryly observed, "we
insist we've had one even if we haven't, and make up in symbolism
what we lack in spare time. Summer in America is another place, to be
dreamed of rather than remembered.... Summer is about longing for
summer."</TE>
<TE>   But something more than workaholism or gridlock in the Hamptons
seems required to explain this summer's melancholy. Our carefree
demeanor looks a bit forced this year. Our rituals don't feel as
reassuring. That warm-weather incantation of "praise the Dodgers and
pass the corn on the cob" doesn't quite cut it. And is anyone
seriously going to claim that "Men in Black II" belongs in the same
class of escapist summer fantasy as "Jaws" or "Star Wars"?</TE>
<TE>   Hanging over these reveries, of course, is the harrowing memory of
9/11, its anniversary rushing toward us. It brings to mind E.B.
White's beautiful essay "Once More to the Lake," published in 1941,
the same year Williams became the last major leaguer to hit .400.</TE>
<TE>   Motivated by memories of his vanished childhood, White takes his
son to the same Maine lake that he'd visited as a boy with his own
father. While the narrator tries to convince himself that nothing has
changed and all is right with the world, "a curious darkening of the
sky" and an afternoon thunderstorm set up the essay's unforgettable
climax, when White's son retrieves his wet trunks from the
clothesline and prepares to go swimming with his friends:</TE>
<TE>   "Languidly, and with no thought of going in, I watched him, his
hard little body, skinny and bare, saw him wince slightly as he
pulled up around his vitals the small, soggy, icy garment. As he
buckled the swollen belt, suddenly my groin felt the chill of death."</TE>
<TE>   There is an icy breeze blowing through America this summer that no
East Coast heat wave or Arizona wildfire can dissipate, a dark cloud
no bright Disney pastels can paint over. That, in itself, is not
necessarily surprising or bad. As it does in White's essay, the shock
may only hit us hard if we ignore the rumbles on the horizon, tune
out the warnings, pretend this is a summer like any other. It isn't.</TE>
<TE>   What the country could use in the meantime is a good vacation.
Unless we've been on one for too long already.</TE>

<LD>* We are brothers. Our field trip for Mt. Washington Elementary was
to Knott's Berry Farm. I liked Ghostrider. It made me feel very
scared. The drop was fun and fast. My brother, Zane, liked the
Bigfoot Rapids. It went up and down and splashed through the water. I
thought that was fun.</LD>

<TE>   * My favorite amusement park ride is Splash Mountain at
Disneyland. When I ride it I feel like my stomach will fall out! I
like it because I like getting wet!</TE>

<TE>   Wendy Smith's students at JEI Learning Center in Glendale tell
about their favorite rides.</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite ride is Jurassic Park at Universal Studios. When I
first rode on it, I felt scared, but then I realized there was
nothing to be afraid of except the part where you go down. Still,
that part is fun too. I like it very much because it takes you
through a place where there are a lot of fake dinosaurs that look
real. (Melissa, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * I like this place called Raging Waters because there is a water
slide that makes me feel happy when I go on it. (Christine, 6)</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite ride is Pirates of the Caribbean at Disneyland
because it is scary. (Ian, 6)</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite ride is the Dragon roller coaster at Legoland. I
feel very happy when I go on that ride. I like it because it has lots
of loops to loops. (Felix, 7)</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite ride is Thunder Mountain roller coaster at
Disneyland. It makes me scared, but it's not scary. (Michelle, 7)</TE>
<TE>   * I went to Legoland and rode the bicycle ride. It was fun because
you can make it go fast. (Ryan, 7)</TE>
<TE>   * The Superman roller coaster is my favorite ride. It makes me
happy if I yell. (Sharon, 7)</TE>

<TE>   "Woodrow, the White House Mouse"</TE>
<TE>   by Peter W. Barnes and Cheryl Shaw Barnes</TE>
<TE>   This is a rhyming book that you can learn from. There are fun
facts about the presidents and the presidency. It is also about the
White House and what its rooms are used for.</TE>
<TE>   The White House was rebuilt in 1812 after the British burned it.
The West Wing was added in the early 1900s. The East Wing was
constructed during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   The rooms in the White House are used for different things. The
president works in the Oval Office. The Green and Red rooms are used
as parlors. The Blue Room is the main reception room. I think this is
a great book!</TE>

<HD>No Way to Treat a Loyal Pet Owner</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Domino is probably on the phone with his lawyer right now,
complaining about that little operation I forced upon him a few years
back or the lack of variety in his daily dinner fare.</LD>
<LD>   Given his canine heritage, he must be sniffing changes in the wind
that might signal a change in his lowly status in a house full of
human beings.</LD>
<LD>   If the Los Angeles Animal Services Commission has its way, my
stint as dog owner may soon be over, and I'll become, instead, the
guardian of the "animal companion" I just whacked with a newspaper
for going through the trash.</LD>
<TE>   The guy leading the campaign to humanize pets sounds wacky enough
to be in need of a little guardianship himself. Veterinarian Elliot
M. Katz considers the term "pet" demeaning and would like us to stop
"objectifying" our "animal companions" by considering them property.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, that argument prevailed before the agency overseeing
the city's animal shelters--where more than 45,000 animals are put to
death each year. And on July 22, the agency will decide whether to
press the City Council to strike the term "pet owner" from its local
codes.</TE>
<TE>   Our attitude is a throwback to less enlightened times, he says,
comparing the ownership of dogs and cats to the enslavement of blacks
and exploitation of Native Americans during colonial times.</TE>
<TE>   As a descendant of both slaves and natives, I resent being
compared to my dogs, who drink from the toilet, lick their privates
in public and will eat anything that's not nailed down.</TE>
<TE>   Don't get me wrong; I love Domino and Puff. My pets sleep on the
beds, eat gourmet dog food and have an entire shelf in the linen
closet dedicated to their medicine, vitamins and grooming aids.</TE>
<TE>   I once resorted to consulting a psychic--a pet communicator, she
called herself--to try to fathom the wishes of my dying dog before I
signed off on euthanasia.</TE>
<TE>   And I've been known to reject potential suitors because the dogs
didn't warm to them or they weren't appropriately deferential.</TE>
<TE>   But still, a dog is a dog and not a person. That's why Noel and
Knoller went on trial in the San Francisco mauling death of Diane
Whipple, rather than their killer dogs, Bane and Hera.</TE>
<TE>   Pets can be taught to come, to fetch, to stay, to roll over, but
they will never be able to exercise the judgment we expect from
rational humans.</TE>
<TE>   They are simple creatures, driven by instinct, loyalty, routine.</TE>
<TE>   That is why we love them, why we feel so compelled to care for
them. And that's why we, not they, are in charge.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of elevating their official status has been floating
around for years, promoted by animal-rights groups, some of them
radical enough to seek abolishing the raising of farm animals, the
use of animals in medical research, as well as the zoos and aquariums
that display them.</TE>
<TE>   Already a handful of cities around the country have adopted the
new lingo, decreeing that pet owners be called guardians instead.</TE>
<TE>   They tout the term's symbolic meaning, as a means of expressing
respect for our furry friends.</TE>
<TE>   But vets are wringing their hands over other prospects, fearful
that challenges to animals' medical care will fuel malpractice suits
and result in skyrocketing liability costs that could push veterinary
care out of reach of all but the most affluent pets and their
check-writing guardians.</TE>
<TE>   Even animal lovers like Bob Vella, host of the syndicated radio
program "Pet Talk America" worries that "animals would, over time, be
able to sue for such things as not wanting to be eaten, not wanting
to be in zoos, or tested on, or being 'enslaved' as a Seeing Eye
dog."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, animals' rights would begin to trump humans'. But
then, some say they already have.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not worried that anarchy will result if we allow our pets the
privilege of near-equal status. It's not a scary proposal, just a
silly one. And certainly an unnecessary one. We already treat our
animals as well or better than we treat our human family and friends.</TE>
<TE>   Almost half the families in America have a dog or cat, and
three-quarters of them consider their pet "a member of the family"
rather than a possession.</TE>
<TE>   More than 90% have photos of their pets on display, 85% refer to
themselves as "mom" or "dad" in pet-related conversations, and almost
75% of married pet owners say they greet their pets before their
spouses when they arrive home from work each day.</TE>
<TE>   One-third of pet owners admit to talking to their pets on the
phone or leaving messages for them on the answering machine.</TE>
<TE>   We consider the needs of our pets in family decisions on
everything from when and where we go on vacation to what kind of
vehicle we drive and where we live and which house we buy.</TE>
<TE>   During my family's house-hunting excursions, we ruled out homes
near busy streets because if the dogs got out, they might get hit by
a car.</TE>
<TE>   A friend recently moved from a two-story to a one-story home,
because her aging dog could no longer climb the stairs.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Katz, a "dog guardian" who lives in Northern California,
complains that we treat pet ownership too cavalierly.</TE>
<TE>   He's seen people abandon cats because they clawed the furniture or
dogs because they piddled on the floor, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Well, we've also seen children abandoned and mistreated for less
than that--newborn babies thrown in dumpsters, handicapped teenagers
locked in closets, toddlers beaten to death because they won't stop
crying or scalded in hot tubs because they wet their pants.</TE>
<TE>   If something as simple as changing a name could guarantee humane
behavior, none of us would object. Guardian, caregiver, animal
pal--it's not the name that keeps our pets safe.</TE>
<TE>   The bigger challenge is convincing those who tend our children to
treat those little ones with the same sort of love and affection that
so many of us reserve for pets.</TE>

<LD>Not only was Tom Rothman honored for his philanthropic leadership at
a benefit for the Los Angeles Jewish Home for the Aging, he was
serenaded by pianist-crooner Harry Connick Jr. and ribbed by comedian
Ray Romano.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm going to play two of your favorite songs," Connick told
Rothman, co-chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, and his wife,
Jessica, at the home's 90th anniversary gala Tuesday at the Ballroom
at Hollywood &amp; Highland.</LD>
<LD>   Backed by a polished jazz ensemble, Connick launched into dreamy
renditions of "The Way You Look Tonight" and "Our Love Is Here to
Stay."</LD>
<TE>   Taking the spotlight after more than 900 guests had dined on roast
beef and chocolate cake, Romano reminded Rothman that he'd given
Romano permission to "make fun of the home."</TE>
<TE>   "But nahhhhhh, I'm not going to do that," the comedian promised.
And then, a beat later: "The home has made over a million tonight,
but what people don't know is $900,000 of that goes straight to
ointment," Romano deadpanned. "So, keep on giving. They need more!"</TE>
<TE>   The "Reflections" gala, which grossed $1.2 million for the upkeep
of the home and the care of its 800 residents, also recognized game
show host Monty Hall and his wife, Marilyn. The couple head the
home's Marilyn and Monty Hall Statesman's Club, which, since it was
founded in 1987, has helped raise more than $30 million.</TE>
<TE>   During the festivities, Rothman took time to reflect on how his
parents, Donald and Elizabeth Rothman, who were also guests, have
influenced his life: Their support and unconditional love have made
the difference, he said. In turn, those gifts have inspired the
positive development of his daughters, Elizabeth and Nora. "That is
something even more lasting and particularly relevant to the spirit
of this evening."</TE>
<TE>   On the scene: gala co-chairs Steven Bickel and Barbara Miller-Fox;
outgoing home chairman Meyer Gottlieb; incoming chairman Earl
Greinetz; Richard Hall; Joanna Gleason; Sharon Hall Kessler; Molly
Forrest; Joyce Eisenberg-Keefer; Sylvia and Sherman Grancell; Paul
Goldenberg; Peggy and Peter Goldwyn; and Jim Gianopulos.</TE>

<TE>   Arts Festival Party</TE>
<TE>   Against a backdrop of his hand-painted silk scarves, artist James
Nussbaum dispensed flutes of fizzing Veuve Cliquot to visitors at the
preview party for the Festival of the Arts in Laguna Beach. Pointing
to an oversize scarf embellished with a Persian-inspired motif, he
said, "When I created this I thought, instead of always concentrating
on the tragedy [of the Middle East], why not celebrate its beauty?"</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of art lovers attended the 70-year-old nonprofit
festival's preview July 3. Besides ogling sculpture, paintings,
jewelry and photography, guests sipped fine wines and cruised food
stations featuring the culinary specialties of local restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   "Laguna is about art, and this is the art party of the year," said
guest Al Roberts. "People come to shop and hear the buzz." Most
guests snubbed the black-tie option--the preferred atire being aloha
shirts and summer dresses.</TE>
<TE>   The work of 140 artists is featured at the juried festival. Among
the pieces being shown were fashion-inspired canvases by Brenda K.
Bredvik of Laguna Beach (wearing an ivory silk gown that belonged to
her grandmother), who had created colorful portrayals of a Louis
Vuitton bowling bag, and rose-accented shoes and handbag designed by
Kate Spade. "I enjoy doing shoes and bags because they are so
sculptural," said Bredvik.</TE>
<TE>   The subjects in the paintings of mixed-media artist Sandra Jones
Campbell seemed to be staring back at party-goers. She splashes her
large canvases with "social sightings"--people caught in social
situations, some interacting, some not. "You are looking at them and
they are looking back at you," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The festival, at 650 Laguna Canyon Road, continues until Sept. 1
and is open daily from 10 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. For information, call
(949) 494-1145.</TE>

<LD>The plane landed in Rapid City and Gretchen waited impatiently until
she could get off and hug Grandpa. She knew he would be outside
standing beside his dusty four-wheel drive, eager to tell her what
he'd found on his ranch in South Dakota. Gretchen and her mom and dad
returned each summer to see him and Grandma. Each time, he had a
wonderful surprise waiting for her.</LD>
<LD>   Gretchen saw him standing beside his Jeep. "Grandpa," she shouted.
"What's new?" Usually he couldn't wait to tell her, but this time he
only said, "Come on, everyone. We can talk on the way."</LD>
<LD>   Gretchen and her mom and dad hopped in and buckled up. Grandpa
took the shortcut to the highway that soon turned into gravel roads.</LD>
<TE>   "Where's Grandma?" Gretchen asked. Maybe the surprise had
something to do with her this time.</TE>
<TE>   "She's making supper," he said. "It'll be ready when we get
there."</TE>
<TE>   Then Grandpa grinned at her in the rearview mirror. "Guess you're
wondering what the surprise is this year."</TE>
<TE>   Gretchen smiled back and nodded.</TE>
<TE>   Grandpa kept on driving and didn't say a word.</TE>
<TE>   Gretchen remembered that once he'd found Indian arrowheads on his
ranch. Another time, he discovered gold nuggets. She wondered what he
had found this time.</TE>
<TE>   An hour later they turned into the ranch driveway and took off
through the pasture, then drove over some rough ground where there
wasn't a road at all. Finally, they stopped. Gretchen hopped out with
Grandpa and they walked to a low hillside where some people were
digging.</TE>
<TE>   "Look," he said, pointing down.</TE>
<TE>   Gretchen looked. The people were digging some big bones out of the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a dinosaur!" Gretchen said.</TE>
<TE>   "A duck-billed dinosaur. She's about 67 million years old,"
Grandpa said, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   Then he added, "Thought I'd name her Gretchen."</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Van Steenwyk recently went on her first dinosaur dig and
made a discovery. She loved it! This story will be on The Times' Web
site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<HD>Streisand Slept Here</HD>
<DH>The Barbra tour fits Malibu, not Memphis, but her fans are
as devoted as Elvis'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It isn't Graceland. They tell you that right upfront. The folks who
run the Ramirez Canyon Park, formerly the Barbra Streisand Center for
Conservancy Studies, formerly the Barbra Streisand Malibu estate, are
sick of the Graceland comparisons, and they want everyone to know
that this is not a tourist attraction in the traditional sense. No
tram ride, no gift shop (although there are a few pine cones and
postcards for sale), no snack bar (although the admission price
includes a very nice tea), no huge, sun-scorched parking lot.</LD>
<LD>   Tours are held only Wednesdays, and carpooling is required--local
regulations allow them only 40 round trips a day on the winding road
to the estate. The docents are trained to avoid any discussion of
Streisand's personal life, to treat her design decisions with the
utmost respect, to draw attention instead to the finer details of
four of the five houses on the 22-acre property--the Bakelite
sculptures in the Art Deco house, the hand-singed shingles of the
Barn where Streisand actually lived, the bleached pine of Barwood,
the bungalow she converted into a semi-treehouse to use as an office.</LD>
<TE>   But they're not fooling themselves: No one thinks a person would
pay 30 bucks a pop to see some fairly eccentric buildings and a copse
of lovely sycamores. The folks that keep the carpools necessary and
the waiting lists weeks-long are here because of Barbra. Because they
loooove Barbra.</TE>
<TE>   "I must tell you that Barbra Streisand was a perfectionist," says
Sandee Bickart, who led a recent tour of about 35 people, mostly
women, many old enough to have seen "Funny Girl" in its first
Broadway run. She will mention Streisand's perfectionism at least a
dozen times in the course of an hour and a half, and every time she
does, the crowd will murmur and nod their heads in rueful, fond
agreement like family members discussing a headstrong but favored
niece.</TE>
<TE>   "She still is," one woman answers the second time Bickart makes
her observation, "she still is." And again, that murmur of agreement
and intimacy rises from beneath the leaves of those sycamores, which
still mark the original path of a stream that ran through the
property, a stream Streisand had moved about 100 yards so she could
have a nice lawn. Such a perfectionist. Heads nod when the star's
penchant for old lace is mentioned, when her love of thrift shops is
noted; if, as Bickart says, she hasn't read even one biography, she
is the only one here who hasn't.</TE>
<TE>   When, standing beside the pool of the Art Deco house, Bickart
mentions that this is where Jason Gould, Barbra's son with first
husband Elliott Gould, had his bar mitzvah party, everyone smiles and
sighs. "Well, it really is the perfect place," one woman says to her
friend.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the obvious devotion to its former owner, Ramirez Canyon
Park truly isn't Graceland, or anything like it. Streisand's baroque
quotient doesn't even approach an Elvis rating, and this isn't
Memphis, it's Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   The park formerly known as the Barbra Streisand Center is not so
much a tourist attraction as it is an unexpected nexus of the powers
that have shaped Southern California as certainly and specifically as
the surf has shaped its coastline.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrity, wealth, philanthropy, ecology, zoning laws, crotchety
neighborhood activism, the Coastal Commission, the vagaries of
fashion and good old-time voyeurism all come together on the lovely
stone patio outside the Barn, which is where, according to Bickart,
"Barbra liked to entertain her really close friends."</TE>
<TE>   The story of how the park came to be is told on every tour. In the
beginning there were seven acres at the end of Ramirez Canyon Road
and the Barn in which lived Jon Peters, hairstylist. Streisand moved
in with Peters in 1974 and over the years the two converted a nearby
stable into the Peach House and purchased three other adjacent
properties--15 additional acres in all. By the late '80s, Peters and
Streisand had split, and Streisand put the property on the market for
a cool $19 mil. No sale.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, she decided to donate it to the Santa Monica Mountains
Conservancy and take a $15-million tax write-off. But she made no
endowment for its upkeep, and the property costs about $160,000 a
year to maintain. So the conservancy began thinking of it as a place
various green groups could rent out for conferences and even
retreats.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, they offered tours and rented the grounds out for
weddings, photo shoots, even movies.</TE>
<TE>   The neighbors complained. Loudly, bitterly and in court. Ramirez
Canyon Road is narrow and winding, not intended for catering trucks
and busloads of gawking out-of-towners. The people who live along the
road obviously value privacy. Enter the California Coastal
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Conferences were out, retreats were out, anything that required
more than 40 vehicles per day to the park or a vehicle larger than a
15-seat passenger van was out. The conservancy is now required to do
community outreach, which it says it was doing already--groups of
elderly people and disadvantaged and disabled children are brought to
the park for special tours and events. There is still an unresolved
legal case involving zoning and the city of Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   At some point during the litigious years, Streisand took her name
off the establishment, which puts the conservancy in an odd and
difficult position. The star's name is the only thing it has going
for it in terms of visitor draw, but, according to Marsha Feldman,
supervisor of events and operations at the park, the conservancy
doesn't think it's appropriate to advertise the park as the former
Barbra Streisand estate.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to respect people's privacy," she says, adding that
although people may come because of the name, they soon find
themselves captivated by the beauty of the place. "People don't want
to leave," she says. "It's just so beautiful and relaxing here."</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't it lovely?" Bickart says often during the tour. "Tell all
your friends."</TE>
<TE>   The park is lovely, how could it not be, set as it is, as Bickart
points out, in a truly Mediterranean climate. Streisand spruced it up
even further with hundreds of nonnative trees, including a few
gorgeous redwoods and shrubs. Yes, the Barn seems faux-rustic and
oddly laid out, but it was the '70s, after all, and many style
decisions made during that decade do not stand up to post-millennial
scrutiny. Yes, there is something unnerving about the fact that the
Art Deco house was built solely to house Streisand's Art Deco
collection--even she apparently found it too emotionally cold to live
in. There is something poignant too about the fact that in this
five-home compound there is only one guest bedroom--aside from the
Barn and the caretaker's house, the rest of the houses were used as
offices or for entertaining.</TE>
<TE>   But what provides the electricity of the tour is the knowledge
that this is not Graceland or Hearst Castle or any number of other
famous home tours. Nothing here is excessively excessive, and the
woman is still alive, after all, still living somewhere in Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   So the feeling is more like a hybrid between the Pasadena homes
tour and a very high-end open house party. Add to that the palpably
sincere gratitude the conservancy staff seems to feel for Streisand
and one finds it almost impossible to muster the half-envious
ridicule that often fuels the voyeurism associated with these kinds
of tours, even when confronted with a 4-foot-high, apricot onyx
fireplace.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, one finds oneself listening to Bickart's thumbnail
histories of the Chumash Indians, Malibu and Bakelite, lulled by the
murmur of the rerouted brook, picturing 500 luminaries gathering on
the meadow (constructed from the dirt removed during the terracing of
her orchard) for the One Voice concert Streisand gave to raise money
for then presidential nominee Bill Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   It is indeed an oasis, tucked into the velvety folds of the Santa
Monica Mountains, and how else would most of us ever get to see such
a place? To imagine what it would be like to live in a place like
this, to be a person like that, a movie star, an icon, someone who
bought the house next door by handing the new owner a check for
double what she just paid, someone who replanted redwoods and
rerouted a stream, someone who built a whole house just for her art.
Someone who then turned around and gave the whole kit and caboodle
away.</TE>

<CX>   Streisand fund-raiser -- A Southern California Living story on July
14 about tours of Barbra Streisand's former Malibu estate incorrectly
characterized Streisand's One Voice concert on the property as a
fund-raiser for Bill Clinton. The concert had raised funds for
Democratic senatorial candidates.</CX>

<HD>The Screen-Eyed Monster</HD>
<DH>Coveting thy neighbor's oversized television? You're not
alone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE GORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At first he was simply Big TV Man.</LD>
<LD>   He lived in the tower across the street, 10th floor. Come
nightfall, his 9-foot living-room wall would be swallowed by massive,
flickering blue images. My dinner guests would stop their
conversation midsentence and just stare across the divide into his
picture window, mesmerized.</LD>
<LD>   The women wondered if Big TV Man was rich. The guys cracked jokes
to mask feelings of inadequacy. My jealous boyfriend took to aiming a
red laser pointer into Big TV Man's Swinging Digital Den, smirking
whenever our neighbor was jolted from the reverie of his massive
projection system.</LD>
<TE>   My comrades, like so many other Americans, had been gripped by
screen envy. Nagging gremlins of inferiority would cling to the bases
of their brains until they too got a big screen.</TE>
<TE>   Silly? Perhaps. Real? You bet; experts call screen envy a genuine
social phenomenon that is on the rise from New Jersey to the far side
of the Pacific. Today's 57-inch TV carries the same social clout the
hottest hot rod did in the 1950s or the biggest stereo in the 1970s.
It's that must-have item that, many feel, separates the hip from the
hopeless.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys who were first part of the cassette-tape generation are
in their 30s and 40s, and now have the homes to replace their cars as
their primary location for entertaining," says Guy Primus, vice
president of Blue Flame Marketing and Advertising in New York. "The
same guys that wanted the fastest car 20 or 30 years ago want the
biggest and best home entertainment system now."</TE>
<TE>   Psychologists and marketers say screen envy happens like this: The
owner of a mega-inch TV is happily minding his own business until
his--and it's usually a "his"--best friend gets a mega-plus-1-inch.
Next time there's a basketball game, the party moves to the home of
the newly anointed altar of viewing pleasure. The onetime alpha male
of the entertaining pack becomes the beta, and screen envy is
planted.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a 25-inch TV for a while, and then my buddy got a 32-inch
TV, and that was it. It's been a competition from there," says Mike
Surbrug, a stockbroker in Roselle Park, N.J. "Right after that, my TV
broke, and I got a 35-inch.... I thought, 'I have the biggest TV.' "
Until another buddy bought a 36-inch weeks later. Overnight,
Surbrug's inadequate diagonal count became the butt of jokes. Then,
within another few weeks, Surbrug's roommate trumped everybody by
getting a $3,000, 57-inch behemoth.</TE>
<TE>   Detente. For now.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys just want to perfect their dream entertainment centers, I
guess," Surbrug says. "I am not done at all."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Nuccitelli, a psychologist and the executive director of
SLSHealth.com, a wellness clinic in Brewster, N.Y., says Surbrug's
experience is indicative that new status symbols have arrived along
with the new millennium. "A big-screen TV is a sign of material
wealth and is an ego boost" for this generation, Nuccitelli says.</TE>
<TE>   The widespread introduction of flat-screen in the late 1990s meant
that, for the first time, videophiles no longer had to choose between
floor space and screen size. Big-screen and high-definition TVs are
expected to exceed $8 billion in sales this year, according to the
Consumer Electronics Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, surging growth in DVD technology is fueling new
excuses to buy a TV that can handle a wide-screen format. Sales in
DVD players--as expensive as $500 five years ago but now as little as
$100 in discount stores--are growing by double-digit percentages,
while VCR sales have been falling slightly, according to April data
from the association.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows the identity of screen envy's Patient Zero. But
chances are it was a sports fan. Increasingly, towns with
top-performing teams--Lakers-loving Los Angeles included--are being
linked with upswings in big-screen sales.</TE>
<TE>   TV retailers in Indiana say big screens sell faster every time the
Hoosiers make the Final Four. And Hanoi retailers, in advance of this
year's World Cup, experienced a similar blip in big-screen demand,
the Vietnam News Agency reported. Vietnamese employers even bought
big screens to keep the staffs from calling in sick to watch the
matches.</TE>
<TE>   "When Jerome Bettis runs over a defensive back, we want to see the
slobber fly out of the poor guy's mouth and his eyes roll back in his
head," says ad exec Primus. "Having a giant TV is the next best thing
to being on the field in uniform--and a lot safer."</TE>
<TE>   But there's a high price to succumbing to screen envy, literally.
Screen-envy victims rarely get away with a fix for less than $1,200.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles resident Brill Bundy knows that well. The rare female
victim of the syndrome, Bundy is managing editor of TV coverage for
Zap2It.com, a Web site owned by The Times' parent company, Tribune
Co.</TE>
<TE>   Bundy fights her condition, refusing to buy a screen bigger than
her current 33-incher. Instead, she says, she gets her fix by peeping
into people's windows around her Fairfax neighborhood, noting who has
bigger diagonals.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been caught," Bundy says. "I'm never that obvious.
I'll maybe stop, catch a few minutes of 'Sex and the City,' and move
on."</TE>
<TE>   Bundy traces her condition back two years, when she first moved to
Los Angeles from Texas where her 33 inches did her proud. Back in the
Lone Star State, she insists, "nobody else had big TVs."</TE>
<TE>   Other victims betray their condition through their wallets. Take
John McGann, who told his wife last year he would only move the
family from Venice Beach if he could have a pool and a 57-inch TV.</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, he paid more for that TV--$10,500--than he did to
furnish the new home--$7,000. And guess which item arrived at the
house first? "I had this massive TV, and there was not a stick of
furniture in the new house," says McGann, a real-estate appraiser who
moved to Westchester in November.</TE>
<TE>   Wouldn't that money have been useful for his retirement? "Oh, I'm
56," McGann says. "I've got plenty of time for that."</TE>
<TE>   One more symptom of screen envy: loss of ability to communicate.
"Why did I want this TV?" McGann repeats a question. "I just wanted
it."</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us back to Big TV Man, King of Los Angeles, or, at
least, ruling demigod of any TV lovers who live in my Park La Brea
apartment complex. Big TV Man is actually Ryan Snyder, a very
forgiving urban planner who let me see his projection system even
after I confessed about the laser pointer.</TE>
<TE>   He insists that having a big screen "has never been really
important to me." Easily said, given that Snyder's projection system,
rigged through a healthy-sized TV that also sits in the living room,
registers him immune from screen envy. His digital projector can make
images as big or as small as he wants.</TE>
<TE>   Now all he needs is to sell tickets and popcorn.</TE>

Search for the Historical Jesus."</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Poor George W. Bush. It's the family curse, a mangled strand of
Kennebunkport DNA: Getting splattered, smack in the middle of a
presidential term that otherwise seems to be going pretty well, by
the fallout from an economic downturn that isn't his fault.</LD>
<LD>   Ten years ago, they jeered at his father--"It's the economy,
stupid!"--even though, in the 1992 election year, the country was
slowly emerging from a recession (linked to a stock market crash that
had long preceded his presidency), not entering one. This time
around, the market started to tumble--and the corporate accounting in
some places started to go funny--in early 2000, months before
butterfly ballots, the "Grecians" and the rest of it. Nonetheless,
liberal pundits insist on linking both the current weak economy and
the continuing Enron/WorldCom/Arthur Andersen/Merrill Lynch horror
show to Bush fils, in particular, and to conservative policymakers,
in general.</LD>
<TE>   Here is Salon magazine in high moral dudgeon: "As the stench of
corporate rot grows thicker across the land, more Americans are
coming to the grim realization that the Bush presidency is part of
the problem, not the solution." Bush's 1990 sale of his Harken Energy
Corp. shares--an action the Securities and Exchange Commission
cleared of insider-trading implications in 1993 during the Clinton
presidency--has been trotted out in yet another effort to prove that
Bush and his fellow Republicans must have something to do with
today's bad economic news. We get sententious moralizing from
American Prospect's Robert Kuttner in the Boston Globe: "The career
of George Bush himself epitomizes the kind of self-dealing and
insider enrichment that men like [former Enron CEO] Ken Lay and
[former WorldCom CEO] Bernie Ebbers raised to new heights. Bush can
tactically shift his current policies, but he can't erase his own
record."</TE>
<TE>   And the word "greed" is back. As in "decade of ... "--remember the
1980s? The G-word had been on an eight-year vacation after being
worked to exhaustion by pundits during the administrations of Ronald
Reagan and Bush pere. Salon again, like a broken record: "Republican
excess and Gilded Age greed."</TE>
<TE>   The plain fact remains that what we are witnessing in this summer
of ugly corporate revelations is the unraveling of a Clinton-era
phenomenon. Back then, in the late 1990s, it wasn't called "greed."
It was called "prosperity." It was the linchpin of a phenomenon
called the "new economy," based on the promise of a never-ending,
wealth-creating high-tech explosion, and everyone wanted a part of
it. Your kids' baby-sitter did a little day-trading on the side.
Nearly everyone else withdrew, borrowed, dug out from under the
mattress or stole every dollar he could lay his hands on and threw it
into the stock market, which duly soared. In January 2000, the Dow
Jones industrial average reached an all-time high of 11,722.98, and
the Nasdaq composite index peaked in March at 5,048--more than three
times its value today.</TE>
<TE>   A Santa Ana wind of hype blasted through the land. When WorldCom's
stock, now trading between 12 and 20 cents a share, hit $60 in 1999,
CNBC reporter Maria Bartiromo yelped with glee from the New York
Stock Exchange floor, "Folks, how high can we go?" Talk about excess:
Overjoyed Americans treated themselves to PT Cruisers,
gated-community McMansions, personal trainers and Prada handbags--or
earned good money supplying the newly rich with fine wines, maid
service, estate planning, liposuction, feng shui bathrooms, whatever
they wanted. The new economy was a job machine if nothing else, and
everyone benefited, high and low.</TE>
<TE>   There was no one more eager to take credit for all this than
President Clinton. At the 2000 Democratic Party convention, he played
the rave master to roaring crowds of fans, promising that the party
would go on forever if Americans would only vote for Al Gore. "Are we
going to keep this progress and prosperity going?" he called out to
wild cheers and applause. "Yes!" they shouted. "Yes, we are!" chanted
back the happy-talking Bill. Greed was good in August 2000, because
it had a new twist: Democratic excess. Not surprisingly, Lay
contributed to Democrats as well as Republicans during the 2000
election. Few of the liberal intellectuals who had groused about
corporate acquisitiveness during the Reagan years were heard to
complain about the exact same phenomenon during the Clinton years.</TE>
<TE>   Much was wrong with the mind-set of the new economy, including the
notion that there was any such thing as a "new economy." One false
assumption was that there would be no down cycle in the
ever-expanding waves of high-tech prosperity, so it was safe to build
or buy a vast infrastructure (via vast debt) now and wait for the
inevitable huge profits to roll in later. Then, to keep your
investors (read: Wall Street) happy in order to attract the
capitalization to qualify for credit, you had to show constant
"growth" by some means or other. This did not require offbeat
accounting practices, but the temptation was there. And although
fiber-optic networks are the coming thing, there is a capacity glut,
at least for now. A paradigm new-economy enterprise, Qwest
Communications International Inc., seems to have fallen into every
new-economy pitfall: $26.4 billion worth of debt, miles of never-used
fiber, a stock slide from $66 to $1.77 in two years, coupled with
quarterly losses totaling $5.2 billion, and now, an Enron-like
criminal investigation into manipulations of its balance sheet.</TE>
<TE>   There seems to have been plenty of wrongdoing all around, at Qwest
and elsewhere. It seems nefarious to help yourself, as Qwest's ex-CEO
Joseph Nacchio did in 2001, to $101.7 million in salary, bonuses (for
what?), exercised options and so forth when your company cannot make
a nickel, and the jobs and pension plans of 57,000 modestly
compensated employees are on the line. And George W. looked stupid,
or worse, when, defending a Harken overstatement of earnings while he
sat on its board in 1989, he declared Monday, "I still haven't
figured it out completely." (He made up for the gaffe on Tuesday by
promising tough measures to "end the days of cooking the books" at
corporations.)</TE>
<TE>   The underlying problem, however, isn't Bush or Republicans. It is,
instead, us. Greed, the itch to get rich, is a constant of human
nature, not its most attractive feature (Christian theology brands it
a deadly sin), but a feature nearly impossible to eradicate. As Adam
Smith pointed out, that can be a good thing, for acquisitiveness is
the engine that fuels capitalism, creating jobs and making possible
the current unprecedented U.S. prosperity, even in today's economic
downturn, which has, so far, proved to be very mild. When we can grab
a little of that prosperity for ourselves--let loose our own greed,
so to speak--as we did during the 1990s boom, we like it fine.</TE>
<TE>   We should not forget, though, that greed does have a deadly,
venomous side that can spawn lying, cheating, looting the corporate
treasury and chiseling employees out of the comfortable retirements
they deserve, as is alleged to have happened at Enron. To curb these
ills, we need a stringent network of criminal sanctions and
enforcement mechanisms and a culture in U.S. business that rewards
the honorable. Blaming the president, or his father, or the political
party to which they belong may vent the steam of outrage, but it's
not going to help.</TE>

<DH>A classified planning document describes bold new weapons
and preemptive strategic offensives. But will it lead to the kind of
world we want to live in?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM M. ARKIN</AU>
<BD>William M. Arkin is a military affairs analyst who
writes regularly for Opinion. E-mail: warkin@igc.org</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Out of nowhere, undetected by radar until too late, a U.S. missile
flying at 10 times the speed of sound plunges into an underground
bunker and explodes with shattering force. Overhead, unmanned fighter
jets swarm in to spoof and pillory--pilotspeak for deceive and
punish--enemy air defenses so that other unmanned aircraft can
deliver lancet-like small bombs on individual targets.</LD>
<LD>   Such an attack, and the advanced weapons needed to carry it off,
lies at the heart of a classified document signed by Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld on May 3--the Bush administration's
latest "Defense Planning Guidance." Distributed to senior leaders in
the armed forces to shape their planning and budgeting in the coming
decade and beyond, the document shows just how drastically Rumsfeld
and other senior civilian leaders have changed their thinking since
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   Pushed aside is the earlier preoccupation with antimissile
defenses, space-based weaponry and other programs designed primarily
to protect the United States against foreign aggressors. Instead, the
new emphasis is on a far more interventionist, proactive strategy in
which the United States would stand ready to strike militarily around
the world wherever and whenever it thought its security might be
threatened.</LD>
<TE>   The new strategic watchword is called "forward deterrence," and
the tactical instrument of choice would be what the Defense Planning
Guidance calls "unwarned attacks." What those catch phrases mean in
practical terms is a new and expanded commitment to the creed of
distant warfare--an Afghanistan fighting force on steroids.</TE>
<TE>   "Our challenge in the 21st century is to defend our cities,
friends, allies, and deployed forces--as well as our space assets and
computer networks--from new forms of attack, while projecting force
over long distances to fight new adversaries," Rumsfeld wrote in
Foreign Affairs recently.</TE>
<TE>   What that means to the administration in concrete terms is spelled
out in the new document: Rumsfeld envisions the U.S. military as a
global strike force capable of unilateral action anywhere, any time,
with minimal risk to American lives.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the plan continues to support development of
antimissile defense and means of countering so-called "asymmetric
threats" posed by foreign powers that cannot challenge the United
States in conventional military terms but may be able to inflict
serious casualties through terrorism, say, or weapons of mass
destruction. It also gives rhetorical support to homeland defense.</TE>
<TE>   But these priorities have been overshadowed by more dramatic
departures from past American policies--departures that deserve more
attention from the public than they have gotten.</TE>
<TE>   In his own words, what Rumsfeld wants the military to focus on is
developing weapons and forces capable of undertaking "unwarned
strikes ... [to] swiftly defeat from a position of forward
deterrence."</TE>
<TE>   From the air, that means development of a "high-volume precision
strike," using large quantities of smaller, more precise munitions,
many of them delivered by unmanned aircraft. For other services, the
new doctrine means greater emphasis on collecting intelligence about
possible enemies and the threats they could pose, new techniques for
waging cyber-warfare against communications and information
technology systems, and greater emphasis on the Special Forces.</TE>
<TE>   During its less than two years in office, the Bush administration
has traveled several paths in its thinking about the military and
national security. First the emphasis was on missile defenses, space,
intelligence and information technology. Then came "homeland defense"
and the war in Afghanistan, followed by President Bush's State of the
Union address that focused on the threat of weapons of mass
destruction. Now, in his more recent declaration, Bush announced that
the United States would adopt a strategy for preempting, rather than
deterring, potential adversaries. It is this doctrine of preemption
that Rumsfeld's Defense Planning Guidance reflects.</TE>
<TE>   The military is directed to make cyber-warfare a "core competency"
and resolve outstanding legal and interagency issues relating to
offensive computer network attack. In space, the document directs the
military to develop cyber, laser and electronic warfare capabilities
to deny any adversary use of space. Special operations, particularly
covert capabilities, are stressed. Better intelligence is called for
to provide "sufficient warning of an impending crisis" and to
"identify critical targets for an effects-based campaign."</TE>
<TE>   The war in Afghanistan demonstrated the usefulness of unmanned
drones, and so the document calls for a squadron of 12 unmanned
combat air vehicles to be deployed by 2012. These unmanned armed
fighters would have the ability to fly into enemy airspace and
deliver a variety of weapons without risking American crews.</TE>
<TE>   A Mach-10 hypersonic missile is called for by 2009. Hypersonics
would truly be the next leap for airpower after the age of
supersonics. Air Force briefings have described a laser-propelled or
hydrocarbon-fueled weapon able to traverse 600 nautical miles in 15
minutes or less.</TE>
<TE>   Such a weapon could be cued from space platforms to strike at
mobile missiles, such as the Iraqi Scud missiles used during the Gulf
War, within minutes of launch--before the missile launchers had a
chance to move.</TE>
<TE>   The new document calls for better American capability to strike
"hardened and deeply buried targets" in three rogue nations
simultaneously. This includes building up special operations
capabilities and cyber-warfare, as well as accelerating the
development of a "survivable" earth penetrator fitted with an
existing nuclear warhead. Laser and other "directed energy" weapons
such as high-powered microwave weapons are also called for to attack
underground targets impervious to explosive attack, troops and
computer and communications networks.</TE>
<TE>   In describing the new planning document, a senior defense official
stressed that it is consistent with the transition from traditional
"attrition" warfare to an "effects-based" approach that seeks quick
paralysis instead of step-by-step destruction. "You realize your
adversary is himself a networked operation," the senior official
says. "You look for ways to break down that network and to ensure
[it] can't function. If you do it properly and if you do it well, you
develop ... battle space superiority over your adversary that is
unrivaled."</TE>
<TE>   It all sounds very impressive. And technologically it is. No
target on the planet or in space would be immune to American attack.
The United States could strike without warning whenever and wherever
a threat was perceived, and it would be protected by missile
defenses, a new Department of Homeland Security and a transparency in
the world that Rumsfeld and others expect to come as a result of
greater investments in space, intelligence and information
technology.</TE>
<TE>   And the new approach is said to carry the priceless advantage of
the old Cold War deterrence strategy: If pursued vigorously, it would
never have to be used. "We must develop new assets, the mere
possession of which discourages adversaries from competing," Rumsfeld
says.</TE>
<TE>   So what's the problem?</TE>
<TE>   The answer has two parts.</TE>
<TE>   The first is that the American military is already deep into the
process of transforming itself for the post-Cold War era. It is a
slow, difficult process that tries to balance the varied and
conflicting requirements that the future may bring. Covert Special
Forces and the quick-strike capabilities of light infantry and
precision air power working in conjunction brought quick success in
Afghanistan. Heavier, more powerfully armed and armored conventional
forces might be needed against an enemy such as North Korea or Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Though Rumsfeld's new plan nominally embraces "transformation," it
may actually complicate and impede the process. Perhaps surprisingly,
after the cool relationship that existed between President Bill
Clinton and the military, Rumsfeld's relationship with the services
is not good. He and his close advisors are seen as willfully
isolated, enamored of secret operations and decision-making, beguiled
by a "painless dentistry" approach to war and almost ideological in
their attitude toward intervention. The imbalances in the new Defense
Planning Guidance, coupled with the growing gulf between senior
officers and senior civilians--not over who should be in charge but
over what the policies should be--will make both transformation and
the war on terrorism more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   The second part of the problem is that the document seems to
ignore an axiom even older than Clauswitz or Sun Tzu: It is easier to
get in than to get out. Rumsfeld's emphasis on preemptive
intervention--and acceptance of the unilateralism that tends to come
with it--suggests a belief that Afghanistan was a success and a model
for wars well into the future. This ignores the difficulties that
have followed the rapid toppling of the Taliban. An administration
that came to office scorning "nation-building" is now knee-deep in
the internal quarrels and ancestral politics of a region even
imperial Britain learned to avoid.</TE>
<TE>   Before rushing to embrace a new strategy, we need to think more
clearly about the problem. Even without "transformation," the U.S.
military is already so strong that no one is going to compete with it
any time soon. But then no one competed with our military on Sept.
11, either. And it is not competition with our military that stands
between us and success in Afghanistan or Pakistan, the Philippines or
Sudan.</TE>
<TE>   What is needed, before we get to questions of what kinds of new
super-weapons to build, is a strategy for living in a world in which
we may be able to win every battle, yet still not win the war--much
less the peace.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH BLUM</AU>
<BD>Deborah Blum is a Pulitzer Prize-winning science writer
and author of "Sex on the Brain: The Biological Differences Between
Men and Women."</BD>
<DL>MADISON, Wis.</DL>
<LD>Back in the 1970s, a journalist friend of mine worked for an editor
who thought Mother Nature had two good headlines in her. One was
"Killer Bees Move North"--meaning out of Latin America and across our
borders. The other was "Sharks Sighted in Mississippi River." I like
to imagine him still lurking on a levee, waiting for that first view
of a dorsal fin slicing through the waters outside St. Louis.</LD>
<LD>   Killer bees, though, must have disappointed him. They did cross
the border more than 10 years ago and made themselves at home in the
American Southwest, and they continue to slowly spread north. But the
hyper-headlines didn't arrive with them. In California, hives of
Africanized honeybees--as scientists prefer to call them because they
are the product of interbreeding between European bees and a group of
more aggressive African bees inadvertently released in Brazil during
the 1950s--have now been found beyond Porterville in the San Joaquin
Valley. The reporting has been mostly matter-of-fact, the stories
lacking the murderous spin--or Page 1 sizzle--of earlier reports.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, headline lovers might consider the invasion of
Africanized bees to have been a nonevent. Scientists, on the other
hand, see it as a remarkable story. Journalism and science can be an
interesting mismatch. On the one hand, you have an event-driven
approach, shaped by current interest and intrigue. On the other, you
have a process of exploration conducted detail by cautious detail.
Too often, good science happens after reporters have lost patience
and moved on.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Africanized bees, reports to be presented at
Indiana University during this week's annual meeting of the Animal
Behavior Society confirm that patience can be a virtue. Researchers
seeking to understand the bees have also managed to illuminate the
shape of a perfect invasion. If you want to know how to overrun a
country, look no further than the military strategy of these tough
and capable insects. "The animals are just incredibly successful
invaders," says Robert Page, head of the entomology department at UC
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Counter to expectations, being "killer" bees--well-armed and
famously aggressive--is not an advantage. Compared with our standard
honeybee--imported from Europe centuries ago--the tropical bees are
lethal. Africanized bees attack 20 times faster than those
sweet-tempered Europeans. A swarm can deliver up to 200 stings a
minute. It pursues farther. It stays angry longer. About 30 people
are stung to death annually now in Mexico. In the United States, only
eight people have died since the bees first appeared in 1990, but
some of those deaths have been memorably awful. An unfortunate
Arizona man who pushed a lawnmower over a hive suffered almost 1,000
stings.</TE>
<TE>   Vicious behavior, however, tends to identify you rapidly as an
enemy. The Africanized bees have been marked as killers since
entomologists imported them into Brazil decades ago, hoping to use
them as breeding stock. There is now a growing branch of the
beekeeping industry dedicated to eliminating them. In Mexico City
alone as many as 5,000 hives have been destroyed in a single year.
Swift attack undoubtedly served the bees well on the African savanna,
where they fended off aggressive predators. Traveling across the
human-dense landscape of the Americas, it only served to draw
attention and provoke retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, despite the counterattacks, the bees have thrived
here. Why? Well, partly because these are very paranoid bees.
Complete suspicion is helpful when overrunning hostile territory. At
a hint of threat or disturbance, Africanized bees tend to pack up and
move. Beekeepers call this "absconding," and for people trying to
make a living from hives, it poses a serious problem. Ernesto
Guzman-Novoa, an entomologist at INIFAP-Mexico, the national
agricultural research institute, tells of one beekeeper who brought
9,000 hives with Africanized bees into a region that needed
pollination. Seven thousand hives promptly absconded--Africanized
bees don't like to be moved and didn't trust the territory in
question.</TE>
<TE>   And that's a lot of bees--a small hive can contain 5,000 insects,
a large one up to 50,000. Those numbers reveal another component of a
successful invasion. Make sure the population odds are overwhelmingly
in your favor. Put simply, Africanized bees reproduce so rapidly and
prolifically that no one can kill off enough of them to hold them
back.</TE>
<TE>   "These fascinating bees," as Guzman-Novoa calls them, have other
talents that weren't so well appreciated in the initial panic. They
can eke out a living from the barest of vegetation. Compared with
their softer cousins, they fly faster; they respond faster; their
sensory system is more revved--they pick up on fainter odors and
signals. This may make them jittery, but it also makes them
survivors.</TE>
<TE>   Further, the newest studies show, these bees are extraordinarily
skilled at converting the natives to their approach. At the ABS
meeting Wednesday, Guzman-Novoa and two researchers at Purdue
University, Greg Hunt and Miguel Arechavaleta-Velasco, will detail
the surprising ability of the bees to impose their own behavior
patterns on others. In particular, they can convince their gentler
cousins to fight mean as well.</TE>
<TE>   Entomologists have known for years that the genes that control
aggression in the Africanized bee are superbly dominant. If European
and Africanized bees are bred together, all the offspring are born
fighters. But the entomologists had not realized, until recently,
that the bees were so adept at social influence. In hives that
contain a mix of the two bee types, if scientists approach with a
"threat target"--for instance, a black patch of leather--the
Africanized bees boil out of the hive first. The European bees are
more hesitant. In the first second, 80% of the stings are from
Africanized bees. But within 30 seconds, all the bees are furiously
in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   What better way to complete an invasion than to persuade the
competition to your side? Entomologists are still trying to figure
out this particular talent. Is it peer pressure? Does hanging out
with the bad guys eventually turn you into a bad guy yourself?
Pragmatically, the scientists suspect that the Africanized bees may
release a particularly seductive alarm pheromone. And there seems to
be something about watching violence, seeing a companion hurl himself
into the fray, that brings out the best--or the worst--in the gentler
bees, depending on your point of view.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly from the human perspective, this is a "worst" result. It
emphasizes that the invaders are unlikely to become truly
domesticated--rather, they are far more likely to prod our safer and
sweeter bees into wildness. Most scientists predict continued
adjustments in managing bees, beekeeping, honey production and
commercial pollination. UC Davis entomologist Page also expects a
gradual shift in people's attitudes toward bees--still appreciating
their value and importance but at an increased distance. "These bees
need space," he says. "So that the hive that you used to admire in
your backyard may be something you no longer want quite so close."</TE>
<TE>   Page's team, among others, tracked the bees into the San Joaquin
Valley. He expects them to continue trekking northward. The march has
slowed, although no one is sure exactly why. It may be no more than
the cooler climate--these are tropical bees, after all--providing a
natural limit. In which case, of course, a continued global warming
trend could act enormously to their advantage in this elegantly
handled invasion, built on numbers, toughness, adaptability and a
rare talent for co-opting the homeland population.</TE>
<TE>   So the killer bees have moved north. Instead of stopping them, we
are learning to live with them. Perhaps we should take a reluctant
moment to admire them as well. Human invasions rarely run so
competently and smoothly. It's good to remember, sometimes, that we

<HD>Whither the Poorest in a New Valley City?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL BOYARSKY</AU>
<BD>Bill Boyarsky, former city editor and columnist for The
Times, is senior consultant for the Center for Governmental Studies
and teaches journalism at USC's Annenberg School for Communication.
He is writing a biography of the late California political leader
Jesse Unruh.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The contrast between the late-morning peacefulness of the Barnes &amp;
Noble bookstore in Encino and the dusty misery of a trailer court
about 10 miles away illustrates why cityhood would not free the San
Fernando Valley from the expensive, hard-to-solve cares of urban
life.</LD>
<LD>   In its western portion and hills, the Valley is prosperous. The
farther northeast you travel, the poorer its neighborhoods until you
reach a portion of Sun Valley where a few families live in a trailer
court that resembles a Dust Bowl refugee camp during the Great
Depression. The image of this desperately poor court remained in my
mind when I sought answers to one of the most important questions of
the secession election: How would a new Valley city deal with its
haves and have-nots? Would Encino share its wealth with parts of the
Valley afflicted with bad housing, junkyards, gangs and other urban
ills?</LD>
<LD>   Not that old Los Angeles has done right by the Valley's poor. The
trailer court has existed through several administrations and a City
Council that can't, as Valley secessionists say, see much beyond
downtown and rich Westside neighborhoods. A permanent government of
business and union lobbyists runs City Hall, and its bureaucrats
would rather try to sneak through a downtown football stadium plan
than clean up blighted neighborhoods in Wilmington and Pacoima.</LD>
<TE>   But there are good reasons to be skeptical that a new Valley city
would do even as well. The anti-tax Proposition 13 movement grew in
the Valley, and the political rhetoric there has long been hostile to
tax increases. According to data compiled by the staff of Assemblyman
Robert M. Hertzberg, affluent portions of the Valley voted
substantially below the two-thirds majority needed to approve a 1997
Los Angeles Unified School District bond. Encino, for example, gave
the measure a 55.4% majority, compared with 77.7% in Pacoima. Only
huge majorities south of the Santa Monica Mountains pushed the
measure over two-thirds.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the affluent portion of the Valley has long been a
center of the not-in-my-backyard movement that opposes the sort of
economic development needed to expand the tax base. Valley NIMBYs
even blocked efforts to build Valley sites for the 1984 Summer
Olympics, one of the most upbeat and enjoyable events in L.A.
history.</TE>
<TE>   At the large shopping center at Hayvenhurst Avenue and Ventura
Boulevard in Encino, Bob Rice of Mission Hills was browsing in the
Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore.</TE>
<TE>   Rice, who favors secession, is a community-oriented man. He is a
volunteer for Guide Dogs for the Blind. His wife trains guide dogs. A
Valley resident since 1973, he once was president of the Panorama
City Homeowners Assn. He saw that area change from white middle-class
homeowners to predominantly Latino, with a heavy percentage of
absentee owners, renters and poor people.</TE>
<TE>   "Neighborhoods change very quickly," he said. To Rice, the
phenomenon of rapid change is pushing the affluent Valley to worry
about the poorer Valley. Rich and poor neighborhoods are often not
far apart, he said, and "my problems are right next door."</TE>
<TE>   Secession, he said, would permit the new city to do more for the
Valley's poor. "By having the Valley separate, we can concentrate on
our needs," he said. And the new city could afford it. "All the money
we put in taxes doesn't stay in the Valley."</TE>
<TE>   Rima Kay of Encino, who opposes secession, said, "I don't think
so. They [the poor] would be on the short end of the stick. Where's
the money going to come from?" Or, as man drinking coffee in a nearby
Starbucks put it: "Are you kidding?"</TE>
<TE>   Their skepticism seems justified by the immensity of the task
facing government and private enterprise in rebuilding the oldest,
most rundown parts of the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   I toured the poorest sections of the northeast Valley one morning
with David Gershwin, an aide to City Councilman Alex Padilla, a
secession opponent who represents much of the area. In many places,
there are no sidewalks in front of homes built in the late 1940s and
early '50s. While a lack of sidewalks is a source of community pride
in more-affluent Valley neighborhoods that want to retain touches of
their rural past, in the northeast Valley, the dirt turns to mud and
puddles on rainy days, making it difficult for kids to walk to
school. There is no sidewalk in front of Padilla's house, not far
from where he grew up.</TE>
<TE>   Many streets have no lights. Some houses still have septic tanks.
Auto junkyards extend over acres. There are homes in the shadow of
the Bradley Landfill. Nearby, a dirt road leads past old, run-down
homes. "Encino will have to pay for Pacoima," said Eugene Grigsby,
director of UCLA's Advanced Policy Institute, who is studying
secession's potential effect on Los Angeles County for Supervisor
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Gaines, chairman of the Valley Industry &amp; Commerce Assn., a
major voice for Valley business, said the new city would have the
means for the wealthier areas to subsidize the less fortunate.
"Absolutely," said Gaines, whose organization has not yet taken a
position on secession. "The [Valley] economy has matured to the point
where it can support a city. A generation ago, it was the bedroom
part of the city; now it is not." Secessionist advocate David Fleming
said the new city would have the desire, as well as the means. "The
poor are not being taken care of by Los Angeles," he said. "A lot of
people who live in the hills are more concerned about the poor."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Kyser, senior vice president and chief economist of the Los
Angeles County Economic Development Corp., agreed that the Valley
city would have "a pretty decent economic base." But, he said,
"restoring the poorest part of the city is not cheap, and getting a
buy-in from all the community is not easy."</TE>
<TE>   "This [the new city] will not be a young ingenue like Irvine," he
said. "This city has some miles on it."</TE>
<TE>   Some miles, and the same old L.A. political system of 15 council
districts and a mayor. Most of the votes electing the mayor would
come from affluent areas, just as they do in present-day Los Angeles.
There would be fierce competition for scarce resources. Where, for
example, would the new city find money for a disaster response
operation equal to the splendid job done by Los Angeles firefighters
and police officers during the 1994 earthquake, which hit the Valley
hardest? Raise taxes? Approve big retail developments and auto malls
to bring in sales tax dollars? The Valley's anti-tax history is too
strong for that, as is its NIMBY tradition.</TE>
<TE>   And you can bet that a permanent government of lobbyists,
bureaucrats, campaign consultants and other hangers-on would take
over the new city hall. Actually, the downtown crew would merely
establish branch offices, most likely in fine Ventura Boulevard
office buildings a short drive from Van Nuys City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Valley secessionists should explain just how a government formed
out of this tired old mix would do more for Pacoima and Sun Valley
than the current City Hall has done.</TE>

<AU>SCOTT GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>Scott Gottlieb, a practicing physician, is resident
fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a staff writer for
the British Medical Journal.</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>At the 14th International AIDS Conference last week in Barcelona,
Spain, a leading expert on the disease said everyone with HIV had
"the chance for a normal life."</LD>
<LD>   This unbridled optimism pervades every level of medical care for
the disease, from the top doctors who jet around to international
AIDS meetings like these to the hospital resident on rounds in the
AIDS ward, where young interns are now more afraid of contracting
hepatitis C from needle jabs than HIV because "at least you can treat
HIV," as one recently told me.</LD>
<LD>   This new confidence, born in large measure from a spate of
encouraging news that powerful new classes of AIDS medications are
close at hand, was very much in evidence at this year's AIDS
conference. Much of the buzz stemmed from a radically new class of
drugs called fusion inhibitors. Unlike the 16 previously approved
AIDS drugs, which attack the virus after it enters human cells,
fusion inhibitors erect a barrier outside cells, preventing HIV from
getting inside. If the virus cannot invade or "fuse" with a cell, it
cannot reproduce.</LD>
<TE>   Fusion inhibitors, the first of which could be on the market in
about a year, are a significant breakthrough because they provide
another treatment option for HIV and AIDS patients who have grown
resistant to existing drug combinations. The results of two large
studies unveiled at the conference showed the most advanced of these
new drugs, dubbed T-20, is a potent killer of the virus, especially
strains that had become resistant to all the other medicines.</TE>
<TE>   This has been welcome news to those suffering from AIDS. Nearly a
million people in the United States are estimated to be infected with
HIV, with about 400,000 receiving some form of treatment. And since a
recent study from the University of Alabama showed that the average
patient becomes resistant to front-line therapy within 16 months, and
to second-line therapy in less than a year, T-20 is going to fill an
important need.</TE>
<TE>   But amid all the optimism, it's important to keep one thing in
mind: Life on today's antiretroviral therapy is anything but
"normal." From AZT to protease inhibitors, all the drugs that
patients with HIV take have awful side effects. Those taking them
become nauseated and weak. Many describe it as constantly feeling as
though they have the flu. The drugs also have long-term
complications, causing everything from premature bone loss to heart
disease. My own prescription of a week's worth of antiretroviral
therapy after an on-the-job needle jab (the patient ultimately tested
negative for HIV) left me sick to my stomach and unable to work.</TE>
<TE>   In clinical trials, T-20 has been relatively "clean," devoid of
the nagging side effects that plague some of the other treatments.
But even T-20 needs to be injected twice daily--much the same way
insulin is taken by many diabetics. This is inconvenient, not to
mention painful. And it is anything but normal.</TE>
<TE>   The disconnect between a patient's experiences with the treatments
they are prescribed and a doctor's unbridled confidence in the drugs
stems from a measure of inexperience with what a patient's life is
about. Every doctor is guilty of falling into this deception. In the
hospital, many of my colleagues would not know how to set up the tap
water enemas they routinely order. Few know how to properly insert a
rectal tube. The work schedule is so hectic that few doctors can find
time to administer these things themselves. Regardless of the reason,
the end result is that most doctors not only don't experience the
hardships and indecencies their prescriptions bring; they also don't
witness patients experiencing them.</TE>
<TE>   What is often lost on us is that patients suffer not only from
their disease but also from the treatment. A recent survey found that
many patients failed to properly take their medication because they
could not make sense of the instructions their doctors had given
them. Few drug regimens are as grueling as that for AIDS, which can
require 20 pills a day. One medicine must be taken with meals;
another, on an empty stomach. One needs refrigeration; others do not.
If patients miss doses or vomit up the pills , the virus can mutate
and drug resistance can develop. The protease inhibitors cause some
patients to get skinny arms and legs, distended stomachs and fat
deposits called "buffalo humps" on the upper back.</TE>
<TE>   HIV treatments like T-20 and all the drugs that preceded it are a
miracle for many, and the pace of progress that has been made on this
disease will stand as one of the great achievements of the drug
industry. But the disease is far from cured. The glowing accounts of
wondrous drugs send exactly the wrong message, instilling in most
people a false sense that AIDS is essentially a conquered disease. It
should be of little surprise that there has been a surge in such
risky behavior as unprotected sex and needle-sharing and a
corresponding increase in new HIV infections.</TE>
<TE>   One past study by the CDC found that more than 30% of those at
high risk for contracting HIV said they were less concerned about
AIDS than they had been and were therefore less likely to take
precautions. Many study participants ascribed their renewed
risk-taking to a growing confidence that a cure was close at hand. It
is a confidence bred of false optimism.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors can project confidence not only because they remember an
awful past before antiretroviral drugs were available, but also
because many cannot understand what a life on this therapy--or simply
with a chronic disease--is like. Most doctors treating AIDS are young
and healthy. Their days as patients are far off.</TE>
<TE>   Or are they? In the movie "The Doctor," William Hurt plays a
detached surgeon making neat incisions and small talk with his
patients, until his chronic cough turns out to be throat cancer.
After winding through the hardships and indecencies that he so easily
subjects his own patients to, he learns how scary, humiliating and
infuriating it can be to be a patient.</TE>
<TE>   When he finally returns to his work after being cured of the
disease, he tells all the medical residents who make rounds with him
that they must spend a weekend as a patient, complete with enemas,
bedpans, gauche hospital gowns and plenty of injections. That way
they will understand their prescription pads from the patient's
perspective. This sort of training probably violated some work rules
somewhere, but it is an interesting beginning.</TE>

<KH>RETIREMENT CRISIS</KH>
<HD>Old Age: The New World Threat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. HAMRE and THOMAS W. JONES</AU>
<BD>John J. Hamre is president and chief executive of the
Center for Strategic and International Studies. Thomas W. Jones is
chairman and chief executive of Global Investment Management and
Private Banking Group, Citigroup.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a world trying to deal with terrorism, catastrophic illness,
starvation, drought and nuclear war prevention, old age doesn't seem
terribly threatening.</LD>
<LD>   But during the next three decades, simultaneous aging crises in
Europe, Japan and North America have posed a serious threat to global
stability, with everything from the investment returns on 401(k)
plans to peace and prosperity in the Third World at risk. We can
avert this mega-crisis, but the problem is worse than governments
acknowledge, and time is fast running out.</LD>
<LD>   A recent study by the Center for Strategic and International
Studies (CSIS) and Citigroup found that if developed countries
continued to provide benefits to older citizens at current levels,
government spending on pensions and health benefits would average 30%
of gross domestic product by 2050--twice today's level, and twice the
growth projected in official government estimates.</LD>
<TE>   Why the difference between what governments predict and what is
actually likely? For most countries, the official projections assume
a remarkable turnaround in key demographic and economic trends: more
babies, more working women, much slower growth in health-care costs
and slower growth in life expectancy. Our projections assume that
recent historical trends will continue. If the trend toward longer
lives accelerates, if health-care costs do not slow or if growth
rates falter, government spending will become even more burdensome
than we project.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere is the challenge more serious--or the official projections
more misleading--than in continental Europe, which has the lowest
birthrates, the most generous benefit formulas and the earliest
retirement ages. For the European Union--excluding Scandinavia,
Britain and Ireland--age-related social spending is on track to rise
by an average of 15.9% of GDP, 9% higher than the official
projections. Spain could see its combined health and pension budgets
rise to 37% of GDP by 2050; Greece to 45% of GDP. In France, total
government outlays could eventually absorb two-thirds of national
output.</TE>
<TE>   Nor does the bad news stop there. Our projections show that, by
mid-century, Japan's pension and health budgets could leap by 17.2%
of GDP. Canada's health and pension spending is on track to grow by
17.8% of GDP.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is better off than most other developed countries, but
only by comparison. Social Security spending is likely to rise by
2.8% of GDP by 2050, roughly in line with the official projections.
Spending on Medicare and Medicaid is due to rise by 7.4% of GDP.</TE>
<TE>   The least fiscally challenged developed countries are Australia
and Britain. Their public pension costs will hardly grow at all, due
to reliance on private pensions. Yet, like the rest of the developed
world, they too face looming deficits in their health programs.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is that most developed countries cannot hike taxes--even
to the levels assumed in the official projections--without harming
their economies. Growth rates in Europe and Japan are already
sluggish, due in part to stagnant or shrinking numbers of workers and
consumers--a trend that is only now gathering force. Almost across
the board, their politicians pledge to cut taxes, not raise them. So,
it's unclear how they will they cope with the three-decade-long surge
of baby boomer retirements that will begin later this
decade--particularly when birthrates have dropped dramatically in the
developed world, resulting in fewer people paying into the system at
the other end.</TE>
<TE>   Under a worst-case scenario, the developed world's retirement
crises will combine to deplete global savings and sow upheaval in the
capital markets as default risks multiply among the major economies.
One potential casualty would be growth in the youthful developing
world--where frustrated economic aspirations could produce increased
social turmoil. Instability would also threaten the retirement
savings of Americans, Australians, Britons and others whose private
pensions are a cornerstone of retirement security.</TE>
<TE>   Thankfully, there are signs that governments are beginning to
encourage longer work lives, reduce the cost of unfunded public
benefits and strengthen privately funded alternatives--the three
essential ingredients in a successful strategy. Sweden, Norway, Italy
and Germany have taken initial steps toward reform, including such
things as creating a second tier of funded pensions to make up for
the expected shortfall in contributions, raising retirement ages and
instituting contribution-based benefit plans. Spain, Austria, France,
and Greece lag badly behind. But even in those countries, leaders are
recognizing that government benefit promises will become an economic
burden, a threat to prosperity and, ultimately, a source of
retirement insecurity.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of Britain and Australia, however, none of the
aging developed countries has taken the bold steps necessary to
stabilize pension spending, leaving little room for other
goals--including the inevitable rise in health spending.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge of global aging is everyone's concern--and doing
something about it is everyone's responsibility. Governments must
ensure that today's "generational contracts" are sustainable.
Business must invest more in younger workers and learn to value older
ones. And both must educate the public, which is reluctant to believe
that a system, which worked so well for their parents, can't work for
their children.</TE>
<TE>   Overly optimistic projections have masked the magnitude of the
coming crisis and provided excuses for inaction. Now that the mask is
off, it's time to act, while large postwar boom generations are still
in the work force.</TE>

<AU>PAULA R. NEWBERG</AU>
<BD>Paula R. Newberg recently visited Uzbekistan on behalf
of the National Democratic Institute.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Good news is hard to find in Afghanistan's neighborhood this month.
The exultation in Kabul following the Taliban's fall has given way to
profound insecurity across the country; political change has stalled
in Iran; Pakistan is once again the victim of violence in Afghanistan
and its own self-destructive politics; and some Central Asian
politicians are questioning their relationships with the United
States. These tremors are worrisome signs that U.S. diplomacy in the
region is already overdue for some serious rethinking.</LD>
<LD>   But the logic of diplomacy is not linear. Although the global war
on terrorism appears to have anchored dictatorships across Central
Asia, its secondary effects may turn out to be far more interesting.
Counterintuitive though it may seem, stronger autocracies may be just
the thing to make democracy advocates think about reform.</LD>
<LD>   Consider Uzbekistan, a tidy authoritarian state whose longtime
ruler, Islam Karimov, finessed his transformation from communist to
capitalist--and pariah to partner--by seizing the anti-terrorism high
ground last year to become Washington's closest Central Asian ally.</LD>
<TE>   Uzbekistan--the Silk Road's most famous mileage--is an easy place
to like and a hard place to understand. Its 25 million citizens,
including at least 7,000 political prisoners, have treated their
decade-long independence as an endurance contest. Rather than exploit
economic and political opportunities, most have relied on the state
to ease them through a relatively quiescent post-Soviet period.
Despite its stability, however, Uzbek politics is a study in the
encroachments of fear on public life. Most Uzbeks do not take their
cues from the increasingly vital, if strident, political contests in
neighboring Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. Instead, they have spent 10
years looking south, to their borders with Tajikistan and
Afghanistan, and have seen little but civil war, terror and
heartache.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing the worst, Uzbeks have settled for less than the best.
Karimov has ruled with an iron hand in a climate of constraint,
mocking the feeble efforts of other post-communist rulers to share
power, reform their economies and learn the rules of Western
diplomacy. Instead, he has promoted his doctrine of state-led
development--trickle-up economics, trickle-down social control--and
Uzbeks have allowed him the luxury of manufactured social consensus.
In return, Karimov has abused their rights, limited public debate,
postponed popular political participation and eliminated the critical
middle road that makes trafficking in politics possible.</TE>
<TE>   What irony. The Uzbek inheritors of the Mongol and Timurid
dynasties, whose monuments at Samarkand and Bokhara testify to brutal
medieval tyrannies and astonishingly sophisticated cultures, describe
themselves today as quintessentially "Eastern," passive and
risk-averse. Political parties have been costumes for Karimov's
one-man show, and local government a way to restrain opposition;
newspapers are perpetual irritants to government; and nongovernmental
organizations are either state-owned fictions or political factions
on their way to jail.</TE>
<TE>   That is, until now. Karimov volunteered for the U.S. war on
terrorism and found himself laden with military equipment,
base-leasing agreements and the new embrace of Washington. Like so
much else that has happened since autumn 2001, this was considered
U.S. diplomacy's bitter pill: dance with dictators and live to fight
another terrorist. A formal alliance between the U.S. and Uzbekistan
initiated a tiny trade in diplomatic niceties. To facilitate an
invitation to the U.S., Karimov registered one human rights group
(but didn't re-register dissident political parties); to pursue a
fully fledged military relationship, he fired the government's chief
censor (but didn't necessarily end censorship); in return for
mounting a referendum to extend his rule, he allowed Uzbeks to talk
about democracy.</TE>
<TE>   And that's where things get intriguing. When people talk about
democracy, they often get the itch to do something about it, and some
Uzbeks are doing just that. Parliamentary parties, uncomfortable with
populist inventions like platforms and campaigns, still speak in
empty, ponderous dialectic, but prodded by Karimov, they are slowly
realizing that they'll need plans for the 2004 elections. Government
officials invoke Karimov's words with every breath, but, during the
past year, they have quickly learned the vocabulary of good
governance and are now puzzling over its meaning. NGOs are receiving
a bit more respect and, with the help of foreign interlocutors, have
introduced young Uzbeks to public debate and the delights of
political disagreement. The media are still harassed, but even
proscribed political parties have unfettered Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   Almost everyone who says that things have changed credits the
United States and the U.S.-led anti-terrorism alliance--not by
promoting democracy but by making Karimov feel more secure. This
means that Uzbekistan is still Karimov's, and he plans to keep it
that way. He has loosened the reins of control, but just a little
bit. He has given Uzbeks reason to believe that their lives may
improve, but not reason to think that they can do better without him.
And he has made it clear to everyone that Uzbekistan's potential
democracy relies on the continuing solidarity with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   This is where Karimov wants the United States: responsible for
Uzbekistan's well-being but not in charge. Theoretically, this is
what the U.S. also wants--as long as Uzbek and American interests
coincide. The good news is that everyone, including Karimov, says he
wants democracy. But what happens if Uzbek democrats want new
leaders?</TE>
<TE>   If political reform takes hold in Uzbekistan, expectations will
rise and Uzbeks will find a revolution in the making. But saying yes
to Uzbekistan may mean one day soon saying no to Karimov. That's when
the U.S. will rediscover that allies do not always remain friends.
Most important, the U.S. will relearn that its alliances are made
with countries and their citizens, not with individuals who hold
power. Karimov is surely thinking about this--and so should we.</TE>

<HD>$10 Million Earmarked for Affordable Housing</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors recently approved the
allocation of more than $10 million for the City of Industry Funds
program, giving a boost to 13 affordable-housing programs.</LD>
<LD>   The county's latest allocation, in conjunction with private
funding sources, will provide 500 affordable housing units, including
multifamily developments in Los Angeles, senior housing in Bell,
Santa Fe Springs and Pico Rivera, and single-family housing units in
Willowbrook.</LD>
<LD>   Funding also will go toward an apartment complex for the mentally
ill in Los Angeles and a facility for the developmentally disabled in
Monterey Park, among other programs.</LD>
<TE>   The money for the City of Industry Funds originates from tax
revenue generated from that city's redevelopment areas and can be
used for projects that fall within a 15-mile radius of the city of
Industry. The distribution plan was adopted four years ago by the Los
Angeles Board of Supervisors and is administered by the County
Community Development Commission.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the fund has allocated $75 million--which has leveraged an
additional $400 million in private funding--toward building more than
90 developments, including 3,700 units of affordable and
special-needs housing. The program is scheduled to extend through
2017.</TE>
<TE>   "The Industry Funds are a vital resource that helps the agency
continue its tradition of building better lives and better
neighborhoods," said Carlos Jackson, executive director of the County
Community Development Commission. "Increasing the affordable-housing
stock is an ongoing challenge for the next decade and beyond."</TE>

<HD>Excluding Owner With AIDS Would Pose Problems</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN GLASSMAN and DONIE VANITZIAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I sit on a sub-association board of a common interest
development in California and I have also been on the master board,
so I am an experienced board member. The other boards look to me for
recommendations and value my opinion so I want to make sure on this
before I give my advice.</LD>
<LD>   We have hundreds of expensive homes in this development and
thousands of residents. The development has a couple of swimming
pools, a Jacuzzi and a workout room.</LD>
<LD>   Because we are a strong and long-standing board, we have not had
problems with homeowners until recently. We have just learned that a
homeowner has AIDS. One of the board members has access to this
information firsthand so we know it is true.</LD>
<TE>   We do not want this homeowner or friends of the homeowner to
continue to use the facilities. Is there a nice way to stop them
without making a big deal of this?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: No. As an experienced board member, you know that every
member of the homeowners association is entitled to use the
facilities, subject to reasonable rules and regulations. If your
board attempts to unreasonably deny access to the amenities to a
member who has AIDS, your association will pay the consequences for
such actions.</TE>
<TE>   You state that another board member accessed the "information,"
and therefore you know it to be true. As we understand it, AIDS is a
medical condition and, as such, would be subject to all the privacy
laws relating to disclosure of the condition.</TE>
<TE>   If your board member acquired the information surreptitiously,
that member and possibly your board and the entire association might
be liable in damages for the public disclosure of private
information.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners who purchase in common interest developments understand
they must share the facilities, and bought their homes knowing that.</TE>
<TE>   In attempting to exclude one homeowner, you may have to exclude
anyone with anything as unassuming as the flu, which, after all, can
be spread simply by a sneeze or cough.</TE>
<TE>   Will you then prevent those with tuberculosis and hepatitis from
using the facilities? How will you know for sure who actually has the
diseases you choose to prohibit, and who will make those decisions to
exclude?</TE>
<TE>   Enforcement of a ban would present a host of legal problems, which
your association may not want to risk.</TE>
<TE>   Legality aside, the expense of instituting a method of
determination of such information and then exclusion of certain
individuals may outweigh the costs of the amenities themselves and
the dissension that accompanies it.</TE>
<TE>   Ask your association's attorney if your actions of
discrimination--and disclosure of this individual's medical
condition--will withstand legal challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Absent a legitimate justification, you cannot exclude an owner
from using the facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Educating your members about AIDS, its symptoms and, most
important, how the disease is transmitted, might better serve your
needs.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to prevent this person from exercising his or her rights
to use the facilities can never be done without making it "a big
deal."</TE>

<LD>This Los Feliz home was built in 1964 for Harold Berg, who became
president of Getty Oil Co. in 1976 following the death at 83 of the
company's president, billionaire J. Paul Getty. After Berg sold the
house, it was owned for several years by Laffit Pincay Jr., who at 52
surpassed Bill Shoemaker in 1999 to become thoroughbred racing's
winningest jockey.</LD>
<LD>   About this house: It is in Laughlin Park, a historic gated
community where Cecil B. DeMille, Charlie Chaplin and other film
greats once lived. The half-acre on which the house sits was once

<LD>Sandra Bullock, who co-stars in "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya
Sisterhood" and earlier this year played an FBI profiler in the
thriller "Murder by Numbers," has sold a Hollywood Hills home she
owned for a price in the mid-$700,000s.</LD>
<LD>   The Mediterranean-style house, built in 1925 and recently
renovated, has four bedrooms and two bathrooms in 2,200 square feet.
The house also has patios, balconies and city-to-ocean views.</LD>
<LD>   The home, which was being used as a rental, was purchased by
Katherine Collins Pope, director of development at NBC, and Richard
Edward Robbins, a documentary producer for ABC News who works on the
"Peter Jennings Reporting" series.</LD>
<TE>   The couple, who married in June of last year, are first-time home
buyers. Pope, 29, and Robbins, 31, moved to the L.A. area from the
East Coast three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Bullock, 37, and her sister, Gesine Bullock-Prado, 32, lived in
the home for a time in the early '90s. "The house was lucky for
Sandra. I hope it's lucky for us," Pope said.</TE>
<TE>   The house is one of several owned in the Southland by the actress,
whose primary residence is a stone farmhouse in Austin, Texas. She
also has had homes in Jackson Hole, Wyo., and Tybee Island, Ga. She
purchased a Hollywood Hills home about 18 months ago for about $1.5
million.</TE>
<TE>   Bullock next co-stars with Hugh Grant in the romantic comedy "Two
Weeks' Notice," due out in December.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Ehrlich of Westside Estate Agency, Beverly Hills, handled
the deal, sources said.</TE>

<TE>   The late Jerry Dunphy's Wilshire Boulevard penthouse has come on
the market at $889,000.</TE>
<TE>   Dunphy, one of the most popular news anchors in Los Angeles for
more than 40 years, died in May after suffering a heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   He had lived in his penthouse for about 18 months. The unit, which
was custom designed, has two bedrooms, three baths, a den and a wet
bar.</TE>
<TE>   The condominium is a large corner unit with city, mountain and
ocean views, which, though wide-ranging, don't quite live up to
Dunphy's trademark line, "From the desert to the sea to all of
Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   The unit is in an 18-story building, which has a pool, gym, valet
parking, security and a receptionist.</TE>
<TE>   Dunphy's estate is selling the penthouse. It is not a probate
sale.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of his death, Dunphy, who was at least 80, was one of
the main anchors at KCAL-TV Channel 9. Dunphy was single but had been
married twice and had six children.</TE>
<TE>   Natalie Janger has the listing with Wendy Yarbrough, Dunphy's
granddaughter. Both are with DBL Beverly Hills.</TE>

Brent Baum for about $1.8 million. Built in 1927, the Spanish-style
home has six bedrooms in more than 3,000 square feet. There is a main
house, three guest houses, a pool and a spa. The home, which was also
for lease at $10,000 a month, is on a half-acre with sprawling lawns.</TE>
<TE>   Bellwood and Wheeler, who departed from their 1985 marriage
ceremony in Nepal on an elephant, have traveled extensively and have
documented, through his photos and her writing, elephant roundups in
Thailand and tribal life in Burma.</TE>
<TE>   Bellwood, probably best known for playing Claudia Blaisdel in the
'80s TV series "Dynasty," appeared in the TV special "Dynasty: The E!
True Hollywood Story" (2001) and the independent film "Shopping"
(2001), the third feature in filmmaker Henry Jaglom's "women
trilogy," which began with "Eating" (1990) and "Babyfever" (1994).
Bellwood also was in the movies "The Incredible Shrinking Woman"
(1981) and "Airport '77" (1977), in which she played Jimmy Stewart's
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Baum is executive producer of the upcoming movie "Buying the Cow,"
and he was executive producer of the 2000 films "Beautiful" and
"Thomas and the Magic Railroad."</TE>
<TE>   Jana Jones-Duffy and Fred Holley of Coldwell Banker, Beverly
Hills, had the listing; Jeanne Murray of Coldwell Banker, Hancock
Park, represented the buyer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Internationally known artist Hiro Yamagata has sold his home in
Malibu for about $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Yamagata purchased the home in 1990 for $2.3 million. Built in
1975, the house has four bedrooms and seven baths in slightly more
than 5,800 square feet, according to public records. The house is on
an acre facing the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Yamagata redesigned and updated the interiors, installing
limestone floors and a granite pool, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The artist recently created three large paintings for the first
major expansion and refurbishing of Kushiyu, the popular, 15-year-old
Japanese restaurant in Tarzana. The expansion--with Yamagata's
vibrant, 7-by-5-foot paintings--was completed this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, Yamagata had a show in New York in which he used
spotlights, fiber optics, strobe lights and lasers to turn the
25,000-square-foot Ace Gallery into what was described as a "trippy
digital wonderland." In June, he covered another New York gallery
with holographic panels while white laser beams were refracted into a
spectrum of colors.</TE>

<TE>   Chinese painter Ting Shao Kuang, who had one of his Beverly Hills
homes on the market earlier this year at $18.8 million, has sold a
smaller Beverly Hills home that he owns for a price in the $4-million
range, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The artist had thought about selling the larger home but decided,
instead, to move there and sell the smaller home, a European-style
villa in the flats of Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   He had owned the smaller home, with five bedrooms in nearly 10,000
square feet, since 1991, a year after it was built.</TE>
<TE>   His larger house has 12 bedrooms in 37,000 square feet. It was
completed in 1990. Ting has owned it since 1995 but only recently
moved into it after completing a refurbishing.</TE>
<TE>   Ting, in his early 60s, moved to the United States in 1980 after
becoming the leader of the Yunnan School of Art, which combines early
20th century European line art, watercolor and oil with motifs from
Balinese, Thai and Chinese folk and tribal themes.</TE>
<TE>   His works now sell for more than $500,000 each. He painted a mural
for the Great Hall of the People in Beijing that is regarded as one
of the wonders of modern art.</TE>
<TE>   Raymond Bekeris of John Bruce Nelson &amp; Associates represented Ting
in his house sale.</TE>

<DH>The actress known as Elvira has set aside much of her
memorabilia for a home that's light and cheery, even at midnight</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUTH RYON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home life for Cassandra Peterson is more "Leave It to Beaver" than
"The Addams Family" since she sold her Los Feliz house to Brad Pitt a
few years ago and moved next door.</LD>
<LD>   "We went Elvira-crazy in our old home," she said, referring to her
role as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, star of the new gothic-horror
comedy film "Elvira's Haunted Hills."</LD>
<LD>   Elvira products and memorabilia filled the Craftsman-style house
Pitt bought in 1994. Built for an oil baron in 1910 and known as
Briarcliff Manor, the 5,600-square-foot house, which Pitt still owns,
has dark-wood-and-copper walls.</LD>
<TE>   Now Peterson is a seeker of light in the four-bedroom,
3,800-square-foot home that she bought in 1995 for $800,000 with her
manager-husband, Mark Pierson.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in the middle of redecorating to get more of a light and
cheery look," she said.</TE>
<TE>   They already took out a wall to make a stairway airier and added
wainscoting, ceiling moldings and French doors to the French New
Orleans-style home, which was built in 1939.</TE>
<TE>   The house, behind a jasmine-draped, wrought-iron fence, is among
36 built about the same time in a canyon still populated by coyotes
and deer. The homes became a gated community in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   One of the older features in the house is a wet bar behind some
wall paneling that Peterson calls "a secret bar."</TE>
<TE>   Newer features are a pool and a playhouse, which Peterson and
Pierson put in the backyard.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I got the playhouse for myself," Peterson said, "because
our daughter, who is nearly 8, doesn't use it that much."</TE>
<TE>   Peterson added a foundation, new roof and electricity to the
secondhand playhouse she was given. "So we got a free playhouse for
$5,000."</TE>
<TE>   Miniature pink roses cover the playhouse, which is next to a small
vegetable garden where Peterson grows tomatoes, basil and other
herbs.</TE>
<TE>   "We eat mostly vegetarian," she said. "We were vegetarians for
eight years and then we fell off the wagon when I got pregnant and
had cravings for chicken and dumplings."</TE>
<TE>   Peterson likes to cook, but her kitchen isn't remarkable, her
husband said. "We have no big freezers, no granite counters. We
didn't even remodel the kitchen. All we did was paint it. So it's not
opulent, but it is comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Peterson learned to cook in Italy, where she lived after
graduating from high school in Colorado. Prior to moving to Italy,
she performed as one of the youngest showgirls in Las Vegas. While in
Italy, she joined a rock band for about a year as its lead singer and
had a part in the 1972 movie "Fellini's Roma."</TE>
<TE>   After she left Italy, she became a member of the L.A.-based comedy
group the Groundlings and appeared in supporting roles on such series
as "Happy Days" and "St. Elsewhere." She married Pierson 21 years ago
and shortly after became a horror-movie host on the former KHJ-TV in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Elvira was born, and through the TV show "Movie Macabre" she
became nationally syndicated as a horror-film host in 1983, with her
show playing in syndication until 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Pierson and Peterson then marketed and licensed Elvira for more
than 350 products--"from perfume to beer," he said. Among the newest
are an Elvira slot machine and an Elvira electric guitar. Pierson, a
former professional musician, is a guitarist.</TE>
<TE>   The couple still have an Elvira pinball machine in their den, and
other Elvira influences such as a Rottweiler named Mina for a
character in Bram Stoker's 1897 novel "Dracula," and three cats:
Renfield, from "Dracula," and Jekyll and Hyde, from the 1886 tale by
Robert Louis Stevenson, "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde."</TE>
<TE>   In making their current home less Elvira-like, they put many of
their products in storage and moved others, along with some Elvira
memorabilia, to Pierson's office in a five-unit, 1936 apartment
building in Hollywood. The couple bought the building with profits
from the first Elvira movie, "Elvira, Mistress of the Dark."</TE>
<TE>   The 1988 movie also made it possible for the couple to buy a 1958
Thunderbird, which they call a "macabre mobile." The black
convertible has a silver hood ornament resembling Elvira and grill
ornaments that look like eyeballs with claws. The car twice has been
on exhibit at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Welcome to Elvira World," Pierson said, entering his Hollywood
office, where there is a large photo/oil painting of Elvira; framed
fake fingernails with Elvira's likeness painted on them as entries in
a contest from about a dozen fingernail artists; and a large portrait
of the late actor Vincent Price, a friend of the couple.</TE>
<TE>   "Elvira's Haunted Hills," which parodies classic Vincent Price and
Roger Corman-directed Edgar Allan Poe films of the early '60s, is
dedicated to Price. It is also being released in memory of actor Phil
Hartman, whom Peterson knew from the Groundlings. The film opened to
sellout crowds the July 5 weekend at the Laemmle Fairfax Cinemas,
where it will continue an unlimited run on Fridays and Saturdays at
midnight.</TE>
<TE>   To make the new movie, Pierson and Peterson mortgaged their house
and their apartment building for $1 million and obtained some funds
from his parents. Pierson described the retired couple as "kingpins
of real estate" in Malibu, where they were known for buying, fixing
and selling homes.</TE>
<TE>   "I buy and hold," said Pierson, who grew up in Malibu Colony and
keeps a surfboard in his office.</TE>
<TE>   The silver-haired surfer and blue-eyed redhead are betting on
"Elvira's Haunted Hills" to keep their real estate afloat.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson is stepping out from behind her black wig, heavy makeup
and low-cut, high-slit dress to help promote the film, which she
co-wrote with longtime writing partner John Paragon. The movie
co-stars Richard O'Brien, who wrote music and lyrics for "The Rocky
Horror Picture Show" (1975), in which he also starred.</TE>
<TE>   "We capped off her 20th anniversary as Elvira with the movie,
which we made last year in Transylvania [Romania]," said Pierson, who
is the producer and plays a butler in the film. "We need to travel a
lot to promote the movie as we have no film studios behind us."</TE>
<TE>   So far, he figures that through their appearances and pre-release
screenings, they have helped to raise about $400,000 for AIDS
charities. The couple also has been promoting their new movie at film
festivals and horror/sci-fi conventions.</TE>
<TE>   At 50, Peterson says she's not yet thinking of retiring Elvira, no
matter how uncomfortable the costume, with its high heels and cinched
waist, but she is looking ahead to doing cartoon voice work, writing
an autobiography and maybe going to a Halloween party as something
other than the Mistress of the Dark.</TE>
<TE>   "I always had the best costumes as a child, but now, it seems, I'm
stuck with one for life," she said. "I wish I could wear another
costume someday."</TE>
<TE>   That day has already come in Los Feliz. Now when she's at home,
she's more like June Cleaver than Morticia Addams.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "When in Doubt, Disclose" by Allison B. Cohen (June 23):
Last year we were forced to move and sell our condo. Even though the
reason caused great controversy, I believed a special disclosure was
an absolute necessity.</LD>
<LD>   I have asthma, and any amount of tobacco smoke will cause severe
attacks. When we were looking for a condo to purchase, we thought to
check only that particular unit. We were unaware that tobacco smoke
infiltrates and fills every adjoining unit to that of the smoker.</LD>
<LD>   After a year of fighting and realizing our association was not
willing to enforce the nuisance clause, my husband and I were forced
to move. When I discovered that this happens often, I insisted that
we sign a disclosure statement in case potential buyers had a
respiratory or heart problem, a child with asthma or might be
pregnant or have an infant. Our real estate agent's manager agreed
that it was a wonderful idea.</LD>
<TE>   My conscience was clear when the buyer signed the disclosure, and
I knew she had been advised of the potential health risks.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding "Apartments Open for Mentally Disabled" by Diane Wedner
(June 23):</LD>
<LD>   Despite the budget shortfalls in virtually every sector of
government, the spending spree continues unabated.</LD>
<LD>   In another blatant example of government waste and overspending, I
read that 29 units of studio apartments have been completed in L.A.
at a cost of $3 million. While this project is undoubtedly
well-intentioned, dividing the cost by the number of units
constructed yields a per-unit cost of $103,448, an absurdly high
figure for a studio unit.</LD>
<TE>   Wouldn't it make more sense to simply subsidize needy tenants? A
studio apartment can be rented today for, say, $650 per month. If all
29 tenants were given a $300-per-month subsidy, they would be paying
only around $350 per month from their resources. This would cost
taxpayers only about $140,000 per year.</TE>
<TE>   The government would be relieved of rent losses, maintenance and
management responsibilities--generally major costs of running public
housing. These would be shouldered by the private, tax-paying sector,
and the $3 million would stretch further.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Secession's Impact on Homes" by Diane Wedner (June 30):
Let the renting public know that if the Valley secedes, renters will
no longer have the protection of rent control. The property owners
don't want the renters to know that.</LD>
<LD>   Alert the public that they may lose their rights as renters. I,
for one, would have to move to another state if that were to happen.
I also don't know how anyone these days can afford to pay $1,000 to
$1,600 for a one-bedroom apartment. It's appalling.</LD>

<LD>Regarding "Lender Refuses to Accept Appraisal" (Real Estate Q&amp;A, by
Robert J. Bruss, June 30): The buyers stated that they "would pay
$5,000 more than any legitimate, competitive bid" and that they were
in a "competitive bidding situation." Based on the information
provided, concluding that the low appraisal was bad and the high
appraisal was good is absurd.</LD>
<LD>   Was the appraiser hired by the buyers approved by the lender? Did
they expect the lender to just accept an appraisal from an appraiser
without first verifying the quality of his or her work?</LD>
<LD>   There are too many appraisers (and Realtor-brokers) who will tell
you whatever you want to hear to generate business and get paid.
There aren't many appraisers who will risk losing future business
with a low appraisal unless it is very supportable.</LD>
<TE>   Bruss is right that bad appraisals were and are a problem when
they are based on "making the deal" and not on market value.</TE>

<KH>Home Buyer Make-Over</KH>
<HD>Credit Problems Delay Family's Dream</HD>
<DH>The fallout from a series of setbacks caused their home
lender to back out. So an L.A. couple is now making a clean report
their top priority.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLISON B. COHEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Homeownership was a mere two weeks away for Angelo and Kathy Bell and
their two daughters when their lender--whom they had found through
the Internet--backed out.</LD>
<LD>   The reason? Bad credit.</LD>
<LD>   Angelo and Kathy had a string of late payments, some accounts that
had gone into collection and a car repossessed in 1998. Now all of
that would have to be cleaned up, including payment of the $7,000
debt on the car to a financing company, before they could be approved
by the lender.</LD>
<TE>   "Our [loan] has been denied," said Angelo, 37, an information
technology manager, halting what was to be a 38-day escrow on a
$179,990 home in Moreno Valley. Kathy's dream of moving out of their
880-square-foot Miracle Mile apartment into a 1,734-square-foot home
with generous closet space is now on hold.</TE>
<TE>   And Angelo's desire to provide a spacious home for Kathy and
daughters Israel, 2, and Cimone, 15 months--complete with a family
room, a den and a formal dining room so they could host Christmas for
the extended family this year--will have to wait.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have to regroup," Angelo said, "and try and look
at this from a new perspective."</TE>
<TE>   The Bells are still reeling from a time shortly after they were
married in 1996 when they both lost their jobs. Consequently, after
Angelo's severance pay ran out, bills went unpaid and debts started
to add up.</TE>
<TE>   Around this time, their 1992 Mercury Sable was repossessed. A few
months later, even after they both got on their feet, Kathy, who was
pregnant with their first child, was in a car accident that resulted
in bed rest and her going on disability. Again, the budget was tight,
as the couple lost Kathy's $28,000 annual salary.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have a plan," Angelo said. "We would think about
savings, but then something would always come up."</TE>
<TE>   But in the last few years, as the Bells have apartment-hopped to
find more space for their growing family, they have made attempts to
restore their credit--hoping they could clean it up enough to trade
in apartment living for homeownership.</TE>
<TE>   About 1 1/2 years ago, Angelo started tackling the old debt--one
bill at a time. He started sending out letters--more than a dozen--to
agencies asking for time to repay old bills. In fact, the couple
thought they were starting to make financial progress--so much so
that they decided to live on Angelo's $61,000 annual gross income and
have Kathy stay at home with the kids.</TE>
<TE>   They even managed to save $6,000--money they had hoped could be
used toward a down payment on a home. Finally, they thought they were
emotionally and financially ready for homeownership.</TE>
<TE>   Through savvy use of the Internet, the Bells explored different
neighborhoods in the Greater Los Angeles area and learned they could
afford their dream home in Moreno Valley--even though it would mean
up to three hours of daily commuting for Angelo, whose job is in
Marina del Rey.</TE>
<TE>   They also found a real estate agent online, and soon the
couple--with a letter of conditional approval from a lender--were
touring houses.</TE>
<TE>   They found one they loved, made an offer and, on one giddy Friday
afternoon, learned they had gotten the house.</TE>
<TE>   But 2 1/2 weeks into escrow, and after further review, the lender
backed out, saying that the Bells would be too much of a risk.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Bells must find a way to clean up their credit
report--including some items they are disputing and say should be
removed--and repay the $7,000 debt on the car, which could set the
couple back months or more. And they will certainly lose the house
they loved. But all is not lost for the Bells.</TE>
<TE>   "There is hope for Angelo and Kathy," according to Jennifer
Livingston, a 22-year expert in the mortgage banking business and
vice president and regional sales manager of Union Bank of
California. But, she added, homeownership may take time. "If [they]
dream of owning a home," she said, "then the patience will really be
worth it."</TE>
<TE>   Although a quick fix for the Bells might be to continue searching
out a lender willing to make them a loan, Livingston recommended
against that.</TE>
<TE>   "There is someone out there today that would be willing to make
them a loan," but at a cost, she said. Consumers who are considered
higher risk to lenders have to make up that deficit with a loan that
is not very attractive, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Loans such as these, according to Livingston, can be offered at
much higher interest rates, require more points for closing and may
have to be refinanced in a few years. Other options offer manageable
adjustable rates to start, and then may jump as much as three
percentage points a year, quickly becoming a financial hardship.</TE>
<TE>   "For someone who is just trying to buy a new home, this is an
exorbitant way to do so," Livingston said. "These types of loans will
certainly drain any savings the Bells have had" and make purchasing
necessities like carpeting, furniture or appliances nearly
impossible, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Livingston recommended the Bells continue to improve
their credit history, paying off debt as they can. In the meantime,
she said, they must remain current for two years on their
bills--meaning they can never miss or be late on any payments.</TE>
<TE>   She also suggested they put some money into savings, even if it is
nominal. "It's these little steps that take time," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She recommended the Bells continue to monitor their credit report.
The couple has discovered that some debt can inadvertently show up
twice, and that items--once paid--can be very slow in coming off.</TE>
<TE>   "[Collection] agencies are not too speedy to report [debt
payments] to credit bureaus," she said.</TE>
<TE>   After the rejection, the Bells may have felt alone with their debt
problem, but experts say they are not alone. According to Dianne
Wilkman, president and chief executive officer of Springboard, a
nonprofit consumer credit-counseling service in Southern California,
a bad credit history is the No. 1 reason applicants are denied home
loans in the Greater Los Angeles area.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Wilkman estimates that about a quarter of local
applicants vying for a conventional home loan are denied due to bad
credit.</TE>
<TE>   "Overconsumption is a factor," she said, "but so are other reasons
like divorce, medical issues and a lack of health insurance ... [and]
the cost of living in Southern California is so high, that puts a
strain on family budgets."</TE>
<TE>   Wilkman said people may start to charge unpaid bills to their
credit cards just to make ends meet, adding to their debt.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkman recommended the Bells consider counseling with
Springboard, which has 35 walk-in locations in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't wave a wand and turn bad credit into A credit," she
said, "but we ... give people the tools to get back in control."</TE>
<TE>   Now the Bells are trying to get over losing the house they loved.
"Next time around," Angelo said, "we'll know more of what we're
doing. We'll be ready for this."</TE>
<TE>   But there may be an additional benefit for the Bells, especially
in today's record-breaking seller's market. "They can get their
credit cleaned up," said Livingston of Union Bank, "while they wait
for home prices to stabilize."</TE>

<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   This Month's Home-Buyer Make-Over</TE>
<TE>   Home buyers: Angelo, 37, and Kathy Bell, 29.</TE>
<TE>   Occupations: Angelo is a manager of information technology for a
public relations company; Kathy is a stay-at-home mother.</TE>
<TE>   Gross annual income: $61,000.</TE>
<TE>   Goal: To buy a first home with the feel of a big family home--even
though it may mean relocating to the Inland Empire, far from Angelo's
Marina del Rey workplace.</TE>
<TE>   The problem: While Angelo and Kathy have worked hard over the last
1 1/2 years to clean up some bad credit, their credit score is still
poor and an auto repossession is still outstanding, making it
difficult to get a loan. The Bells have already found the house of
their dreams in Moreno Valley, which they likely will not be able to
buy.</TE>
<TE>   Recommendations</TE>
<TE>   * Stay away from loans with extremely high interest rates, points
or quick payback schedules even if it means they can get into the
home now.</TE>
<TE>   * Contact the three main credit bureaus (TransUnion, Equifax and
Experian) to receive a complete, up-to-date credit report and slowly
start tackling each item on the report. Contact the creditor directly
to set up a payment plan or to pay off each debt one at a time.</TE>
<TE>   * Carefully scrutinize the credit report to make sure that some
collections haven't been listed twice and to ensure paid accounts
have been removed.</TE>
<TE>   * Repay any repossessions--or negotiate to pay a percent of the
amount owed--to have that removed from the credit report or corrected
to reflect that it has been paid.</TE>
<TE>   * Maintain perfect current credit (meaning no late payments or
collections) for at least 24 months before applying for a loan.</TE>
<TE>   * While whittling down debt, put something into savings--even if
it is a few hundred dollars a month.</TE>
<TE>   * Most items stay on a credit report for seven years, but
negotiate to have the items removed sooner, in some cases, once they
are paid.</TE>
<TE>   * Consider financial counseling from an organization such as
Springboard, a nonprofit offering services from debt management
strategies to pre- and post-homeownership counseling. Counseling is
free, with some specialized services for a nominal fee. Help is
available on the Web, www.credit.org, or call (888) 462-2227.</TE>

<HD>Manager Is Not Required to Reveal the Owner's Name</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Project Sentinel</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: The resident manager at my apartment complex is very slow
at scheduling repairs. I've asked for the name and telephone number
of the property owner, but she will not give it to me. What can I do?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: As long as there is a manager on the premises, there is no
legal requirement for the manager to reveal the name and/or telephone
number of a property owner. As long as a tenant has contact
information for a manager or property supervisor, an owner has
fulfilled his or her legal obligation.</LD>
<LD>   Property ownership is public record and is available from your
county assessor's office. In some cases, the owner's address on title
at the county assessor's office is the same as the property address,
but you will still be able to learn the owner's name. You have the
right to contact the property owner.</LD>

<TE>   Disabled Person Can Seek Change in Rent Due Date</TE>
<TE>   Q: I'm permanently disabled and my rent is due on the first of
each month. Because my disability check doesn't arrive until the
fifth of each month, I live in fear each month that the rent check
will clear the bank before my disability funds are available.</TE>
<TE>   The landlord is not willing to hold my rent check for a few days
to ensure the check is good. Is there something I can do?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes. Your local fair housing agency can help you request a
"reasonable accommodation" for payment of rent.</TE>
<TE>   A reasonable accommodation is a protection that individuals with
either a physical or mental disability have under federal and state
fair housing laws. It is a request to your housing provider to make
an exception to their normal policy because of your disability.</TE>
<TE>   In your case, you would ask the landlord to accommodate your
disability by allowing you to pay the rent on the fifth or sixth of
each month because your sole source of income is your disability
payment.</TE>
<TE>   A reasonable accommodation cannot pose an administrative or
financial hardship on housing providers. If the landlord can prove
one or both of the hardships, the denial is allowed. But if there is
no hardship, the landlord could face a more serious financial burden
if discrimination can be proved.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Applicant in Wheelchair Didn't Get a Fair Chance</TE>
<TE>   Q: One of my tenants brought a friend to apply for a vacancy. The
available unit is on the second floor, but the prospective tenant is
disabled and uses a wheelchair. Because putting in an elevator would
be too expensive, I did not accept the application, saying the unit
had been rented. Was I wrong?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes. You are in direct violation of state and federal fair
housing laws. These laws state that it is discriminatory to
misrepresent the availability of a unit because of the presence, or
perception, of a disability.</TE>
<TE>   Just because the prospective tenant uses a wheelchair does not
mean you have to install an elevator. The disabled person may not be
permanently confined to the wheelchair or may use it as a support
mechanism when experiencing muscle fatigue.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the situation, you should not deny disabled individuals
the opportunity to obtain housing because of an assumption, without
investigating the facts. A disabled tenant should be given the
opportunity to consider all available units as long as he or she
meets your screening criteria based on legitimate business concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Individuals with disabilities have the same rights as able-bodied
people seeking housing. When you discriminate, you, as well as the
property owner, may be subject to a costly lawsuit or an
investigation by a local, state or federal fair housing agency. To
become better informed about fair housing laws, contact your local
fair housing office.</TE>

<LD>No decorative surface is more colorful or interesting than ceramic

<LD>   Although commercial grout cleaners are available at stores, it is
easier and less expensive to use common household products to do the
job.</LD>
<LD>   For colored grout, vinegar works wonders--either straight or in
strong solution with water.</LD>
<TE>   Some people find that household bleach does the job.</TE>

<HD>Bringing Baby? Lighten Load by Renting Gear</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's nothing like parenthood to make you nostalgic for the
carefree travel of your college years. Back then, I frequently
arrived at the airport at the last minute, sprinting to the gate with
all my gear stuffed into a single carry-on bag.</LD>
<LD>   And now? I practically need a Mack truck to transport my precious
18-month-old's "essentials" for a one-week vacation.</LD>
<LD>   On one sad day at the Detroit airport last fall, I learned the
hard way that I cannot simultaneously push my lightweight stroller
and pull a large rolling bag, especially when both shoulders are
loaded with tote bags filled with toys, jars of baby food, utensils,
bottles, nipples, diapers, wipes, a change of clothes, a blanket and
medicine.</LD>
<TE>   I decided then that I would find a way to travel light, even with
a young child in tow.</TE>
<TE>   To my delight, I learned that you can rent much of the baby gear
you need in most major cities--not just cribs and highchairs, but
also small things like baby monitors and toys. Toys!</TE>
<TE>   You can even arrange to have the goods delivered to wherever
you're staying before you arrive and picked up after you leave.</TE>
<TE>   I tried out the rental route during a May trip to San Francisco
and Portland, Ore., and it was a divine luxury--but one I would use
sparingly.</TE>
<TE>   The baby and I shared a medium-size rolling suitcase filled with
our clothes, shoes and toiletries that was only slightly larger than
the suitcase my husband hogged for himself. We checked both of those.</TE>
<TE>   I also packed one tote bag with two toys, a snack, a sippy cup,
diapering supplies and my purse. My husband carried a second tote bag
with the video camera and other valuables. He also carried the baby's
car seat, the only piece of baby gear we could not avoid because we
needed it for the cab ride to the airport.</TE>
<TE>   No stroller. No portable highchair. No portable baby bathtub. No
bedrails. No portable playpens. No baby monitor. No stair gates. No
suitcase full of toys. In short, none of the heavy, bulky stuff that
had been so unwieldy on past trips to visit family and friends.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the airport was manageable.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting for us when we arrived at our (single and childless)
friend's four-story loft in San Francisco were a full-size Peg Perego
Prima Pappa highchair, a Baby Trend jogging stroller, Safety First
stair gates and bathtub, Fisher-Price Bounce 'n Play playpen, baby
monitor and bedrails, and a plastic storage tub filled with
age-appropriate toys (classic and high-tech), all delivered by
Littleluggage, a San Francisco-based company that specializes in
renting baby equipment. Everything was either new or new enough, and
impeccably clean.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: $255, including delivery and pickup.</TE>
<TE>   It was worth every dime.</TE>
<TE>   The portable baby gear we would otherwise have lugged typically
isn't as sturdy or comfortable as mid-range or top-of-the-line
models. My portable highchair wouldn't have worked in my friend's
apartment at all. It's essentially a hammock seat on a metal frame
that attaches to a table, and my friend's small antique dining table
had no lip on which to attach the contraption.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the rest of the stuff would have been a drag, and buying
duplicate items seems wasteful, although Ericka Lutz, author of
several parenting books (including "On the Go With Baby"), suggested
that one option would have been to buy inexpensive items at a
children's secondhand store, then donate them back. But she agrees
that it is an investment in time over money.</TE>
<TE>   When Lutz traveled with her daughter, she occasionally took used
goods, but more often she simply made do. "Part of it is stripping
down to what you need," she said. "Some of it you can just do
without."</TE>
<TE>   "People for centuries have raised babies with very little gear,"
she added. "You don't need a highchair. If the child is old enough,
he can sit on telephone books. You don't need a baby bath. You can
bathe a child in the sink."</TE>
<TE>   OK, I could have done without some of the things I rented, but it
was nice to have all the comforts of home.</TE>
<TE>   The stroller we rented was the same brand, model and color as the
one we use at home. We took the baby for walks two and even three
times a day, and he loved the novelty of strolling in a bustling city
rather than the quiet suburb where we live.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing we didn't use much was the playpen--I had to use it
just once for a few minutes during the five days we spent in San
Francisco--but I had rented it merely as insurance. I wanted a 100%
secure place for the baby while I made him a meal, for example,
considering my friend's description of his new apartment: "Some of
the stairs don't have drops, they just float," he told me during one
telephone call. "Is that a problem?"</TE>
<TE>   Luckily, it wasn't quite the death trap I had envisioned.</TE>
<TE>   And although I would rent again under similar circumstances, on
many trips I wouldn't need as much equipment. For example, I doubt
that rented baby gear would be necessary at a vacation resort, where
you're typically eating in restaurants or at poolside and where the
hotel would have highchairs.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Ed Lynch, president of Littleluggage, said rentals by
parents staying in hotels make up about 40% of his business. He
attributes this partly to media reports about the dangers of small,
low-end hotel cribs.</TE>
<TE>   I also wouldn't rent on visits to close relatives who have the
space to store baby equipment. My parents, for instance, bought a
highchair and a crib in anticipation of our visit last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Visiting friends with kids also can make rentals and portable gear
mostly unnecessary. During the Portland leg of our recent trip, we
rented a shorter list of gear--highchair, stroller and bedrails for
$78, delivery and pickup included--from Babies On-the-Go Rentals, a
small Oregon rental company.</TE>
<TE>   Even that turned out to be mostly unnecessary: Our friends have
two young boys and provided a highchair and stroller. We would still
have needed the bedrails for our three-day stay, and the cost, $27,
would have been well worth the convenience, and cheaper than buying
new ones and leaving them behind.</TE>
<TE>   Which was at least one lesson learned: Don't be seduced by the
novelty. Once you've decided to rent, don't get carried away with
add-ons. Those few dollars per day per item certainly add up.</TE>

<LD>Whether to rent baby gear on a trip depends on many factors,
including your family needs and budget, the kind of trip you're
taking and where you're headed. Some tips:</LD>
<LD>   * Focus on what you absolutely need and would gladly pay not to
have to drag through an airport.</LD>
<LD>   * Check with friends, relatives or your resort, hotel or cruise
line to find out what equipment they have available.</LD>
<TE>   * Ask the rental company you're considering about the brands, age
and condition of the equipment, the methods and frequency of cleaning
the equipment, and whether they stay on top of product recalls.
You'll find you're dealing primarily with small businesses--some of
which are run out of private homes--so quality may vary.</TE>
<TE>   Baby equipment rentals:</TE>
<TE>   A Web site compiled by an anonymous volunteer lists baby gear
rental companies in 28 U.S. states (including Hawaii) and some
foreign destinations, including Australia, Canada, France and
Britain: www.hometown.aol.com/cribrental. I used this site to find
the rental companies I tried.</TE>
<TE>   The American Rental Assn.'s Web site offers a search engine that
lists member baby gear companies at selected destinations:
www.rentalhq.com. Click on "find a rental store," type in your
destination city and state or ZIP Code, then click on "find specific
products." A list will pop up; choose the "baby equipment" category.</TE>
<TE>   Baby's Away is a baby supply rental franchise operating in 30
locations in 15 states; (800) 571-0077, www.babiesaway.com.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco I used Little- luggage, (877) FLY-BABY
(359-2229), fax (501) 694-0877, www.littleluggage.com. The company
also has a branch in Los Angeles and plans to open another this month
in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   In Portland, Ore., I used Babies On-the-Go Rentals, (888) 677-BABY
(2229), fax (503) 246-3502, www.rent4baby.com.</TE>
<TE>   Other Web sites that suggest rental companies are www.about.com
(search for "baby equipment") and www.tinytravelers.net. If you can't
find a company at your destination, try a party supply rental store.
Some of these companies rent a limited selection of baby items.</TE>
<TE>   For the truly decadent, Baby Travel Solutions delivers disposable
diapers (sample: $18.50 for 40 Huggies Ultra Trim newborn size),
formula, baby food, wipes, snacks and care kits with baby shampoo and
soap, anywhere in the country; (888) 989-0302, fax (303) 428-7479,
www.babytravelsolutions.com.</TE>
<TE>   Parents who use cloth diapers should call ahead to a diaper
service at their destination. Many of them will agree to short-term
service of a week or two as a courtesy.</TE>

<HD>All That Glitters Is Still Found in Hong Kong</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five years ago this month, Great Britain returned Hong Kong to the
Chinese government. It seems only yesterday that the world anxiously
awaited the change: What would happen to this glittering city on the
South China Sea?</LD>
<LD>   As it turned out, not much.</LD>
<LD>   Eternally hitched to the star that is the Asian market, Hong Kong,
now part of a Special Administrative Region of China, has continued
to thrive, albeit with decreasing rights to democratic elections and
free speech.</LD>
<TE>   In early June the city held its annual Victoria Park vigil in
honor of the anniversary of the massacre at Tiananmen Square--but
with thinner crowds than ever and amid warnings from Hong Kong's
Chinese masters that next year the protest will be banned.</TE>
<TE>   Although the mainland city of Shanghai is eclipsing Hong Kong as
China's cash cow, there are still signs that the former British
holding will continue to be a powerhouse.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the city's densely packed Central District is being
gradually overshadowed by what will be Hong Kong's tallest
skyscraper, the 88-story Two International Finance Centre, to be
completed next year.</TE>
<TE>   For tourists, Hong Kong is more expensive than many cities in
Asia. The U.S. dollar is permanently linked to the Hong Kong
currency, eliminating the chance that tourists will enjoy windfalls
from improved exchange rates. And some of the priciest real estate on
Earth makes daily costs there far above standard Asian prices: Rooms
at major hotels are geared to business travelers and can cost more
than $300 a night.</TE>
<TE>   But Hong Kong is still worth a visit, and its multicultural
wonders can be yours for a song if you know where to stay. The city
hosts what might be the best budget lodging in the world: the
Salisbury YMCA, 011-852-2268-7000, www.ymcahk.org.hk, across Victoria
Harbour on the leading edge of Kowloon.</TE>
<TE>   Forget what you expect of Y accommodations. The Salisbury is as
plush as a luxury hotel--three phones in each room, daily paper,
fruit basket, room service, two restaurants, a pool, beauty
salon--and many rooms have panoramic harbor views. During the summer,
when the climate gets sticky, rooms range from $78 to $112 a night.
The legendary Peninsula Hotel, right next door, charges three times
as much for the same view.</TE>
<TE>   For food, it's easy to plunge into the city's many markets (the
most popular is probably the Night Market, on Temple Street west of
the Jordan metro station), where the short-order chefs at "cooked
food" stalls will prepare whatever you point to, and prices are $3 to
$6 per heaping portion. Unlike in American restaurants, meats are
always fresh; the chicken you eat was probably clucking around the
kitchen when you ordered it.</TE>
<TE>   The city is also chockablock with dai pai dong, or food stalls,
which are humble storefront eateries, many run by folks who don't
speak English but know how to whip up an inexpensive meal.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong's subway is another bargain. The MTR, www.mtrcorp.com,
goes everywhere you want for $1.40 or less. It is cool and quiet, and
wired throughout for cell phone reception.</TE>
<TE>   When it's time to leave town, you can even check your luggage at
two locations in the city and board a direct train to the airport for
about $10.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the markets, bargain shopping is not what it used to be.
Catering to wealthy financiers, Hong Kong is stocked with expensive
outlets like Burberry, Gucci and Fendi.</TE>
<TE>   Electronics are often priced at U.S. levels, and increasingly, you
must be careful what you buy, because manufacturers are creating
compatibility conflicts to force consumers to purchase items in their
home countries.</TE>
<TE>   At particular issue are DVDs, which were once harvested by the
dozens by bargain-hungry Americans but, like videotapes, are usually
coded to malfunction on your home player. VCDs, low-resolution movies
you play on your home computer, are an exception; you can buy the
latest releases, with Chinese subtitles, to play at home for $1.90 to
$6.50 at the discount stalls.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Delight Tours, (800) 221-7179,
www.pacificdelighttours.com, sells vacations including flights from
Los Angeles and six nights' lodging at a mid-level Kowloon hotel for
$890 during the summer. China Focus Travel, (415) 788-8660,
www.chinafocustravel.com, maximizes touring time by combining a stay
in Hong Kong with tours of five mainland cities; that 15-day tour,
including air from the West Coast, is $1,799 during most months.</TE>

<LD>Across the board, shipboard dress codes have relaxed considerably,
but this does not mean jeans and T-shirts. The fashion police are
still aboard many ships, and you may get stares or frowns if you turn
up for dinner wearing the wrong kind of casual.</LD>
<LD>   The new casual, also called "resort evening wear" or "country club
casual," usually consists of open-necked linen or silk shirts and
slacks for men and dressy pantsuits, caftans or silk and linen
separates for women.</LD>
<LD>   Don't confuse "informal" attire with "casual," as many first-time
cruisers do. On most cruise lines, informal means jacket and tie for
men and cocktail dresses or dressy pantsuits for women. On Crystal
Cruises, only a jacket and slacks are requested for men; ties are
optional.</LD>
<TE>   Generally, the longer the cruise, the more formal the wardrobe,
with 100-day around-the-world sailings requiring lots of dressy
evening outfits. (We knew a retired man who carried 20 tuxedos and
dinner jackets on a world cruise.) Even today on a transatlantic
crossing aboard Cunard's Queen Elizabeth 2, on every evening except
embarkation day, male passengers are required to wear a tuxedo or
dark suit.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the relaxation of dress codes, many large ships still
designate one or two formal nights a week. A tuxedo is not
obligatory; a dark suit, a white dinner jacket or even a dark blazer
and pants often will do. If you hate ties and refuse to wear one, you
can still pass muster with a silk turtleneck or a shirt with ascot on
most traditional ships.</TE>
<TE>   If you would like to dress up in a tuxedo but don't own one, some
cruise lines, including Carnival, Celebrity, Princess and Royal
Caribbean, rent them. Usually rentals are arranged in advance; ask
your travel agent or the cruise line when booking.</TE>
<TE>   Traveling light and practical packing are also important in these
days of increased security. During our 20-plus years of cruising, we
have developed simple rules for packing for cruises, any of which can
be broken occasionally but all of which work in the long run. For
three months on the road in Europe last year, we each carried only
one roll-aboard suitcase small enough to stow in the overhead and one
carry-on computer/camera bag, but had along everything we needed for
vessels from a QE2 crossing to riverboats and barges. Here are some
tips:</TE>
<TE>   * Don't take anything new. The temptation to splurge on a cruise
wardrobe is great, but remember that none of your fellow passengers
has seen your existing wardrobe. Also, you know how your outfits are
going to work and what accessories go with them.</TE>
<TE>   * Take half as many clothes as you think you need. Closet and
drawer space on ships is limited, and laundry and dry cleaning
service is available.</TE>
<TE>   * Consider the climate. Stick to cottons and linens in tropical
climates, such as the Caribbean, Mexico, South Pacific and Southeast
Asia, with a sweater or sweatshirt for breezy days on deck. For
transatlantic crossings, Alaska or northern Europe, take jackets,
rain gear, caps and scarves and one or more daytime outfits for those
unexpectedly warm, sunny days.</TE>
<TE>   * Dress modestly ashore. Shorts and halters or tank tops are fine
on deck, but shore excursions to tropical ports need more
conservative clothes, say Bermuda shorts and short-sleeved T-shirts.
Some temples and churches may require covered knees and shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   * Plan for purchases ashore. Because you may be tempted to buy
garments in ports of call, leave space in your suitcase. Limit gift
shopping to small, unbreakable, easily packed items such as scarves,
necklaces, place mats and small leather goods.</TE>
<TE>   * If the shoe fits, take it. Comfortable flat shoes for deck and
shore wear are essential items. Feet swell in tropical climates, and
some ports of call have cobblestones and potholes in their streets.
Save the fancy footwear for the captain's cocktail party.</TE>
<TE>   * Less is more. Pack travel sizes of toiletries, sample vials of
perfumes that department stores hand out, and small vials of shampoo
from hotel rooms.</TE>
<TE>   * Plan your wardrobe around the ship's personality. A list below
identifies cruise lines that expect a dress-up outfit at least one
night a week and those that allow resort-style garb or casual
clothing every night.</TE>
<TE>   Take a tuxedo or dark suit on Carnival, Celebrity, Costa, Crystal,
Cunard Line, First European, Holland America Line, Peter Deilmann,
Princess, Radisson Seven Seas (except in Alaska and Tahiti), Royal
Caribbean International, Royal Olympic, Seabourn and Silversea.</TE>
<TE>   A jacket and tie will suffice on Disney, Orient Lines, Radisson
Seven Seas ships in Alaska and World Explorer.</TE>
<TE>   Don't even pack a tie on Norwegian, Radisson Seven Seas in Tahiti,
SeaDream Yacht Club, Star Clippers, Windjammer Barefoot or Windstar.
The same goes for all expedition ships and for small American-flag
lines that cruise rivers, lakes and the coastal U.S., such as
American Canadian Caribbean Line, American Cruise Lines, American
Safari, American West, Clipper, Cruise West, Delta Queen Steamboat
Co. and RiverBarge Excursions.</TE>

<HD>Treasures of Spanish Colonial Art on Display in Santa Fe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the most wide-ranging collections of Spanish colonial art in
the U.S. will open to the public for the first time July 21 in a new
museum in Santa Fe, N.M. Most of the 3,000 pieces have never been
displayed, said Stuart A. Ashman, the museum's executive director.</LD>
<LD>   The Museum of Spanish Colonial Art is in a renovated 1930 building
designed by Pueblo Revival pioneer John Gaw Meem on a hilltop about
two miles southeast of downtown. The building, donated anonymously in
1998, houses artwork that Santa Fe's Spanish Colonial Arts Society
has been gathering since the 1920s.</LD>
<LD>   Only about 75 of the pieces have been displayed at the adjacent
Museum of International Folk Art; the rest have been in storage or
undergoing conservation, Ashman said.</LD>
<TE>   Highlights include a wooden colonial house built in Mexico in the
18th century; a room based on the 1815 estate inventory of Santa Fe
military man Capt. Manuel Delgado; and a 1780 image of San Rafael,
believed to be the earliest retablo (religious painting on wood) in
New Mexico. Artworks include paintings, jewelry, tools and furniture
from the Americas, Europe and Asia from the 18th century to modern
times. About 600 pieces are on permanent display.</TE>
<TE>   The museum will be open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Admission is $6
for adults, free for ages 16 and younger. A joint pass good for
admission to five Santa Fe museums, including this one, over four
days costs $15. (505) 982-2226, www.spanishcolonial.org.</TE>

<HD>Scenic Colorado Railroad on Track to Resume Trips</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DURANGO, Colo.--The Durango &amp; Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad planned
to resume its service to Silverton over the weekend after canceling
it June 20 because of fire danger. Cinders from the coal-fired
engines' stacks have been known to start fires.</LD>
<LD>   Owner Allen Harper said last week that his railroad expects
ridership to be 30% or more below normal for the rest of the season.
The train usually carries about 200,000 passengers a year. For
updates, call (888) 872-4607 or visit www.durangotrain.com.</LD>
<LD>   Saying that some Durango-area tourist businesses may not survive
because of the decline in tourist traffic as a result of wildfires,
Harper was lobbying Congress for disaster grants and low-interest
loans of up to $25 million for hotels, restaurants, rafting companies
and other operations. More than 70,000 acres have burned near Durango
in a fire that was nearly 90% contained as of the Travel section's
press time Tuesday.</LD>

facilities at hotels, restaurants and tourist attractions and also
ranks them on their accessibility. It includes information for
wheelchair users and visually and hearing-impaired travelers.</LD>
<LD>   Details it notes include heights of bed frames, sinks, desks and
coin slots for public phones; distance between bed and wall; and
whether Braille menus and TDD phone kits are available.</LD>
<LD>   So far the guides are offered for California, Hawaii, Las Vegas,
central Florida (including the Orlando area), New York and
Washington, D.C. They retail for $12.95 at bookstores and are also

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Delta Queen riverboat, the National Historic Landmark that has
plied the rivers of the South and Midwest for decades, begins its
first season under new owners on Aug. 26. Fares have been cut from
last year, a spokeswoman said.</LD>
<LD>   The boat is operated by Delta Queen Steamboat Co., whose former
parent company, American Classic Voyages, filed for Chapter 11
reorganization last fall.</LD>
<LD>   The steamboat company is now a subsidiary of Delaware North Cos.,
which bought the Delta Queen and two of its sister vessels, the
American Queen and Mississippi Queen, in a court-supervised auction
in May. (Acquisition of a fourth boat, the Columbia Queen, by
American West Steamboat Co. is pending. It is expected to go into
service next year on the Columbia and Snake rivers in the Pacific
Northwest.) The Mississippi Queen is sailing; the American Queen will
resume Jan. 18.</LD>
<TE>   Fares on the Delta Queen begin at $375 per person, double
occupancy, for a three-day cruise (including port fees), compared
with $495 last year. (800) 543-1949, www.deltaqueen.com.</TE>

<HD>2 Cruise Lines Cancel Port Calls on St. Croix</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two cruise lines have canceled calls on St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin
Islands, citing security and crime problems.</LD>
<LD>   Carnival Cruise Lines is substituting St. Martin for St. Croix on
semiweekly Eastern Caribbean sails of its Carnival Victory and
Carnival Triumph ships. The Victory made the switch in May; the
Triumph will make the switch when it resumes Eastern Caribbean
sailings Nov. 9. Spokeswoman Jennifer de la Cruz said Carnival crew
and passengers had been robbed several times in St. Croix in the last
few months.</LD>
<LD>   Last month Holland America, which had scheduled its new Zuiderdam
ship to make 36 calls on St. Croix in 2002 and 2003 during semiweekly
cruises beginning Dec. 14, decided to replace St. Croix with St.
Kitts and Nevis. It cited "security concerns."</LD>
<TE>   Both lines said St. Croix officials had met with them in
unsuccessful attempts to reverse their decisions.</TE>

<HD>Casting a Vote for Sierra City's Fishing</HD>
<DH>Gold Country town harbors exhilarating waters, quiet hikes
and a secret garden</DH>

<AU>CAROLYN MILLER</AU>

<DL>SIERRA CITY, Calif.</DL>
<LD>I stood in waterproof waders, hip-deep in the surging Yuba River,
wielding a fly rod. Swallowtail butterflies and dragonflies swept
over the water, and sunlight glinted off distant mountains, a dusting
of snow still evident in June. Everything was perfect. Except I still
hadn't caught a fish.</LD>
<LD>   No matter. It was hard to be upset about elusive trout when so
much natural beauty surrounded us. My husband, Terry, and I came to
this dot of a place in the Sierra last month to rendezvous with my
cousin John and his wife, Val, both big fans of this hamlet of 225
and our willing guides for the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Sierra City is about 130 miles northeast of Sacramento, past
Auburn and Grass Valley on California Highway 49. The route through
town isn't so much a highway as it is an old-fashioned main street,
lined with well-preserved buildings from the Gold Rush. The North
Yuba River runs through town, and the jagged pinnacles of the Sierra
Buttes, 8,600 feet high, rise on the horizon.</LD>
<TE>   The region is often called the Lakes Basin because dozens of
natural lakes lie within a 10-mile radius. My cousin, an avid fly
fisherman who lives in the Bay Area, was initially drawn here by the
wild river and its trout, while Val, a landscape designer, was hooked
by the wildflowers and hiking trails. It wasn't long before we were
hooked too.</TE>
<TE>   Our Friday-morning flight to Sacramento was about one hour and the
drive to Sierra City about three, though it would have been shorter
had we taken a faster, less scenic route. We stopped in Auburn for a
lunch of Greek salad and good quiche at a cute place called Awful
Annie's. An hour later, we paused in Nevada City for a stroll through
its Gold Rush-era downtown and a quick tasting at the Nevada City
Winery, where we picked up a bottle of its Sonata white blend.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the detours, we arrived in Sierra City and the High
Country Inn by cocktail hour. The inn sits at 5,400 feet near an old
stage stop and general store called Bassett's Station. We immediately
could see why John and Val had suggested the High Country Inn. With
only five guest rooms, the place is serene and quiet. The Yuba River
runs right through the property, which has its own trout pond and a
deck overlooking the Buttes. From our room, the Aspen, Terry and I
could hear the river rushing by and see a mama duck on the pond
tending to her babies.</TE>
<TE>   No sooner had we stepped onto the deck and uncorked the wine than
John and Val arrived--just in time to toast the weekend. We sketched
out options for the coming days: hike, fish, visit historic sights
such as the 1850s Kentucky Mine or the charming community of
Downieville, its ambience little changed since the Gold Rush.</TE>
<TE>   For dinner that night, the four of us chose a different bit of
history, the Old Sierra City Hotel in town. Built in 1880, the dining
room contains antique furniture and cabinetry from the hotel's
earliest days, but as at most restaurants in the region, the menu is
anything but fancy. The nightly special, which two of us ordered and
enjoyed, was meatloaf with mushroom gravy.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning began with more good food, a generous breakfast
at the inn. Guests awake to a tray of coffee and tea at their door,
followed by a spread in the dining room that includes hot dishes such
as French toast and quiche, as well as fresh fruit and home-baked
muffins and breads.</TE>
<TE>   Our day's activities then started--and ended--with fishing. John
revealed to me some of the mysteries of dry fly-fishing, in which a
nearly weightless, carefully crafted "fly" never dips below the
water's surface. (Terry watched with interest but, because of a bad
knee, was going to skip a trip into the river; Val opted to lounge
around the inn.)</TE>
<TE>   After I had grasped the rudiments of casting, I suited up. For the
first time in my life I donned waders, fishing vest, boots and
"gravel guards," gaiters that keep sand and rock out of boots.
Attached to my vest, safely tucked in a waterproof tube, was my
fishing license, purchased in L.A. (available at sporting goods
stores).</TE>
<TE>   I slid and skittered down a steep, stony riverbank and cautiously
followed John into the water. I was a little unnerved by the slippery
footing and the novelty of being almost waist-deep in a relatively
swift current.</TE>
<TE>   But toward the end of the day, after more practice and a move to a
different part of the river, I finally was learning to spot pools
where trout gathered, and my casts were becoming more accurate. I
even got a few bites, though I hadn't yet reeled one in. Being
half-immersed in the wild Yuba became exhilarating in a deeply
elemental way.</TE>
<TE>   These sessions in the river Saturday were broken up with an
excursion on land: a quick lunch of chili dogs and soup at Bassett's
Station cafe, followed by a short drive down the highway to Big
Springs Gardens.</TE>
<TE>   Our innkeeper, Bob Latta, had suggested a visit to the gardens, a
private estate rented out for group events and, more recently, a
place for Sunday brunch. Individuals can visit too--for free--as long
as they call ahead for permission.</TE>
<TE>   After a friendly greeting from owner Don Phillips, we wandered
paths that wind three miles through beautifully landscaped grounds,
partly modeled after Claude Monet's gardens at Giverny, France.
Indeed, the pond with waterlilies and the arched bridge did resemble
his famed paintings. But we came upon additional pleasures: fern
grottoes, gurgling creeks, beds of native California flowers and, as
a backdrop, the rugged Sierra.</TE>
<TE>   We left the cultivated blooms at Big Springs Gardens and soon were
among wildflowers along a trail to Frazier Falls. The easy hike, one
mile round trip, took us by a floral profusion ranging from delicate
pastels to intense jewel tones. Val shared the plant names, charmers
like "mountain pretty face" and bizarre ones like "beard tongue," a
type of penstemon.</TE>
<TE>   We capped the day with a drive to Sardine Lake, a few miles from
Sierra City, where we found a little hideaway called Poor George's
Playpen, part of Sardine Lake Resort. A cabin-like bar built over the
lake, the Playpen seemed to float on the water. Gin-and-tonics in
hand, we soaked in views of Sardine Lake and the Buttes.</TE>
<TE>   The resort's restaurant looked inviting, but we moved on for
dinner at the rustic, usually reliable Packer Lake Lodge about five
minutes away. The ribs and Cornish hen were all right, but no one was
inclined to rave. Perhaps we just caught the place on an off night.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday morning was my last date with the trout. Fully suited up,
John and I hiked down to a stretch of river not far from the inn. The
weather was perfect. We tried one promising pool after another, but
no strikes.</TE>
<TE>   My cousin suspected that the trout might be interested in
something other than the flies we offered. Taking a cue from a bug he
uncovered beneath a river rock, he selected a replica of a stonefly
nymph from his tackle box and tied it on my line. In the early nymph
stage of life, I learned, such aquatic flies live underwater. So John
said I had to cast my nymph beneath the surface and convince trout it
was a living morsel of food.</TE>
<TE>   My first attempts at nymph fishing were awkward. After I snagged
my line on underwater rocks a couple of times, John looked at his
watch. With hope fading with the hour, I tried again and hooked only
stone. Or was it?</TE>
<TE>   Amazingly enough, at the other end of the line was a gleaming,
wiggling rainbow trout. With John's assistance, I pulled it out of
the water. Though it would never set any size record, the fish was
beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   I hardly had a chance to admire my catch. John believes in
releasing fish, so he took this one off the hook and placed it back
into the water. Off went my little trout to enjoy the Yuba River
another day.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the inn, Terry and Val didn't have to ask how the fishing
had gone. They could tell by my grin. Lunch in a town called Graeagle
and a final hike around Madora Lake still lay ahead, but both were
merely bonuses. The pleasure of this place had already provided the
respite I was looking for.</TE>

<LD>Dining away gets a boost from these items, which may be available in
area stores. The prices listed here do not include shipping.</LD>
<LD>   What a gas: A gas grill gives an outdoor chef maximum cooking
control, and now you can take one with you when you leave home.</LD>
<LD>   The Grill to Go can be used as a tabletop grill or a free-standing
one when its folding legs are extended. The burner system is
stainless steel, and the 310-square-inch grate/griddle cooking
surface is Teflon.</LD>
<TE>   A removable grease tray empties easily. The adjustable cooking
surface has level and heat indicators, and there's a built-in igniter
for use with a 1- or 20-pound propane tank (not included).</TE>
<TE>   The grill has extending side tables with built-in utensil hooks,
and it comes with tongs, spatula and cleaning comb.</TE>
<TE>   Fully extended, the Grill to Go is 35 inches high by 46 inches
wide by 17 inches deep. It breaks down to 28 inches wide by 13 inches
high by 15 inches deep, weighs 40 pounds and fits in most car trunks.</TE>
<TE>   Grill to Go (10451) is $149.95 from AJ Prindle; (866) 774-8278,
www.ajprindle.com.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Anti-bug beam: This lightweight, battery-operated barbecue light
not only illuminates what's cooking but also repels flying insects.
Bug Off, the Mosquito-Repelling BBQ Light, clips onto the side table
of the grill, shedding a steady beam when the adjustable arm is
extended. (Remove the spring clip and the light sits on any flat
surface.) The bug repellent makes a buzzing sound that simulates the
sound of a dragonfly, a bug predator.</TE>
<TE>   A three-position switch provides a choice of audible or ultrasonic
bug-scaring waves. It sounds strange, but it worked at a cookout I
held. The unit is powered by four D batteries.</TE>
<TE>   Bug Off, the Mosquito-Repelling BBQ Light (10602), is $30 at
housewares stores; (800) 431-2486, www.zelco.com.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cool chair: Cool your heels and food at the same time with Good
Hope Bags' lightweight folding chair, which has a spacious insulated
zippered cooler bag on the underside of the seat. A mesh pocket on
the outside of the cooler holds sunglasses, lotion and other small
items.</TE>
<TE>   Available in two sizes (the small one is more comfortable for a
child), the chair is constructed of aluminum tubing with a nylon seat
and backrest. Collapsed, the small chair measures 18 by 13 inches and
weighs 4 pounds; the large chair folds to 22 by 16 inches and weighs
6 pounds. Both fold to about 2 inches thick.</TE>
<TE>   Small Folding Chair With Cooler (7367) is $23.99; large (7369),
$29.99; from 1-800-Luggage; (800) 584-4243, www.1800luggage.com.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One for the road: Don't let an absence of electricity keep you
from your margaritas. Take the party anywhere with this cordless
rechargeable blender from Power-to-Go.</TE>
<TE>   The 44-ounce-capacity heavy-duty plastic blender runs on a
removable sealed lead acid 6-volt battery pack. The battery charger
(included) comes with a 110-volt AC adapter for a standard wall
socket and a 12-volt DC adapter that plugs into a car cigarette
lighter, so you can recharge the battery at home or on the go. Never
mind the fancy blender settings: Depress the button for on, release
for off. Fully charged, the motor runs about 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Cordless Blender (PRB818) is $59.99 from A Trendy Home; (877)
667-4663, www.atrendyhome.com.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On a roll: Travelers Club's Rolling Picnic Carriers are roomy
thermal coolers on wheels that come with a complete picnic set for
two to four people, depending on the style.</TE>
<TE>   The set, which comes in its own zippered compartment attached to
the cooler, contains heavy-duty plastic plates, stemware, utensils,
salt and pepper shakers, a serrated knife, a corkscrew/bottle opener,
a cutting board and checkered napkins, all held in place with elastic
straps.</TE>
<TE>   Some models of the picnic set zip off from the main cooler; others
are permanently sewn on. I like the detachable kind because it can be
carried separately or left behind when not needed. The coolers have
external pockets for accessories as well as handles for hoisting.
Some models have internal dividers for separating hot and cold foods.</TE>
<TE>   Rolling Coolers with picnic sets are $89.99 to $109.99, including
shipping, from Bags &amp; Beyond; (310) 941-3727 (Los Angeles),
www.bagsandbeyond.com.</TE>

<HD>Shuttle Buses Promote the Sound of Silence in Zion National
Park</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The classic hike from the floor of Utah's Zion Canyon to the rimrock
Observation Point still offers everything it always has: a sampling
of slick-rock country, passage through a narrow canyon and stunning
views. But now hikers will find more.</LD>
<LD>   More quietude.</LD>
<LD>   Count me as an enthusiastic supporter of Zion National Park's
shuttle system, started in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   During the peak season of March to October, visitors must ride
buses into the heart of Zion Canyon, leaving their cars behind.</TE>
<TE>   Eliminating most private vehicles has improved visits to the park
immeasurably. No parking hassles. No jumping in and out of a car to
reach a viewpoint or trail head. And no noise.</TE>
<TE>   OK, you occasionally hear a bus. But gone are the other engines
echoing up the canyon walls to vista points such as Angels Landing.</TE>
<TE>   "The trail to Observation Point has long been my favorite hike in
the park," said Marcel Rodriguez, 79, a park interpreter at the
visitor center. "Now, without the traffic down below, it's even
better."</TE>
<TE>   Though temperatures rise well above 100, summer is still a popular
time for this week's featured route, the challenging trek to
Observation Point.</TE>
<TE>   As Rodriguez said, "It packs a lot of Zion into four miles of
trail." I couldn't agree more. Just remember to take lots of water
and sunscreen and to start early in the morning, so you can avoid the
midafternoon heat.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the trail head: The shuttle system has two
components. Springdale Loop buses take visitors from five locations
in the nearby town of Springdale to the Zion visitor center at the
park's south entrance. From there, the Zion Canyon Loop shuttle
continues to eight stops inside the park, including the Zion Museum
and various viewpoints.</TE>
<TE>   Pickups are every six to 30 minutes depending on the shuttle and
the time of day. Operating hours vary by shuttle; for details call
(435) 772-0312 or go to www.nps.gov/zion/ShuttleSystem.htm for a
sample (though not necessarily current) schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Another option is to skip the Springdale shuttle altogether. Drive
to the Zion visitor center, park, then hop aboard the Zion Canyon
Loop shuttle.</TE>
<TE>   The hike starts at the Weeping Rock stop.</TE>
<TE>   The hike: Partly paved Observation Point Trail switchbacks up rock
walls, offering better views with each gain in elevation. Look down
and see the alcove that harbors Weeping Rock.</TE>
<TE>   After climbing half a mile, you will spot a signed half-mile spur
trail that leads to Hidden Canyon. If you want to try this optional
side trip, grasp the chain handrails along the narrow ledge.</TE>
<TE>   With a 1,000-foot drop-off, it's a cliffhanger. The route
continues up a trailless wash between towering walls of sandstone at
the bottom of Hidden Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the main trail, hike half a mile farther to the mouth of
Echo Canyon, a narrow chasm with awesome walls of fluted stone spiked
with pines. Switchbacks rise to a junction with East Rim Trail at the
two-mile mark.</TE>
<TE>   Continue toward Observation Point. The trail is wide, but you'll
encounter more 1,000-foot drop-offs in places. The path traverses
white cliffs, then reaches a plateau dotted with pinyon pine and
juniper. At the 3 1/2-mile mark, you'll pass a junction with East
Mesa Trail; stick to Observation Point Trail as it turns south.</TE>
<TE>   A fairly level hike on a sandy path leads to the edge of the
plateau and Observation Point. Use a park map to identify the great
stone cathedrals and ramparts around you.</TE>

<HD>Don't Get Stuck With European Sticker Shock</HD>
<DH>The winter's drastic discounts are history, but all is not
lost for Americans seeking a deal on the Continent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It feels like the old days in Europe for penny-pinching American
visitors this summer, and that can be a shock.</LD>
<LD>   After an uncertain start, the Continent's peak travel season has
settled into a pattern of $1,000-plus round-trip air fares from the
West Coast and a sinking dollar. Gone are the under-$600 London round
trips of winter and spring and the cheap euro, the universal currency
adopted last winter in 12 Western European countries.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately you can still plan an affordable Continental idyll by
using tours, packages and perhaps a change in dates. Fall and winter
in Europe can be lovely--and cheaper.</LD>
<TE>   First, some perspective.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, getting to Europe doesn't cost much more than it
did last summer. It just seems expensive compared with this year's
off-season winter fares, which were driven into a tailspin by
discounts that followed the huge drop in transatlantic travel after
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Round-trip summer fares between LAX and London are up about 3%
from last year, said Bob Harrell of Harrell Associates, a New
York-based firm that tracks air fares through the database that
supplies computerized reservation systems used by travel agents. The
lowest advance-purchase fare for nonstops on that route was recently
about $984, compared with last summer's $956, he found. (Note: Fares
change constantly, and those fares, found about 10 days ago, may no
longer be available by the time you read this.)</TE>
<TE>   Getting to Paris is a different story. Fewer nonstops are offered
from LAX than last year; Air France alone reduced its transatlantic
flights by 14%, the European Travel Commission says. So it can be
tough to get a cheap seat. Round-trip fares for LAX-Paris nonstops
are up nearly 20% from last summer, said Harrell, who recently found
the lowest advance-purchase fare to be $1,176 versus $988 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   What has happened is that fewer Americans are flying to Europe,
but there are also fewer seats because airlines cut back flights to
match supply with the anticipated drop in demand. The result: higher
fares, depending on the route.</TE>
<TE>   And the dollar is buying about 9% less in Europe than it did at
the start of the year. Late last month it reached virtual parity with
the euro, with an exchange rate of 1.01 dollars to the euro. It has
also lost nearly 5% against the British pound this year. (Britain
does not use the euro.)</TE>
<TE>   Here are some strategies to lower the cost of a European trip:</TE>
<TE>   * Take a tour: Big tour operators often get discounts from hotels
and airlines in return for the high volume of business they give
them, and they pass the savings on to customers. Sometimes you can
buy a whole vacation for only a few hundred dollars more than the air
fare would cost if you booked it on your own. A good travel agent
should offer a range of tours.</TE>
<TE>   With U.S. tour business to Europe down an average of 15% to 25%,
depending on the company and destination, there are more peak-season
values than usual. Some examples:</TE>
<TE>   Through Aug. 29, New York-based Trafalgar Tours is offering an
eight-day "Taste of Britain" fully escorted trip, with overnights in
London, York and Edinburgh, Scotland, starting at $1,540 per person,
double occupancy, including air fare from LAX. (800) 648-1638,
www.trafalgar.com.</TE>
<TE>   Insight Vacations' nine-day summer "Taste of Tuscany" tour starts
at $1,980 per person, double occupancy, if you book by July 30 and
fly American Airlines from LAX. The escorted trip includes stops in
Rome, Florence and Siena. (888) 562-0111,
www.inusa.insightvacations.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Get a package deal: Not the group type? By booking a package,
independent travelers can get many of the price breaks that tour
operators get. Packages often combine air, hotel and sometimes a
rental car or other extras for a less expensive total. You choose the
time and travel companions (if any) and arrange your own activities
and meals. Many packages use lesser-known or charter airlines. Some
examples:</TE>
<TE>   The six-day "Celebrate Paris" package from Adventure Vacations in
La Jolla, available through August, starts at $869 per person,
double, including round-trip air from LAX on the French airline
Corsair, five nights' lodging in central Paris, daily breakfast and
store discount cards. (800) 600-5587.</TE>
<TE>   New York-based Petrabax Vacations has a weeklong summer package to
Spain, including round-trip air from LAX and six nights' lodging in
Madrid, starting at $1,162 per person, double. The package is good
for departures through the end of August. (800) 634-1188,
www.petrabaxusa.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Travel off-season: Europe draws fewer tourists in spring and
fall than in summer, and far fewer in winter. To fill rooms and
airline seats in lean periods, hotels and airlines may cut prices.
The lowest air fares traditionally start Nov. 1 and continue through
winter, except for the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   This year seems to be following tradition. The LAX-to-London
nonstop round trip that costs $984 this summer costs as little as
$556 when bought for the off-season, Harrell found--about the same as
last winter. LAX-Paris fares were showing a similar drop--more than
40%. (Fare sales and shifts in demand can change these numbers
between now and winter.)</TE>
<TE>   Nearly any European tour or package is cheaper in winter than in
summer, and many prices drop a bit in fall and spring too. Some
examples:</TE>
<TE>   Trafalgar's 10-day "Paris &amp; Provence" package, including
round-trip air from LAX, lodging, some meals, high-speed train fare
from Paris to Lyon and a cruise, starts at $1,975 through Aug. 30.
The package is $1,445 from Nov. 1 to Feb. 28. (Contact information
above.)</TE>
<TE>   Insight Vacations' 10-day "Amazing Spain &amp; Portugal" escorted
tour, including round-trip air from LAX, begins at $1,134 for travel
in November, December and parts of January. If booked by Sept. 30,
the price drops to $1,084--a little more than $100 per day. (Contact
information above.)</TE>
<TE>   Adventure Vacations' $869 summer "Celebrate Paris" package,
mentioned above, loses a day, going to five days, for September
departures and drops to $579. From Oct. 1 to Dec. 15, the five-day
package, renamed the "Christmas Shopping Tour to Paris," starts at
$529. (Contact information above.)</TE>
<TE>   Be flexible: Taking a connecting flight rather than a nonstop can
save you money because people are willing to pay more for the
convenience of a nonstop, notes Neil S. Martin, spokesman for the
European Travel Commission. He also suggests that you book well in
advance, use public transit and trains for short-hop intra-European
travel and eat what the locals eat to save money.</TE>

<HD>Stepping Into a Sacred and Political Place</HD>
<DH>Ancient Kumbum monastery has rich intrigue behind its
rebuilt walls</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE MEYER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>HUANGZHONG, China</DL>
<LD>The white, laser-printed piece of paper said little yet announced so
much. As Kumbum monastery rose to activity at sunrise, I wandered its
cobblestone paths watching a silent parade of crimson robes and
shaved heads enter its temples. Soon the monks' collective, guttural
chants echoed in Tibetan through the complex, drawing me to their
source.</LD>
<LD>   At the entrance to the Great Hall of Meditation, a note affixed to
an ancient wood archway shone in the day's first light. Its four
Chinese characters said, "Tourists, please come in."</LD>
<LD>   Many do, to the delight of China's tourism officials. Kumbum is
one of Tibetan Buddhism's holiest sites. The monastery, called
Ta'ersi in Chinese, is a favorite attraction for China's burgeoning
domestic tourism industry.</LD>
<TE>   Tucked into a mountainous cleft in central Qinghai Province, the
monastery's region has spawned two Buddhist luminaries: the current
Dalai Lama and, five centuries ago, the founder of his Gelugpa, or
Yellow Hat, sect, Tsongkhapa.</TE>
<TE>   The original temple was built in 1560 on the site of Tsongkhapa's
birthplace, beside a tree that, according to legend, sprouted from
drops of blood that fell from his umbilical cord, with each of its
thousand leaves bearing the face of the Buddha.</TE>
<TE>   Kumbum today is hemmed in by more than lush, rolling hills. It
also straddles a sensitive divide between two cultures, two histories
and the contradicting aims of piety and profit. On the pilgrim
circuit, Kumbum ranks behind only the monasteries of Jokhang, Drepung
and Sera in Lhasa. I had seen those three on a previous trip to Tibet
(as a tourist, not a penitent) and was curious to compare the
Buddhist pilgrim culture within Tibet to that just outside its
current border, especially since the redrawing of China's map after
1950. This part of Qinghai was historically a part of Tibet's Amdo
Province.</TE>
<TE>   I had come here last summer for a break from Xining, a railhead 15
miles to the northeast and the capital of Qinghai. Having just
finished grad school at Berkeley, I was on a six-week overland trek
across the width of China from the Afghan border all the way to
Shanghai.</TE>
<TE>   Xining was an intoxicating mixture of Han, Hui (Muslim), Salar and
Tibetan traders, perched at 6,700 feet on the Tibetan plateau in
northwest China and rimmed by dusty, treeless cliffs. A boomtown
infamous for reform camps that use prisoners to manufacture goods,
Xining was also the staging point for construction of the train line
to Tibet, and it bustled with a frontier air.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese in search of work pushed their bedrolls past performers
holding monkeys on chains, touts searching for travelers bound for
Lhasa by 60-hour bus ride, and pilgrims to one of China's largest
mosques--and to Kumbum.</TE>
<TE>   At the bus stop for Kumbum, packed vehicles departed every 10
minutes for the monastery, bearing shutterbugs and seekers. The
20-minute ride along a new highway breezed us past fields glowing
yellow with rapeseed in bloom. We passed a billboard whose peeling
paint showed a rakish couple with a little girl and the caption,
"Only having one child is good." Farther up the road, Chairman Mao,
Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin waved over a mixture of China's 56
ethnicities in headdresses. The three leaders had been united by
computerized photo manipulation, and their images had a faint glow
about them. This scene bore the words, "Hold high the banner of great
national unity. Defend the motherland's integrity. Combat against
splitting the nation."</TE>
<TE>   It was still early morning when the bus dropped us at Kumbum's
entrance, an imposing stone gate crowned with three tiled towers
whose eaves curled skyward. They overlooked Huang- zhong's large
market square, staffed by Han and Hui merchants selling rosaries,
jewelry and swords. Their chants of "looky, looky" were drowned out
by the calls of tour group leaders and coordinated shouts that roared
from the new military base adjacent to Kumbum's eastern wall.</TE>
<TE>   I stopped for a bowl of noodles and wandered about the stalls. One
sold cloth shoes large enough to cover my enormous Western-size feet.
Shopping beside me was a young monk wearing old loafers two sizes too
large. Buddhism teaches that life can be a sea of suffering, and I
could think of no better illustration of it than making a long
pilgrimage in ill-fitting shoes.</TE>
<TE>   I told the saleswoman to put a new pair for him on my tab. To my
surprise, the vendors also openly pitched pendants and photographs of
the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, who until recently was second in
spiritual command to the Dalai Lama. The images captured them as
young men--laughing on a couch next to an uneasy Mao Tse-tung during
a meeting in Beijing--and as elders, sitting in the lotus position in
an imagined scene in front of the Potala Palace in Lhasa. Even before
I had set foot inside Kumbum, I was face to face with its current
controversy, involving living Buddhas and the Chinese government.</TE>
<TE>   After Tashilhunpo monastery in Shigatse, Tibet, Kumbum is the
second seat of the Panchen Lama, the monk charged with protecting
Tibet and tutoring the Dalai Lama. When the 10th Panchen Lama,
pictured on the souvenirs for sale at Kumbum, died in 1989, two
searches began for his reincarnation. One was headed by the exiled
Dalai Lama, the other by the Chinese Communist Party.</TE>
<TE>   The Dalai Lama recognized a 9-year-old boy from near Kumbum, the
government another candidate. The Dalai Lama's choice hasn't been
seen in public since his selection, and human rights groups call him
the world's youngest political prisoner, a charge Beijing denies,
saying he attends school in a "secure" location. The impasse became
so tense that the government's plans to install the 11th Panchen Lama
in Shigatse were scrapped because of opposition within Tibet.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Beijing planned on moving him to Kumbum, a decision that
rankled monks here and led to the government's shutting down a school
at the monastery and detaining and expelling students.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese Panchen Lama is now ensconced in the capital, rumored
to be living in an opulent villa that once belonged to Chen Xitong,
the former Beijing mayor now jailed on corruption charges. The
crackdown also resulted in the unexpected defection of Kumbum's
abbot, Agya Rinpoche, to California in 1998. Had the abbot overseen
the installation of the government's Panchen Lama, he would have
legitimized its choice, undermining the Dalai Lama.</TE>
<TE>   These events were, of course, absent from the history printed in
Chinese and English (but not Tibetan) on the back of Kumbum's
entrance ticket. And, judging by their happy poses, they were also
absent from the minds of the tourists who crowded one another for
photographs beside the young Han female guides dressed as Tibetans.</TE>
<TE>   The monastery had recently undergone a $3-million renovation. I
wondered whether the money was reparation for the 21 years that
Kumbum spent converted into an agricultural commune or whether it was
an investment that entrance fees were expected to recoup. The
guidebooks I carried failed to provide the complex's background.</TE>
<TE>   Surfing at a Xining Internet cafe filled it in, though more often
my Internet search turned up breathless accounts like: "It's in a
wonderfully desolate area with relatively few tourists compared to
sites farther east. You can really get a taste for monastic life and
even make friends with the monks!"</TE>
<TE>   No travel story noted Kumbum's political intrigue, the fact that
it was largely leveled by an earthquake in 1990, or the massive
rebuilding by the Chinese government. These were left to the few news
accounts. I was struck by the division of coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Standing at the row of eight white stupas honoring martyred lamas
that marked its entrance, I sensed that Kumbum is a mere shadow of
what it once was. Visiting the temple was like taking two trips in
one--an experience of what it is and an imagination of what it was.</TE>
<TE>   In the daytime, when they are filled with visitors, China's
Buddhist centers look and feel thriving. Restorations are taking
place across the country, and daily I read of the commitment to the
Chinese constitution's guarantee of freedom of religion. In July the
government even brought a legion of American reporters to Kumbum to
showcase the gains.</TE>
<TE>   But it isn't until nighttime, when the crowds depart, that the
monasteries reveal their sad emptiness. Kumbum was built to
accommodate 6,000 monks. Now it had only 500.</TE>
<TE>   I maneuvered around the crowds and their calls of "Hello,
foreigner," pausing to remind one grating man that Siddhartha, who
founded Buddhism in India, was a foreigner too.</TE>
<TE>   I asked one of the young Han guides where I could leave my
luggage. She pointed across the street to the new luxury Tsongkha
Hotel, where a room was a comparatively exorbitant $55.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't afford that," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "But you're a foreigner," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Then a karmic moment: The newly shod monk passed by and waved me
close to him, pointing to a small, hand-painted sign that hung over a
narrow doorway: "Pilgrim's Guest House." I entered and was greeted by
a wizened old man who handed me a thermos of hot water and a padlock
with a key.</TE>
<TE>   "Take any room upstairs," he said, smiling. "You're the only
guest."</TE>
<TE>   "How much is it?"</TE>
<TE>   "Fifteen yuan [about $2] a night, and you can pay me when you
leave." He refused to take my passport, usually a requirement when
checking into a Chinese hotel.</TE>
<TE>   What the guest house lacked in amenities--there were none--it made
up for in character. It had existed on this spot since Kumbum was
founded. At the turn of the 20th century, Canadian missionary doctor
Susie Rijnhart stayed here, an experience recounted in her book,
"With the Tibetans in Tent and Temple." Not long after, French
explorer Alexandra David-Neel was a guest for three years.</TE>
<TE>   I crept up the narrow, rickety wood staircase and chose a room
with a dirty window and two iron-frame beds stacked with army
blankets and lighted by a single exposed bulb. The shared bathroom
was on the rooftop, and no water ran from the tap. I decided to stay
the night.</TE>
<TE>   Dusk came on slowly, and the last of the tour buses had departed.
I wound my way through the monastery's 30 halls, which housed ancient
tapestries, frescoed bodhisattvas, golden Buddhas and rows of prayer
wheels. Pilgrims smeared butter on statues, then stuck seeds and
money to them. In the Butter Sculpture Hall they bowed to elaborately
painted carvings that depicted scenes from Siddhartha's life and
Tibetan folk tales. Kumbum was theirs now and theirs alone.</TE>
<TE>   My favorite thing about seeing temples in China is their color--a
rainbow of blue, ochre, white, yellow and red that is even more
luminous against the drab modern buildings outside the gates. Nowhere
is this better seen than at Kumbum, where the ongoing restoration
spruces up wood buildings that hold traditional schools of medicine,
institutes devoted to the study of the sutras and Tantra, and, in
dwindling numbers, monks. One invited me into his room, him to
practice English and me to practice Chinese.</TE>
<TE>   He brewed black tea and offered me a bowl of tsampa--barley eaten
by rolling it into a ball with salty yak butter. As we talked I
noticed a TV, a DVD player, a stereo, a box of tapes and movies, and
a bookshelf of English conversation books and photos of the Dalai
Lama. I asked the monk what was the biggest issue facing Kumbum. "All
the tourists," he answered quickly. It is difficult to contemplate
emptiness when the space around you is filled with people. The monk
followed my gaze to a stack of Jackie Chan films atop the TV.</TE>
<TE>   "Those can't help either," I teased.</TE>
<TE>   Before arriving here, I had read that it could be politically
dangerous for monks to have guests in their quarters. On this night,
the monk said, he would face no trouble for having me over. Was he
naive? Was he fearless? Was he a cop?</TE>
<TE>   Were the dangers overstated?</TE>
<TE>   I felt the same uncertainty as when traveling in Tibet--the
situation could, and often did, change daily. The Dalai Lama urges
people to travel to Tibet and to experience Tibetan culture. So does
the Chinese government. One profits spiritually, the other
economically. But at what cost? I asked myself throughout the night
at the guest house, wondering whether I should be there. The fleas
feasting on my ankles certainly were glad I had come.</TE>
<TE>   I emptied my backpack and bundled up in all my clothing to ward
off the chill, then climbed to the guest house roof. The Milky Way,
called the Silver River in Chinese, throbbed low and bright in the
darkness in a way that high-altitude countryside reveals. Low horns
reverberated through the valley, blown by a pair of monks from a
rooftop.</TE>
<TE>   Dawn's gentle, golden light woke me a few hours later. I opened my
eyes to a world transformed. Magpies and roosters mixed their songs
with the incense smoke wafting through the damp air. Monks wrapped in
their red wool robes shuffled silently into the Great Hall of
Meditation.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, bells rang softly, and a steady drum thumped while a
pilgrim stretched out on the ground below me. I hadn't seen her at
the hostel, and the monastery walls were locked. When and from where
she had arrived I didn't know.</TE>
<TE>   She flattened her body, then pressed her forehead to the cold
stones, accumulating karmic merit with every motion. Her prayers
echoed through Kumbum. The buzz of an approaching tour bus rolled
through the valley. The pilgrim took one step forward and began her
routine all over again.</TE>

<TE>   Guidebook: The Call of Kumbum</TE>
<TE>   Getting there: Kumbum (Ta'ersi) is in Lushaer village, Huangzhong
County, 15 miles southwest of Xining. From LAX, fly Japan Air Lines,
All Nippon or United to Tokyo, then United or Northwest to Beijing
and Air China to Xining. Restricted round-trip fares begin at $1,223.
If you're already in Beijing, you can take an Air China flight to
Xining; the restricted round-trip fare is $370.</TE>
<TE>   Minibuses depart dawn to dusk from Ximen (West Gate) bus station
in central Xining. A ticket for the 20-minute ride is about 50 cents.
Returning, buy your ticket at the new bus depot adjacent to Kumbum,
or hop into one of the taxis that bundle four passengers together (60
cents each) for a more comfortable and quicker trip back to Xining.
At Kumbum, the $3.60 entrance fee gets you an oversized ticket with
10 punch holes. A monk is supposed to subtract a hole for each temple
you enter. It rarely happens.</TE>
<TE>   Most tourists see Kumbum as a day trip from Xining. Staying
overnight is recommended because after the crowds depart--from 5 p.m.
until 8 a.m.--the temples are most enjoyable and authentic.</TE>
<TE>   Telephones: To call the numbers below from the U.S., dial 011 (the
international dialing code), 86 (the country code for China), 971
(the area code for Xining) and the local number.</TE>
<TE>   Where to stay: The new Qinghai Tsongkha Hotel, 57 Ying Bin Road,
614-4888,
www.orientaltravel.com/hotel/city/res_Silk_Road_Tsongkha_Hote_lXining
.htm, faces the monastery and borders the market square. Its 32 rooms
are modern and clean. You'll pay $42-$56 a night.</TE>
<TE>   The only other option is the Pilgrim's Hostel, where spartan
double rooms cost less than $2. The rooms have no bathroom, no
running water, a single exposed lightbulb, thin walls and lumpy steel
beds, but--honest--they make up for the lack of amenities with
character.</TE>
<TE>   If staying in Xining, the Minzu (Minority) Hotel (822-5951) on
Dongguan Dajie has a variety of comfortable rooms. A double room is
$12.</TE>

<LD>I enjoyed the article by Karl Zimmermann about the Pacific Princess
("Bye-Bye, Love Boat," June 30). As a young Englishman in the early
'80s, I was one of the ship's photographers on board its sister,
Island Princess. I got used to being called "Ace," after the TV
character.</LD>
<LD>   While working aboard another ship, Holland America's original
Statendam, I photographed an attractive young lady standing by the
ship's rail as we left New York. On arrival in Bermuda, I asked her
if I could show her the island.</LD>
<LD>   That same young lady and I recently celebrated our 21st wedding
anniversary.</LD>
<TE>   So you see, there is real romance on cruise ships. It will be sad
to see the Pacific Princess retired. .</TE>

<TE>   We probably have cruised more than 30 times aboard the Island
Princess and Pacific Princess. We remember the narrow beds where you
had to be a contortionist to engage in sex. The stall shower in the
bathroom was so small that it became a joke for the [on-board]
comedians: "I finally found out how to take a shower. You just apply
the soap to the walls and then rub up against them."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, we always enjoyed the cruises and recall this adage:
"If you cruise on a 2,000-passenger ship and you attend the captain's
party, you may remember the meatballs if they gave you heartburn. If
you cruise on a ship with fewer than 1,000 passengers, you remember
some friends you made during the cruise."</TE>

<LD>After reading "Second-Class Travelers" (Letters, July 7), I felt
compelled to offer an opinion of second-class travel in Europe.</LD>
<LD>   A friend and I used Eurail for the entire month of September 2000
and were thankful that we went first class.</LD>
<LD>   Many times we boarded a second-class car and had to maneuver
through several cars to get to an uncrowded first-class car, where
the seats were very comfortable. Second class was always crowded, and
I expect it will be much the same during the summer. I would advise
any traveler to bite the bullet and exchange a second-class pass for
first class. It's worth not having the hassle.</LD>

<LD>The Losing of America continues to creep across our nation, as noted
in "Historic Buildings Get New Life as Hotels in Capital" (News, Tips
&amp; Bargains, June 30). How can one of our capital's "most historic
landmarks, the 1842 General Post Office Building," be renamed the
Monaco after being remodeled as a high-end hotel?</LD>
<LD>   Does that truly reflect the image and respect we owe our country?</LD>
<LD>   I know that I would never go to Washington and stay in that hotel
since the name does not reflect its historic significance.</LD>

<HD>The Path to Family Bliss at the Beach</HD>
<DH>Maybe it's the soothing surf or the old pond on Martha's

<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL FELDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST TISBURY, Mass.</DL>
<LD>Planning a reunion for a family whose coat of arms could bear the
motto "Born to Bicker" is not a simple task.</LD>
<LD>   So when the Boston-bred Feldman clan agreed--for our matriarch's
75th birthday last summer--to head en masse to Martha's Vineyard,
questions arose on just what kind of accommodations to book.</LD>
<LD>   My mom posed the first question to my brother Steve, the lawyer:</LD>
<TE>   "Should we rent one big house for all of us?"</TE>
<TE>   The cross-examination was swift:</TE>
<TE>   "Why would we want to do that?"</TE>
<TE>   Mom: "Oh, you know I'm turning 75, and I don't know if we'll ever
be able to vacation all together again."</TE>
<TE>   Steve: "Well, I can tell you this. If we rent one big house, I can
guarantee you we won't vacation together again."</TE>
<TE>   We considered separate hotel rooms but thought that too sterile
for a reunion. Besides, without a kitchen, how would my mother engage
in three of her life's passions--preparing food, freezing it and
defrosting it for her grandchildren?</TE>
<TE>   After factoring in the inflated summer vacation rental rates, we
finally compromised on renting side-by-side houses, which we found on
one of several Martha's Vineyard Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   The contemporary one-story houses, which are down a dirt road in
West Tisbury, weren't much to look at from the outside. But they were
comfortable inside, particularly the larger of the two, a
four-bedroom with a screened-in porch, a spacious living room and,
most important, a convenient full kitchen, which rented for $2,500 a
week in late June.</TE>
<TE>   The houses were next to a large but unswimmable pond, ideal for
kayaking, at the center of the island.</TE>
<TE>   The downside of such an arrangement, we feared, would be our
distance from the beach. But as it turned out, the stay in West
Tisbury was a swimmer's dream.</TE>
<TE>   Because we were lodged about 15 minutes in almost any direction
from the coast, we had good reason to sample beaches throughout the
easy-to-traverse island.</TE>
<TE>   Exploring more than half a dozen of them in seven days, we
discovered that Martha's Vineyard may be compact, but it offers
beaches to meet almost anyone's cravings: sandy-bottomed or rocky;
cold water or warm; child-friendly or roiling.</TE>
<TE>   We also discovered that with enough space and enough activities,
we could all get along just swimmingly.</TE>
<TE>   On ferry day, our landing party consisted of my family of four;
Steve's equal-sized brood; another brother, Marc; and my mother and
stepfather. Later in the week an aunt and uncle joined us.</TE>
<TE>   The 85-mile drive to Cape Cod from Boston, where all but my
immediate family live, took less than two hours on a misty late June
morning, far less time than on midsummer getaway days.</TE>
<TE>   We gladly paid $208 to transport a minivan and a station wagon
across the five-mile Vineyard Sound. That way we would never risk
remaining landlocked on a hot afternoon or even have to be ferried in
waves to the beach.</TE>
<TE>   The best advice for summer travelers is to book car ferry
reservations many months ahead for the day you need, even if the
specific departure time is bad. Then be prepared to call back
repeatedly to get better times. The natives are used to it, and it
works.</TE>
<TE>   Courtesy of the persistent efforts of my sister-in-law, Hedda, an
early morning reservation and a late evening reservation were finally
melded into two midafternoon reservations on the same boat. After
squeezing the vehicles aboard, we relaxed on deck for the calm,
45-minute ferry trip.</TE>
<TE>   From the deck, details of the compact, leafy island came quickly
into view. Although only 20 miles long, it includes a variety of
environments, from the quaint New England town of Edgartown to
Menemsha, a quintessential fishing village where Vineyard lobstermen
deliver their catch, and from the serene woods of the interior to the
crashing waves of the ocean-side beaches.</TE>
<TE>   When we arrived, one sticky detail remained: Who would stay in
which house? TV seemed to mark the line in the sand.</TE>
<TE>   Brother Marc and 5-year-old nephew Jason wanted nonstop sports. My
wife, Iris, preferred the TV off. There was a suggestion we should
designate one structure the girls' house and the other the boys'
house. Although the idea was nixed, it more or less worked out that
way anyhow because of the vagaries of modern technology: When Marc
realized the cable in the bigger house wasn't working, he bailed out
and headed to the other, nephew in tow. The two surfaced for meals
and swimming excursions but were otherwise happy to hang out at the
smaller house, visions of Red Sox lulling them to sleep.</TE>
<TE>   The first morning on the island was hot and humid. We packed tuna
and turkey sandwiches, the first of dozens we would make that week,
and headed for the water. For our debut trip, we decided to take the
easiest approach--the popular Joseph A. Sylvia Beach, a two-mile
stretch of open shore along the state road running between Oak Bluffs
and Edgartown. Sylvia Beach, which is on Nantucket Sound, is
decidedly family-friendly--gently sloped, with warm waters lapping
onto a sandy shore.</TE>
<TE>   Free parking along the main road left us only a few yards from
where we set down our towels. It was a joy for the children and their
parents. Moreover, the length of the beach, which has lifeguards on
the Edgartown side, meant there was ample room for such Kennedyesque
pursuits as tossing footballs along the shore.</TE>
<TE>   Later that day, back in West Tisbury, we launched two kayaks
(brought by Steve) into murky Tisbury Great Pond and paddled all the
way to an unprotected ocean beach, where Atlantic waves crashed
menacingly onto the sands.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning we again assembled sandwiches, threw them into
coolers and jumped into the cars. This time we were bound for
Menemsha. The town features seafood restaurants, an overpriced
antiques store and a beach. Although we had great fried clams at a
small clam shack called the Bite, we dubbed Menemsha Public Beach the
"Beach of Pain" because of the cold water and the rocks and shells
that made a run for the water feel more like a trip over broken
glass. The parking limit, three hours, seemed a blessing.</TE>
<TE>   We returned to Menemsha to eat more clams, but we kept our shoes
on and our swimsuits in the car.</TE>
<TE>   At midweek we undertook our biggest expedition, taking the tiny
ferry to Chappaquiddick.</TE>
<TE>   We were surprised when we got to the landing in Edgartown to board
the "On Time." It holds only three cars for a trip that takes just a
couple of minutes. You could almost spit a watermelon seed clear
across the bay--the same stretch that Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
(D-Mass.) said he swam after the auto accident in 1969 in which
28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne died.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving at the ferry around 10:30 a.m., we happily drove right
onto the boat, congratulating ourselves for getting out of the house
so early that we missed all the traffic. We hadn't noticed a second
line of cars that should have gone on ahead of us. People were
apparently too polite to scream as we paid our $5-per-car fee.</TE>
<TE>   Once on Chappaquiddick and somewhat embarrassed, it took us only a
couple of minutes to reach the turnoff for the infamous Dike Bridge.
We drove across it not for purposes of political research but because
it is the entry point to East Beach, a seven-mile barrier beach that
is part of the Cape Poge Wildlife Refuge.</TE>
<TE>   We paid the $4 per adult at a booth where attendants keep a
laminated copy of 3-decade-old Ted Kennedy headlines to help answer
the inevitable questions. From there we lugged our beach chairs and
coolers across a sand dune to the pristine shore.</TE>
<TE>   As at Sylvia, the water was warm, the waves and breezes gentle.
But here, bathers were few and far between because the sand went on
seemingly forever. It was deserted enough to feel practically
private.</TE>
<TE>   Before heading back toward Edgartown, we also checked out the
Wasque Reservation, another idyllic beach among the dunes, with
stronger Atlantic waves.</TE>
<TE>   It was now 4 p.m., rush hour for the ferry. We waited nearly an
hour to get back across to Edgartown--again, three cars at a time.</TE>
<TE>   During peak vacation season, it's much easier to visit
Chappaquiddick (or "Chappy," as the locals call it) by bicycle as
long as you're not packing young children or beach coolers.</TE>
<TE>   The next two days, we split up by beach preferences. Marc wanted
heavy surf and water deep enough for snorkeling, so he went to the
south-facing beaches of West Tisbury and Aquinnah, the town that
boasts the Gay Head Cliffs and lighthouse--a favorite sunset viewing
spot. At West Tisbury he got more than he bargained for, his face
mask and fins knocked right off his body and taken away by the
pounding surf.</TE>
<TE>   Steve and I drove the four young children to Uncle Seth's Pond,
the island's only public freshwater beach, between Vineyard Haven and
West Tisbury on Lambert's Cove Road.</TE>
<TE>   The old-fashioned swimming hole has bathwater temperatures,
chirping crickets, a sandy shore and floating weeds. Just as at East
Beach, there were few other bathers--but for a different reason.
There are about five legal parking spaces within walking distance of
the pond, so unless you get there early or take public
transportation, you're out of luck.</TE>
<TE>   We were lucky and found a spot. But Seth's Pond also will live in
our memories because it was there that we witnessed an extraordinary
act of police benevolence: When one car was deemed illegally parked
by the Vineyard police officer whose job it is to oversee such
matters, he walked over to each bather trying to find the owner.
Unsuccessful, he was seen walking off, muttering, "Well, I guess I
have to write a ticket." We almost felt sorry for him.</TE>
<TE>   That evening we concluded the ongoing birthday celebration for my
mother with a fine dinner of lobsters and steamers that we cooked up
in the larger of the two vacation homes. Instead of birthday cake, we
bought scrumptious homemade blueberry-peach and strawberry-rhubarb
pies from Eileen Blake's stand, along the state road between Vineyard
Haven and West Tisbury.</TE>
<TE>   It was now our final full day on the island, and we decided to go
swimming together one last time. So we returned to Sylvia, the beach
that offered the most for everyone. Marc snorkeled, the kids
splashed, Steve and I tossed Frisbees with Hedda and Iris, and my
mother and stepfather sat in beach chairs at the water's edge,
beaming with pride over their extended family.</TE>
<TE>   In the afternoon we split up, my family heading to Edgartown and
Oak Bluffs on a T-shirt shopping spree. Edgartown, with its tiny
brick and clapboard buildings, also houses many fancy boutiques,
several jewelry stores--such as Chica on North Water Street--that
sell one-of-a-kind pieces, and first-class restaurants such as
Alchemy, where we dined one night on lobster pie.</TE>
<TE>   Oak Bluffs, with its teeny, colorful gingerbread houses looking
out at the beachfront, has the look of a Victorian Lilliput. The
homes were built on the site of a religious campground, using as
their foundations the concrete slabs that once housed tents. They are
vividly painted, and rocking chairs abound on the many porches. The
shops are touristy but fun to roam through.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the afternoon we headed back toward our houses. But as we
passed Lambert's Cove Road, our car seemed to tug to the right. I
looked at my wife as the kids yelled "Let's go swimming!" and she
shrugged, knowing this was a battle not worth fighting.</TE>
<TE>   I turned the wheel and headed back toward Uncle Seth's Pond for
one last dip. Arriving shortly before the beach's 6 p.m. closing
time, we noticed three cars parked along the roadway. That meant
there was enough room for us. We also noticed that one of those
vehicles looked familiar. It was Steve's minivan. He and his family
had also decided to make a last stop at the old swimming hole.</TE>
<TE>   For a few more minutes, we tossed Frisbees as the children
frolicked, laughing, yelling and splashing. The sounds and spirit of
childhood emanated both from the setting and from a new generation of
our family. We set the camera on the self-timer and took one last
photo.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Wolfe wrote that you can't go home again. But here at the
pond, it sure felt as if you could.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: In Lee Vining, Calif., Los Angeles reader Vera Erling
photographed this spiked-hair punk hitching a ride toward Mono Lake.
Well, almost. The Steller's jay wasn't so much hitchhiking as it was
resting on an abandoned pickup behind the Yosemite Gateway Motel.
Because Erling forgot to change settings on her point-and-shoot, a
bird portrait accidentally became a panoramic, taken as she drove by.

<HD>May the Road Rise With Volunteers Who Adopt a California
Highway</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SPANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This summer, as more Americans hit the road for vacation, it seems
appropriate to think about the scenic byways they'll be taking, like
the Pacific Coast Highway in Big Sur and U.S. Highway 395 below the
eastern flank of the High Sierra. To my mind, they aren't just roads
through the state; they are routes to the heart.</LD>
<LD>   So it appalls me to think of people who despoil them by throwing
cigarette butts, beer cans and hamburger wrappers out the window.
Plenty of Californians are doing something about it by participating
in the Adopt-a-Highway program. It lets individuals, groups and
businesses contract with the state to maintain a stretch of highway,
typically two miles long, for two years. This chiefly involves
removing litter, saving taxpayers about $5 million, program
administrators say. The state provides trash bags and safety training
for participants, and "adoptive parents" are recognized by a sign on
their stretch of road.</LD>
<LD>   Jan Davidson of Fish Camp, Calif., just south of Yosemite National
Park, adopted a part of California Highway 41 near Fresno in 1999. "I
had no idea what a job it would be," says Davidson, who once suffered
heatstroke while gathering trash on the roadside.</LD>
<TE>   The first time she and her husband, Don, visited their assigned
area, they each collected 101 bags of litter in 28 1/2 hours. After
that, there were just 15 to 20 bags of litter to collect six times a
year. Davidson also works with the House Rabbit Society, which finds
foster parents for abandoned bunnies, especially after Easter. She
got involved in the Adopt-a-Highway program when she realized it
could help her promote rabbit rescue.</TE>
<TE>   The sign on the stretch of Highway 41 in Fish Camp she maintains
says its adopter is the South Yosemite Chapter of the House Rabbit
Society. Since it went up, Davidson says she has received lots of
calls about the organization. One Easter she did a cleanup wearing
rabbit ears. A car stopped, and the children inside yelled, "Look,
it's the Easter bunny!"</TE>
<TE>   The Adopt-a-Highway program started in 1985 in Texas, which still
has one of the country's most vigorous volunteer
highway-beautification efforts. Its annual Trash-Off liberated Texas
highways of 2 million pounds of litter last year.</TE>
<TE>   California got Adopt-a-Highway in 1989 but put a new twist on the
program by authorizing a few companies, like the Adopt-a-Highway
Maintenance Corp. in Costa Mesa, to do the cleanup and beautification
work for a fee. The clients of such companies are generally big
corporations (and stars like Fess Parker, Robin Williams and Bette
Midler) who can pay $325 to $450 a month to have a stretch of highway
professionally cleaned. For instance, Midler sponsored litter removal
on a section of the Ventura Freeway, and Rayne Water Systems, an
Irvine company, pays the Adopt-a-Highway Maintenance Corp. to clean
up the Jamboree Road interchange on southbound Interstate 405 in
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Contractors, which maintain about a fourth of the state's
Adopt-a-Highway segments, are most active on busy arteries in
metropolitan areas. In the L.A. area, Interstates 405 and 10, U.S.
Highway 101 and California Highway 134 are particularly sought after
by corporate sponsors. "It's difficult to expect volunteers to go out
on heavily trafficked highways where cars go 60 to 100 mph," says
Patricia Nelson, vice president of Adopt-a-Highway Maintenance Corp.
Liability is an issue, and volunteers would have a hard time doing
the upkeep that professional cleaners can provide, she says.</TE>
<TE>   In more rural areas, groups and individual volunteers predominate.
Barry Kaufman, a professional musician, started cleaning a
grapevine-lined stretch of U.S. Highway 101 south of San Luis Obispo
in 1991. His sign was good marketing for his music-making, and he
liked the outdoor exercise the work provided.</TE>
<TE>   When his mother discovered that some highway adopters pay
companies to do the cleanup for them, Kaufman decided to get into the
business to augment his income as a strolling mandolin player.
Working on his own, Kaufman makes about $2,000 a month collecting
trash for 14 clients.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the satisfaction he gets from knowing he's helping keep
the environment clean, the job has other benefits. "On a regular
basis, I have the opportunity to perform good deeds by returning
things to their owners," Kaufman says. These include checks, purses,
wallets and vehicle registrations.</TE>
<TE>   Kaufman and Davidson are dismayed the most by the alcoholic
beverage bottles and cans they find on the roadside. Thankfully, they
haven't come across any body parts. But Davidson once found $120
hanging on a bush, prompting her to tell her husband that money grows
on bushes, not trees.</TE>
<TE>   These two volunteers have had time to speculate on why people
trash the highways. Some of the littering is unintentional, they say.
But they think most of it stems from laziness and disrespect.
"There's a littering state of mind," Kaufman says, "a disregard for
the environment and others."</TE>
<TE>   And here's what happens: "The trash just adds up," says Terri
Porter, program coordinator for California Adopt-a-Highway. "We don't
seem to be able to keep up with it."</TE>
<TE>   In the L.A. area, outlying sections of Interstates 210 and 710 and
State Highways 2 and 57 are crying out for adoptive parents. They may
not be as scenic as PCH, but California is a beauty from border to
border. So who knows how they would look with a little tender loving
care?</TE>

<DL>STEKENE, Belgium</DL>
<LD>"I just love that Neil Armstrong."</LD>
<LD>   At first it was hard to understand what the elegantly dressed
woman was getting at. She had just walked out of a party across the
road and sat down beside me on an old stone wall in the middle of
Belgian farmland, 10 miles west of Antwerp.</LD>
<LD>   Clutching a glass of red wine in one hand and an expensive-looking
sweater in the other, she seemed out of place--and way
overdressed--amid the hundreds of working-class people who lined the
street, many of them wearing cycling gear (me included). Having
abandoned work, school and other responsibilities on a Monday last
July, most of us were content to sit quietly and wait. But the woman,
perhaps to be polite, perhaps to pass the time, was trying to strike
up a conversation. She seemed to be searching for something that a
Belgian and an American might have in common.</LD>
<TE>   Nice thought. Wrong guy.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, it was cyclist Lance Armstrong who rocketed along that
road 25 minutes later--amid the race entourage that included three
low-flying helicopters; motorcycles bearing TV and still
photographers; a parade of 100 or so Fiats loaded with officials,
journalists, coaches and extra bicycles; and more than a few
emergency vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong blurred past us in a streak of color, whipping around a
C-shaped turn as he battled with the rest of the nearly 200 cyclists
who made up the field at last year's Tour de France, a
more-than-2,000-mile bicycle race that captivates much of the world
for three weeks each summer.</TE>
<TE>   For Europeans, the Tour de France is the Super Bowl, college
basketball's Final Four and the Boston Marathon all wrapped into one.
It is part carnival, part commercial promotion and more than a little
athletic display. Cyclists from all over the world compete to wear
the fabled yellow jersey by putting themselves through a series of 20
grueling stages that can stretch more than 145 miles in a single day.</TE>
<TE>   For cycling fans--and my husband, Shawn, and I fall into that
category--seeing the Tour de France in person is a pilgrimage.
Unsatisfied with the abbreviated coverage then available on cable TV,
we undertook a journey last summer to follow part of the Tour route,
sometimes by car and sometimes on our bicycles. Getting a place along
the route was easier than we had expected, and we were rewarded with
a chance to experience firsthand the full extent of Tour mania.</TE>
<TE>   That day in the Belgian farmland, Armstrong and the other cyclists
rode so close to us that we could have touched them, were they not
moving at breakneck pace, a half-hour from the finish line in a
135-mile stage. For these front-row seats, we paid nothing--but got a
chance to see the spectacle as the locals do, in the middle of
farmland, complete with cows standing watch as racers passed along
country roads.</TE>
<TE>   Our trip to this Tour, which Armstrong would go on to win,
inspired our athletic pursuits for months to come--and gave us a
better understanding of how our favorite sport is celebrated in the
rest of the world.</TE>
<TE>   Because of our vacation schedules, we chose to visit the Tour in
its first week. After flying into Paris, we spent a few days in the
French countryside near Bordeaux, where we got in a little relaxation
and a good deal of bike riding before the main event.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on the Tour's first official day of racing, we drove back to
Paris and traveled north to catch Stages 2 and 3 of the Tour as it
briefly crossed into Belgium. With travel time, we spent almost three
days following the Tour before returning to Paris for some more
sightseeing and the trip home.</TE>
<TE>   We had decided months before to take our bicycles--a choice that
required a little bit of packing know-how but for which we were
rewarded. Having bicycles with us allowed us freedom of movement;
along the race route, we were able to move up and down the course
with relative ease.</TE>
<TE>   And so we disassembled our bikes, packed them in hard cases and
sent them through as checked baggage at no extra charge. (Many
airlines allow travelers to check bike boxes or cases as long as they
are one of only two checked bags.)</TE>
<TE>   To make travel on the other end easier, we requested a station
wagon from our car rental company. For a small extra fee, we received
a minivan that was large enough to accommodate the bikes, their cases
and the cases of wine we bought along the way.</TE>
<TE>   We mapped our journey using the Tour Web site (www.letour.fr),
which provides a detailed description of the route well in advance,
and its official program, which we purchased at a newsstand near
Paris. We planned to stay in Antwerp, a city that hosted a stage
finish one day and a departure the next, and from there, to visit
towns a few kilometers from the stages' start and finish lines.</TE>
<TE>   Because almost 4,000 people, including support staff, sponsors and
journalists, travel with the riders, hotel rooms are often scarce in
the start and finish cities of each day's stage. But they seemed
plentiful at cities in between, and last year, we booked rooms up
until a month before the Tour began.</TE>
<TE>   We didn't count on the extraordinary summer rains that closed the
A1, the main artery from Paris to Antwerp, and the serpentine detour
that caused traffic backups for miles in each direction. Well before
our destination, we pulled off the road in a small French town called
Noyon--birthplace of theologian John Calvin and home to the stunning
cathedral of Notre-Dame, a 12th century Romanesque-Gothic building
restored after it was damaged in World War I.</TE>
<TE>   Across from the cathedral, we found Le Cedre, a hospitable 35-room
hotel with a buffet breakfast that featured the best muesli we had in
France and equally delicious croissants. Le Noviomagus, an elegant
restaurant, had an excellent prix fixe menu featuring regional
specialties, including the poulet braise (chicken), rice and fruit
tart we tried.</TE>
<TE>   As serendipity would have it, Stage 5 of this year's Tour passed
close to Noyon. Although the route changes significantly from year to
year, the racers circumnavigate France, traveling clockwise around
the country in odd-numbered years and counterclockwise in even years,
often dipping into a nearby country--the 2002 Tour began in
Luxembourg--and sometimes requiring air or train transfer. Some
stages, including the epic climb up l'Alpe d'Huez, the team time
trial and the final stage, which finishes on the Champs-Elysees in
Paris, are fixtures.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving Noyon, we drove the rest of the way, through mostly
industrial towns with small city centers crowded around the highway,
toward Antwerp. We parked our van about 15 miles outside the city in
the town of Beveren, in one of the plentiful free lots near the
course, which was well marked with Tour logos. It was about three
hours before the anticipated arrival of the riders. (The Tour
program, which sold last year for about $4, details the route of each
stage, anticipating the approximate arrival time of the riders and
their entourage to each city. Local newspapers had good maps as well;
we relied on the Gazet Van Antwerpen to guide us in and out of the
city on stage days.)</TE>
<TE>   From Beveren we rode 18 miles of the course--which remains open at
most points to foot traffic and bicycles until about an hour before
the riders' arrival--in reverse, stopping along the way to buy lunch,
baguette sandwiches and drinks from a street vendor for just a few
dollars. (Charging exorbitant fees for food at sporting events did
not seem to be in the Belgian mind-set.) We ate along the side of the
road in the farmland outside Stekene before the racers arrived.</TE>
<TE>   A tour of the route could be as brief as an hour or two, but
spending an entire day is a chance to experience a sporting event
like no other and to live, for a few hours, as a local, no matter
where you are. Taking in all of the sights was as much a part of the
journey as watching the riders pass--and tourists are welcomed into
the festivities.</TE>
<TE>   In smaller Belgian towns like Vrasene, Sint-Gillis-Waas and
Bilzen, the wait for the arrival of the riders took on a Mardi
Gras-like atmosphere, as people hauled big-screen TVs into the street
and neighbors huddled around radios listening for updates as the race
moved toward them. Community groups grilled sausages for
fund-raisers; bakeries sold sandwiches out of carts. Beer gardens
were everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Both days, we staked out spots along the route, the first day
sitting near a well-appointed house hosting a fete for 50 or so
outside Stekene; the second, outside Bistro-Ellen, an outdoor cafe in
Bilzen. It was along a straightaway inside what's called the "feed
zone," the area in which team coaches provide their riders with water
and food about halfway through each stage.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the towns we encountered along the route, including
Stekene and Bilzen, had small city centers along the main road, with
a pub or two, a series of commercial buildings and little more.</TE>
<TE>   After seeing the tour in Stekene, we spent a night in Antwerp,
where we parked a few blocks from the hotel and crowded all of our
luggage, including the bikes, into a small hotel room. Although the
Hotel Agora, booked on the Internet in advance, was a disappointment,
it did have a terrific view of the plaza across from Antwerp's train
station and the hotel where many of the teams were staying. (We got
in a few good cyclist sightings from our hotel window.)</TE>
<TE>   Before dinner at a local grill, where we feasted on Belgian
frites, we cruised the streets of Antwerp on foot and found traces of
the Tour everywhere, especially near the center of town.</TE>
<TE>   An elaborate finish-line area, complete with massage booths for
the athletes and a press center where they could get almost any
newspaper in the world, was being turned into a starting line for the
next day.</TE>
<TE>   In sharp contrast to the finish-line bleacher seats, which are
often reserved for the VIPs of a particular community, the common
people prevailed farther out from the big cities along the route.
Some pedaled, like us, on bicycles; others sat in well-appointed
restaurants and waited for the main show to arrive, getting up from
their chairs only to buy T-shirts, baseball caps and umbrellas
emblazoned with the circular Tour de France logo from passing vans.</TE>
<TE>   Flags are flown from buildings, mannequins are dressed in cycling
jerseys and streets are painted with messages from fans to their
favorite riders. One German fan, Didi Senft, known in racing circles
as "the Devil," has become such a fixture on the Tour that he has
sponsorship from an auto-parts maker. Dressed in a red bodysuit,
sporting a helmet with horns and a red-and-yellow pitchfork
emblazoned with "Le Tour de France" along its base, Senft travels the
Tour in a Volkswagen van. He paints three pitchforks on the cement
near where he stands along the route.</TE>
<TE>   The straightaway proved the ideal spot for greeting what amounts
to the pre-game show: a 20-minute parade of sponsor vehicles called
the Publicity Caravan, where excess is king and invention is key. The
2001 caravan included a 25-foot-tall statue of a cyclist atop a
dune-buggy-like contraption; a fleet of test motorcycles driven by
models; and three white minivans, laden with lettuce, cheeses, bread
and other staples in super-size shopping carts on their roof and
manned by employees of Champion, a French supermarket chain.</TE>
<TE>   Most vehicles in the caravan toss paraphernalia to the crowds as
they pass. Last year we caught, among other things, a specially
designed bottle of water; a madeleine cookie; a sample of a new kind
of sausage; key chains; hats; CD cases; and an oversized bright green
cardboard "hand" from PMU, a horse race betting company that sponsors
the Tour's green jersey, given to the best sprinter among the racers.
You'll spot the hands, similar to the foam versions you might see at
a Dodgers game, at every point along the route, and we felt
fashionable just being able to wave one aloft as the riders passed.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 minutes after the caravan had passed us, we got our first
glimpse of the approaching procession; off in the distance,
helicopters hovering low to capture the riders' approach for a TV
audience began to move slowly toward us.</TE>
<TE>   A parade of official, media and team cars appeared along the route
soon after, zipping along at up to 70 mph as they raced to get into
position at the stage's finish line. And then, finally, the riders
themselves. The first day, two groups of riders that had broken away
from the main pack (called a peloton in cycling) rode by us first,
jockeying for position as they sped toward the finish line.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, we watched a rider go on the attack as he tried to
use the relaxed pace of the peloton within the feed zone to his
advantage. In both cases, I held my breath as the racers passed,
trying to recognize riders by their colorful team uniforms and by the
prize jerseys--yellow, green and polka-dot--worn by the leaders in
the overall time, sprinting and hill-climb categories, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Because we chose to see the Tour in its first week, when racers
typically compete on flat, quick courses, the pack passed by us
relatively fast. Traveling to one of the shorter time-trial or hill
stages affords a greater chance of seeing riders pass one at a time.
But crowds along the routes that we chose were more spread out than
they might have been at one of the famed mountain stages.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as the last stragglers--racers who had been caught behind
crashes earlier in the day, and a handful of emergency
vehicles--passed us by, we crowded into a nearby pub to watch the end
of the race. Our first day, Belgian cyclist and hometown hero Marc
Wauters won the stage and the yellow leader's jersey; people poured
out into the streets afterward to celebrate his victory.</TE>
<TE>   By the time we returned home, we were hooked on the drama that is
the Tour. I found myself doing whatever I could to arrive at the
newsstand near my house just in time to buy a day-old version of
L'Equipe for race coverage. We trolled the Internet and became
connoisseurs of the many French sites that offer start-to-finish
coverage of each day's race.</TE>
<TE>   The PMU hand, one of the many souvenirs that survived the trip
home, is now affixed to the wall of our garage. Every time I guide my
bike down the driveway, I stop for a moment before beginning my ride.
I imagine that I am back on that European road--and that the crowds
are cheering for me, waving their Kelly green hands.</TE>

<TE>   Guidebook: Taking In the Tour</TE>
<TE>   Getting there: The Tour route varies from year to year, but it's
usually best to fly into Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris and then
drive the rest of the way from there. From LAX, nonstop service is
available to Paris on Air France and Air Tahiti Nui, and direct
service is offered on US Airways. Restricted round-trip fares begin
at $1,177.</TE>
<TE>   Most major airlines allow you to take a bike, packed in a bicycle
box or case, as your second checked piece of luggage at no extra
charge.</TE>
<TE>   To accommodate our two bikes and their cases, we needed an
oversized car, which can be hard to find in Europe. We went with Auto
Europe, (800) 223-5555, www.autoeurope.com, and ended up with a
minivan; with the seats folded down in back, our gear fit snugly. A
minivan rents for about $680 a week.</TE>
<TE>   Telephones: To call the numbers below from the U.S., dial 011 (the
international dialing code).</TE>
<TE>   Where to stay: We stayed at Hotel Le Cedre, 8 Rue de l'Eveche,
60400 Noyon, France; 333-4444-2324, fax 333-4409- 5379,
www.hotel-lecedre.com.</TE>
<TE>   It is across from the town's beautiful cathedral. The room was
sparsely decorated, but the employees' hospitality--and the generous
breakfast buffet--more than made up for it. A double room costs
$55-$65; breakfast is about $6.</TE>
<TE>   Where to eat: Le Noviomagus, 8 Rue de l'Eveche, Noyon,
333-4493-3399, is next door to Le Cedre and across from the Noyon
cathedral. It offers traditional meals. We had chicken with rice and
a fruit tart for dessert, about $40 for two.</TE>
<TE>   Along the route, we had a delightful meal at Bistro-Ellen, 72
Hasseltsestraat, Bilzen, Belgium, 32-8941-2301. Skip the more
serious-looking restaurant in favor of the outdoor cafe; the soup of
the day, served with fresh bread, was wonderful, as was the lasagna
Bolognese, served straight out of the oven. Lunch for two ran about
$25.</TE>
<TE>   Other resources for watching the Tour: An American-based Web site,
www.Velovista.net, provides detailed information for planning your
own cycling trip.</TE>
<TE>   If you want to visit the Tour by bicycle but prefer to have
someone else organize it, several package tours are available. Some
require you to bring your own bike or rent one; others will provide
one as part of the package. Most have mechanics and easy
transportation of bikes from one site to another. Among the U.S.
choices:</TE>
<TE>   Breaking Away, (310) 545-5118, fax (310) 545-6625,
www.breakingaway.com, has been organizing cycling vacations for
almost 20 years. It takes participants to watch and ride parts of the
Tour and finishes in Paris with a grandstand viewing of the final
stage. A 12-day trip, for intermediate to advanced riders, runs
$3,298 plus air fare.</TE>
<TE>   Backroads, (800) GO-ACTIVE (462-2848), fax (510) 527-1444,
www.backroads.com, an "active travel" company, offers a similar
nine-day tour, also $3,298 plus air fare. This year the group meets
in Avignon on July 20 and travels the Tour route back to Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Golden Adventures, (214) 522-1217, fax (253) 541-7483,
www.goldenadventures.com/FRANCE.htm, offers an eight-day tour. For
$2,150 plus air fare, guests get the use of hybrid bicycles and a
shared laptop computer, with a personalized e-mail address, for
sending digital photos home.</TE>
<TE>   The French magazine Velo hosts "L'Etape du Tour" (The Tour Stage),
www.letapedutour.com, each year in anticipation of the main event.
For about $45, cyclists can compete in an entire stage (this year,
Stage 17 on July 22) three days before the Tour racers arrive. All
7,500 places in the "Etape" race, which draws an international
following, had been reserved by February of this year.</TE>

<HD>Visiting Backpackers Are Getting a First-Rate G'Day in
Australia</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Australia is one of the more welcoming countries for budget
travelers. Although some tourism officials in other parts of the
world lament that cost-conscious travelers don't spend much money,
Australia has proved the opposite is true, at least Down Under.</LD>
<LD>   Backpackers actually contribute more to the economy than
short-term, big-spending tourists, according to a recent report in
the Sydney Morning Herald. A backpacker, the Australian Bureau of
Statistics says, is someone who stays at least one night in a budget
hostel.</LD>
<LD>   The studies conducted by Australian Bureau of Statistics found:</LD>
<TE>   * Backpackers make up the fastest-growing segment of the tourism
market in Australia. The average backpacker on a visa that permits
work spends about $4,500, compared with $2,100 for the average
tourist who stays in a hotel.</TE>
<TE>   * In Australia, about 8,000 people are employed in housing,
feeding and transporting the estimated 400,000 backpackers who visit
each year.</TE>
<TE>   * Backpackers also tend to spread their money in other markets,
not just to dive operators, bus companies and rafting specialists but
also to grocery stores, gas stations and pubs.</TE>
<TE>   With that kind of impact, it's not surprising that a significant
tourism industry has developed to serve backpackers. Here's a
sampling of services:</TE>
<TE>   Wayward Bus (www.waywardbus.com.au), a small, independent tour
operator with a good reputation among travelers, helps backpackers
explore a new region, then drops them at their next destination.
Travel is by 16- to 22-passenger vehicles. There are no age
restrictions, but most passengers are in their 20s and 30s.</TE>
<TE>   The company offers tours to Kangaroo Island and Alice Springs,
among other places. One of its most popular routes is the 3 1/2-day
trip between Melbourne and Adelaide, which includes the scenic Great
Ocean Road. Departures are at least once a week year-round. Tours
cost about $177 and include three nights' stay in a hostel, three
breakfasts, three lunches and entry to national parks.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, Pioneering Spirit has shuttled small groups of
backpackers on three-day journeys from Sydney up the east coast to
Byron Bay, one of Australia's favorite surfing destinations. Along
the route you may spot whales, dolphins, kangaroos and wallabies.
Pioneering Spirit's next round of tours starts Aug. 9.</TE>
<TE>   This small company will take up to 21 passengers at a time, with
stops for wine tastings in the Hunter Valley, rain-forest walks,
surfing, rafting and sea kayaking at Coffs Harbour and visits to a
volunteer-run koala hospital at Port Macquarie. Overnight stays are
at homesteads and pubs (twin rooms). The trip costs $145. Call
011-61-2-6685-7721 or visit www.pioneeringspirit.com.au.</TE>
<TE>   YHA Australia, which is affiliated with the worldwide Hostelling
International, has more than 150 locations providing low-cost
lodgings in renovated hotels, guest houses, farms and schools. Some
are in gateway cities, others in rural areas and places of historical
significance.</TE>
<TE>   Nightly rates are $6 to $14 for a bed in a shared room. Many also
have twin, double and family rooms available. On the YHA Web site,
www.yha.org.au, you can get details on packages that combine
accommodations and transportation. For example, you can purchase a
three-month pass for Greyhound bus transportation from Sydney to
Cairns and vouchers for 10 nights' YHA accommodation in a shared room
for $291. This offer is valid until March 31. Don't purchase too many
voucher nights ahead of your departure, because in some towns you may
want to stay somewhere other than a YHA.</TE>
<TE>   Oz Experience (www.ozexperience.com) is the big gorilla when it
comes to backpacker bus services in Australia. This hop-on-hop-off
service has a variety of routes, some to popular destinations and
some off the beaten track. The buses stop for activities, and the
driver-guides will book budget accommodations and drop off and pick
up passengers at hostels. Passes are sold in Australia and through
many North American student travel services, such as STA Travel;
(800) 781-4040, www.statravel.com.</TE>
<TE>   For young travelers heading to Switzerland this summer, the
beautiful lakeside city of Geneva, home to the European offices of
the United Nations and the International Red Cross, is again offering
free youth information services. If you want help with accommodation
or sightseeing, look for the youth information bus parked across from
the city's rail station.</TE>

<HD>A Smile at the Door</HD>
<DH>Movie-makers get caught up in the spirit of Bill Porter, a
salesman who fought cerebral palsy with each step.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William H. Macy describes his latest project, "Door to Door," which
premieres Sunday on TNT, as a "gentle tale of a gentle man."</LD>
<LD>   That man is Bill Porter, a door-to-door salesman for the Watkins
Co. in Portland, Ore. Born with cerebral palsy, he was unemployable
for many years. But thanks to his mother's determination and love and
his own unflagging spirit, Porter found work as a salesman and has
been at it for more than 40 years.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the pain he endured because of his affliction, he managed
to walk eight to 10 miles a day selling products--everything from
laundry soap to dog biscuits. Now 69, he sells Watkins products at
his Web site, www.billporter.com.</LD>
<TE>   Besides starring as Porter, Macy wrote the film with director
Steven Schachter. They had written several movies together, including
the TNT thriller "A Slight Case of Murder." With that history, Macy
thought the cable outlet would welcome them back with "Door to Door."</TE>
<TE>   He got a surprise. "They didn't want to do it," Macy says. "So we
went to HBO, and HBO bought the pitch. Then when we wrote it, they
said, 'No, it is far too soft for us.' We went back to TNT and the
second time they said yes."</TE>
<TE>   Macy calls Porter "one of the most extraordinary men" he's ever
met. "What I noticed immediately when I met him was that he was just
smiling all the time. Usually, the first thing out of his mouth was a
laugh. He has a great humor toward the world. He has a twinkle in his
eye. It's so disarming."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the fact that "Door to Door" is gentle, it is not a
cloying, overly sentimental, disease-of-the-week movie. "We tried to
bring humor to it," Schachter says. "This guy is such a quietly
heroic character and a positive spirit, there wasn't really anything
to weep about."</TE>
<TE>   Finding a hook into his story was a challenge for the writers. "It
is sort of like telling a story about a milkman or a mailman,"
Schachter says. "They go from door to door and then they go home."</TE>
<TE>   "We had this great character and we had some high points," Macy
adds. "His life was not without interest or drama, but there is no
punch line to the story--there was no third act. So it became clear
that a good way to tell the story would be to 'Forrest Gump' it a
bit."</TE>
<TE>   Porter, they surmised, must have had a long-lasting effect on the
lives of his clients. "So that broke the story for us--let's tell the
dramas of the people on the route, the people he sold to," says Macy.
Though the high points of Porter's life in the film are true, says
Macy, all of the clients depicted are fictional.</TE>
<TE>   British actress Helen Mirren plays Porter's strong-willed mother,
who impressed upon her son that nothing was impossible, and Kyra
Sedgwick is Shelly Brady, a spunky housewife and mother who has
worked as Porter's assistant for nearly 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Schachter says that they sent the script to plenty of American
actresses to play Porter's mother. "When we said, 'Would you like to
play Bill Macy's mother?,' you could hear the phones hanging up
around L.A. What was great about Helen is that a lot of English
actors--the tradition they come from is perhaps a little less from
the vanity school and a little bit more from the 'muck in there and
be an actor school.' "</TE>
<TE>   Sedgwick sees "Door to Door" as a great metaphor for the "things
that are lost in our culture, that kind of intimacy you got when you
were working with someone and buying a product you would be using in
your home. You've got to know the person, and the person has got to
know you. I think that kind of relationship has gone the way of all
flesh in our fast world. Our world is all about the big stores and
getting things as fast as possible. It's really sad."</TE>
<TE>   If there is such a thing as karma, says Macy, Porter exudes it.
"He certainly puts out great things--he puts out trust and humor and
stoicism and kindness and acceptance. As a result, good stuff has
come back to him."</TE>
<TE>   "Door to Door" can be seen Sunday at 8, 10 and midnight on TNT. It
repeats Wednesday at 9 p.m. and Saturday at 12:30 p.m. The network
has rated it TV-PG-L (may be unsuitable for young children, with an
advisory for coarse language).</TE>

<HD>Determined D.A. Harbors No Doubt About Murder</HD>
<DH>Justice: Victoria Banks had been sterilized, yet she'd said
she was pregnant. Did she kill the infant, or did it ever exist?</DH>
<SE>Second in a weekly series</SE>
<AU>MICHAEL LUO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUTLER, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Dist. Atty. Bobby Keahey studied the wildly different, ever-changing
statements the three mentally retarded murder suspects had made to
police. In them, he found a pattern.</LD>
<LD>   At one time or another, all three said they heard a baby cry.</LD>
<LD>   When they weren't denying the baby was born, they all said it was
a boy.</LD>
<TE>   And at one time or another, all three mentioned the baby's being
wrapped in a blue blanket (although in some statements, the blanket
was yellow and in others it was blue and yellow, and in still others
it was a towel).</TE>
<TE>   What are the chances of all three suspects mentioning those same
three things when they were questioned separately, Keahey asked in a
recent interview. "If you could do that, you could pick three numbers
on the lottery." (Police records show, however, that two of the
suspects were questioned together at least once and that, between
interrogations, two of them talked together about the case in their
cells.)</TE>
<TE>   True, there were some holes in the case. No body had been found.
There was no physical evidence of a murder, or even of a birth. And
five years earlier, Victoria Banks had undergone a tubal ligation,
making it unlikely she could have conceived the child she and two
others were suspected of killing.</TE>
<TE>   But according to Keahey, he had no reservations about the
evidence, no doubt that the three suspects were guilty.</TE>
<TE>   He brought capital murder charges against Victoria Banks, her
sister Dianne Tucker, and Banks' estranged husband, Medell. (Nearly
two years would pass before the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, last month,
that executing retarded people is unconstitutional.)</TE>
<TE>   Victoria Banks, already serving 15 years on an unrelated charge,
was sent to the death row unit of Tutwiler State Prison for Women,
standard procedure in Alabama for those charged with crimes
punishable by execution. She shared the cellblock with a woman who
had shot a policeman.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 27, 2000, Victoria Banks returned to Butler for her murder
trial at the Choctaw County Courthouse. The three-story brick
building sits in the middle of town. A statue of a Confederate
soldier stands guard on the courthouse lawn. Across the street is the
Dixie Gas Station, which displays the Rebel flag.</TE>
<TE>   A few years earlier, some townsfolk proposed adding another
monument to the courthouse lawn. They wanted to honor a civil rights
protester who had been run down by a white driver right in front of
the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   The board of county commissioners rejected the idea in a 3-2 vote,
all three white members voting no. One of them said he feared the
monument might stir racial tensions.</TE>
<TE>   Now it was the Banks murder case that was making folks uneasy.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a white sheriff, a white D.A., a white judge," said
Tommy Campbell, editor and lone reporter at the Choctaw Advocate.
"The defendants, they're all black, mentally retarded, poor,
indigent."</TE>
<TE>   Victoria Banks entered the courtroom in clothes borrowed from her
lawyer's wife. She followed her attorneys' directions, looking at the
jurors and keeping her hands folded in her lap.</TE>
<TE>   She stood trial alone, with Medell Banks and Dianne Tucker
scheduled to be tried later.</TE>
<TE>   Among the witnesses for the prosecution were the two evangelists
who had visited Victoria Banks in jail. The young women were positive
she had been pregnant. They came across as smart, honest and
convincing.</TE>
<TE>   Would such testimony convince jurors that Victoria Banks had
become pregnant despite her tubal ligation--that she was the one
woman in 100 whose tubes grow back together after the procedure?</TE>
<TE>   A simple medical test could show for sure whether her tubes were
still blocked. If they were, her lawyers thought, she would almost
certainly be acquitted. But what if the test showed the tubes had
reopened? That might be enough to send her to the electric chair.</TE>
<TE>   Weighing the risks and benefits of learning the truth, defense
lawyers decided it was too big a risk to take.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth day of the trial was devoted to tape recordings of
Victoria Banks' conflicting denials and confessions, made during the
weeks she was questioned without the advice of a lawyer. With the
jury absent, Circuit Court Judge Harold Crow spent several hours
listening to the scratchy audio and then to lawyers debating whether
they should be admitted into evidence.</TE>
<TE>   The issue was undecided as court adjourned for the evening.
Keahey, the prosecutor, approached Spencer Walker, a defense lawyer,
in the hallway and offered a deal:</TE>
<TE>   Banks could plead guilty to manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   She would be sentenced to 15 years, to be served concurrently with
her conviction for helping her abusive boyfriend rape her daughter.
That meant she wouldn't have to serve a single additional day in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   But, as a condition of the plea agreement, she would have to
declare that she had given birth and that her sister and estranged
husband had been present.</TE>
<TE>   Walker weighed the odds. Accepting the plea would remove the risk
that Victoria Banks might be sentenced to life in prison, or even
executed.</TE>
<TE>   However, it would undermine Medell Banks' and Dianne Tucker's
defense.</TE>
<TE>   Walker didn't represent them. It was Victoria Banks' interest he
was duty-bound to protect.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, he explained the offer as best he could to his
client. She asked a few tentative questions but didn't seem to
agonize. He gave her the weekend to be sure.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 4, 2000, Victoria Banks stood before the judge and mumbled
her acceptance of the guilty plea.</TE>
<TE>   Several months later, Medell Banks, accompanied by several of his
relatives, sat in a small conference room at the courthouse to
consider a deal Keahey had for him.</TE>
<TE>   Medell Banks' court-appointed lawyer, Rick Hutchinson, had never
handled a capital murder case before. His practice consisted largely
of Social Security law. But the devout Seventh-day Adventist harbored
a deep belief in individual rights and social justice.</TE>
<TE>   This case wasn't about justice, he told his client. It was about
figuring the odds.</TE>
<TE>   There is little evidence that you committed a crime, Hutchinson
said, speaking slowly to help his client understand. Medell Banks had
spent 12 years in special education and his IQ was just slightly
higher than his wife's.</TE>
<TE>   But juries can be hard to predict, Hutchinson said. There is
always a chance you could be found guilty. If that happens,
Hutchinson said, you will probably be sentenced to life in prison
without parole.</TE>
<TE>   You can remove that risk, the lawyer continued, by accepting the
prosecutor's deal and pleading guilty to the lesser charge of
manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   Circuit Court Judge Lee McPhearson would sentence you to no less
than 10 years and no more than 15, Hutchinson said. Because of prison
overcrowding, well behaved Alabama inmates typically serve about a
third of their sentences before being paroled. And the 22 months you
have spent in prison awaiting trail would count as part of your
sentence, he told his client.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchinson used a yellow legal pad to do the math. Accept the
plea, he told Medell Banks, and you could be out of prison in 18
months, or at worst in 38 months.</TE>
<TE>   The defendant and his family members spent two hours talking about
what to do, weighing the odds. Several times the defendant wept, his
relatives recalled later.</TE>
<TE>   Medell Banks kept bringing up his son from a previous marriage. If
he gambled and lost, he might never see the boy again. It was a risk
he just couldn't take.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting ready to say I'm guilty for something I didn't do,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   His co-defendant, Dianne Tucker, was offered the same deal. After
a similar discussion with her lawyer, she made the same decision.</TE>
<TE>   On May 7, 2001, they both stood before Judge McPhearson and
pleaded guilty.</TE>
<TE>   The judge rejected the 10-year sentence their lawyers had hoped
for and imposed 15 years. The fate of the three mentally retarded
defendants, it seemed, was settled.</TE>
<TE>   But Hutchinson, Medell Banks' lawyer, wasn't ready to give up. He
had one last card to play.</TE>
<TE>   The medical test that would determine once and for all if Victoria
Banks' tubal ligation remained intact was too much of a risk when she
was on trial for her life, but there was nothing to lose now.</TE>
<TE>   Last July, Victoria Banks lay on an examination table at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham as a doctor injected dye into her
uterus.</TE>
<TE>   If the dye spread from her uterus, through the fallopian tubes, to
her ovaries--a distance of 4 inches--it would mean Victoria Banks
could conceive and give birth. But if the dye stopped in the tubes,
it would mean the tubal ligation was still intact.</TE>
<TE>   On a TV monitor, the dye was a ghostly black against the white of
Victoria Banks' internal organs. Three lives depended on this,
Hutchinson knew, as he watched the dye slowly fill the uterus and
edge into the tubes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Next week: Where is justice to be found in this confounding case,
the judge wondered.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press correspondent Garry Mitchell in Mobile
contributed to this report.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE STORY SO FAR</TE>
<TE>   When Victoria Banks said she was pregnant, the jail doctor thought
the retarded woman was faking. After all, she'd had her tubes tied
years before. But when a second doctor detected a fetal heartbeat,
Banks was released to have her baby. Months later, she had neither a
swollen stomach nor a baby. The sheriff of Butler, Ala., suspected
murder, but a search turned up no physical evidence of a killing, or
even of a birth. Banks and two of her relatives, both also retarded,
told investigators wildly conflicting stories. In some accounts,
Banks was never pregnant; in others, she miscarried; in others, the
baby was murdered, although the killer's name shifted with each
telling. It fell to District Atty. Bobby Keahey to make sense of all
this. He had no doubt about what to do.</TE>

<HD>Searching Tribal Folklore for a Mythical Quake</HD>
<DH>Nature: Indian tales may link deaths of Northwest coastal
trees with an ocean temblor and a 1700 Japanese tsunami.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MURTAUGH</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>When scientists figured out that sea water drowned groves of tall
trees up and down the coast of Washington state the same year a
tsunami hit Japan, they theorized that a massive earthquake in the
Pacific most likely triggered both events.</LD>
<LD>   Based on Japanese records, scientists were able to pinpoint a
date--Jan. 26, 1700--and estimate that the rupture of a long stretch
of sea floor had caused a magnitude 9 quake, which would be the
largest known temblor ever to strike what is now the contiguous
United States.</LD>
<LD>   But Ruth Ludwin, a University of Washington geophysics professor,
wanted more. There appeared to be no accounts of cataclysmic
earth-shaking in the stories and legends of the only North Americans
who would have been here to witness the quake: Indians.</LD>
<TE>   "When you talk about a very large earthquake in 1700, for that to
be really convincing to me, I really need to have evidence from
people who were there," Ludwin said. "I was looking for a more
comprehensive story."</TE>
<TE>   Ludwin began to search obscure volumes of tribal folklore, where
she found that, for centuries, Indians from British Columbia's
Vancouver Island to the coast of Northern California had been telling
strikingly similar tales of mudslides, of plains that suddenly became
oceans and other stories strongly suggesting that tribes bore witness
to tsunamis like the one in 1700.</TE>
<TE>   Many legends involve a mythic battle between a thunderbird and a
whale.</TE>
<TE>   One tale told by generations of Hoh Indians from the Forks area of
Washington's Olympic Peninsula contains what Ludwin considers the
clearest description of a concurrent earthquake and tsunami yet
discovered in tribal legend.</TE>
<TE>   As the story goes, "There was a great storm and hail and flashes
of lightning in the darkened, blackened sky and a great and crashing
'thunder-noise' everywhere.... There [was] also a great shaking,
jumping and trembling of the earth beneath and a rolling up of the
great waters."</TE>
<TE>   The Makah Indians, whose reservation at Neah Bay sits at the
northwest tip of Washington state, also have a version--one that ends
with a thunderbird delivering a whale inland to the mouth of a river,
giving the giant beast to a tribe that had been starving one winter
thousands of years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Although it's unclear exactly how long the story has been told, it
formed the basis of the tribe's centuries-old whale hunt and could be
linked to one of the seven "megathrust" quakes scientists believe
have occurred over the last 3,500 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's really interesting that our cultural knowledge can
help unravel some of these scientific mysteries," said Janine
Bowechop, director of the Makah Museum. "I feel good that we can
share information and then really have a better understanding for
both worlds."</TE>
<TE>   Many legends contain no time elements. Others that were never
written down have been lost, so Ludwin's work can seem like trying to
solve a puzzle with most of the pieces missing. But she says it's
worth it.</TE>
<TE>   The megathrust quake believed to have occurred in 1700 ruptured
the Cascadia subduction zone, where two of the tectonic plates that
form the Earth's crust--the Juan de Fuca and the North America
plates--overlap. From its northern end, off the western coast of
Vancouver Island, the subduction zone stretches about 600 miles south
to Cape Mendocino in Northern California, then runs into the San
Andreas fault.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Japanese who first theorized that a huge earthquake in
the Pacific caused what they called their "orphan tsunami," so named
because there was no local temblor that accompanied the torrent of
6-foot-high waves that crashed along 500 miles of coastline.</TE>
<TE>   When they learned that groves of red cedars and Sitka spruces
along Washington's coast had dropped several feet, drowning in
saltwater sometime in the late 1600s or early 1700s, they theorized
that one huge quake must have been responsible for both the Japanese
tsunami and this state's "ghost forests."</TE>
<TE>   Radiocarbon dating of spruce stumps narrowed the timeline of the
tree drownings to somewhere between 1680 and 1720, said Brian
Atwater, a U.S. Geological Survey scientist in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   That was too big of a window, so scientists went back to one of
the estuaries where roots of red cedars had survived and could be
dated by the rings in the roots.</TE>
<TE>   At that grove, near the Copalis River in Grays Harbor County,
tree-ring dating showed the red cedars died sometime between August
1699 and May 1700.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had found that those red cedars died in 1697 or 1703, we
would say, 'Well, we're not sure your tsunami came from our
earthquake,' " Atwater said.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew there was an earthquake or a series of earthquakes. The
question was how big and exactly when."</TE>

<HD>Breakdown on the Tollways</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's experience with toll roads offers a lesson learned
the hard way about the cost of infrastructure needed to support
growth. When things went awry in the late 1990s, Orange County was
the focal point. It has five of seven roads created by the
Legislature, and it provided a laboratory for two models.</LD>
<LD>   Both systems, one a single patch of road relying on entirely
private investment and the other a network of toll roads overseen by
a quasi-public agency, ran into big economic and political trouble.
Financial woes and an ill-considered restriction on improvements on
the public right of way led to the unraveling of the 91 Express Lanes
experiment on the Riverside Freeway. Environmental controversy and
overly ambitious ridership projections came home to roost on the San
Joaquin Hills tollway, one of three corridors in the local toll
authority's empire.</LD>
<TE>   The two kinds of toll road experiment in Orange County essentially
arose from two big California ideas. The first was the vision of this
as a state where a huge system of public roads, water projects and
universities sustained a particular kind of lifestyle, and then what
happens when it is no longer possible to rely on public money to
finance expanding those things. The other notion, fueled by Orange
County's distinctive political ideology, was that by the 1980s, big
government had run out of ideas and resources, and that private
investment and initiative were necessary to provide public benefits.</TE>
<TE>   When Orange County legislators lobbied in the 1980s for
Sacramento's blessing on the toll roads idea, the mission was to open
lands to development. The public coffers couldn't pay for new public
roads, so the private idea gained currency as an alternative. Now the
lesson is clear. If you want growth in the future, you need to figure
out how to pay for it in a way that pencils out. Federal and state
gas taxes weren't enough to do the job, and now we see that
projections on ridership have to be backed with financial
performance. It should have been obvious.</TE>
<TE>   There have been other problems. After construction did not begin
on time, a franchise agreement was terminated on an Orange Freeway
extension that was to be a tollway. Noncompetition clauses
interfering with lane additions on the Riverside Freeway caused such
political problems that they soured legislative support for the toll
road concept.</TE>
<TE>   Yet with all this, the notion of private financing of road
construction for needed highways that in time would revert to public
ownership was a plausible idea. The problem, as we have seen in
Orange County, has been in making realistic promises and in executing
a plan well enough to sustain political support. Roads always are
needed for growth, and now Orange County's experiment has
demonstrated how much more care really is needed in executing an
arterial plan paid for at the toll basket.</TE>

<HD>Funding Schools? It's Easy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The equation is simple enough for any pre-algebra student: A rocky
economy equals a state budget shortfall equals tough times for
public-school budgets. Two months before most students start classes,
school districts in Orange County are raiding reserves, putting off
computer upgrades and in some cases even laying off staff to make
ends meet.</LD>
<LD>   But there's a variable that parents and students can manipulate to
their schools' profit or loss. It's as simple as getting the kids to
school.</LD>
<LD>   The way funding for most districts works is that the schools get
state money based on the average number of students attending each
day up to April 15 of the previous school year.</LD>
<TE>   If the students who are enrolled don't make it to class on a given
day, whether the reason is a raging fever or a trip to Raging Waters,
the schools lose money, more than $30 a day per pupil, when the state
figures out a district's funding for the next school year.</TE>
<TE>   So what's the big deal in $30? The Saddleback Valley Unified
School District recently estimated that it lost more than $6 million
in one year because of student absences, excused or otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   We're not talking about the chronic truants who miss 30 days in a
school year. This is the occasional parent-sponsored truancy that
many families practice. A weekday trip to Disneyland ("It's so much
less crowded on a schoolday.") An early start on a holiday weekend,
which means the kids miss Friday classes.</TE>
<TE>   Even the excused absences--a 10 a.m. visit to the dentist's office
and a thought that it isn't worth bringing the child to class for
just a couple of hours--could be converted into money for the schools
by having students start out the day on campus, or come in afterward.
Schools could run attendance contests, with rewards given after April
15 for those with the best records. It would bring in more money than
magazine sales or jogathons, and expose students to more learning.</TE>
<TE>   No one is suggesting that an ill child attend class. But consider
this: A campaign this year to rescue the Irvine public schools from
massive layoffs and bigger class sizes recommended that parents
donate $100 for each child in the school district.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine that parents adjusted family outings and doctor visits to
get students in for roll call three more days of the year. That would
amount to a de facto bailout of about $100 a child, without even
reaching for a wallet. In a district such as Capistrano Unified, with
46,000-plus students, that would have added up to more than $4.5
million for the coming school year, enough to keep the district from
pulling $3.8 million from its reserves, as planned, to cover the
budget shortfall and have money left over.</TE>
<TE>   This is math a parent can love.</TE>

<HD>SigAlert for Social Services</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The freeway traffic jam analogy that Orange County officials are
using to illustrate budget cuts on the horizon in the Social Services
Agency is painful but accurate. Traffic jams quickly spread the pain
to motorists beyond the immediate bottleneck as traffic on nearby
surface streets is disrupted and distant motorists start plotting
alternate routes. Similarly, the pain of a $39-million budget cut at
the agency will move beyond thousands of residents who already depend
upon the county agency for welfare-to-work training, adoptions, day
care and other assistance.</LD>
<LD>   A decision to save money by consolidating means fewer employees
stationed at hospitals and similar centers. In addition to making
services harder to get, fewer workers will be available to initiate
paperwork to recoup funding from the state and federal governments
for some mandated services.</LD>
<LD>   State funding shortfalls are the main culprit in this budgetary
SigAlert. A stalled economy has left the state with a $23.6-billion
deficit; slowing retail sales also have led to a $10-million drop in
sales tax receipts that fund public protection, including the
Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<TE>   One measure of the budget crunch is that, for the first time since
the county's historic bankruptcy in 1994, the county will tap its
reserves to offset an anticipated $57-million shortfall in the
county's $4.3-billion budget.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento is using a time-honored tactic to deal with the
deficit. It's cutting funds for state-mandated programs and pushing
the fiscal pain to the county level. Larry Leaman, county Social
Services Agency director, says it's too early to say which of the
agency's tens of thousands of clients will be hurt most. But it's
likely that this year's cost-cutting will be followed by more in
coming years. And, given the nature of the Social Services Agency,
cuts will fall on residents who most need help.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the potential cuts are decidedly counterproductive.
CalWORKS, a program designed to help people get off welfare, is one
of those particularly frustrating examples. More than 5,000 clients
could be affected by budget cuts. CalWORKS should be at work during a
slow economy when it's harder for people to make the jump from
welfare to work. A program that targets at-risk children also faces
cuts, as do services that steer low-income and unemployed people into
food stamp programs.</TE>
<TE>   Those getting services won't be the only ones affected. Staffing
cuts likely will create a logjam that slows delivery of needed
services to those already registered. In the traffic jam analogy,
it's akin to all of the traffic being funneled into one slow-moving
lane.</TE>
<TE>   The county's $57-million budget shortfall doesn't create the kind
of headlines evident in Los Angeles County, where public health care
is on the verge of a meltdown and the sheriff has released 1,200
nonviolent prisoners from overcrowded jails. But the pain in Orange
County will be just as real for children who will wait longer in
foster care before being adopted and for families living at the
poverty level who will wait longer for food stamps.</TE>
<TE>   The county can't be expected to deliver services without revenue
promised by other levels of government. Sacramento obviously is
feeling pressure from the slowing economy, but it must find a way to
keep promises to fund mandated programs in Orange County.</TE>

<HD>No Business as Usual With Merrill Lynch</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Go Slow on Merrill Lynch Ties," Editorial, July 7:</LD>
<LD>   It was my dear friend Steve de Graaf who drove from Los Angeles
County immediately after I lost the election to former Orange County
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron and gave me this advice: "Be
better, not bitter."</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County bankruptcy occurred as the result of a large
group of well-meaning people that failed to see the red flags because
their eyes were closed. Many have moved on to such jobs as executive
director of the Orange County Business Council and the head of the
Peace Corps. Many have left the firms whose reputations were soiled
by their acts of duplicity.</LD>
<TE>   After seven-plus years, many of us have moved on and exercised
grace and forgiveness. Both are very difficult to do. Holding a
grudge is the easy road to take. I am guilty of it on a regular
basis. But the better side of our conscience tells us we would be
healthier in a relationship if we forgive those who have trespassed
against us.</TE>
<TE>   The mention of Merrill Lynch still makes me bristle. After all, it
was the "County of Orange and John M.W. Moorlach vs. Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co."</TE>
<TE>   The Times insists on a "go slow" approach with restoring "business
as usual." Believe me, it won't be business as usual. My department
selects low-risk investment products while they are available every
morning from broker/dealers. We won't have advisors or another
Michael Stamenson when buying products from Merrill Lynch. If its
product is competitive and fits, we push the button and we've
acquired it. Not using Merrill Lynch loses the taxpayers of this
county money in missed opportunity costs.</TE>
<TE>   It's time to move on. Most of us have. We're smarter and more
mature now. It's time to "be better, not bitter."</TE>

<LD>Re "Tollway Trial at a Dead End in California," July 7:</LD>
<LD>   Thank goodness we are finally starting to see some sanity in south
Orange County. I have lived in San Clemente since 1972, and it pains
me to see the growth we are experiencing. I cannot hold the people
who move to my beautiful city in ill opinion, as everyone I know and
meet loves this place. But when I drive over the hills and look at
Talega, I see ugly urban sprawl where there once was beautiful land.</LD>
<LD>   It seems that growth is, to a certain point, inevitable. But we do
not need to completely ravage the beautiful San Mateo Valley. These
areas are quickly disappearing in Southern California, and we are
extremely fortunate that this experiment was a failure. Once these
areas are ruined, they will remain so. We need to protect them.</LD>

<TE>   Turnpikes in the eastern United States are widely accepted because
the tolls are fair and equitable, based on the distance that the
motorist travels. That is not the case with the toll roads in Orange
County.</TE>
<TE>   For example, on the San Joaquin Hills tollway, a northbound
motorist entering at Laguna Canyon and exiting at the next exit,
Newport Coast Drive, pays the same toll as the motorist who drives
the entire length of the toll road simply because the main toll plaza
is between the Laguna Canyon and Newport Coast exits. That is neither
fair nor equitable. I would submit it is the principal reason for the
dramatic drop in traffic volume on the weekends and during off-peak
hours.</TE>
<TE>   The solution is not to continue to increase tolls; the solution is
a fair and equitable pricing structure based on the distance a
motorist travels.</TE>

<TE>   I never did like the idea of having to pay more and more for the
use of the toll road. Maybe that's because so few people use them.
Plus, on the Riverside Freeway we could use the room for a carpool
lane. I heard they wanted to build more of these toll roads, charge
us more and also destroy part of the beach. Let's see, charge us more
and more, take up needed freeway space, destroy the beach. I'm glad
they're having trouble.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was great to see The Times' July 7 coverage of the toll roads
debacle. The noncompete agreements are a particular outrage, but the
whole idea of privately built roads is problematic. They were not
built for the greatest convenience of the public, but to optimize
profits (at least that was the theory, which didn't work out too
well). Some of these roads have been stuffed down the unwilling
throats of the local communities. The sooner these become public
property, the better. Unlike some, I would much rather pay taxes to
create and maintain roads built by and for the public than provide
profits for a self-serving company that has no interest except in the
bottom line.</TE>

<HD>How Has the Sewage Waiver Lasted So Long?</HD>

<LD>Re "Runoff Is Far Greater Threat to Coast Than Sewage Plume,"
Commentary, July 7:</LD>
<LD>   Yes, runoff is a far larger problem than the sewage waiver under
which the Orange County Sanitation District operates. However,
stopping urban runoff will require a fundamental change in the way we
live, work, build cities, etc.</LD>
<LD>   I submit that these changes--akin to the "growing pains" of an
entire civilization--will not be easy.</LD>
<TE>   But the waiver, now there's something that no one else is doing,
at least at this level, and it is something major we can do right now
to battle ocean pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Why it ever got this far is beyond the good people of Southern
California, and I do believe it will soon be a thing of the past.</TE>
<TE>   I say that with confidence, having experienced the incredible
protest scene at the last sewage district meeting in Fountain Valley,
where hundreds of members of the public (more than 100 speakers)
voiced opposition and concern about the waiver, and none spoke in
favor.</TE>

<TE>   UCI scientist and researcher Stanley Grant said that "coastal
pollution is a maddeningly trans-disciplinary problem, equal parts
microbiology, ecology, physical oceanography, environmental
engineering and political science."</TE>
<TE>   I find it peculiar that someone who uses science and facts as the
foundation for his life work would write an article that puts a
political slant on the issue. Cost-benefit analysis of full secondary
treatment is a more complicated issue that his somewhat superficial
treatment of the facts. Disinfection of the sewage has been discussed
by the Orange County Sanitation District only as a temporary
solution. It is a separate issue from the treatment-level options now
under consideration.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Grant's research was funded by the sanitation district.
One may wonder about his motivation in sending this article to your
paper one week before the cities vote on the next treatment level for
the sewage outfall.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Hardeman</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As Grant states in his commentary Sunday about runoff and ocean
quality: "We are creating a whole new research field, call it coastal
water quality science, that will be a critical player in the years to
come." The pot of money that the sanitation district has in reserve
seems to have been targeted by those who would like to create a new
industry.</TE>
<TE>   The conundrum of whether the plume reaches the shore is really a
red herring. Reuse of 240 million gallons of water a day should be
the focus. Ridding ourselves of the waiver could be the first step in
moving toward this goal. Grant seems to have given up his hypothesis
that the influx and reflux of 300 million gallons of water (soon to
be 500) a day could be drawing the plume to shore--a hypothesis that
has not even been tested, let alone proved invalid.</TE>
<TE>   The AES plant was operating only for three days of the study done
last summer, hardly a comprehensive picture of the situation. To
discard the theory without a fair test is unscientific, and the
timing of the article with the vote on the waiver being later this
month is highly suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Don McGee</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grant implies that the rancor surrounding the sanitation district
is only about full secondary treatment. The issue brought before the
district and city councils throughout the service area has always
been about the continued use by the district of the 301(h) waiver to
avoid fully meeting the standards set forth in the Clean Water Act.</TE>
<TE>   If the district applies for a permit without using the waiver, it
will still have options and can use various combinations of treatment
available now and in the future to meet the Clean Water Act
standards.</TE>
<TE>   I agree with Grant that runoff is a major contributor to overall
deterioration of the water quality in the ocean. This doesn't mean we
should ignore a known large source of contaminants such as the
outfall. It also doesn't mean we should allow the district to
continue using the waiver to do business as usual. Up until February
of this year, the district was telling everyone that all was safe,
healthy and no problem, until the "plume came too close for comfort"
off Newport Beach. Suddenly disinfection was needed to protect the
beaches.</TE>
<TE>   At the July 17 district board meeting, the directors should get
rid of the waiver as part of the next permit request. The method of
treatment can then be determined within the parameters of the federal
Clean Water Act and limits and requirements of the state laws
governing water quality. Millions of dollars have already been taken
from treatment to try to show that the plume didn't close the beaches
in '99. Taking more money from the treatment of the sewage to fund
more investigation is foolish. Funding for "coastal water quality
science" should be made available, but not by robbing Peter to pay
Paul. Grant should look elsewhere for his funding.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The debate over the cause of local beach pollution has been raging
since the summer of 1999. Is it the sanitation district's waste-water
discharge, urban runoff or suspect municipal sewer systems that are
responsible for local beach postings and closures? It's probably a
combination of all three, each pollution source bearing a different
degree of responsibility. Therefore, it was disappointing to read
Grant's editorial position, limiting beach contamination emphasis to
urban runoff.</TE>
<TE>   Grant did state that "full secondary treatment would reduce the
levels of organic contaminants, viruses and bacteria released to the
ocean" by the sanitation district. He than took issue with the cost
of enjoying such a benefit.</TE>
<TE>   According to a recent letter by Lisa Murphy, communications
director for the sanitation district, "On the average over 15 years,
residents will see an increase of $16 per year per household," in
some years reaching $36 a year. Which means that for $1.33 per month,
ratepayers will begin the process of reducing the bacteria burden of
the district's wastewater. I'm sorry, Dr. Grant, but I prefer to pay
the price.</TE>
<TE>   Lastly, the district board of directors is scheduled to vote on
whether to transition to a new level of waste-water treatment on July
17. It's interesting that Grant elected to submit his editorial just
10 days before the next board meeting. He's had three years to change
his mind.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Nelson</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Regarding Grant's article, I would like to point out the
following:</TE>
<TE>   1. The O.C. Sanitation District has been avoiding full compliance
with the intent of the federal Clean Water Act for 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   2. The district is by far the largest municipal polluter in the
U.S., measured by pounds of suspended (fecal) solids discharged per
day.</TE>
<TE>   3. The district's ocean discharge has created a sewage plume that
measures at least six miles long by four miles wide by 100 feet
thick.</TE>
<TE>   4. Using estimates on the district's Web site, the difference in
solids discharged to the ocean between its current permit limits and
full secondary treatment amounts to 157 million pounds per year.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe all this is "secondary" to Grant, but stopping the ocean
discharge of 157 million pounds of fecal solids per year at a cost of
up to 10 cents per day per household sounds like a bargain to me and
a worthwhile step in the improvement of health of the ocean
environment.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Latino Group Bridges the Barriers of Autism," July 8:</LD>
<LD>   Jose Hernandez is quoted as saying, "But the only answers they
give you are in English." The story goes on to say that the
Hernandezes "had to do their own research." I don't understand the
Hernandezes' point, or yours. Is there some reason that they should
be given information in another language? Why did Gloria Hernandez
have to go to Mexico City to research autism, since you said in your
article that they speak English? Even if they didn't, do you really
believe she had to quit her job and go to Mexico City to find
information about autism?</LD>
<LD>   My sister-in-law is from Japan, yet she doesn't assume that she
will be given information in Japanese. My brother-in-law is
Portuguese; again, he doesn't expect to find information in anything
but English. And I have friends from Colombia; they can't believe
that people who speak Spanish deserve to be treated any differently
from any other immigrant. Why do you?</LD>
<TE>   Lynn E. Powers</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I applaud the Hernandez parents for creating a much-needed support
group for Latino families of autistic children. But I am a one-on-one
special education aide in a school district, and my applause stopped
at the revelation that the Hernandezes and Grupo Angeles teach
parents how to demand "their rights" from school districts.</TE>
<TE>   Making school districts pay for programs for special-needs
children, such as one-on-one aides, special services and equipment,
is not going to have the long-range effect that all parents want: for
their child to function normally. Putting an autistic child in a
regular classroom will never transform that child into being just
like the other kids in the class.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the long-range effects of the demands on the schools from
those parents of special-needs children are that other children lose
out. Children who don't qualify as "special needs" students but who
could truly be helped to progress and succeed in such basic skills as
reading or math do not get the money needed because the districts are
stretched to meet the demands of the ever-increasing
special-education population.</TE>
<TE>   Why can't Johnny read? Because aides spend five and six hours each
day with special-needs kids who sit in a regular classroom even
though they cannot do the work, and who may learn to read the words
or to add two plus two, but who will never comprehend what they've
read or put their math skills to use.</TE>
<TE>   Congratulations to the Hernandezes and other parents like them and
their group for helping to further drain an already grossly
over-stretched school system. Taxpayers should know the real truth
about where the money is spent in their local schools, and why their
kids do not get a good basic education anymore.</TE>

<LD>Re "Latest in Anaheim Is Also What's Oldest," July 1:</LD>
<LD>   Thank you for your outstanding article about the Anaheim Historic
Colony and Anaheim's efforts to preserve historic homes with the
creation of a historic district and a preservation plan.</LD>
<LD>   It's great to learn the residents are beginning to reap the
benefits of their hard work and the work of the Anaheim City Council
and staff.</LD>
<TE>   The increase in property values and the demand for historic homes
is a clear indication of the success of Anaheim's program.</TE>
<TE>   We are struggling with many of the same historical issues in Yorba
Linda, where a historic district and Mills Act tax exemptions could
benefit historic-home owners in the Park Place neighborhood, adjacent
to the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace.</TE>
<TE>   The Park Place neighborhood is similar in area to the Anaheim
colony and is close to a historic commercial district with the same
potential.</TE>
<TE>   It's time for Yorba Linda to follow the lead of Anaheim, Orange
and Fullerton, which have adopted historic preservation plans that
benefit not only the residents but also the community.</TE>

<LD>Re "State Budget Is Test for O.C. Legislators," Orange County
Commentary, July 7:</LD>
<LD>   In discussing Orange County legislators and the state budget,
Steven B. Frates writes: "The question is whether any member of the
Orange County delegation has the requisite political skill and
leadership ability."</LD>
<LD>   Is Frates suggesting that the Orange County delegation will be
pressured into voting for something that is not right because of the
urgings of more political skillful members of the Legislature?</LD>
<TE>   Nonsense. They can vote on the budget, can't they? And they can
vote for what is right, not "politically" expedient, can't they?</TE>
<TE>   When I run out of money I stop spending and using credit cards.
Unfortunately, our Legislature, as embodied by Senate Majority Leader
John Burton (D-San Francisco), doesn't seem to have grasped that
concept. More taxes is always their answer. With their perks they
don't have to worry about taxes.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I have lived in Irvine for more than 20 years. I have raised my
family here; I have made my living here; my wife and I are growing
old together here.</LD>
<LD>   I strongly believe that what makes Irvine special is the working
relationship between the city of Irvine and the Irvine Co.--sometimes
antagonistic, sometimes cooperative, but always creative--that has
resulted in the planning and development of America's finest
master-planned community. Sure, some people complain about the
"sameness" and the fact that there's no central downtown, but most
residents are happy, secure and tickled pink with their property
values.</LD>
<LD>   With the horrible plan for the international airport now dead, I
am very comfortable with the concept for the so-called Northern
Sphere. It means open space instead of tarmac space, new schools
instead of new hangars, and new homes instead of new flight paths.</LD>
<TE>   Irvine was recently named one of the safest cities in the nation
and is one of the most visited--and emulated--master-planned
communities in the world. As a longtime Irvine resident, I feel lucky
to be living here.</TE>

<LD>   Knowing that UC Irvine helps shelter the tender psyches of Hugh
Roberts and Richard Kroll from the beigeness of greater Irvine, not
to mention the Camaro-driving petite bourgeoisie of Aliso Viejo,
makes it so much easier for me to sleep nights. As for the "garret"
life of faculty in major urban areas, the most inspiring,
thought-provoking--alive!--mentors I encountered in graduate school
were those deliberately living--indeed reveling, immersed up to their
eyeballs--in the gritty, messy, vibrant urban milieu of the
surrounding city. But then, I suppose Fortress UCI must be seeking a
different species of mentor.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Garden Grove Chooses Wisely," Editorial, July 7:</LD>
<LD>   My heart was lightened by the fact that homeowners in Garden Grove
were able to make a difference. Turf wars are getting bloodier in
Orange County as land becomes scarce. These battles take constant
vigilance and participation by residents.</LD>
<LD>   Garden Grove rezoning is an issue that is not so far removed from
the issues of cities surrounding El Toro that had to fight for
representation against an international airport.</LD>
<TE>   Garden Grove may not have given full support to those cities in
the countywide elections but perhaps now realizes and will be more
sensitive to those that have uphill battles against local government
imposing on their homes.</TE>
<TE>   A wonderful show of unity by Garden Grove and the other county
cities named on the lawsuit to overturn Measure W would be to
withdraw their name.</TE>
<TE>   The residents of these cities would have to stand up to their
councils and say we accept Measure W as voted upon by Orange County
voters and insist that they remove their city's support for the

<LD>Re "When a Few Tar the Innocent Many," July 6:</LD>
<LD>   Muzammil Siddiqi of the Islamic Center of Orange County seems
upset that the majority of Americans view the murders at LAX as a
terrorist act because of the ethnic background of the murderer.</LD>
<LD>   "People don't say he was a crazy person," he complains. "They say
he was a Muslim or Arab terrorist."</LD>
<TE>   No, not really. Americans say he was a crazy Muslim person, just
as Americans say the murderers of abortionists are crazy Christian
zealots. Such definitions are not "racist," just a reflection of the
multicultural mores of 21st century America.</TE>
<TE>   Hussam Ayloush of the Council of American-Islamic Relations in
Anaheim says "the definition [of terrorism] has changed, based on
who's doing it. This is outrageous and racist."</TE>
<TE>   No, Hussam, not at all. It is simply a reasonable assumption and
conclusion arrived at by a people concerned about the survival of
their country, their families and themselves.</TE>

<LD>Re "So He Was an Arab--Let's Not Overreact," column, July 7:</LD>
<LD>   I applaud Dana Parsons for his thoughtful and reasonable words in
the column, and I commend The Times for publishing it.</LD>
<LD>   Our nation is understandably tense and on edge, and that makes it
all the more important not to jump to conclusions or vilify a whole
group of people.</LD>
<TE>   As Parsons writes, the individual who opened fire in the airport
is exactly that: an individual. We should not, as some Americans and
Israelis have, assume he is a terrorist or a member of some larger,
hostile group.</TE>
<TE>   There are millions of peaceful Arabs, Egyptians and Muslims living
in the United States, and it would be folly to turn on them in
suspicion and hate because of the actions of one. I hope we Americans
can exemplify our nation's ideals by standing up for tolerance,
justice and appreciation of diversity.</TE>

<HD>Strangers Say Goodbye to Abandoned Infants</HD>
<DH>Burial: Fifty people gather for a funeral service for three
babies whose bodies were recently found in the Los Angeles area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A crowd of 50 people, mostly strangers, cried, prayed, listened to
poems and became a family for the three abandoned babies buried
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The bodies of Amanda, Angelita and Paloma--names given to them by
those attending the service--had been discovered in the Los Angeles
area in the last four weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "There were more people here to show these babies love than their
parents ever did," said Gilda Tolbert, an investigator for the Los
Angeles County Coroner's Office who attended the ceremony.</LD>
<TE>   Amanda's body was found June 10 at a recycling plant in the City
of Industry.</TE>
<TE>   Angelita and Paloma, twins, were found in a garbage bin.
Authorities did not release any other details about the twins.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of the ceremony, Sgt. Richard Longshore of the
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department carried a tiny 10-pound
casket with Amanda's body inside.</TE>
<TE>   Longshore is one of the investigators who was called to the scene
when Amanda's body was found on the recycling plant's conveyor belt.</TE>
<TE>   Longshore said he had named the baby Amanda because he had heard
the name means "deserved to be loved."</TE>
<TE>   Husband and wife Doyle and Gilda Tolbert carried the second
miniature casket with Angelita and Paloma.</TE>
<TE>   The Tolberts, who are investigating the twins' deaths, named one
Angelita, because it means "little angel" in Spanish. They named the
other Paloma, which means "dove."</TE>
<TE>   "They never had a chance," Gilda Tolbert said.</TE>
<TE>   "Who should they trust in this world? Their mother. But they were
just tossed out and thrown away."</TE>
<TE>   In her 25 years with the County Coroner's office, Gilda Tolbert
said, she has worked on many cases involving abandoned babies, all
equally upsetting.</TE>
<TE>   Debi Faris, 46, who lives in Yucaipa, near Calimesa in Riverside
County, where the funeral was held, has recovered and buried the
bodies of 52 children from Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside
counties since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   She started the work because she felt it was her duty. Faris runs
the Garden of Angels organization, a nonprofit group that buries
abandoned babies.</TE>
<TE>   She also works to educate young women about options that are
available to them if they unintentionally become pregnant and decide
they do not want to raise the child.</TE>
<TE>   "Who could throw away an innocent little child who never asked to
be here on this earth?" Faris asked.</TE>
<TE>   California's "safe haven" law allows women to leave their children
at a hospital emergency room within 72 hours of birth with no
questions asked and no fear of prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   But many women are not aware of the law, Faris said.</TE>
<TE>   There should be more media and educational campaigns to prevent
mothers from abandoning their children and allowing them to die, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Headstones, burial costs and flowers are paid for by private
contributors and the Garden of Angels' foundation, which is funded
with donations and grants.</TE>
<TE>   The bodies of the three babies were buried alongside nearly 50
others in the Garden of Angels graveyard.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, headstones were engraved with names like "Reggie, the
humble one" who was buried March 3, 2000, and "Angeline, the
messenger," who was buried July 22, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-one doves were released at the end of the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "These babies here got my heart," said Don Smiley, 70, who
frequently attends funerals for discarded babies.</TE>
<TE>   Smiley wrote a poem for Angelita, which included this passage: "We
see you as you might have been, the little doll you might have held.
A toss of hair, infectious grin, would have caused our hearts to
melt."</TE>

<AU>STEVE BERRY and HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With half a dozen investigations underway into the Inglewood police
beating, prosecutors now confront constitutional and practical
difficulties, which they must overcome even as they face pressure to
act quickly.</LD>
<LD>   Among other things, they must decide which agencies will take the
lead and which officers, if any, to pursue most vigorously on
possible state or federal charges ranging from assault to civil
rights violations.</LD>
<LD>   One potential conflict was defused Friday when Los Angeles County
Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley took primary responsibility for the
investigation, which was ceded by U.S. Department of Justice
officials.</LD>
<TE>   And Cooley's office acted with uncharacteristic aggressiveness,
taking the case to a grand jury less than a day after the videotape
of the police beating of a black youth in Inglewood came to light.
That step may have long-term ramifications for the investigation, as
it means witnesses already are being forced to tell their versions of
the event under oath. A decade ago, federal prosecutors used the
grand jury to great advantage in the prosecution of the officers who
beat Rodney G. King, and now local officials are proceeding down a
similar path.</TE>
<TE>   The knotty legal problems grow out of the fact that--in this case,
as with the King prosecution--there are multiple investigations. In
the Inglewood incident, the inquiries include those by the U.S.
Department of Justice with the FBI, and internal disciplinary
inquiries and criminal investigations by the Inglewood Police
Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   "The King case is the predicate for everything," said Ira Reiner,
who was the district attorney then. That case and the beating of the
handcuffed 16-year-old Donovan Jackson by Inglewood police a week ago
are vastly different, Reiner said.</TE>
<TE>   But "everything is measured against King and everything is seen in
[its] context," Reiner said.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Cooley agreed that the King case--which Los
Angeles prosecutors lost in state court, triggering the 1992
riots--offers important lessons about prosecuting police misconduct.
The federal government later indicted the same officers, and
convicted two of them of civil rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think we drew more lessons from Rampart than we did from
the King case," Cooley said, referring to the two-year police
misconduct scandal that erupted in September 1999 and brought the
dismissals or resignations of more than a dozen officers.</TE>
<TE>   He said Rampart showed the need for "prosecutorial oversight" of
any investigation of police misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   He said the scandal made it clear that prosecutors must get
involved early in any investigation of police wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, grand juries were not involved until police had
completed their own probe, or were well into it. But in the Inglewood
case, prosecutors decided to use its investigative and subpoena
powers immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we've ever moved this quickly," Cooley said Friday,
saying the public won't be subjected to "months of angst and
speculation."</TE>
<TE>   Merrick Bobb, the Board of Supervisors' special counsel on law
enforcement matters, said using the grand jury speeds up the
investigation. In the Inglewood case, street protests, the repeated
broadcast of the videotape and intense media coverage nationwide put
pressure on authorities to act quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "The lesson from King is if you don't defuse it early, it can get
worse," said Laurie Levenson, a Loyola University law professor.</TE>
<TE>   Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst and senior scholar at
USC, said Cooley's swift action is intended to preclude "debate over
whether he is dragging his heels when a black guy had an altercation
with a white policeman."</TE>
<TE>   Some, including protesters who took to the streets in Inglewood on
Friday, aren't satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   Gigi Gordon, a prominent Los Angeles defense lawyer, made a
similar point.</TE>
<TE>   "The community is asking why isn't this guy arrested," she said.
"When a crime occurs and it's witnessed ... the guy is arrested and
the details are sorted out later, except when you are a cop, then the
details are sorted out first," Gordon said.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury, composed of private citizens, often lends
credibility to an investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the grand jury can put witnesses under oath and force
them to answer questions now, before more evidence becomes public.</TE>
<TE>   That means that the accounts of police officers in particular are
fixed early in the investigation. In contrast, some police witnesses
in the King case softened their accounts between the police
investigation and the first criminal trial in Simi Valley, which
ended in acquittals. That's when federal prosecutors stepped in.</TE>
<TE>   Caroline Witcoff, head of the civil rights unit in the U.S.
attorney's office in Los Angeles, said the fact that witnesses have
already been subpoenaed to the grand jury has persuaded her office to
move cautiously.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to ensure that we do not do anything to interfere with
their investigation," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As the case moves forward, prosecutors face a tough opponent in
John Barnett, the lawyer for Jeremy Morse, the officer seen on the
videotape slamming Jackson into the car and punching him. Barnett,
who secured the acquittal of LAPD Officer Theodore J. Briseno in the
first trial in the King case, is widely respected in the legal
community.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett is known for aggressive, creative courtroom tactics. He
might demand that any statements officers are compelled to give in
disciplinary inquiries be turned over to him on the grounds that they
may contain material helpful to his client. That would provide him
with information denied to prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors must insulate their investigation from the
disciplinary inquiries into the officers' conduct. In those
inquiries, the officers will be required to give statements about the
incident. Constitutional protections against self-incrimination
prohibit prosecutors from later using those statements, or deriving
any investigative benefit from them.</TE>
<TE>   The compelled statements are therefore "radioactive," infecting
any prosecutor who knows of them, said a veteran Los Angeles attorney
who is a former federal prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   Because the federal government may eventually want to prosecute,
local prosecutors must be especially careful in deciding whether to
grant immunity in exchange for cooperation. Any grant of immunity
could tie the hands of federal prosecutors later.</TE>
<TE>   A classic example of that problem occurred in 1990 during the
Iran-Contra scandal when charges against then-White House aide Oliver
North and former National Security Advisor John Poindexter were
thrown out by a federal judge because their prosecutions were deemed
tainted by the use of immunized congressional testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Still, for now, it is the local prosecutors who have the lead
role. As a result, after a week of hectic action, Cooley now stands
at center stage, forced to choose between proceeding with a
politically charged case that could fail or dropping it and
alienating those outraged by the videotape.</TE>
<TE>   The King beating provides a powerful reminder that a videotape
does not guarantee a conviction.</TE>

<LD>William Bratton, whose leadership of the New York Police Department
made him one of the nation's best-known police commanders, has
stepped down from the team monitoring the LAPD because he is
considering entering the race to become Los Angeles' next chief.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview, Bratton said he would make up his mind this week
about whether to apply for the Los Angeles Police Department's top
job, but he already has sounded out some city leaders.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor James K. Hahn is interested in his candidacy, according to
City Hall sources, and some City Council members are expressing
enthusiasm for Bratton even before he has applied.</LD>
<TE>   Bratton, who described the LAPD as a department "in crisis," said
he wanted to consult his family before deciding whether to seek the
job.</TE>
<TE>   At 54, Bratton is married and has one son. They live in New York,
but he has traveled frequently to Los Angeles in recent months in
connection with his role as part of the LAPD monitoring team.</TE>
<TE>   If he got the job, Bratton would become the first person ever to
head the police departments of the nation's two largest cities.</TE>
<TE>   His tenure as NYPD commissioner was marked by historic declines in
homicides and other serious felonies, as well as by complaints from
civil libertarians about the NYPD's stepped-up emphasis on low-level
crimes and by political tensions with then-Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said he was considering the LAPD job because he was
intrigued by the challenge of overhauling the department, which has
confronted allegations of brutality and corruption in recent years
and is under a federal court order that governs many aspects of its
management and operation.</TE>
<TE>   City officials estimate that the Rampart scandal alone--with its
charges of evidence planting, perjury, improper shootings and drug
dealing, among other things--eventually will cost taxpayers $125
million in legal judgments and settlements.</TE>
<TE>   "I think anyone would argue that the LAPD is the most urgent, most
challenging and, most importantly, doable turnaround policing
opportunity in America today," Bratton said.</TE>
<TE>   "I look for organizations in crisis and in need of cultural
change. I'm a professional turnaround man. That's what I do."</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of a Bratton candidacy already has irritated some
members of the LAPD's top brass, who complain that the brash New
Yorker is using his access on the monitoring team to solicit support
for his possible bid. Those concerns helped prompt Bratton's
withdrawal from the team.</TE>
<TE>   Some supporters say Bratton's strong personality is just what the
LAPD needs, and some believe his reputation for cracking down on
low-level crimes would appeal to conservatives, including those who
are flirting with the idea of San Fernando Valley secession.</TE>
<TE>   "His reputation precedes him," said Councilman Eric Garcetti.
"He's an A-list candidate. Much of what he did in New York was
pioneer work in policing. A world-class city like Los Angeles would
definitely welcome his candidacy."</TE>
<TE>   As New York City police commissioner from 1994 to 1996, Bratton
gained recognition as New York's crime rate plummeted.</TE>
<TE>   During his two years as head of the NYPD, the number of serious
felonies in New York fell by 33% and the murder rate was cut in half.
Although scholars continue to debate the reasons for that drop, many
credit the NYPD and Bratton with a significant role.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton resigned as New York City police commissioner in April
1996 to take a job as head of the New York City division of
Boston-based First Security Services Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Crime levels in New York had dropped to their lowest level in 30
years at the time, and there was speculation that Giuliani had forced
Bratton out because Bratton was getting credit for the drop. Bratton
insisted that he had left voluntarily.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton--who also served as head of Boston's police department and
as the head of New York's transit police before that agency merged
with the NYPD--helped develop a computerized database of crime
statistics to help officers target hot spots more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   That system, known as COMPSTAT, was at the center of the NYPD's
approach to attacking crime under Bratton. It also captured the
attention of Los Angeles officials, who copied it and now use
something like it at the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Bratton became a nationally recognized policing
leader, and his celebrity helped put him at odds with Giuliani.</TE>
<TE>   After Bratton left New York, the former commissioner went to work
as a consultant, advising police departments on how to fight crime.</TE>
<TE>   As a member of Kroll Associates, Bratton has traveled around the
world meeting with police chiefs and government leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, he was in Lima, Peru, where last year alone there
were more than 12,000 robberies and 800 murders in the central city
area.</TE>
<TE>   Between his foreign jobs, Bratton has worked with the team
monitoring the LAPD's progress in making dozens of reforms outlined
in a federal consent decree.</TE>
<TE>   The city adopted the decree nearly two years ago to avoid a
lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice, which alleged that the
LAPD had engaged in a "pattern or practice" of misconduct and civil
rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   "LAPD was the model of professional policing until the 1990s,"
Bratton said.</TE>
<TE>   "Then it was found that the emperor had no clothes. The department
failed, subsequent to the Rodney King events.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a prize fighter who had difficulty getting up for the
next round."</TE>
<TE>   He said the LAPD's problems closely mirror many of the problems
that faced the NYPD when he took it over.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't want to commit to a department that is perceived to be
in good shape," Bratton said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles began looking for a new police chief in April after
the Police Commission voted to deny then-Chief Bernard Parks' request
for a second five-year term. Parks stepped down several weeks later
and is running for the City Council's 8th District seat.</TE>
<TE>   The city recently hired a consultant to screen applicants and
forward the names of qualified candidates to the Police Commission.
Candidates have until Friday to apply.</TE>
<TE>   Although city officials have not disclosed the names of those who
have applied so far, interest in the job--which pays $168,000 to
$253,000 a year--has been brisk.</TE>
<TE>   Among those already actively seeking the position are Portland,
Ore., Police Chief Mark Kroeker, a former LAPD deputy chief who was a
finalist for the job five years ago; Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez,
also a former LAPD deputy chief; and LAPD Cmdr. George Gascon.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who have expressed interest are LAPD Deputy Chiefs
David Gascon, David Kalish and Margaret York and LAPD Cmdr. Jim
McDonnell.</TE>
<TE>   In the coming weeks, the Police Commission is expected to narrow
the list to the top three candidates. Hahn will then name his choice
for the job, subject to City Council confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn declined to comment Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Commission President Rick Caruso also declined Saturday to discuss
Bratton's possible candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to withhold comment until I see his application and
interview him," Caruso said.</TE>
<TE>   "I encourage everyone who is qualified to apply. The more
qualified the applicants, the better."</TE>

<HD>Firefighters Prepare for Next Big Blaze</HD>
<DH>Alert: Danger season begins early this year, fed by a dry
winter and summer heat. The county's already-busy crews say they are
ready.</DH>

<LD>After battling brush fires in northern Los Angeles County for three
straight days last week, firefighters spent rare down time inspecting
equipment, offering safety tips to property owners and resting.</LD>
<LD>   The next blaze is just a spark away.</LD>
<LD>   "We know that it's not a matter of if, but when we'll get a call,"
said Capt. Norm Branch of the Los Angeles County Fire Department's
Station 111 in Saugus.</LD>
<TE>   Hot temperatures, dry brush and sporadic winds have created
dangerous wildfire conditions, officials said. As a result, Fire
Department resources are being expended far before the traditional
start of the brush fire season in September.</TE>
<TE>   "We are gearing up for a very busy brush fire season," said
Inspector Kurt Schaefer, a county Fire Department spokesman. "A lot
depends on weather conditions, which are obviously out of our
control, so we have to be prepared."</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials predicted this spring that the fire season in much
of Southern California would start earlier than usual because of one
of the driest winters on record.</TE>
<TE>   Fire danger forecasts are based on the amount of moisture in
ground vegetation, officials said. The less moisture, the more
flammable they are.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials encourage property owners to clear brush away from
buildings and to be prepared to heed evacuation orders.</TE>
<TE>   Brush fires on three consecutive days beginning last Monday pushed
firefighters beyond exhaustion as they battled blazes in Santa
Clarita and north of Pyramid Lake. The fires charred nearly 400
acres, heavily damaged one home and threatened hundreds of others,
and temporarily shut down local freeways. There were no serious
injuries, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's fires followed the recent Copper and Bouquet Canyon
blazes. The Copper fire in June blackened 23,500 acres, destroyed
nine homes and came perilously close to dozens more. It was named for
the street near Santa Clarita where a spark from welding equipment
set off the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters in May battled a fire in Bouquet Canyon about eight
miles northeast of Santa Clarita in the Angeles National Forest.
Flames burned 3,200 acres and two outbuildings.</TE>
<TE>   To battle brush fires, firefighters say they eat healthy foods,
drink plenty of water and exercise regularly. The conditioning, they
say, gives them the strength to lug 35 to 40 pounds of equipment and
haul hundreds of feet of heavy hoses up steep hillsides while wearing
protective gear.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are battling the fire, you don't notice how hard you're
working," said county firefighter Scott Tucker of Station 126 in
Valencia. "When it's all over, that's when the fatigue gets to you.
All you want to do is sleep."</TE>
<TE>   Branch said that he saves his strength by slowing down when the
temperature rises above 100 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to do our exercises in the early morning," he said. "Then
we try to stay inside by the air conditioner to keep our body
temperature cool."</TE>
<TE>   As a fire specialist, Mark Kyllingstad of Station 73 in Newhall
said it's his job to look for signs of fatigue among firefighters as
they battle brush fires that produce towering flames, thick smoke and
superheated air.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep my head up and watch to see if it's too hot. If it is, I
back the guys up and we move downhill to a safety zone," he said.
"It's extremely fatiguing."</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters say they also spend a lot of time inspecting
equipment, which at many stations includes a fire engine, a
bulldozer, a water truck, two patrol trucks and hundreds of feet of
hose.</TE>
<TE>   "When we get a 911 call that a hill's on fire, we have to be ready
to move a lot of stuff," Schaefer said.</TE>
<TE>   It's not unusual that during slow periods firefighters are looking
under a fire engine's hood, checking a patrol truck's brake linings
or cleaning, hanging and packing hoses.</TE>
<TE>   Schaefer said the camaraderie among firefighters also helps them
mentally prepare for the fires.</TE>
<TE>   "Firefighters feed off of one another," Schaefer said. "We just
say, 'We got the last one. Let's go get this one.' "</TE>

<HD>A Fading Fleet</HD>
<DH>Newport's Dory Fishermen Face Tough Times and Tighter Rules</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the rustic market where the Newport Beach dory fleet does
business, Stratos Voyatzis frets over a few dozen slick, black
sablefish that his two sons have worked through the night to catch.</LD>
<LD>   "Not enough, not enough," the 72-year-old patriarch says in a
heavy Greek accent. "You can't support three families with this."</LD>
<LD>   His eldest son, Marco, does the arithmetic. Minus expenses for
line, hooks, gas, bait and hired hands, that leaves about $100 per
family assuming all their fish are sold at $3 a pound.</LD>
<TE>   The Voyatzises are not alone. The few families that have worked
for decades out of this historic beachfront site off McFadden Square
are all in the same boat.</TE>
<TE>   A popular tourist attraction and source of fresh seafood since
1891, the last fleet of dory men on the West Coast is going the way
of the family farm and the mom-and-pop grocery.</TE>
<TE>   As late as 1990, 15 to 20 men regularly operated out of the
group's headquarters and fish market on the sand next to Newport
Pier, pushing off early each morning through the surf in their
flat-bottom boats.</TE>
<TE>   Now there are no more than six, and some of the tightest fishing
restrictions in years are threatening to put them, as well as their
unique lifestyle, out of business.</TE>
<TE>   "It's steadily gotten worse and worse," said Jim Baker, 55, of
Costa Mesa, who has been a Newport dory man for 23 years. "It takes
$250 a day just to get out and fish. If I can't cover costs, I've got
to find another job. That day is not too far away."</TE>
<TE>   In an emergency action on June 20, the federal government ordered
a halt to commercial fishing off much of the California coast for
popular varieties of rockfish, commonly sold as red snapper.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials say the action is the beginning of what could
become an indefinite closure of the continental shelf off California,
Oregon and Washington to bottom fishing. Permanent regulations will
be decided in September.</TE>
<TE>   The emergency action follows the latest population estimates
showing that rockfish numbers continue to plunge despite catch limits
and other conservation measures. Of 16 types of rockfish studied so
far, biologists have determined that nine have been grossly
overfished.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the California Department of Fish and Game is
considering resource management plans for near-shore waters shallower
than 120 feet. Public hearings are scheduled throughout the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Under the current ban, fishermen cannot take rockfish from a depth
greater than 120 feet. Because the species can be taken by mistake
and dies when raised to the surface, the closures could hurt hundreds
of bottom trawlers and long-line fishermen, including Newport's dory
men.</TE>
<TE>   "The new regulations could devastate the last of us," said Frank
Leal, a wiry man of 56 who has been with the dory fleet for 31 years.
"It's a shame. People love us. The place has so much history."</TE>
<TE>   Dory men have had a constant presence in Newport Beach since 1891,
when a Portuguese fisherman began selling his catch on the beach out
of his wooden boat, rather than hauling it to market.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the fleet headquarters has steadily grown from a
cluster of wooden sheds into a heavily timbered compound with 18
stalls, a central market area, and a crusty wharf-like atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   It is a historical landmark, and the fishermen who work there have
inspired poetry and children's books.</TE>
<TE>   "I like this place," said Shiny Bian of Rowland Heights, who, with
her son Felix, has bought sablefish from the dory fleet twice a month
for the last three years. "I always buy two."</TE>
<TE>   If the fleet goes out of business, Newport Beach officials say it
will represent a significant cultural loss for the region. For
decades, the city has used the dory men to promote tourism and local
business.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the traditions that is slowly passing away," said
Marcus DeChevrieux, curator of the Newport Harbor Nautical Museum.
"It just isn't financially viable anymore to take your dory out and
catch fish with hand lines. It's just a man and a boat."</TE>
<TE>   Hours before dawn, the dory men push their 18-foot craft through
the churning surf near the city pier and navigate to their fishing
grounds with watch and compass.</TE>
<TE>   Each sets up to a mile of line fitted with thousands of hooks. The
catch is removed by hand and tossed into the bottom of the boat. It's
tough, physical work.</TE>
<TE>   Outboard engines have replaced sails and oars, but there are no
nets or high-tech electronics. A slicker is the only protection in
case of rain or rough seas.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always been a tough buck," said Baker, a slender man with a
deep tan and a neatly trimmed mustache.</TE>
<TE>   For this reason, some dory men have left to take more predictable,
less arduous jobs. Others shoved off after the 1990 tanker spill in
Huntington Beach that fouled a popular fishing area with crude oil
and slowed sales at the dory fleet's market.</TE>
<TE>   Others still fish, but in different parts of Southern California.
And some have died, like Timothy Meek, 33, who disappeared off
Newport Beach in 1998 while trying to catch enough fish to buy his
son a bicycle for Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Looking around the fleet's headquarters today, there are few, if
any, young people interested in taking over the operations of those
who will be retiring in the years ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Academics and state officials say commercial fishing on the West
Coast has been in steady decline because of a host of factors,
including environmental problems, a warm-water trend, declining fish
stocks and increasing regulations to conserve marine resources.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics from the California Department of Fish and Game show
that commercial landings in the Newport Beach area have plunged over
the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, about 433,000 pounds of seafood valued at $744,000 was
harvested, more than half of it sablefish, rockfish, sculpin and
white croaker. By 2000, the catch had dropped to 212,000 pounds,
worth about $555,000.</TE>
<TE>   The take for Newport Beach represents a fraction of California's
annual harvest, which is now valued at about $550 million, the fifth
largest in the nation, according to Fish and Game officials.</TE>
<TE>   The dory men agree that fish stocks need to be better managed, but
they say they are not the main cause of the excessive harvests that
triggered the federal ban on rockfish. They blame large commercial
operations in Northern California, Oregon and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "They let the bank robbers get away," Leal said as he sliced
strips of meat from his catch of small mackerel. "Now, they are
pointing their fingers at the jaywalkers."</TE>
<TE>   But state Fish and Game officials say the decline of rockfish is
so severe in some cases that the ban must be broadly applied to
replenish the stocks, a task that could take 90 years for bocaccio.
At one time, the fish was a staple at markets in Southern and Central
California.</TE>
<TE>   "The mining of resources has occurred," said L.B. Boydstun, a
government affairs representative for the California Department of
Fish and Game. "We are at such a low point it doesn't matter who is
doing the fishing. Everybody's catch counts."</TE>
<TE>   The department is considering lifting some restrictions on thorny
head, a type of fish the Newport dory men often hook, Boydstun said.
The potential change might ease the pain for the dory men during the
federal ban.</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen affected by the new restrictions, Boydstun said, might
be eligible for a $2.1-million relief program that includes funding
for safety equipment, research and job retraining.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the dory men anxiously await their fate.</TE>
<TE>   They have heard so many rumors and conflicting stories about the
new rules they are no longer sure what is going to happen to them.</TE>
<TE>   Those in their 50s hope to fish for another five years or so and
retire. But for the younger anglers, such as Mitch Breneman, 41, of
Costa Mesa, that might not be an option.</TE>
<TE>   Breneman, whose family has been a fixture at the dory fleet for
decades, used to catch sculpin, but he could not catch enough at
depths of less than 120 feet to make any money.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many rules and regulations, I am limited to sharks
and kingfish," he says as he cleans and filets small smoothhound
sharks for his customers. "If things stay they way they are now, it's
going to kill us."</TE>

<HD>Old Tactic Revived in Bid to Block Oil Drilling</HD>
<DH>Politics: California's congressional delegation hopes to
follow the lead of other states and deny federal funding, forcing the
buyback of leases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's congressional delegation hopes this week to choke off
federal money needed to permit new oil drilling off Southern
California's coast, adopting a ploy used by their colleagues from
other states to force the buyback of offshore oil leases.</LD>
<LD>   "It worked for other states," Rep. Lois Capps (D-Santa Barbara)
said Saturday as she unveiled the strategy. "We don't want these
leases to continue in California. We want to encourage the Bush
administration to sit down with oil companies and negotiate a
settlement."</LD>
<LD>   The delegation's effort was born of frustration with Bush
officials, who have agreed to buy back offshore leases off Florida,
but declined to do the same off California.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Capps and other Democrats on the House floor will try
to amend the spending bill for the Interior Department, cutting off
any funding to approve drilling on 36 offshore oil tracts off the
coast of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.</TE>
<TE>   Without federal permits in hand, oil companies cannot sink
exploratory wells or begin pumping crude.</TE>
<TE>   If successful, the ban on spending would act as an "insurance
policy" against new drilling, Capps said, should California lose its
ongoing court battle with the Bush administration over the state's
rights to review drilling plans in federal waters.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge sided with California last year, suspending all
activity on these 36 tracts. The case is now on appeal to the U.S.
9th Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't new for Congress to dictate policy by clamping down on
dollars. Congress has used such a chokehold on the Interior
Department's annual budget for 21 years to safeguard the rest of the
West Coast, and most of the East Coast, from leasing new undersea
areas to oil companies.</TE>
<TE>   But this annual moratorium has not covered offshore leases already
in the hands of oil companies--with a couple of exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1980s, Congress extended the moratorium to areas
already leased to oil firms in the salmon-rich waters of Bristol Bay,
and in the early 1990s it did the same for leases off North
Carolina's Outer Banks.</TE>
<TE>   In both cases, the de facto ban on drilling helped nudge the
Interior Department to reimburse oil companies for leases they were
not allowed to develop.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Florida congressional delegation used a similar
ploy to eclipse Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton's proposal for more
leasing off the Florida panhandle.</TE>
<TE>   Capps and others draw a connection between this congressional
action and the Bush administration's decision in May to spent $115
million to retire leases off the Florida coast. Other Democrats have
interpreted the Florida deal as a political gift designed to help the
president's brother, Republican Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, win reelection
in November.</TE>
<TE>   In a briefing paper circulating on Capitol Hill, Capps, Rep.
George Miller (D-Martinez) and Nick J. Rahall II of West Virginia,
the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Resources Committee, point
to last year's Florida action as an example of a similar vote that
won bipartisan support.</TE>
<TE>   The Florida vote passed 247 to 184, with 70 Republicans joining
Democrats to instruct the Interior Department on offshore oil
matters. Backers of the same idea for California hope to gather
bipartisan support Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   But Florida's delegation is dominated by Republicans. It's unclear
if California's largely Democratic delegation can win the same kind
of support in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco, who as the Democratic whip
lines up votes, through a spokesman called Tuesday's amendment a
"high priority for California Democrats and environmental groups."</TE>
<TE>   If successful, Capps' measure "would force the hand of the White
House to get something cooked up for California in the way it has to
protect the coast Florida," said Richard Charter, a longtime
oil-drilling opponent with Environmental Defense.</TE>
<TE>   Nuevo Energy Co. of Houston, which owns an interest in most of the
36 tracts, has sought a buyout. It wants to recoup the dollars tied
up in California leases and reinvest them in more promising offshore
areas such as the Gulf of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Nuevo and other energy firms earlier this year filed a
breach-of-contract suit against the federal government, complaining
of delays and ever-changing rules that have thwarted their ability to
produce oil from the 36 tracts.</TE>
<TE>   Capps' proposal to cut off funding targets only those sites, which
were leased to oil companies between 1968 and 1984 but have never
gone into production.</TE>
<TE>   It would have no effect on the other 43 leases in federal waters
which are pumping oil and gas, or those active wells in state waters
within three miles of shore. These active tracts can be spotted by
the oil platforms that dot the coast off Huntington Beach, Long
Beach, and Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.</TE>
<TE>   Norton last month rejected Gov. Gray Davis' request that her
department buy back offshore drilling rights on the 36 tracts as it
did in Florida. In her letter, she cited California's history of
offshore oil production to conclude, "Florida opposes coastal
drilling and California does not."</TE>
<TE>   About 10 days later, on June 19, she wrote to Davis' gubernatorial
opponent, Republican Bill Simon, and sounded interested in
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to extend our hand to join the state of California
and all other leaseholders and stakeholders in crafting a solution
that will protect your truly magnificent coastal areas," she wrote.</TE>

<HD>Understanding Where They're Coming From</HD>
<DH>Hotline offers aid and advice to Asian immigrants who find
themselves in desperate situations and don't know where to turn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIN CHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kim Luu and her six co-workers never see the callers' faces.</LD>
<LD>   They will never meet 42-year-old Tranh Tran and her cash-strapped
Westminster family, never hug the terrified 70-year-old woman who has
just been evicted and never personally comfort the battered women
seeking divorces but petrified of losing their immigration status.</LD>
<LD>   But they've talked. And that's enough to touch the callers' lives.</LD>
<TE>   Luu and her colleagues work at a toll-free hotline, the Asian
Language Legal Intake Project. They use their language skills and
experiences--Luu's family fled North Vietnam when she was an
infant--to add resonance to their advice.</TE>
<TE>   With their fluent Vietnamese and Mandarin, they help Tran
understand her family's eligibility for Medi-Cal and food stamps,
assist the 70-year-old woman in finding a place to live and advise
abused women how they can stay in the country while staying away from
their husbands.</TE>
<TE>   Through the free hotline, which officially made its debut last
week, Luu and other project employees calm anxious callers and even
elicit laughs from those who don't know where else to turn.</TE>
<TE>   "These people are desperate for information," said Juliet Stone,
29, the project's supervising attorney. "This is so needed in the
community."</TE>
<TE>   The project links four legal service organizations in Los Angeles
and Orange counties--the Asian Pacific American Legal Center, the
Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, Neighborhood Legal Services and
the Legal Aid Society of Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Callers dial (800) 267-7395 for Vietnamese-language assistance, or
(800) 520-2356 for Mandarin. An employee records personal information
and determines, on the basis of income and place of residence, if a
caller is eligible for assistance. After a two-month pilot program,
the hotline is now in full operation. Plans are to expand the effort
to include Korean and Khmer, the main Cambodian language, by next
year.</TE>
<TE>   A confused Tran called Luu a few weeks ago seeking advice on
Medi-Cal, a term she had heard since arriving two months ago from Ho
Chi Minh city, the former Saigon.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of these people come from an inherently repressive regime,"
Luu said. "They don't think of going to the government for assistance
and public benefits."</TE>
<TE>   Luu recorded Tran's basic information and described Medi-Cal's
medical assistance programs, advising Tran of her rights and finding
a location close to Tran's Westminster home where she could apply.</TE>
<TE>   The hotline staff can elicit information that would be difficult,
if not impossible, in English. Luu recently spent an hour on the
phone with a distraught woman.</TE>
<TE>   "She just kept crying," Luu said. "We have to be extremely patient
with them."</TE>
<TE>   The woman had called the day before she was to be evicted from her
apartment. After coaxing information from the woman, Luu called the
elder-abuse hotline. Although the woman was evicted, Luu's
resourcefulness and a social worker's efforts found her a place at a
senior citizens facility.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking for a new way of serving the underserved
community," said Bob Cohen, executive director of the Legal Aid
Society of Orange County. "Anything we can do to get out in the
community, to make folks aware of how easy it is to get service, that
they won't be ripped off, is important.... "</TE>
<TE>   According to census data, the Vietnamese population in Orange
County jumped by nearly 89% between 1990 and 2000, while the Chinese
population increased by 44%.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, the Vietnamese population rose nearly 25%
in the decade, while the Chinese population leaped by more than 34%.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1.5 million Asians and Pacific Islanders now live in the
two counties. Many have little or no English skills.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart Kwoh, president of the Asian Pacific American Legal
Center, said the idea of a hotline had been tossed around for years.
But the latest census figures and an influx of grant money convinced
center staff members that the time had come to begin the program.</TE>
<TE>   Kwoh's efforts have raised more than $300,000 from the Open
Society Institute and the Community Technology Foundation of
California to anchor the hotline.</TE>
<TE>   Staff members have appeared on Vietnamese radio and Mandarin
television to publicize the program.</TE>
<TE>   Tran called the hotline after her sister heard Luu on Bolsa Radio,
106.3 FM. The broadcasts have made Luu a celebrity of sorts. Callers
regularly greet her with: "Ms. Kim, I have this problem and I need
your help."</TE>
<TE>   In part, hotline workers gain immigrants' faith because they
understand where their callers are coming from--literally.</TE>
<TE>   When she glances down at the tattoo on her right forearm, staff
attorney Anita Le's forehead furrows in pain at the bold black
letters that spell out "Le Quang Thai Ha." That's the name of the
sister who never made it out of Vietnam--who at age 15, drowned when
bullets tore through the boat in which she was trying to escape.</TE>
<TE>   "We never forget where we came from," said Le, 29, who arrived in
the United States six years after her sister's death. "We're in a
vacuum without helping others."</TE>
<TE>   Stories stream from Luu, too, of how she and her parents fled
North Vietnam in 1979. She described how her family sat waist-deep in
water for two weeks on a leaky fishing boat to Hong Kong, how her
father gave up his own ration of rice to feed his family, how they
settled in Louisville, Ky., with $100 and a gold wedding ring among
them.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, I'm giving back to the community I grew up in," said
Luu, 24, who lives in Alhambra. "The fact that I speak Vietnamese
every day reconfirms that I'm still very Vietnamese.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though I'm American, I can relate to them. I understand the
depths of their pain."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Siegfried Hansen, 90; Space Suit Pioneer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Siegfried Hansen, an electrical engineer and inveterate tinkerer who
50 years ago pioneered the hard space suit only now being used in
NASA missions, died of pneumonia June 28 at a convalescent home in
West Los Angeles. He was 90.</LD>
<LD>   In the 1950s, Hansen headed a Litton Industries team devoted to
improving the vacuum tube, a key component of electronic devices from
radar to the early television. The vacuum tube had many flaws, and
Litton was keen to build a better one.</LD>
<LD>   In Hansen's view, the way to improve the vacuum tube was to modify
and test it from the inside--a brilliant, impossible feat. No one
could survive in the airless atmosphere of a vacuum.</LD>
<TE>   Litton commissioned a vacuum chamber large enough for a man to
maneuver in. Hansen and his colleagues then designed a suit to be
worn inside the chamber that mimicked the atmospheric conditions
conducive to human life.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, dubbed the Mark I, weighed 50 pounds and looked like a
Buck Rogers fantasy. It had a rigid torso of aluminum, puffy
rubberized appendages, ribbed joints and a helmet as square and
ungainly as a comic book robot.</TE>
<TE>   More important than its appearance, though, was its function:
Unlike previous pressure suits, it maintained constant volume and
geometry, which allowed the occupant to breathe inside the vacuum and
to move with enough dexterity to handle a screw driver or power
drill.</TE>
<TE>   As transistor technology rendered the vacuum tube obsolete,
Hansen's ingenious suit appeared headed for the same obscurity.</TE>
<TE>   "Luckily, this suit at Litton happened to be reaching antiquity at
about the same time as the birth of the space age," said Gary L.
Harris, a space suit designer and historian in St. Cloud, Fla., near
Cape Canaveral.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what saved it from being put on the scrap heap. It had all
the attributes of an extravehicular space suit."</TE>
<TE>   He called Hansen "the father of the EVA," the extravehicular
activity suit made expressly to sustain humans as they work outside a
spacecraft above the Earth's atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen was born in San Francisco, where his father ran a bakery
and ice cream store.</TE>
<TE>   He majored in electrical engineering at the University of
Washington in Seattle, where he met his wife, Gwendolyn. They were
married in 1939.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, Hansen lived in London and helped design
early radar systems. After the war, he moved to Schenectady, N.Y., to
work on vacuum tubes for General Electric, and helped GE develop the
picture tube. He owned what may have been the first television in
Schenectady.</TE>
<TE>   In 1946, he moved to California to join Hughes Aircraft. He often
tested new radar equipment with the company's eccentric founder,
Howard Hughes, as the test pilot.</TE>
<TE>   Although visionary in many respects, Hughes resisted efforts to
channel more resources into advanced electronics.</TE>
<TE>   His reluctance spurred the departure of Charles B. Thornton, Hugh
W. Jamieson and Roy L. Ash, who in 1953 became partners in a small
microwave tube company in San Carlos owned by Charles Litton. They
moved operations to Beverly Hills and hired scientists like Hansen,
with the intention of concentrating on space research.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen, Litton's director of research, set to work in 1954 to
develop the manned vacuum chamber. But when he surveyed the existing
aviation pressure suits, he found none appropriate to the task before
him at Litton. They were too clumsy and lacked mobility.</TE>
<TE>   What he came up with, in 1955, was a hybrid of hard and soft
materials that provided strength and flexibility. A key feature was
the jointed ribbing that allowed the wearer to bend his arms a full
90 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen was the first person to test the suit inside the chamber.
The risks were considerable. There was no air inside the 15-by-9-foot
chamber, described by one observer as "just one big pot of nothing."
Any failure in the suit could mean unconsciousness in seconds and
death in minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen put on the contraption over long red underwear and breathed
almost pure oxygen through a connecting hose. Doctors monitored his
respiration, heart beat and blood pressure through special
attachments.</TE>
<TE>   He would begin the experiments by dropping two feathers, which
fell like lumps of lead. Then he would light a vacuum tube to prove
the absence of air.</TE>
<TE>   When an interviewer observing an early demonstration asked him how
it felt inside, Hansen just shrugged it off. "He was not a very
outward person," said his son, Gordon, a Brentwood electrical
engineer. "He was the kind of person who didn't say anything unless
absolutely necessary."</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force quickly recognized that the suit had other uses.</TE>
<TE>   "In the mid-'50s, the prospect of space travel was becoming real,"
said Doug Langtry, historian at the Air Force Museum at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. "The Air Force was
interested, not in vacuum tubes, but in keeping people alive up
there."</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force helped fund experiments at Litton in the late 1950s.
Fearing public ridicule and the disapproval of the Eisenhower
administration, however, it prohibited anyone involved in the project
from using the words "space suit." The suit was called a "manipulator
station."</TE>
<TE>   Then the Russians launched Sputnik in October 1957. That event so
transformed the climate for space exploration in the U.S. that, by
December, Hansen was modeling the suit on the cover of Look magazine.</TE>
<TE>   He remained at Litton until 1959, when he returned to Hughes to
work on space chambers. He retired in the late 1970s, but continued
as a consultant for another decade.</TE>
<TE>   When he wasn't working or sailing, Hansen was inventing gadgets.
He built an automatic frankfurter roaster, a stereo binocular
microscope for removing his sons' splinters, and a reminder device, a
clock loaded with punch cards that popped up at crucial
times."Inventive ability cannot be acquired if you are not born with
it," Hansen, who held hundreds of patents, once told an interviewer.
"It is not a science, but one of the creative arts."</TE>
<TE>   Hansen was not unusual in the somewhat circuitous route that led
him to the space suit.</TE>
<TE>   Space suit design was not a subject taught in school, so its
innovators were people like Russell Colley, a thwarted dress designer
who went to work for rubber maker B.F. Goodrich in the 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   In collaboration with barnstorming aviator Wiley Post, he
fashioned a soft-bodied, high-altitude pressure suit that became the
model for those later used in the Mercury flights. The aviation
pressure suits that were the forebears of the space suit were made by
people who designed bras and girdles.</TE>
<TE>   Soft suits that evolved from Colley's designs have dominated the
U.S. space program because they are lighter and take up less room
than the bulkier hard suit.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen "rejected all the soft fabric technology" in favor of the
greater durability and mobility offered by a hard suit, said Harris,
the Florida space suit designer and historian. But the Litton hard
suit was never used in space missions.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly half a century later, the search for a better space suit
continues. For the first time, NASA has turned to a suit with a hard
upper torso for space shuttle astronauts. Conceptually, it owes much
to Hansen, whose vision preceded the space program by years.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how futuristic Hansen was," Harris said. "[His] ideas are
still ahead of us. "</TE>
<TE>   Hansen's wife of 58 years died in 1997. In addition to his son
Gordon, he is survived by sons Burton of Key West, Fla., Norman of
Kennewick, Wash., and Warren of Redmond, Wash.; nine grandchildren;
and seven great-grandchildren.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter Michael Harrigan, a lifelong journalist who worked for both the
Los Angeles Times and the Orange County Register, died in his sleep
of a heart attack early Saturday morning. He was 53.</LD>
<LD>   Harrigan grew up in the newspaper business in Colebrook, N.H.,
where he was born. His father was publisher there of the News and
Sentinel, a weekly newspaper now run by his brother, John. Harrigan
began his newspaper career delivering papers, working as a "printer's
devil" and eventually filling in as editor of the small, rural
newspaper from time to time.</LD>
<LD>   He attended Mount Herman School in Northfield, Mass., before
studying at Harvard University, where he earned his bachelor's degree
in American government in 1971.</LD>
<TE>   Following graduation, he was drafted into the Army and was
stationed in South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   After his discharge, Harrigan returned to New Hampshire, where he
worked six years as a reporter for the Union Leader in Manchester.</TE>
<TE>   In the winter of 1979, he took his wife, Kay, and their then-4
1/2-year-old daughter, Sarah, on a six-month, cross-country odyssey
and job search that brought them to Orange County, where he took an
editing position with the Register, which he left in 1983 to join The
Times.</TE>
<TE>   Yearning to return to Asia, in 1989 he took an editing position in
Tokyo with Pacific Stars and Stripes, a daily tabloid published for
U.S. servicemen in Asia.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to The Times in 1996 as a design editor, helping to
select and place news stories throughout the first two sections of
the paper in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   His heart attack was unexpected, according to his wife, who said
he was health-conscious and had regular physical exams. An avid
runner, he took part every year in the Heart &amp; Sole Walk/Run
benefiting the American Heart Assn.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Kay, and daughter Rachel, both of
Tustin; daughter Sarah of San Jose; a brother, John, of Colebrook,
N.H.; and sisters Susan, of New York City, and Mary, of Colebrook,
N.H.</TE>
<TE>   Arrangements for a memorial service are pending at Saddleback
Chapel Mortuary, 220 E. Main St., Tustin, (714) 544-1450.</TE>

<HD>$10,000 Is Sought for Defense of Man Who Videotaped Beating</HD>
<DH>Coalition: Inglewood community leaders say the fugitive's
alleged offenses were 'minor.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Waving four checks in the air, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles)
announced Saturday that a coalition of Inglewood organizations and
leaders is trying to raise $10,000 for the legal defense of Mitchell
Crooks, the man who videotaped Inglewood police officers beating a
16-year-old boy last week.</LD>
<LD>   Crooks was arrested Thursday on outstanding warrants for burglary
and a 5-year-old hit-and-run accident in Placer County, where the
warrants originated, after media attention on his role in bringing
the Inglewood beating to light alerted authorities to his
whereabouts.</LD>
<LD>   Waters said the group had already collected more than $3,000 for
Crooks, and hoped to collect the entire sum within 10 days.</LD>
<TE>   "We are going to see to it that Mr. Crooks has a legal defense,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We will go to Placer," she continued. "We will stand with him. We
will help to pay his lawyers. We will support his bail. We will do
whatever is necessary to say to citizens, when you come forward, when
you are willing to stand up, when you see abuse by the police
department or anybody else, we are gonna honor you.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't care what he's been accused of," she added.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are minor offenses, we have learned, and we are going to
help him out."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles sheriff's deputies have said they were questioning
Donovan Jackson's father about expired tags on his car's license
plates when Jeremy J. Morse and three other Inglewood police officers
suddenly arrived and became involved in a confrontation with Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Crooks, who was staying in a motel across the street from the gas
station where the incident occurred, recorded two minutes of the
confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   That video, which has been repeatedly broadcast on television
news, shows Morse lifting a limp, handcuffed Donovan Jackson by his
clothes, smashing his head on a car trunk and then punching him in
the face.</TE>
<TE>   An Inglewood police report obtained by The Times showed that
Jackson had been punched twice by another officer before the action
on Crooks' tape began.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the newly formed coalition, which included Inglewood
ministers, block leaders, the city's chief administrative officer and
Danny Bakewell of the Brotherhood Crusade, met Saturday morning in
private at the True Vine Baptist Church.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference, participants said they had discussed how
they might monitor the current investigations into the officers'
actions. The group is considering the need for a civilian police
board, a review of police training and an evaluation of the
responsibilities of the Inglewood police chief.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday evening, about 300 people crammed into Faith United
Methodist Church in Inglewood to decry the beating of Jackson. Waters
and comedian Dick Gregory were there.</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, members of the Inglewood-based National Alliance
for Positive Action announced at a community meeting that their
organization was forming a citizens panel to make recommendations for
the Inglewood Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   And Inglewood Mayor Roosevelt Dorn, who previously had said that
Morse should be fired and prosecuted, now urged residents to allow
the legal system to take its course.</TE>
<TE>   "I never suggested we should set aside due process," he said at
the National Alliance meeting. Dorn, a former judge, wore a large
belt buckle adorned with a judge's gavel over his blue jeans.</TE>
<TE>   "My personal opinion hasn't changed" about the nature of the
incident, he said, "but due process, justice, must be done."</TE>
<TE>   At both morning meetings, community leaders said that Inglewood
residents were capable of accomplishing whatever reform might be
required.</TE>
<TE>   "For now, we need to work with the Inglewood family to address a
family problem," Daniel K. Tabor, a former Inglewood city councilman,
said at the True Vine Baptist Church.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to also acknowledge that we are organizing, not just to
address our internal problem," Tabor continued, "but to also support
Mitchell Crooks, who is a hero."</TE>
<TE>   Bakewell said members of the Inglewood community plan to organize
a massive celebration for Crooks when he leaves jail. "Our community
wants to see him and welcome him as a family member," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "As a matter of fact," Waters said, "we are going to ask the mayor
to block off a whole block. And we are going to invite the entire
community. We are going to have the biggest welcome party you have
ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   As another check was added to her pile, she shook it in the air in
front of a bank of television cameras. "Ooh! Thank you! Another
$200!"</TE>

<HD>Yousuf Karsh, 93; Photographs Captured Face of 20th Century</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yousuf Karsh, whose formal photographs of many of the 20th century's
great names in the arts, politics and science made him one of the
world's best-known portrait photographers, died Saturday in Boston.
He was 93.</LD>
<LD>   Karsh died of complications from surgery at Brigham and Women's
Hospital, according to a hospital spokeswoman. No further details of
his medical condition were released.</LD>
<LD>   Based in Ottawa for much of his career, Karsh was perhaps best
known for his portrait of Winston Churchill. But his subjects
included Ernest Hemingway, Graham Greene, Albert Schweitzer, Helen
Keller and Pablo Picasso, and his photographs of them and thousands
of others were memorable as well.</LD>
<TE>   "Karsh was the master of presenting the image of the person he was
photographing," said Stephen White, a Los Angeles-based collector and
photography dealer. "Karsh wanted to present his subjects as they
were seen by the rest of the world, as larger-than-life characters."</TE>
<TE>   More often than not, he succeeded in doing just that.</TE>
<TE>   His photograph of Churchill was taken during the British prime
minister's 1941 visit to Ottawa to elicit support for the war effort
against Germany.</TE>
<TE>   The cigar-chomping statesman agreed to a formal sitting but gave
the photographer only two minutes to make his portrait. The resulting
image of Churchill leaning forward slightly, with a hard, determined
look in his eye and a clenched jaw, ended up on the cover of Life
magazine and was widely circulated in North America and Britain. The
photograph came to symbolize the defiant nature of a beleaguered
country at war.</TE>
<TE>   As the story goes, Karsh was able to get that expression from
Churchill by pulling a cigar from the prime minister's mouth a moment
before the shutter clicked.</TE>
<TE>   Karsh was born in Mardin, Turkey, a trading center in the heavily
Armenian area of what was then the Ottoman Empire. His childhood
there was not happy, and he would always remember the violence
visited upon him and other Armenians by Turks. As a boy he carried
rocks in his pockets to fend off attacks from Turkish children.</TE>
<TE>   His family eventually sent him off to the safety of an uncle's
home in Canada. Karsh arrived in Nova Scotia in 1924 with dreams of
going into medicine but became interested in his uncle's photography
studio.</TE>
<TE>   Karsh soon dropped out of school to work at the studio full time
and began taking photographs on his own with an inexpensive camera.
One of his early pictures, a landscape, won a contest at a local
department store.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing his nephew's aptitude with the camera, his uncle sent him
off to Boston to study with John H. Garo, a well-known painter and
portrait photographer.</TE>
<TE>   Karsh would later say that it was there he learned about the
nuances of natural light in photography and natural lightness in
life, noting that Garo wrapped up his work each day around 4 p.m. to,
as Karsh put it, "hold court" with friends over cocktails.</TE>
<TE>   Karsh returned to Canada with an interest in portraiture and
personalities. He moved to Ottawa, opened a photographic studio and
began experimenting with the same sort of artificial stage lighting
he noticed being used in the city's theater district.</TE>
<TE>   He developed a formal photographic style that used light to model
the faces of those sitting for him. His backgrounds were often
simple, spare and solid black, his compositions tight and quite
exact.</TE>
<TE>   "My quest in making a photograph is for a quality that I know
exists in the personality before me," Karsh told an interviewer some
years ago. "I'm looking for what I sometimes call 'the inward power,'
and I am more anxious to capture that, or at least interpret it to my
own satisfaction, than I am to create the facsimile of an interesting
figure with no depth of soul."</TE>
<TE>   Although he was making a steady living as a portrait photographer
in Ottawa, the Churchill picture marked a turning point in his
career. His work became widely known and led to new and more
interesting opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   With partial funding from the Canadian magazine Saturday Night,
Karsh traveled to England in 1943 for a strenuous two-month visit
that yielded 42 major portraits, including those of prominent
statesmen and members of the royal family.</TE>
<TE>   On an assignment from Life, he went to Washington the next year to
photograph more than 70 leading figures in Congress, the Cabinet and
the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   The first of his many books of photographs, "Faces of Destiny,"
released in 1947, is made up of pictures from these two trips along
with Karsh's anecdotal comments.</TE>
<TE>   Although many of his subjects would visit Ottawa to sit for him,
Karsh traveled widely, capturing Pope Pius XII in the Vatican, Queen
Elizabeth II and Prince Philip at Buckingham Palace and cellist Pablo
Casals in the south of France.</TE>
<TE>   (The Casals photograph is interesting in that it shows the
musician with his back to the camera playing his cello in the ruins
of an abbey.)</TE>
<TE>   A dapper, intense man with brown eyes, a disarming manner and a
winning smile, Karsh also supported the Muscular Dystrophy Assn.,
photographing the child for its annual poster.</TE>
<TE>   His work was shown widely, including in exhibits at the
International Center of Photography in New York City; the Santa
Barbara Museum of Art (in a joint show with the work of Margaret
Bourke-White); the National Gallery of Canada; and London's National
Portrait Gallery.</TE>
<TE>   Karsh gave up photography in the early 1990s; his last portrait
was of President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the artist's job," Karsh said in his autobiography, "to
accomplish two things--to stir the emotions of the viewer and to lay
bare the soul of his subject."</TE>
<TE>   And while he may have stirred the emotions of the viewer, some
observers in later years criticized Karsh's work as being "overlit
and monotonously predictable."</TE>
<TE>   Celebrity portraiture went in different directions, as reflected
in the work of Richard Avedon, Annie Liebovitz and Helmut Newton.
Those directions were far less formal and far more revealing. But for
the traditional formal sitting portrait, there were few better than
Karsh.</TE>
<TE>   His first wife, Solange Gauthier, died in 1961. He is survived by
his second wife, Estrellita Maria Nachbar. A private funeral will
take place in Ottawa, and a memorial service will be held at a later
date.</TE>

<HD>Legal Fees Skyrocketing</HD>
<DH>Finances: The increase reflects a standoff between faculty
union and administration.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Since Philip Westin became chancellor six years ago, the Ventura
County Community College District has shouldered a more-than-tenfold
increase in legal fees, a rise that reflects a standoff between a
disgruntled faculty union and an administration under fire.</LD>
<LD>   Records show the district's annual bills for legal advice climbed
from $69,432 during Westin's first year in 1996, to $527,078 the
following year. It has since increased to more than $933,000 for the
2001-02 fiscal year, which ended June 30.</LD>
<LD>   That puts the district's legal fees well above those for
comparable-sized college districts in California. The Coast and
Contra Costa community college districts consistently spend less.
Last year they reported legal expenses of $335,227 and $149,257,
respectively.</LD>
<TE>   "Why has it gone up so much so fast?" asked Don Facciano,
president of the Ventura County Taxpayers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd put this in the same category of the board of trustees not
overseeing Westin's expenses," he said. "Their job is not to
rubber-stamp financial decisions. If it's justifiable, so be it, but
at this point we need to look at everything."</TE>
<TE>   The district's legal fees have drawn attention in the controversy
surrounding Westin's spending practices. The Camarillo-based law firm
of Wood &amp; Bender reported to trustees last spring that Westin had
been reimbursed for more than $119,000 in business-related expenses
from 1997 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Westin filed a complaint with the State Bar of
California, accusing the firm of attempting to oust him to gain
control of the district's lucrative legal services contract.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys David Bender and David Wood have denied the allegation.</TE>
<TE>   Bender was the district's general counsel during Westin's first
two years as chancellor, when legal fees shot up dramatically. Bender
left the district in 1998 to work for a software company.</TE>
<TE>   Since his departure, however, the district's legal fees have
ranged from $400,000 to more than $900,000.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Jack Lipton, who replaced Bender as general counsel, says
the faculty union is to blame for the bills.</TE>
<TE>   Union grievances and lawsuits account for at least half of the
district's legal fees in recent years. Under previous
administrations, the union squeezed unwarranted settlements out of
the district simply because officials feared litigation, Lipton said.</TE>
<TE>   When Westin came on board, he and the trustees felt that the best
way to discourage frivolous complaints was for the district to hold
its ground.</TE>
<TE>   "When the district administration is confronted with lawsuits,
they have the option of just caving into demands they don't think are
reasonable or vigorously defending the district's position," Lipton
said. "Since I've been general counsel, when the board feels it is
right, it wants to defend its position."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Miller, president of the Ventura County Federation of
College Teachers, dismissed that explanation. Instead, he said,
Westin's mission is to break the union--which represents 1,069
part-time and 413 full-time instructors--by fighting nearly every
complaint and slowly draining the union's resources.</TE>
<TE>   "For 25 years we were able to settle grievances before they cost
any money," Miller said. "The union leadership has been largely the
same people for 25 years. The faculty hasn't changed much. The only
thing that's changed is the advent of Westin's administration."</TE>
<TE>   The district could not provide a full accounting of grievances
filed during Westin's tenure or a comparison of settlements paid
prior to and since the chancellor's hiring.</TE>
<TE>   And Westin denies trying to dismantle the union, saying that final
decisions about whether to settle cases are made by the five-member
board of trustees, not him.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Westin said, he is concerned about rising legal
costs and is determined to get them under control. Last week he said
he had slashed this year's legal budget to $450,000.</TE>
<TE>   To achieve that goal, he instituted a new policy requiring
administrators to get permission from him or another executive before
calling Lipton.</TE>
<TE>   The district pays Lipton a fixed rate of $1,325 a day, three days
per week, and $185 for each additional hour his services are needed.
Lipton said the district often requires more than three days of work
each week and frequently needs advice from other specialists at his
firm.</TE>
<TE>   Westin also has asked newly hired Vice Chancellor Bill Studt, a
former Oxnard schools superintendent, to be the administration's
liaison with the faculty union.</TE>
<TE>   Already, Westin said, Studt has resolved two union complaints
before they became formal grievances.</TE>
<TE>   "We're spending too much money fighting the union, and have been
for some time now," Westin said. "Throwing mud at them isn't going to
accomplish anything. But it takes two sides to lower the decibel
level. It takes two to dance."</TE>
<TE>   Records show district legal fees first surged in 1997 and 1998, as
the union threatened a strike. A strike was averted, but by then, the
administration and union leadership were polarized.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1999, the district has dealt with at least 43 grievances and
lawsuits, records show.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of cases involved student injuries or complaints against
instructors. The majority of those were brought against the district
by the union and individual faculty members.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, the union complained about the district's decision to
pay a part-time music instructor, who was a professional musician, at
a PhD scale even though he did not hold a doctorate.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Korn, the union's grievance chairman, said full-time
instructors could be paid at higher scales but that the union did not
believe the same flexibility applied to part-time teachers.</TE>
<TE>   The difference in salary the two sides were arguing over amounted
to about $1 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Korn said, it was a battle worth fighting on principle.
"They could have come to us and said, 'We've got this great
instructor, but we can't get him to come here unless we pay him $1 an
hour more,' " Korn said. "But they didn't ask. They just did it."</TE>
<TE>   The district fought the union's efforts to force the matter into
binding arbitration, but that is where the case ended up. The
arbitration panel sided with the administration and allowed the
higher salary.</TE>
<TE>   Korn said the union later requested public records and discovered
the district had spent nearly $83,000 making its case, compared with
the union's $5,000 legal bill.</TE>
<TE>   "They can file a one-page grievance--it can even be handwritten,"
said Lipton, the district's lawyer. "And in response to that, in
order to protect the district's position, we have to do an extensive
job in preparing a thorough response. So it's not surprising to me
that the district's costs would be much greater than the union's."</TE>
<TE>   The most expensive and complex of pending cases involves Paula
Munoz, a former Ventura College program coordinator whom the district
demoted and suspended, after accusing her of discriminating against a
female faculty member because she was Mexican.</TE>
<TE>   Four of Munoz's colleagues and associates also were suspended or
punished for their alleged treatment of the woman.</TE>
<TE>   Munoz and the others have accused the district of waging a
vendetta against them for personal reasons and of sending a strong
message that Westin and Ventura College President Larry Calderon
shouldn't be second-guessed.</TE>
<TE>   Their collective grievances, pending administrative hearings and a
lawsuit Munoz recently filed have cost the district nearly $500,000
in legal fees. Westin has estimated the legal fees could reach $1
million by the time the cases are resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Korn, the union grievance chairman, called the demotions and
suspension a "witch hunt."</TE>
<TE>   Westin said he had good reason to discipline the faculty members
and stands by his actions. "I don't want another person discriminated
against at our colleges," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Another case that underscores the tension between the union and
Westin involves the Ventura County Sheriff's Academy, whose classes
are taught by law enforcement officers.</TE>
<TE>   The faculty union says wearing a badge shouldn't prevent those
instructors from being subject to the same rules and oversight as
other faculty--and from mandatory representation by the faculty
union.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has argued the academy is a special situation
and that its instructors, who are not paid by the college district,
should remain exempt.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not just throw the whole thing out and not have the union
represent anybody, which is what I think the district would like to
do," Korn said. "Next thing, it'll be Amgen teaching math classes for
free. I think it's a union-busting tactic, frankly. In the 30 years
I've been in this college district, I've never seen any chancellor as
anti-union as Phil Westin."</TE>
<TE>   An administrative panel has upheld Westin's position on the
sheriff's academy. The union has filed an appeal.</TE>

<LD>It was probably a combination of factors that did it--the summer
heat, the ghost of Rodney King, the unsettling reminder that our
lives are being videotaped by people we can't see. But the footage of
the July 6 altercation in Inglewood, and last week's public quarrel
over the meaning of it, stirred passions across Southern California
and beyond.</LD>
<LD>   We all watched the same video and saw a thousand different things,
depending on the lens through which we see the world.</LD>
<LD>   The white cop was a hero or a monster. The black 16-year-old he
pounded was a subject of sympathy or scorn.</LD>
<TE>   Race was a central factor or it had no role at all.</TE>
<TE>   I wrote that Officer Jeremy Morse should be fired and prosecuted
for slamming a handcuffed Donovan Jackson onto the trunk and punching
him in the face, and about half the 300-plus readers who responded
were in agreement. But the mail from the other side included some of
the most vicious reactions to anything I've written in 27 years at
the keyboard.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll bet you make a career writing about and defending minority
criminals," began a typical e-mail. "Look around you in Inglewood,
Compton, and South-Central L.A. It is a sewer, filled with
sewage....You are pathetic."</TE>
<TE>   If I were an honest man, others said, I'd admit that having to
deal with African Americans and "your people" is no picnic for cops.
I don't know which of my people they were referring to--the Italians
or the Spaniards. But I got the clear impression from more than one
reader that my ilk are definitely part of the problem and not the
solution.</TE>
<TE>   I was called a fool, a scumbag, a moron, a dummy, a coward, an
ignoramus, a sicko, fecal matter, a hysteric and Mr. Nutsense.</TE>
<TE>   All of that was OK--my wife has called me most of those things and
worse. But what really got to me was the challenge to my manhood. It
had to do with my writing that if Officer Morse had been grabbed in
the privates, as he claimed, he still shouldn't have struck Jackson
in the face.</TE>
<TE>   "If you wouldn't punch a man in the face for grabbing your
[privates], you obviously have no [privates]," wrote a reader named
Wade, one of a few dozen people, mostly men, who expressed similar
feelings.</TE>
<TE>   Just to clear the record, if someone grabbed me there--as a reader
named Robert of Marina del Rey kindly offered to do--yes, I would
punch him in the face.</TE>
<TE>   I never expected any news event in my career to produce so much
mail about testicles, but that's part of what has given the story its
legs. It also has turned legions of people into amateur detectives.</TE>
<TE>   "Two points about this fabrication," wrote a reader named Gary.
"(1) If the officer's testicles had been grabbed with any force at
all, we should see some sort of facial reaction on his part. (2)
Morse would have been rendered incapable of delivering such a
forceful blow with his fist."</TE>
<TE>   True enough, Morse doesn't double over in agony, jerk away swiftly
or have his eyes roll back in his head. If he did any of those
things, I would have caught it, because I have now seen the tape more
times than I've seen the Zapruder film.</TE>
<TE>   If it did happen, OK, I can understand Morse throwing a punch if
he thought that was the only way to free up his boys. But he'd
already lost his cool before that moment.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, after putting up a fight, was put down on the ground and
his hands were cuffed behind his back. At that point, a well-trained
officer doesn't: (A) pick up the suspect and slam his head into a
trunk, (B) get close enough for the suspect to grab him, or (C) punch
him in the face.</TE>
<TE>   So why is it that greater Los Angeles sees this incident from such
diametrically opposed viewpoints? Because we live in separate worlds
and know next to nothing of each other.</TE>
<TE>   I heard from black readers who told me they avoid driving at night
in certain neighborhoods for fear of being pulled over, and I heard
from white readers who told me they resent the race card being
introduced in Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   "Minorities seem to have a lot of difficulty dealing with
authority," one earnest reader wrote me. "Granted, there are some
minority people who are raised correctly," she went on, closing with
a comment about Rodney King. "I would have shot him the first time he
lunged ... "</TE>
<TE>   What happened in Inglewood wasn't racist, I told one reader from
the San Fernando Valley, but it was racial. The best way I could
explain it was to say that if a white person pulled into a gas
station in the Valley with a possibly lapsed registration, as
Jackson's father did in Inglewood, it's unlikely that six police
officers would arrive on the scene.</TE>
<TE>   I've been on ride-alongs with L.A. County sheriff's deputies, as
well as with cops in several cities, and I don't envy them. It's a
dangerous, thankless job. That they sometimes lose their cool is
understandable, but it's not acceptable, and the best of them have
written me to make that very point.</TE>
<TE>   On the ride-alongs in L.A. County, I saw deputies shine a light in
the face of every driver and every pedestrian in certain
neighborhoods, and I've seen them run license plates whether there
was an infraction or not. That doesn't happen in my neighborhood.
Does it happen in yours?</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood hits all the flash points. Race, economics,
stratification. It reminds us we're all imperfect, and that, wherever
we come from, we're not yet where we ought to be.</TE>

<HD>Huntington Tightens Up on Escort Firms</HD>
<DH>Law: Because some are fronts for prostitution and related
crimes have risen, all must register.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Concerned that prostitution through escort services in Huntington
Beach may be growing--and noting an increase in robberies and
assaults involving them--the City Council has passed an ordinance
requiring escort service operators and their employees to register
with police.</LD>
<LD>   Officials say that the number of arrests and crimes linked to
escort services is not high, but that the ordinance is a "preemptive
strike."</LD>
<LD>   "We're trying to prevent this business from becoming an industry
in our town,'' said Lt. Preston Linker, who heads the Police
Department's vice squad.</LD>
<TE>   Police recently arrested five women in three sting operations at
city hotels, and investigated four thefts or robberies and one rape
case linked with escort services.</TE>
<TE>   According to police, many of the companies and individuals
advertising in the personals sections of daily and weekly newspapers
are outright sex-for-hire operations.</TE>
<TE>   Some have also been linked to robberies and assaults and, in San
Clemente, two killings. Two engineers at the San Onofre nuclear power
plant were fatally beaten in separate incidents after calling an
escort service that operated out of Bellflower.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, clients call women who have placed "pleasure" ads in
the papers and arrange to meet, often at a hotel or motel room.</TE>
<TE>   After the woman arrives, she generally asks for the fee that was
agreed to over the phone, which police said averages about $200.</TE>
<TE>   The woman then leaves, saying she has to put the money in her car,
but does not return, said Linker.</TE>
<TE>   Often, the women are accompanied by male drivers who act as guards
but who also rob the clients, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The ordinance, which was approved July 1 and becomes effective
July 31, will require companies and individuals to secure permits
with the Police Department, and to pay fees ranging from $125 for
individuals to $500 for businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The applications entail background checks, inspections of
businesses, fingerprints and photos, giving police a clear idea of
who is doing business in the city.</TE>
<TE>   The ordinance "allows us to determine at the door if there's a
violation," Linker said. If they do business in the city and are not
registered, they are operating illegally, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Ron Lowenberg said the ordinance will be especially
helpful as the city attracts more conventions and visitors after the
new 500-room Hyatt on the waterfront opens in February.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that the new hotel increases the potential for more thefts
and robberies, he said he hopes the ordinance has a chilling effect
on phony escort services.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't come to Huntington Beach and say you're an escort service
[if] you're a front for prostitution, because we don't want it," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Quest Reaps a Glimpse of 1870s</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Ventura resident's search for information on
his great-grandfather leads to a publication that chronicles the
county's fertile farming heritage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Earl Hampton set out to do some genealogical research on his
great-grandfather a few years ago, he got a bit sidetracked.</LD>
<LD>   That is how he came to spend two years squinting at a microfilm
reader and transcribing half a New Testament's worth of old newspaper
articles that set out to chronicle every farm and every farmer in
Ventura County during the late 1870s.</LD>
<LD>   The result is a rare glimpse of day-to-day life at a time when the
county's population had exploded to 7,500, with settlers drawn from
far and wide by fertile land selling for a few dollars an acre. The
articles, written by unnamed reporters from Ventura's two weekly
newspapers of the era, have just been published in "Garden of the
World," a book-sized edition of the Ventura County Historical Society
quarterly.</LD>
<TE>   "It was such a spectacular effort," said Charles Johnson, the
publication's editor and the research librarian at the Ventura County
Museum of History and Art. "We're bringing to light a resource that
was completely forgotten."</TE>
<TE>   An 80-year-old retired petroleum engineer from Ventura, Hampton
was looking for clues as to why his great-grandfather, Charles G.
Finney Jr., had uprooted his family from Oshkosh, Wis., where he
practiced law and owned the local newspaper. What he found amounted
to an informal Ventura County census done a couple of years before
the first government census-takers set foot in the area.</TE>
<TE>   However, the reporters for the Ventura Signal and the Ventura Free
Press offered far more detail than any official tally, noting the
number of hogs slaughtered and sacks of barley shipped, the kinds of
grape on the vine, the "one special beauty of a Sicilian lemon tree"
on Abner Haines' place in Saticoy, the smell of the honeysuckle at
Mrs. C. Wooley's farmhouse off Hueneme Road.</TE>
<TE>   In 1878 and 1879, the reporters went by horseback or buggy into
the hinterlands. Each came back stuffed with chicken dinners and
laden with chest-thumping superlatives about the productive people
and beneficent climate of Ventura County, which had just been
established in 1873. The county's population had soared from less
than 1,000 in the 1860s, and progress meant attracting even more
people.</TE>
<TE>   The newspapers obliged. Claiming that it had avoided the
temptation to rhapsodize about the county's beauty, the Signal
boasted: "We firmly believe that if the truth can be told, just the
plain simple truth without any embellishment, we can offer to the
home seekers better inducements than any part of the whole country."</TE>
<TE>   Hunched over the microfilm reader in the cramped museum library,
Hampton was riveted. He volunteered to type the articles, word for
misspelled word, so they could be compiled for publication. The
project ultimately required seven proofreaders and $23,000 in
donations.</TE>
<TE>   "I put a lot of sweat into it," Hampton said, "but it was worth
it."</TE>
<TE>   Illustrated with period lithographs of Ventura County's finer
homes, the work delivers more than the vital statistics of roughly
500 farmers. The values of the day come through loud and clear.</TE>
<TE>   "If people only use the same thrift and economy they were obliged
to practice in the Atlantic states, their success is certain," the
Signal opined. "But if they fall into the loose, California style of
doing things, the consequences are doubtful."</TE>
<TE>   Jacob Maulhardt was a case in point. He had landed in Ventura
County a few years before "with a wife and three children and not a
cent in his pocket," the Signal said.</TE>
<TE>   However, the application of "a little pluck and well-directed
energy" soon brought him 450 acres, a barn with stalls for 38 horses
and a fine new $3,000 home--complete with dance floor and running
water.</TE>
<TE>   "A gentleman from the east sat down in the parlor the other day
and said, 'Maulhardt, this beats anything I ever expected to see in
California,' " the Signal reported.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1870s, Ventura County was undergoing its first great
land boom. Old forty-niners came down from played-out gold mines to
give farming a try. Immigrants from Great Britain, Germany, Ireland
and Italy, adventurers from New England and the Midwest, made their
way across the United States, riding into Ventura County in wagons.
Old-timers were the Mexican families from the era of the great
ranchos.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, citrus trees were a daring new crop. Fields of barley
and wheat rippled for miles. Hogs were a big moneymaker, along with
honey. The Schiappa Pietra brothers raised sheep, grew "every variety
of fruit known to this clime," and made what the Signal said was the
state's best wine--a vintage that sold for 50 cents a gallon.</TE>
<TE>   In the fashion of the day, the Signal reporter waxed lyrical. A
wooded farm in the Upper Ojai was positively mythic: "Here nature
revels in all her sweetest charms and might easily fancy the genie of
the forest playing with fauns and satyrs from the rippling streams
... "</TE>
<TE>   A scribe from the Free Press was a bit more down-to-earth. Treated
to dessert by a farmer named H. W. Olds, he wrote: "And here is to
the genuine cream--so often read of but so seldom seen--a mixture of
which with a dish of strawberries fresh from the vines was tendered
The Free Press representative and speedily taken care of by that
individual."</TE>
<TE>   Besides toiling over such passages, Hampton also helped scour
voting records, old histories and other sources for basic
biographical information on the farmers. He and Johnson managed to
sketch out a few details about more than half the people mentioned in
the newspapers' accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Some are stories in themselves: Known as a daring cowboy, Julio
Peralta was also described as "an excellent butcher of bear meat ...
who entertains the entire populace of Santa Paula with Fandangos and
is quite a sight coming into town straight as an arrow on his Bay
Gelding."</TE>
<TE>   But for all Hampton's effort, one fact eluded him.</TE>
<TE>   "I still have no idea," he said, "why my great-grandfather came to
Ventura County."</TE>

<HD>After Arm Surgery, Guitarist Ponders a Future He Can't Pick</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For that overwhelming percentage of us who work well within the
margins, it's tough to imagine being a virtuoso. Ballplayer,
cabinetmaker, scholar, musician ... what must it feel like to glide
above the crowd with a talent that soars?</LD>
<LD>   And then, just like that, to lose it? Or, more specifically, not
to lose it but to have it snatched away?</LD>
<LD>   Eric Henderson spends much of his time these days at his mother's
home in San Juan Capistrano, pondering such a twist of fate. Gone for
now are the trips to distant foreign capitals or American concert
halls, where he would perform classical guitar--sometimes in front of
great orchestras--to admiring crowds.</LD>
<TE>   Once upon a time, even the temporary loss of his great talent
would have left Henderson a wreck. It has, after all, been his life
since as a Laguna Beach teenager 30 years ago he studied in Madrid
with Andres Segovia.</TE>
<TE>   Now 44, Henderson can only hope he'll play again. But even if he
doesn't, he suggests he's learned to appreciate life outside the
concert hall.</TE>
<TE>   His epiphany began after performing a matinee concert April 21 in
San Diego. He didn't feel well afterward, but not until a second
hospital visit two days later did doctors diagnose that he had
necrotizing fasciitis--more commonly known as flesh-eating
disease--and said it might cost him his right arm.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea what I was in for," Henderson says now. "The last
thing I remember saying to the doctor before I went in to surgery
was, 'Don't take my arm.' "</TE>
<TE>   Besides dexterous fingers and strong hands, a virtuoso guitar
player must have strong arms. The arm was spared and, perhaps,
Henderson's playing career.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to get back doing concerts again, but it's going to be
awhile," he says in a halting, tired voice. "I can just last for a
few minutes now. I don't have a lot of endurance. My hand wasn't
affected, thank God, or my coordination. The problem, really, is in
the arm. It's numb from the shoulder down almost to my wrist."</TE>
<TE>   And during these idle, sometimes listless months of recovery has
come much thought.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, it's funny," he says. "When I did that San Diego
concert, I was at the top of my game. I felt the best I'd ever felt
as far as my technique, and everything was going well. I had plans
for lots of concerts. When this hit me afterward ... this has been a
life-changing experience for me. It is giving me such pause to look
at what is really important, how precious life really is. I've had to
stop and slow down and reflect and weigh things and thank God every
day for my arm, that I still have it, and that I have my life. The
things I took for granted I'm not taking for granted anymore."</TE>
<TE>   If he chooses, he could also reassess what friendship means.
Sometimes the exceptionally talented, already set apart from the
crowd, are lonelier than they realize. Henderson owns up to that,
saying practicing as much as 10 to 12 hours a day as a teen--
followed by an adult life spent largely on the road--produced
loneliness and a career that sometimes was "a real grind."</TE>
<TE>   "The pressure of performing, it would take a lot of the pleasure
of the music away from me," he says. "I always felt on the edge of
disaster, only as good as my last performance."</TE>
<TE>   On July 25, he might have a better sense of his place. Friends are
holding a benefit concert for him at seven-degrees, an arts and
events complex at 891 Laguna Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   The benefit is the brainchild of Nick Hernandez, a Laguna Beach
sculptor who has known Henderson since he was 12. Hernandez says the
benefit will start with dinner and drinks at 6 p.m. and feature local
bands, a silent auction and a raffle of artistic items. Proceeds will
help Henderson pay for some personal expenses, Hernandez says.</TE>
<TE>   I ask Hernandez why he's doing it. "Oh, geez," he says, "I've got
to tell you, his music, I'm in love with it. It's one of the few
things in life that is incredibly uplifting. It gives a richness and
value to life.... When I heard his arm might be amputated, I wept.
The thought of never hearing Eric play, when I've heard him from two
feet away--what a gift that is. It's like listening to angels."</TE>
<TE>   If he never plays the concert stage again, Henderson says, he'll
compose and teach a new generation of classical guitarists.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm overwhelmed that Nick has done this," Henderson says of the
benefit. "Just everybody that has stepped up and offered help. The
fact that they're doing this, it's humbling and kind of
overwhelming."</TE>

<HD>300 Protest Violence of Gangs in the Valley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 300 San Fernando Valley residents braved withering heat
Saturday to send a message to gang members: Don't mess with us.</LD>
<LD>   Moms pushing strollers and solemn-faced men in hats and sunglasses
were joined by skateboard-toting teenage boys and little girls in
sundresses as they paraded down Van Nuys Boulevard in Pacoima to
demand that Valley gangs end their violence.</LD>
<LD>   There's evidence that gang members are listening, participants and
organizers said.</LD>
<TE>   After a May 9 gang shooting in Panorama City killed a 3-year-old
boy and sparked community outrage, "the level of gang violence
throughout the Valley calmed down considerably," said Gilbert
Bautista, a Los Angeles County probation officer who attended the
march and is in charge of an anti-gang unit. "Even gang members often
have some kind of conscience."</TE>
<TE>   Jaime Peralta of Communities in Schools, a nonprofit gang
intervention group that sponsored the march with the help of area
churches, agreed. Since the May 9 slaying, gangs have been talking to
each other in an effort to reach a truce, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we have 15 gangs sitting at the table every Wednesday
night at a local church. There's not a peace treaty yet, but it's
gonna happen," Peralta said.</TE>
<TE>   As sign-waving marchers streamed out of the parking lot of Mary
Immaculate Church toward Ritchie Valens Recreation Center, dozens of
passing motorists honked their horns and shouted words of support.</TE>
<TE>   Marchers carried seven coffins representing lives recently lost to
gang violence.</TE>
<TE>   West Hills resident Rosemarie Marky said she traveled across the
Valley to join the march because she worries that gang members
interpret silence as indifference.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like teaching a child," she said. "If you never say 'no,'
how are they going to know? We need to tell these kids that what they
do here in the Valley affects all of us."</TE>

<HD>300 March to Protest Wave of Gang Violence in Valley</HD>
<DH>Activism: Participants carry seven coffins to represent
recent victims, including a 3-year-old.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>About 300 San Fernando Valley residents braved withering heat
Saturday to send a message to gang members: Don't mess with us.</LD>
<LD>   Moms pushing strollers and solemn-faced men in hats and sunglasses
were joined by skateboard-toting teenage boys and little girls in
sundresses as they paraded down Van Nuys Boulevard in Pacoima to
demand that Valley gangs end their violence.</LD>
<LD>   There's evidence that gang members are listening, participants and
organizers said.</LD>
<TE>   After a May 9 gang shooting in Panorama City killed a 3-year-old
boy and sparked community outrage, "the level of gang violence
throughout the Valley calmed down considerably," said Gilbert
Bautista, a Los Angeles County probation officer who attended the
march and heads an anti-gang unit. "Even gang members often have some
kind of conscience."</TE>
<TE>   Jaime Peralta of Communities in Schools, a nonprofit gang
intervention group that sponsored the march with the help of area
churches, agreed. Since the May 9 slaying, gangs have been talking to
each other in an effort to reach a truce, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we have 15 gangs sitting at the table every Wednesday
night at a local church. There's not a peace treaty yet, but it's
gonna happen," Peralta said.</TE>
<TE>   As marchers streamed out of the parking lot of Mary Immaculate
Church toward Ritchie Valens Recreation Center, dozens of passing
motorists honked their horns and shouted words of support.</TE>
<TE>   Marchers carried seven coffins representing lives recently lost to
gang violence.</TE>
<TE>   West Hills resident Rosemarie Marky said she traveled across the
Valley to join the march because she worries that gang members
interpret silence as indifference.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like teaching a child," she said. "If you never say 'no,'
how are they going to know? We need to tell these kids that what they
do here in the Valley affects all of us."</TE>
<TE>   Sonia Revoal of Sylmar agreed. "We're hoping there will be more of
this. Momentum builds on itself."</TE>
<TE>   At a rally before the march, Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, Los
Angeles County Board of Supervisors Chairman Zev Yaroslavsky and City
Council President Alex Padilla urged the crowd to continue being
vocal and visible.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the beginning. It's not the end. We're in the middle
of something [important]," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Denise Decker, a marcher from Van Nuys, said she believes strongly
that Saturday's event will send a message. "There's power in unity.
Everyone can change."</TE>

<HD>PUC Head Says Utilities May Get Power Surcharges</HD>
<DH>Electricity: Top official sees billions from rate hikes,
earmarked for future energy costs, going instead to buttress ailing
PG&amp;E and Edison.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>California's top utilities regulator has formally suggested that
billions of dollars in restricted money from last year's record
electricity rate hikes now might be used to help place the state's
largest investor-owned utilities on firm financial footing.</LD>
<LD>   Public Utilities Commission President Loretta M. Lynch
acknowledged that two surcharges adopted at the height of the energy
crisis had been earmarked for future power costs, not the debts the
utilities accrued in the runaway electricity market of 2000 and early
2001.</LD>
<LD>   But Lynch invited public comment this month on a proposal to
modify the use of money in light of subsequent legislation and
commission actions.</LD>
<TE>   "It may be appropriate to lift restrictions placed on the use of
surcharge revenues," she said in an assigned commissioner's ruling on
July 1. "One potentially just and reasonable use of surcharge
revenues, for example, might be for any purpose necessary to restore
financial health" to Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC is on record saying that it wants to use the money for a
court-approved settlement of a federal lawsuit by Edison and for the
commission's proposed plan to remove PG&amp;E from bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates who are fighting the PUC plans in court say
that Lynch is trying to strengthen the agency's legal position by
going through the motions of taking public comment and offering to
hold hearings.</TE>
<TE>   "This is shameless," said Michael Strumwasser, a Santa Monica
attorney who is appealing the Edison settlement for the Utility
Reform Network. "The PUC is already committed to the position Lynch
proposes."</TE>
<TE>   But, Lynch said, "I think it is an open question whether it is
appropriate" to use money from last year's rate increases to help the
utilities.</TE>
<TE>   She said the proposal is part of an effort to sort out the factual
and legal effects on the state deregulation law of commission
decisions and Assembly bills AB 1X, which authorized the state
Department of Water Resources to buy power and sell it to retail
customers, and AB 6X, which prohibited utilities from selling any
more generation facilities before 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Edison President Robert G. Foster said in a statement that the
utility supports Lynch's effort "to clarify its intent for the use of
revenues generated by the rate surcharges."</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E spokesman Ron Low said the company believes that the PUC
should use the surcharge revenue to help PG&amp;E.</TE>
<TE>   "As part of the settlement with Edison, the rules were changed to
allow them to recover their under-collected costs," Low said. "We
feel it is only appropriate to do that for the other utilities."</TE>
<TE>   Edison and PG&amp;E plunged into debt when frozen electricity rates
could no longer cover the costs of procuring electricity in the
deregulated wholesale market. The state began buying power for their
customers in mid-January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC stepped in and approved a rate increase of 1 cent per
kilowatt hour in January 2001 and a 3-cent increase in March 2001 to
cover the state's costs. PG&amp;E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection from creditors in April 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Now that wholesale prices have stabilized, the two utilities are
collecting hundreds of millions of dollars a month above their
electricity costs. And state regulators project that the companies
will bring in a total of $2.7 billion extra this year.</TE>
<TE>   That money is central to a fight that involves complex regulatory,
accounting and legal issues that will help determine how the cost of
the energy crisis will be borne.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC wants to make the utilities creditworthy to help get the
state out of the power-buying business.</TE>
<TE>   The utilities want to recoup energy crisis-related losses that
drove them to insolvency.</TE>
<TE>   And consumer groups want utility rate reductions and rebates of
the extra money collected by utilities over the past year.</TE>
<TE>   The Consumers Union, in a PUC filing, urged the commission to
reduce rates to the level needed to meet ongoing and future power
costs and to refund any extra money.</TE>
<TE>   "The PUC has no legal right to continue overcharging consumers
without first determining that these rates are reasonable and should
be paid by ratepayers," said Bill Ahern, a senior policy analyst with
the Consumers Union.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch said that rate relief should come in months, not years. But
she said the timing hinges on a variety of factors, including the
outcome of the Edison and PG&amp;E litigation; the state's own estimates
of next year's power purchase costs; and the tab of an upcoming bond
sale to replenish the state treasury for power procurement.</TE>
<TE>   "The big gorilla in the corner," Lynch said, is whether federal
regulators will extend wholesale electricity price caps that are
scheduled to expire this fall.</TE>
<TE>   If effective caps are not established, Lynch said, there is a
danger that wholesale prices again could skyrocket, so customer money
would have to be kept in reserve to pay the bills.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody has to provide electricity to the state," she said.
"It's going to be ratepayer or taxpayer dollars."</TE>
<TE>   On a separate front, state officials are asking the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission to approve billions of dollars in refunds for
consumers on grounds that energy companies gouged and gamed the
market.</TE>
<TE>   Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform Network,
said the PUC proposal for helping PG&amp;E and Edison amounts to dunning
customers for billions of dollars that the energy companies
improperly charged the utilities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like offering someone who already robbed your house a couple
of items they missed," Hoge said. "It's painfully clear that the
wholesale prices that caused the utilities' debts were the result of
illegal activity."</TE>

<HD>A Symbol of Everlasting Faith Keeps Rising Above Challenges</HD>
<DH>Worship: A thankful Baja patron and a renowned sculptor's
son persevere to build a 100-foot-tall Jesus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA RICHARDSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROSARITO BEACH, MEXICO</DL>
<LD>Just south of the main strip in this tourist town, where vendors sell
black clay vases from Oaxaca and ironmongers forge lacy beds and
candelabras, Jesus is rising. And the sight is stopping traffic.</LD>
<LD>   Up close, what appears to be emerging from the earth at roadside
is actually half a statue--a towering red-caped Jesus. The figure
ends at the chest. Its midsection lies nearby and the legs and feet
are not yet done.</LD>
<LD>   Even for a nation where religion and cultural identity are
intertwined, where homemade displays of faith dot the landscape, the
multi-story half-Jesus has become a phenomenon.</LD>
<TE>   Neither a civic project nor a church monument, the giant homage is
one man's life's mission, a work so all consuming that it has
enveloped the builder and another family and endured, despite
considerable challenges and a few deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Don Antonio Pequeno, the 75-year-old developer of the Villas San
Pedro housing development, calls the statue his folly, his
craziness--his locura.</TE>
<TE>   For years he and his oldest son, Pablo, talked of building a
statue of Jesus. At first, they envisioned something modest, to
demonstrate the family's devotion to God. But Pablo was killed in a
car accident several years ago and never got to see work on the Jesus
begin.</TE>
<TE>   At first, the statue took shape slowly, growing as Don Antonio's
real estate development prospered. Begun about 30 months ago, it will
one day stand 100 feet tall--about 25 feet taller than the statue of
Cristo Rey in Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   The two statues share a common bloodline.</TE>
<TE>   The one in Tijuana was designed by craftsman Virginio Ramirez. And
the ambitious Don Antonio decided that he would commission Ramirez to
design the even bigger Rosarito version. Ramirez, in turn, brought
along his two sons for the work.</TE>
<TE>   ("That one in Tijuana was just to practice for this one," Don
Antonio says.)</TE>
<TE>   When Virginio died last year after a long illness, and one son
unexpectedly followed him to the grave, the giant Christ figure lost
two of its principal craftsmen. But it instilled the surviving
Ramirez--Gregorio, 33--with a passion to finish the job.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez, looking into the statue's face, said the project "meant
everything" to his father.</TE>
<TE>   He feels the spirit of the master craftsman still there beside
him, pushing for completion of his last, best work. Monday through
Friday, the son works at the site. On Saturdays, he takes his
children, Edgar, 8 and Adrian, 2, to see it.</TE>
<TE>   Don Antonio's passion for the project remains intense as well,
nearly three years after the work began.</TE>
<TE>   With his success in business, he could be doing many other things.</TE>
<TE>   He began his adult life as a butcher, but bought land 30 years ago
just south of the town. At first, Villas San Pedro was almost
worthless, despite its sweeping ocean views.</TE>
<TE>   Then a population boom hit Rosarito Beach and the tourist town has
been growing ever since. Don Antonio is the owner of one of the most
sought-after housing development sites in the area.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that it's worth something," he said, "I take a little for my
statue."</TE>
<TE>   You wouldn't know the old man is a land baron to look at him.</TE>
<TE>   Beside the giant Christ figure, Don Antonio is simply dressed. He
could be one of the laborers at the site, rather than its owner. He
says little about the project--leery of seeming to court attention.</TE>
<TE>   What he will talk about is his abiding faith in God.</TE>
<TE>   "If I don't cling to God in times of trouble, who will I cling
to?" he said. "I have no mother any more, no father.... God is my
father."</TE>
<TE>   His young employee, Gregorio Ramirez, estimated the statue will
cost about $700,000 in all. But Don Antonio won't say.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't keep accounts with God," he said, shaking his head,
"because I don't want him to keep accounts with me."</TE>
<TE>   They have imported resin from Los Angeles, painters from
Guadalajara. When the colossus is complete--next March, they
hope--cranes will move it to a hilltop about half a mile south, where
a cross already waits.</TE>
<TE>   There, the giant Christ will be the tallest landmark on the
landscape. It will stand atop a small chapel. Don Antonio said his
tomb will be there one day, directly beneath the feet.</TE>
<TE>   He is aware that people of other faiths may not appreciate his
statue.</TE>
<TE>   "I respect all religions. If you believe in Buddha, that's fine
with me, I respect it too. But this is my expression of my faith.</TE>
<TE>   "I know people who say 'I don't believe in anything.' They are
their own god. And I know people who believe in money--that is their
king, their god." He shrugged. "Well, you have to believe in
something."</TE>
<TE>   While Don Antonio talked, Roberto Carmona, the owner of a small
hotel that caters to surfers across the highway, arrived to take
pictures. He stops by every few days with an instant camera to
document the progress.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen the one they have in Brazil, but this is prettier," he
said, gazing up. "Look at the face.... It's like he's ready to speak
to you."</TE>

<HD>Alice Stewart, 95; Studied Radiation Dangers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD PEARSON</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alice Stewart, a noted British physician and research epidemiologist
whose findings on the dangers of low-level radiation brought her
international acclaim and controversy, has died. She was 95.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart died June 23 in Oxford, England. The cause of death was
not reported.</LD>
<LD>   She devoted her professional life to issues of social medicine,
especially to studies warning of the danger of even low-level
radiation doses for such groups as pregnant women and nuclear
workers. Along the way, she took on the British and U.S. governments,
as well as the nuclear establishment.</LD>
<TE>   The author of more than 400 technical papers and a founder of the
British Journal of Industrial Medicine, Stewart always contended that
she was a scientist rather than an activist. Yet she became known for
her speeches to groups questioning nuclear policies, especially after
the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl incidents. In 1986, she received
the Right Livelihood Award, which is often called the alternative
Nobel Prize, for her contributions to society.</TE>
<TE>   She first gained headlines while at Oxford University in the
mid-1950s and working on the Oxford Child Health Surveys. The number
of childhood leukemia cases in Britain was skyrocketing, a phenomenon
Stewart attributed to the exposure of pregnant women to low-level
radiation doses from medical X-rays. At the time, X-rays were
commonly used by physicians to study the position of the fetus.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart's research showed that the children of women who had been
X-rayed were more than twice as likely to develop leukemia by age 10
than the children of women who had not been X-rayed while pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   Her findings raised a storm in the nuclear establishment,
including among physicians who saw opening horizons for nuclear
medicine to diagnose and treat myriad diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Others who were outraged included many in governments who had been
assuring their military forces and nuclear workers of the benign
effects of mild radiation.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart found funding for further studies hard to come by and
found government groups blocking her access to raw data for research.
Other studies backed her conclusions, though, and by the 1970s,
prenatal X-rays had largely been stopped.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes were dramatically raised in the mid-1970s when Stewart
was invited to become a consultant to a federal study into the
effects of low-level radiation on workers at the historic nuclear
plant in Hanford, Wash. It was a huge government facility remembered
as the source of plutonium used in World War II atomic bombs.</TE>
<TE>   The Hanford Survey was the largest study of its kind into the
long-term health of nuclear workers. Stewart's initial findings
indicated that workers at Hanford were 10 times more likely to
develop cancer later in life than was commonly believed.</TE>
<TE>   The study was not published by the government, and Stewart
published work based on her data and on material submitted to her.</TE>
<TE>   Alice Mary Naish was born in Sheffield, England, to parents who
were both physicians. She received her medical degree from Cambridge
University, and during World War II she conducted acclaimed studies
on the health risks of factory workers and miners.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart joined Oxford University's School of Social Medicine. She
taught and did research until 1974. She then became a senior research
fellow in Birmingham University's Social Medicine Department. She
retired about two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Her marriage to Ludovick Stewart ended in divorce.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include a daughter, also a physician, and four
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Working to Revive a Revival Church</HD>
<DH>Religion: Angelus Temple renovation is done, and pastor has
high hopes for future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The house that Pentecostal revivalist Aimee Semple McPherson built
will reopen its main auditorium today after a $7-million renovation
to modernize the aging, historic facility. And to hear church
officials tell it, she would be happy at how her Angelus Temple has
been improved.</LD>
<LD>   "I think she would be excited by all this," said pastor Matthew
Barnett, who took over stewardship of the landmark Echo Park church
in October.</LD>
<LD>   The refurbished auditorium will be formally opened at a 10 a.m.
service, which officials say will herald a new day for the church, a
fixture on the Los Angeles landscape since it was founded in 1923.</LD>
<TE>   Among the improvements are new seats for most of the 3,200-seat
auditorium, although the original wooden seats remain in the upper
level. The renovation also includes acoustical tile hanging from the
temple's dome to improve the sound; a new audiovisual system that can
accommodate theatrical events and concerts; and air-conditioning.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials said that key elements of the rehabilitation are
the preservation of the historic dome, the stained-glass windows and
a 40-foot mural of Jesus Christ.</TE>
<TE>   Within a few months, they said, the pipe organ, which was removed,
will be restored for use at services.</TE>
<TE>   The church's condition and the dwindling number of congregants
have brought controversy in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Almost four years ago, Ed and Ivy Stanton came from Portland,
Ore., to become Angelus Temple's new pastors. They intended to turn
the struggling church around, with a contemporary approach to attract
younger followers. They also wanted to remodel the church, which had
been named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   They closed the auditorium and moved most of the services to a
hotel in Pasadena. Some services were held in an adjacent 1,000-seat
room in the church's old Bible college.</TE>
<TE>   The couple planned to build a flat ceiling to cover the temple's
dome and obscure the mural, and to rip out the old organ. Longtime
followers called the proposals an insult to McPherson's legacy.</TE>
<TE>   A divorcee from Canada, McPherson was one of the early 20th
century's most successful evangelists. She preached dramatically,
often using Hollywood stage props and movie-star flamboyance to draw
thousands to her temple at Glendale Boulevard and Park Avenue, across
the street from Echo Park Lake.</TE>
<TE>   During the Depression, she was seen by many as a beacon of hope in
an otherwise cruel and desperate world.</TE>
<TE>   In October, the Stantons stepped down as pastors and were replaced
by Barnett, an energetic 28-year-old who had founded the Los Angeles
International Center, also known as the Dream Center. That church
operates a treatment center for drug addicts, provides a home for
ex-convicts and works with children threatened by street gangs.</TE>
<TE>   The center, at the old Queen of Angels Hospital site off the
Hollywood Freeway in Echo Park, has impressed many in religious
circles with its growth.</TE>
<TE>   The renovations at Angelus started shortly after Barnett's
arrival. Barnett and others say the growth of the Dream Center--which
merged with Angelus Temple when Barnett was appointed to
Angelus--could renew interest in the Foursquare denomination and its
flagship facility.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel that Angelus Temple can be symbolic of bringing
communities together," he said. "It can bring the sense that
something big is going on there. The inner city deserves the very
best."</TE>
<TE>   By coincidence, the reopening of the temple auditorium today will
coincide with the annual Lotus Festival at Echo Park Lake, which
marks the community's biggest weekend of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Associate Pastor Aaron Jayne said parking may be at a premium as
crowds descend on Echo Park. "The festival folks are letting us use
some of their parking," Jayne said.</TE>

<HD>100-Year-Old Aquatic Champ Still Making a Splash</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CECILIA RASMUSSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She's supremely confident, strikingly beautiful--and the oldest
American competitive diver who still takes the plunge, more than 80
years after she first took to the water.</LD>
<LD>   Viola Cady Krahn's fearless half-twist dives still sparkle as much
as the medals and trophies she won eight decades ago, as a
21-year-old swimming and diving champ, a star in an emerging
California beach culture.</LD>
<LD>   Now 100 years old, she can still tell of standing on the shoulders
of the undisputed king of surfers, Duke Kahanamoku, as he rode the
waves of Laguna Beach, not far from Krahn's present home in Leisure
World.</LD>
<TE>   She was the leader of a team of swimmers that first made it from
Long Beach to Catalina. But, in spite of her many swimming and diving
titles, she never made it to the 1924 Olympics with prospective
teammates such as Johnny Weismuller and Kahanamoku: Her new husband
was afraid she'd fall in love with one of them and didn't want her to
go.</TE>
<TE>   In 1919, with the Roaring '20s just around the corner, 18-year-old
Viola Hartmann was ready to bust loose. While vacationing in Long
Beach from her home in Arizona, she honed her swimming skills and
finally swam out to the battleship Vermont, anchored more than a mile
offshore. Plucked like a fish from the sea by the surprised crew, she
was bundled up by sailors who rowed her ashore and asked for her
phone number.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, still feeling the tug of the Pacific, she left
the heat of landlocked Arizona behind and headed back to Los Angeles
to pursue a swimming career. She joined the Los Angeles Athletic
Club, where her prowess caught the eye of Fred Cady, who coached
swimming and diving to a gold mine's worth of Olympic and potential
Olympic athletes, including Kahanamoku, Weismuller, Buster Crabbe,
Georgia Coleman and Mickey Riley.</TE>
<TE>   With Cady's help, Krahn won junior national diving championships
in 1922, '23 and '24. In 1922, at an exhibition swim meet between the
L.A. and Venice athletic clubs, she won the 220-meter race in 2
minutes and 6 seconds. "This was the fastest time a female had
covered the distance in the club pool," wrote Krahn's niece, Margery
Voyer Cole, in her book "Viola, Diving Wonder and Aquatic Champion."</TE>
<TE>   The intricacies of diving, the strength and balance it required,
paled in comparison with her next challenge: riding endless waves
while standing on the shoulders of Kahanamoku in 1922, at an event
widely covered by the press.</TE>
<TE>   It may have been one of her most valuable maneuvers, because it
prompted Cady, the coach, to begin courting the young swimmer. Cady,
a sculptor, artist and former strong man for Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus,
nearly 20 years her senior, muscled his way to a victory by marrying
her in 1923.</TE>
<TE>   Marriage did not deter her winning more swimming and diving
medals, and she was a strong favorite for the 1924 U.S. swim team in
the Paris Olympics. But her new husband never entered her name. "He
feared I'd fall in love with someone else," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She stopped competing and hunkered down to being a housewife.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though I never had children, I still believed the woman took
care of the household. But if I had to do it again, I'd go to every
swim meet with Cady, put my two cents in and probably get into
trouble," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But her retirement was short-lived. In 1926, the year after Cady
was named USC's head swimming and diving coach, she was back in the
limelight.</TE>
<TE>   Looking for a way to lure tourists to Catalina, chewing-gum
magnate William Wrigley Jr., who owned the island, offered $25,000 to
amateur swimmers who could swim the 21-mile channel. To test whether
this was possible, the Los Angeles Athletic Club and the Pacific
Coast Club of Long Beach asked Cady to organize a relay team of more
than a dozen long-distance champion professional swimmers, including
his wife, who would lead the team.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 9, 1926, cameras clicked as Krahn waded into the
67-degree Long Beach surf and began swimming the first mile and a
half leg of the grueling swim that would eventually become the
granddaddy of ocean events in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't easy," Krahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, she gutted it out more than a mile at a time,
battling deep currents and choppy waves. She swallowed ocean water,
which left her vomiting. "But my leg cramps were the worst," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband monitored the team in a rowboat, while a yacht kept
the group on a fairly straight course and offered support and rest
for the exhausted swimmers.</TE>
<TE>   And 23 hours and 27 minutes later, Krahn and her teammates emerged
near Avalon, proving the swim could be done. Cady, acknowledging the
difficulties, told the press: "It will take swimmers, husky and
muscular, who trained in icy-cold waters for months" to make it
across the channel.</TE>
<TE>   A few months later, before Charles Lindbergh flew solo across the
Atlantic, a 17-year-old Canadian, George Young, made the exhausting
solo swim and won the $25,000 prize.</TE>
<TE>   Cady and his wife watched as 102 swimmers started the competition
for the big prize, to which another $15,000 had been added in case a
woman finished the swim. One contestant, heavily greased in beef
suet, donned three pairs of long, woolen undersuits tied at the
ankles with ropes. "When the gun sounded for the beginning of the
race, he sank like a stone," the press reported.</TE>
<TE>   (Since 1927, when the Catalina Channel Swimming Federation began
monitoring such attempts, about 100 people have completed the swim.)</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Krahn continued to "keep the home fires burning"
while Cady traveled and coached at five Olympics and taught a long
list of celebrity clients how to swim and dive, among them actors
Harold Lloyd and Errol Flynn, and tobacco heiress Doris Duke.</TE>
<TE>   In 1941, Duke, "the richest girl in the world," arrived at the
Santa Barbara Biltmore Hotel to train under Cady. Weeks later she
returned to Shangri-La, her Moroccan-themed winter retreat in Hawaii,
with Cady and Flynn in tow. Duke had a hydraulic lift installed above
her pool as a diving platform, so she could show off her diving skill
to her guests.</TE>
<TE>   Cady coached until 1958 at USC and died two years later. He was
posthumously inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame;
his wife has not been so honored.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1960s, Krahn moved from her Sherman Oaks home to
Leisure World to be near the ocean again. There, she met and married
her second husband, Fred Krahn. They were married in 1970 and he died
in 1986. Through his support, she returned to diving in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Krahn has kept her 5-foot, 6-inch body in peak shape to compete in
the U.S. Masters Division; she's the only competitor in the
100-or-older ranks in the 1-meter and 3-meter springboard events one
step below Olympic level.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's fun to try to win. I just have to remember to keep
my buns up," she said with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   Many of Krahn's trophies and mementos, which span 80 years, are
displayed in her home, from huge trophies to a medal small enough to
fit into the palm of her hand. Among her collection is a medal won by
Kahanamoku, and the 1928 Olympic silver medal won by Georgia Coleman,
who bequeathed it to her friend. Krahn would have more, but she often
gives away her medals to the champion swimmers at the Special
Olympics for handicapped children.</TE>
<TE>   Although Krahn gave up her driver's license this year, she can
still be a caution on the golf course, with a recent 14 handicap. She
throws in a little tennis and horseback riding now and then, and
attributes her longevity to good genes--and perhaps, she says, good
Scotch. With water, of course.</TE>

<HD>New Profs Aid UCI's Ascent of Ivory Tower</HD>
<DH>Education: University has aggressively recruited top-tier
scholars in reaching to rival such schools as UCLA and UC Berkeley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Offering big salaries, research money and fancy titles--along with
the opportunity to build new programs--UC Irvine has recruited
several high-profile professors for the coming school year.</LD>
<LD>   The headhunting is part of an effort by UCI administrators to
boost the university into the highest echelon of academia.</LD>
<LD>   The new professors come from a variety of fields--including
history, psychology, genetics and mechanical engineering--and from
such schools as UCLA, New York University and Emory University in
Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   "Irvine is now using the tactics very aggressively that perhaps
are more quietly used by institutions ... [that] have less of a
competitive problem in recruiting faculty," said David Ward,
president of the American Council on Education and former chancellor
of the University of Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   Although about two-thirds of UCI's new appointments are
bright-light junior faculty members fighting their way up the tenure
track, the senior academics who accepted offers are expected to
attract other professors, grants and attention to the university.</TE>
<TE>   Among the new hires are Elizabeth Loftus, whom the Review of
General Psychology ranked 58th on its list of the 100 top
psychologists of the 20th century; the exiled Kenyan author Ngugi wa
Thiong'o, considered one of the greatest living African writers; and
Southern California historian and social critic Mike Davis, author of
the best-selling "City of Quartz" and recipient of a MacArthur
Foundation award.</TE>
<TE>   All three will hold the title of "distinguished professor," a
designation given to only a few.</TE>
<TE>   Other newcomers include Satya Atluri, a theoretical mechanical
engineer from UCLA, also a distinguished professor, and Doug Wallace,
a geneticist and member of the National Academy of Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   It's Growing Time</TE>
<TE>   As 37-year-old UCI grows into middle age, faculty and
administrators are pushing hard to establish a reputation comparable
to that of UCLA and UC Berkeley. They are being helped by the planned
growth of the student body by about 50%, to 30,000, within the next
decade. Such a sharp increase brings the opportunity to hire about
400 professors, including those replacing retirees, said Herb
Killackey, the executive associate vice chancellor.</TE>
<TE>   It is also a time of extensive campus construction. Six science
and engineering buildings are planned or under construction, at a
total cost of about $200 million, said William Parker, UCI's vice
chancellor for research.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of the features we have in recruiting senior faculty,"
he said. "We're a growing institution and they have the opportunity
to shape a new program."</TE>
<TE>   For example, Wallace, the newly hired geneticist, will have a
joint appointment in the schools of biological sciences and medicine
and will move into an entire floor of Hewitt Hall when it is
completed in six months. He will bring with him from Emory about 25
people who make up his research team, including doctoral and
post-doctoral students, technical assistants and support staff,
Parker said.</TE>
<TE>   Established professors may come to UCI for recognition, the chance
to build new programs or colleagues they'd like to work with.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not sufficiently well-funded to provide the best financial
package," Parker said. "We want to be competitive with salaries,
space and research support. But what attracts people are the building
opportunities that come with a growing university or a specific set
of colleagues here."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the time, schools engaged in academic arms races don't
give up easily. For example, New York University's faculty engaged in
a campaign to entice Ngugi to stay, and the university offered him
loads of additional resources, said Karen Lawrence, UCI's dean of
humanities.</TE>
<TE>   Special Status to Confer</TE>
<TE>   UCI put a special effort into hiring Loftus, Ngugi and Atluri.
Early last year, nominations were solicited from faculty for
professors elsewhere who could be appointed distinguished UCI
professors. A committee narrowed the list to seven.</TE>
<TE>   A social scientist and a computer scientist turned down the
offers, Killackey said, and the negotiating dance continues with two
others.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd say the [success] rate was a little higher than we expected,"
Killackey said.</TE>
<TE>   Ngugi, 64, a novelist, essayist and playwright, said he left NYU
for the chance to become the first director of UCI's International
Center for Writing and Translation. "I love New York. I love NYU. But
I felt that the challenge of the new center and chance to develop
that type of model was too important for me not to take it."</TE>
<TE>   Amnesty International adopted Ngugi as a prisoner of conscience
after the Kenyan government jailed him. He has been in exile since
1982.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a major coup for UCI," said Francoise Lionnet, chairwoman
of French and Francophone studies at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence called Ngugi's hiring "huge. It will lend immediate
visibility to our new center."</TE>
<TE>   Loftus accepted the offer from UCI June 30 in psychology and
crime, law and society. She had spent 29 years at the University of
Washington in Seattle, but a dispute with the administration left her
angry and ripe for an offer.</TE>
<TE>   Loftus said she decided to take UCI's offer because of its
concentration of professors at the intersection of psychology and
law.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Davis is a historian known for his bestsellers and articles

<HD>Chancellor's Fate Delicate Issue for Board</HD>
<DH>Colleges: Ventura County trustees, under pressure to oust
him, may risk their own political futures. Three are up for
reelection and one is subject to recall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS and MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the five elected trustees of the Ventura County Community
College District meet Tuesday to decide the fate of embattled
Chancellor Philip Westin, they may also be setting the course for
their own political futures.</LD>
<LD>   With a majority of board members facing reelection in November and
one targeted for recall, their closed-door evaluation of Westin's
performance as head of the 31,000-student district is sure to be
politically charged, experts say.</LD>
<LD>   The trustees are under increasing pressure to take action against
Westin, who is fighting to hold onto his job after revelations that
he submitted more than $119,000 in business-related expenses from
1997 to 2001.</LD>
<TE>   But the board's decision won't be an easy one, because it shares
responsibility as the public's watchdog for financial abuses, critics
say. With full knowledge of Westin's spending, the board voted 4 to 1
in May to award the chancellor a new four-year contract, a $30,000
pay raise and a $1,500-a-month car allowance. Trustee John Tallman, a
longtime Westin critic, dissented.</TE>
<TE>   In June, at the district's expense, Westin took out a $6,000,
full-page advertisement in a local newspaper defending himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Without exception, Chancellor Westin's expenditures fully
complied with law, board policy and his employment contract with the
district," the ad states.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the trustees' decision over Westin's future is complicated
because it appears that he did not violate district policy, which
places no limits on his spending and provides little oversight. An
audit also cleared him of criminal wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the chancellor has said repeatedly he will not
resign.</TE>
<TE>   "These weren't the kind of mistakes you fire somebody for," Westin
said. "It's not a hanging offense."</TE>
<TE>   But Westin's spending habits and the board's failure to control
them over his six-year tenure have sparked public outrage, fueled in
part by the daily barrage of headlines over major financial
scandals--from the collapse of Enron to WorldCom, said Herbert Gooch,
chairman of the political science department at Cal Lutheran
University in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's supposed to be the board that's keeping watch on these
issues," Gooch said. "You have these national villains, and now you
have the local embodiment of it. It taps into an anger that could
carry over into the fall, when people could vote with their feet."</TE>
<TE>   Pressure to oust Westin heated up when it was disclosed that
trustees renewed his contract, even after learning of his spending
practices.</TE>
<TE>   Board Vice President Art Hernandez, who now says he will call for
Westin's resignation, was on a subcommittee that recommended the
chancellor receive a pay raise and an automobile stipend as part of
his new contract. Hernandez and other board members said they did not
authorize Westin's newspaper advertisement.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, Tallman and board President Norman Nagel are up for
reelection this year. Trustee Allan Jacobs, whose term expires in
2004, is the subject of a recall effort by the conservative Ventura
County Republican Assembly, which has ties to state Sen. Tom
McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks).</TE>
<TE>   Assembly leaders say they do not know enough about trustee Bob
Gonzales, the Santa Paula police chief, to start a recall against
him, but critics say a chief aide to McClintock served as Gonzales'
campaign manager. Gonzales has declined to discuss Westin's future
before Tuesday's board meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Nagel and Jacobs remain firmly committed in their support of the
chancellor.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at everything that's been done in the district
under his leadership, it's been extremely positive," Nagel said. "Are
you going to take this blemish and destroy everything else? That's
not something I want to do."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, community activists Hank Lacayo and David Maron have
started an e-mail campaign to oust Westin. But others say the
trustees also bear responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "People are saying if [the trustees] have any political ambitions,
they'd better do something," said Don Facciano, president of the
Ventura County Taxpayers Assn. "They're getting a lot of pressure.
They could be looking for a scapegoat, to fire Westin and say, 'We
did our job and now everything's wonderful again.' I hope the
trustees will make their decision based not on political expediency
or whether they'll be recalled, but on facts."</TE>
<TE>   The board first learned about the extent of Westin's spending in
March when the Camarillo-based law firm of Wood &amp; Bender presented
trustees with a detailed report of his expense records. The report
found more than $119,000 in overall expenses from 1997 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Of those, $46,000 were listed as questionable, essentially lacking
receipts or adequate documentation. Included were $22,300 for car
repairs, $12,700 for equipment and supplies, $7,600 for computer
software, $1,600 for travel upgrades and $1,700 for miscellaneous.</TE>
<TE>   In a complaint filed with the State Bar of California, Westin
accused one of the firm's partners, David Bender, of conducting the
financial study in an attempt to oust him because he had declined to
steer legal work to Bender's firm.</TE>
<TE>   Bender has declined to comment. But his partner, David Wood, has
said the attorneys did nothing improper. The law firm is engaged in a
dispute with the college district over payment for its study of
Westin's expenditures. District officials say they did not authorize
the study.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the trustees were alarmed by the report's findings
and initially sought Westin's resignation. But they quickly dropped
the effort after an auditor hired by the district cleared him of
criminal wrongdoing. Shortly afterward, Westin's contract was
extended.</TE>
<TE>   Board members defended their action, saying the pay increase put
Westin's salary more in line with that of chancellors from
similar-sized districts and that his new contract helped ensure that
financing for a recent voter-approved bond measure would not be
affected.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Westin has set voluntary limits on his meal expenses,
and trustees have vowed to monitor him more closely until they adopt
a formal spending policy. But while a majority of trustees have stood
behind him, their resolve appears to be cracking.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez said that he acted hastily when he cast his vote in May
and said the board should reconsider its decision. Tallman has said
he would like trustees to authorize a more detailed audit of Westin's
expenditures since he became chancellor in 1996.</TE>

<LD>Under fire over charges of excessive spending, Community College
District Chancellor Philip Westin is battling to keep his job.
Trustees are expected to decide his fate at a special closed-door
meeting Tuesday. The following are excerpts from an interview Westin
had with The Times last week.</LD>
<LD>   Question: Will you resign if asked?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Absolutely not. We have a lot of work ahead of us in this
district. We have a new bond that's been passed. We have some
extremely important issues facing us. And I believe it's critical
that the leadership team continue to work with the faculty, staff and
managers as well as the board of trustees and community to put these
things in place.</LD>
<TE>   Q: Do you believe you have the confidence of the public and a
majority of the trustees to lead this district?</TE>
<TE>   A: I believe I have the confidence of the trustees. I believe the
confidence of some parts of the public has been shaken, but I have
had many people reach out to me. That gives me a strong belief that
the vocal minority may be being heard, but I believe that the large
majority of the public is fully interested in working with me.</TE>
<TE>   Q: According to the district's own records, you were reimbursed
for more than $119,000 in business-related expenses from 1997 to
2001. Do you think your spending has been excessive?</TE>
<TE>   A: If you talk about the things that were purchased, computer
software and that sort of thing, it was for district business. It was
an actual and necessary business expense. In terms of the meals, I
think that a limit on meals is appropriate, and I think limits and
restrictions on who meals are purchased for is appropriate. On the
other hand I do believe it is important and appropriate to have
business meals and business travel as part of my job.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you understand why the public is outraged?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yeah, I think I understand why they are outraged. It is a large
number of dollars over what I believe was a four-year term. People
see that and react to that, which is OK, although I'm not sure that
people have necessarily taken the time to think through what are the
appropriate costs for any person who is in a position similar to
mine.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Should the chancellor be allowed to police his own spending?</TE>
<TE>   A: Hindsight is 20/20. Certainly the answer to that question, in
light of the last few weeks, is no. There would probably be much less
outrage if these things had gone to the board directly.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Have you ever violated the board's or district's policies in
any way?</TE>
<TE>   A: No, not to my knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You said that the $356-million bond measure approved by county
voters in March is the most important thing that has ever happened in
the district's history. Do you think voters would have approved that
bond measure if they had known about your spending practices?</TE>
<TE>   A: I believe the answer is yes. The bond passed with a two-thirds
vote. What we found prior to the measure being put on the ballot is
that the colleges have positively affected many of the citizens who
live in this county. I believe that the two-thirds vote reflected
that. They weren't voting for any one college or for me or for any
board member. They were voting for the future of the students in this
county.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you think you deserve a $30,000 pay raise?</TE>
<TE>   A: The studies that we did would indicate that my salary level is
somewhat above the middle for people who are chancellors of
multi-college districts when looking at their total compensation. If
I were not here, I believe this board would pay at least that or more
in order to attract and retain someone in this position.</TE>
<TE>   Q: If you were allowed to attend the board's closed-door meeting
on Tuesday where they are expected to decide your future, what would
you tell them?</TE>
<TE>   A: First of all, I would tell them very sincerely that their
leadership for this district has been superb. I would tell them that
I believe that I made some mistakes but I have never purported to be
anything but human. I do believe that if we want to work together
that the colleges and the community would benefit with my continuing
to lead this district.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you think you can get a fair hearing with a board that
includes three members up for reelection and one up for recall?</TE>
<TE>   A: Absolutely. I know each of these gentlemen on a professional
level. They are thoroughly committed and have always demonstrated
their ability to work together, even when they have disagreements,
for the common goal of serving students.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What have you learned from this experience?</TE>
<TE>   A: I've learned humility, pain. I've learned a lot about pain.
I've relearned how important it is to be honest with myself and my
family. I've learned that although there are critics, there are also
people who are kind and are supportive and caring.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You have suggested in the past that if you are fired or forced
to resign, you might sue the district. Is that still the case?</TE>
<TE>   A: First of all, I would hope that I won't have to go there,
because, to the best of my knowledge and conscience, there is no
cause. On the other hand, I have a mortgage and a family and a
four-year contract. I haven't really allowed myself to put all of
those things together in terms of directly answering that question,
because it is my belief that it won't go there.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Would you consider some type of buyout?</TE>
<TE>   A: I would be willing to talk about it. Certainly if the board
believes that it is time for me to go, as a practical matter, it
would be better for us to have that conversation than raising the
specter of a lawsuit, for instance, or termination without cause. So
I guess the critical question is: Does the board still want me here?</TE>

<HD>4 Family Members Found Stabbed to Death in Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ and ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A family of four--a wife, a husband, their 8-year-old daughter and
his grandmother--were found stabbed to death Saturday morning in
their South Whittier home, a crime scene that investigators said
offered few signs of a motive.</LD>
<LD>   Miguel Ruiz, 37, his wife, Maritza Trejo, 41, their daughter,
Jasmine, and Ruiz's grandmother, Anna Martinez, in her 70s, were
known as a quiet, hard-working family involved in computer and audio
equipment sales and repair, neighbors said.</LD>
<LD>   Ruiz was last heard from about 9 p.m. Thursday, said Lt. Ray Peavy
of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's homicide bureau. A
neighbor, however, told detectives that she had seen Martinez early
Friday morning.</LD>
<TE>   The bodies were found in separate rooms and the house had been
ransacked, with walls and ceilings damaged, furniture overturned and
drawers emptied, authorities said. Investigators said they believed
more than one person may have been involved in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   A computer was found in a neighbor's backyard, and family members
told authorities that computer equipment was missing from the home.</TE>
<TE>   No evidence of forced entry was found, detectives said. The murder
weapon, which had not been found, was a knife or other cutting
instrument, they said. Also, no one in the neighborhood had reported
unusual sounds, including barking by the family's two dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's possible they knew the person, or it could be as simple as
someone coming to the door and being allowed in. I don't know," Peavy
said, adding that the family had not been involved in "anything out
of the ordinary" and that Ruiz had no criminal background.</TE>
<TE>   Trejo's 21-year-old daughter tried to visit the family Friday
night, but when no one answered the door she didn't think enough of
it to become concerned and spent the night with an aunt, Peavy said.
On Saturday morning, the two returned to discover the bodies in the
house in the 10200 block of Gunn Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   "My entire family has just been stabbed to death--my brother, my
grandma, my baby niece, my sister-in-law," Olga Ruiz, Miguel's
sister, said as she loaded the family's two dogs into her sport
utility vehicle, stopping to hug neighbors who cried in her arms.
"Police have only told us that it is under investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Peavy, an 11-year veteran of the homicide bureau, said: "It is a
very, very, brutal, brutal murder.... I've never seen anything like
it. We just don't have a clue as to what has occurred at this
time.... It's just baffling."</TE>
<TE>   Peavy said he was convinced that "this is a quadruple homicide.
There is not a doubt in my mind about that." He added that the
killings were "absolutely not a murder-suicide."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators interviewed family members Saturday at a nearby
sheriff's substation.</TE>
<TE>   Late Saturday night, coroner's investigators were at the
one-story, tan stucco house, which had icicle Christmas lights still
hanging on it. Throughout the day, neighbors huddled on their porches
in disbelief, some weeping and explaining to their children about the
unfolding tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   "I just straight-out told my daughter that the family had died,"
said Maria Cervantes, who lives next door and whose daughter attended
school with Jasmine. "She was crushed this morning, and I just had to
explain what tragedy means."</TE>
<TE>   A silver minivan parked in the Ruizes' driveway sported a sticker
from a nearby tattoo parlor, Electric Pencil, which is owned by
Ruiz's friend, Mike Gutierrez, who last talked to his friend of nine
years about 9 p.m. Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz worked two jobs, one as a stereo technician at Sound City in
Maywood, and the other fixing computers in his home office, Gutierrez
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz's wife also worked in the electronics business, selling audio
equipment at a Pomona swap meet, often putting in long hours,
sometimes six or seven days a week, neighbors said.</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez said he and Ruiz would typically chat a few times a day,
with Ruiz often talking about how he had conquered his latest
computer repair challenge</TE>
<TE>   "It made his day when he was able to fix it," Gutierrez said. "He
saw the relief in their [customers'] faces when he brought the
computers back to life. He was like my mentor. I'm sure going to miss
them [the family]. I'm just flabbergasted, I'm having a hard time
understanding it."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said Ruiz worked flexible hours so he could care for his
grandmother, who had suffered a stroke, and take Jasmine to school.
"He was always there for his daughter, like a Mr. Mom," said neighbor
Lupe Rivera, 27.</TE>
<TE>   Jasmine attended a second- and third-grade combination class at
nearby McKibben Elementary School, and had been named student of the
month several times.</TE>
<TE>   Jasmine liked handball and soccer, and enjoyed roller skating
nearly every day, neighbors said.</TE>
<TE>   "She was like my own daughter," said neighbor Maria Cervantes, 33.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Cara Mia DiMassa and Michael Krikorian
contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>If ever comic relief lived up to its name, it was June 10, when a
Jewish and a Muslim comedian, Rabbi Bob Alper and Egyptian-born Ahmed
Ahmed, appeared together at Temple Beth El in Aliso Viejo.</LD>
<LD>   Although the crowd of some 300 was mostly Jewish, there were
Muslims and Christians there too. It was an evening of interfaith
warmth and humor that makes us believe U.S. Jews, Christians and
Muslims could be doing more to promote Middle East peace.</LD>
<LD>   As U.S. Christians, Jews and Muslims--whose common ancestor is
Abraham--we pray each day to the same God to protect innocent
Israelis and Palestinians and for the day when all Middle East people
will live in peace and security.</LD>
<TE>   Our collective thoughts dwell on their painful situation. We mourn
the losses of their loved ones.</TE>
<TE>   We offer our sympathy and we empathize with their anguish and
despair.</TE>
<TE>   We use our financial means, political influence, technological
know-how and even our persuasive rhetoric to lend support and
solidarity for their causes.</TE>
<TE>   Yet we have failed to share adequately with Israelis and
Palestinians the most important and valuable characteristic we take
for granted living in America--the ability of people of our three
faiths to live together in peace.</TE>
<TE>   Christians, Jews and Muslims live and work side by side in the
United States in harmony and toward our nation's prosperity. Even as
we espouse our divergent points of view, we respect one another and,
through interfaith dialogues and community efforts, work to
appreciate our similarities and mutual values.</TE>
<TE>   Our frustrations and conflicting stances are tempered with the
maturity of our compassion and support for one another, and we
continue to instill in our children the importance of honoring all
people, regardless of color, race or religion.</TE>
<TE>   But we have not shared with the people of the Middle East this
beautiful characteristic that is based on tolerance and mutual
respect.</TE>
<TE>   We export money and arms, we offer solidarity and even
condemnations, but we have not sufficiently conveyed our democratic
values or our humanity.</TE>
<TE>   We must offer the people of the Middle East a vision of our
society, where Christians, Jews and Muslims live in peace and
security and do not let their differences result in the indignity of
oppression and occupation or the bloodshed of innocent civilians.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Jews must simultaneously support Israel's right to live a
terror-free existence while convincing that nation's leaders that the
siege of Palestine and the building of settlements produce more
suicide attacks and lessen Israel's credibility.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Muslims must support the right of Palestinians to their land
and to their own state, while convincing them that suicide attacks
not only violate Islamic teachings but also weaken their cause
vis-a-vis world opinion.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Christians must strive to ensure that our country not only
offers its financial and political support to the Israelis and the
Palestinians, but also extends its moral support to ordinary Israelis
and Palestinians caught between Israel's hard-line policies and the
Palestinians' extremist elements.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli author Amos Oz recently wrote this about the conflagration
in the Middle East:</TE>
<TE>   "Every man of peace must draw water--at least enough to fill the
spoon he holds--and pour it on the fire: ... Object to war crimes by
either side, help the victims of these war crimes; demonstrate,
persuade, write, debate, garner support for reasonable compromise,
oppose the continuation of the Israeli occupation and the ...
campaign for Israel's extermination."</TE>
<TE>   It is not easy for U.S. Jews to heed such words in the face of the
ongoing terrorist attacks on Israelis, numerous recent attacks on
Jews in Europe and threats of violence against U.S. synagogues.</TE>
<TE>   But it is also not easy for U.S. Muslims and Arab American
Christians to heed the call to moderation in light of the
Palestinians' plight, anti-Muslim and anti-Arab bigotry by some U.S.
residents, and the continued detainment of many hundreds of people
because of their Middle East origins.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Christians too have coreligionists in Israel and Palestine
who are suffering amid the strife, so they are finding it difficult
not to blame the Israelis, in particular, for the agony.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of these difficulties, our three faith communities in the
U.S. must step up efforts to instill peaceful and humanitarian values
into the Middle East conflict.</TE>
<TE>   We must convince the Israelis and Palestinians that respecting and
honoring one another and striving for justice neither makes one
"self-hating" nor a "sellout."</TE>
<TE>   Rather, tolerance, compassion and justice--values at the core of
Christianity, Judaism and Islam alike and embodied in the U.S.
ethic--offer the best chance for lasting peace in the Middle East.</TE>

<HD>How to Succeed in Business? Try Ethics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUSHWORTH M. KIDDER</AU>
<BD>Rushworth M. Kidder is founder and president of the
Institute for Global Ethics in Camden, Maine (www.globalethics.org ),
and author of "How Good People Make Tough Choices: Resolving the
Dilemmas of Ethical Living." He can be contacted at
rkidder@globalethics.org.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The day the rivets popped at WorldCom, I was talking about ethics to
a group in Newport Beach. These are savvy financial folks. Yet they
were astonished by the news: a $3.9-billion restatement of earnings,
and potentially the nation's largest corporate bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   A few days later, we could have gasped over Xerox, too, where a
new audit has discovered some $6 billion of fuzzed numbers over the
past five years.</LD>
<LD>   As they used to say in the comics, "Whazzup?!" The answer is just
as direct: "No ethics."</LD>
<TE>   But what accounts for such a hellish spate of moral deviation in
corporate America? One answer, oblique but pungent, comes from The
Wall Street Journal. On June 28, just as Xerox was hitting the front
pages, the paper published a chart titled "High Profiles in Hot
Water." It listed 13 executives from nine corporations--Enron, Tyco,
ImClone, and others--"embroiled in financial controversy." For each,
it listed age, position, tenure, charges, compensation, and personal
information (marital status, children). It also included, without
comment, another column: "Education."</TE>
<TE>   The implication is clear. Want to know where these sophists of the
spreadsheet learned their trade--or, to be fair, never learned the
importance of not cooking the books? Harvard, NYU, Ohio State,
University of Houston, Northwestern, Tufts, Southern Methodist,
Barnard, Seton Hall and other fine schools.</TE>
<TE>   The academics, of course, will howl at this inference. How can you
hold those schools accountable for the deviance of a few, when so
many of their graduates (including readers of this column) care
deeply about ethics?</TE>
<TE>   As they used to say in the comics, "Yeahbut!!" In the last nine
months, something enormous has changed. Following Sept. 11, huge
numbers of ordinary Americans began raising moral questions that went
further than usual below the surface of glossy material comfort. Then
Enron collapsed. Prepared by Sept. 11, the public saw Enron too
through the lens of ethics.</TE>
<TE>   When the dust settles, however, Enron will be a footnote. The real
story here will be the collapse of Enron's auditor, the "Big Five"
firm of Arthur Andersen. What caused its downfall? Analysts agree
that in auditing Enron, Andersen did nothing illegal. But the whole
didn't resemble the parts. They made Enron look like No. 7 on the
Fortune 500, when it was no such thing. What went wrong (at least
until the shredding started) was not lawlessness but a lack of
ethics.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, in a different era, public outrage would have been muted.
But this spring, as Andersen's tale unfolded, ethics was on the
public's mind as never before. In the end, nobody could trust the
firm. For an accountancy, that's the death knell.</TE>
<TE>   What's that got to do with education? Simply this. For decades,
business education programs have telegraphed that ethics isn't
important. To be sure, colleges set up ethics electives. Some even
require business ethics for everyone. But graduates will tell you how
rarely the topic gets discussed outside the ethics class with
anything but mild derision. "We're teaching you useful things to help
you survive," the other courses seem to be saying. "Because ethics
has little to do with survival in the real world, it's optional. So
study it if you wish, but remember what really matters."</TE>
<TE>   It is now jarringly clear that "what really matters" are things
that can change the corporate landscape almost overnight. When "Big
Five" becomes "Big Four" for causes that most business students never
learned, something's amiss. Business education needs to reckon with a
new reality. Ethics in the 21st century is not optional. It's about
survival. Get everything else right and the ethics wrong, and you too
can have your place in the Wall Street Journal--maybe even in jail.</TE>

<HD>Palestinian Public Has a New Foe</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Senior officials' lifestyles and leadership are
fueling anger. Arafat is now openly criticized.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERICHO, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Tucked away on a quiet side street, the sand-colored mansion built
two years ago by Ahmed Korei, speaker of the Palestinian legislature,
was meant to be a haven for the busy politician.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the 12-room home--with its swimming pool, lush
landscaping, privacy wall and guard tower--became an embarrassing
liability. Why, Palestinians began to ask publicly, were senior
officials living in luxury while the continuing fight with Israel
drove their people deeper into poverty?</LD>
<LD>   Two months ago, Korei, an architect of the 1993
Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, abandoned the Jericho home. He
dedicated it, according to the plaque tacked onto the perimeter wall,
to Samed Institute, Workshops of the Children of the Martyrs.</LD>
<TE>   Korei, better known as Abu Alaa, is abroad recovering from a heart
attack and could not be reached for comment. But a lone guard at the
house told a visiting reporter that the building will be remodeled as
a vocational school for children of men killed fighting Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Korei's gesture is testimony to the alarm among senior Palestinian
officials at the seething anger of a people who are beginning to
blame their leaders' alleged corruption and incompetence, and not
just Israeli measures, for their misery.</TE>
<TE>   So great is the people's wrath toward their leaders that some
Palestinian officials fear the eruption of a full-blown rebellion
that would sweep aside Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat
and the revolutionaries who came with him from exile in 1994 to build
a Palestinian state. Some even fear internal assassinations.</TE>
<TE>   No one has produced hard evidence linking any senior Palestinian
official directly to corrupt practices. In fact, an investigator for
the World Bank said recently that he found the levels of corruption
within the Palestinian Authority "no worse than that of other Third
World nations."</TE>
<TE>   But the lavish lifestyle of senior officials and the mansions
built by Korei, senior negotiator Mahmoud Abbas, security chief
Mohammed Dahlan, Social Affairs Minister Intisar Wazir and others,
are proof enough for many Palestinians that their leaders have
enriched their cronies and lined their pockets with money intended
for the public coffers.</TE>
<TE>   Many Palestinians now accept as fact allegations that officials
take kickbacks and bribes from contractors and have misappropriated
funds from Arab states meant to rebuild homes and businesses
destroyed by the Israeli army.</TE>
<TE>   "We are poor, we are critical, we are angry, and also we have a
cause," said Ziad abu Amr, a Palestinian legislator and academic.
"This is a small society, and cases of corruption are highly visible.
People believe that we are supposed to be clean, because we are
fighting for our rights. So, objectively speaking, in relative terms,
our corruption may be less than people think, but it doesn't matter."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians, Abu Amr said, are fed up with seeing "an official
whose salary is $1,000 a month who buys property worth millions.
There was a lot of stealing, extortion, bribery. We had a group of
people who became wealthy by illegitimate means."</TE>
<TE>   "Where have the millions gone?" shouted thousands of unemployed
workers who poured into the streets of Gaza City in a demonstration
against the Palestinian Authority this month. It was a not-so-subtle
question about how millions of dollars in aid from Arab countries and
the international community have been spent by the authority since
fighting erupted in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Soon, the situation will become so dangerous that people will
start accusing everybody, including people like me, of being the
symbol of destruction, of defeat," said Abbas Zaki, a Palestinian
legislator from the West Bank city of Hebron and veteran leader in
Arafat's Fatah movement.</TE>
<TE>   This generation of leaders, Palestinian critics charge, has failed
dismally both at making peace and at making war.</TE>
<TE>   "For the people, they're finished," said Salah Abdul Shafi, a
Gazan economist. "People now even talk about Arafat, and this is
completely new. From 1994 until this intifada, they only whispered
about him. Now they openly criticize him."</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Shafi said he worries that unless Arafat institutes the
top-to-bottom reforms he has promised, "there will be a wave of
internal assassinations." Palestinian ministers, the economist noted,
no longer attend the funerals of Palestinians killed in clashes with
Israeli troops, "because they are afraid of the people."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials offer little defense against the charges of
corruption and mismanagement. Some publicly acknowledge that
corruption has been endemic, and now enthusiastically embrace the
cause of reform. Some have left government and slipped away from the
West Bank and Gaza Strip in the face of growing unrest.</TE>
<TE>   Nabil Amr, the former minister for parliamentary affairs who quit
the Cabinet in April saying he believed that his move would spark
reforms, said he left because he was disgusted by the conduct of
senior officials.</TE>
<TE>   "The Palestinian Authority made the mistake of distributing jobs
as though they were royalties," Amr said. "Everyone from Fatah,
everyone who had someone in their family who spent time in Israeli
jails or who was martyred demanded jobs. And anyone who did not get a
job began to talk about corruption."</TE>
<TE>   Amr and others, including Zaki, now harshly criticize Arafat and
the government he built.</TE>
<TE>   At 60, Zaki has lived most of his adult life as a senior Fatah
official. His personal history is entwined with the tumultuous
history of the Palestine Liberation Organization. He lived through
the defeat of Palestinians and other Arab forces in 1967, when Israel
captured the West Bank from Jordan, and survived Jordan's bloody
expulsion of the PLO from its territory in 1970. He witnessed
Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon and its crushing of the PLO
infrastructure there.</TE>
<TE>   But "none of them compares with this defeat," Zaki said. "Then, I
always felt that I was on the right path. We could understand all the
defeats that we suffered outside, because we are not on our soil. But
now, we are on our ground and we had enough time to succeed. Instead,
we are going back to square one."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the flaws of the 1993 Oslo peace accords, Zaki said, "if
we had worked hard enough and been clean enough, we would have
succeeded."</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in the gloomy, threadbare offices of Fatah's Hebron
headquarters, Zaki said Fatah today is practically nonexistent, as is
the Palestinian Authority. He dismissed Arafat's recently announced
100-day reform plan as a sham that will do nothing to arrest the
disintegration of government and security in the West Bank and Gaza
or reverse Israel's reoccupation of towns and villages.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing will change, Zaki said, until Arafat decides "whether he
wants to be the leader of a revolution or a statesman."</TE>
<TE>   But Arafat's moment of truth, if there is one, may well come too
late. The man still regarded by most Palestinians as an enduring
symbol of their national struggle today is publicly taken to task by
his people in ways that would have been unthinkable even six months
ago. The outpouring of criticism began when Israel's first
large-scale invasion of the West Bank ended this spring and Arafat
emerged from the siege of his headquarters to survey the destruction
of Palestinian Authority ministries and the heavy damage in cities
and refugee camps where Israeli troops fought Palestinian gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   The crowds that turned out to greet him were thin, their calls of
support muted. His visits to the scenes of devastation seemed to
underscore Arafat's inability to protect his people or lead them out
of a struggle that seems unending.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Arafat once again sits surrounded by Israeli troops in the
crumbling remnants of his headquarters in the West Bank city of
Ramallah. And even as he is besieged, the Palestinian leader finds
himself assailed for everything from his failure to organize
meaningful resistance to the Israeli army to his failure to supply
hundreds of thousands of jobless Palestinians with unemployment
checks.</TE>
<TE>   In the Gaza Strip, Jarar Kidwa, the Palestinian Authority's
auditor general, said he finds the public anger alarming. If the
authority is to save itself, Kidwa said, it must quickly enact
reform.</TE>
<TE>   But Arafat, he fears, is cut off from the reality around him and
hardly capable any longer of making decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Kidwa, a cousin of Arafat, attended Cairo University with him and
bears a strong resemblance to the Palestinian leader. Arafat's
portraits adorn Kidwa's well-appointed offices in Gaza City. But he
spoke angrily about the fraud and abuse he says he has seen in
government ministries since the inception of the Palestinian
Authority.</TE>
<TE>   "I told [Arafat]: 'Let me, I can clean up all the government
administration,' but he didn't say a word," Kidwa said of a recent
telephone conversation with his cousin. "It is not that we don't know
how to run a country. But he is still holding all the reins in his
hands instead of devolving authority."</TE>
<TE>   In May 1997, Kidwa issued the first publicized report on
corruption within the Palestinian Authority. It detailed misuse of
funds by government departments and caused such an uproar among
Palestinians and donor nations that Arafat never allowed Kidwa to
publish another one.</TE>
<TE>   A retired Citibank official, Kidwa continues to investigate fraud
and mismanagement in government agencies and tries to oversee the
expenditure of public funds. Waving a sheaf of phone bills, he
boasted of paying "every one" of the personal calls he placed from
his government office.</TE>
<TE>   "When I am given evidence of wrongdoing, I investigate," he said.
But he acknowledged that he has never been allowed to oversee the
security services or Arafat's office, or investigate Palestinian
Authority investments. And each year, when he completes his report,
only one other man sees it.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not allowed to make my report public. Our enemies can use it
against us," Kidwa explained. "So I prepare it and present it to the
president."</TE>
<TE>   It is the authority's failure to publish his reports and to hold
wrongdoers accountable, Kidwa said, that has fueled what he says is
the false perception of corruption on a massive scale.</TE>
<TE>   There have been abuses of government funds by some departments,
fictitious employees on payrolls, kickbacks to some contractors,
bloated entourages accompanying some ministers on unnecessary
overseas trips, he said. "But there are offenses and people abusing
their authority in every country in the world," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Kidwa said, the exiles who returned with Arafat from his
headquarters in Tunisia were ill-prepared to run government
ministries. In Tunis, he said, "there was a lot of corruption. The
PLO didn't have auditors, didn't have controls. Now, they have actual
government departments. In Tunis, there were 2,000 to 5,000 people on
the payroll. Here, there are 121,546 civil servants."</TE>
<TE>   Trouble is, he said, Arafat and his men tried to run their
state-in-the-making as if it were still a small guerrilla operation.</TE>
<TE>   In the cramped Nablus offices of the refugee lobbying organization
he heads, Palestinian legislator Hussam Khader allowed himself to
indulge in "I told you so" for a moment. For years, when it was still
dangerous to speak out about it, Khader, a strongman in the Balata
refugee camp who spent long stints in Israeli prisons and years in
exile as a Fatah official, has publicly complained about the
corruption of senior Palestinian officials.</TE>
<TE>   He caused a stir at the start of the current revolt when he
claimed that 50 Palestinian officials had sent their families abroad
to spare them the suffering ordinary Palestinians were asked to
endure.</TE>
<TE>   Khader has watched with disbelief as the very ministers he has
attacked for corruption have begun to call for reform and denounce
corruption.</TE>
<TE>   He dismissed the notion that the system can be cleaned up as long
as Arafat is in power.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a failure," he said. "I hope we kick him out" in upcoming
elections, scheduled for January.</TE>
<TE>   For Khader, the talk of reform is too little, too late. After
nearly two years of bloodshed, he is tired and despondent. He has
watched his friends die, seen his camp reoccupied by Israeli troops,
had his home trashed by invading soldiers and seen many of the young
generation of Palestinians broken by the fighting that has neither
ended the occupation nor produced peace.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time," he said, "Arafat wins the battle and the Palestinian
people lose the war. Even when he is in the ground, he will think
that he is in control."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the people are openly expressing their anger now, Khader
said. But he fears that the wave of criticism will not lead to the
establishment of a new political system.</TE>
<TE>   "The people talk about their anger, but they won't come in the
streets," he predicted. "We still have people who worship Yasser
Arafat as much as they worship God."</TE>

<HD>25 Hindu Civilians Killed in Kashmir</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JAMMU, India</DL>
<LD>Suspected Islamic guerrillas threw grenades and opened fire Saturday
in a crowded slum in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir,
killing at least 25 Hindu civilians.</LD>
<LD>   Most of those killed in the evening attack outside Jammu, the
winter capital of Jammu and Kashmir state, were women and children,
an officer at the state's police control room said on condition of
anonymity. More than 30 others were wounded.</LD>
<LD>   Up to eight suspected Islamic militants walked into the Qasimnagar
slum and threw three or four grenades before opening fire with
automatic weapons, witnesses told police. They fled after trading
gunfire with security forces, who launched a manhunt in the area.</LD>
<TE>   The attack was the biggest since a May 14 assault by Islamic
guerrillas on a military base near Jammu that killed 34
people--mostly soldiers' wives and children.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses to Saturday's attack said the first grenade exploded
while many in the shantytown were watching a cricket match between
India and England on television. Dozens of people rushed to
investigate, many of whom were killed by the blasts that followed
over the next few minutes.</TE>
<TE>   State Police Chief Ashok Suri said authorities suspect the
Lashkar-e-Taiba, one of more than a dozen Islamic groups fighting to
secure independence or merger with mostly Muslim Pakistan for the
Indian-held part of Kashmir. He did not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   No group has claimed responsibility for the incident.</TE>
<TE>   India and Pakistan both claim all of Kashmir, a Himalayan region
divided between the two countries after they gained independence from
Britain in 1947. India controls two-thirds and Pakistan the rest.</TE>

<HD>China-Taiwan Overtures Hint at New Talks</HD>
<DH>Asia: The two longtime foes might be considering direct
trade and other ties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TAIPEI, Taiwan</DL>
<LD>Recent statements from Taiwan and mainland China have heightened
speculation that the two longtime adversaries might at last be
preparing for talks to open direct trade, transportation and
telecommunications links across the Taiwan Strait.</LD>
<LD>   Hints of possible change first came in May, when Taiwanese
President Chen Shui-bian indicated a willingness to let
nongovernmental groups play a role in negotiating the direct links.
Beijing quickly applauded Chen's comments and established a special
trade promotion committee.</LD>
<LD>   Because the mainland Communist authorities view Taiwan as a rebel
province that rightly belongs under their control, they have
consistently refused government-to-government talks.</LD>
<TE>   This month, Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen appeared to drop
Beijing's long-standing precondition to talks: that Taiwan endorse
the idea that there is only one legitimate government for China, an
idea known as the "one China" policy. Although other comments by Qian
appeared to cast some doubt on the sincerity of his remarks, senior
Taiwanese officials remained cautiously upbeat.</TE>
<TE>   "We consider this as a time when both sides are building
momentum," said Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs
Council, the government body most closely involved in cross-strait
ties.</TE>
<TE>   Direct ties between Taiwan and mainland China would help ease
tensions along one of the world's few remaining Cold War political
fault lines--one that has drawn U.S. naval ships to the region
several times.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the peaceful overtures, a Pentagon report last week said
China is pursuing a defense buildup that especially threatens Taiwan.
It cited the addition of short-range ballistic missiles in Fujian
province, across from Taiwan. China has also acquired Russian-made
submarines, which could cut off Taiwan's sea lanes and threaten
American forces that might respond, the Pentagon said.</TE>
<TE>   But the hope is that direct trade and other ties would streamline
a large and growing indirect commercial relationship between Taiwan
and mainland China that has developed over the last two decades
despite the political tensions. There has been no direct trade across
the strait since China's Nationalist Party leader, Chiang Kai-shek,
retreated with his supporters to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a bitter
civil war to the Communists.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing broke off most unofficial contacts with Taiwan three years
ago after the island's then-president, Lee Teng-hui, said ties
between Taipei and Beijing should be like those between two states.</TE>
<TE>   Few of those following events in the region believe that
negotiations for direct links would be either quick or easy. Many
talk of a process that could take years to complete. Still, several
factors fuel a guarded optimism that a start might be possible.</TE>
<TE>   Among them:</TE>
<TE>   * Direct ties carry potentially strong benefits for both sides,
political analysts believe.</TE>
<TE>   For Beijing, they would bind the democratic island more closely to
the mainland's huge market. They also would likely boost Taiwan's
already considerable contribution to the mainland's industrial
growth.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, indirect trade between China and Taiwan totaled nearly
$28 billion, while Taiwan's cumulative investment in mainland China
now tops $50 billion, according to statistics from Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   For Taiwan, dealing with these investments directly rather than
via circuitous routes would substantially cut operating costs. A
Taipei executive who today requires a full day to reach his plant in
Shanghai because he must fly via Hong Kong would cut his travel time
to 90 minutes on a direct flight.</TE>
<TE>   Direct links would also make Taiwan far more attractive to foreign
investors looking for a base for their operations in mainland China,
business executives argue.</TE>
<TE>   "If there are no [direct] links, then there will be no [regional
corporate] headquarters for greater China in Taipei," Stan Shih, head
of Taiwan's largest computer group, Acer, told journalists last week.</TE>
<TE>   * The timing for both sides seems more favorable than at any point
in recent years. With the opposition Nationalists in disarray in
Taiwan and the growing possibility that Chen might win a second
four-year term in a presidential election scheduled for 2004, there
are good reasons for Beijing to change its policy of shunning Chen,
analysts believe.</TE>
<TE>   They say a new Chinese leadership expected to emerge from this
fall's 16th Communist Party Congress would be freer to make this
shift.</TE>
<TE>   For Chen, simply getting negotiations started would be an enormous
political windfall. It would ease pressure from many of Taiwan's
leading business executives who are worried about the cost of dealing
with an increasingly important market through convoluted routes.</TE>
<TE>   Such a breakthrough would also be popular among Taiwan's large
bloc of moderate, independent voters who have viewed Chen's inability
to work with China as a major drawback. In the past, China has
denounced Chen's Democratic Progressive Party as a separatist
movement.</TE>
<TE>   * The conclusion this month of a commercial air agreement between
Hong Kong and Taipei has proven that Chen's government can negotiate
successfully with a government that is part of the People's Republic
of China, Taiwan officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very helpful process for us," Tsai said. "It is
significant that both sides can actually work together to work
something out that is acceptable to both sides."</TE>
<TE>   During those talks, which took a year to complete, Taiwan's
eight-member negotiating team was known as the
nongovernmental-sounding Taipei Airlines Assn., but in fact it
included three members of Taiwan's government.</TE>
<TE>   Noted a seasoned Taiwan-based diplomat: "Taiwan conceded the name,
but the outcome was just like any other international agreement. It
showed what Beijing really wanted was a fig leaf."</TE>
<TE>   Tsai indicated that a similar ambiguity might help get
negotiations started with the mainland on direct links but that once
started, the talks themselves would be far more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   She noted that, unlike the Taiwan-Hong Kong accord, there would be
no prior agreement or earlier relationship to build on.</TE>

<HD>Ravers Throng Berlin's Annual Love Parade</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Downtown Berlin's main park was transformed Saturday into a sea of
gyrating techno fans, who blew whistles and danced ecstatically to
booming beats as the German capital's Love Parade hit the streets for
its 14th year.</LD>
<LD>   Throngs of scantily clad revelers, many sporting garishly colored
hair and outlandish outfits, crowded around 45 techno floats as they
made their way from the edges of the Tiergarten park toward the
Victory Column, the center point of the daylong event. Some of them
clambered onto traffic signs and street lamps.</LD>
<LD>   Still, police estimated at only about 500,000 the number of people
who turned out--a little more than half of last year's figure of
800,000 and far short of the record 1.5 million in 1999. Organizers
said about 750,000 people attended.</LD>
<TE>   The Love Parade, which began in 1989 as a small procession of 150
ravers, has become a Berlin institution and a massive tourist draw.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea it would be so exciting," said Jenny Schneider, a
21-year-old from Bismarck, N.D., who is studying German in the city
of Freiburg. "People said it would be like Woodstock, but it's
actually much, much better."</TE>

<HD>Mexican Farmers Take 3 More Hostages</HD>
<DH>Standoff: Now holding 15 captives, they demand formal talks
in land dispute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Farmers armed with machetes and homemade firebombs took three more
hostages Saturday and demanded formal negotiations to end their
violent standoff with the government over plans to build an airport
on their land 18 miles northeast of Mexico City.</LD>
<LD>   The showdown was in its third day with no sign of a breakthrough.
Hundreds of protesters are now holding 15 captives in the tense,
barricaded town of San Salvador Atenco, which is surrounded by about
900 riot policemen. Police have jailed two protest leaders and 10
followers.</LD>
<LD>   Federal authorities last October ordered 13,300 acres in the rural
municipality expropriated for the $2.3-billion airport, setting off
months of sporadic protests that exploded in violence late Thursday.
The farmers seized government offices in the town, abducted local
officials, hijacked and burned vehicles, and attacked policemen with
machetes. About 30 people were injured.</LD>
<TE>   Protest organizers and officials of the state of Mexico have been
on the phone at least five times since then, trying to work out an
exchange of captives.</TE>
<TE>   Those talks hit a snag Friday, despite jailed protest leader
Ignacio del Valle's telephone appeal to followers to accept the
state's offer. Under that proposal, Del Valle and Adan Espinoza, who
face charges of inciting violence and stabbing a policeman, would
stay in jail but the 10 other protesters and all the hostages would
go free.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers assembled in the town's auditorium shouted down the
proposal. Participants said Del Valle must have endorsed it under
duress. "They're torturing him!" one farmer shouted.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference late Friday, other protesters again insisted
on the release of all 12 prisoners. They demanded that the federal
government, not the state, take charge of the conflict and agree to
formal negotiations through a mediator. They proposed three human
rights champions to play that role.</TE>
<TE>   President Vicente Fox's administration has tried to stay out of
the conflict, saying the airport construction would continue as
planned. However, Interior Minister Santiago Creel said federal
officials were ready to negotiate with any group disposed to a
peaceful settlement--but would "act with a firm hand to avoid an
increase of violence."</TE>
<TE>   About 34,000 people live in villages and farmland destined for the
new six-runway facility that would replace Mexico City's Benito
Juarez International Airport. Many object that the federal
government's offer to buy their land for 70 cents per square meter is
too low, while others refuse to leave at any price.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute has put Fox's government at odds with its erstwhile
leftist ally, the Democratic Revolution Party. Rosario Robles, the
party's leader, called Saturday for a "human fence" around San
Salvador Atenco, saying its residents must be protected.</TE>
<TE>   The protesters took three more hostages Saturday, identifying them
as undercover state police officers posing as journalists.</TE>
<TE>   For the second day in a row, leaders of the uprising brought
hostages before TV cameras to show that they had not been harmed.
They include several policemen and state officials. Some took the
opportunity to talk to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "I call on my superiors, on state officials and on President Fox
not to abandon us," said Jose Andres Mediola, a deputy state
prosecutor and the most prominent hostage. "I want to go home. I want
to feel like authorities and the government are doing all they can to
get me there."</TE>

<HD>Israel Captures Would-Be Bomber</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli troops caught a Palestinian would-be suicide bomber after he
opened fire on a military patrol conducting searches outside a
Palestinian village near the West Bank border, the army said today.</LD>
<LD>   "The terrorist fired at army jeeps outside Anin village, but the
soldiers subdued and interrogated him," a spokeswoman said. "He led
them to a bomb belt he had hidden close by and, we believe, was
planning to detonate later in Israel."</LD>
<LD>   The incident late Saturday night put central Israel in a high
state of alert, a reminder of violence still simmering despite a
near-total Israeli military closure of the West Bank and curfew on
hundreds of thousands of Palestinian residents.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli media reports said the gunman had intended to disguise
himself as an Israeli soldier and travel to the northern Israeli city
of Afula, where he would open fire and then blow himself up.</TE>
<TE>   Jihad Kabalan, commander of paramilitary border police in northern
Israel, said the gunman first entered an Israeli Arab town looking
for transportation before heading back toward the West Bank and
firing at the military patrol.</TE>
<TE>   "He went to [the Israeli Arab town of] Umm al Fahm and asked taxi
drivers to drive him, but they refused," Kabalan told Channel Two
television. "It was apparently supposed to be a big attack, involving
shooting and suicide."</TE>
<TE>   In the Gaza Strip--where, as in the West Bank, Palestinians are
waging a 21-month-old uprising--militants fired five mortar shells at
a Jewish settlement, hurting no one, the army said. Israeli forces
later scoured the nearby Palestinian town of Deir al Balah.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Saturday, Israel delayed indefinitely a meeting with
Palestinians to ease security and economic restrictions. Palestinian
officials had no immediate comment.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank</DL>
<LD>In the weeks since tanks rolled into the West Bank, Israelis and
Palestinians have debated whether Israel has turned back the clock.</LD>
<LD>   Has the old Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories
really resumed? Does the current military incursion shut the door on
the 1993 Oslo peace accords, which had given the Palestinians a
measure of autonomy and put them on what just a few years ago looked
to be an inevitable trajectory toward statehood?</LD>
<LD>   And besides the existential questions, there are the mundane.</LD>
<TE>   For instance, who will pick up the garbage?</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli government insists that what it has dubbed Operation
Determined Path is designed merely to root out terrorists and that
the army is not in the West Bank to stay.</TE>
<TE>   "Been there, done that," said an Israeli military intelligence
officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, military intelligence has warned that suicide
bombings would resume in Israel within one week after the army
withdraws. And Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon told his Cabinet
this month that the army will need to remain in the West Bank for an
extended period--unlike a recent massive operation in which the army
remained only five weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli military experts warn that it will be nearly impossible
for Israel to maintain its military presence without slipping back
into the kind of government it established after the 1967 conquest of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Until the peace accords began
transferring authority to Palestinian self-rule in 1994, the Israeli
government maintained a cumbersome and expensive bureaucracy to run
everything from schools to garbage collection.</TE>
<TE>   "You are either in or out. There is no middle ground," said Yoni
Fighel, a former Israeli colonel who once served as military governor
of the West Bank city of Ramallah. "If you are responsible
militarily, you inevitably have to take responsibility for all
civilian life as well."</TE>
<TE>   The latest Israeli operation began in the early morning of June
19, sandwiched between two suicide bombings in Jerusalem that killed
26 people. Tanks moved into Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah, Bethlehem,
Hebron, Tulkarm and Kalkilya--all the major West Bank cities except
Jericho. Unlike the reaction to the previous incursion, there was
little resistance and little international protest. And in a region
numbed by the repetition of violence and retaliation, the incursion
has received relatively few headlines.</TE>
<TE>   The most visible manifestation of the Israeli presence in four of
the seven cities in recent weeks were curfews and checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the West Bank, the army has blocked roads with heaps of
dirt and stone, broken refrigerators and burned hulks of old cars.
Unable to travel by car, Palestinians have become backpackers and
hikers. Even in the unremitting summer heat, they often carry
improbably large burdens--suitcases, appliances, sometimes elderly
parents--along the parched roads.</TE>
<TE>   Life in the West Bank cities ebbs and flows with the curfews. When
Israel lifts the restrictions, the cities are choked with manic
energy as Palestinians rush to accomplish what might otherwise take
an entire day.</TE>
<TE>   When the clock runs out, heavy metal shutters clang shut over shop
windows and Palestinians scurry back to their homes. Israeli tanks
and jeeps, largely invisible when the curfew is lifted, rumble into
the streets.</TE>
<TE>   In the first few days of Operation Determined Path, many of the
Palestinian casualties were children who apparently didn't understand
the rules and were hit by warning shots fired by the Israeli army to
deter curfew violators.</TE>
<TE>   The curfew rules are confusing, with the hours varying from day to
day and seldom announced in advance--deliberately, the army says, to
deter terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   After four people were killed by Israeli tank fire in Jenin on
June 21, the curfews became more leniently enforced. In Bethlehem,
some shops now stay open during curfews, selling wares discreetly
through back doors. On curfew days in Hebron, many children take
advantage of the lack of cars by kicking soccer balls through the
streets.</TE>
<TE>   Samieh Amra, 46, a Ramallah homemaker, recalled that during
curfews imposed in March and April, residents were too terrified to
poke their heads out of their doors or plant their gardens.</TE>
<TE>   "We were so scared. We wouldn't even talk on the telephone.... Now
we're used to living like this," Amra said as she sat with friends
under a grape arbor in her backyard sipping coffee during a curfew.</TE>
<TE>   But the more relaxed curfews also worry Palestinians, who see them
not as emergency measures, but as part of a longer-term remedy for
the problem of Palestinian militancy.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels different this time," Amra said. "Like they are here to
stay."</TE>
<TE>   In this environment, it is difficult for the Palestinian Authority
to provide basic services to the West Bank's 1.6 million residents.
Government offices are open only a few days a week, if at all.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, many offices and other official facilities have been
destroyed over the last 21 months in Israeli retaliation for
terrorist attacks that Israel believes were directed by the
Palestinian Authority. Most civil servants can't get to work anyway
because of the curfews and roadblocks.</TE>
<TE>   In the Bethlehem region, for example, fewer than 100 of 2,000
Palestinian Authority employees were working during two recent weeks.
The only departments functioning were the water, electricity and
health departments, according to Bethlehem Gov. Mohammed Madani, who
was able to get to his office for only a few hours each day during a
recent week.</TE>
<TE>   "The Israelis want to occupy us without the costs and
consequences. But I think what they want to do won't work, and what
they are doing is very dangerous," said Madani, sitting at his desk
under one of the ubiquitous photographs of Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat that adorn all official offices.</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to limit their presence, the Israelis have shied
away from routine police work. But the Palestinian police aren't
really functioning, creating a power vacuum.</TE>
<TE>   Samer Khoury, a Bethlehem restaurant owner, recalled a recent car
accident in front of his establishment. Nobody could figure out whom
to call.</TE>
<TE>   "The Palestinian police aren't working," Khoury said. "There are
no Israeli police."</TE>
<TE>   In Jenin, Mohammed abu Dieb, 26, complains about the mounds of
garbage piling up, the wrecked buildings on the verge of collapse,
the erratic water and electricity supplies.</TE>
<TE>   "We are hanging in between the two sides. We don't know if the
Israelis or the Palestinians are in charge," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If the Palestinian Authority is unable to cope with running the
West Bank, Israel isn't exactly well-equipped to do so.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli civil administration, which was the government in the
West Bank until Palestinians were granted self-rule, now has only a
few hundred employees, down from 14,000 during its peak, according to
spokesman Peter Lerner.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli government says it has no plans to return the civil
administration to its former magnitude, but just the same, the agency
is getting more involved in daily administrative matters.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not running things like we used to [before 1994], but
there is a lot more coordination and intensity to our role," Lerner
said.</TE>
<TE>   The civil administration recently began issuing internal travel
permits--necessary for Palestinians to move between West Bank cities.
It is trying to work more closely with the Palestinian Authority
ministries to, for instance, coordinate hours and routes permitted
for garbage trucks and grant permits for municipal crews to work
during curfews.</TE>
<TE>   All this makes some Palestinians deeply suspicious. But the
prevailing view on both sides seems to be that a new occupation is
something that neither side really wants.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the Israelis want to bring back the occupation.
That would be expensive and dangerous for them," said Haidar Irsheid,
the Palestinian governor of Jenin.</TE>

<HD>Pakistan Blast Injures at Least 12 During Tour</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PESHAWAR, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>An explosion Saturday possibly caused by a grenade injured about a
dozen people, most of them German tourists, at an archeological site
in northern Pakistan, officials said. No one was seriously hurt.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said the incident occurred in Mansehra, about 50 miles
north of Islamabad, the capital. The area is on the ancient Silk Road
between China and Europe and is rich in archeological sites.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the blast occurred as about 20 tourists were leaving
their van to view ancient inscriptions associated with the 3rd
century BC Mauryan emperor Ashoka.</LD>
<TE>   Police said seven Germans, three Austrians and three Pakistanis
were injured. In Islamabad, however, the Interior Ministry listed
seven Germans, one Austrian, one Slovene and three Pakistanis.</TE>
<TE>   The tourists were headed to Islamabad under police escort, and it
was impossible to clarify the difference. The government-run news
agency quoted army Brig. Javed Iqbal Cheema as saying that all the
injured had been treated at a hospital and released.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they were uncertain what caused the blast, but the
news agency quoted a senior Interior Ministry official as saying it
was probably caused by a crude explosive device thrown at the
tourists.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they had brought an undisclosed number of people in
for questioning.</TE>
<TE>   A June 14 car bombing outside the U.S. Consulate in Karachi killed
12 Pakistanis and injured 50. On May 8, a suicide bomber killed 11
French engineers and two other people in front of the Sheraton hotel
in Karachi. On March 17, a grenade attack on a church in Islamabad
killed the attacker and four others, including two Americans.</TE>

<HD>Model Supersonic Jet Crashes in Desert</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WOOMERA, Australia</DL>
<LD>A scale model of a Japanese supersonic jetliner exploded shortly
after it was launched Sunday on the back of a booster rocket and
crashed into the central Australian desert, witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   The disastrous end to the first test of Japan's National
Experimental Supersonic Transport, or NEXST, came seconds after
takeoff from the Woomera rocket testing range.</LD>
<LD>   No one was injured in the crash; both the rocket and the model
plane were unmanned.</LD>
<TE>   The Japanese government-funded project aims to build a plane that
would fly at twice the speed of sound, with the supersonic boom
reduced to the rumble of a Boeing 747.</TE>
<TE>   The plane would fly twice the distance of the Concorde, which has
a range of 3,550 nautical miles, and seat three times as many
passengers. The Concorde typically holds 100 passengers.</TE>
<TE>   After the rocket climbed to about 330 feet, it turned over and
began spiraling erratically through the air before slamming into the
ground and exploding, witnesses at the test site said.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the crash was not immediately known. The Japanese
team responsible for the test did not immediately comment but was
expected to give a news conference later today.</TE>
<TE>   The launch had been postponed several times because of strong
winds.</TE>
<TE>   The 36-foot model was to have ridden piggyback on the booster
rocket to a height of 12.5 miles at a speed exceeding 1,500 mph.</TE>
<TE>   After performing a barrel roll, the booster was supposed to
release the model, which was to have glided to Earth in a 14-minute
flight to test its automatic flight systems.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing Co., which is developing its own "Sonic Cruiser"--designed
to fly at just under the speed of sound--was eagerly awaiting the
results of the Japanese project.</TE>

<HD>Tibetan Teacher Freed by China Lands in U.S.</HD>
<DH>Asia: Release of longtime political prisoner appears to be
a move to improve ties with Washington.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY KUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>China sent a Tibetan schoolteacher thought to be its longest-serving
political prisoner to the United States for medical treatment on
Saturday in what a prominent human rights campaigner said appeared to
be an effort to improve ties with Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Accompanied by a U.S. diplomat, Tanak Jigme Sangpo, 74, took a
United Airlines flight from Beijing to Chicago, and proceeded to
Washington, where he will stay with a niece.</LD>
<LD>   "We're looking at a move to use the release of Tibetan prisoners
to improve relations with the U.S.," said John Kamm, head of the San
Francisco-based human rights group Dui Hua Foundation, which
negotiated with Beijing for Jigme Sangpo's release. But Kamm added in
a telephone interview from San Francisco, "I'm not prepared to say
that there's any signal of a change in [Beijing's] Tibet policy."</LD>
<TE>   Jigme Sangpo has been the focus of intense lobbying by foreign
governments.</TE>
<TE>   His case was raised during trips to China by U.S. Rep. Tom Lantos
(D-San Mateo) in January and President Bush in February. U.S.
Ambassador to China Clark T. Randt Jr. has publicly raised Jigme
Sangpo's case in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Jigme Sangpo has also topped the lists of cases that European
governments have raised with Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   Since September, Chinese authorities have released or reduced the
prison sentences of several notable Tibetan prisoners, including five
Buddhist "singing nuns," who were punished for recording and
smuggling pro-independence songs out of Drapchi Prison in Lhasa, the
Tibetan capital.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very much a decision made at the top of the leadership,
and it's being implemented by the central ministries in Beijing,"
Kamm said of Jigme Sangpo's case. "But at the level of the local
Tibetan government, I did not sense any enthusiasm for this release
at all," said Kamm, who was allowed to visit Jigme Sangpo in June.</TE>
<TE>   Jigme Sangpo was reportedly first arrested in 1960s. As a teacher
at an elementary school in Lhasa, he was accused of corrupting his
students. By one account, his arrest stemmed from his refusal to
punish a student who criticized Mao Tse-tung.</TE>
<TE>   According to human rights groups, Jigme Sangpo wrote a letter in
1970 to the Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhism's highest priest, detailing
Chinese abuse of Tibetans. Jigme Sangpo's niece was to deliver it to
the Dalai Lama in India, where the leader has lived in exile since
1959. Authorities foiled Jigme Sangpo's bid and sentenced him to 10
years of "reform through labor."</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, authorities arrested Jigme Sangpo again, this time for
posting handwritten, pro-Tibetan independence posters on the main
gates of Tibet's holiest shrine, the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa. He was
sentenced him to 15 years in prison for "counterrevolutionary
propaganda and incitement," according to the Tibetan government in
exile.</TE>
<TE>   His sentence was extended in 1988 by five years because of a
prison protest. During a 1991 visit by an official Swiss delegation
to Drapchi Prison, Jigme Sangpo momentarily broke free and bellowed
"Free Tibet!" in English within earshot of the group. Authorities
responded by adding an additional eight years to his sentence.</TE>
<TE>   His sentence was due to expire in 2011, when he would be 85 and
have spent 41 years in prison. Human rights groups widely considered
him to be China's longest-serving political prisoner.</TE>
<TE>   Jigme Sangpo, who has coronary disease and high blood pressure,
was released by Chinese authorities on medical parole in April. He
lived with his niece in Lhasa under tight security, and officials
reportedly denied his requests to visit the Jokhang Temple.</TE>
<TE>   "Jigme Sangpo is about as pure a human rights case as you can
imagine," Kamm said. "His case has always involved pure and simple,
nonviolent expression of his belief in an independent Tibet, and for
that he has paid a huge price."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Kamm delivered to Chinese authorities a list of 20
Tibetan political prisoners about whom he sought information. The
Chinese response in October mentioned the release of several
prisoners, and Kamm is hoping for further releases as Beijing updates
information on other cases.</TE>
<TE>   Kamm was allowed to see Jigme Sangpo in Lhasa in June.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very dignified and educated," Kamm said. "I think the world
is going to get to know this guy and be very impressed by what they
see."</TE>

<HD>Markets Nearing Crucial Stage</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Persistently declining stock values may
trigger greater economic and budget woes. But some investors see a
choice time to buy.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The stock market's latest slide to five-year lows is raising new
risks for the economy, government coffers and foreigners' willingness
to invest in U.S. assets.</LD>
<LD>   It's also confounding market pros--and millions of individual
investors--who now are focused on trying to pinpoint the end of
stocks' long decline, in the hope of reaping huge rewards when prices
finally turn.</LD>
<LD>   The debate over the beleaguered market's next move took on greater
urgency last week, when blue-chip share indexes suffered their
biggest one-week drop since the plunge that followed the September
terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   By some measures, the losses since the market's zenith in March
2000 already rank as the worst since the Great Depression. And, as
stocks continue to fall, experts warn there is mounting risk of
collateral damage--most significantly, to the economy, federal and
state budgets, and to the inflow of badly needed foreign capital.</TE>
<TE>   Economist Bill Dudley at brokerage firm Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. in New
York last week told clients he is "becoming more pessimistic about
the economic outlook," which he said "reflects mainly the weakness of
the U.S. equity market."</TE>
<TE>   An index of consumer confidence last week dropped to its lowest
level since November, which economists said stemmed in part from
Americans' concerns about the market's woes. More than half of all
U.S. households are believed to own equities.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the White House Office of Management and Budget
forecast a $165-billion federal deficit for fiscal 2002 and warned
that "the stock market and the capital gains receipts it generates
have become more important than ever to the federal budget outlook."</TE>
<TE>   The implication is that, without a market rebound, the deficit
could balloon further. The same may be true in states such as
California, where a collapse in capital gains taxes has helped create
a $23.6-billion budget gap.</TE>
<TE>   Also last week, the dollar's value fell to a two-year low against
the euro and a nine-month low against the Japanese yen, a sign that
foreign investors increasingly are selling U.S. securities and taking
their money elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Because the United States continues to run a massive trade
deficit, foreign capital inflows are critical. Without that money the
economy could sputter for lack of investment, economists warn.</TE>
<TE>   As the worries pile up, however, so too does the sense that the
stock market may at last be nearing rock bottom. Historically, that
has often been the case: Bear markets end when investors' mood is at
its gloomiest. And the rallies that follow usually are explosive.</TE>
<TE>   But on the information-overloaded Wall Street of the 21st century,
everyone knows, or thinks they know, how to measure when sentiment
hits that critical point that signals it's time to buy shares.</TE>
<TE>   And that's part of the problem: Investors, bullish and bearish,
are intently watching the same technical indicators, and in so doing
they may be skewing the readings of some of those indicators--further
handicapping efforts to get a clear view of whether the market is
ready to turn.</TE>
<TE>   One well-known barometer is a weekly survey of market newsletter
writers nationwide by a service known as Investors Intelligence.
Historically, when the percentage of newsletter writers who are
bearish on stocks exceeds the percentage who are bullish, it usually
has signaled that stock-selling has reached at least a temporary
peak. That was the case in late September.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, bullish newsletter writers outnumber bears by 39.8% to
36.7% (the rest count themselves as relatively neutral). That
astounds many analysts, given the enormousness of the market's recent
losses. It indicates a lack of fear and raises the question: Are many
investors staying optimistic only because they assume everyone else
is giving up?</TE>
<TE>   If that's the case, it may mean that the bottom for share prices
still is far away, some say, because too few people have yet sold.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is a market technician today," said economist Paul
Kasriel at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. "And everyone is waiting
for [other investors'] capitulation to signal it's time to buy."</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is watching for the same signs," said Joe Sunderman,
trading manager at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati.
"Well, a watched pot never boils."</TE>
<TE>   Yet some market pros are telling clients that many stocks have
fallen to levels where the only smart decision is to snap them up,
despite the black cloud of corporate financial scandals hanging over
Wall Street and the threat of more terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Barton Biggs, a veteran investment strategist at brokerage Morgan
Stanley in New York, who was a voice of caution during the late 1990s
market surge, last week wrote an essay titled "Don't Bet Against
America." In it, he said that "at today's prices, I do think that
investors can make money in the short run, and this is no time to be
selling stocks."</TE>
<TE>   Biggs may have felt motivated to speak up when the market failed
to rally after President Bush delivered his ethics lecture to
corporate America last Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average
tumbled 695 points, or 7.4%, for the week, to end Friday at 8,684.53.
That was the biggest weekly decline since the Dow skidded 14.3% in
the week the markets reopened following the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index, dominated by the nation's technology
giants, fell 5.2% last week to 1,373.50. Nasdaq, now at levels last
seen in May 1997, has fallen 73% from its March 2000 peak, a decline
that is nearing the 90% drop in major market indexes in the
Depression years of 1929-32.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Wall Street is hoping for encouraging words from an
authority considered second only to Bush: Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed chief on Tuesday morning will deliver his semiannual
economic report to Congress. In testimony before a Senate committee,
Greenspan is expected to sound upbeat. And although he isn't expected
to offer a definitive view on whether stocks are overpriced or
underpriced, he is likely to sound reassuring about the market's
long-term health and may suggest that there is a "disconnect" between
the market's slide and what is happening in the economy, analysts
say.</TE>
<TE>   "I see him painting the glass as half-full," Goldman Sachs' Dudley
said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the news in recent weeks has been far from grim. Auto
sales were surprisingly strong in June, and though the national
unemployment rate ticked up to 5.9% last month, average hourly wages
for production workers rose--an important indicator of consumers'
ability to keep spending. Also, mortgage rates have fallen again to
near all-time lows, further bolstering the robust housing market.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most important for investors, companies are beginning to
report their earnings for the quarter ended June 30, and the results
overall are expected to show the first increase since the fourth
quarter of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   General Electric Co., a conglomerate often considered a microcosm
of the U.S. economy, on Friday said that its earnings rose 14% in the
second quarter from a year earlier and that profit in the current
quarter could rise 25% as the economy improves. The company's stock
gained $1.25 to $28.60 on Friday after dropping to $27.05 on
Wednesday, the lowest price since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street's weakness in the face of the prospect of rebounding
earnings is forcing analysts to ask whether the market might be
signaling that the economic recovery soon will run out of steam.</TE>
<TE>   Few economists believe the nation will slip back into recession.
"Fortunately, the average person on the street, who does not own many
stocks, has not been affected very much by the plunge in equity
prices and continues to spend," said Sung Won Sohn, economist at
Wells Fargo &amp; Co. in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   But some experts, such as Dudley, say the continuing slide in
share prices might be a harbinger of an extended period of "subpar"
economic growth, as the fallout spreads from the bursting of the late
1990s market bubble, perhaps the biggest in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   "When the bubble is being created, most of the ripple effects are
favorable, and these effects act to sustain and extend the boom,"
Dudley said. "When the bubble bursts, all of these forces move in the
opposite direction. It takes a long time for all the negative
consequences associated with the bubble's demise to become fully
apparent."</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts, however, believe the stock market's main problem is
unrelated to the economy. They say stocks simply remain too
high-priced relative to expected earnings, despite the plunge since
2000.</TE>
<TE>   The blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index has dropped nearly 40%
from its peak in March 2000, yet the average stock in the index is
priced at about 19 times this year's expected earnings per share, by
many Wall Street estimates. That is far above the historical average
price-to-earnings ratio of about 14.</TE>
<TE>   "So high were prices at the peak that they are still not cheap
more than two years after the peak," said Jim Grant, editor of
Grant's Interest Rate Observer, a well-read--and long bearish--market
newsletter based in New York.</TE>
<TE>   He allows that stocks might soon stage a rally, as has occurred
several times over the last two years. But in an economy likely to
show moderate growth at best, and given the financial scandals and
terrorists threats also weighing on the market, Grant questions how
any rally can have staying power unless investors believe stocks are
truly cheap.</TE>
<TE>   Others say investors' collective mood will have to get
substantially worse--and many more people will have to bail out of
stocks--before prices can finally bottom. At least, that has been
true in the worst bear markets of the past.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think we're in this environment where people think
another bull market is right around the corner," said Kevin Marder,
strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann in Los Angeles. "What we need to see
is more people disgusted and believing that stocks will never come
back in their lifetimes."</TE>

<HD>A School Flails in a Sea of Chaos</HD>
<DH>Education: Abysmal test scores at L.A. campus draw state
'SWAT team,' which faces daunting odds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD LEE COLVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>   Dolores Torres, a 40-year-old bank teller, sat among about 150
parents in the auditorium of John C. Fremont High School, desperate
to ask the man from the state about her son.</LD>
<LD>   The boy sitting next to her, 15-year-old Ray Torres, dreamed of
going to college and becoming a computer programmer. But he was stuck
in this floundering Los Angeles high school, where most students
don't even reach their senior year, let alone collect a diploma. Test
scores had been so consistently abysmal that the state had sent a
"SWAT team" of auditors to figure out what, if anything, could be
done to raise them.</LD>
<LD>   On this November night, the state's chief emissary, Gordon
Jackson, stood at the front of the room, listening as parent after
parent rose to complain: Why wasn't this school giving them homework?
Why wasn't it teaching them to read? Where were all the books?</LD>
<TE>   Torres wanted answers too. Actually, she wanted to stop feeling,
every morning as she dropped off Ray, "like I was throwing him to the
wolves."</TE>
<TE>   When her turn came to speak, she managed to share just a fraction
of her frustration. So, as the meeting wound down, she and Ray
approached Jackson privately.</TE>
<TE>   Ray began by telling Jackson, in soft but enthusiastic tones, of
his plans for studying computers at USC. Then Dolores jumped in. What
about his geometry class? He's not learning anything. He's getting
all A's, but he has no homework, and the counselors won't help me.
What can you do?</TE>
<TE>   Jackson wondered what he could do--not just about Ray, but about
this school, one of 13 in California and 10 in the Los Angeles
Unified School District whose performance was so dismal that the
state had dispatched monitors like him. During this first weeklong
visit, he had told teachers, counselors, administrators and now,
parents, that the mission of his seven-member team was narrow--to
find some way to raise test scores that hadn't budged from the
basement in five years.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next 18 months, he had explained, the auditors would
negotiate a road map for improvement with L.A. Unified. After that,
if scores didn't rise enough, the state might try to run the school
directly or impose other sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   The state, prompted partly by federal pressure to turn around
failing schools, had never involved itself so intimately in the
affairs of individual campuses. Already, though, Jackson could see
that everyone associated with Fremont wanted--and needed--far more
than his team was offering.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the dismal test scores loomed widespread illiteracy,
overwhelming truancy, poor teacher training and morale, staff
infighting and an often-rudderless administration.</TE>
<TE>   "You say you don't have a magic wand," one counselor told Jackson
during a gripe session that first week. "But to us, you are the magic
wand."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson saw this less as a measure of optimism than of
desperation. Short of shutting down the place, he thought, "it would
take--oh, my God--a lot to fix this."</TE>
<TE>   On the night of the parents meeting, he couldn't summon the
reassurances Dolores Torres and her son were seeking.</TE>
<TE>   If I were you, he told Dolores, I'd be saying to myself, "I have
to make a change. I can't risk Ray's future."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Ray and Fremont, he said, "are not a match."</TE>
<TE>   Dolores Torres began looking for a new school for her son the
following day.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of 'Dropout Factories'</TE>
<TE>   In a nation whose president has vowed to "leave no child behind,"
Fremont High is filled with students who have been left, or soon will
be.</TE>
<TE>   It is among 300 or so high schools nationally that Robert Balfanz,
a Johns Hopkins University education researcher, refers to as
"dropout factories." More than two-thirds of Fremont ninth-graders
leave before reaching 12th grade.</TE>
<TE>   The school ranks in the lowest decile on the state's academic
performance index. About 80% of the almost entirely Latino and black
student body comes from what the state refers to as
socio-economically disadvantaged families. Most are poor; many aren't
proficient in English; most of their parents haven't graduated from
high school.</TE>
<TE>   On paper, Fremont is failing. Jackson, a 46-year-old retired
principal, went to the campus in November to judge for himself.</TE>
<TE>   Early one Monday, his first day on campus, the tall
visitor observed from the back of Room 312 as teacher Diane Adomian
wrapped up what appeared to be a standard first-grade lesson.</TE>
<TE>   "Al has a pal," Adomian read from a sheaf of papers, urging her
students to repeat after her.</TE>
<TE>   "Al has a pal," the 17 students intoned. "The pal has a tan hat,"
Adomian continued. The students parroted her.</TE>
<TE>   These youngsters were 14- and 15-year-old ninth-graders. This was
their "humanities" class.</TE>
<TE>   A pony-tailed girl wearing two earrings in her left ear turned to
Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all we do," she said. "I don't like this class. I'm
serious. I don't feel like I'm learning anything. It's just a waste
of time."</TE>
<TE>   Of Fremont High's many problems, Jackson and his team learned
quickly that reading topped the list. Nearly a third of the school's
2,300 freshmen read no better than third-graders. And test scores
suggested that 70% of Fremont's 4,600 students didn't understand what
they read.</TE>
<TE>   As teachers would explain to the auditors over and over,
youngsters who can't read can't learn at a high school level. So many
classes at Fremont--even honors classes--sidestepped reading by
relying on drills, oral reports, movies, picture books or art
projects such as collage- and poster-making.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers who arrived with high expectations learned to lower them.
Wendy Basgall, an English teacher and former attorney, came to
Fremont to "make a difference." But, in class, she couldn't expect
her students to actually read selections from Nathaniel Hawthorne and
18th century preacher Jonathan Edwards. So she read aloud to them.
Afterward, she had them make posters of the authors' fiery images.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to make do," Basgall said. "As my grandmother used to
say, 'We have to cut our coat to fit our cloth.' "</TE>
<TE>   That suited some Fremont students just fine. "It's easy,"
sophomore football player Stanley Claiborne told a reporter after
attending an English class where, as soothing classical music played
in the background, students paged through picture books. "I get an
A."</TE>
<TE>   The auditors found many other youngsters to be disengaged, unable
or unwilling to pay attention, do homework or even show up for class.</TE>
<TE>   In Adomian's humanities class, for example, nearly half of those
enrolled were absent the day Jackson visited. Auditors were told that
overall, on any given day, 700 to 800 students--about a sixth of
those enrolled--didn't show up for classes. Many milled about campus.</TE>
<TE>   Some students attributed their boredom to a dreaded ritual in many
Fremont classes known as "giving notes." It essentially means that
students copy what teachers write on the board.</TE>
<TE>   "If they'd be more interesting, kids would start going," Adrian de
la Cruz, 15, said of such courses.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Adrian, who was on campus but ditching his
classes, admitted his biggest problem to a reporter: He can't really
read.</TE>
<TE>   "Giving notes" was how teachers made do with students like him.</TE>
<TE>   A member of Jackson's team caught a glimpse of the technique in
Gary Taylor's 10th-grade world history class. Taylor told the
students to copy sentences related to "how scientific discoveries led
to new theories about the universe."</TE>
<TE>   The challenge was to fill in the blanks. To help, Taylor told the
class the first letter of the word he wanted them to fill in. Then he
told them what page in their textbooks the word was on. Then what
column on the page.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes, the auditor, Laurie Wiebold, had seen enough and
left the room.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor trotted after her. Only a handful of students can read the
textbooks, he explained; he has to find alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   "Yet we're supposed to get them ready for college," he said.
"Sounds like mission impossible."</TE>
<TE>   Fremont's campus sprawls across a city block, between San Pedro
Street and Avalon Boulevard in South-Central Los Angeles. It is a
neighborhood fortress, its perimeter protected by an 8-foot steel
fence topped by spikes, its windows shielded from gunfire by thick
screens.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the gates, a hodgepodge of buildings is clustered around a
shaded courtyard. At one end, on the gymnasium wall, is a mural of
the school's namesake, explorer John C. Fremont, boasting of
"Pathfinder Pride." The mural is marred by gang graffiti.</TE>
<TE>   Many Surprises Await School's New Principal</TE>
<TE>   Officially, it is Principal Margaret Roland's job to help this
school find a path to pride, or at least a path out of failure.</TE>
<TE>   She never expected to be in this position. Roland, who has been at
Fremont two years, was passed over for promotion to principal
numerous times during her 17 years as an assistant principal at
various Los Angeles schools. She was surprised when the district
asked her to apply for the top job at Fremont, and even more
surprised when she got it.</TE>
<TE>   Still more surprises awaited her.</TE>
<TE>   She learned upon arrival that she had 34 teaching vacancies out of
250 positions and that nearly half the school's teachers weren't
fully licensed. She also learned, gradually, of the school's
turbulent history--of student marches over the years protesting a
lack of books and advanced classes, and of long-standing discontent
among staff and teachers union members.</TE>
<TE>   "I hadn't paid attention to the walkouts or to anything else," she
recently recalled.</TE>
<TE>   She hadn't been told that the school was on a state "watch
list" for four years because of stubbornly low test scores. And so
she wasn't prepared for the news last fall that the school would be
audited by the state.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still trying to learn the names of teachers," Roland told a
reporter at the start of the audit. Jackson's team "will come up with
some things that I didn't know and wouldn't have known for a long
time."</TE>
<TE>   First, however, Jackson wanted to know what she thought. "It would
be absurd for us to think that you were just waiting for us to come
help you," he told her during their first sit-down meeting. What is
your vision for Fremont? What's in the works?</TE>
<TE>   Roland took a few minutes to detail the school's many problems,
then paused. "I don't know exactly where we're going," she said.
"Whatever it is you would have us do, our goal this year is to do
it."</TE>
<TE>   Auditor Believes That Students Deserve Better</TE>
<TE>   By the end of his first week on campus--and especially after his
meeting with Torres and the other parents--Jackson's team felt "blown
away."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, who was swarmed at times during the week by unhappy
students, believed that they deserved better than this.</TE>
<TE>   His own high school experience had opened up his world, expanded
his possibilities. Jackson, who is African American, grew up in Los
Angeles' Crenshaw Village apartments--known as "the Jungle." But he
had arranged to travel across the city, by bus, to attend largely
white Fairfax High on the Westside. There, he had run track, acted in
plays, grabbed every chance to learn something new.</TE>
<TE>   Fremont seemed to be doing the opposite of what Fairfax did for
him--shrinking students' opportunities and aspirations. School
officials, Jackson said, "were faltering right and left."</TE>
<TE>   Teachers and counselors, however, expected some guidance.</TE>
<TE>   On the Friday of the auditors' first week, they assembled in the
school auditorium, eager to hear Jackson's preliminary findings.</TE>
<TE>   He captured them on slides, eight in all, which he projected on a
screen: The reading program was "fragmented." Teachers expected
little of students. Teaching practices were misguided. The school's
administration was "overwhelmed" and ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   When he finished, the crowd didn't stir. They seemed stunned
to see, summed up neatly in black and white, the problems that had
weighed them down so long.</TE>
<TE>   "Would it be wrong for us to anticipate broad, systemic change at
Fremont High?" a social studies teacher finally asked.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said it would not, and the staff burst into applause.</TE>
<TE>   With the start of a new semester in January, Fremont had a plan.
But from the perspective of many staff members and students, nothing
changed.</TE>
<TE>   Two months after the auditors' departure, Roland called teachers
together in the cafeteria to present the road map for improvement
agreed upon by the district and the state.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than inspire, she begged.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here to beg, plead, whatever," she said, her voice reedy.
"There's so much to do, I can't begin to tell you."</TE>
<TE>   The plan was wide-ranging, requiring teachers to gear classes to
state standards and to prepare rigorous weekly lesson plans. They
were to be trained in proven techniques and monitored by
administrators. Students were to be engaged in "purposeful
activities" in language, arts and mathematics.</TE>
<TE>   Attendance was to be taken every period, discipline policies to be
revamped. Roland was to be assigned "a mentor."</TE>
<TE>   The principal admitted to teachers that she had work to do, but
insisted that much of what had to be done depended on them. She even
added her own requirements--not mentioned in the plan--that teachers,
for example, not bring food into classrooms because it attracts rats.</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, she said, teachers needed to stop being
naysayers. "We either do it and do it right, or the state will take
over," Roland told them.</TE>
<TE>   Many faculty members felt betrayed: The new remedies seemed
ridiculously weak and little different from those tried before. And
teachers, once again, appeared to be the scapegoats for the school's
failings.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like a fool, a total fool," said librarian Mary Hoover, an
unofficial leader among teachers and other staff. "We spilled our
guts to these people, and this is what we got."</TE>
<TE>   Ray Torres wasn't happy either. His own plans for
improvement--inspired by Jackson's advice--had stalled. His mother
still hadn't been able to get him into another high school.</TE>
<TE>   One day in February, he was headed for his fifth-period geometry
class, dreading the prospect. Though he loved math, every hour he
spent in this class at Fremont seemed to leave him further behind.</TE>
<TE>   As students filed in, geometry teacher Jeremy Kranz was writing a
problem requiring simple arithmetic on the board. Ray went to his
seat near the back and copied the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "I need you to look up here like this is the most important
thing in the world," said Kranz, growing frazzled as the buzz of
conversation in class grew louder.</TE>
<TE>   "We did this already!" one student protested. Others joined in.
Kranz seemed confused. "I don't think so," he said tentatively.</TE>
<TE>   Kranz asked for textbooks to be passed out so students could work
on their own. The books were only two years old but were marked up
throughout by gang symbols.</TE>
<TE>   Though Kranz had enough books for everyone to take home, he almost
never assigned homework. He said he knew most students wouldn't do
it.</TE>
<TE>   The noise grew louder.</TE>
<TE>   "Wait! Wait! Wait!" Kranz said. "Stop! Everybody stop! I'm not
perfect, but you've got to try!"</TE>
<TE>   Ray and a few others were working. One girl was asleep face-down
on her desk. A boy with spiked hair was listening to his CD player.
Another girl peered into a mirror, plucking her eyebrows. Her cell
phone rang, and she answered it.</TE>
<TE>   Ray asked about a problem--how to know whether two triangles are
similar--and Kranz answered by writing on the board with little
explanation.</TE>
<TE>   Kenyon Brown, a football player sitting up front, badgered Kranz
for a hall pass. Eventually, he got it and left the room with a
friend. It was only 20 minutes into the period, but they wouldn't
return.</TE>
<TE>   "I skip his class just about every day," Brown said later. "Mr.
Kranz tries, but he just can't control us."</TE>
<TE>   Inside the classroom, Kranz told a reporter that he wants the
school to look good to the state. Things are better than they used to
be, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The current administration is the best we've ever had. We're all
just working under difficult conditions."</TE>
<TE>   To illustrate, he called on a student. "Jeremy, what's 10 minus
1/2?"</TE>
<TE>   "Five?" Jeremy replied, uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "See!" Kranz said, his voice faltering. "This is what we're
dealing with."</TE>
<TE>   Tears spilled from his eyes. "We're all trying so hard," he said.
"And yet the state comes in and says we're not teaching right."</TE>
<TE>   One Student Seeks Education Elsewhere</TE>
<TE>   By spring, Ray was gone.</TE>
<TE>   Dolores Torres finally had persuaded his former high school, Mark
Keppel in Alhambra, to take him back, even though he lived in Los
Angeles, outside the school's boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't that no one at Fremont taught him anything. He
would miss Mario Becerra's English class, for example, where kids
competed to be called on and sometimes stayed late to delve a little
deeper into the meaning of a short story.</TE>
<TE>   But even Becerra said Keppel would be better for Ray. "We can't
hold him back," the former bank executive said after learning Ray was
leaving.</TE>
<TE>   At his new school, Ray noticed with relief, students lugged
backpacks full of books and crammed between classes.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, you can actually hear the teacher speak," he told a
reporter. "And the students actually worry about their grades."</TE>
<TE>   Ray was worried too. He had fallen behind at Fremont, not just in
history and French, but in math, his favorite subject.</TE>
<TE>   At Keppel, the academic bar was far higher. About 120 students
were taking Advanced Placement calculus--a course Ray would almost
certainly need to be admitted to a top computer science program.</TE>
<TE>   Nine in 10 Keppel students who took the AP exam last year passed
it. At Fremont, twice as big a school, no one had passed it--ever.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Ray was focused on geometry. In April, he earned his
first A on a quiz. By early June, he was hoping to raise his overall
grade to a C-plus.</TE>
<TE>   On the Fremont campus 16 miles away, progress was less certain.</TE>
<TE>   During an April visit, Jackson's team had found the school lagging
behind the state's expectations in five of six major areas: academic
standards, teacher preparation and training, school leadership,
security, and parent and community involvement. The school was found
to be "progressing satisfactorily" in its improvement of teaching
practices.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the district has announced plans to raise academic
standards by moving to a "block schedule" in which classes would meet
every other day for an intensive two hours.</TE>
<TE>   But a vocal minority of teachers balked, saying they weren't
consulted.</TE>
<TE>   They organized a student walkout, cursed district administrators
to their faces and picketed at the school's gates.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the district softened somewhat, proposing to phase in the
block schedules by September 2003.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Jackson arrived for his final visit of the school year.</TE>
<TE>   The day began inauspiciously, with an explosion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the firecrackers," a teacher told Jackson matter-of-factly.
For two weeks, nearly every day, a prankster had been setting them
off near a girls bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson proceeded to drop in on classes, looking hard for signs of
improvement.</TE>
<TE>   And he found some.</TE>
<TE>   "That had a nice tone to it!" he said enthusiastically after
attending a class in which a young teacher was discussing
Shakespearean literary devices.</TE>
<TE>   In an algebra class, the students seemed engaged as a teacher
explained the formula for working with parabolas. To Jackson, it
"seemed like a real high school class."</TE>
<TE>   But this was hardly a campus transformed. He observed a history
teacher reading a newspaper as students did fill-in-the-blank work
sheets. Another instructor gestured and whispered to students during
a lesson clearly staged for the auditor's benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Bands of youngsters continued to wander campus during class time.
The school's tardy policy was not being enforced. Attendance remained
poor.</TE>
<TE>   A young drama teacher stopped Jackson in the courtyard. She said
she was being pressured by administrators to pass kids who had been
absent as many as 18 of 28 days. She had been at Fremont only two
months but was ready to quit. Another faculty member reported that a
dozen teachers in the English department were thinking of leaving
too.</TE>
<TE>   Though only six months into this 18-month rescue effort, Jackson
knew Fremont was running short on time. He wasn't concerned so much
about this year's test scores--the exam had been taken in the spring,
just a few months into the audit--but next year's results were key.
The numbers needed to go up.</TE>
<TE>   He tried to remain upbeat. "In an environment like this," he told
teachers he met with near the end of the day, "we need to find five
things we can do well .... I think we stand a chance of making some
of these things work, if we work together."</TE>
<TE>   But Hoover, the librarian whom many teachers looked up to, felt
that the faculty had made the mistake of hoping for too much.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been very disillusioning," she said of the state's
involvement in Fremont. "We expected a lot more than we should have,
and when we didn't get it, a lot of us gave up."</TE>

<CX>   Advanced Placement exam--An article in Section A on July 14 about
Fremont High School in Los Angeles erroneously reported that no
students from Fremont had ever passed the Advanced Placement calculus
exam. In fact, 19 students over the last five years have received
scores on that test of three, four or five, according to the Los
Angeles Unified School District. Scores of three and above earn
college credit, and five is the highest score possible.</CX>

<HD>Those Who Knew LAX Killer Say Personal Agenda Died With Him</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON, JACK LEONARD and RICH CONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A decade ago, Hesham Hadayet left behind a comfortable life and
upper-class family in Egypt, gambling that a six-month tourist visa
was his ticket to prosperity, American-style.</LD>
<LD>   From the beginning, Hadayet took chances--first as a cab driver
and later with his own business. He worked illegally. He overstayed
the visa and applied for asylum. He bought a limousine he didn't know
how to drive.</LD>
<LD>   "He told me how he landed at LAX" to begin his new life, recalled
acquaintance Bob Milstead. "He took a cab, and it was expensive, and
he thought, 'Wow! I'm going to get into this. You can make a lot of
money.' "</LD>
<TE>   For a while, luck seemed to be with him. He avoided deportation
when his wife won a lottery for permanent residency. He worked up to
a two-limousine service and hired help. He lived with his wife and
two sons in Irvine, the classic Southern California suburb. He was
known as a quiet, observant Muslim who wanted people to believe he
was running a successful business.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the long hours, success was elusive. In recent months,
Hadayet's business teetered on the edge of collapse. He couldn't keep
up with his liability insurance and his wife began asking neighbors
for baby-sitting work.</TE>
<TE>   For all of that, Hadayet did little to suggest he might some day
walk up to a Los Angeles International Airport ticket counter and
start shooting people.</TE>
<TE>   Yet that's just what he did on the Fourth of July. Authorities say
Hadayet killed El Al ticket agent Victoria Hen, 25, of Chatsworth and
Yaakov Aminov, 46, of Valley Village before he was killed by an El Al
security guard.</TE>
<TE>   "We all thought it was someone else and they blamed it on Hesham,"
said Tarek Oraby, 35, a Cairo native and former cab driver living in
Garden Grove. "Nobody believes it .... People are asking, did he go
crazy?"</TE>
<TE>   In interviews with dozens of neighbors, business acquaintances and
family members in Southern California and Cairo, the emerging
consensus is that Hadayet was an ordinarily religious man with little
appetite for politics, who opened fire at the El Al Israel Airlines
ticket counter following a personal agenda that died with him.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone is going to do a terrorist act, they wouldn't park
their car, then walk minutes to a terminal and then stand in line
before they shoot someone," said Medhat Mahmoud, a Los Angeles
produce wholesaler and a former security official for Egypt Air who
had known Hadayet since 1992. "It's ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   As investigators begin to believe that Hadayet was simply an
overstressed man who snapped, Hadayet's family refuses to accept any
conclusion beyond the fact that Hadayet is dead.</TE>
<TE>   Family Awaits Outcome</TE>
<TE>   "All I want to know is: What will be the outcome of the
investigation?" Hadayet's widow, Hala Mohammed Sadeq al Awadly, said
in Cairo, where she and the couple's young sons have been vacationing
since mid-June. "And from the investigation we should know exactly
what happened and then we will know what the truth is."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Egypt on July 4, 1961, Hadayet grew up in a politically
and religiously moderate family in Cairo's middle-class Abbasiya
neighborhood, where he attended the private St. George's School
before earning a degree in commerce from Cairo's Ain Shams University
in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   The son and nephew of Egyptian military brass, Hadayet was
exempted from military service as his family's only son and embarked
on a promising career at the Misr Iran Bank. By 30, he was chief of
the securities and credit division, a job that usually goes to men in
their mid-40s and older, relatives said.</TE>
<TE>   Given that success, why he chose to move to the United States is
unclear. One American acquaintance said Hadayet suggested his tenure
at the bank ended badly. "He had to leave Egypt because he was in
trouble there for some accounting thing he did," said Milstead, who
runs the Newport Beach-based limo service, Executive Transportation.
"He said he was framed."</TE>
<TE>   Hadayet's family denied he had a problem with the bank, and said
his emigration grew from a years-long yearning to live in America. He
first visited on a tourist visa in 1981, and signed up for a Social
Security card at the agency's Wilshire Boulevard office even though
his visa did not allow him to work.</TE>
<TE>   "Since he was 13 or 14 he wanted to go to America," said Emad al
Abd, 45, a cousin in Cairo. "He used to say, 'It's a beautiful
country.' He was like any young man, dreaming of a good life in the
States."</TE>
<TE>   Hadayet met his future wife at the bank. Awadly's father owned a
clothing business and she regularly deposited checks for the company.</TE>
<TE>   The couple complemented each other. Where Hadayet was quiet, calm
and serious, Awadly was outgoing and talkative. About 1985, the
couple married and moved in with her parents in a seventh-floor
apartment in a middle-class neighborhood of Cairo as they awaited
construction of an apartment Hadayet had bought elsewhere in the
city.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, the couple's first son, Omar, was born. Two years later,
his cousin said, Hadayet left for America, following both his dream
and the urging of an American-born boss at the bank. A few months
later he sent for his wife and son.</TE>
<TE>   "He was just traveling there to work. He was thinking he would go
there and see how things went," said Abd. "He didn't need to go to
the States because his financial position here was very secure. Why
go if you don't need to go? He already had such a good job so he
would have risen so high if he'd stayed here."</TE>
<TE>   Hadayet arrived on a six-month visitor's visa and apparently began
working in violation of its terms. He applied for political
asylum--allowing him to work--as the visa neared its expiration. The
asylum application was rejected, but Hadayet was allowed to stay
while he appealed.</TE>
<TE>   His wife gave birth to a second son, Adam, at Saddleback Memorial
Medical Center in Laguna Hills in June 1995. Two years later, as
Hadayet faced deportation, she was granted permanent residency for
the family through a routine Immigration and Naturalization Service
lottery. A month later, Hadayet started his limousine business.</TE>
<TE>   Like many immigrants, Hadayet had trouble adjusting to his new
life, Abd said.</TE>
<TE>   Adjustment Was Hard</TE>
<TE>   "He had to start all over again. It was difficult to begin with.
It was not what he expected when he left a bank here in Egypt to go
to the States," Abd said. "It's hard when you feel you've gone down,
but he insisted on sticking with it. He said it was quite difficult
but he got used to it."</TE>
<TE>   At first, Hadayet worked part-time at a Bank of America office in
Mission Viejo, said Mahmoud, the produce dealer. Bank of America
officials, though, said they could find no record of Hadayet having
worked there.</TE>
<TE>   Needing extra income, Hadayet also began working as a cab driver,
Mahmoud said.</TE>
<TE>   But just a few days after starting the job, Hadayet was robbed.
Mahmoud recalls telling his new friend that if he was going to
continue to drive a cab, he should arm himself. Police say Hadayet
was the registered owner of two guns--but "whether he took my advice
then, I don't know,'' Mahmoud said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hadayet was well known in the tight world of airport
cabbies, few of his colleagues ever got beyond cursory conversations.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very quiet," said Mike Parvinnia, who coordinates cabs
outside John Wayne Airport. ''He never said hello or goodbye. I know
those people very well. I know them better than their fathers and
mothers. But this guy, I didn't know him."</TE>
<TE>   Hadayet quit as a cabby in 1997 to start a limousine business
serving local companies. He dressed the part, invariably wearing dark
suits behind the wheel, and even as he washed his vehicles outside
the family's apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "He seemed to be very ambitious, conscientious," said John
Henningsen, a broker who sold Hadayet his business insurance in 1998
and 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "He had big plans for his limousine company. He wanted to go
places with it."</TE>
<TE>   Henningsen said Hadayet, whom he described as upbeat and
determined to succeed, thought he could mine the high-tech industries
near his Irvine home. "He was trying to break in and get contracts
for the people from out of town going to visit these high-tech
companies," Henningsen said.</TE>
<TE>   Hadayet bought a 28-foot limousine in November 1998, putting
$3,000 down on the $30,000 vehicle and agreeing to $1,225 monthly
payments.</TE>
<TE>   Virgil Budnic, a limousine salesman, went with Hadayet to pick up
the limo in Brentwood.</TE>
<TE>   Budnic said Hadayet assured him he knew how to drive a stretch
limousine, but then ripped a long gash on the passenger side when he
hit a pole moments after slipping behind the wheel.</TE>
<TE>   "He was not a very good driver," Budnic said. "Apparently he had
no idea how to maneuver the car ... of course he was very upset, and
embarrassed."</TE>
<TE>   Hadayet's business appeared to be growing in 1999, when he added a
second vehicle, and for a time employed one or two other drivers. But
any success faded fast. In 2000, he listed himself as his firm's only
driver. State Public Utility Commission records show that Hadayet's
liability insurance came close to being canceled several times before
he was finally dropped in November 2001 for nonpayment.</TE>
<TE>   The insurance cancellation should have kept him off the road, but
fellow drivers and neighbors said Hadayet was still working. When
asked, Hadayet rarely acknowledged that his business was having
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Abdallatef Aboulzahab, 36, a Syrian immigrant, worked for Hadayet
in 2000 for less than a year before he was fired in what he described
as a dispute over tips.</TE>
<TE>   Aboulzahab said the bulk of Hadayet's fares were business people
flying into the area for meetings. Hadayet, he said, spent hours
trying to drum up additional clients and complained about overhead
costs.</TE>
<TE>   "He operated the whole company by himself," Aboulzahab said. "He
did the maintenance himself. He's always on the computer trying to
get more customers. Business was slow .... One time he told me, 'I
pay $1,800 every month just to keep those cars on the street.' "</TE>
<TE>   Violence Was a Surprise</TE>
<TE>   While Hadayet occasionally mentioned a hatred for Israel,
Aboulzahab saw it more as a cultural perspective on Mideast politics
than an emotion that would fuel violence.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Aboulzahab recalled a conversation in which Hadayet
segued from annoyance at customers who stiffed him on fares into
complaints about Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me he'd do what he was supposed to do and people would
not pay him," Aboulzahab said.</TE>
<TE>   Hadayet then said Americans ''were the No. 1 complainers in the
world. He told me, 'When they complain, they get everything they
want. When we complain as Arabs, nobody listens.' ''</TE>
<TE>   Aboulzahab said Hadayet watched Arabic news on the satellite
television station Al Jazeera and was upset about turmoil in the
Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   "He blamed Israel for what was going on over there.... He had
nothing against Americans.... He's not hateful for the American
people on the street.... He loved this country. He loved freedom of
speech. He told me, 'I'd like to be a U.S. citizen. I like to pay my
taxes. I want to raise my children here.' ''</TE>
<TE>   Hadayet's business troubles deepened with the recession and the
sharp drop in business travel after the Sept. 11 terror attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "After 9/11, business was really bad," Milstead said. "He was over
at my office and we were talking. He said the government was really
stupid going after Osama bin Laden and that by the time they found
out who it really was it would be too late."</TE>
<TE>   As a limo driver, Hadayet's hours were long and late, and the time
he spent at home was largely indoors, out of sight--and earshot--of
neighbors of the family's two-bedroom Irvine apartment. Although
sometimes harsh with his family and unforgiving with his neighbors,
Hadayet was not seen as a physical threat, just a difficult man who
didn't fit in.</TE>
<TE>   In May 1996, Irvine police were summoned to the Hadayet apartment,
where Hadayet and his wife each accused the other of assault. Police
noted no signs of violence and prosecutors took no action. Last week,
Awadly downplayed the incident as a marital spat that grew out of
proportion and said her husband was not a violent man.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors viewed Hadayet as a strict father and Awadly a
protective mother, while their sons were seen as typical American
suburban kids, playing soccer and video games, riding skateboards and
trading baseball cards, and occasionally talking their parents into
giving their friends rides in the limousine.</TE>
<TE>   To Hadayet's wife, the family's life was unremarkable, and Hadayet
was a hard-working provider.</TE>
<TE>   "He was correct, a perfectly decent Egyptian person," Awadly said
earlier this week. "He loves his children and his neighbors and his
family and his friends. He is a normal person who goes from work to
home and that's it. A normal person. There is nothing to suggest he
was a bad person or that he belonged to any groups."</TE>
<TE>   Issa Ziadeh, 43, had a similar view of Hadayet. The men shared
heritages--both were Egyptian-born Muslims--and had similar jobs.
Ziadeh is an airport shuttle driver.</TE>
<TE>   He said he last saw Hadayet during evening prayers July 3 at a
Garden Grove mosque, when Ziadeh accidentally turned off a small lamp
Hadayet was using to read the Koran.</TE>
<TE>   "He came up to me, very cool, very joking, and he said, 'I knew it
would have had to have been some Egyptian who turned my light off,' "
Ziadeh said. "He was very relaxed."</TE>
<TE>   The two men exchanged small talk, prayed together and then went
their separate ways.</TE>
<TE>   A few hours later--early morning in California--Hadayet called his
family in Egypt to mark his birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing his suit one last time, Hadayet armed himself with a
knife, two guns and extra ammunition, and made his way to LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Half a world away, Awadly's grief is infused with a wife's sense
of guilt.</TE>
<TE>   "I came here for two months, just for the summer," she said, her
voice breaking. "It has been the worst two months of my life. If I
had been with Hesham in the U.S., this might never have happened."</TE>

<LD>Chief Medical Examiner Jonathan L. Arden said he believes Chandra
Levy may have been strangled, though he doesn't have conclusive
evidence to rule it as the cause of death.</LD>
<LD>   Levy's skeletal remains, discovered May 22 in Rock Creek Park,
showed damage to her hyoid, a small U-shaped bone in the upper neck,
he said.</LD>
<LD>   Law enforcement officials suspect that Levy, a former Washington
intern from Modesto, Calif., who disappeared in May 2001, was
sexually assaulted, because her leggings were discovered turned
inside out, with each leg knotted.</LD>

<LD>US Airways and its pilots union announced they had tentatively
cleared obstacles to a cost-cutting plan aimed at resuscitating the
struggling airline, moving the carrier closer to meeting conditions
for a potentially lifesaving loan.</LD>
<LD>   The pilots already have agreed to a 26% pay cut. Under the final
negotiations, they would receive a 20% equity stake in the company
and a union member seat on the company's board of directors, said Roy
Freundlich, an Air Line Pilots Assn. representative. But they would
forgo furlough protections, giving the company latitude to let more
pilots go, he added.</LD>
<LD>   The plan must be approved in a union vote.</LD>

<LD>Hoping to avoid a repeat of the 2000 election debacle, Palm Beach
County held a mock election to test its touch-screen vote machines.</LD>
<LD>   At shopping malls and supermarkets across the county, nearly 4,000
residents voted on such topics as favorite holiday, best president
and favorite patriotic landmark. About 73% of voters said the words
"under God" should stay in the Pledge of Allegiance.</LD>
<LD>   A collection of congressmen pushed for a mock election to test the
machines, but Saturday's election amounted only to a demonstration,
not a measure of their accuracy.</LD>

<HD>Mother Left Girl's Body to Decompose at Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HARVEY, Ill.</DL>
<LD>The body of a girl who had cerebral palsy was found decomposing in
her bed weeks after a state agency stopped visits to the family
because it considered her safe from harm and neglect.</LD>
<LD>   An initial investigation indicated Shanecia McClellan, 9, died of
natural causes, the medical examiner's office said. Her body was
found Thursday, two or three days after she died.</LD>
<LD>   The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services said it
will investigate its handling of the family's case. Shanecia's three
siblings have been placed in foster care.</LD>
<TE>   Katina McClellan, 26, Shanecia's mother, told police she could not
wake Shanecia on Wednesday, but she could not explain why she did not
call authorities, Det. Sam Ward said.</TE>
<TE>   "She didn't know how to handle it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The child services agency started a case in 1999 after finding
that Shanecia was medically neglected, said John Goad, deputy
director for child protection. The girl had severe cerebral palsy,
with no muscle or speech control, and had a history of seizures.</TE>
<TE>   The agency helped transfer her medical records to a hospital
closer to the McClellans' neighborhood and helped install a phone in
their home so emergency medical help could be summoned if needed.</TE>
<TE>   In April 2001, McClellan gave birth to twins who tested positive
for cocaine, Goad said. The agency visited her home 33 times, and
McClellan passed each of eight random drug tests, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The agency closed the case in June after determining there was no
risk of harm to the children, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have some very serious concerns about our handling of the
case," Goad said. "It's just terribly disturbing to us to see a child
die after our having been as intensely involved with her as recently
as we were."</TE>
<TE>   The case has similarities to cases in Florida, whose child
protection agency has faced months of criticism and calls for reform.</TE>
<TE>   A caseworker in Polk County, Fla., was fired Friday and charged
with falsifying records after allegedly lying about a home visit to
check out an abuse complaint. Alfredo Montez, 2, was killed July 1,
the day the caseworker wrote that she visited his family.</TE>
<TE>   In April, the Florida agency reported 5-year-old Rilya Wilson
missing and acknowledged that it lost track of her for 15 months. She
is still missing.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DURANGO, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Fumes from an illegal landfill sickened firefighters at a wildfire in
southwest Colorado and could contaminate a river, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Firefighters found the dump two weeks ago under a dam on land
owned by the federal Bureau of Reclamation.</LD>
<LD>   Six firefighters were treated at a hospital after breathing yellow
smoke from the dump, said Wano Urbonas, environmental health director
for the San Juan Basin Health Department.</LD>
<TE>   The firefighters were battling two blazes near Durango that burned
71,000 acres. Durango is about 380 miles southwest of Denver.</TE>
<TE>   The dump is on a steep hillside burned by the fire, and rain could
wash contaminants into a creek that flows into the Pine River,
Urbonas said.</TE>
<TE>   Urbonas said the bureau agreed to clean up the dump on June 28 but
hadn't done so. He sent a violation notice Friday, giving the bureau
10 days to hire an environmental consultant and clean the site.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Martin, the Bureau of Reclamation official assigned to the
case, did not immediately return calls.</TE>

<HD>Small Firms Elude Suits for Bias in Conn. Ruling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In April 1997, Nicole Thibodeau went to work as a secretary and
receptionist at a small architectural firm in Chester, Conn. Just
before Christmas, she told her employers she was pregnant. Four
months later, she was fired.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a Friday, 15 minutes before the end of the day. I had no
warning at all," she recalled.</LD>
<LD>   "I was so upset. I was 7 1/2 months pregnant. It was so
overwhelming."</LD>
<TE>   After the birth of her son, Thibodeau hired a lawyer, claiming she
was wrongfully terminated because of her pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, by a 3-2 vote, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled
against Thibodeau, upholding the right of companies with fewer than
three employees to fire a pregnant woman. On Friday, lawyers for
Thibodeau filed papers asking all seven justices on the court to
reconsider the case, which has focused attention on little-known
exceptions to legal safeguards many workers take for granted.</TE>
<TE>   Federal anti-discrimination law protects workers at companies with
more than 15 employees. But more than 30 states go further, affording
protections to workers at even smaller firms. Connecticut provides
remedies for workers at companies with three or more employees.
According to the Census Bureau, 2.7 million people work for
businesses with fewer than five employees.</TE>
<TE>   The Connecticut judges based their finding on a law passed in 1947
and significantly amended in 1967 that excludes tiny businesses from
suits alleging sexual or pregnancy discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   "The Legislature did not wish to subject this state's smallest
employers to the significant burdens, financial and otherwise,
associated with the defense of employment discrimination claims,"
Justice Richard N. Palmer wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Legislature expressly has chosen to say this protection
applies when you work for a certain size firm, there is a real
question whether a court should go beyond what the Legislature has
done," said Christine Jolls, a professor at Harvard Law School and an
employment law scholar.</TE>
<TE>   "On the other hand, obviously morally, we do think discrimination
is wrong, and we don't think the moral wrongness goes away because
you are working for a small firm that is exempt."</TE>
<TE>   "It is a genuinely hard question," she added.</TE>
<TE>   In California, anti-discrimination law applies only to firms with
five or more employees, but some lawyers said it is still not clear
whether a suit similar to Thibodeau's could be brought successfully
against an exempt company.</TE>
<TE>   "A worker may argue that ... the state's anti-discrimination
statute and the California constitution suggest that such conduct
would violate the state's public policy," said Joseph Beachboard, a
partner with the law firm of Ogletree Deakins in Los Angeles and
editor of the California Employment Law Letter. "The question is,
will the courts expand on the statute and broaden the prohibition of
this type of discrimination to include smaller employers."</TE>
<TE>   Alleging unlawful discharge, Thibodeau's lawyers sued Design Group
One Architects, charging that her bosses illegally discriminated
against her on the basis of gender.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, only a woman can get pregnant," said Elaine Rubinson,
a lawyer for Thibodeau. "It is such an important right women have....
It is a major, major issue."</TE>
<TE>   She contended that the ruling gives small employers "unfettered
power to discriminate, sexually harass and discriminate not just upon
gender, but upon race."</TE>
<TE>   Erin Boggs, a lawyer representing the Connecticut Civil Liberties
Union, which filed a brief on Thibodeau's behalf, said: "This isn't
just a Connecticut case. This is an issue all around the country."</TE>
<TE>   Thibodeau, a 23-year-old single mother, had a difficult pregnancy
requiring extra medical appointments, which caused her to leave her
job early at times. She and her lawyer said she stayed late other
days to make up the work.</TE>
<TE>   Her doctors worried she would give birth to a child with Down's
syndrome, a genetic abnormality that causes mental retardation. The
concern proved to be correct.</TE>
<TE>   Thibodeau's lawyers charged in their complaint that she was highly
praised in an evaluation three months after joining the firm and
received a raise.</TE>
<TE>   But after she told her bosses she was pregnant, the lawyers said
the firm's principals suddenly began to criticize her performance.
One became "visibly angry" when Thibodeau told him she needed to
leave work earlier than usual a few times because of medical tests,
according to her complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the architectural firm countered that pregnancy wasn't
the reason for Thibodeau's dismissal.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that tends to get lost in the public discussion
is, Design Group One adamantly denies that she was terminated because
of her pregnancy. It was because of performance issues," said Michael
D. O'Connell, a lawyer for the architects.</TE>
<TE>   The differing views were never decided by a jury. In March 2000, a
trial court dismissed the case, ruling that the Connecticut law
prohibiting employment discrimination because of pregnancy applies
only to companies with three or more workers.</TE>
<TE>   After an appeals court reversed the judgment and ruled that
Thibodeau could file a lawsuit, lawyers for the architectural company
appealed to the Connecticut Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Ruling against Thibodeau, Palmer said the court was "precluded
from substituting its own ideas of what might be wise policy in place
of a clear expression of legislative will."</TE>
<TE>   "In sum, we see no reason why the Legislature would have excluded
small employers from the act unless it had decided, as a matter of
policy, that such employers should be shielded from liability for
employment discrimination, including sex and pregnancy-related
discrimination," Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   The justice added, however, that Connecticut's Legislature "may
wish to revisit its policy judgment regarding small employers."</TE>
<TE>   The Connecticut Civil Liberties Union plans to lobby the
Legislature to change the law.</TE>
<TE>   In the four years since she filed her suit, Thibodeau had a second
son--who is free from birth defects--and found another job. She was
voted employee of the year at the property management company where
she is an administrative assistant.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pregnant on the job during the whole year I won the award,"
she said. "My job now has much more responsibility than what I did at
the design firm.... My bosses are very happy with my work."</TE>

<HD>Wildfires Burn a Large Hole in the Forest Service's Pockets</HD>
<DH>Finances: The agency's funds for battling blazes are nearly
$650 million short, with more acreage lost than in previous years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Forest Service estimates that it will spend $966 million
this year fighting forest fires--far more than the $321 million the
agency had been allocated for this year's fire season.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, the agency's top forester has asked that
discretionary spending be curtailed until costs stabilize or extra
funds become available.</LD>
<LD>   In an internal memo sent to regional foresters, station directors
and other Forest Service personnel last week, Chief Dale N. Bosworth
wrote that the agency's funds for fighting fires "are at their lowest
level in recent years" and no additional funds appeared to be
forthcoming. Bosworth asked foresters to avoid incurring additional
financial obligations "wherever possible."</LD>
<TE>   He suggested that Forest Service managers save money by
rescheduling or deferring noncritical travel and projects. But
Bosworth's directive also means the agency will have to refrain from
activities that are central to the Forest Service's mission, such as
obligating funds for more parkland.</TE>
<TE>   Jody Cook, supervisor of the Angeles National Forest in Southern
California, said that, under the directive, the Angeles will curtail
most discretionary spending, including travel and training. "It's a
guessing game," Cook said. "We won't know the final bill until
October," when the new fiscal year begins.</TE>
<TE>   According to Forest Service spokeswoman Heidi Valetkevitch,
officials look at their budget numbers "on an almost daily basis"
during fire season. The directive was issued after they realized,
halfway through the fire season, that nationally, more acreage had
burned this year than in 2000, which Valetkevitch called a "banner
year for forest fires."</TE>
<TE>   At its peak, the recent Rodeo-Chediski fire in Arizona cost $8
million a day to fight; costs on the Hayman fire in Colorado ran more
than $1 million a day.</TE>
<TE>   The Interior Department and Federal Emergency Management Agency
will pay some of the costs of fighting those and other fires, but the
$966-million estimate of firefighting costs is for Forest Service
spending alone.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service is the nation's largest wildfire-fighting
outfit, employing more than 10,000 people to battle blazes.</TE>
<TE>   Valetkevitch said the agency expects to be reimbursed in the 2003
budget appropriations now underway for the extra funds needed to
fight this year's fires. President Bush's 2003 budget, she said,
requests $420.6 million for Forest Service fire-suppression
operations.</TE>
<TE>   "We have always been reimbursed in the past, and we will ask for
and expect to get reimbursed," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "But we fully expect to meet our fire-suppression needs."</TE>

<HD>At Conference, Governors Tackle Soaring Costs of Health
Care</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOISE, Idaho</DL>
<LD>The nation's governors opened their summer meeting Saturday with an
eye toward shoring up faltering state economies by taking aim at
their biggest budgetary albatross: the mounting cost of health care.</LD>
<LD>   "Last year was pretty trying for the nation's governors," Michigan
Gov. John Engler said as he launched the four-day National Governors'
Assn. conference.</LD>
<LD>   "We've had to battle declining tax revenues ... and at the same
time there's been an explosion in health-care costs. Boy, are they
ever back," said Engler, the Republican chairman of the association.</LD>
<TE>   Thirty governors are meeting in Boise while their states face dire
economic conditions. More than 40 states suffered budget shortfalls
altogether of $40 billion to $50 billion in the last fiscal year,
leading to deep cuts, depleted emergency funds and some layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Despite signs of a gradual national recovery, the states' woes are
expected to persist well into the current fiscal cycle.</TE>
<TE>   Their biggest problems are the ballooning costs of prescription
drugs and Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for
the poor. Medicaid spending jumped 13% in the last fiscal year and
makes up 20% of state budgets.</TE>
<TE>   Governors will consider a proposal that calls on Congress to pick
up a greater share of the Medicaid bill. A Senate measure would
provide $8.9 billion more in Medicaid money to states over the next
18 months.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're looking for is to get through this current downturn
without making dramatic and really hurtful cuts in education and
basic social services," said Kentucky Gov. Paul E. Patton, the
association's Democratic vice chairman.</TE>
<TE>   The chief executives also hope to increase affordability and
availability of prescription drugs under Medicare, the federal health
insurance program for the elderly.</TE>
<TE>   The House last month approved legislation to spend $320 billion
over 10 years to provide a prescription drug benefit for senior
citizens.</TE>
<TE>   The measure would gradually federalize drug costs for about 7
million seniors eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, meaning a
possible $38 billion in savings for the states.</TE>
<TE>   However, the governors acknowledged that the likelihood of final
action on either front is uncertain while the White House is facing
its own budget problems.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration said Friday that the government would run
a $165-billion deficit in the federal fiscal year ending Sept. 30.
That's $59 billion worse than the administration estimated in
February.</TE>
<TE>   "The same things that are causing those deficits in Washington are
precisely what's responsible at the state level for the problems we
have, but there's one difference," Engler said. "We've got to balance
state budgets."</TE>
<TE>   He said he was confident that President Bush would support the
governors' priorities, but some Democratic chief executives were less
sure.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a serious issue that the states can't deal with, and
Congress and the president need to focus on it," Alabama Gov. Donald
Siegelman said. "But you don't do that by running around the country
campaigning on partisan politics. Unfortunately, this is an election
year."</TE>
<TE>   Other topics on the governors' agenda include homeland security,
air quality and expanding economic development.</TE>
<TE>   And while it's not likely to dominate any public discussions, the
subject of corporate fraud also has chief executives weighing in.</TE>
<TE>   Engler said that while the governors support legislation that
cracks down on corporate wrongdoing, he is worried that the scandal
could overshadow the states' fiscal concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "When we're talking about Washington and fighting for time on the
national agenda, you think about how much time this is taking," he
said, adding that the goal of this meeting is to ensure the states
"don't get left at the altar."</TE>

<HD>Why Investigation of Bush's Stock Sale 'Just Didn't Pan
Out'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK FINEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>What Lisa Meulbroek best remembers about the day in 1990 when she
handed her four-page report to two young enforcement lawyers at the
Securities and Exchange Commission was their disappointment.</LD>
<LD>   Meulbroek was working in the SEC's Office of Economic Analysis at
the time. Fresh out of MIT, she had just done her doctoral
dissertation on insider stock trading. The SEC lawyers, excited about
a hot insider-trading case they had been pursuing for several months,
had asked her to analyze trading patterns in a small Texas
oil-and-gas exploration company.</LD>
<LD>   Their target: George W. Bush, son of the president of the United
States.</LD>
<TE>   "There was just this sense among the enforcement lawyers that this
was going to be an opportunity for them to have a fairly high-profile
case," Meulbroek, who now teaches corporate finance at MIT, recalled
in an interview Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "And it just didn't pan out."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Meulbroek's report was instrumental in turning the tide in
Bush's favor 11 years ago this month--a watershed moment that helps
explain why, after four months of investigation by apparently gung-ho
lawyers, the SEC closed the case on Bush's sale of 212,140 shares of
Harken Energy Corp. Bush was a director of Harken.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC did not exculpate Bush. Rather, its investigating
attorneys concluded only that they lacked sufficient evidence to
prosecute him for illegality or fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Meulbroek's analysis determined that a critical event necessary to
justify civil or criminal charges of insider trading simply hadn't
happened: Harken's stock price did not collapse, as investigators
thought it had, when the company announced a record $23.2-million
loss two months after Bush's stock sale.</TE>
<TE>   Until today, not even Meulbroek is certain just why the stock
didn't tank--one of the enduring mysteries in the case. But she and
others who were then at the SEC say that her July 7, 1991, conclusion
was the beginning of the end of the enforcement division's File No.
MHO-3180, the SEC's investigation of George W. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   A detailed review of more than a dozen internal SEC memos and
letters and hundreds of pages of Harken documents that the agency
amassed in the case, along with interviews with Meulbroek and the
broker who told the SEC he initiated Bush's stock sale, leave another
crucial question unanswered:</TE>
<TE>   Who stepped up to buy Bush's stock, at a time when Harken was
bleeding red ink and Bush was trying to raise cash to pay off the
loan he used to buy into the Texas Rangers baseball team?</TE>
<TE>   "Bush didn't even know who the buyer was at the time. He still
doesn't know. No one but me ever knew who the buyer was. And no one
ever will know," said Ralph Smith, the now-retired Los Angeles
institutional trader who represented that buyer in the sale.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nobody's business. There isn't anything there. And nothing
was done wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Bush has said repeatedly through the years that the SEC's
investigation was thorough and that it cleared him of any wrongdoing,
beyond the technical violation that he reported the sale to the SEC
eight months late.</TE>
<TE>   It was that tardy report filed in March 1991 that caught the eye
of the enforcement division's lawyers and launched the SEC probe on
April 5 that year, according to the agency's internal documents in
the case. The SEC has been releasing some of those files, stack by
stack, to the Washington-based Center for Public Integrity and to
newspapers, including The Times, under the Freedom of Information
Act.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC's probe has been dogged by skepticism and partisan
challenges almost from the start. The agency's chairman at the time
was Richard C. Breeden, a staunch supporter of Bush's father, who
appointed him to the post.</TE>
<TE>   Breeden has maintained that he distanced himself from the staff's
investigation, giving the agency's lawyers a free hand. And the
internal documents released so far show no indication of political
interference or pressure from the top.</TE>
<TE>   The documents chronicle a probe spanning 4 1/2 months. It included
at least four lawyers in the SEC's enforcement division, led by
Assistant Director Herbert F. Janick III, who is now general counsel
at UBS PaineWebber Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Those SEC lawyers, most of whom have left the agency for private
practice, still decline to comment on the case.</TE>
<TE>   In recommending that the case be closed, the three investigating
lawyers stated in a memorandum to their division chief: "The staff's
investigation indicates that there is insufficient evidence to
establish three necessary aspects of a possible insider trading
case."</TE>
<TE>   The investigators never interviewed Bush. But they extensively
questioned Harken's chief in-house lawyer, the company's outside
counsel and Bush's personal lawyer, who together handed over boxes
full of internal memos, board meeting minutes and other confidential
correspondence.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC lawyers also questioned stock trader Smith for more than
two hours in a conference call, and Smith turned over copies of most
of his notes on the sale.</TE>
<TE>   "The SEC did their job," Smith said in an interview last week,
adding that it was the only time in 25 years as an institutional
trader that he had been contacted by SEC investigators.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they went further than they needed to just to make sure
they crossed all the Ts and dotted all the I's. This was the
president's son, after all."</TE>
<TE>   Put In Call to Bush</TE>
<TE>   Smith was sitting at his desk at Sutro &amp; Co. on the 34th floor of
the Arco Towers in downtown Los Angeles on June 8, 1990, working the
phones. He was making "cold calls" for a client when he found himself
speaking for the first time in his life to a president's son.</TE>
<TE>   The calls were based on research Smith had done on Harken after
one of his clients--"an institutional investor," is as far as he'll
go in identifying the buyer--expressed interest in buying a large
block of Harken shares. He said he tried several other major
shareholders before calling Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The mystery over the buyer's identity raises the question of
whether someone was doing Bush a favor, and why. But securities law
doesn't require a buyer to be identified except when acquiring more
than 5% of a company or representing a company director or officer.</TE>
<TE>   Through SEC filings, Smith said, he had learned that Bush was
among the Harken directors who had reported large share holdings in
the company. Bush was hardly the largest; a Saudi Arabian businessman
and the Harvard University endowment fund, for example, each held
millions of shares, SEC files show.</TE>
<TE>   But, Smith recalled, he thought he would take a shot at the
president's son, and he called him at the Texas Rangers' front
office.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Bush said he might be interested [in selling], but he said he
had to check out some things first and that I should call back in a
couple weeks. I just assumed he had to check out if he could legally
sell."</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, Smith called back, and Bush "said he checked it
out and he'd be willing to sell a block of stock," Smith recalled.
"He told me how much he had to sell, and that was that. I called the
company's counsel to make sure it was clean stock, and we made the
buy."</TE>
<TE>   "His trade was smooth as silk," Smith added, calling Bush "a very
nice man" and "a straight shooter." Smith said he has been an ardent
Bush supporter ever since the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Ten months passed before Smith heard from the SEC. The enforcement
division had just learned of Bush's late filing of a Form 4 that
reported the June 22, 1990, sale eight months late. He was required
to report it by July 10.</TE>
<TE>   That and other details had aroused the SEC's suspicions. One
internal SEC "confidential advice memorandum" explained:</TE>
<TE>   "This investigation arose from Enforcement's concern as to several
facts surrounding this stock transaction. Bush sold a large portion
of his Harken stock (approximately two-thirds) at approximately $4
per share six weeks before the public announcement of a company
[restructuring] which resulted in a significant decline in its stock
price.</TE>
<TE>   "Immediately following the announcement of the reorganization, the
price fell to 2 3/8 per share."</TE>
<TE>   That's where the investigation began. That's also where it would
end.</TE>
<TE>   Directors' stock, like the more than 300,000 shares Bush held at
the time, is subject to an array of restrictions. For example,
securities law barred Bush from soliciting a buyer for his stock.</TE>
<TE>   Corporations also have internal rules that prohibit directors from
selling stock just before or after significant events, such as
announcements of earnings, mergers or internal reorganizations that
could affect their stock price.</TE>
<TE>   Those rules exist in part to avoid illegal trading based on a
director's inside knowledge of significant upcoming events. And among
the three key elements the SEC would have to prove to justify action
against Bush is that he deliberately acted outside the law or the
rules with motives of personal gain.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first of the elements that the agency realized it
couldn't prove, SEC documents indicate.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, after he spoke with Smith the first time, the SEC case
files show, Bush contacted Harken's chief counsel seeking a formal
opinion on whether he could legally and properly sell his shares. The
in-house counsel called the company's outside lawyers for a second
opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on the information they had," one SEC memo stated, "they
saw no reason why Bush could not sell his stock." The company's
lawyers also checked with Harken's chairman and another key board
member who was a lawyer and major shareholder.</TE>
<TE>   None of them, the SEC later concluded, "knew of any inside
information that would prevent Bush from selling his stock, and
neither of the [corporate counsels] objected to Bush's proposed
sale."</TE>
<TE>   In light of that, the memo added, "it would be difficult to
establish that, even assuming Bush possessed material nonpublic
information, he acted with ... intent to defraud."</TE>
<TE>   The second element for the SEC to prosecute the case focused on
what Bush knew and when he knew it before the stock sale.</TE>
<TE>   Several internal SEC memos said Bush had seen only one document
during the first week of June--three weeks before the sale--that
forecast a $4.2-million loss in the quarter that would end that
month, a loss consistent with Harken's performance in preceding
quarters.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, two months after Bush's sale, when the company
released its second-quarter 1990 report, it showed the far worse
$23.2-million loss, which reflected write-downs related to the
accounting of Harken's sale of a chain of Hawaiian gas stations that
the SEC had ordered Harken to restructure.</TE>
<TE>   If Bush knew the extent of those looming losses before selling his
stock, the SEC investigators reasoned, it would flag possibly
improper inside trading. And there is at least one internal Harken
document the SEC obtained during its probe that suggests Bush did
know a big write-down may be coming.</TE>
<TE>   The investigators had the minutes of a meeting of the audit
committee of Harken's board of directors from June 11, just 11 days
before Bush's sale.</TE>
<TE>   Bush was a member of the audit committee and present that day when
a representative of Harken's outside auditing firm told the members
that "there was a potential write-down that might occur" during the
quarter. That write-down "could be potentially significant, but the
amount is not identifiable at this time."</TE>
<TE>   For weeks during this period, company documents, including minutes
from directors' meetings, warned in general terms of Harken's
worsening financial condition and a liquidity crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, though, not even that mattered.</TE>
<TE>   It was Meulbroek's report on what happened to Harken's stock when
the company announced its big second-quarter losses on Aug. 20 that
tipped the scale.</TE>
<TE>   If investors didn't view that report as "materially" affecting the
company, and show it by selling off shares and driving down the
price, there would be no case, the SEC lawyers concluded. And
Meulbroek found that, in the end, it didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Harken's stock opened at $3 a share on Aug. 20, her report stated.
The earnings report came out at 9:34 a.m. that day. For three hours,
nothing happened. Then, as the SEC's initial investigative documents
indicated, the stock nose-dived by 21% in the afternoon, closing at
$2.37.</TE>
<TE>   But Muelbroek, reasoning that Harken was a thinly traded stock,
decided to analyze the stock's movement on the following day as well,
which was standard practice at the time. She discovered that the
stock rebounded to recover all its losses of the previous day,
closing at $3 on Aug. 21.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless another reason exists for the price rebound on Aug. 21,
the most likely explanation for the increase is that investors
overreacted to the earnings announcement, recognized their error, and
corrected it," her report said. "Such price reversals are rare but
not unheard of."</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line: The announcement had no "material effect" on the
stock. So, even if Bush knew it was coming two months before, that
knowledge was worthless, Meulbroek's findings concluded, although she
said Friday, "We still don't know what caused the stock to rebound
that day."</TE>
<TE>   In one of their final memos on the case, the SEC lawyers ended by
citing Meulbroek's report, then stated, "For the reasons set forth
above, we recommend that this matter be closed."</TE>
<TE>   By the end of that year, Harken's stock had tanked, selling as low
as $1 a share. But in the interim, Saddam Hussein had invaded Kuwait,
Bush's father was mobilizing for the Persian Gulf War, and the only
ace in the hole for Harken was an exclusive contract to explore for
oil off Bahrain--in the heart of the war zone.</TE>

<KH>CRISIS IN CORPORATE AMERICA</KH>
<HD>Reform 'Frenzy' Divides, Quiets Business Lobby</HD>
<DH>Congress: A crackdown on corporate fraud looks inevitable.
Advocates are biding their time until competing bills reach a
conference committee.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>With legislation to crack down on corporate fraud primed for Senate
passage Monday, Capitol Hill's usually powerful business lobbyists
suddenly are playing an unfamiliar role: defense. And they are deeply
divided over exactly what their strategy should be in dealing with a
newly hostile Congress.</LD>
<LD>   The group representing the chief executives of the nation's
largest businesses has decided to go with the tide for now, endorsing
the Senate bill that would slap a host of new penalties and
regulations on corporate America. But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
the voice of businesses large and small, opposes the bill's major
provisions.</LD>
<LD>   The high-tech industry is lobbying hard against stricter
accounting of stock options, so far succeeding in keeping it out of
the bill. But other business groups are keeping a low profile rather
than fighting a losing battle in the Senate.</LD>
<TE>   The fact that any business lobbyists are supporting--or not
vigorously opposing--vast new regulation of corporate America is a
measure of how dramatically the environment has changed as a result
of the cascade of business scandals, especially since WorldCom Inc.
announced it had misstated its earnings by almost $4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "No businessman or woman is applauding when there is a highly
regulated structure in place," said Johanna Schneider of the Business
Roundtable, the lobbying group for the chief executives of major
corporations. "However, much like the situation changed after 9/11,
this is a completely new situation and it has to be handled as such.
Our typical response is less regulation, but in this situation there
obviously needs to be some regulatory solutions."</TE>
<TE>   The quandary the business groups confront is an object lesson in
the difficulty of lobbying on an issue such as corporate reform that
is hot, hot, hot.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush and the Democrats made corporate fraud the subject
of their radio addresses Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps the greatest need for our economy at this moment is
restoring confidence in the integrity of the American business
leaders," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Democratic response, Rep. David D. Phelps of Illinois said
the "opportunity for bipartisan reform is being fought by special
interests."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I say, enough is enough," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But last week, business lobbyists for the most part could only
stand by as their traditional GOP allies joined with Democrats in
approving one amendment after another that toughened the Senate bill.</TE>
<TE>   After its expected passage, the measure will have to be reconciled
with a bill approved by the Republican-controlled House that
Democrats call inadequate. These negotiations will give lobbyists
plenty of opportunity to kill provisions they consider onerous. But
the seemingly unstoppable momentum surrounding the Senate bill has
raised doubts about their chances of success.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not even sure how relevant the lobbying is at this point,"
said Mark Isakowitz, a Republican lobbyist with close ties to the
business community. "You could do all the lobbying you want, but if
there's another big company announcing a restatement of earnings,
that could wipe out any progress you make."</TE>
<TE>   The conflicting approaches business lobbyists have taken toward
the Senate bill underscore the diversity of interests in a community
that often seems monolithic.</TE>
<TE>   The most striking contrast came last week as the Senate opened
debate on the bill sponsored by Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) that
seeks to strengthen federal oversight of the accounting profession
and would create new penalties for corporate criminals. The Business
Roundtable took out full-page newspaper advertisements decrying
corporate wrongdoing and embracing the Senate bill.</TE>
<TE>   "Enough is enough," said the ad's headline. "When even one CEO
betrays investors, it's one too many."</TE>
<TE>   The group's spokeswoman said chief executives believed any
reservations they had about particulars of the Sarbanes bill were
outweighed by anxiety about the rapid erosion of public confidence in
the entire corporate governance system.</TE>
<TE>   "They are very, very concerned about all companies being dragged
down," Schneider said. "CEOs feel the sooner we can get changes in
place and move forward, the better."</TE>
<TE>   But the same day the Business Roundtable endorsed the Senate bill,
the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce called a news
conference to detail his group's objections to its core elements,
including its provisions to create an independent oversight board for
auditors and to limit the ability of accounting firms to sell
nonaudit services to audit clients.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Donohue, the chamber president, said the Senate bill was an
overreaction to recent scandals and part of an anti-corporate
"feeding frenzy."</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Josten, the chamber's executive vice president, discounted
the split between his organization and the Business Roundtable,
saying the two groups were simply taking a different tack in pursuit
of a similar end: to get the bill into a conference committee where
negotiators will iron out differences between the Sarbanes bill and
the more limited version passed by the House.</TE>
<TE>   Also pushing for changes has been the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants, representing the accounting profession.
The group wants to ease the Sarbanes bill's restrictions on
nonauditing services and ensure accountants have a role in setting
new audit standards.</TE>
<TE>   But the accountant group says the accounting profession is so
under siege that it hired a media consultant to tell reporters its
officials would not be talking to the press.</TE>
<TE>   A Democratic aide to the Senate Banking Committee said the
accountant lobby had been active while the panel was considering the
Sarbanes bill. But the lobbyists were lying low during last week's
Senate debate because "they have lost credibility," the aide said.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the Sarbanes bill expect the accountant group to
mobilize to push for what they want in the House-Senate conference
committee.</TE>
<TE>   "They are very shrewd and have deep pockets," said a senior Senate
Democratic aide.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan
research group that tracks campaign contributions, the accountant
group gave more than $8.5 million to congressional candidates in both
parties from 1989 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Lobbyists for other industries are working to keep the fervor for
corporate reform from spreading to measures that directly affect
their interests. That's why the high-technology industry has worked
so hard to block an amendment by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) to
require companies to deduct from their income the value of stock
option grants--an important part of high-tech compensation packages.</TE>
<TE>   McCain argued that the current practice of not deducting options
allows companies to overstate their profits--and that executives had
an incentive to resort to gimmickry to inflate the value of their
options. He fumed Thursday when a parliamentary maneuver by Senate
Democratic leaders effectively blocked him from offering his
amendment--a maneuver he called a gift to Silicon Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Hellman, vice president of the Information Technology
Industry Council, said the high-tech industry's position was
bolstered when President Bush did not endorse McCain's proposal in
his speech on corporate responsibility Tuesday. That's an outcome the
high-tech lobby labored to ensure by swaying Bush to their position
months ago, Hellman said.</TE>
<TE>   High-tech lobbyists were not alone in trying to influence White
House thinking on these issues. One well-connected business lobbyist
said he had encouraged the administration to "embrace this issue with
indignation" to avoid putting Republicans on the spot politically.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, however, many Senate aides said the most remarkable
feature of business' lobbying recently is how relatively quiet they
have been during the Senate's debate on legislation that would amount
to the most aggressive regulation of corporate corruption since the
Great Depression.</TE>
<TE>   "They have been pretty quiet," said Deb Fiddelke, a spokeswoman
for Sen. Charles Hagel (R-Neb.), who supports the bill. To oppose it
in this climate, she said, "is like getting in front of a buzz saw."</TE>

<HD>In New South, Racist Rally Is Not a Draw</HD>
<DH>Georgia: In Gainesville, there was little enthusiasm for a
parade request from the National Alliance. At the event, police
outnumbered marchers 2 to 1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GAINESVILLE, Ga.</DL>
<LD>If you ever meet Chester J. Doles, don't call him a racist. "White
nationalist" is the term he likes.</LD>
<LD>   The 42-year-old violent ex-con with the Nazi tattoos and the 10
home-schooled children drove down from the north Georgia mountains
with a band of skinheads Saturday to stomp around the town square,
wave flags and shout nasty things about immigrants.</LD>
<LD>   "What do we want?" Doles hollered.</LD>
<TE>   "Mexicans out!" the skinheads answered.</TE>
<TE>   "When do we want it?" Doles yelled again.</TE>
<TE>   "Now!"</TE>
<TE>   "We are not your enemy!" screamed another burly man in combat
fatigues.</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time, a white supremacist rally was a main event in
the kudzu-covered woods of north Georgia. The area was infamous
during the Jim Crow era and beyond for violent Ku Klux Klan marches
and road signs--official ones, put up by the counties--warning blacks
to get out of town by sunset.</TE>
<TE>   These days, most hate groups have gone deep underground. And many
of the once all-white communities where they were based, like
Gainesville, have become home to immigrants, blacks and all sorts of
diversity.</TE>
<TE>   What made Saturday's hate rally unusual was that the organizers
picked a very visible spot to stir up trouble.</TE>
<TE>   And nobody bit.</TE>
<TE>   "We were kind of hoping the cops would clear out the town square
and let us go at it with the parasites," Doles said, referring to a
small group of teenage counter-protesters.</TE>
<TE>   But as Doles' men marched down drizzly Main Street, their Aryan
flags limp with rain, their jackboots squeaky, nobody paid much
attention.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, there was a much bigger crowd at a nearby ham radio
convention.</TE>
<TE>   "We put out the word to stay away," said Greg Bautista, a Latino
activist in Gainesville. "We know this group is using concerns about
illegal immigration as a front for white supremacy. We didn't want to
dignify them."</TE>
<TE>   Doles' group, part of a larger neo-Nazi organization called the
National Alliance, picked Gainesville, 50 miles north of Atlanta,
because it's home to one of the highest concentrations of Latino
immigrants in the South. The town of 26,000 is the self-proclaimed
"poultry capital of the world," and thousands of Mexican immigrants
have come here to work in the numerous chicken plants, taking
minimum-wage jobs that most locals eschew.</TE>
<TE>   The 2000 census found the city is 33% Latino, up fourfold since
1990. Gainesville officials say that, with undocumented immigrants,
that figure is closer to 60%.</TE>
<TE>   There are groceries and travel agencies owned by Mexican
immigrants, a Spanish-language Bible book store, a bilingual
newspaper and taquerias with pickups out front sporting Confederate
flag bumper stickers.</TE>
<TE>   And there are growing pains too. Some neighboring towns have
passed laws prohibiting day laborers from soliciting work on street
corners, a campaign seen as anti-Latino. There also are emerging gang
problems, though in one recent, much-publicized street battle between
two "Mexican" gangs, it turned out that the shooter was a white kid.</TE>
<TE>   Gainesville, an old trading post town in the foothills of the
Appalachian Mountains, has tried to meet the surge of immigrants with
more bilingual services. City officials also are pushing to institute
automatic raises for police officers who learn to speak Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lived here my whole life," police Capt. Jane Nichols said.
"It's not like we're going downhill. These immigrants come to
Gainesville to work their tails off. They're good for the community."</TE>
<TE>   That's why there was zero enthusiasm when city officials received
a parade request from the National Alliance, an anti-Semitic,
anti-black group that believes in establishing all-white "homelands"
in the U.S. The city restricted them to a one-hour, one-loop march
around the town square, with its blooming crepe myrtle trees and
Confederate war statue.</TE>
<TE>   The Anti-Defamation League considers the National Alliance, with
an estimated 1,500 members, one of the most dangerous racist
organizations in the country. Oklahoma City bomber Timothy J. McVeigh
was inspired by "The Turner Diaries," a neo-Nazi book written by
alliance founder William Pierce. Several leaders have been convicted
of violent crimes, such as Doles, who spent five years in prison for
beating a black man who was seen with a white woman. The brawny,
buzz-cut Doles now lives in a fenced-off compound deep in the woods
north of Gainesville with his children and wife, who's expecting her
11th child.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing our share to fight immigrant overpopulation," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Lauter, director of the Anti-Defamation League's office in
Atlanta, has been watching the National Alliance closely.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are pretty sick," she said. "But they're also clever.
They're careful not to advocate violence outright, but they still
encourage their followers to go after blacks and Jews."</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, it was difficult to take them seriously. After months
of planning, there were fewer than 75 marchers; police outnumbered
them 2 to 1. Many of their chants were drowned out by the sirens of
squad cars trailing them.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, man, look at that," one passerby said, pointing to a
National Alliance banner with its red, white and black stripes.
"Funny how much it looks like the Mexican flag."</TE>

<HD>Wayward Orca Finally Gets Back Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HANSON ISLAND, British Columbia</DL>
<LD>An orphaned killer whale that strayed into Puget Sound last winter
and won hearts for her troubled species arrived back in her home
waters Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   A high-speed catamaran carrying the whale arrived in Dong Chong
Bay, where a crane lifted the orca onto a barge. She was examined and
tested and then put in a net pen 50 feet square and 65 feet deep.</LD>
<LD>   During the 400-mile trip to Johnstone Strait, near the north end
of Vancouver Island, the mammal, nicknamed Springer, got a bit
restless, wiggling in her water-filled travel box while handlers
scratched her skin and doused her with cool water.</LD>
<TE>   The 12-foot whale, called A-73 for her birth order in Canada's "A"
pod, or family group of orcas, spent at least six months in Puget
Sound, often swimming beside the Seattle-area passenger ferries.
Scientists captured her last month to treat her health problems and
to attempt to reunite her with the pod.</TE>
<TE>   Whale handler Jeff Foster and his crew covered her upper body with
wet towels and slathered her dorsal fin and the skin around her
blowhole with ointment to keep her skin moist. During the journey up
the Inside Passage between Vancouver Island and the west coast of
British Columbia, Foster and his crew took turns petting and talking
to the orca to comfort her.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a very calm animal. And at that age they're very
adaptable," said handler Jen Schorr, 30, of Seattle. "They're pretty
bold in most cases. They're the top predator, so they can afford to
be."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and Canadian officials arranged the relocation in hopes that
the whale would rejoin her family group.</TE>
<TE>   Pods from the A clan whose vocalization patterns are similar to
A-73's have been in the area for weeks, and her grandmother's group
was spotted there Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The consensus is that she will fare better there than in the busy
water near Seattle, where her health faltered as she struggled to
feed herself from mid-January until her capture June 13.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the waters where she grew up, and fish she knows how to
catch," said Marilyn Joyce, marine mammal resource coordinator for
Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans.</TE>
<TE>   Orca experts noted the disappearance and likely death of A-73's
mother last year, and believe the young whale then wandered south to
the Seattle area because she was unable to keep up with the rest of
the group.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife officials worried as the orca grew friendly with boaters
around the Vashon Island ferry dock in busy Puget Sound, even
scratching herself on the hulls of small boats and raising the threat
that she could upset a small craft as she grew.</TE>
<TE>   Now that her health problems have been cleared up, and her weight
has increased to 1,348 pounds, the Vancouver Aquarium will oversee
her care in a net pen near Hanson Island until her release.</TE>
<TE>   "If her pod comes by tomorrow, and they vocalized and were
positive, we could release her tomorrow ... open the door and cross
our fingers," David Huff of Vancouver Aquarium said.</TE>
<TE>   Killer whales, a species of dolphin, live in all the world's
oceans. Resident populations on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border
feed on fish, while transient coastal populations live on other
marine mammals.</TE>
<TE>   Both groups are threatened by depleted salmon runs, growing ship
traffic and pollution.</TE>
<GT></GT>

Wash., and put into a tank on a boat that will take her 400 miles
north. Researchers hope she will reunite with her original pod, which
is off Canada.</CP>

<HD>A Simple Plan to Boost Tourism, Honor Black History Goes
Awry</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOWLING GREEN, Va.</DL>
<LD>On the courthouse lawn, a 15-foot statue of a Confederate soldier
faces south toward Richmond, head bowed, rifle in hand. It is a
symbol meant to memorialize the town's occupation by the Union Army
in 1864. To many blacks, however, it is a reminder of the part of
local history that has gone unrecorded and unhonored.</LD>
<LD>   So two years ago, Bowling Green's multiracial tourist commission
came up with the idea of erecting a black history monument next to
the soldier at the front of the lawn on Main Street. The announced
goal was to promote tourism in Caroline County by coaxing travelers
into town from nearby Interstate 95. If the new statue also helped
overcome the historical imbalance, so much the better, some thought.</LD>
<LD>   But officials quickly found that coming to grips with symbols in
the South remains a sensitive business, and raises issues that many
people would rather leave unspoken.</LD>
<TE>   The monument would depict two events: an unsuccessful slave
rebellion in 1800 led by blacksmith Gabriel Prosser, and the 1958
marriage and arrest of Richard Loving, a white, and Mildred Jetter, a
woman of mixed race, which led to a historic U.S. Supreme Court
decision. The design prompted impassioned meetings of the county's
board of supervisors and a visit by a Justice Department conciliation
specialist.</TE>
<TE>   The board ultimately voted down the design and is once again
searching for a way to commemorate African American history in a way
acceptable to most residents.</TE>
<TE>   "At first the board had only three questions: about placement,
funding and whether the African American community embraced the idea
of a monument," said Linda Thomas, president of the local National
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People. "Then pretty soon I
started hearing, 'Oh, oh, this is never going to fly with [its
depiction of] Gabriel and the Lovings.' "</TE>
<TE>   Before the board of supervisors rejected it last year on a 3-2
vote, 400 black residents signed a petition supporting the monument
and 17 spoke in its favor at one of five board meetings that dragged
on past midnight. The only person to speak against it was Garnet
Brooks, the former sheriff who arrested the Lovings for violating
Virginia's anti-miscegenation law.</TE>
<TE>   The board's majority said the monument would be divisive and that
depicting the planned rebellion would celebrate violence. Blacks
argued that the event marked the start of their own movement for
independence, even though Prosser, who was later hanged, was from
Henrico County and had probably never been to Caroline County.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, with all the problems we face in this country today, I'm
not sure that a monument is the No. 1 issue on people's minds," board
chairman Calvin Taylor, a black who voted with the majority, said in
a recent interview. "Besides, my understanding was that the monument
was to honor African American achievement, and the Lovings' marriage
wasn't just an African American achievement. It was the achievement
of all mankind."</TE>
<TE>   Although the final design of the monument remains in question,
many residents in this county, whose population of 22,000 is
one-third black, see some good coming out of the debate.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that we're not afraid to talk to each other or argue
this out in public, the fact that it has inspired and emboldened folk
who have never realized they are part of government to step forward
and speak out, that's healthy," the NAACP's Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, the three white and two black supervisors have
tried to keep things calm. They erected a highway marker on the
Little Fish Bridge to the Caroline County slaves who planned to join
the Prosser rebellion, and they mounted a plaque in the courthouse to
the Lovings, whose challenge to their one-year jail sentences
resulted in the Supreme Court in 1967 forcing 16 states to throw out
their anti-miscegenation laws.</TE>
<TE>   The board also asked a five-member committee of blacks born in
Caroline County to submit ideas for a less controversial monument. It
would be a multicultural obelisk at the rear of the lawn, with two
panels devoted to the history of European settlers and two to that of
minorities.</TE>
<TE>   The board wanted to include the Rappahannock Indians on one panel,
but Geraldine Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the tribe, nixed the idea,
telling supervisors that hundreds of years of neglect and prejudice
could not be adequately addressed in a memorial.</TE>
<TE>   Most residents say the new monument would be too politically
correct and bland to lure many travelers from I-95, so the county has
started looking for new ways to get a slice of the nearly $13 billion
travelers spent in Virginia last year.</TE>
<TE>   Its target is Caroline County's most famous native son, the late
Secretariat, winner of horse racing's Triple Crown in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the legendary thoroughbred is commemorated only with a
local highway marker. But Caroline County's director of economic
development and tourism, Gary Wilson, says plans are afoot to turn
Secretariat's home at Meadow Farm into a major tourist
attraction--and perhaps to honor the great horse with a
noncontroversial monument.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BEND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Residents of 200 homes were forced to evacuate Saturday as a raging
wildfire burned about 3 miles away, fire officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The fire grew to 10,000 acres from 6,000 acres in just hours and
was burning on very steep terrain in prime wildfire conditions, said
Marc Hollen, spokesman for the Northwest Fire Coordination Center.</LD>
<LD>   About 660 firefighters were battling the blaze, started by
lightning last week, he said. The fire, about 3 miles from Three
Rivers in central Oregon, jumped containment lines late Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, the fire jumped the Metolius River and began burning in
an area without roads in the Deschutes National Forest, Hollen said.</TE>
<TE>   The wildfire is so remote that firefighters have used boats to get
there.</TE>
<TE>   Officials had evacuated about 20 summer homes along the Metolius
River as a precaution, but no homes have burned yet, Hollen said.</TE>
<TE>   There was no estimate for containment, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Wyoming, a blaze on the east side of the Grand Canyon in
Yellowstone National Park grew to more than 7,300 acres Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Several trails and campsites near the blaze have been closed, but
all roads and major tourist attractions in Yellowstone have remained
open.</TE>
<TE>   Five other wildfires in the state that have scorched more than
30,000 acres were not contained Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Killing Wolves in the Pursuit of Their Salvation</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: As ranks swell, some run afoul of ranchers. To
protect the species, individual canines are shot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>STANLEY, Idaho</DL>
<LD>At every stage of the seven-year federal effort to reintroduce the
gray wolf to the Northern Rockies, Carter Niemeyer has been there.</LD>
<LD>   He trapped wolves in Canada and brought them south to their new
homes. When one pack was getting into trouble with ranchers, he
camped in the open with them, listening to them howl all night before
transporting several farther from the temptations of livestock. When
ranchers wrongly accused them of killing lambs or calves, he argued
their cases and exonerated many.</LD>
<LD>   Along the way, this gentle 6-foot, 5 1/2-inch giant developed a
deep affection for the animals he calls "big, happy oafs."</LD>
<TE>   So it was with a heavy heart that Niemeyer, 55, the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service official in charge of reintroducing the wolf to
central Idaho, ordered the killing of the Whitehawk pack this
spring--and then carried out the order himself.</TE>
<TE>   As he did, Niemeyer plunged into the heart of the most contentious
aspects of reintroducing wolves to the Northern Rockies.</TE>
<TE>   Having been all but wiped out by the 1920s, the wolves have come
back faster and proved to be hardier than federal wildlife officials
dreamed possible. In central Idaho alone, the population has swollen
from the 35 reintroduced in 1995 and 1996 to 261 at last official
count.</TE>
<TE>   It may be too much of a good thing. The wolves have eaten hundreds
of cows and other livestock. Ranchers and local politicians had
acquiesced to the reintroduction only if federal wildlife managers
agreed to kill wolves that could not be otherwise persuaded to leave
livestock alone. They are demanding that the government make good on
the deal.</TE>
<TE>   But humans' fascination with wolves runs long and deep: the myth
of the she-wolf who suckled Romulus and Remus before they founded
ancient Rome; the Big Bad Wolf of "Little Red Riding Hood"; the 1990
film "Dances With Wolves."</TE>
<TE>   So when government gunners, living up to the agreement with the
ranchers, have killed the majestic animals, they have triggered
outpourings of outraged calls, letters and e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   More Trouble Ahead</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the Whitehawk pack, wildlife officials worked
tirelessly to deter the wolves from eating livestock. The pack's fate
was followed closely by wolf lovers. Its home was the spectacular
Sawtooth Mountains--Idaho's Yosemite--and its alpha (or lead) female
was a snow-white beauty named Alabaster.</TE>
<TE>   By early last summer, the pack was in trouble. It had killed 16
sheep, a calf and a guard dog. Wolf opponents were calling for the
pack's heads.</TE>
<TE>   But Niemeyer had other plans. Electric fences were erected to
protect the sheep overnight. Volunteers slept with the herd for weeks
on end in the meadows below the jagged peaks of the White Cloud
Mountains. Wolf managers rigged up a device called a rag box that, in
response to a signal from a wolf's collar, blared noises such as
gunshots, helicopters and yelling cowboys. The livestock losses
stopped, and the wolves were spared.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the pack moved to the opposite side of the mountain
range. Ten rag boxes were set up in pastures to scare them off.</TE>
<TE>   But on March 31, the wolves ate a pet sheep penned near a ranch
house. Electronic monitors set up in the rancher's field identified
two wolves as the culprits, and Niemeyer ordered them killed. Cracker
shells, which explode with a loud bang and a flash, were fired from a
helicopter to chase off the remaining wolves.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, two days later a calf was killed, and monitors
fingered three more wolves from the pack. Niemeyer ordered their
deaths as well.</TE>
<TE>   One more effort was made to deter the wolves, but the next morning
yet another calf was eaten.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when I made the decision," Niemeyer said. "I felt we had
come to the point that our nonlethal efforts were futile and this
pack needed to be removed."</TE>
<TE>   Armed with a semiautomatic rifle, Niemeyer flew in a helicopter
several dozen feet above the foothills of the White Cloud Mountains
in pursuit of the five remaining members of the pack, including
Alabaster, who was nearing the end of a pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   Betrayed by transmitters in their collars, the animals were
running for their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Starting with Alabaster and her mate, Niemeyer shot the wolves one
after another. "It was very surgical and humane," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Niemeyer said he got 300 angry e-mails after he killed the
Whitehawk pack. "In a perfect world, we would not kill wolves," he
said. "But this is not a perfect world."</TE>
<TE>   Niemeyer decided to be the one to pull the trigger because he
anticipated intense criticism.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the judge, jury and executioner," he said in a morose tone.</TE>
<TE>   No Thrill in a Kill</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in Iowa, Niemeyer had seen a film clip of an aerial
gunner shooting wolves in Minnesota. To a boy who loved to trap and
hunt, the gunner seemed to have a dream job. "I remember feeling,
'Wow! I'd like to do that someday,' " Niemeyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Now he loathes it. "At times like that, I'd just like to
disappear. It's not thrilling to kill a wolf, like I imagined as a
kid."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, he and other federal officials working with the wolf
program believe that killing individual wolves with a taste for
livestock is essential to ensuring the long-term existence of wolves
as a species in the Northern Rockies, where many people remain
dedicated to their demise.</TE>
<TE>   Killing wolves is likely to become much more common when the three
states where they have been reintroduced--Idaho, Montana and
Wyoming--take over their management. That will happen after the
wolves are removed from the federal endangered species list, which
could come as early as next year, said Ed Bangs, Niemeyer's boss as
the wolf coordinator for the Northern Rockies.</TE>
<TE>   The important thing, Bangs said, is the survival of the wolves as
a species, not the survival of individual wolves.</TE>
<TE>   That's not so easy to get the public to accept.</TE>
<TE>   "Wolves are so much like us that we tend to strongly identify with
them," Bangs said. Wolves are caring parents and good spouses. They
hunt and eat together in packs and look after one another. They
jealously guard their territory, repelling outsiders.</TE>
<TE>   The environmentalist most closely involved with the
reintroduction, Suzanne Laverty of Defenders of Wildlife, fears that
when the states take over they will shoot first instead of trying
nonlethal means to control the wolves. "It can't be acceptable to
kill pack after pack," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Whitehawk pack had migrated into this region after the members
of two other packs were killed or moved out of the area for attacking
livestock. Just two months after the Whitehawk pack was shot, there
were several reports of new wolves in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists argue that wolves should have special protection
at the Sawtooth National Recreation Area because the federal
government set it aside as a special place to enjoy wilderness. But
ranchers have leased the meadows for grazing for decades.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Lynn Winmill ruled last month that the law
establishing the Sawtooth National Recreation Area gave wolves and
all other wildlife precedence over livestock. The local environmental
groups that brought the case now have asked the judge to block
long-standing grazing permits in the Sawtooth Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The national environmental group Defenders of Wildlife, by
contrast, has looked for ways for ranchers and wolves to live
together. It supplies ranchers with huge white Great Pyrenees dogs to
guard herds. It teaches ranchers simple techniques to avoid losses,
such as burying animals that die of natural causes and gathering
animals at night.</TE>
<TE>   It even compensates ranchers for lost livestock. In the last 14
years, Defenders of Wildlife's wolf compensation program has given
198 ranchers more than $227,000 for more than 900 animals killed by
wolves across the Northern Rockies.</TE>
<TE>   Flagging Offenders</TE>
<TE>   Defenders of Wildlife is working with federal agencies this summer
on a new tool to control wolves, called fladry. It consists of
unlikely barriers of red fabric strips a few inches wide and about 18
inches long, hanging from cords like the flags that mark racers'
progress in swimming pools. No one knows quite why, but wolves are
afraid to pass through fladry.</TE>
<TE>   Faye and Eron Coiner have agreed to host a fladry experiment at
their remote ranch high in the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Laverty and Niemeyer visited the ranch last month. Within minutes
of their arrival, Eron Coiner rode up on a horse and, without a word
of greeting, announced: "Found a dead calf this morning--there wasn't
much of it left.</TE>
<TE>   "So, they're back," he said in a monotone, referring to the
Jureano Mountain pack.</TE>
<TE>   Overnight, the wolves had feasted on a 250-pound calf on a high
mountain meadow covered with lupine, wild clover, geraniums, larkspur
and other wildflowers.</TE>
<TE>   The visitors were quietly pleased by the early kill, because they
hoped it would ensure a solid test for the fladry.</TE>
<TE>   The Coiners were not. They fear they could lose the $15,000 they
earn for grazing another rancher's cows if their ranch gets a
reputation for wolf kills.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the wolves ought to stay in Canada," said Coiner, 65,
wearing jeans, rubber boots and a sweat-stained cowboy hat.</TE>
<TE>   He is willing to give fladry a chance, but his hopes are not high.
"They might stay away for a little while," he said, "but they'll get
used to it just like anything else."</TE>
<TE>   To Coiner, that day's kill was just the latest proof that wolves
will prey on livestock as long as they live close together. "They eat
meat, and a calf is a very easy target."</TE>
<TE>   With the Jureano Mountain pack's record of killing livestock,
Niemeyer could have ordered some or all of those wolves killed. The
fladry study was a good excuse to keep the pack alive.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next two nights, two wolves--the alpha male and a
yearling female--were caught in traps. Both were given new collars,
which will help officials monitor the success of the fladry study.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a happy ending," Niemeyer said. "We could have killed some
wolves there. But killing wolves is easy to do. We've got a great
opportunity now to see if a nonlethal means of control works."</TE>

<HD>Shift in Hormone Science Leaves Women in Lurch</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Post-menopausal patients question the therapy's
merits after new study raises red flags.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For many women, it felt like a slap in the face.</LD>
<LD>   They had been given hormones for years at menopause to gain relief
from hot flashes and night sweats. But as the years went by they were
told something far grander: By continuing to take the drugs well past
menopause, they could not only lessen their risk of osteoporosis but
also possibly of heart disease, the leading cause of death for women.</LD>
<LD>   Now it seems the promise was not so bright. They are grappling
with the news that a five-year study of 16,608 women released Tuesday
showed that the long-term use of the hormones estrogen and progestin
actually increased the risk of heart disease, as well as breast
cancer, strokes and blood clots in the lungs and legs, although only
slightly.</LD>
<TE>   As millions of women wrestle now with the decision of whether to
continue their therapy--used for varying durations by an estimated
38% of post-menopausal women--many are wondering: How could science
be so wrong? Why were so many hormones dispensed for so long?</TE>
<TE>   One reason was simply that drugs weren't tested nearly as
rigorously in the 1930s, when the therapy was introduced. "It got
grandmothered in, as it were," said Dr. Stephen Hulley, chairman of
the department of epidemiology at UC San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Economics and sociology played their parts too. Pharmaceutical
companies poured millions of dollars into marketing a product that
could be used by tens of millions of women, who were receptive to a
chemical that could relieve the distressing symptoms of menopause and
perhaps help them ward off old age.</TE>
<TE>   But a front-and-center player was the subtlety of the truths that
science was trying to unearth and the very limitations of that
science. For more than seven decades, scientists conducted thousands
of studies to try to tease out what the hormones did--good and
bad--to women's bodies. They accrued a wealth of information but were
never able to mount a study big enough, long enough and controlled
enough to find the truth.</TE>
<TE>   The truth, as it turned out, amounted to eight extra cases of
breast cancer, seven heart attacks, eight strokes and 18 more cases
of blood clots each year per 10,000 women.</TE>
<TE>   It is a subtle effect indeed, but enough to have upset the balance
of risks and benefits that women have weighed for so many years.</TE>
<TE>   It is still not an easy decision. Hormone replacement therapy
really does help, experts stress. It alleviates menopausal symptoms
such as hot flashes, atrophy of the vagina and genitourinary tract,
and bone loss. The study released Tuesday confirmed that hormones
help ward off fractures in older women. And many women just feel
better taking hormones.</TE>
<TE>   "Some women do require hormones for quality of life, and I don't
think they should be told they can't have it," said Dr. Elizabeth
Barrett-Connor, an epidemiologist and internist at UC San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The suggestion that sex hormones might be therapeutic stretches
back long before they were discovered. The ancient Egyptians ate
extracts of ovaries as an elixir against aging. By the late 19th
century, scientists had already seen that extracts of ovaries could
alleviate hot flashes.</TE>
<TE>   Hormone replacement therapy began in the 1930s and gained momentum
with the introduction of Premarin, a drug that contained a mix of
estrogens obtained from pregnant mares' urine. Even then, there were
hints that estrogen replacement could have benefits for the bones and
heart in post-menopausal women.</TE>
<TE>   But it was a more audacious promise that launched post-menopausal
estrogen therapy into the mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, New York gynecologist Robert A. Wilson penned
"Feminine Forever." In that instant bestseller, Wilson wrote of the
"tragedy of menopause" and of his own mother's transformation from
"vital, wonderful woman" to "pain-racked, petulant invalid."</TE>
<TE>   Estrogen, he wrote, would keep women sprightly, firm-breasted,
smooth-skinned and straight-backed into old age. Women began to
clamor for the drug.</TE>
<TE>   Drug companies helped fund Wilson's efforts and have ever since
made sure that women and their doctors knew about hormones and what
they could do for a woman's well-being through ads in magazines and
journals.</TE>
<TE>   "The pharmaceutical companies play a large role" in the adoption
of hormone therapy, said Dr. Susan Love, adjunct professor of surgery
at UCLA and an outspoken critic of the treatment. "They support our
medical meetings. They pay for most of our continuing medical
education--even pay for the pizza."</TE>
<TE>   But there was certainly science to back the notion that estrogen
could help preserve a woman's health. In one landmark paper in 1976,
scientists reported that women who had had their ovaries removed--and
thus were severely estrogen-deficient--could prevent osteoporosis by
taking estrogen.</TE>
<TE>   Reams of data, from studies of people and monkeys, suggested that
hormone replacement therapy, or at least estrogen alone, would
protect women against heart disease--findings now placed in question.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, scientists noticed that women have fewer heart
attacks than men--but that after menopause, the risk started to
climb. That seemed to track the rise and fall of estrogen.</TE>
<TE>   They found estrogen improved a woman's blood cholesterol and
increased the tone of blood vessels.</TE>
<TE>   And there was other, compelling evidence from studies examining
large numbers of women.</TE>
<TE>   "Virtually all of these have shown that taking estrogens lowered
your risk of heart disease," recalled Dr. Howard Judd, chief of the
department of obstetrics and gynecology at Olive View-UCLA Medical
Center. They lowered that risk by about 40%.But not all the news was
good. Estrogen was also linked to increased rates of blood clots,
strokes and breast cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Equally smart scientists, even colleagues who have worked side by
side, have argued fiercely about the heft of all these data.</TE>
<TE>   Some thought the case for estrogen protecting the heart was so
overwhelming that a major, long-term trial would be
unethical--because half the women would be given a placebo and be
deprived of the hormones' benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Others were much less convinced, worried, always, that the seeming
benefit to the heart observed in so many studies could be put down to
causes unlinked to the hormones' biological effects.</TE>
<TE>   What, they asked, if the women who chose to take hormones were
healthier to begin with than those who did not?</TE>
<TE>   One of the skeptics was Barrett-Connor, the epidemiologist at UC
San Diego. She became convinced she was tracking an illusion in the
women she was studying. It looked as if the women choosing estrogen
were richer, healthier and more likely to take their medicines and
vitamins.</TE>
<TE>   "We were worried that estrogen was getting the credit," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, there was only one solution: large, long-term clinical
trials in which women would be randomly assigned to take hormones or
a placebo.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists finally got their trials in 1993, half a century after
hormone use began. But the findings of last week's trial, part of a
massive, government-funded effort called the Women's Health
Initiative, were so unsettling that the effort was halted abruptly
three years short of its scheduled end.</TE>
<TE>   And after all the planning, recruitment of women, money spent, and
pills and placebos swallowed, there are still many unanswered
questions.</TE>
<TE>   Were the findings so gloomy because the dosage of hormones was
wrong, or were they caused by adding progestin?</TE>
<TE>   Did women start on estrogen too long after menopause?</TE>
<TE>   But the continuing scientific debate has less relevance for women
who are now struggling to decide whether to continue their treatment
or throw their pills down the toilet. There is anger too at being led
down a riskier road than they had bargained for.</TE>
<TE>   "When people have time to read [about this study], look back to
other articles written earlier ... they'll have to make up their own
minds whether people were deliberately misled or not," Barrett-Connor
said. "I know physicians acted in the best interest of their
patients. They believed in their hearts that they were doing the
right thing."</TE>

<HD>Carpenter Shuts Down Red Sox</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Carpenter enjoyed beating his hometown team.</LD>
<LD>   Carpenter pitched seven scoreless innings, and Eric Hinske went
four for four to lead the Toronto Blue Jays over the Boston Red Sox,
4-1, Saturday at Toronto.</LD>
<LD>   A New Hampshire native, Carpenter (2-1) improved to 2-5 career
against Boston.</LD>
<TE>   "It's fun to spoil their hearts a little bit," Carpenter said.
"Everybody at home that roots for me just hopes I go out and have a
good game and maybe it's 0-0 when I'm done, and they end up winning."</TE>
<TE>   Rey Sanchez drove in Boston's only run with a pinch-hit single in
the ninth as the Red Sox avoided being shut out in consecutive games.
Roy Halladay and Kelvim Escobar combined on a three-hit shutout in a
5-0 victory Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Cliff Politte and Escobar finished the seven-hitter.
Escobar struck out pinch-hitter Jason Varitek and Jose Offerman with
runners at first and third to end it.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, we can continue to be the spoiler for the rest of the
year," Carpenter said.</TE>
<TE>   Boston's Trot Nixon said the Red Sox just ran into a couple of
good pitchers the last two days. He doesn't think they need to trade
for offense.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we are fine just the way we are," Nixon said. "Obviously,
we didn't swing the bats the way we wanted to, but that's not to say
things won't open up on Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Delgado, Josh Phelps and Hinske hit RBI doubles for the
Blue Jays, who have won two in a row against Boston after losing 11
consecutive games to the Red Sox this season.</TE>
<TE>   "They've beaten us up pretty good, but we got these last two,"
Toronto's Darrin Fletcher said.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 5-3, Chicago 3-1--Bobby Higginson hit a two-run homer at
Detroit as the Tigers completed their first doubleheader sweep in
nearly nine years.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Pena hit a tiebreaking RBI single in the eighth inning and
drove in three runs to lift the Tigers to a victory in the first
game. It was Detroit's first doubleheader sweep since Sept. 26, 1993,
at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Higginson's third-inning homer, which came after Damion Easley
walked with two outs, was his sixth of the season. It came off
Chicago starter Rocky Biddle (1-2), who lasted only 4 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   New York 14, Cleveland 5--Jorge Posada hit a grand slam and drove
in a career-high six runs, and Alfonso Soriano had two home runs and
four RBIs at Cleveland to power the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano hit the second pitch of the game by Ryan Drese (8-7) into
the left-field bleachers for his 21st homer. He had a three-run shot
off Drese on an 0-2 count during a seven-run second.</TE>
<TE>   Posada hit his second grand slam of the season and fifth of his
career to highlight a five-run fifth off reliever Jake Westbrook. He
also had a two-run double in New York's big second inning.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 6, Baltimore 0--Barry Zito pitched seven innings of
three-hit ball and Miguel Tejada hit a three-run homer at Baltimore
as the Athletics cruised to their fourth consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   Zito (12-3) struck out three, walked three and allowed only one
runner past second base to tie for the American League lead in
victories.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 8, Minnesota 1--Alex Rodriguez homered and drove in three
runs, Rafael Palmeiro had four RBIs and Kenny Rogers extended his
dominance of the Twins as the Rangers won at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers (10-5) gave up one run and five hits in seven innings to
improve to 7-1 against the Twins since 1995. He walked four and
struck out four as the Rangers ended a four-game losing streak.</TE>

<HD>Devil Rays Finally Get Last Laugh</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Tampa Bay ends eight-game losing streak with 4-3
win over Mariners. Suzuki homers twice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Sooner or later, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays figured a close game had to
go their way.</LD>
<LD>   Ben Grieve singled through a drawn-in infield with the bases
loaded in the 10th inning Saturday night, giving the team with
baseball's worst record a 4-3 victory over the Seattle Mariners. The
win also ended an eight-game losing streak for Tampa Bay.</LD>
<LD>   The Devil Rays lost five times during the streak in the opponent's
last at-bat and won for only the 18th time in an American League-high
47 games decided by one or two runs.</LD>
<TE>   "What we accomplished is we found a way to win a game. That's what
we haven't been doing. Hopefully this is a start," Tampa Bay Manager
Hal McRae said. "It all boils down to how many games you win and how
many games you lose. We've put ourselves in position to win more
games, but we haven't won. And, we've got to win more to make a
difference."</TE>
<TE>   Ichiro Suzuki homered twice in a game for the first time for
Seattle, going deep on the first pitch of the game and hitting
another solo shot off Tanyon Sturtze in the third inning for a 3-2
Seattle lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays loaded the bases in the 10th with none out against
John Halama (4-3) on Carlos Guillen's fielding error, Aubrey Huff's
single and an intentional walk.</TE>
<TE>   Grieve, who had struck out in his previous two at-bats, lined a
2-0 pitch between first and second base and Steve Cox easily beat
Suzuki's throw from shallow right field to the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been losing a lot of games, so it was just good to win,"
Grieve said. "It didn't matter if it was a close game or not."</TE>
<TE>   Esteban Yan (5-4) pitched the 10th for the win. Tampa Bay, which
hadn't won since beating the Florida Marlins on June 30, improved to
7-6 in a major league-leading 13 extra-inning games.</TE>
<TE>   Suzuki leads the majors with 41 multi-hit games, and his leadoff
homer was his third this season.</TE>

<HD>Offense Angels' Silent Partner</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Hitters can't solve Royals' Byrd in 4-0 loss that
keeps Anaheim out of wild-card lead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>To the Angel fans clamoring for more offense: One of the best
pitchers in the American League says the Angels have plenty of
offense already.</LD>
<LD>   He's Paul Byrd, and you wouldn't know the Angels have plenty of
offense from watching them try to hit him. Byrd tamed them Saturday,
pitching a three-hitter for his second shutout of the season in the
Kansas City Royals' 4-0 victory.</LD>
<LD>   Aaron Sele dug the Angels into a 3-0 hole after three innings and
staggered through six, another inconsistent outing in a season full
of them. The loss prevented the Angels from moving ahead of the
Boston Red Sox, leaders in the race for the wild-card playoff spot in
the American League. In the AL West, the Angels are three games
behind the Seattle Mariners--and one game ahead of the Oakland
Athletics.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels did not advance a runner past second base, and Byrd
retired the final 13 hitters. In three starts against the Angels this
season, he is 2-0 with a 2.66 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really like facing them," he said. "You can't pitch
around anybody.... The No. 9 hitter, [Adam] Kennedy, is hitting .295,
and he almost took me deep to center. I'm not a big fan of facing
them."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his deep fly in the eighth inning, Kennedy singled
off Byrd in the fifth. David Eckstein singled in the third, Brad
Fullmer doubled in the fourth, and that was the extent of the Angel
attack. Byrd did not overpower the Angels--he struck out two--he just
threw strikes and let his defense play along.</TE>
<TE>   He is more than happy to oblige his defense with ground balls and
fly balls. If he tried to win with strikeouts, he figures, he would
lose, and it would not be pretty.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 5-10, I'm balding and I don't have a good fastball," Byrd
said.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd threw 109 pitches in nine innings. Sele threw 108 in six,
again falling behind in counts and unable to consistently throw his
fastball to the desired spots.</TE>
<TE>   Eight of the Royals' first 13 batters reached base against Sele,
and they would have done much more damage had not Angel catcher Jorge
Fabregas thrown out one runner trying to steal in the first inning
and another in the third.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels did not have three consecutive batters reach base all
evening, but the first three reached base for Kansas City. Mike
Sweeney drove in the Royals' first run with a sacrifice fly. In the
third inning, Sweeney and Carlos Beltran each singled home a run.
Beltran homered in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Sele won 15 games for the Seattle Mariners last season, losing
five, but the fans just about booed him out of town last October. He
started three playoff games, losing them all. He has started seven
playoff games in his career, winning none.</TE>
<TE>   Sele (7-6) might not get the chance to end that streak this
season, even if the Angels advance to the playoffs. A team needs
three starters in a playoff series, perhaps four, and Sele is clearly
the Angels' fifth-best starter at this point. His ERA is 5.08.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd (12-6) might have a better chance than Sele of starting a
playoff game. Not for the Royals, of course. They haven't had a
winning season in eight years or a playoff appearance in 17, and the
baseball here could get worse before it gets better.</TE>
<TE>   But Byrd, who has accounted for more than one-third of Kansas
City's victories this season, is very much available to contenders in
search of a starting pitcher. His 3.70 ERA is as attractive as his
$850,000 salary.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd also has pitched for the New York Mets, Philadelphia Phillies
and Atlanta Braves, and the Braves might be interested in getting him
back. For his part, Byrd and his family enjoy living here and
wouldn't mind sticking around.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them I want to be here, but they said they want to go with
younger guys," he said. "I'm 31. I guess I'm too old. In baseball,
it's like dog years, or something."</TE>

<HD>Percival Is Walking Wounded</HD>

<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>Troy Percival has been the beacon of consistency in an Angel bullpen
riddled by injury and ineffectiveness. Now Percival, the Angels'
closer, is injured too.</LD>
<LD>   Percival left the stadium Saturday wearing a soft boot to protect
an infected left foot. He is scheduled to fly to California today for
further examination. Manager Mike Scioscia said he did not expect
Percival to be available before Wednesday, when the Angels open a
series in Oakland.</LD>
<LD>   Scott Schoeneweis, a starter until two weeks ago, could get a save
opportunity in Percival's absence. So could Ben Weber or rookie Scot
Shields, according to Scioscia.</LD>
<TE>   Percival said he didn't think twice when he scraped the back of
his foot--a two-inch scrape, he said--while on a family boating trip
during the All-Star break. He earned a save in Thursday's game, then
awoke in the middle of the night. "My foot was bright red, and it was
hot," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Royals' medical staff diagnosed the infection Friday and
prescribed antibiotics, and Percival said Saturday the irritation is
largely gone. Scioscia said the Angels are taking extra care to
ensure the infection does not recur and, given its proximity to
Percival's Achilles' tendon, it does not prevent him from pitching.</TE>
<TE>   Percival ranks second in the American League with 22 saves. When a
strained rib cage forced him onto the disabled list in April, Al
Levine earned three saves, but Levine is on the disabled list because
of a sore shoulder. He is scheduled to make rehabilitation
appearances with triple-A Salt Lake Tuesday and Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are believed to have discussed trades for left-handed
relievers Vic Darensbourg of the Florida Marlins and Dan Plesac of
the Philadelphia Phillies.</TE>
<TE>   Darensbourg, 31, has a 3.97 earned-run average and is guaranteed
$775,000 this year and $1.1 million next year. Plesac, 40, has a 4.63
ERA and a $2.2-million salary; he has said he plans to retire after
the season.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Cook's shoulder injury leaves Schoeneweis as the Angels'
lone left-handed reliever, but General Manager Bill Stoneman's search
for bullpen help might not necessarily lean to the left. Other
available left-handed relievers include Jeff Fassero of the Chicago
Cubs, Mark Guthrie of the New York Mets, Graeme Lloyd of the Marlins
and Ricardo Rincon of the Cleveland Indians.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's crucial to get another left-handed arm down
there," Scioscia said. "Bill's going to try to get the best pitcher
he can."</TE>
<TE>   A baseball source suggested the Indians might be interested in
trading right-handed reliever Paul Shuey to the Angels for pitcher
Matt Wise, demoted Thursday to triple-A, but the Angels are unlikely
to trade Wise. With Schoeneweis anchored in the bullpen for now, the
Angels want Wise to start every fifth day at Salt Lake so he could
fill in should an injury sideline one of the major league starters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rich Fischer, 21, threw his fourth shutout of the season Thursday
for the Angels' Class-A Rancho Cucamonga affiliate. Fischer, a
converted shortstop, leads the minor leagues in strikeouts, shutouts
and complete games.</TE>

<TE>   Update--The Avengers clinched a spot in the 12-team Arena Football
League playoffs last week, despite their 52-46 overtime loss to
Arizona. Victories in their final two games of the regular season and
one loss by New Jersey would give them a No. 4 seeding in the
playoffs and a bye in the first round. Indiana would have been the
No. 12-seeded team had the playoffs started Saturday. The Firebirds
are led by quarterback Raymond Philyaw, who has completed 244 of 415
passes for 2,960 yards and 54 touchdowns. They lost to San Jose,
52-41, last week after defeating Grand Rapids, 56-42, on June 29.
Quarterback Tony Graziani has completed 234 of 399 passes for 2,989
yards and 58 touchdowns for the Avengers, who have won three of their
last four games. Receiver Chris Jackson and lineman Chris Butterfield
will be back in the lineup after sitting out last week's game with
leg injuries.</TE>

<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't you want to just scream?</LD>
<LD>   Don't you want to just shout?</LD>
<LD>   Don't you want to just say, "Stop, Bud. We understand. We get the
message. We may not always believe it and we may be skeptical of the
timing, but we hear you. Please, you don't have to keep promoting
doomsday."</LD>
<TE>   It's just incredible.</TE>
<TE>   It's mid-July, and the man hasn't stopped since last November,
when only 48 hours after a glorious World Series he couldn't wait to
say his business was in such bad shape that two major league teams
would have to be eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone in the free world knew it couldn't happen, knew there
were too many legal issues, and yet there was Allan H. (Bud) Selig,
the commissioner of baseball, having already pulled the negotiating
rug from under his chief operating officer, Paul Beeston (who would
soon be shown the door), wasting months of valuable collective
bargaining time in pursuit of a plan destined to end up in the courts
and arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   There is no use re-chronicling familiar events.</TE>
<TE>   It is enough to say that here we are at the start of the second
half of the 2002 season, his beat goes on, and we have yet to see any
of the wolves he continues to cry about.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say that an occasional howl or two shouldn't be
heard in the distance.</TE>
<TE>   Are some clubs having financial problems? Of course.</TE>
<TE>   Have some had to take loans to meet expenses and payrolls, as
clubs always have--even when the commissioner at the time wasn't
selling a daily dose of doom? Certainly.</TE>
<TE>   Is it possible that baseball's line of credit has been strained?
Sure.</TE>
<TE>   I don't have to be convinced, as sources laid out, that the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays and Detroit Tigers obtained loans to meet their June
15 payrolls by using distributions from baseball's central funds as
collateral. Or that the Tigers also obtained a commercial loan,
secured by a guarantee from team owner and pizza entrepreneur Mike
Illitch, so that they could meet Monday's payroll.</TE>
<TE>   There is validity to that and a measure of validity to all of it,
but is it necessary to keep selling it at the expense of letting a
little light shine through?</TE>
<TE>   Has any commissioner in any sport ever engaged in so much
"negative promotion," as Marvin Miller described it in a recent
interview?</TE>
<TE>   In May, Selig told Times editors and reporters during a meeting
that six to eight clubs might go under in the near future.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, meeting with reporters in Milwaukee while absorbing
national abuse for calling the Tuesday night All-Star game after 11
innings with the score tied, 7-7, Selig said one club (Detroit) may
not be able to meet its Monday payroll while another (Tampa Bay)
could collapse before the season ended.</TE>
<TE>   It took only one day, however, for that crisis to be averted, with
Bob DuPuy, baseball's new COO, saying there was no immediate problem
for any team, creating speculation that the president may call these
guys the next time he needs help in crisis management.</TE>
<TE>   The impression was that doomsday had become a convenient way for
Selig to shift the spotlight from the All-Star controversy, and a
negotiating ploy as talks with the union were scheduled to begin the
next day.</TE>
<TE>   Selig insists baseball's economic problems go far beyond a
negotiating ploy, but a National League owner, asked if the doomsday
theme hadn't become a tired recording at a time when baseball could
use a positive message, said, "Well, he hasn't convinced the [union]
yet of the problems that we've got, so I guess he's entitled to keep
making these points until he can convince them. I think he's also
trying to convince the public, as well as the other side, that the
arguments he is making have validity to them.</TE>
<TE>   "So, possibly, the best way to get the other side to move is for
the other side to feel that the public understands the positions that
the commissioner has been taking. I'm sure there are a lot of people
in the business who get tired of hearing these same sort of
statements week after week after week, but there are a lot of casual
fans out there, and it's important to try and influence them as
well."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but it's more likely that skeptical fans, turned off by
work stoppages, soaring salaries and other issues detracting from the
game on the field, have tuned out a commissioner they have widely
ridiculed and that a similarly skeptical union won't be swayed by
doomsday prophecies alone.</TE>
<TE>   There is one hard fact that disputes doomsday.</TE>
<TE>   The industry had revenue of between $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion
last year.</TE>
<TE>   If the 30 teams truly had operating losses of $500 million on that
revenue, as management insists, then there would seem to be
widespread mismanagement, or the industry represents the worst
investment this side of Wall Street and should be shut down entirely.</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to believe that successful businessmen could lose
so much with that amount of revenue, even with the average player
salary now $2.4 million and the clubs owing about $1.7 billion in new
stadium debt.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, not all of that revenue is distributed evenly, and the
issues of increased revenue sharing and a luxury tax on high payrolls
are at the heart of the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is hard to find much optimism, and the union,
concerned that owners may be intent on unilaterally implementing new
work rules, is likely to set a strike date by the end of the month,
San Francisco Giant managing general partner Peter Magowan said
Friday he is "convinced sanity will prevail and we'll have an
agreement."</TE>
<TE>   Magowan said owners and players both have revenue sharing numbers
on the table and should be able to reach a compromise, and, since the
union recognized the "plight of the clubs" in agreeing to a modest
luxury tax experiment in the last contract, the union should
"certainly see the logic in agreeing to it now since the economic
plight of the clubs is so much worse than it was in 1994."</TE>
<TE>   Magowan wasn't painting a doomsday picture. He'll leave that to
Selig, a true artist.</TE>

<KH>AROUND THE HORN ROSS NEWHAN</KH>
<HD>Minaya Is Bright Spot for Expos</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Omar Minaya, the Montreal Expos' general manager, said Friday that he
had just received a call from Dodger executive Tom Lasorda
complimenting him on the aggressive job he has done in a difficult
situation and how it "meant a lot to me coming from a man of Tommy's
experiences and stature."</LD>
<LD>   Minaya, the former assistant general manager of the New York Mets
and director of pro and international scouting for the Texas Rangers,
has definitely attacked what was perceived to be a lame-duck
situation in Montreal. His recent acquisitions of Bartolo Colon and
Cliff Floyd, working within a $40-million budget that demands
creativity, are the biggest and brightest examples as the Expos make
a surprising playoff run while uncertain where they will be, or if
they will be, next year.</LD>
<LD>   There is a theory that a club under the direction of the
commissioner's office is simply trying to make its roster more
attractive to increase the price in a possible relocation auction.
Minaya said the only aim is for the Expos to go as far as they can.</LD>
<TE>   In the process, even if the Expos are eventually eliminated, he
has certainly enhanced his own resume and possibly accelerated
minority hiring in decision-making positions.</TE>
<TE>   In a year in which Minaya became the first Latino general manager,
Tony Pena and Luis Pujols became the first managers from the
Dominican Republic to manage against each other in the same game.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the commissioner is to be commended for making minority
hiring an issue and taking what some people thought was a real chance
in giving me this position," Minaya said.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, I've helped open the door a little more. Hopefully,
guys like Dave Stewart, Dave Wilder and Doc Rodgers will get the
opportunity I did."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart is the Milwaukee pitching coach and Toronto's former
assistant GM who has expressed frustration at his inability to land a
general manager's post. Wilder is Milwaukee's assistant GM, the same
position Rodgers holds in Cincinnati. All are African American.</TE>
<TE>   Of Thursday's trade for Floyd, Minaya said: "We have 71 games left
and [Manager Frank Robinson] felt we needed another hitter. [Making
the playoffs is] a longshot, but we're going to compete the best we
can, and if you're going to be in charge you can't be afraid to pull
the trigger. Historically, my background is in scouting and
development, but I've always been aggressive, and that will always
carry over whether I'm a general manager or working at McDonald's.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, my focus is on the Expos, I'm not worried about where
I'll be next year, but if people say, 'Hey, this guy has the ability
to do this,' I think that's a realistic part of it, too."</TE>
<TE>   Manuel's Labor</TE>
<TE>   The rebuilding Cleveland Indians staggered into the All-Star break
with General Manager Mark Shapiro saying he was "very happy" with his
manager, Charlie Manuel, and that "under very tough circumstances
he's retained his positivity and energy. I think he's done a good
job."</TE>
<TE>   The Indians hadn't played their first game of the second half when
Manuel was fired and replaced by coach Joel Skinner on an "interim"
basis--a term which probably could be applied to all 30 big league
managers considering the rate they are being fired.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel was the eighth to be dismissed since the start of spring
training, and it's possible that another Manuel--Jerry of the Chicago
White Sox--could be next, because he recently got a vote of
confidence from General Manager Kenny Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, maybe Jerry Narron in Texas or Hal McRae in Tampa Bay
will be next.</TE>
<TE>   Of the eight managers who have been brought on since the start of
spring training, only Pena in Kansas City and Grady Little in Boston
can be assured of retaining their job into next season, although it
appears Clint Hurdle will be re-signed by the Colorado Rockies.</TE>
<TE>   For the rest--Jerry Royster in Milwaukee, Pujols in Detroit,
Carlos Tosca in Toronto, Bruce Kimm with the Chicago Cubs and
Skinner--there is no certainty, and the fact that Kimm, who is
replacing Don Baylor, played with the Cubs, almost makes the
possibility of his retention ever more unlikely. He is the 22nd
former Cub to manage a team that last won a World Series in 1908,
when former Cub first baseman Frank Chance reached a managerial
pinnacle no other Cub alumnus has been able to match.</TE>
<TE>   In Cleveland, despite Shapiro's pre-break compliments, the
homespun Manuel mulled the club's refusal to commit to his status
beyond the second half and decided to force the general manager's
hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted them to put their stamp on me after the club traded
Bartolo Colon and changed directions," Manuel said.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking that stamp in a Thursday meeting with Shapiro, Manuel was
fired instead, rejecting a four-year offer to remain in the
organization as an instructor and leaving after having won 181 games
in his first two years at the Cleveland helm, including a division
title last year.</TE>
<TE>   No regrets.</TE>
<TE>   "Rebuilding is going to take two, three or four years," Manuel
said. "I felt I had to know if I was going to be included in those
plans. I felt my players, coaches and the team's employees needed to
know who the manager was going to be. I forced them to make a
decision, but they forced me to seek a decision."</TE>
<TE>   Said Shapiro: "We're in an awkward transitional period, having
been a club that thought it would contend [and] moving toward a club
that will still be rebuilding next year. In that environment and in
those circumstances, we couldn't make a commitment to Charlie."</TE>
<TE>   Debatable</TE>
<TE>   In the endless discussion over the All-Star game, Peter Magowan,
the San Francisco Giants' managing general partner, said the 7-7 tie
was a travesty and that the game needed to take a page from the past,
where both leagues play to win "rather than a Little League game
where everyone has to get in to please the parents."</TE>
<TE>   Can we please talk about strikes and steroids for a change?</TE>

complex in Tampa, Fla., for rehabilitation. Right-hander Mike Thurman
was recalled from triple-A Columbus to take Clemens' spot on the
roster.</LD>
<LD>   "There was no hesitation with Roger, it was the right thing to
do," Yankee Manager Joe Torre said. "He won't throw for five days,
but we're optimistic he'll be back soon."</LD>
<TE>   Mondesi was trying to shake off the effects of running into the
outfield wall when he chased Omar Vizquel's RBI triple in the 10th
inning that gave the Cleveland Indians a 2-1 victory Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Chest and neck X-rays on Mondesi were negative. He was not in the
starting lineup Saturday night and was not expected to play today.</TE>
<TE>   But Mondesi, acquired July 1 from Toronto, was optimistic that he
will return to the lineup soon.</TE>
<TE>   "It shouldn't take long to get back," he said. "I want to get out
and play."</TE>
<TE>   For Clemens, it is his sixth stint on the DL in 19 major league
seasons and third since joining the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   "Rest will help, but I've got to strengthen it," said Clemens, who
is 8-3 this season but winless in five starts since June 9. "Over the
[All-Star] break, I just totally rested. I was going crazy doing
nothing. This time, I'll ice it three or four days, then start
working."</TE>
<TE>   Clemens, 39, gave up only two hits in five scoreless innings, then
walked off the mound before the bottom of the sixth. He left his
previous start July 2 at Yankee Stadium after five innings with a leg
cramp.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Bonds remained in the hospital two days after having surgery
to remove a tumor from his kidney.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, the father of San Francisco slugger Barry Bonds and a
three-time All-Star during his 14-year major league career, had
surgery at Stanford Hospital on Thursday. His condition was not
released.</TE>
<TE>   "He's doing fine," Barry Bonds said Saturday before the San
Francisco Giants played the Colorado Rockies. "I'm going there after
the game."</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds said his father could be released next week. He did
not know whether the tumor was cancerous.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Bonds, 56, is a special assistant in the Giants' player
personnel department.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The St. Louis Cardinals activated outfielder J.D. Drew from the
disabled list and put pitcher Woody Williams on it Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Drew, on the DL since June 28 because of tendinitis in his right
knee, was not in the starting lineup Saturday against the San Diego
Padres.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, on the disabled list retroactive to July 7, is out
because of a left ribcage strain. He was injured last weekend against
the Dodgers and took himself out of the game after throwing warmup
pitches in the sixth inning. He is 6-3 with a 2.35 ERA in 76 2/3
innings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Met reliever Mark Corey was called back up to the majors
about two weeks after he collapsed from a seizure.</TE>
<TE>   Corey replaced Grant Roberts, who went on the disabled list with
tendinitis in his right shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Corey was hospitalized briefly after the seizure in a hotel
parking lot near Shea Stadium on June 26. After going on the DL, he
went on a minor-league rehabilitation stint.</TE>

<LD>The criminal element around the Port of Los Angeles had better
beware. The Shaq will be after you.</LD>
<LD>   That's 7-foot-1, 350-pound Shaquille O'Neal, who has just been
named a second-class reserve officer by the Port police department,
according to a report in the Daily Breeze.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal, 30, who has often said he wants to be a police officer,
has completed sufficient training to carry a gun and fight crime with
senior officers.</LD>
<TE>   "He can now ride as a second man in a port police car--not that he
can fit in it," said City Councilwoman Janice Hahn, who added that
Shaq's relationship with the police department is an excellent
recruiting tool.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the first American-born golfer to win the
British Open?</TE>
<TE>   Good idea: Tom FitzGerald said it in the San Francisco Chronicle:
"If regular games were stopped when both teams ran out of pitchers, a
Tigers-Devil Rays game wouldn't go six innings."</TE>
<TE>   More Bud Bashing: Michael Gee in the Boston Herald on Commissioner
Bud Selig's recent troubles: "Selig's week of horror is no surprise.
The commissioner is a delightful man who's less capable of running a
multi-billion dollar operation than the average preschooler. It's
understandable if regrettable that the owners felt one of their own
should be commissioner. But why did they pick a guy who by his own
admission couldn't make money in the baseball business?"</TE>
<TE>   History lesson: Jay Leno said it on the NBC "Tonight Show": "For
some of the younger people who don't remember, Hank Aaron is
considered the greatest hitter in baseball history who is not
currently frozen."</TE>
<TE>   Bad placement: On the same USA Today page last week was a story on
a Starwood Hotels &amp; Resort poll on chief executive officers who cheat
at golf, and an advertisement for Starwood Golf Vacations.</TE>
<TE>   Second thoughts: Former Laker A.C. Green promised to live a life
of celibacy before getting married. Nick Canepa of the San Diego
Union Tribune notes that, "A.C. has finally gotten himself hitched,
at the age of 38, and he supposedly kept the bargain he made with
himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm only guessing, but his thoughts now have to be something like
this: 'I must have been out of my mind.' "</TE>
<TE>   Angel report: Midseason thoughts from the Sporting News' Caught on
the Fly column:</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, sure the Halos've had a good first-half run, but Fly's
hedgin' bets on that gettin' parlayed into a second-half wild card.
The problem? Peekin' at what Mike Scioscia's been dealt shows a lotta
3s and 4s, but not a single ace--not a good hand when you're sittin'
at the table with Joe Torre, Grady Little and Art Howe."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Walter Hagen, in 1922.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: A four-month-old brown Nubian goat may be NASCAR's
next big promotional tool.</TE>
<TE>   The goat, named Lil' Dale, was born with a distinctive white 3,
the late Dale Earnhardt's number, on her right side.</TE>

<HD>Grand Jury Is Out</HD>
<DH>Woods will have to battle many elements in the third leg of
his historic journey, but the once-unthinkable is now possible</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GULLANE, Scotland</DL>
<LD>Hello everyone and welcome to the show. History is at stake here as
Tiger Woods takes on wily, windy, wonderful Muirfield, seeking to
capture the elusive third leg of golf's Grand Slam. In the next week,
you will see Tiger face up to challenges from the elements, his
nerves, the best players in the game and endure the sternest test of
his young career. So stay tuned. It's Tiger and the Slam.</LD>
<LD>   Or something like that.</LD>
<LD>   If the 131st British Open was just a television show instead of a
major championship golf tournament, chances are the script would be
kept pretty simple. You know how it goes. Tiger tees it up, Tiger
shoots under par, Tiger tames Muirfield, Tiger holds up the Claret
Jug, Tiger gets three-fourths of the way to the first Grand Slam of
modern golf.</LD>
<TE>   Only it simply won't be an easy thing for Woods, not at Muirfield,
not with all the pressure on him. The road will be bumpy and full of
holes, according to conventional wisdom ... and yet not everyone sees
it that way.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning majors, the Grand Slam, you have to be very, very
special," Arnold Palmer said. "And Tiger is very capable. There would
be no point in discussing this point about winning them all if we
didn't think it possible.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he is. There's no question about it. He's going to have
to be very, very sharp, but I think he can do it."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Nicklaus, whose hopes for a Grand Slam in 1972 ended when he
was second to Lee Trevino at the British Open at Muirfield, says
Woods has only one distinct edge.</TE>
<TE>   "The only advantage he has is he's a better player than everybody
else," Nicklaus said. "That's a pretty good advantage."</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the fact that Woods won four majors in a row (the
U.S. Open through the Masters) in 2000 and 2001, just not in a
calendar year. Nicklaus says that's quibbling with the history books.
So winning at Muirfield and then the PGA Championship in August might
be right up Woods' alley, according to Nicklaus.</TE>
<TE>   "I would think that it would be easier than what he did the first
time," Nicklaus said. "He's already done it, so he knows.</TE>
<TE>   "But you just don't walk on the first tee and say 'Guys, I'm here,
where's the trophy?' You have to play 72 holes. You have to bring
your 'A' game."</TE>
<TE>   Earl Woods ran down an alphabet-sized list of trouble spots that
await his son as he chases history at Muirfield. And every time he
mentioned an item, he seemed to discard it just as quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "One would likely say the weather, if it's bad, but Tiger
absolutely loves that kind of weather," said the elder Woods.</TE>
<TE>   "Personnel, meaning the media, but that wouldn't play either
because he has the opportunity to get away from it.</TE>
<TE>   "You would say food, but that's covered too.</TE>
<TE>   "Time differential ... he'll have adjusted.</TE>
<TE>   "Familiarity with links-type courses ... he actually loves them
because they bring out the creativity in him.</TE>
<TE>   "The competition ... the same, the competitors are the same.</TE>
<TE>   "His health, he's fine."</TE>
<TE>   So what are you saying, Earl?</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing can stop Tiger? That's an overstatement, of course, but
there can be no doubt that Woods is the heavy favorite to add another
major title to his overflowing collection of trophy hardware. At 26,
he has eight major championships and is clearly on a roll. He has won
the last two majors, six of the last nine and seven of the last 11.</TE>
<TE>   For Woods to win, or for anybody else, there are probably as many
factors to consider as there are bunkers at Muirfield. And there are
148 of those. But because Woods is the only player in the field
chasing down history in his Grand Slam pursuit, let's break his
chances for winning into five sections.</TE>
<TE>   The Pressure</TE>
<TE>   Make no mistake about it, the pressure is real. And no matter who
you are, it's not something you can avoid.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's anyone who plays the type of golf we're
talking about who doesn't feel the pressure," Palmer said. "Whether
it was Hogan or Nelson, Snead or anybody. Tiger is no different. He
just handles it better. That's what we're looking at right now.</TE>
<TE>   "For the most part, he's been able to shed that pressure and
that's the reason why he's as good as he is. He goes to that reserve
he has, his body and mind.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm saying is, a guy that knows where he's going and what he
wants to do and builds up to that point, he's got to really have
himself fixed for bad breaks, weather delays, whatever conditions
might be. It's easy after you lose to say, 'Well, I got a bad break.'
But that doesn't mean squat."</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus says Woods is facing pressure no different than what he
experienced at the Masters or at the U.S. Open. Competing at the
highest level in a major championship is simply pressure--or
something like it, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's what you thrive on," Nicklaus said. "I would call it more
excitement than pressure. How do you control what's in front of you?
And the excitement that's stirring within the golf world is neat,
which is what it is right now."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, there is another side to the pressure factor, which is
how Woods' competitors face up to it as they try to beat him. A case
in point was the last round of the Masters, where one by one, Retief
Goosen, Phil Mickelson, Ernie Els, Vijay Singh and Sergio Garcia
dropped out and allowed Woods to play in a conservative manner
because he was not challenged.</TE>
<TE>   "Superb," Earl Woods called Tiger's closing round at Augusta. "It
was textbook."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, the elder Woods continued, Tiger is accustomed to being
the one being chased.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there will be any more players than usual shooting
for him. They're always shooting for him anyway, trying to knock off
the top dog. Everybody is doing their damnedest to do it.</TE>
<TE>   "For Tiger, it is merely a matter of concentration and focus and
being able to function under that kind of scrutiny and pressure. Very
few people can do it. He has the ability to do it."</TE>
<TE>   The Course</TE>
<TE>   Since Muirfield last staged the Open Championship in 1992, 30
yards have been added to two par-three holes (the fourth and the
13th), but that's it, as far as length. The course measures 7,034
yards.</TE>
<TE>   It is reasonable to assume that the Royal &amp; Ancient is counting on
the wind to make Muirfield a far more stern test. There has been
minor tweaking, though, mainly to the bunkers. Of the 148 bunkers, 80
have been reworked and made steeper. The fairways, Nicklaus says,
will be narrowed in the normal landing areas, but he says the real
problem is the deep rough.</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus believes Muirfield will suit Woods.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a golf course he will do well on," Nicklaus said, if Woods
doesn't spend too much time in the rough.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care if you're Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus or King Kong,
if it's knee-high rough, you're not going to get out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer also pointed out the rough as a major problem.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be very tough," he said. "Under the circumstances,
it's just my thinking, but the R&amp;A and the people at Muirfield are
going to be prepared for Tiger.... They're going to make it as tough
as they possibly can.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's a double-edged sword. If there's anyone who can handle
it as tough as it is, it's Tiger."</TE>
<TE>   The Weather</TE>
<TE>   It has been wet in Scotland and the rain has softened the course
and probably taken some of the run out of the fairways and the
hardness out of the greens. And the rough is likely to be lush
instead of scraggly.</TE>
<TE>   And if the wind blows and it rains during the tournament, whose
advantage is it?</TE>
<TE>   Woods shot a 66 on a bad weather Saturday at the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Woods also prevailed at the U.S. Open at Bethpage Black, which
wasn't exactly a postcard for good weather.</TE>
<TE>   If it rains and the wind blows, then the rain falls on everyone
and the wind blows at every player. Earl Woods says the weather might
not be as important a factor as something else--luck.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all subject to the whim of a bounce or a gust of wind or a
blade of grass.... You can prepare like hell, but those are the
things that do it."</TE>
<TE>   His Health</TE>
<TE>   Woods missed the Western Open outside Chicago last week because of
flu-like symptoms. He left home Tuesday for a fishing trip in Ireland
and a couple of practice rounds whenever he could fit them in.</TE>
<TE>   The last time Woods played in competition was the U.S. Open five
weeks ago. It should be noted that in 1972, when Nicklaus came to
Muirfield halfway to the Grand Slam, he had not played since the U.S.
Open either.</TE>
<TE>   Earl Woods says Tiger's health is what would concern him the most.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the factor that gets me all the time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His Game</TE>
<TE>   Nobody is playing better. Besides winning the first two majors
this year, Woods leads the PGA Tour in scoring average (68.63),
greens in regulation, final-round scoring average (68.20) and
percentage of par-five holes that he birdies (52.4%). What's more,
Woods is also second in total driving, a combination of distance and
accuracy, trailing Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer says the important thing to watch is how Woods bounces back
if he hits a poor shot.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen him pull-hook a couple of shots and I'm sure he is
quite aware he can't do that too often to do what he is trying to
do," Palmer said. "If that pops up, he has to be prepared to take
care of that.</TE>
<TE>   "But there's no question about it, he's going to have to be very
sharp. I think he can do it. No one has ever done it. But here's a
man who has a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus says the only obstacle Woods is facing is himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is any bigger obstacle," Nicklaus said.
"Tiger will try to do the best he can to prepare himself and his golf
game to do his very best. Now, sometimes I played my best and I got
beat ... at Turnberry [by Tom Watson in 1977], at Pebble Beach [by
Watson in 1982]. But Tiger goes over and plays his 'A' game, he's a
better player than they are, he will either win on his own merits or
not win the tournament on his own merits. He's going to have other
guys that play well, but he's the only thing he can control."</TE>
<TE>   Earl Woods says the mental part of Tiger's game should be sharp
because he already knows he can win majors--and win four in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "He's already done it," Earl Woods said. "If you know it's doable,
that's 80% of the battle."</TE>
<TE>   And the battle begins Thursday, when Woods' quest for history
brings him to one of the legendary layouts in golf. Like most
everyone else, Earl Woods is eager to see what transpires.</TE>
<TE>   "That is something that comes along once in a lifetime. There has
been nothing like this in the past. Nicklaus, when he won the first
two, it's really not the same. Nicklaus was depending totally on
hitting fairways and greens. If Tiger can have his short game [on],
that's the cure-all for a whole lot of sins, so his chances are much
better than Nicklaus' were, in my opinion."</TE>
<TE>   We have a week to find out. Until it happens, everything is
speculation, but that's usually what you find on the road to a Grand
Slam.</TE>

<DH>Discharge papers in hand, the Ducks' top pick in 2001 draft
is finally free to sign</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stanislav Chistov caught sight of the Statue of Liberty during his
first days in New York. He was making the standard tourist rounds
last month after a year of turmoil that began when the Mighty Ducks
made him the fifth overall pick in the 2001 NHL draft.</LD>
<LD>   His Russian team reacted by announcing he was in the army, which
would prevent Chistov from signing an NHL contract. The army reacted
by taking him from a Moscow hotel room, stealing him so he could play
for its team. The Ducks reacted with concern, not knowing if the
multi-talented forward would ever play for them.</LD>
<LD>   Chistov didn't react. He waited.</LD>
<TE>   Now, after living through that tug of cold war, he was looking at
that give-me-your-tired symbol. It might have been a moment to
ponder--free at last. Except he merely glimpsed at the figure from
the shore, then it was off to the wax museum to see Charlie Chaplin.</TE>
<TE>   "I only saw the Statue of Liberty from afar," Chistov said through
a translator in a telephone interview. "I am very aware of what it
means to people in this country, especially with what happened in
September."</TE>
<TE>   But ...</TE>
<TE>   "I like the Hollywood stars at the museum the best, especially
Charlie Chaplin," Chistov said. "His movies are great, because you
don't have to speak English to enjoy them. I can understand them
pretty well."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it was more fitting. Chistov understands the comedy he has
been through as well.</TE>
<TE>   He meandered like the little tramp through the pratfalls of
Russian hockey politics and the pitfalls of those shenanigans. Now,
with discharge papers in hand, he hopes to embark on his American
dream. The Ducks have until Monday to sign him under the NHL
agreement with the International Ice Hockey Federation. They can
extend the negotiation period to Aug. 15 by paying a fee to the IIHF.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a very difficult year," Chistov said. "I always knew
I did nothing wrong. I did everything by the book. But there was a
lot of uncertainty, a lot of mental stress, the past year. I just
wanted to play.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole army thing, the only thing I want to say is it's behind
me. The only thing I am confident about is I have completed my
service to my country. I am free and clear to play in America at
last."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is how Chistov plays the game that made him a pawn on skates.</TE>
<TE>   He was a child prodigy who scored a goal in his first game as a
7-year-old. He helped Avangard Omsk reach the league championship
series in 2000-01 for the first time in the team's 50-year history.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2001 NHL draft, four Omsk players were taken in the first
41 picks, including Alexander Svitov by Tampa Bay at No. 3 and
Chistov at No. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Chistov flew to Anaheim to have an injured knee examined and
rehabilitate. Svitov flew to Tampa Bay and signed a three-year
contract. And Anatoly Bardin, president of Omsk, flew into a rage.</TE>
<TE>   He sent word that both players should return to Russia or they
would be considered AWOL from the army. It was the first time that
Anaheim and Tampa Bay officials were told the two were in the army
and they were a little suspicious. Compulsory military service is the
only thing that prevents a player from signing with an NHL team under
the agreement with the IIHF.</TE>
<TE>   Bardin bragged to Russian reporters: "Bardin 1, NHL 0."</TE>
<TE>   This, NHL officials said, was about rubles. Club teams from other
countries receive a $100,000 fee when a player signs with an NHL
team. The speculation was that Bardin wanted more.</TE>
<TE>   Bardin claimed he was battling for the future of Russian hockey.</TE>
<TE>   All Chistov knew was he was being called a deserter by Omsk
officials</TE>
<TE>   "I was disappointed I had to leave," Chistov said. "My only reason
to come Anaheim was rehab the knee, to get it 100% healthy. The
medical help in the U.S. could get me healthier a lot faster. I was
going back to Omsk and play at least one more year."</TE>
<TE>   Chistov, who declined to say whether he was really in the army
when he was drafted, was sent to boot camp for 11 days on his return.</TE>
<TE>   "The future seemed uncertain," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Things went from uncertain to bleak with a knock on his hotel room
door in early November.</TE>
<TE>   Chistov had rejoined Omsk for three games and the team was in
Moscow. Members of the Moscow militia showed up at his hotel and took
away him, Svitov and defenseman Kiril Kostov, who also had been
inducted into the army.</TE>
<TE>   The three were taken to a nearby base.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone came to my door and told me there were army officers
downstairs and they wanted me to go with them," Chistov said. "It
wasn't a request.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't really sure what was going on. I had a feeling. From the
day I got back with Omsk, things were never the same. I was treated
very differently. I knew things weren't going to be the same until I
left."</TE>
<TE>   Bardin complained that "we are witnessing the old Soviet hockey
system."</TE>
<TE>   It was nothing so sinister. The army decided that if the players
were indeed in the army, they would play for the army's team in the
Russian Super League.</TE>
<TE>   Chistov and Svitov did not play again as a court battle ensued
and, finally, the Russian defense minister ordered the players to be
given back to Omsk. Instead, the two chose to sit and work out with
the army's second division team.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing you can do in that kind of situation but wait,"
Duck General Manager Bryan Murray said. "It was a lot tougher winter
than it should have been for him."</TE>
<TE>   Agent Jay Grossman finally secured the release of Chistov and
Svitov. Both hastily traveled to New York. Grossman said he did not
buy the players out of the army, as has been the case with other
Russian players.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There were concerns that the time off would damage Chistov's
development, but they disappeared during the World Juniors last
winter, when he led Russia to the championship. He scored four goals
and had 12 points in the tournament, including the game-tying goal
against Canada in the championship game, and was named the
tournament's MVP.</TE>
<TE>   "We were concerned because he hadn't played in more than a month,"
said Alain Chainey, the Ducks' director of scouting. "He looked a
little rusty in the first game. By the end of the tournament, he was
doing magical stuff.</TE>
<TE>   "The kid had a nice future. We just had to get him out of Russia."</TE>
<TE>   Chistov is out and waits for his chance. He has been to New York,
Phoenix and is now in Toronto working out, hoping that the
multimillion-dollar deal gets done.</TE>
<TE>   It is all a long way from Chelyabinsk, where Chistov first saw a
Charlie Chaplin movie at the age of 13. It's a factory city and his
parents are factory workers. Michael, his father, is on state
disability after a crate fell on him, severely injuring his right
arm. Larissa, his mother, operates a crane.</TE>
<TE>   Sports were not a big part of family life. But Chistov had hockey
dangled before him while walking to school when he was 7.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an accident," Chistov said. "A local club coach was out
looking for players. He asked me if I was interested. I didn't know.
I went to school and thought about it and it sounded better and
better as the day went on. I went and signed up right after school. I
didn't even tell my parents.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time I played, I scored and the feeling I got was
amazing. I knew this was something I wanted to do."</TE>
<TE>   Chistov joined the city's top club development team and was
playing for the junior national team by the time he was 15. He joined
Omsk when he was 17.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks ignored concern about Chistov's size--he was 5 feet 9,
178 pounds at the time. They weren't alone. Murray, then Florida's
general manager, considered drafting him.</TE>
<TE>   "I shouldn't say these things before we get him under contract,
but he has got a sense for a game," Murray said. "He has that quality
where the play around him always seems to be creative.</TE>
<TE>   "He got caught up in all that stuff and had to stay there. But at
the end of the day, we get a good hockey player."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Get Ejected From the Top Spot</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Tracy isn't around at the finish, but Kim is
again, as Diamondbacks make it three in a row, 7-5.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers' three-week reign atop the National League West came to a
frustrating end Saturday afternoon, as Arizona closer Byung-Hyun Kim
quelled a ninth-inning uprising and the Diamondbacks held off the
Dodgers, 7-5, before 33,994 in Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   A rocky start by Andy Ashby and shoddy relief work by reliever
Terry Mulholland left two Dodger pitchers dejected, and another blown
call, this one by second-base umpire Bill Miller, led to Manager Jim
Tracy getting ejected, as the Dodgers' losing streak grew to a
season-high four games.</LD>
<LD>   Reserve outfielder David Dellucci took advantage of a rare start,
hitting a two-run homer in the fourth inning and an RBI single in the
sixth, and backup catcher Rod Barajas ripped a two-run homer off
Mulholland in the sixth to provide the difference for the
Diamondbacks, who won the first three games of a critical four-game
series and moved into first place, a half-game ahead of the Dodgers.</LD>
<TE>   "We're at that point in the season where every game counts, and
that's the way we like it," Dellucci said. "We like this spot. We
know what we're capable of and what we're up against."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers thought they knew what they were up against--the
defending World Series champion Diamondbacks--but the opposition, at
least in their minds, was not limited to those in the visiting
dugout.</TE>
<TE>   First-base umpire Bill Hohn blew a call that prevented the Dodgers
from scoring the tying run in the eighth inning of Thursday night's
4-3 loss, and Miller's miscue was costly Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   With Arizona leading, 4-2, Steve Finley opened the sixth with a
walk and stole second. Finley beat Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca's
throw, but he popped off the bag after his slide while shortstop
Cesar Izturis was still applying the tag.</TE>
<TE>   Miller stuck with his call, which replays showed was wrong, and
Tracy's emotional objection earned him a trip to his office. Mark
Grace flied to right, but Dellucci singled in a run, and Barajas
greeted Mulholland with his home run to give the Diamondbacks a 7-2
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Grudzielanek's RBI single and Hiram Bocachica's pinch-hit,
two-run homer pulled the Dodgers within 7-5 in the seventh, and the
Dodgers put two on with two out in the ninth, but Kim got Lo Duca to
ground to first to end the game and record his 25th save, and third
in as many games.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not one to berate an umpire as quickly as I did today unless
I'm awfully certain I'm right," Tracy said. "Frankly, I could see
that from the dugout. Obviously, it was a missed call."</TE>
<TE>   That cost the Dodgers a run and maybe more. Had Dellucci's single
come with two out and no one on, perhaps Ashby would have stayed in
to pitch to Barajas. Instead, bench coach Jim Riggleman summoned
Mulholland, whose second pitch was blasted for a home run.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a three-run call," Dodger first baseman Eric Karros
said. "Instead of two outs and a guy on first and Ashby pitching
against Barajas ... it changed the whole complexion of the game.
Obviously, [the umpires] are going to make mistakes. It's unfortunate
it happened twice in a three-game span in a big series."</TE>
<TE>   Crew chief Larry Young's assessment of the play fueled Karros'
frustration. Told that Young said replays were "pretty inconclusive,"
Karros said, "Oh my God, pretty inconclusive? You've got to be
[kidding] me."</TE>
<TE>   There was nothing inconclusive about Ashby's performance. It was
bad. The right-hander gave up six runs and eight hits, including
Grace's two-run single in the second, in 5 1/3 innings, walking three
and striking out one. All three of the batters he walked scored.</TE>
<TE>   "It's embarrassing," Ashby (7-7) said. "When you fall behind and
walk guys, good things aren't going to happen. I couldn't find my
rhythm.... I was all over the place. I need to stop thinking and let
it happen."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are in danger of getting swept by the Diamondbacks,
and while four losses at this point in the season won't eliminate the
Dodgers from contention, a sweep could erase much of the momentum
they built in the first half and provide the Diamondbacks with a
second-half catapult.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is going to leave here with the NL West title under their
belts," Karros said. "It's going to be a dogfight until the end, and
all three teams, Arizona, San Francisco and us, will change places
more than once. We'd like to mix in a win soon, though. [Today] would
be a nice time to do it."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Mulholland May Be Left Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reliever Terry Mulholland is caught in a vicious cycle. The
left-hander has not pitched well enough to earn the confidence of
Manager Jim Tracy, who has been reluctant to use him in anything but
mop-up situations, and he has not pitched often enough to find any
kind of rhythm or consistency.</LD>
<LD>   At some point this summer, that cycle probably will end. The
Dodgers hope to trade for a reliever, and Mulholland, despite his
$3-million salary, would be released if a deal is made.</LD>
<LD>   But the Dodgers might also look to triple-A Las Vegas in an effort
to bolster their bullpen, with right-handers Kevin Beirne (7-2, 4.27
earned-run average) or Bryan Corey (3-1, 4.61 ERA) the most likely
candidates to replace Mulholland.</LD>
<TE>   Mulholland, who pitched once in the previous 13 days, relieved
starter Andy Ashby in the sixth inning Saturday with the Dodgers
trailing, 5-2. His second pitch to Rod Barajas was deposited over the
left-field wall for a two-run homer, the decisive runs in Arizona's
7-5 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland, who has an 8.88 ERA in 17 games, never recovered from
his brutal start, when he gave up 11 runs and 12 hits, including five
home runs, in 4 2/3 innings of his first two games. He spent May on
the disabled list because of back spasms and has been a non-factor in
the bullpen since his early June return.</TE>
<TE>   "Physically, I'm fine--there's no excuse for what's happening
now," Mulholland said. "I can't afford to make one or two mistakes.
When you only pitch once every seven or eight days, those [mistakes]
tend to stick in people's minds, especially when you're not out there
enough to give them something good to remember."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hiram Bocachica's pinch-hit two-run homer in the seventh inning
Saturday couldn't have come at a better time for the reserve
outfielder. With the Dodgers close to a trade for Texas Ranger
utility player Frank Catalanotto, Bocachica's days with the Dodgers
could be numbered.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are expected to send triple-A second baseman Joe
Thurston to the Rangers for Catalanotto, who is batting .260 with two
homers and 14 runs batted in but missed a month and a half because of
groin and back injuries.</TE>
<TE>   To clear roster room for Catalanotto, the Dodgers' most likely
move--at least, before Saturday--would have been to designate
Bocachica for assignment in hopes he would clear waivers and be sent
to Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Bocachica has only 63 at-bats--he's hitting .222 with four homers
and eight RBIs--and has started only 11 games, but his loss would
leave the Dodger bench with no power from the right side on the days
Marquis Grissom starts in the outfield. More hits like Saturday's
could force the Dodgers to keep Bocachica and release infielder Jeff
Reboulet if a trade for bench help is consummated.</TE>

<DH>Dodgers: Beltre is still struggling with the bat and the
club might be forced to make a change at third base soon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers don't want to make major changes in a tight National
League West race, but struggling third baseman Adrian Beltre is
forcing their hand.</LD>
<LD>   Talent and potential aren't enough in July when the Arizona
Diamondbacks and San Francisco Giants are turning up the heat,
prompting difficult decisions for Manager Jim Tracy and General
Manager Dan Evans.</LD>
<LD>   The Diamondbacks applied more pressure with a 7-5 victory Saturday
before 33,994 at Dodger Stadium, taking their third in a row in the
series and retaking the division lead from the Dodgers, who have
dropped a season-high four in a row.</LD>
<TE>   Beltre singled in three at-bats to raise his average to .236, and
that's probably not going to cut it much longer, even though he is
still the club's best option at third. Evans has spoken with other
clubs in an attempt to bolster the position, baseball sources said,
inquiring about Edgardo Alfonzo of the New York Mets.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers hope Beltre begins to meet their high expectations,
because they need something from him or someone else at third with
their first playoff berth in six years at stake.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to go out there and kid myself, because I know I'm
not doing good right now," Beltre said. "I would like to be out there
every day, but if [Tracy] has to make some decisions, he's the boss.
There's nothing I can do about it.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't have to ask me, he doesn't have to ask [anybody]. He
makes the decisions, so what can I do about it? I can be happy, I can
be mad, whatever, but things are not going to change. He makes the
lineup."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy continues to preach patience, but his is running thin.</TE>
<TE>   "We are 91 games into a season of which we are involved in a
playoff situation, as we sit here and speak, so production becomes
necessary," Tracy said. "We need production, because we're interested
in playing baseball in October."</TE>
<TE>   Beltre hasn't produced consistently since batting .304 in April.
He batted .207 in May, .205 in June and is at .235 this month. Beltre
has eight home runs, 31 runs batted in and a .287 on-base percentage,
prompting Tracy to bat him eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "You continue to encourage him, continue to send him out there and
continue to play him," Tracy said. "He has more at-bats [330] and
plate appearances [360] than anyone else on the ballclub. I don't
know what else you could do. I really don't."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers thought so much of Beltre that they falsified
documents, violating major league rules, to sign him at 15. He made
his big-league debut at 19 in 1998, and appeared to be on the verge
of stardom after batting .290 with 20 homers, 30 doubles and 85 RBIs
in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   However, at 23, Beltre seems to be regressing. He played in only
126 games last season after an appendectomy and a second surgery for
an infection that caused him to lose 30 pounds, and is still working
his way back.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers insist they are not ready to give up on Beltre, whom
sources said they would have to include in any deal for an impact
hitter, such as Alfonzo. They're less emphatic about keeping him in
the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "Just as Trace did with me last year, there were games where he
looked at matchups and played [Paul] Lo Duca and [Dave Hansen]
sometimes, and it's not just to single out one or two guys," first
baseman Eric Karros said. "The bottom line is, if you're producing
you'll be run out there. If you're not, we've got to go with the hot
hand. Trace has got a responsibility to the whole organization. We're
well into the season now, so we'll see how it goes."</TE>

<HD>Everything Turns Out All Right for Galaxy</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Hendrickson scores in L.A.'s 3-1 victory at
Colorado with inspiration from reggae legend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Bob Marley is making on-field appearances for the Galaxy, then
it's fair to assume that every little thing's gonna be all right for
the perennial Major League Soccer power. At least on the nights he
shows up.</LD>
<LD>   The late reggae crooner materialized in the 69th minute of the
Galaxy's 3-1 victory at Colorado on Saturday night, after Ezra
Hendrickson scored the game winner. The defender from St. Vincent &amp;
the Grenadines celebrated his first goal of the year by lifting his
game jersey to reveal his multihued T-shirt with Marley's mug on the
front, a practice he began last year.</LD>
<LD>   How good was every little thing for the Galaxy in front of 11,168
at Denver's Invesco Field? In winning its first road game since May
11, the Galaxy ended a 348-minute scoreless drought on the road
dating to June 1.</LD>
<TE>   The Galaxy (8-7-2, 26 points) averted falling into last place in
the Western Conference with the victory over the Rapids (8-9-1, 25
points) and moved into third.</TE>
<TE>   It was all made possible by the Galaxy playing perhaps its most
complete game of the year on a night when familiar, albeit recently
banished faces, played big roles.</TE>
<TE>   Playmaking midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos, making his first start
since June 15, had two assists and defender Danny Califf, starting
his second consecutive match after being benched for three games,
scored his first goal.</TE>
<TE>   Midfielder Cobi Jones had three assists for his first points since
returning to the Galaxy from the World Cup and forward Carlos Ruiz
scored his 13th goal.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy's goals came after midfielder Chris Henderson gave the
Rapids a 1-0 lead in the 29th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Six minutes later, Califf tied the score, 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   After Cienfuegos passed to Jones on the left sideline, Jones
unleashed a cross pass to the top of the goalkeeper's box. Califf
out-jumped defender Ritchie Kotschau and headed the ball into the
right side of the net.</TE>
<TE>   Hendrickson's score came off a Jones pass from the right side into
the middle of the field at the top of the penalty area.</TE>
<TE>   Hendrickson, who received the ball on the run, blew by Kotschau
before firing a high shot past goalkeeper Scott Garlick and into the
top of the net.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt good to finally score one," Hendrickson told ESPN radio.
"I had a chance to score today and from that same angle, I've scored
that goal so many different times now. I saw some guys open in the
box, but at the position I was, maybe six yards out, I just felt to
go top corner."</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, who is tied for the league lead in goals (13) with New
England's Taylor Twellman and for second in points (26) with Dallas'
Jason Kreis, finished off the Rapids in the 71st minute.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz stepped in front of former Galaxy defender Robin Fraser to
head in a pass from Cienfuegos.</TE>
<TE>   "Scoring three goals on the road, that's big time," Hendrickson
said. "We be jammin', man. We be jammin'."</TE>

<HD>McCullough Eyes a Major Breakthrough</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike McCullough figures he just has to keep doing what he's already
done three times to win his first major.</LD>
<LD>   He shot a five-under-par 67 Saturday at Dearborn, Mich., to reach
12-under and take a one-stroke lead into the final round of the
Senior Players Championship, the fourth and final Senior PGA Tour
major. McCullough is the only player to break 70 in every round.</LD>
<LD>   Hubert Green shot one-under one day after tying the course record
with a 63 and beginning the third round with a three-stroke lead.
Green, who will begin today one stroke behind McCullough, knows it
wouldn't be wise to just focus on beating McCullough because the TPC
of Michigan is susceptible to low scores.</LD>
<TE>   "If I worry about Mike McCullough and he shoots 73, and somebody
shoots a 64, we're going to be looking at each other and not making a
big check," Green said.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart Ginn is alone in third at eight-under after shooting 70.</TE>
<TE>   Two-time champion Raymond Floyd, who had the best day with a 65,
is at seven-under along with Doug Tewell, Larry Nelson and
first-round leader Hale Irwin. Irwin hasn't broken par since setting
nine-hole and first-round records on Thursday. Jim Thorpe is at
six-under with Bob Murphy.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough, who never won a tournament on the PGA Tour, won the
Mexico Senior Classic and the Emerald Coast Classic last year. His
best finish this season has been a tie for second at the BellSouth
Senior Classic last month and he has three other top-10 finishes.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Allen Doyle shot a 69 and trails by eight shots
along with Fuzzy Zoeller and three others.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Sluman fired an eight-under-par 63 to take a two-stroke lead
over Steve Lowery (64) after three rounds at the Greater Milwaukee
Open.</TE>
<TE>   Sluman also was the leader after 54 holes last year only to shoot
a one-over 72 on Sunday to finish in a tie for 10th. This time,
thanks to his 54-hole GMO record 193 total, he's within range of the
tournament record of 24-under. Loren Roberts carded a 260 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Sluman said he's playing some of the best golf of his 20-year PGA
Tour career.</TE>
<TE>   "Scoring-wise, this is pretty close," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Triplett, who began the day tied with Sluman and Tommy Armour
III atop the leaderboard, shot a four-under 67 and is alone in third
place four strokes back. Armour shot an even-par 71, falling eight
strokes back.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Chalmers (65) is five strokes behind in fourth place, and Tim
Herron (65) is in fifth, trailing by six strokes. J.P. Hayes, of
Appleton, Wis., fired a 63 to move to 10-under and a tie for sixth
with David Peoples (67). Hayes finished with a tournament record
seven-under 28 on the front nine.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fredrik Jacobson had the lead in the Scottish Open, just not the
margin he wanted, after a par 71 at Luss, Scotland, that let at least
10 players back into the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobson started the third round with a four-stroke lead. After
making a five-foot par putt on the final hole, his lead was down to
one over Eduardo Romero of Argentina, and nine other players were
within four shots. Jacobson is at 11-under 202.</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Lyle, playing in the final group on the weekend for the
first time in 10 years, watched his hopes vanish by taking two double
bogeys on the back nine. On both holes, he took four shots to get
down from 20 feet. The former Masters and British Open champion
finished with a 75 and fell eight behind.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Karrie Webb, who has won as many LPGA Tour events as Beth Bauer
has played, shot a five-under 66 to share the lead with the rookie
after the third round of the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic at Sylvania,
Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Webb, with 27 wins in her seven-year career, jumped from being
just another name on the leaderboard to the top spot with a string of
four birdies on the back nine. For good measure, she hit a wedge to
six inches on the par-five closing hole--prompting the largest roar
of the day from the gallery. When she tapped in for birdie, she had
the lead to herself for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   One of the brightest young players on the tour, Bauer started the
day two shots behind Laura Diaz and tied for second place. Bauer
completed a 67 to match Webb at 10-under 203.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel Teske, one of Webb's rivals back in their amateur days in
Australia, shot a 64 to move a shot back at 204. Heather Bowie had a
66 and was at 205. First-round leader Diaz and Kelli Kuehne were at
206.</TE>
<TE>   Kris Tschetter, tied for second after shooting 65 in the first
round, was disqualified when she didn't have her playing partner,
Jeanne-Marie Busuttil, sign her scorecard.</TE>

<DH>Horse racing: Jockey guides Gold Mover to victory in the
Princess Rooney and Royal Lad to a win in the Carry Back.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry Bailey, the runaway leader in purse earnings among jockeys
again this year, padded his advantage Saturday in Florida.</LD>
<LD>   Bailey won two of the four biggest races during Calder's $1.4
million Summit of Speed, taking the $400,000 Princess Rooney Handicap
with Gold Mover and the $250,000 Carry Back with Royal Lad.</LD>
<LD>   In the Princess Rooney, Gold Mover, the 9-5 second choice, held
off 2-5 favorite Xtra Heat, winning by half a length in a
stakes-record 1:10 1/5.</LD>
<TE>   Royal Lad, the 5-2 second choice, took the lead with a quarter of
a mile to go in the Carry Back and went on to defeat 2-1 favorite and
California shipper Captain Squire by 1 1/4 lengths in 1:10 3/5.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Orientate, the 2-1 second choice, dominated his six
rivals in the $400,000 Smile Sprint Handicap, winning by six lengths
in 1:09 4/5 for the six furlongs. Owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis and
trained by Wayne Lukas, Orientate was ridden by Mike Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Echo Eddie, the 3-1 third choice under jockey David Flores, saved
the place by a head over 9-10 favorite Crafty C.T., who was ridden by
Bailey.</TE>
<TE>   It was Lukas' first victory at Calder since he won the What A
Pleasure Stakes with Reaffirming in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   In the $250,000 Azalea Breeders' Cup Stakes, Bold World, the 5-2
second choice, rolled to an 8 1/2-length victory over favored Willa
On The Move.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With jockey Jose Valdivia Jr. sidelined for the weekend because of
a sprained left wrist suffered in a spill in Friday night's second
race, Alex Solis picked up some easy cash Saturday at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Solis inherited the mount on Full Moon Madness, the 3-10 favorite
in the $82,173 Answer Do Stakes. Winning the race for the second time
in three years, the 7-year-old gelding beat 16-1 longshot
McCordnskuba by a length.</TE>
<TE>   Full Moon Madness has won 14 of 34.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Whitmore's Conn, the second longest shot in the field at nearly
15-1, overtook the pacesetters late to win the $150,000 Bowling Green
Handicap at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Trained by Randy Schulhofer, the 4-year-old Kris S. colt completed
the 1 3/8 miles on turf in 2:13 2/5 under jockey Shaun Bridgmohan.</TE>
<TE>   Staging Post, the 5-2 favorite making his first start since
finishing second in the San Juan Capistrano at Santa Anita on April
21, was second for trainer Bobby Frankel.</TE>
<TE>   Startac, making his first start for trainer Bill Mott, was fourth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the scenarios for today's 63rd Hollywood Gold Cup is Sky Jack
going to an early lead and never giving it up, much the way Marquetry
and jockey David Flores won the 1 1/4-mile race in 1991.</LD>
<LD>   Marquetry, who beat favored Farma Way by a head at the wire, paid
$56.80, the highest win mutuel in Gold Cup history. The trainer of
Marquetry was Bobby Frankel, whose Milwaukee Brew, a late-running
5-year-old, has the task of trying to overhaul the Doug
O'Neill-trained Sky Jack and jockey Laffit Pincay.</LD>
<LD>   Frankel, however, sees no similarity between today's $750,000 Gold
Cup and the 1991 edition, which was worth $1 million.</LD>
<TE>   "When Marquetry ran," Frankel said, "there was other speed in the
race, but nobody wanted to go with him. This time, Sky Jack's about
the only speed there is. This race reminds me more of the one I ran
in last weekend in New York."</TE>
<TE>   He was referring to the $500,000 Suburban Handicap at Belmont
Park, which was won by E Dubai via a front-end ride from John
Velazquez. Frankel's late-running Lido Palace made up some ground in
the stretch but fell three-quarters of a length short of E Dubai at
the wire.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel, who won his second Gold Cup last year, when Futural was
disqualified for interference in the stretch and the stewards hung up
Aptitude's number, was slightly cheered Thursday when trainer Bruce
Headley, at a supplementary cost of $25,000, plus $7,500 in entry and
starting fees, dropped Dig For It's name into the Gold Cup. Dig For
It, who is 15-1 on the morning line, is a 7-year-old who has won only
six of 43 starts, but five of the wins have come at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   "Dig For It has a little bit of speed," Frankel said. "Maybe he'll
run with Sky Jack for a while."</TE>
<TE>   Dig For It's last race produced a narrow win in allowance company
June 6, when he contested the early pace. But the last time Dig For
It ran in a Grade I race, in the Santa Anita Handicap in March, he
showed no speed and finished 11th.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee Brew, in his second start after his owner, Frank
Stronach, moved the horse from his East Coast trainer, Joe Orseno, to
Frankel, ended an eight-race, 19-month losing streak by winning the
Big 'Cap. The horse could join some exclusive company by winning the
Big 'Cap and the Gold Cup in the same year. Only four horses have
done so. Only five others have won both races in different years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The first horse to win the Santa Anita Handicap and Gold Cup in
the same year was Noor, who was elected into the Racing Hall of Fame
in April and will be enshrined at Saratoga Springs, N.Y., next month.
In 1950, because Hollywood Park was still recovering from a fire the
year before, the track ran a split meet, resulting in a nine-month
gap between the races.</TE>
<TE>   In late February, carrying 110 pounds to Citation's 132, Noor and
Johnny Longden beat the Calumet Farm nonpareil by 1 1/4 lengths in
the Big 'Cap. In some memorable battles, Noor would beat Citation
three more times in 1950, but Citation was finished for the year by
the time the Gold Cup rolled around in early December.</TE>
<TE>   Now Noor was packing the kitchen sink--130 pounds--but so was Hill
Prince at 130, and the eight-horse field also included another
Calumet star, Ponder; Assault, long of tooth but the 1946 Triple
Crown champion; and Next Move, the best 3-year-old filly in the
country. Around the time of the race, the springer spaniel of
Hollywood Park executive Webb Everett had pups, and he named every
dog in the litter after a horse in that Gold Cup field.</TE>
<TE>   Longden rode Noor to a one-length win over the longshot
Palestinian, with a troubled Hill Prince checking in third. Noor's
camp thought their Irish-bred deserved horse of the year, but when
the votes came in, the national honors went to Hill Prince, who had
won the Preakness and the Jockey Club Gold Cup and finished second to
Middleground in the Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-one years went by before Ack Ack duplicated Noor's feat in
1971. Ridden by Bill Shoemaker and trained by Charlie Whittingham,
Ack Ack was a horse who was impervious to high weights, in love with
off tracks. The Big 'Cap came up muddy as Whittingham smacked his
lips. With 130 pounds on his back, Ack Ack went to the front, led by
six at the eighth pole and won by 1 1/2 over Cougar II, carrying 125.</TE>
<TE>   Ack Ack, running for Greer Garson and her husband Buddy Fogelson,
who had bought him from the Harry Guggenheim estate for $500,000
early in the year, won twice more at 130 pounds, then was assigned
134 for the Gold Cup. The rest of the field ranged between 106 and
117 pounds, but Ack Ack easily disposed of the seven rivals, winning
by almost four lengths. A Gold Cup winner has never won under as much
weight. Colic almost killed Ack Ack later in the year, and he never
ran again. But the voters remembered, selecting him as horse of the
year in the first year that the Eclipse awards were installed.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, after Crystal Water won the Hollywood Derby, Shoemaker
urged Connie Ring, the colt's owner, to run in the Kentucky Derby,
but she and trainer Roger Clapp resisted. Crystal Water was better
for it as a 4-year-old in 1977. Despite some disappointing races in
the Strub series, he went into the Santa Anita Handicap as the third
choice, behind King Pellinore and Ancient Title. King Pellinore,
shouldering 130 pounds, ran third as Crystal Water, carrying 122 and
ridden by Pincay, beat Faliraki by a head. Clapp said later that,
just to play it safe, he had blown out his horse an eighth of a mile
the morning of the race, with an exercise rider who weighed 145
pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Ancient Title, a 7-year-old, was back for the Gold Cup, but this
time Crystal Water was favored and high-weighted at 129 pounds, four
more than his rival. Only a neck and a nose separated the first three
finishers, with Cascapedia second and Caucasus third. Ancient Title
was fourth.</TE>
<TE>   After Affirmed's Triple Crown year, the winter of 1979 brought him
and trainer Laz Barrera back to California, where he had prepped for
the Kentucky Derby. Despite winning the Strub by 10 lengths, Affirmed
faced seven hearty opponents in the Big 'Cap. Carrying 128 pounds and
ridden by Pincay, who had replaced the slumping Steve Cauthen for the
Strub, Affirmed beat Tiller by 4 1/2 lengths. Almost four months
later, in the Gold Cup, he carried 132, spotting Sirlad 12 pounds,
and beat him by three-quarters of a length. Affirmed earned
$275,000--$88,100 more than he got for winning the Derby--and the
Daily Racing Form's chart footnotes said it all:</TE>
<TE>   "[He] almost drew clear, then relaxed slightly in the closing
yards when it appeared he knew he had it won."</TE>

<LD>Chris McCarron's retirement has been a boon to jockey Mike Smith.</LD>
<LD>   The veteran has apparently become the No. 1 rider for owners Trudy
McCaffery and John Toffan and trainer Paco Gonzalez.</LD>
<LD>   Smith won two races Wednesday for the connections, scoring with
firster Cash Blizzard and first-time turfer Fair Bianca.</LD>
<TE>   This afternoon, Smith will make his debut on Came Home, the star
of the Gonzalez barn, in the $500,000 Swaps Stakes, the first of
three graded races on Hollywood Park's program.</TE>
<TE>   The $750,000 Hollywood Gold Cup follows as the fifth and then
comes the $200,000 A Gleam Handicap in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   A winner of seven of nine, all with McCarron in the saddle, Came
Home will be odds-on to win for the fourth time in as many races in
Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   In the seven-furlong A Gleam, Kalookan Queen is the 122-pound
highweight as she seeks her 10th win in 22 starts for owner Luis
Asistio and trainer Bruce Headley.</TE>
<TE>   The Grade II A Gleam is the next-to-last race in a pick six that
has a guaranteed pool of $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The eighth race at Hollywood Park will be a
spread for serious pick-six players. Contention runs deep in the
field of 12.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Skywriting. The Jeblar filly has won two in a row and
three of her last four and will step into stakes company today in the
A Gleam for owner Rosendo Parra and trainer Vladimir Cerin.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Der Rosenthing. The gelding, who has yet to hit the
board in 18 starts, is in for more punishment in today's sixth at
Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: An exacta box in the fourth using Hotel Hall,
Spycat and Royal Ambition.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/154. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $7/$873.40. Total money bet: $1,014.</TE>

<LD>Tim Huddleston of Agoura Hills won the 50-lap Southern California
Auto Club Late Model series feature race Saturday night in front of
5,950 at Irwindale Speedway.</LD>
<LD>   Huddleston led from start to finish to earn his second consecutive
win and fifth of the season. Series rookie Scott Youngren finished
second, Mike Price was third and Doug McComb fourth.</LD>
<LD>   In the 50-lap Ultra Wheels Super Truck series feature, Cory Fancy
of Palmdale was unable to hold off Temecula's Jim McGill, who took
the lead on Lap 39 and held off Joe Herold and Dave Blankenship for
the victory.</LD>
<TE>   The race ended with a spectacular piece of driving by Greg Adler,
who was pushed into the wall on the backstretch during the final lap
and rode the wall with his right-side tires before crossing the
finish line in sixth place.</TE>
<TE>   In the 30-lap Vista Paint Super Stock series feature, an eight-car
pileup on the first lap forced a reset of the race. That helped
Andrew Phipps claim his second consecutive victory; he held off
points leader Darren Cheek by more than three seconds.</TE>
<TE>   In the 35-lap Modified 4s feature, Guy Tripp held off series
leader Terry Limberopoulos to earn his third victory of the season.</TE>

will be trying for his 19th career victory against seven others in a
$2,000 claimer at 4 1/2 furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   A son of Pirate's Bounty who began his career in the barn of
Richard Mandella, Chapie was reclaimed June 13 by high-percentage

<LD>Josh Wolff scored twice in the second half and set up U.S. World Cup
teammate DaMarcus Beasley's overtime goal as the Chicago Fire beat
the New York-New Jersey MetroStars, 3-2, in a Major League Soccer
game Saturday in front of 22,070 at East Rutherford, N.J.</LD>
<LD>   Andy Williams and Mamadou Diallo scored for the MetroStars, with
Diallo forcing overtime with a penalty-kick goal in the 87th minute.</LD>
<LD>   The Fire (7-7-2) moved into a first-place tie with the MetroStars
(7-8-2) in the Eastern Conference.</LD>
<TE>   On Beasley's game winner, Dema Kovalenko made a steal near
midfield and found Wolff with a long pass along the right flank.
Wolff then made a perfect pass to Beasley, who scored past goalkeeper
Tim Howard 51 seconds before the second five-minute overtime session
would have ended.</TE>
<TE>   "When Josh and I are up top we use our abilities including speed
to our advantage," Beasley said.</TE>
<TE>   Wolff wiped out a 1-0 MetroStars' lead by scoring twice in a
three-minute span.</TE>
<TE>   His first goal came in the 53rd minute on a direct free kick from
30 yards. Beasley set up Wolff's fourth goal of the season by beating
defender Mike Petke to the ball along the left flank and passing
ahead to Wolff, who touched it past Howard.</TE>
<TE>   The Fire appeared headed for a win in regulation until referee Gus
St. Silva ruled that Rodrigo Faria was taken down inside the box by
David Vaudreuil. Diallo scored his eighth goal of the season on the
penalty kick.</TE>
<TE>   Wolff, stopped by Howard on a penalty kick in the 67th minute,
just missed a game-winning goal in the 89th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago, which has six players on the injured reserve list, played
without leading scorer Ante Razov. He sat out because of right knee
tendinitis.</TE>
<TE>   The MetroStars were without forward Clint Mathis (knee) and
midfielder Tab Ramos (hamstring).</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 2, San Jose 1--Ronnie O'Brien scored in the 87th minute in
his Dallas debut and San Jose's Jimmy Conrad scored an own goal in
the 50th minute as the Burn won in front of 13,035 at Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   The Burn (8-3-6), with 30 points, trails San Jose (10-6-2) by two
points for the league's best record.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose's Dwayne DeRosario scored in injury time to cut the lead
to 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   DeRosario had a chance to tie the score about a minute later, but
Steve Morrow came from behind him to deflect the shot.</TE>
<TE>   Conrad's own goal came in the 50th minute and gave the Burn a 1-0
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas' Antonio Martinez crossed a shot from the left side, Conrad
made a diving attempt to deflect it, then the ball bounced off Conrad
and past goalkeeper Joe Cannon.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien, signed by the Burn as a free agent this week, scored in
the 87th minute off an assist by Ronald Cerritos.</TE>
<TE>   Columbus 3, Washington 1--Brian McBride scored two goals to help
the Crew win in front of 13,665 at Washington and end Columbus'
three-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   McBride has four goals in three games for the Crew (6-8-3) since
returning from the World Cup. D.C. United is 6-9-1.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 4, New England 2--Chris Klein scored two goals as the
Wizards (6-5-6) ended a seven-game winless streak on the road after
scoring three second-half goals in front of 17,138 at Foxboro, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Leo Cullen scored his second goal in three matches for New England
(6-10-1).</TE>

<HD>Sauter's Gamble Pays Off, Beats Bodine for First Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Johnny Sauter went 112 miles between pit stops Saturday and outran
pole-sitter Todd Bodine following a red-flag restart to win the
NASCAR Busch series Tropicana Twister 300 at Chicagoland Speedway in
Joliet, Ill., the first victory in his career.</LD>
<LD>   Sauter last pitted on Lap 125, along with Bodine and Joe Nemechek,
for fuel and four tires. The trio was able to maintain track position
when the race was stopped on Lap 195 after Kasey Kahne crashed in
Turn 4.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't feel it was a fuel-mileage win," Sauter said. "I
definitely knew we were going to have enough. We just stuck to our
guns."</LD>
<TE>   Bodine finished second, followed by Jeff Burton, who had the
fastest car most of the day, and Nemechek.</TE>
<TE>   The caution came after many of the early contenders had made final
pit stops under green to take fuel. NASCAR officials stopped the
field on the backstretch for five minutes, setting up the dash to the
finish.</TE>
<TE>   Points leader Greg Biffle was one of those who pitted and found
himself a lap down. He finished eighth and padded his points lead to
47 over Jason Keller and 150 over Jack Sprague. Biffle had to start
from the back of the 43-car field because he changed engines after
Friday's qualifying.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Buddy Lazier turned the International Race of Champions event at
Chicagoland Speedway into a one-man show.</TE>
<TE>   The 2000 Indy Racing League champion led all 67 laps on the 1
1/2-mile oval and was the front man in a 1-2-3 IRL sweep--the first
time open-wheel drivers have done that since April 1996, when Al
Unser Jr. led Robby Gordon and Scott Pruett across the finish line at
Talladega Superspeedway.</TE>
<TE>   "I went into the race last in the points, and starting up front
and having clean air was what made it happen for me," Lazier said.</TE>
<TE>   Lazier started up front because IROC fields--with the exception of
the traditional season opener at Daytona--are set in reverse order of
points. Saturday's race was the third of four this season.</TE>
<TE>   Lazier went into the inaugural Chicagoland IROC event planning to
race hard at the start to try to stay in front and break the draft if
possible.</TE>
<TE>   He averaged 161.374 mph in the all green-flag race, becoming the
first open-wheel racer to win an IROC event since the IRL's Eddie
Cheever Jr. prevailed two years ago at Michigan Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cristiano da Matta, one victory away from setting a CART record
for most consecutive victories, easily captured the pole during final
qualifying for the Marconi Grand Prix of Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Da Matta, who has four straight wins, was more than four-tenths of
a second faster than any other car during qualifying--a huge gap in
auto racing--and more than one second quicker than six drivers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bliss set a NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series record for margin
of victory, winning the Kroger 225 at Kentucky Speedway in Sparta by
18.197 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   It was the third victory of the year and the second in a row for
Bliss and his red and yellow IWX Motor Freight Chevy.</TE>
<TE>   He won last week at Kansas City, Kan., and at Pikes Peak earlier
this year.</TE>
<TE>   The previous record for margin of victory was 13.186 seconds, set
by Sprague at Phoenix in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Bliss qualified second on Friday, despite breaking his nose in a
softball game the previous day.</TE>
<TE>   He wore bandages on his forehead and across his nose during the
race.</TE>

<LD>Mats Wilander, a winner of eight Grand Slam events, and Pat Shriver,
part of the most productive women's doubles team in history, were
inducted Saturday into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in
Newport, R.I.</LD>
<LD>   "It's kind of a defining moment in a lot of peoples' careers,"
said Wilander, a 37-year-old Swede. "It's something you never think
of while you're playing, and then you get the phone call and you
realize how special it is."</LD>
<LD>   In 1988, when he won three of four majors--falling only at
Wimbledon--Wilander wound up as the world's top-ranked player.
Overall, he won 33 singles titles, including seven Grand Slams. He
also won the Wimbledon doubles title in 1986.</LD>
<TE>   He won the French Open in 1982 at 17 years 9 months, becoming at
that time the youngest champion in a major.</TE>
<TE>   Shriver teamed with Martina Navratilova for 109 consecutive
victories from 1983 to 1985. Twenty of her 22 Grand Slam titles in
doubles came with Navratilova.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the Hall of Fame Championships, James Blake moved
closer to becoming the first top-seeded player to win the event in
its 26-year history by defeating seventh-seeded Michael Llodra, 6-4,
3-6, 7-5, to advance to the final.</TE>
<TE>   Blake will face Taylor Dent in an all-American final. Dent rallied
past Robby Ginepri, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1.</TE>

<TE>   Two-time champion Alex Corretja of Spain beat Czech qualifier
Radek Stepanek, 7-5, 6-1, in a match delayed almost six hours by rain
to reach the $600,000 Swiss Open final at Gstaad.</TE>
<TE>   Corretja, in his first tournament since losing in the French Open
semifinals last month, next faces Gaston Gaudio. Down a set and a
break, the seventh-seeded Gaudio came back to beat Ivan Ljubicic,
4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (2).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Moya and Younes El Aynaoui won in straight sets to reach
the final of the $381,000 Swedish Open clay-court tournament at
Bastad.</TE>
<TE>   Moya, the 1998 French Open champion, beat Agustin Calleri, 6-4,
6-2, and El Aynaoui breezed past Tommy Robredo, 6-2, 6-2.</TE>

<TE>   Four-time major champion Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario will play
17-year-old wild-card entry Myriam Casanova in the final of the
$140,000 French Community Championship at Brussels.</TE>
<TE>   Casanova, ranked 119th, upset No. 6-seeded Virginia Ruano Pascual,
6-2, 3-6, 6-2. The top-seeded Sanchez-Vicario advanced when her
semifinal opponent, Emilie Loit, quit because of a shoulder injury
after losing the first set, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Wartusch of Austria and Klara Koukalova of the Czech
Republic each rallied from a set down to win semifinals at the
$110,000 Casablanca Open in Morocco. Wartusch defeated Svetlana
Kuznetsova of Russia, 5-7, 7-5, 6-1, and the unseeded Koukalova
defeated Gisela Dulko of Argentina, 1-6, 7-5, 6-4.... Vera Zvonareva
reached her first WTA Tour final when top-seeded Paola Suarez quit
after losing the first set of their semifinal at the Palermo
International in Sicily. Suarez cited fatigue after losing the first
set, 7-5. Zvonareva, 17, will face Argentina's Mariana Diaz Oliva,
who beat second-seeded Henrieta Nagyova, 6-2, 6-3.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Montreal Expos gave their few die-hard fans--and a lot of
newcomers--something to cheer about.</LD>
<LD>   Brad Wilkerson, Vladimir Guerrero and Cliff Floyd each hit solo
homers in the fifth inning, and Bartolo Colon pitched his first
complete game in the National League to win his Montreal home debut
as the Expos beat the Atlanta Braves, 6-3, Saturday night before a
crowd of 17,335.</LD>
<LD>   Without a promotion to bring in a bigger crowd, the game drew the
fourth-largest crowd of the season as the second-place Expos moved
within 10 1/2 games of Atlanta in the NL East.</LD>
<TE>   "That one tonight was for the fans that have been coming out here
and supporting us all year long, and the extra fans that came out
tonight," Expo Manager Frank Robinson said. "It really gave us a real
boost, seeing them all in the seats out there, and their cheering for
us really made us feel good, picked us up."</TE>
<TE>   All three homers came off Tom Glavine (11-5), who surrendered
three homers in the same inning for the first time in his major
league career.</TE>
<TE>   Colon (2-0) gave up eight hits--including Chipper Jones'
eighth-inning homer--and three runs to send the Braves to only their
fourth loss in 21 games.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkerson led off the fifth with his 10th homer to break a 2-2 tie
and, one out later, Guerrero hit Glavine's first pitch for his 23rd
homer and his fourth in three games to make it 4-2.</TE>
<TE>   Floyd, who made his Expo season debut in Friday's 8-3 loss, drove
Glavine's next pitch 418 feet over the center-field wall for his 19th
homer of the season and first in a Montreal uniform since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 9, Florida 2--Matt Clement pitched three-hit ball into the
eighth inning against his former team as the Cubs and an angry Sammy
Sosa won at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Clement (7-6) struck out nine and outpitched the player he was
traded for in March--Julian Tavarez, who drew the ire of Sosa by
plunking him in the back with a pitch in the fourth inning. Benches
emptied briefly, but no punches were thrown and order was quickly
restored.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 7, New York 6--Travis Lee hit an RBI single off Scott
Strickland (6-6) in the 12th inning at New York as the Phillies
overcame another bullpen meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   Hector Mercado (1-2) pitched out of a jam in the 11th, stranding
the winning run at third base. Carlos Silva worked the 12th for his
first career save.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 2, Cincinnati 1--Craig Biggio hit a go-ahead RBI double in
the seventh inning at Houston, and Pete Munro pitched the Astros to
their fifth consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   Lance Berkman got his major league-leading 82nd RBI for the
Astros, who have won eight of their last nine and 11 of 13.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 2, San Diego 1--Kerry Robinson hit a run-scoring single
in the top of the 10th inning to give the Cardinals a victory at San
Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres squandered a chance to win it in the bottom of the
ninth when they had runners on second and third with one out against
Mike Crudale (2-0). Bubba Trammell hit a popup to second and Deivi
Cruz flied out to right to end the threat.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 5, Milwaukee 3--Brian Giles hit his 25th home run, and
the Pirates won in Milwaukee again. Pittsburgh is 6-0 this season at
Miller Park.</TE>

<HD>Giants Win Again to Tighten Race</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Jeff Kent didn't know he almost hit for the cycle. And it didn't
matter to him anyway.</LD>
<LD>   What mattered was another San Francisco victory--the Giants' fifth
in a row--further narrowing the race in the NL West.</LD>
<LD>   Kent went four for four and drove in two runs as the Giants beat
the Colorado Rockies, 6-1, Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Kent was a homer shy of hitting for the cycle.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I had no idea," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The former NL most valuable player last hit for the cycle May 3,
1999, at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Schmidt (5-3) gave up three hits over eight innings as the
Giants moved within two games of the Diamondbacks in the division.
Arizona took over the lead with a 7-5 victory Saturday over the
now-second place Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockies have lost four in a row, and didn't score in 21
innings until Chad Zerbe gave up an RBI single to Todd Helton in the
ninth. Friday night, Livan Hernandez threw a four-hit shutout in a
9-0 Giant victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockies have only nine hits in the last two games.</TE>
<TE>   "Our pitching has done a fantastic job," Kent raved. "They've
certainly proven it in the last two games."</TE>
<TE>   John Thomson (7-8) worked five innings, giving up four runs--three
earned--and six hits.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants took an early lead on Kent's run-scoring triple in the
first inning. It was his first triple of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Benito Santiago's solo home run off Thomson in the second put San
Francisco ahead, 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants scored two more runs in the fifth with the help of two
Colorado errors on the same play.</TE>

<LD>First place walked out of the Dodger dugout Saturday, hot and sticky
and angry.</LD>
<LD>   First place walked across the diamond and into the embrace of an
Arizona Diamondback team that wore it like a favorite old glove.</LD>
<LD>   It should have been a surprise, but it wasn't. First place being
no dummy, it doesn't stick around where it's not welcome.</LD>
<TE>   As three splendid weeks spiraled into three awful days at Dodger
Stadium, first place finally had the mat pulled out from under it.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the Dodgers lost to three errors and a bad umpire's
call. Friday, they lost to great pitching and impatience.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, they crumbled under pieces of all of it.</TE>
<TE>   First place waited until Dodger Manager Jim Tracy had his back
turned, then followed his sixth-inning ejection with its own
defection after the Dodgers had lost a 7-5 decision.</TE>
<TE>   First place could be back as soon as tonight, but it will be two
months before anyone around here trusts it again.</TE>
<TE>   "We've faced tougher and beaten tougher," Mark Grudzielanek said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe. Maybe not.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time they have lost more than three consecutive
games this season.</TE>
<TE>   The first time that this team's passion and confidence may be
injected with traces of doubt.</TE>
<TE>   There are 71 games remaining, enough to fill most of a summer and
fall. During that time, the Dodgers' true personality will be
revealed not in how they handle the Diamondbacks, but how they handle
this doubt.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't question how we'll handle anything," Tracy said. "I know
exactly what I'm going to get, the same thing I've gotten all year.
Not once have I come in here and not felt like we left it all on the
field."</TE>
<TE>   But not once has it felt like this.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodger bewilderment could be seen Saturday in impatient swings
and poor pitches.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodger wows might now be turning to wonder.</TE>
<TE>   They might be wondering, are they really destined?</TE>
<TE>   After all, for the second time in three games, they were hurt by a
bad call, and this one was a doozy.</TE>
<TE>   What happened to umpire Bill Hohn on Thursday night--costing the
Dodgers the tying run by ruling a fair ball foul--was an honest
mistake.</TE>
<TE>   But what happened to umpire Bill Miller on Saturday was a
reprehensible lack of hustle and focus.</TE>
<TE>   In the sixth inning, with the Dodgers trailing, 4-2, Steve Finley
led off with a walk and tried to steal second.</TE>
<TE>   He beat the throw, but then came off the bag. Cesar Izturis,
showing the savvy that has marked his rookie season, continually
tagged Finley until he was off the base.</TE>
<TE>   This was clear not only on the replay, but in the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Miller ruled him safe without following the play to its
natural conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy engendered this series' first standing ovation after running
from the dugout and eventually being ejected for arguing.</TE>
<TE>   But that couldn't change the three runs that followed.</TE>
<TE>   "It changed the entire complexion of the game," Tracy said, not to
mention his team's faces.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers might also be wondering, do they have enough depth?</TE>
<TE>   While the Diamondbacks were enjoying home runs from backups Rod
Barajas and David Dellucci, the Dodgers were again watching Terry
Mulholland get hammered while getting little help from their bench.</TE>
<TE>   True, Hiram Bocachica had a pinch-hit homer, but essentially the
Dodgers are trying to win a pennant with three players--Mulholland,
Bocachica and Jeff Reboulet--who are not part of any rotation.</TE>
<TE>   A team can hide one of those players, but three?</TE>
<TE>   "Our depth is our secret weapon," Arizona's Luis Gonzalez said.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't if you tell them," joked teammate Randy Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, everyone already knows. Even though Arizona has two of the
best pitchers in baseball, the biggest difference between these two
teams is that depth. Here's guessing that before the trade deadline,
General Manager Dan Evans will do something about that.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the Dodgers may also be wondering when those fresh legs
are going to start slowing down.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Green has been struggling to catch up with late-inning
fastballs. Eric Karros has struggled since the start of July. Brian
Jordan has had two hits in 10 at-bats in this series.</TE>
<TE>   And Eric Gagne seems to be working every game whether they need
him or not.</TE>
<TE>   He pitched Friday night in the ninth inning even though the
Dodgers trailed. And there he was Saturday, warming up in the eighth
and ninth innings.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't managing the game at the time," Tracy said, deferring to
bench coach Jim Riggleman. "But I've got a former major league
manager sitting there and I support everything he does."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Tracy was probably still calling the shots from the
runway, every manager does. But if he admits it, he could be
suspended.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever was the boss, it is risky business stretching the arm of a
closer so often during the middle of his first season in relief.</TE>
<TE>   Doubt never responds well to desperation.</TE>
<TE>   First place doesn't like it much, either.</TE>

<LD>Don't tell the South team that the 51st Shrine All-Star Football
Classic was an exhibition.</LD>
<LD>   The Southern California team dominated its Northern California
counterpart, 43-13, before 5,243 Saturday night at Mt. San Antonio
College in Walnut.</LD>
<LD>   The high school all-star game reverted to an all-California format
after seven years of matching a team of California players against
those from Texas.</LD>
<TE>   Long Beach Poly's Hershel Dennis, who recently learned he is
eligible to play for USC in the fall after achieving a qualifying
score on the SAT, ran for 93 yards in 20 carries and scored a
touchdown to win the most valuable player award for the South.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the real deal," said South quarterback Matt Moore. "I've
seen him on TV and I met him once before. He's two times better in
person."</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA-bound Moore, who led Newhall Hart to its fourth
consecutive Southern Section Division III title in December, ran for
two scores and threw for 146 yards, including a 12-yard touchdown
pass to Chino's Chris McFoy in the second quarter that gave the South
a 21-7 lead.</TE>
<TE>   A flurry of yellow flags came near the end of the second quarter.
The North's Brandon Lewis and James Henderson, and the South's Robert
Hamilton were ejected.</TE>
<TE>   "You have football players out there," Moore said. "Sometimes, the
emotion out there was bad. We knew that we were both playing for the
kids [at Shriners' Hospital], but when you get between the lines,
you're out there playing to win."</TE>
<TE>   Moore completed six of eight passes for 116 yards in the first
half. In the opening drive, he completed passes of 16 yards to Chris
Steck and 17 yards to Marcedes Lewis. Moore capped the 80-yard march
with a one-yard sneak.</TE>
<TE>   The drive exposed the disparity in talent between the teams. The
South was loaded with high-level Division I players. Ten UCLA
recruits were on the roster, and USC, Washington and Colorado also
had significant representation.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis, The Times' Glenn Davis Award winner as the Southland's
best high school player, and California-bound Donnie McCleskey of
Bishop Amat combined to run for 137 yards in the first half behind an
offensive line led by Robert Chai of Newport Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   "This was fun," said Chai, who will attend UCLA. "It's a great
honor to block for a guy like Dennis. You hear all about him and then
you finally get to see him on the field."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, tiny Sacramento State seemed to have the most
recruits on the North team. The squad's top player, Stanford-bound
quarterback Trent Edwards of Los Gatos, was limited by a heavy pass
rush.</TE>

<HD>Bollini (65) Scrambles to Lead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nico Bollini was born a scramblin' man.</LD>
<LD>   He has proved it since his days as a junior golfer and reaffirmed
it by finishing fourth in the nation among college players in sand
saves last season, his freshman year at USC. Bollini, 19, from Yorba
Linda, did it again Saturday in the third round of the Southern
Californian Golf Assn. Amateur Championship at El Caballero Country
Club in Tarzana.</LD>
<LD>   He hit only 11 greens in regulation yet needed only 22 putts and
shot a bogey-free, six-under-par 65 for a three-round total of
six-under 207 and a two-shot lead over second-round leader John Pate
of Santa Barbara.</LD>
<TE>   Bollini hit into six bunkers Saturday but saved par each time. He
hit into five bunkers on the front nine, yet made the turn at two
under thanks to birdies on Nos. 1 and 7, both par-fives.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel really comfortable in the bunkers for some reason,"
Bollini said. "I always have since I was a kid. I enjoy being in
trouble situations because I know I can get out."</TE>
<TE>   Pate, 42, the older brother of PGA Tour player Steve Pate, began
the day with a two-shot lead but couldn't keep pace with Bollini and
shot 69.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Won of Irvine also shot 69 and is at two-under 211 for the
tournament, four behind Bollini. Defending champion John Merrick of
Long Beach shot 68 and is at 212.</TE>
<TE>   Bollini played the first four holes of the back nine in 12 shots,
including a birdie-eagle-birdie stretch on Nos. 11-13.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I was putting well, so when I made the turn, I was looking
forward to what would happen when I hit some greens," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pate, who came from behind to win in 1999, doesn't plan on
changing his strategy in today's final round.</TE>
<TE>   "If he goes out and shoots 65 and takes only 22 putts again, then
there's not much I can do," Pate said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun to watch him do that. It'll be fun to be in the last
group."</TE>
<TE>   For 16 holes, it appeared Won would join Bollini in the final
group. The Stanford senior was five under for the day heading into
No. 17, but he finished with a double-bogey and a bogey.</TE>

<KH>SOCCER GRAHAME L. JONES</KH>
<HD>U.S. to Make Big Push for FIFA Cup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>OK, United States, what's next?</LD>
<LD>   How is a country that awoke briefly to the fact that soccer can be
a pretty compelling sport when the national team makes a decent run
at the World Cup going to keep the ball rolling?</LD>
<LD>   Well, there's the first FIFA under-19 Women's World Championship
in Canada Aug. 17-Sept. 1, but even though the U.S. will be among the
favorites, an age-level tournament doesn't exactly stir the spirit.</LD>
<TE>   Then there's the fourth Women's World Cup in China next year. The
U.S. is the defending world champion, but the Americans so dominate
their region that the Oct. 27-Nov. 9 CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup
serving as the qualifying tournament will be a mere formality. Fun,
but no high drama.</TE>
<TE>   And there's the Gold Cup itself--the men's version--that will be
played next year, July 12-23, at an undetermined location.</TE>
<TE>   But these days the men's Gold Cup doesn't have much more luster
than the women's, and only a U.S.-Mexico game would cause anyone
beyond the already committed fans to take notice.</TE>
<TE>   No, the next event that could put Clint Mathis back on the cover
of Sports Illustrated or Landon Donovan back on the "Late Show With
David Letterman" is the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a big if involved--as in, if the U.S. stages the
eight-nation event, which FIFA has scheduled for June 18-29.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans' rivals as potential hosts are Australia, France and
South Africa, and FIFA will make its decision known when its
executive committee meets in Zurich, Switzerland, on Sept. 23-24.</TE>
<TE>   Between now and then, the sport's movers and shakers in this
country are going all out to make sure the U.S. lands the tournament,
which would bring world champion Brazil, along with six other top
national teams, to these shores.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a huge opportunity for soccer in this country," said
Tim Leiweke, president of the Anschutz Entertainment Group, which
these days pulls more strings than U.S. Soccer itself.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we are going to be very committed to playing whatever
role the federation and CONCACAF want us to have to bring that here.
I think it's another milestone event for us.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not going to be a clear moment when soccer breaks through
in this country. There are going to have to be a lot of additional
steps. Yes, we've made progress, but we need more.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still many who don't believe the sport can be
successful here, and the Confederations Cup will be another
opportunity for us to prove that soccer has a very large base of fan
support in this country."</TE>
<TE>   Robert S. Contiguglia, the Denver doctor who is president of U.S.
Soccer, said the U.S. success in reaching the quarterfinals of
Korea/Japan '02 has increased expectations among fans of the national
team.</TE>
<TE>   "We've raised the bar and we now have to keep testing ourselves
and see how good we are," Contiguglia said. "Obviously, that [the
Confederations Cup] is a competition we would want to do well in and
I think we can do a real good job hosting it."</TE>
<TE>   Three factors operate in favor of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   First, Australia is a remote destination for any but the home team
and soccer is only a blip on the Australian sporting radar.
Comparatively speaking, the country is half a century behind the U.S.
in terms of its development of the game.</TE>
<TE>   That should be made obvious when the teams meet in a friendly that
Greg Bates, the acting chief executive of Soccer Australia, said
would be played later this year but which U.S. Soccer has yet to
announce.</TE>
<TE>   Even Bates has said that cash-strapped Soccer Australia's chances
are slim.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not one of the priorities right now, but we'd like to do
it," he said, "but regrettably in this country we've been poorly
organized, and we need to walk first."</TE>
<TE>   Even if they don't host the Confederations Cup, the Socceroos can
take part if they defeat New Zealand in Auckland today in the final
of the Oceania Nations Cup.</TE>
<TE>   France, too, would automatically take part regardless of whether
it plays host to the event because it is the reigning European
champion as well as the defending Confederations Cup champion.</TE>
<TE>   But its chances of staging the event are not particularly strong,
and worsened when UEFA said Thursday that Europe will pull out of the
Confederations Cup after the 2005 edition in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   FIFA seems unlikely to award successive tournaments to a continent
that would just as soon see the event disappear.</TE>
<TE>   South Africa might be a more serious challenger were this the 2009
Confederations Cup and were South Africa scheduled to play host to
the 2010 World Cup. But 2003 is way too early for the South Africans
to be needing a warmup for 2010.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a controversial event, but it constitutes an ideal test run
for the World Cup," Wolfgang Niersbach, vice president and chief
spokesman for the 2006 World Cup, said in Berlin in May, when Germany
declared that it would stage the 2005 Confederations Cup.</TE>
<TE>   All of which leaves the U.S. in a strong position.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't hurt, either, that the U.S. has a track record of
putting large amounts of cash into FIFA's no-longer-bulging coffers.</TE>
<TE>   The 1984 and 1996 Olympic soccer tournaments, the 1994 World Cup
and the 1999 Women's World Cup contributed sizable sums to the
positive side of FIFA's balance sheet.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the rest of the world has learned that we can put on
events," said Dan Flynn, U.S. Soccer's executive director. "I think
we have a relatively decent chance of getting it. We've still got to
work through some of the details."</TE>
<TE>   Those details include where the Confederations Cup would be played
in the U.S.--nationwide or on only one coast.</TE>
<TE>   "My guess is, if at all possible, we would probably want to spread
it around," Flynn said. "But we'll leave that up to FIFA."</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke sees Los Angeles being very much involved, even if the
Galaxy's 27,000-seat stadium in Carson--due for completion just weeks
before the Confederations Cup begins--will be too small to play a big
role.</TE>
<TE>   "The final would be too big for this facility," Leiweke said, "but
L.A. is fortunate. We have the Rose Bowl and the Coliseum. I think
we're reasonable and realistic enough to know that our role would be
some of the initial games and the quarters and semis, maybe.</TE>
<TE>   "The other role AEG can and will play is in being a co-promoter
with the United States Soccer Federation and CONCACAF.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope FIFA understands that it has an opportunity to break
through in this country and I'm hoping that at the end of the day
they see this as another way to continue the growth of soccer in the
U.S."</TE>
<TE>   The Confederations Cup would fall in the middle of the Major
League Soccer season, but Ivan Gazidis, the league's deputy
commissioner, said MLS strongly supports the tournament coming here
and would release players early so that they can prepare with the
U.S. team.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big tournament," he said. "Outside of the World Cup, you
don't get opportunities to play meaningful tournaments against the
best teams in the world very often. The Confederations Cup is one of
the primary world tournaments. We would treat it as we did the World
Cup. It's that significant.</TE>
<TE>   "We would love to host it. But regardless we have to put our best
team out there and do well in it to continue the momentum.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure we would release the players a month early, but we
would work with U.S. Soccer to make sure they have every chance to be
successful.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to be supportive of the U.S. team. It's great for all of
us."</TE>

<HD>Armstrong Puts Footnote on Stage</HD>
<DH>Cycling: He has to step on ground in minor crash with
teammate and falls 34 seconds behind leader Gonzalez de Galdeano.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE DeSIMONE</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>AVRANCHES, France</DL>
<LD>Lance Armstrong is perceived to be so invulnerable that it's
startling to see him take his foot off the pedal even momentarily.</LD>
<LD>   Armstrong lost a little time he'd rather not have lost in
Saturday's stage of the Tour de France. U.S. Postal Service teammate
Roberto Heras, who was in his usual position on Armstrong's back
wheel, was bumped by another rider less than two miles from the end
of the 107.4-mile stage and toppled into the defending champion.</LD>
<LD>   Heras' handlebars had to be disengaged from Armstrong's wheel
spokes while the rest of the team waited. Armstrong, who never fell
but did rest his foot on the ground, gunned his bike up the final
stretch and made up some of the time but finished the day 34 seconds
behind overall leader Igor Gonzalez de Galdeano of the Spanish Once
squad.</LD>
<TE>   The gap is far from a crisis for the Texan. Last year at this
time, he was nearly six minutes off the lead, and fell even farther
back after a bizarre 35-minute breakaway shook up the overall
standings.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we all know it's not possible to ride every year without
incident," said Armstrong, who added that it actually felt good to
push himself, albeit briefly, after a week of conserving his
strength.</TE>
<TE>   "It could have been worse," he said. "I'm honestly not concerned."</TE>
<TE>   All things being equal, Armstrong, who fell from third to eighth
in the overall standings, would rather not have given up an extra 26
seconds two days before the Tour's first individual time trial, which
is expected to provide the first real gauge of where Armstrong's
challengers stand in relation to the three-time winner.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez de Galdeano one-upped Armstrong in an individual time
trial earlier this season. But that stage in the Midi Libre race was
considerably shorter, and Armstrong has been dominant in longer time
trials.</TE>
<TE>   Postal wasn't involved in the worst carnage of the day. A late
crash on the final windy, twisting part of the course left bodies
sprawled on the road and in the ditches. France's Didier Rous is out
of the race because of a broken collarbone. French pro Christophe
Moreau bruised his tailbone.</TE>
<TE>   Heras and Postal's George Hincapie suffered scrapes in the
incident that involved Armstrong but escaped serious injury.</TE>
<TE>   Australian Bradley McGee of the La Francaise des Jeux team won his
first career Tour stage, literally upstaging Mapei's Pedro Horillo.</TE>
<TE>   As McGee throttled up behind him in the final yards, Horillo,
apparently misjudging the finish line, glanced over his shoulder,
then took his hands off the handlebars as if he were about to raise
them in celebration. In that moment, McGee swerved triumphantly
around him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Marco Pantani's eight-month drug suspension was lifted without
explanation by the Italian cycling federation's appeals commission.</TE>
<TE>   The 1998 Tour de France champion can return to racing immediately
and is eligible for the World Road Cycling Championship.</TE>

<TE>   Highlights from the seventh stage of the Tour de France</TE>
<TE>   STAGE: A 107.4-mile stretch along the Normandy battlefields of
World War II from Bagnoles-de-L'Orne to Avranches.</TE>
<TE>   WINNER: Australia's Bradley McGee, of the Fdjeux.com team, in 4
hours 10 minutes 56 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   HOW OTHERS FARED: Spain's Igor Gonzalez de Galdeano, of Once,
retained the yellow jersey of overall leader, finishing in a pack of
riders who clocked the same time. Three-time winner Lance Armstrong
was entangled in a late crash, finishing 27 seconds later. The U.S.
Postal Service team rider slipped from third to eighth place overall
and trailed Gonzalez de Galdeano by 34 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   QUOTE OF THE DAY: "There have always been crashes in the early
phases of the Tour. Today, there were no physical obstacles, it was
just due to the nervousness of the pack. I don't know what more we
can do to avoid them."--Tour de France director Jean-Marie Leblanc,
after a series of late crashes in the stage.</TE>
<TE>   NEXT STAGE: A 134.9-mile course through Brittany from
Saint-Martin-de-Landelles to Plouay.</TE>

<LD>The New York Liberty ended Washington's nine-game home winning streak
Saturday by defeating the Mystics, 67-53, behind Vickie Johnson's 19
points.</LD>
<LD>   The Mystics were 8-0 in Washington--the WNBA's only unbeaten home
record--and won their home finale in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a big win for us, to play a first-place team on their
floor and get an effort like we got," Liberty Coach Richie Adubato
said.</LD>
<TE>   Tari Phillips had 13 points and a season-high 12 rebounds, and
Crystal Robinson scored 15 for New York, which extended its winning
streak over the Mystics to five games.</TE>
<TE>   Coco Miller and Helen Luz each had 11 points for Washington, which

Holdsclaw, the team's leading scorer and rebounder. She has a
sprained left ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 63, Minnesota 60--Allison Feaster made two free throws
with 11 seconds left at Charlotte, N.C., to secure the Sting's
victory over the Lynx.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota, losers of eight in a row on the road, has not won a
road game since June 1. The Lynx had a chance to end the skid,
building a 13-point first-half lead before collapsing late. Svetlana
Abrosimova had 17 points to lead Minnesota. Tammy Sutton-Brown led
Charlotte with 13 points.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 75, Phoenix 66--Natalie Williams scored a season-high 22
points at Salt Lake City to lead the Starzz to their fourth victory
in five games.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Gillom scored 14 points, and Slobodanka Tuvic 11 for the
Mercury, who slipped to 0-9 on the road. They haven't won away from
